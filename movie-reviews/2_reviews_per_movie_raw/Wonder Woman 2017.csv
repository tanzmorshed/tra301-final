","I wanted to like Wonder Woman, but I just can't get aboard the hype train. It's really the same as every other cartoonish, overblown comic-book action movie, except with a female protagonist.<br/><br/>Actually, this is worse than the average comic book movie, because it preaches to the audience about pacifism but then hypocritically celebrates ""heroic"" violence. In other words: Wonder Woman is an alleged pacifist who kills a bunch of people. Wonder Woman is also an alleged feminist, who allows Steve Trevor to drive the entire plot and basically steal the movie from her. Really, this thing is about as progressive as Dick Cheney's great-great grandfather.<br/><br/>I could forgive Wonder Woman's flimsy social commentary, if it were any good in other respects. But the plot is loose and shabby, the CGI is poor, and about half the scenes were shot in front of a green screen. Sometimes, I couldn't tell if I was watching a real movie, or Patty Jenkins playing God of War on her Playstation 2. (When exactly did cinema and video games blend into this horrible hybrid art form, which has none of the beauty and charm of old-school cinema?)<br/><br/>And don't get me started on the villains. The World War I era Germans are depicted as cartoonishly eeeevil, while the same era's British Empire is held up as a heroic ideal. Meanwhile, the main villain is a nightmare of bad CGI, who looks like he belongs on a 1980s heavy metal album cover. Naturally, they got a wonderful actor for this stupid part and wasted him entirely.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm going overboard on criticisms, but we need some balance to the rapturous praise this film has received. Movie fans often accuse professional critics of being too harsh, but lately, I think critics have actually become too lenient. Mainstream movies get dumber, louder and tackier all the time, and they are increasingly substituting mawkishness for real emotion and character development. And yet the critics have given this thing a great Rotten Tomatoes rating! I guess we've all lowered our standards to rock bottom?"

","First of all, this movie only made money because it's a superhero movie. Everyone likes superheroes and there is no way a parent is not going to take their children to see it. Look at Transformers. Most of the movies are downright idiotic but it still makes money because it's.....Transformers. So all popular comic book hero movies will make money period. <br/><br/>I can't make sense of the movie and I really don't think the writers knew either. Her morales flip flop, the bad guy has no real reason to be ""bad"", the good guy has no real reason to ""die."" The side characters really didn't serve much of a purpose.<br/><br/>Some parts of the movie are decent and a few seconds later, the same scene turn into a total crapfest. The 3rd part is an utter mess and that act alone should be more then enough reason to keep WW off the top of the charts but somehow has a 94% rating on RT? That right there shows you that ratings are padded because you can't have at least 1/3 of a movie be total trash, 1/3 of the movie just corny dialog and somehow end up at the top of the charts."

","It is just that your acting is shaky.
It was a pretty boring movie and the ending was nonsense but a little forced because bringing back this franchise demands three movies and two sequels and they had to do this for money I suppose. It just didn't make sense and how literally everyone in the world did not find this land in seconds.
Also can you look at the Wonder Woman comic books and respect those just a little?"

","I'm definitely the minority here, but I can't get over the fact that this film is rated higher than films like Enter the Void, Moonlight, The Kings Speech, Spotlight and sooo many other much better films. The critics took the money on this one and ran. <br/><br/>To me, this film was cheesy, campy, and completely missed the mark. The ridiculous costume that is clearly symbolic for America ( there's clearly a fuc*ing gold eagle on her chest and it's red white and blue), yet she hails from Greece and calls herself an Amazonian God - WTF?!! AMAZONIAN!?!?!? I was so confused. Then, there is an American who is a British Spy (huh?) Most of the German Nazis speak with British accents and she can deflect bullets yet she loses her hearing to explosions.... I'm sorry, but I just could not get past this to enjoy the film. As an origin story, it's completely ludicrous. Maybe it worked back when the comic was written, but today it just comes off as a desperate attempt to pry the money from people that want to be viewed as politically correct. If you study film and take movies seriously, you should avoid a visit to the theater for this one. Watch it at home for free and make your own opinion, but I can see this media-con being laughable in 20 years."

","I was SO excited to see this movie and thirty minutes in I was......... BORED! And there was another 110 minutes left! The acting was not great and accents seemed to change every few lines for every character. It seemed like Gal Gadot was constantly posing for a photo shoot instead of acting - I think I caught ""Blue Steel"" face a few times. Gal is gorgeous but I did not get Amazonia princess from her - could they not have found an actress with muscle? Felicity Jones in Rogue One was more Wonder Woman! Of course the movie had to throw in the bits about being beautiful AND smart - but not too smart because a man had to explain snow and she was not so Amazonian that she didn't like looking drop dead gorgeous for the guys. Nope, no Wonder Woman here - just another Hollywood ""preach it"" to the public movie only this time the super hero is thin, scantily glad, super duper smartish/childish, and condescending."
"jameymessina","3","508","904","6 June 2017"," Not what I expected
","OK Wonder Woman review time ***Spoilers ahead***<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was sooooo slow I had to literally hold my eyes open to prevent me from falling asleep so im not gonna talk about it. Now correct me if im wrong but this was billed as a ""summer action movie"" correct? Well when its 2:10 mins and only about 15-20 mins is actual action I have a problem with that. Don't get me wrong when she was all kickin ass and whatnot it was awesome and I dug that part a lot, thats why its saddening to me there was so little. Also on the plus side the chemistry with her and Steve was good ... so of course he dies lol. (sidenote he would have made a good Green Lantern with the chemistry they showed) On the down side, once again a very slow movie till the bunker scene (which was bad ass) and then nothing again till the final fight which again there was no real Villain presence till the last 10 mins and even then she spent half of that time fighting mustache man Ares and not God of war Ares and as we all know for me the villain makes the movie. I give it a 3/10 its not bad like Ghost Rider/Fantastic Four bad its just not what I expected or hoped for at all."

"andre310778-35-614164","1","701","1262","3 June 2017"," Awful rubbish
","Saw Wonder Woman yesterday... quite frankly it's actually really bad. Story line all over shop, character development, all over the shop, main Charakter Wonder Woman stumbles through the movie like a naive 16 year old imbecile, she's a goddess for crying out loud, the logic for not telling her who she really is, screwed up and all over the shop. The way she kills Ares in the end, could have been achieved by telling her who she really was from the get go and a full 2hrs earlier, granted, it would have been a short movie but better. I'm not even getting into the feminism part of it. <br/><br/>In Greek mythology Amazons were mainly concerned with war and were rather brutal. To be expected if they were the supposed children of Harmonia and Ares. Yet in the movie they are portrait as peace loving, just, fair, superior beings to all mankind. But also especially superior to men who are essential for procreation and useless otherwise, really?!<br/><br/>It wouldn't have hurt if ""Wonder Woman"" would have hit the gym before filming commenced. But I guess if your main character believes that love is the ultimate answer to all of mankind problems, there's no need for that either. The rainbows one can vomit, lightning actually in this case, with all that fuzzy love feeling are blinding your opponents into oblivion, which she kinda did... there you go... The women training her in the movie looked fitter and in better shape than Gal Gadot despite being twice her age, at least in the movie. All this seemed like a bad parody of Thor and captain America, without the humour, without a plot, and atrociously bad acting from an otherwise good cast. <br/><br/>So all this really is, a quick money maker with main selling point: ""Female Lead"" <br/><br/>I am all for women kicking ass, in movies as a well as real life, here however, to me, it's all to artificial and contrived. <br/><br/>For example, in iron man one can believe the change Stark is going through, for one, out of necessity,shrapnel in his chest, for the other he decided to use his wealth for the good because he actually sees what his weapons are causing. <br/><br/>Captain America, he's full of idealistic ""Americaness"" alright but is cool, most important the character does not come across as naive. WW did not need to be so clueless. As far as the plot goes she's naive because she was sheltered from the world, fine, but yet she had access to literature about how Humans procreate but not about how the world outside her realm operates? And the character seemed to struggle almost seems to resist to accept the reality she finds herself in. Whereas good old captain America, after 70 years of sleep, just keeps kicking ass. <br/><br/>Her character development seems awkwardly written. To me, the biggest disservice to the movie. Overall the movie also felt sadly discombobulated. And then there is the WWI one setting... no one is expecting historic accuracy here, however, to try to glorify or find good in something that was so absolute and inherently not good. More specific to bring in the gas, as was used in WWI on a massive scale for the first time in modern warfare on top WWI having been a downright horror show in recent human history, dunno mate, it's bound to fail in a movie like that.<br/><br/>Marvel also incorporated WWII in Capo America, but didn't even try to bring in the concentration camps for example, it would have opened a can of worms the audience wouldn't have bought and it's not what captain America was about. Also the narrative flow is way better with Marvel I find."
"kendalleberly","1","698","1265","9 June 2017"," Terrible movie to watch, just a Captain America ripoff.
","Warning! Slight spoiler alert if you are going to watch the movie. Personally, i thought this movie was ridiculous. The entire movie was only tons and tons of filler with nothing interesting except for the three fight scenes, which were all ridiculous. Wonder Woman is to me just a ripoff of Captain America. The whole world war setting, the shield which can deflect bullets and mortar rounds, and how she can just dodge and see bullets coming, was pulled straight from Captain America. As a woman, i am an active feminist and i was glad they finally made a movie where women star in acting and directing roles. However, to me this movie falls just ahead of Catwoman in ratings. Don't waste your time and money with this movie."

","This movie was average, at best. Really poor acting on Gal Gadots part. The story was very predictable, CGI was poor, and the story was phoned in.

"gsdmorehead","1","325","590","30 June 2017"," Shocked at how this movie has received good reviews.
","I don't get it. I must be completely out of touch with what is popular for today's movie going public, and am scratching my head how this terrible movie receives such good reviews. This was the first movie I've been to at the cinema that I wanted to leave. I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. I decided to stay to see if things would turn around. Big mistake. <br/><br/>I fought back the urge to get out of my seat a further two times staying till the end. One of the only things keeping me going was getting home to go online and enjoy the critics laying into this atrocious movie. Only they didn't. They loved it. Apparently this is one of the best superhero movies of the year (""slash,"") ever. If so I'm glad I've avoided most of the others. <br/><br/>The plot and dialogue was extremely dull, and the WW11 setting didn't really take the film anywhere beyond the realms of mundane. People seem to be getting giddy about how the film represents a positive step for feminism. This again shocks me as the film seems to be quite anti-feminist in it's nature. Just because the films main character is a woman doesn't mean this film is feminist. I swear that most if not all the people who have rated this film highly have either been brainwashed, or they are idiots, I can think of no other explanation.<br/><br/>Back to the content, and after sitting through rather lousy dialogue, we get to the part in the film where, Diana is introduced to a trio of guys who are going to help her out in her mission. And what a trio they are, they get my vote for the worst characters in any film ever and instantly took this film from a 1 out of 10 to a -2. I'm not going to name them. They are not worth it. If they weren't bad enough the villains are also exceptionally bad, a grumpy Nazi general, and a woman with a disfigured face, covered phantom of the opera style, with the moniker Dr Poison. In another film this might be a fun nickname, unfortunately the grayness of the Nazi's and the backdrops we find them in just make Dr Poison seem dull. <br/><br/>There are a couple of fun moments in this film, like a trailers worth, and to be fair they are no means exceptional. Just plain standard. As such this is a film that has not pushed a single boundary. <br/><br/>Spoiler (this next part reveals what happens at the end of the movie.)<br/><br/>The worst part for me was the climatic battle at the end. It would take some extremely effective and persuasive acting for a British male mustachioed MP type to play Ares (based on the Greek God with the same name,) here we reach the films climatic failure. The fight now just seems stupid. For what, omg, that politician guy I never cared about is Ares! Facepalm. Most pointless twist ever.<br/><br/>Superhero films seem to be popular and make a lot of money at the Box office. Hopefully one day people will wake up and stop eating this garbage, and If you think this film represents a step in the right direction for feminism you probably need your head examined."
"cfriedel","1","546","1009","2 June 2017"," If you can think intelligently, this movie is not right for you.
","I really do not understand how this movie is being hailed as the ""best superhero movie of the year"" or the DCEU comeback to Marvel. This movie's script is terrible, especially the ending, which makes absolutely no sense (I will explain in the spoilers portion below.) It also doesn't really do anything to develop the characters. When they do take a minute to say something about someone or add a little character into themselves, POOF! They're gone, not likely to return. I can't really blame the actors and actresses here for anything because they try to work with what they got. Unfortunately, the script does nothing to help them along. That makes the dialog bland and cliché and drags the movie down even more.<br/><br/>Regarding the technical effects, they were OK. The CGI in the fight scenes had some really awkward looking shots, which made them look really manufactured. This is especially true in some of the sliding attacks. I almost wish that they utilized wire-fu/Hong Kong effects a little more in these types of movies as it looks more graceful and less ""weird"".<br/><br/>Overall, I say skip this one. There are better superhero movies out there and coming soon. Spending your money on this will just make you wish you had your money back afterwards.<br/><br/>--Stop here if you do not want to read SPOILERS-- --Stop here if you do not want to read SPOILERS--<br/><br/>OK, let's get to why the ending sucks so bad. If you understand how anything works, you will instantly disbelieve the decision of Steve Trevor to blow himself up in the plane. It makes absolutely no sense other than to anger Wonder Woman, which was already done with the shell hitting Veld and the flashback Ares shows her. Also, there are many ways that Steve could have resolved the situation without killing himself. First, he is in Belgium, so when the plane takes off, he could simply fly out into the water, drop the bombs into the ocean, then land the plane, either back in Belgium or in England. Second, they could shoot out the tires or the engines on the plane, making it impossible to fly. Third, he could simply radio the Allies from the plane, or tell the other guys to call (they did this earlier) and land in France. Any of these would have worked as he had control of the plane.<br/><br/>The second issue I had is the gas itself. They spout on about how blowing up the plane will effectively make a 50 sq mi. gas cloud, but not a minute or two later, the factory and everything around it is being destroyed. I'm sure there were still a few bombs left in there, yet everyone seemed just fine afterwards. Also, why in the world were guards walking around with gas masks when the gas was inside the bombs already? They drilled it into our heads about how the gas masks wouldn't work against it, yet the guards still decided to put them on? It's just dumb. Add in the fact that mustard gas is a blister agent, with no one in the town showing blisters, as well as the fact that they magically produce tons of this stuff in less than 24 hours for the big bomber and it is stupidly laughable.<br/><br/>What gets me the most about these logic issues are that it's the non-superhero stuff that they messed up on. You had two people (gods) flying and fighting in the air during the climax of this movie and, truth be told, that was more acceptable and believable to the story than a pilot getting into a bomber and blowing himself up. Honestly, skip this one."

","My dislike of it could be understandable since I dislike superhero movies for some reason; they just bore me. I'm not the biggest fan of action but I prefer a little action in stories.<br/><br/>This movie starts off with Diana reminiscing about her 5-year-old self. She wants to train in fighting and even recklessly jumped off a ledge.<br/><br/>Later, the movie time-skips to a pre-teen Diana in disbelief about what she's supposed to be doing.<br/><br/>I dislike dramas and not that big on war films so that's three things this movie has that I don't like. The action was too fast for my brain to handle (I don't know what they put in those scenes to make it hard to keep up with) This movie had too much crying and sadness from people in it for me. Even an annoying baby crying voice. The melodrama this movie had made me cringe and get nervous and this is the first film I walked out on. I don't like wasting money on movies but mommy and a therapist told me if a movie starts to make me nervous, I can leave.<br/><br/>This is the worst movie so far that I've seen in 2017 and that's saying a lot since Snatched could be considered the worst from the general public but I don't know Amy Schummer enough, nor do I have a disdain for her to hate it like other people do.

","seriously!? this movie deserves nothing more than 5 out of 10 stars. Terrible film. Acting was horrible. Story made little to no sense at all. Action was mediocre at best.. people need to realize that being politically correct doesn't require you to give this film a good rating. <br/><br/>1) the amount of cuts used was unbearable. When a director uses a lot of cuts, its usually because the scenes are action packed with timeless stunts. The stunts shown should not have required so many cuts. <br/><br/>2) the story was extremely rushed and left with plenty of plot holes. There was no introduction to her powers. just oh Zeus made you perfect. We do not know exactly what powers you have just that you're a god killer. Wonder Woman knows nothing about the political side of the war but automatically assumes with no good reason provided to her that the Germans are the bad guys.... what!? how is it we see her growing up as a child, then all of sudden stop aging. for a 100 years....

"namob-43673","3","276","509","6 June 2017"," Okayish, but moving too fast with bad CGI
","So, okay, this is a better movie then Suicide Squad (duh!) and it is an enormous leap forward from the absolute horrific stupidity of BvS, but is WonderWoman really a good movie? Well, nah, not really. It is decently entertaining and it does have several redeeming traits, but sadly not a very good movie. <br/><br/>Let us start with the bad. <br/><br/>The CGI is horribly bad. It is so obvious and so badly done I keep wondering if this movie was made in the early 1990's. I saw this movie the day after seeing Agents of Shield season finale, and AoS had 10-times better CGI. Did they not get money to do a WW movie? <br/><br/>The story moves way, way too fast, throughout the movie. They jump from this to this and there is no time to breath, catch up with characters or develop any sense of location. It feels like this movie should have been 2 hours longer and I can only assume it was cut down to fit the American public that love fast pace action set pieces. Diana is a kid, swhoosh, Diana is training, swoosh, Germans are evil and let this Jewish woman go kill them for some reason. Then they jump on a boat and faster than The Flash they are in London, and then swoosh they are in the war, then dancing and then off fighting and whopidoda the movie is over. I got the feeling I was fast forwarding 10-15min all the time. Did they cut out 2 hours? Was the script this bad? <br/><br/>The villains were pretty boring and badly flushed out. People keep complaining about Marvel villains, but this was far worse and in a fast pace movie like this you really do need to feel the strength and power and immense danger of the villain(s), but in this movie you do not. Not at all.<br/><br/>I also need to mention that I hate that the ""hero"" is fighting the poor Germans in WW1, of course the central powers and Germans were the good guys in WW1 (as far as such things goes in a world war), but the propaganda must go on<br/><br/>The good? Well, Gal Gadot is good as WW, most of the supporting characters are good as well. Most of the action, if you can ignore the bad CGI, is good. The general story, if ignoring all the plot holes, is compelling and there are a lot of fun and great moments in this movie. There is a good/great movie here somewhere, but it is cut away and hidden under badness. <br/><br/>If you can relax and just enjoy the ride and not let the bad elements mention above take you too much out of the movie this is okayish. I give the movie a 4 out of 10. It is entertaining after all, but not as good as Man of Steel which is still (to me) the best of the DC movies and also, strangely enough, the DC movie with least Christ-imagery <br/><br/>Are all DC characters supposed to be God? Or Gods? Is that the point? Boring. <br/><br/>Edit: Just saw the movie again last night and having time to focus on the movie and how good/bad it is, I detected a lot of other issues, inconsistencies and weirdo plot holes I missed the first time around. Consequently I will lower my score to a 3 out of 10."
"arielcatedra","5","207","381","24 June 2017"," Highly overrated movie
","So I decided to go and see the movie because 8.1 is such a good rate in IMDb. And seriously, what could be better than a hot girl with superpowers killing Nazis. However when I was seeing it I felt that it just was another superhero's movie with nothing to offer more than the same poor structure of the majority of bad superhero's movies: a half naive hero finding her path to kill an evil character that is the responsible of all the bad stuff happening in the world. In the mean time, the hero decides to believe in clichés like ""find love"" and ""everything is about what you believe"" and while she win the knowledge of those clichés, by very poor reasoning by the way, she increases her power to kill the evil character. So it was an extremely predictable movie that we all have seen 80 times but with a hot girl in it. Besides, the rules of the game were never clear, for example: at the end of the movie she decides to forgive the life of a German person because it was the right thing to do and she was so just and good, but during all the movie she was killing people, so one never understands where were the line between the good and the bad, the only thing that helps you to understand the line between the good and the evil was that in one side you had giggling English men and in the other side you had enraged Nazis. And on top of that, the characterization of Ares during the movie is just painful, they put it like a demon that believes that humanity is substantially bad and that they should kill each other for that, but Ares is the god of war and it also means understanding honor, courage and the beauty of the fight, which is very far from the Nazi's horrors. If Ares didn't exist, the Wonder Woman couldn't exist either because she is a character built on the vigor of war. I give it a few stars because the build up of the beginning was actually cool and kind of funny."
"smushsucks","1","242","451","13 June 2017"," Impulsive and Stupid Wonder Woman
","I'm not going to get into the generalities of why this movie was terrible, I'm going to be very specific about scenes that left a bad taste.<br/><br/>1. Wonder Woman's aunt sacrifices her life so that WW doesn't get shot from behind early in the movie. Later in the movie the villain tells her she's a god and only a god can kill a god. This renders her aunt's sacrifice an act of suicide because the movie went out of its way to tell the audience that all the Amazon Women knew she was a god. <br/><br/>2. WW's mom, the queen, tells everyone not to do something only to have everyone disobey her. Not just once, but EVERY time she says don't do something, someone does exactly the opposite. I.E. Don't train my daughter to fight, don't let this guy leave the island, don't go with the guy leaving the island. <br/><br/>3. WW essentially causes every innocent death in the movie. She leads a battalion through 'no mans land' and liberates a town. Then everyone in the town is killed by a gas attack that only targeted the town because it was liberated.<br/><br/>4. WW is incredibly impulsive and stupidly clings to mythology rather than listen to many people try to reason with her. Chris Pine repeatedly tells her to wait for him and she does the opposite. Wait outside this door, she goes in. I'm going to sneak into this castle in disguise, she shows up in an evening gown and blows up his plan. He tells her killing one guy won't stop the London gas attack. She runs off and kills that guy only to freak out on Pine because she was wrong. <br/><br/>5. Chris Pine's character commits suicide for no reason. He steals the airplane with the poison gas (which is conveniently flammable gas) and shoots it while he's flying mid-air; sacrificing himself to dispose of the gas. If he only thought to look for a parachute he could have left a grenade in the plane and jumped out. OR he could have asked WW for one second of help; instead he tells her he loves her.<br/><br/>All and all the movie is a cluster F and signals the entire DC Universe is going down in flames under this leadership."

She practiced sword-fighting and athletics, and suddenly she can follow bullets using eyesight and deflect them? She's also acting like her mind is miles away.

There's even a sex scene to top it of, even though Wonder Woman tells the handsome guy that they don't need men to pleasure themselves. Feminists must have loved that scene...<br/><br/>The handsome guy is way to under-explained, so are his buddies. I never cared for them at all. But whatever right? After all, I should be looking at WW. But the sad fact is, I don't care for her either! We see a few scenes with her as a little girl, and a few scenes with her as an adult before she goes out and steals the so called ""God Killer"" to run of with her new boyfriend.<br/><br/>Now, I don't know anything about WW, but this ""God Killer"" is supposedly an ancient magical sword to be used against Ares, the bad god. This actually made sense if it wasn't for the fact that it's a dud, and the true ""God Killer"" is WW herself. Surprise! And her mother obviously knows this, so she doesn't even care to make sure WW actually has the sword before she almost callously waves her only daughter farewell forever. In turn, WW herself doesn't care for her mother enough to reassure her she has the sword which would give her at least a fighting chance against Ares. This complete disregard of the sword, and emotionless farewell ruined the whole movie for me. Everything else simply added to my frustration.<br/><br/>She apparently knows all about the outside world, speaks like 2 dozen languages, knows all about sex without ever having had a real man in her life, but then acts like a little lost girl when she arrives in London. Apparently they forgot to educate her on ""modern"" society and how to conceal a sword and shield. And while we're at it, they also forgot to educate her about the world war that's been ravaging humankind. I mean, what the hell is that?! How do you protect humankind without knowing what's going on? Without ever having the chance to return home once you leave for battle? This is too stupid to even discuss.<br/><br/>Whatever..."

","I disagree with the hype. Spoilers WARNING...The script was pedestrian; the pace was scattered (too fast in the beginning, and too slow when putting the team together); the logic was heavily flawed (one night on a small sailboat in the middle of the ocean with no indication of where they were and you're in London the next morning? One person/Diana single- handedly suppresses a whole front line of gunfire with her shield and wrist-cuffs? A German sniper repeatedly missing multiple non-moving and completely exposed targets? Steve's team of mostly non-soldiers barging through a German camp without much resistance? A spy able to just blow up a whole camp by himself in broad daylight on the fly without being discrete?); wasted/under-explored story lines (Dr. Poison under-explored; Steve's friend, who's supposedly a deadly sniper, unable to shoot, huh?); the motivations/rationale for some of the characters' decisions were a stretch, if not unconvincing (Wonder Woman's mom initially not permitting WW to be trained in combat, especially when we found later in the movie that WW is the God Killer? Steve insisting on going after the German general while armistice was being negotiated? Team just decides to continue fighting without further pay after initially clamoring for money while nothing happens in the process that shows they're moved by something other than money?); unexplained parts that the audience is simply expected to accept (power of the wrist cuffs was never explained; Dr. Poison loses her notebook, but all of a sudden, just conveniently finds a scrap of paper that turned on the light bulb for her; Steve's conversation with Dr. Poison at the gala about seeing her experiment didn't make much sense at all). There are more other issues with this film, but there are more than enough listed above already. All in all, I saw way too many flaws in this film to agree with any of the hype."

","Whether or not you'll love ""Wonder Woman"" no doubt will depend on the individual. The die-hard superhero film lovers have embraced the picture and it's setting box office records...and these folks really shouldn't read or pay much attention to my review. This is because I am over 50 and got tired of the genre long, long ago. I went to quite a few of the films because my daughters love them and this time was was actually taken to the theater by my wife, as she loves the idea of a female superhero. So, if you fall into my demographics...this review is for you!<br/><br/>The story is pretty different from my concept for ""Wonder Woman"". This is NOT a complaint...I know a lot of superhero stuff changes. But instead of the WWII setting I expected, the film was set during the final days of WWI. The history teacher in me was intrigued...especially since they actually got the look of the film just right--costumes, airplanes, soldiers, etc.. They also heightened the bleakness of the era by severely restricting the color palate to shades of gray and brown--even the reds looked rather brown. I think this was a good choice...after all, war is horrible. <br/><br/>Overall, there really wasn't much to dislike about the film. It had TONS of CGI and action...and that is what many fans want. As for me, I would have liked a bit less and more focus on story....but that is a very typical complaint for folks like me! However, if you do get pulled into going to see it, it won't bore you and offers a few nice twists.<br/><br/>By the way, if you saw the film as well, were you ALSO horribly disappointed when the lady scientist's mask came off like I was?! I was expecting so much worse."

","I am a huge fan of Superhero movies and i had to say i was pretty excited for this one!! But just like every DCEU movie since Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy its just bad script and worse directing!!<br/><br/>Lets get to the movie now!! It started off really well and Themyscira was portrayed in a beautiful and untouched by modern era and they got it right.Stunning visuals and waterfalls and they showed us how Princess Diana is a ""FIGHTER"" by heart and always wanted to fight for what is right.Amazonian women were portrayed as strong and intelligent women which was conveyed through the initial few scenes. Just like every other stereotypical Superhero movie she will become a bad-ass within 10-15 minutes of the movie defeating everyone and uses her braces and unleashes a mega shock-wave accidentally.They don't show her using it again in the movie where she could have !!!! Here they mention something about her heritage and nobody has a clue what the hell was going on!!<br/><br/>Then she rescues the ""Dude in distress"" ....Steve Trevor and the movie just slows down to a pace just like the boat they set out to get out of Themyscira!! Few people die during the beach invasion as expected and a couple of scenes made me go Woahh but other than that quite forgettable.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot was really good at portraying Wonder Woman and behaves much like Thor when he enters Earth. Doesn't know the curtsies or the rules of the outside world.She was convincing as an intelligent woman who spoke more than 100 languages!! Throw in few more scenes of rescuing Steve Trevor from German spies.Here again they could have had some bad-ass action sequences but they didn't.<br/><br/>Finally as in every other Superhero movies the hero goes and fights the bad guys...was waiting for this for so long and this was just before the break. On the way the heroes party(Steve Trevor and WW) is joined by a couple of forgettable characters who were there clearly to add some laughs but didn't actually workout. one flaw i found here was Germans conversing with each other in English with bad accents. The casting choice for Ludendorff was really bad.Danny Huston was horrible as a German Military Officer and they keep calling their head ""KAISER"" which was how Germans referred to their head during World War One-according to the comics that's when actually Steve Trevor and Princess Diana meet not during World War 2.<br/><br/>We will skip to the Final Act because the scenes in between are really forgettable . The action sequences were so bad and the CGI was laughable at certain points.It looked like a video game at one point.<br/><br/>Final Act dropping the bombs in London.This is when the BS hit the ceiling!! Diana kills Ludendorff thinking he was ARES-but boy was she wrong!! Psych-It was the well mannered British Guy....ooh mind blown....NOT!!!! Another typical fight scene where everything almost seems out of hands and defeat for the hero and the entourage but through some act of human behavior the Superhero gains strength to kick the bad guy back to his place. Here again she doesn't use her powerful braces for the main villain!!!<br/><br/>Overall a really OVER hyped ,Cliched,Poorly directed,badly cast with a horrible story well of course Zack Snyder was involved what else did people expect the Story to be!!"

Ares was cast down by Zeus and the Amazonians were isolated into a tropical paradise yet we are not clearly given a connection between the two incidents as to why. Then, we get a lousy plot about how Wonder Woman leaves of to London just because she thinks Ares is the reason for the war. Diana's mother confides with someone else to not tell Diana that she is a god killer, but this is said when she leaves so what's the point? Then starts a typical war story where the heroes win a battle, then again see innocents die because of a man's mistake and the man sacrificing himself so the other's can live. Okay I get that they were trying to make him a hero but come on, this is it? The plot stinks... so many typical plot points are used uselessly to bring out a stubborn biopic of a god, at least the scenes are interconnected but other than that its useless. It's not BvS bad but it's near Fantastic Four bad... Definitely another DC movie to evade, not different from Suicide Squad when it comes to clichés.."

","Despite the need for female protagonists in action movies, this is the exact way NOT to go about it.
Poor acting, over-used CGI and poor plot points.
Women need genuine, interesting roles as actors and unfortunately Wonder Woman yet again perpetuates this idea that 'strong women' are only respected and believed by those around her if she's stunningly attractive and wearing nothing but a bra and mini skirt. Yes, I have no idea how this was made in 2017 since it feels more like a sort of teenage boys bedroom fantasy from the 1950s.
The whole movie can be summed up by one shot.
Imagine: Wonder Woman climbs up over the trenches into no mans land. With complete ease, perfectly curled hair billowing in the wind, a model pout, she bats away pullets all while keeping her perfect runaway walk going.
Firstly, an insult to war veterans to say the least, secondly, if that wasn't written by a teenage boy in his bedroom then I'll eat my cape..."

"wildhunt1-585-849528","1","312","616","5 June 2017"," Best DCEU movie yet--still doesn't say much
","Grade: 6.2/10, D+ 1/10<br/><br/>I'll just say it: Wasn't as terrible as I was expecting, but it was still pretty lame. Not good by any stretch of the imagination, but far better than anything DC has put out thus far. Patty Jenkins needs to be given a pat on the back for giving DC it's first non-vomit-inducing movie. Still, I wish WB would give us a superhero movie worthy of 2017 and not 1987.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot did surprise me, though. When she wasn't TRYING to act, she actually gave a good performance. The problem was, the rest of the time she was trying to act, and it showed horribly. And it did not help that EVERY, SINGLE action scene she was in that wasn't CGI'd was done in slow motion. When she moved fast, it was always from behind and you could tell that it wasn't an actual person. She still showed little emotion when she talked, reminding me of a contestant in a Miss Universe contest giving canned answers to stupid questions.<br/><br/>Chris Pine was Chris Pine. Nothing good or bad about that. He turned in the most solid performance of the entire cast, but even he felt to me like he couldn't believe he signed up for this movie or the DCEU in general. Probably had high hopes before the BvS reviews started piling in. He did the best he could with what he was given to work with.<br/><br/>Danny Huston overacted so much in this movie. There wasn't a single scene he was in that didn't make me cringe (funny, because I was expecting to cringe during all of Gal Gadot's scenes, and I only cringed through the scenes where she talked).<br/><br/>The secondary characters who made up Steve Rogers--er, I mean Steve Trevor's Howling Command--er, little group were nothing special. I mean, literally, they served no purpose that I could see in this movie at all.<br/><br/>The plot was nothing special. I've seen the three acts of the movie done in other movies and done much better than here. The first act on Themyscira was kinda terrible, with every Amazon speaking in a really thick accent to cover for Diana's. It made them sound clunky and not graceful, like you would hope Amazons would be. We got a brief history of the Amazons shown an an ancient iPad which just made made me roll my eyes. It was very reminiscent of the way Zod told Kal-El about Krypton in Man of Steel, just not as well done. And Themyscira was pretty, but Asgard in Thor was definitely more amazing. Also, they did not explain how Steve broke through the protective barrier surrounding the island. I suppose it was because Ares was back, but something somewhere might have helped.<br/><br/>The second act took place in London and Germany, and again, while it was done well, it was done better in Captain America: The First Avenger. But I will say the No Man's Land scene was probably my favorite part of the movie, and Gal's warehouse scene did put Batman's in BvS to shame. The third act was your basic CGI monster that you see in most superhero movies nowadays, but Ares wasn't terrible like Doomsday. But after seeing the final battle, it made me ask myself ""If Wonder Woman could do this, why did Superman have to sacrifice himself in BvS when Wonder Woman could have torn Doomsday to shreds"" so there is no consistency in her power.<br/><br/>The music was decent but kinda forgettable. They, of course, had the Wonder Woman riff play during the warehouse scene, but that was the only thing noticeable that I remember. Cinematography was decent and the CGI was good other than on Themyscira which just didn't seem to fit tonally with the rest of the movie. Pacing was decent, too. I didn't really feel like falling asleep, and while I think the movie could have dealt with a bit of editing, the only thing they could take out was much-needed character development--though they really could have done without Steve trying to explain sex and marriage to Diana.<br/><br/>If you liked the DCEU so far, you'll love Wonder Woman. If you hated the DCEU so far, you'll probably find it meh and not worth ever seeing again--and maybe not even the price of admission. I got to see it for free, so I'm not really complaining. I don't want my money back, but if I could go back in time, I'd tell myself not to see the movie to begin with, even for free."

I don't generally trust overwhelmingly good reviews and let myself be lured into the cinema by high ratings, but somehow I fell for the high score for Wonder Woman here on IMDb.<br/><br/>Maybe I wanted to be pleasantly surprised. Maybe I thought this could be the exception to the rule. At least, I didn't expect to be utterly disappointed and bored. <br/><br/>Where to begin? <br/><br/><ul><li>- - SPOILERS AHEAD - - - </li></ul><br/><br/>The only thing I liked about this movie was the early action sequence on the beach.

Not telling Diana who her father is 2. the 'train in secret' clichée 3. the 'average' joke 4. the dressing montage 5. the evil German killing his own men/how cartoonishly evil he was<br/><br/>the scarred, evil scientist that looks for a formula. 6. the unnecessary heightening of the evil guy's strength 7. the 'oh, Wonder Woman is so stunning' by every man in the movie 8. the late predictable reveal of who Ares is etc.<br/><br/>The whole time I was watching, I couldn't help thinking that this movie should have been called 'Steve Trevor' instead. He is the only one with a little character development, motivation and plot. <br/><br/>I hated that Wonder Woman was basically just following him around, deciding in the worst moment to do something foolish and run into a hail of bullets just to later lose what she fought for in that instance, then lose faith in an anticlimactic moment, after seemingly having reached her goal.<br/><br/>For a movie that wants to be progressive, it spent an awful amount of time commenting on how Diana was never dressed for the occasion. First in London, then at the gala in Germany. <br/><br/>And you know what? I felt bored. Really, really bored. No gripping story, main character or action.<br/><br/>The CGI was silly (lasso, bad guy's face, WW in some shots). The deflecting of the bullets was silly. The destruction of the tower and other brickwork was silly. The sword in the dress was silly. The resolution of the movie was silly. <br/><br/>If this review helps to stop only one person from spending money on expensive cinema tickets and popcorn, raises doubt in the mind of only one young writer about the quality of Hollywood scripts, makes only one person wonder if we have really come this far from 1950 sexist comic Wonder Woman becoming the Justice Leauge's honorary member and secretary, then I can call myself lucky."

","Is it just me or are the movies from Hollywood getting worse and worse? This movie was actually so bad that I felt the need to create an account here to review it and hopefully save a lot of people from wasting their money.<br/><br/>Where to start... The whole movie is a complete mess and the plot seems to lack any logic.<br/><br/>First off the movie was marketed as being about a strong female lead character to counter the never ending movies about men. This is a welcoming change in the movie industry but just like the recent ghost busters movie it really fell short. I was expecting a kick ass character like Ripley from Alien but instead we get this naive young women that needs to get told by the male lead character what to do. The plot was actually carried by men throughout the movie and instead of a movie empowering women it was a movie with the usual gender roles.<br/><br/>Anyway I knew from the first scene that the movie was going to be crap when they showed the earth from space and somehow the clouds was well above the stratosphere. The clouds where so big that you would think that it was on Jupiter.<br/><br/>The characters was shallow and you never got to know anyone. There is one scene where they sit around a campfire and talk about their backgrounds but they say like two lines each and that's it! even the characters in Pokemon for game boy was more developed.<br/><br/>Then we have the plot. It is the usual America is great and Germany is crap. The Germans as usual are depicted as soulless murderers. They are useless and miss every shot and get moved down by the 100s by 3 guys, sounds familiar? the chest plate on wonder woman even has the American eagle on it... The plot is also full of holes. I can honestly say that i was more lost during the movie then my lectures about Fourier analysis. There was so many whys going through my head that i could easily write down 50; why was the whole fleet after one spy?, why did the Germans stop assaulting the beach?, why did the Germans have the army uniform and not the navy uniform?, why isn't the island full of shipwrecks?, why haven't anyone seen a human before on the island? etc. you get the idea and this is only one scene in the movie!<br/><br/>Wonder women herself is overpowered. Makes you wonder why she needs anyone helping her? She is a demigod for crying out loud! Her powers are ridiculous and she is practically unkillable.

","I can't help but wonder if I watched the same film that impressed so many people. As with most DC Comics films, this one was a great disappointment. While Marvel Comics films tend to be satirical and even self-effacing, DC films are pretentious and tedious. Sadly, Wonder Woman was no exception to this rule.<br/><br/>The scripting was totally unimaginative, with dialogue that bordered on infantile. Visually, the landscapes all seemed plastic, with B-movie grade CGI throughout. Even the music was awkward, fighting the dialogue during the more intimate moments and drowning each scene in instrumentals. I found myself doubting whether the director and editor are aware that there doesn't have to be a bombastic or flowery incidental score under everything — it displayed a lack of confidence in the dialogue and acting carrying the scene.<br/><br/>Regarding the acting, both Gadot and Pine gave it their best, struggling with the stilted dialogue and boring, telegraphed story line — but even they couldn't transcend this quagmire. If not for its pretentiousness, this film would have played far better as a comedy, lampooning itself. Instead, it drowns itself in incessant platitudes of women good/men bad, framed within a plebian one-dimensional plot.<br/><br/>Again, I'm at a loss to explain its high marks, other than to ascribe it to the currently trendy political correctness that elevates all patronizing misandry to high art and entertainment."
"loco_73","Null","88","166","7 June 2017"," Wonder Woman And The Law Of Diminshing Returns
","Looking at the reviews and ratings for ""Wonder Woman"", gives me the sense that critics and audiences got caught in the hype and hubris of what this means and symbolizes versus what the movie actually is.<br/><br/>Because actually watching ""Wonder Woman"", what I was left with, war a rather mediocre, subpar and overly long movie, which did not escape the underwhelming cookie-cutter mould oftentimes movies of the superhero genre are subject and prisoners to. There was nothing above average about this film and worst of all and even unforgivable it was fairly boring and dour for a significant amount of time.<br/><br/>So where to start with this movie. I could write a whole essay about its flaws and shortcomings. But I won't. Suffices to say that problems abound in editing, pacing, cinematography, special effects, script, casting and so forth. Just to pick on a few examples, throughout the movie there were instances when the CGI was just bad, cheesy and looking completely undercooked and unfinished! Which is something you might forgive a TV series due to obvious budgetary limitations, but not a movie with a $150 million dollars budget! What did they spent the money on...catering? Actually I've seen modestly budgeted TV shows have better CGI than ""Wonder Woman"" had at times. <br/><br/>And what is with the frequent and repeated use of the slo-mo effects?!?! That special effect was innovative in 1999 when the ""The Matrix"" came out, by now as a tool of the trade it is played out and tiresome. The slo-mo effects have become Zach Snyder's calling card much like lens flares have become JJ Abram's. It doesn't mean other directors should emulate and copy them. Looking at you Patty Jenkins.<br/><br/>The cast I found rather bland and underwhelming. Edit: Actually I liked Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen in their roles, they looked and sounded the part, but had soo little screen time that they didn't have the opportunity to make a positive and lasting impact on the movie's overall quality.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Gal Gadot. She might look like a version of Wonder Woman, somewhat, but so do many fans in cosplay. I think casting Gal Gadot was more a matter of looks and style versus actual substance and abilities. I found her acting range to be quite limited and her on-screen presence rather stiff. I thought and still do that there are other more accomplished and versatile actresses who could have served the role and character of Wonder Woman better.<br/><br/>It looks like since Nolan's Batman trilogy, DC movie projects have taken an IQ dive...not that Marvel is any better...and that is in large part because Zach Snyder and co., have laid the foundation of what the DCEU looks, feels like and is. And now all subsequent additions to this cinematic and even TV universe are beholden and slaves to that vision. <br/><br/>Personally I would have loved to see what an unshackled Michelle McLaren could have accomplished with a movie like this.<br/><br/>And that is part of the overall problem. As movie audiences and critics, we've come to accept mediocrity in our entertainment (much like in many other aspects of our society), and we have been left with these increasingly higher scale, higher budget movies which deliver less and less. Whenever one even rises a bit above that line of mediocrity, we deem it a resounding success and reward it accordingly. That is the law of diminishing returns."
"justinpkelly","8","179","355","4 June 2017"," Inspirational and heart-wrenching
","It's no secret that the DCEU had a rough start. I personally did not like Suicide Squad or Man of Steel and, although I enjoyed Batman vs. Superman, I know that it is not a very good movie. Wonder Woman needed to be good. This universe was in dire need of a win and they absolutely got one with this movie.<br/><br/>First off, Wonder Woman herself was absolutely brilliant in this film. She was bright, hopeful, and innocent and was unbelievably likable. Gal Gadot played her wonderfully and I cannot wait to see more of her. I really felt that I had connected with this character on so many levels. Chris Pine's character was not particularly deep, but I still cared about him and loved his relationship with Diana Prince. They had fantastic chemistry and the way that they taught each other about each other's worlds was brilliant and made for some excellent comedy as well. I was incredibly saddened when Chris Pine's character sacrificed himself at the end of the film and Wonder Woman's tear- jerking reaction was very emotionally involving.<br/><br/>The action was fantastic, but that was no surprise since it looked so good in the trailers. The World War I sequence was ridiculously entertaining and I wish I could have seen more of it. The final sequence with Ares was also extremely exciting.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in the film was when Steve warned Diana not to cross No Man's Land and she climbs the ladder anyway. I got goosebumps all over and was on the edge of my seat. That scene was Grade-A filmmaking. Wonder Woman is extremely inspirational in this movie and that scene embodies her character. Scenes like that were the most memorable for me. As awesome as the action was, the moments that flesh out her character and her relationship with Steve were the best part of the film.<br/><br/>My main issues with the film mostly involve the villains. Dr. Poison seemed like she would be an intriguing character, but felt very bland and the movie never revealed what her true motivations were. General Ludendorff was an actual person in WWI, but his presence felt somewhat unnecessary and I did not feel that he was a great villain. The gas that he used to give him strength was also not needed and felt utterly pointless and out of place in the movie. I liked Ares, but the reveal of who his character actually was somewhat cheap. His motivations for showing the ugly side of humanity were very similar to Heath Ledger's Joker and I did enjoy that. My other main negative was that I also would have liked more emotional moments while Wonder Woman was on Themyscira, but I was satisfied with what we got in that particular part of the movie. <br/><br/>Another great element of this movie was the fact that it stands on its own. There's no forced reveal of any of the Justice League characters nor is there an unnecessary setup for that movie. You could argue that this is because of the time period that this movie takes place in, but I think that Patty Jenkins really wanted to make a film that was separated from the other DCEU movies. I absolutely loved the opening scene in which she opens up a suitcase from Bruce Wayne and views the picture of her from WWI. It was the perfect way to tie the film into DCEU without going overboard. It was also the perfect way to set the stage for Diana Prince's story. The closing scene where she thanked Wayne via Email was also cool. <br/><br/>The movie is also incredibly well-directed. Patty Jenkins is a true talent and I look forward to seeing what else she does in the DCEU and beyond. The movie is colorful, vibrant, and lively and looks utterly gorgeous. I loved the stark contrast between the clean, tropical Themyscira and the dirty, war-torn locations outside of it. <br/><br/>Overall, Wonder Woman really gave the DCEU the push it needed.

Like they KNOW we are that dumb and will just take it up. The story was god awful, stupid even by superhero comic standards and the acting was atrocious.<br/><br/>There was literally ZERO character development for any of them. No depth. It just all was whipped along as if for the sake of completing the movie. None of the characters were likable and relatable on a psychological level. Comic relief was forced and did not make us laugh. Watching Diana do her innocent act was totally unbelievable and as fake as it can get.<br/><br/>I fell asleep. My girlfriend well asleep and my friend who is generally very tolerating of dumb movies EVEN he fell asleep.<br/><br/>But that's okay, not a lot of movies are necessarily good.

BUT no - nothing like this happens, she kills Germans, everything is fine, the villager's greet them as liberators and thank them.<br/><br/>Which is actually just an incredible incredible downplay and rewrite of history.

","This movie is terrible. Not the worst movie I've seen by DC, that's Suicide Squad, which is why I'm giving a 2 instead of a 1, but still terrible.<br/><br/>There are plot holes and stupid decisions galore in this. The titular Wonder Woman is intended to come off as an intelligent but inexperienced, emotional character, but instead comes off as a self-righteous brat who knows only what the plot needs her to know. Her and the rest of the Amazons have a fluent understanding of all languages (with a random assortment of accents) but are apparently willfully ignorant of the cultures, countries, events and inventions of the world.<br/><br/>Princess Diana in particular is a holier-than-thou, we need to save everyone character, in the last leg of a war she didn't participate in. She judges everyone as cowardly or inhumane, but doesn't stop to listen what sacrifices had to be made or that suffering had been going on nonstop. She walks out to a battlefield and crosses a deadly No Man's Land with ease, ignoring that soldiers have died there for over a year.<br/><br/>It's easy to be judgmental when you're literally a superhero who can do anything, it's degrading to act that way to normal humans who die if they follow. Later she has a ""touching"" minute where the people she saved are killed, before running off and never addressing that point again or learning any lesson.<br/><br/>On the point of empty plot points, I suppose her family and friends are all horribly killed by the German destroyer that parked itself by their island, which is never addressed again.<br/><br/>The brat character kills Ares, whose entire (forced) backstory is a gross but acceptable deviation away from real mythology, saves the day, ends the war. No real mention or honest tribute to the millions who died to get there, just one mythical brat and her goodwill/badly written love powers for a character who sacrifices himself needlessly.<br/><br/>Go save yourself time and watch Sailor Moon. It's got more depth than this movie."
"evaxbos","2","119","236","26 June 2017"," This is NOT what a Female Lead movie should be like
","I never write reviews on IMDb, but I disagree so much with the 8+ rating I had no choice.<br/><br/>The aspect which bothered me the most about this movie, is that it is portrayed as a movie with a strong female lead. I expected Wonder Woman to be this cool warrior, being strong and independent and all that other things strong women should be. But in fact, Wonder Woman was just dragged from location to location by Steve. Every time Wonder Woman showed some fierce or anger, she was being shushed and told to leave (which she did). When Wonder Woman was introduced, the first thing mentioned is how beautiful she is. Further on, where are her muscles???! She is supposed to be a strong warrior, but apparently Hollywoods beauty standards are more important to portray. Another female aspect which was emphasized was her emotional side. In several occasions Wonder Woman portrayed empathy to humans, animals etc. which left her almost crying. The men in her environment told her to let it go (aka don't be such a pussy), while they showed no signs of emotion as the stereotype man. It is like Hollywood had the intention to make a movie with a female lead, but in the process decided that the female should be portrayed as usually is; beautiful, emotionally weak, needs to be controlled.<br/><br/>And now I have not even started with all the other aspects which makes this film so bad. Flat characters with very flat lines. Almost every line is some stupid one-liner full of clichés. The makers started off with WWII but halfway through switched to trenches and gas aka WWI? I guess WWII was not interesting enough. Furthermore, the story followed the typical story line build up, no surprises there. And of course more things which did not make sense at all (the gas in the plane would kill everyone in an area of 130km square if grounded, but hey if I fly it 500 meters up and blow it up no problem). The last line of the film and thus conclusion made the whole film silly: only love can save the world... OH come on!"

"kalimarah","3","119","237","19 June 2017"," Serious Greek Myth Fail
","This review focuses on Greek Mythology in the Wonder Woman story line, or rather the lack of it. I expect superhero movies to play fast and loose with history and myths. As long as its fun, all is forgiven. Unfortunately, the WW movie didn't rise to this low bar.<br/><br/>On the positive side, it was nice to see that the Amazons were placed on a Greek Island, instead of somewhere else on the planet. The island and the training amazons were pretty cool. That's where it stops.<br/><br/>We were introduced to a creation myth where the head god, Zeus, created mankind and made them good. What? Zeus didn't create humans. He disliked them, except when he was having sex with them. The titan Prometheus created humans out of clay and Athena, the Goddess of Cities and War (yes, there is more than one war god), breathed life into them. Zeus tortured Prometheus for allowing humans to walk upright and use fire. Neither the gods nor humans were good or bad in the Greek mythos. They simply were.<br/><br/>Then Ares (the male god of war) led a rebellion against Zeus. Killing all the other gods. Well, this at least has mythological precedent. The gods under Zeus led a rebellion against the titans and cast them into the underworld. However, Ares seems to have done this all alone.<br/><br/>Zeus then created the Amazons to defeat Ares. What? In actual mythology, the tribe of Amazons were the offspring of, wait for it.... Ares and Harmonia - a nymph. So, Ares is WW's father, not brother.<br/><br/>Ares then devotes himself to corrupting mankind for the rest of his existence. Odd, in Greek history, the Greeks were so busy waging war they needed two gods to keep up. No corruption necessary.<br/><br/>Finally, Zeus, creates a child of his to serve as a weapon against Ares to save mankind, Wonder Women. Really? This sounds odd and forced in a Greek setting. That's because it is. There is another setting where all of this becomes very familiar: the Bible. The Christian God created humans and made them good. His head angel, aka the Devil, rebels against him then devotes his existence to corrupting humans. So, God creates a child of his to help humans resist the corruption, Jesus.<br/><br/>Why in the world do we find the bible story as the central plot of a superhero movie? It doesn't make much sense, cheapens the story of the Christ, and obliterates the Greek myths in the process. There are a lot of other issues with this movie, but I have a hard time letting this go."
"thomas-79548","3","115","229","25 June 2017"," Bad. Really bad.
","Warning Spoilers!!!!!! I was very dissatisfied with this movie. I did not live up to the hype or the reviews it was getting. Here is why: I thought it was going to be done as realistically as possible other than the fact there was an amazon goddess. Instead what I got was incorrect Greek Mythology. The movie also presented general Ludendorff as the ""main enemy"" when actually after Ludendorff was killed Kaiser was still alive so the war was not over. Kaiser also had no board to consult with to negotiate an armistice because Ludendorff and ""professor poison"" killed them all. As a person who knows about WW1 history I was extremely disappointed. There were also three characters that they tried to implement but were not memorable at all. I can't even remember they're names and I watched the movie half an hour ago. One of them was a sniper who apparently can't shoot! For this point I have to give a little backstory. Professor poison made a mustard gas that substitutes sulfur for hydrogen making gas masks useless. Ludendorff then puts the gas in bombs and the bombs on a plane. There is a moment where all the bombs are exposed while being carted to the plane. It is later revealed that the gas is flammable (well obviously, it's hydrogen!!). So if this sniper guy shot the bombs then they would instantly catch on fire and the death of many (including one of the main characters) could have been avoided."

"jaredpahl","3","13","21","26 June 2018"," Blunder Woman. This Critical Darling Is No More Than a Mediocre Superhero Origin.
","I wanted to like Wonder Woman. I thought I would like Wonder Woman. I had a sneaking suspicion that I might love Wonder Woman. Hey, critics practically fell over backwards praising the film as not only one of the greatest superhero movies ever made, but a historic step for womankind. And while I've learned in the last few years to not put too much stake into what critics say, even from the trailers, Wonder Woman looked appealing to me. I love DC Comics, I love old-fashioned adventures, and I love Greek Mythology and WW1 history. How could I not love Wonder Woman? Well, it's because Wonder Woman is not the masterpiece critics have anointed it as. It isn't even a success by the meager standards of modern superhero movies (it's been compared to The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2, when it is actually more like Green Lantern crossed with Thor). Wonder Woman is a bad movie. A standard, by-the-numbers superhero origin with dull characters, pointless action, and incomprehensible themes about the power of love (or something).<br/><br/>Wonder Woman, as a character, does have one of the more interesting origin stories among DC superheroes. Steeped in Greek mythology and grand in scope, Wonder Woman's origins as a Greek demigod, modeled from clay by Hippolyta (played here by Connie Nielsen) and brought to life by Zeus on a hidden paradise called Themyscira, is perfect cinematic inspiration. It's no wonder then, that Wonder Woman's first twenty minutes are its best. The early scenes on Themyscira suffer from the same stilted dialogue and dubious acting of the rest of the film, but they are bright and colorful, and at that point in the film, the action is actually fun. The Greek mythology stuff is interesting, and while the first act is no home run, it's entertaining. When Chris Pine's Army pilot Steve Trevor shows up on the island, and the setting shifts to WWI-era Europe, Wonder Woman begins its long spiral downward, until the whole thing crashes to the bottom of the superhero barrel in the final act.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot plays Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, and you've probably heard the praise. The role has launched her into stardom and granted her an almost God-like status among the select group of feminist superhero fans. You want the truth? In the role of Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot is... Well, she's got the build, she's got the looks, she has moments when her fish out of water schtick works, but she is barely an actress. The handful of moments when she has to get riled up and stand up for herself and her mission to kill Ares (the Greek God of War, assumed to be living as a German officer, for some reason) flop. I'm sure the devout feminist cult of Gal Gadot loved these moments, but to me, it seemed like Gadot could barely get the lines out correctly, much less give them any impact. Her struggle with English washes away any pretense of her as a genuine actress, and exposes the tall, Wonder-Woman-looking model underneath. She could have been much more annoying, but nevertheless, this is no ""great"" performance.<br/><br/>And speaking of overrated women involved with Wonder Woman. Director Patty Jenkins. She's female, and she directed a superhero movie. That seems to be enough for critics to elevate her to the highest level of the industry. Her exclusion from the Best Director Oscar nominations was considered a ""snub"" by many. Puh. Lease. This is no great directing job. Let's look to the action scenes as an example. Early on, the action is kind of fun; staged competently, and bearing some creative and cool stunts. However, somewhere along the line you start to notice that these sequences are peppered, infected, overrun, with slow motion, bad CGI, and totally unearned grandiosity. Eventually, Wonder Woman absolutely devolves. Soon, it all becomes mindless, pointless, stupid, rubbery CGI crap. The final fight, without spoiling too much, sucks. And its monumental stupidity alone should have been enough for somebody, anybody, to give a negative review to this movie.<br/><br/>But alas, critics ate this crap up. It would be baffling if I didn't know exactly why. Wonder Woman marketed itself as a feminist triumph before it was seen by anyone. A female-led superhero movie, directed by a female, with a message about female love and compassion conquering male aggression. No feminist worth their salt would dare speak ill of such a historic piece of entertainment. And no feminist did. Like Black Panther after it, critics interested in keeping their ""woke points"" were held hostage by the hype. It doesn't matter if Gal Gadot can't act, or if all the secondary characters come off as cartoons, or if Patty Jenkins doesn't know how to handle action. It's a big-budget ""feminist"" movie, so it is important. Therefore, no matter how bland, dull, tedious, and dumb Wonder Woman is, it was destined for great reviews. It will get no great review from me. I wanted to like Wonder Woman, but I have the guts to tell you, it's no good.<br/><br/>39/100"

While having a nice framework of ""who is good, who is bad"", ""is men good or bad by design, innocent but manipulated by higher forces"" etc. it gets lost in exposition, a rather scattered assortment of scenes and bad guys that are not memorable.<br/><br/>A big disappointment was Ares - mostly because i could not look past seeing Remus Lupin from Harry Potter there. I do like the actor but his performance was weak, not at all menacing - not in a sense of godly power, nor in the sense of manipulating intelligence or even arrogance. He was just Lupin in a silly costume made of too much bad CGI.<br/><br/>The setting of WW1 could have been good - if it had actually described WW1. The characteristic of the desolate no-mans-land, the stalemate and the human meat grinder was only really pointed out in a short scene - and then quickly forgotten. The rest could have been a stock WW2 battle, too.<br/><br/>The movie itself had pacing issues in my opinion. It started with the childhood of wonder woman on her home island. At that point - the story was coherent and compact - with few but memorable characters. Once she left the island though...... the story began to dissolve into small scenes of quickly changing locations. There was no connection with the new characters (the members of the team), no connection to the village they ""liberated"" - and the enemy side was just a bunch of weak villains.<br/><br/>All in all ... i had more fun watching Batman vs. Superman ... and i did not really enjoy that very much either.<br/><br/>It is a shame, because i think that Wonder Woman herself was well acted and done in that movie - only the story was bad (i have seen many MUCH better ones from the DC animated movie features in the past years - so i know they CAN tell good stories) - But a superhero is only as good as the villain they fight... and the villain was disappointing."

They get from paradise island to London in one night in a sailboat and don't freeze in the cold ocean weather. On the sailboat, the feel the need to tell us Diana has read 12 books on sex. Why? She also decides that pleasure doesn't come from sex? Again, why share that? Diana walks around London with a sword, nobody says anything. Diana only really kicks butt after sleeping with Steve, and decides only to fight for love. Say what? Diana disappears during WW2, Korea, Vietnam, etc. She doesn't fight with humanity during any of these events, where did she go? How do we still have war if she killed the God of war? Diana loses her sword in her battle with the God of war, but has the same sword in BvS? Makes no sense! Seriously, this is just a short list of everything wrong with this movie.

"ericjcant-1","5","59","121","17 June 2017"," So this is what a 92% rating on RT is these days? No IQ required.
","I don't think I've ever seen a movie so highly praised by professional critics for its good intentions and important PC issues, yet unconcerned with the standard aspects of quality movies such as plot, pacing, internal logic, originality and all the other things that get in the way good ratings. There are lots of movies that teach important cultural lessons. For example, The Care Bears movies. Both Wonder Woman and the Care Bears movies are packed with good moral lessons on important topics such as equality, love, and overcoming adversity, but Wonder Woman gets 92% on RT whereas the average Care Bears movie hovers around the 70% mark. Both are conveniently simplistic where story logic and common sense aren't that important and both fight against the evils of society.<br/><br/>With that said, here is what I really did not like about Wonder Woman. First is that it seemed a bit familiar in how she fights a world war with a small band of men in Europe. Yep... Captain America: First Avenger, except that Wonder Woman's group seems to literally serve no purpose, so the only reason I could see for them being there is because there was a group with Captain America? Next issue, way too many convenient story elements. Things just happen to show up at the perfect moment in the most obvious of circumstances. This happens so much in this movie that it starts to feel lazy and dumb. My final issue is that all the villains are not only morons, they are boring morons. The entire movie feels fake and uninspired. Now, I will say that Wonder Woman is moderately entertaining if you are willing to not think about it with even the tiniest drop of scrutiny. Otherwise it poofs into the air. I actually wanted Wonder Woman to be a great movie, but its just so obviously dumb that you can't ignore its stupid script. Gal Gadot did a fairly decent job if you have to sit through it, but it's a silly movie."

","I was very excited to see this given all the hype and positive reviews. Not to mention my girlfriend wanted to see it, and there's not many she actually wants to see.<br/><br/>I doubt you can imagine the level of disappointment I felt by the time it was over. And I honestly have no idea why so many people think it's so amazing.<br/><br/>WWI was a huge tragedy, but the first war that was very well documented. And I would have thought that if they had picked that for a setting, that there could have been some semblance of realism somewhere. Not to mention some way of involving her in events that actually, or at least, might have happened. So maybe that's nitpicking. But from start to finish, the plot in general had holes big enough to drive a warship through.<br/><br/>I can't really comment on the acting as the script was so bad I don't think anyone could have saved it.<br/><br/>It would have also helped if it would have had a great, or even good antagonist. But the villains here got so little screen time, they never felt even a little threatening.<br/><br/>A good supporting cast could have made it better as well. But they too seemed to get no character development, and didn't seem to have too much of a reason to even be there, aside from the odd bit of comic relief and to remind us of how gorgeous Wonder Woman is.<br/><br/>Technically, there was nothing special about it. The CGI was nothing special and the editing left me wondering how much had been cut out.<br/><br/>On the plus side, and maybe the only positive about the whole movie, was that Gal Gadot looked great as Wonder Woman. But really, the only reason I can think of for all the glowing reviews, is that people love watching a hot woman kicking ass and taking names (and she didn't actually take that many names...but she did kick a lot of ass though)<br/><br/>And in case you're curious, my girlfriend liked it a whole lot less than me."
"matiasirigoyen","5","50","101","8 July 2017"," Not what i hoped, Thought they had nailed it this time.
","I don't know if the problem was the directing or the script but there's something missing from this work. I don't understand the good critics it received and i assure you i'm not saying this because i'm a cynical bastard who just wants to give a bad critic. <br/><br/>What i think is that somewhere in the process of filmmaking the acting was damaged and great actors like David Thewlis and Ewen Bremmer couldn't make up for it. Some scenes from Gal Galdot were very Ackward like the part where she's talking to Ares and she says ""I compel you to tell me the truth"" (see what i mean?) and i think the main problem was her interaction with CGI. She probably wasn't coached properly to interact with those moments and i don't know why the director didn't noticed that.<br/><br/>Then there was this feeling that many moments didn't cohere properly with each other (The town and then the gala and then the destroyed town and then the military base) and that other moments were forced into the story. (The beautiful singing of Ewen, The fight between Gal and Chris and then his magical appearance in the middle of a military base without any sign of opposition from the many soldiers there, etc)<br/><br/>Veredict: I don't think that is the worst super hero movie i've seen but it's definitely not one of the good ones. I also think that many of the film issues have to do with the directing and the script and due to those facts the performances of the actors were also damaged. DC please wake up."

"androrain","2","75","158","11 June 2017"," Warped and too lengthy
","DISLIKES<br/><br/>1- This movie is far too long and inflated with unnecessary lines. Diana is too preachy; her self-righteous monologues and dialogues contribute nothing to the film, to the contrary, they rob the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film. <br/><br/>2- This is a fantasy/action movie but there is not much action and, the mixing of fantasy with an element of warped history does not help either. Of course the producers were aware of what they were doing. They deliberately depicted the Turks as the partners of the Nazi Germans who developed chemical weapons during WWI. Sorry, I am not a 5 year old and I know for sure that Nazi Germany had not existed until 1930s and the Turks had stayed neutral during WWII. Actually, to the contrary of what the movie shows, the Turks saved a lot of Jews from the hands of the Nazis. If the producers were looking for a Nazi collaborator, I wonder why they didn't chose a different nation who indeed helped the Nazis during the war e.g Switzerland, Sweden, Italy or Japan...I wonder if John Kerry used his influence over the Hollywood producers when he met them last February. Of course, one should know why the US has created so many superhero Hollywood characters. Such superhero characters have merely served towards the US's goals during the 40's, 50's and the cold war era against the Soviets (Capitalism V Communism). By the looks of it such superheroes will serve the US's foreign policies for a long long time to come. <br/><br/>3- The message of the film is rather laughable considering the number of people Diana already killed, her shouting about love at Ares was particularly silly at this point. First kill and then send love messages. Yeah sure... We have seen this scenario in real life indeed. No, the world does not need a superhero thank you Bush, Obama, Trump, Kelly... <br/><br/>LIKES<br/><br/>1- This is not a low budget film by any standards. Costumes, special effects etc were all good. <br/><br/>2- It is good to see a strong female superhero amongst the male dominated superhero characters. <br/><br/>3- Fighting scenes were good but I would have expected to see more of them."
"TheGamingFalcon101","1","7","10","12 June 2020"," A boring, horribly taken film worsened by terrible acting from Gal Gadot.
","I hated this film because I love Wonder Woman- the character. I grew up reading Wonder Woman comics and watching animated media related to Wonder Woman and I was so excited to hear a live-action film was taking place.<br/><br/>But my hopes were destroyed when Gal Gadot was cast. She doesn't remotely look like the iconic Diana we know and love and I didn't know who she was at all. Only after googling I found out she was a menial character in Fast and Furious and did movies that weren't box office hits. But her acting was horrible, she was wooden, lifeless and couldn't deliver dialogue or heroics. She was terribly miscast and someone competent who can act and looks like Diana should've been cast.<br/><br/>Whilst Gal Gadot terribly disappointed in her acting, Patty Jenkins equally disappointed in the movie itself. I struggled to get myself interested and nearly half the cinema lost the will to live. The movie was so boring, people were sleeping. There was a slow and bland progression throughout the movie. The action and dialogue were so tasteless that I felt I was watching a watered down fan film done by inexperienced people who never made a film before. Whilst Chris Pine and David Thewlis played their part well, Gal Gadot's misery cannot be ignored. It is evident Patty hasn't read any comics as she clearly didn't understand the character. Heavily overrated film!<br/><br/>The music was decent and the CGI was below average. This abysmal film made me lose hope in any future Patty or Gal films and in any DCEU Wonder Woman sequels. If it were up to me, I wouldn't have cast Gal Gadot nor hire Patty Jenkins to run the film."
"prospectus_capricornium","10","308","712","2 June 2017"," A Visual Extravaganza Brimming with Heart and Reason
","Patty Jenkins' 'Wonder Woman' movie begins with a rocky, uneven start. But this very flawed pace allows the origin story of the amazonian warrior mature in a compelling build- up, and eventually navigate towards the rest of her story in a riveting seismic progression. It gathers an affectionate sentimentality that sustains its potency even amidst the imposing explosive sequences that often triumph to take the audience's attention away from the oddly satisfying distraction, that is Gal Gadot. There are these resonating anthems that remain ablaze throughout the film's 140-minute duration: love and peace, sacrifice and courage, and while it gets extremely preachy sometimes, the narrative rarely gets boring. Jenkins' take on the genre doesn't abandon the idea of terror, and mass destruction, but it singularly escapes the confines of superhero clichés that eliminate its players' moral form. In 'Wonder Woman', Diana Prince's humanity is held by Gadot's portrayal with a bracing commitment, something she never loses even when confronted with the deceptive appeal of evil and darkness. Her heroic verve gets an unexpected reinforcement from Chris Pine's Steve Trevor, with whom she shares a surprisingly inherent chemistry. This is the first DC film in a very long time, to ever sustain such visceral distinction, a visual extravaganza brimming with heart and reason.<br/><br/>Diana Prince's story takes us to a mysterious island known as Themyscira, hidden by Zeus in a protective dome of dim and mist, far from the grasp of humanity. She grows to believe that it is her sacred duty to protect her world, not knowing such 'world' will include what is beyond the clouds. But when the first man arrives in a suspicious water- crash landing, she expands her understanding and begins to welcome the idea of defending whoever needs help in the other side. But this eagerness barely entirely rests on a moral responsibility; she believes that Ares, the God of War, and her inevitable nemesis, is what causing the war waged by humans, and she needs to kill him in order to restore peace to both worlds. In one spine-chilling moment within her breathtakingly choreographed fight sequence with Ares, Diana rises from a fall, and virtually carries out her meteoric ascent, a symbolic assumption of her superhero status.<br/><br/>But in spite of the amount of physical tension and visual explosion, Jenkins balances the flavor by injecting humor and romance, utilizing them even in places where gripping action sequences are imminent. Chris Pine shines in his own moments, a remarkable feat for a character in a saga that seems to underscore women empowerment. There is a powerful moment where he grapples for words to ask for Diana's help to win the war; he practically breaks down, a stirring and moving scene to behold. Part of the film's colossal allure is its heart--it never loses it, doesn't intend to, and it grows to more awe-inspiring forms as it reaches a resonating, albeit predictable, resolution.<br/><br/>It is ironic to think that Diana Prince isn't human, but appears to be the most one, when compared with her colleagues in the looming 'Justice League' film. In the end, 'Wonder Woman' isn't a film free of blemishes as it still stumbles upon political truths it rarely gets justified, and minor expositions it doesn't seem interested to shed light on. But it has soul, humor, and wonder-- a narrative spectacle one seldom finds in a film of its sort."

"kilpatrickarlo","5","31","60","24 August 2017"," The definition of overrated
","Let me just get it out of the way. I am a DC fan. I have vastly preferred all the recent DCEU movies to the newer stuff marvel has put out (aside from suicide squad!). Yes they have their flaws but they felt like a breath of fresh air from the light hearted marvel movies which were beginning to loose their charm. Then Wonder Woman came along and I must say it looked very promising... I was hyped. And so the reviews came flooding in and they were all very positive which was a big surprise! I was going in with high expectations. I came out disappointed. <br/><br/>Before I start ranting on about how overrated Wonder Woman is I want to say that the first act of the movie (in Themyscira) was amazing. From the cinematography capturing the beauty of the island to the battle against the soldiers on the beach. It was all great. Then this epic start that promised a good movie was ruined as the characters entered London and all the comedic one liners began to come in. It suddenly didn't feel like a DC movie. Yes I know it's okay for the odd joke but come on we're in the height of World War One here and you're giving us all this jokey dialogue... No thanks. <br/><br/>Then eventually we meet Dr poison and some army general who's name I forget. Wow. These guys are worse than any marvel villain. Period. They were left completely undeveloped by the end of the movie and had hardly any screen time. Speaking of villains who had hardly any screen time, ares who I guess was supposed to be the main villain was terrible. They built up all this tension that ares would be the general when in the end he was some character we'd seen for about 5 minutes at the start of the movie. Talk about an anticlimax. The final fight scene was awful. Just awful. The definition of a cgi mess. And why did ares still have the face of the human he disguised himself as when he went into his god form. Who knows?! That's when I dropped out and couldn't be bothered paying attention to it anymore. Transformers does cgi fights better for god sake. And when I said this movie was overrated on YouTube I realized how toxic we DC fans are. All of them started attacking me. Can we really not take criticism?! If this was a marvel movie it would be a whole different story for the DC fanboys! They'd hate it and talk about all the points I've mentioned!<br/><br/>In conclusion I really don't get why everyone loves this movie so much. It just feels like another generic superhero movie with some extra flaws. Nothing special here :p<br/><br/>4 or 5/10"

","Let me start out by saying I have never been a huge fan of superhero movies. From time to time I will discover one that I actually do appreciate, and after hearing from my friends about this movie.. I thought this might be one of them. From the plot dragging on to the characters not contributing to the story, it goes without saying I did not appreciate this film. The actress who plays Diana seems to me unlikable as she does not develop throughout the story and seems to be too strong headed to do anything but what she wants to do. Chris Pine, however, plays a character who actually seems to develop and become a better person. The special effects were very obvious and seemed cheesy. I found myself constantly checking my watch to see how much longer this meaningless plot would go on. Needless to say I am not sure why this movie got such great ratings."
"rarthurc","1","53","110","2 July 2017"," Wonder why so much praise
","Despite the initial intrigue posed by a prominent female main, this film is lacking in the extreme. The studio decided to take a feminist route for god knows what reason placing a somewhat successful female drama director in charge of a superhero action film. The quality of this picture is more in line with some of the less successful superhero TV shows. The acting is lacking throughout, with no emotion in the characters, unlike in Zack Snyder's underrated Prequel. There is no motive and the action is too slow which makes the whole thing look extremely dull and unrehearsed. The only positive thing in the film is the fact that a woman takes up most of the screen time, but in all she's a bad actress. She looks as out of place on the screen as her character in the cabinet room. I hope to see better acting from her in future as there is so much potential. In all its a failed attempt at female empowerment that makes me throw up. There's no story, no cinematography and I hope to never see such a failure again. -Arthur"

Still...This movie suffers from the same reason as the other two movies, which is action and villains...It's too much CGI and a lot of times it is too obvious, it just ruins many of the action sequences. This goes for the final battle as well. It's just worse, the main villain does not represent a danger in any way. It just floats in the air and that's all...wtf...

It's like a wet fart instead of full-blown diarrhea. <br/><br/>It starts out so terribly slow. The fighting scenes of amazons at the start look impressive, but are very unrealistic and it didn't feel like any of the punches or blows really hit. The accents are really distracting and annoying. This is just the first 15 minutes and already so much goes unnecessarily wrong.<br/><br/>This movie actually has really good ideas from time to time, but as for every dceu movie that is released it's just poorly executed. The pacing is bad and feels off and there is little to no character development for any side character. Even for Wonder Woman it's very sparse and it's supposed to be a freaking' origin story. There is no believable and well worked out moment of her finding herself or figuring out who she wants or needs to be. Gadot being so unbelievably beautiful is what saves her character. <br/><br/>This movies is so bad at making you feel the emotions the characters are feeling and on top of that it isn't able to make you care. You understand why she feels the emotion she is feeling, but you just don't care, because there is little to no build up. You have to really take a step back and think about it and force yourself to care, because the movie doesn't do this for you.<br/><br/>This is supposed to be such a good movie for feminism and women in general, but ironically it's the male supporting character that steals the show. The best and arguably only real good thing about this movie is Steve Trevor. Pine's charisma and the surprisingly good writing and dialogue of his character really save this movie along with a few fun and innocent comedic reliefs here and there. He is also literally the one who saves the day with a heroic sacrifice and Wonder Woman just sort of cleans up the mess.<br/><br/>I want to give this movie a 5/10 or 6/10, but since the overall score is extremely skewed as of now I have to give it a 1.

She charges at a bad guy, destroying the bell tower of a church, creating a havoc full of dust and dirt, but her hairstyle is still up to an advertisement for a shampoo. She's trained to fight with a sword, but her costume leaves most of her skin uncovered for some reason.<br/><br/>When one tries to make a feminist movie, one should ask oneself how many 14-year-olds will pause in the middle of a dramatic scene to fap to the lead character, because that's what happens when the focus is on sexiness of costume design rather than on depth of character development. Maybe choosing Zack Snyder as the writer, author of Sucker Punch, were a group of girls looking like dolls fight a bunch of Nazis, wasn't such a great idea. The power that Wonder Wonder holds in the movie is purely physical. This is not what feminism needs. Where are the scenes where WW has a brilliant idea, takes a game-changing decision (apart from what starts the movie), or gain deep respect from her peers? There is none."

","Worst movie I've been dragged to. The want my money back kind of movie. Nothing original. Predictable. Nothing new or surprising. Prefabricated patterns put together as a hay stack. Terrible acting (mostly...). I agree that it is a difficult fantasy story, but... well, it's not even funny."
"MovieChopper11","1","58","122","29 June 2017"," A waste of time...
","What is hard for me is to find a good part in this movie. I just can't... What is clear for me is that Hollywood desperately wants our money without delivering too much in exchange. Folks, it begins to be really unfair! <br/><br/>Plot/Script: a tasteless, boring mix of clichés and twisted mythology. An Amazonian daughter of Zeus (Hmmm...), who doesn't know who her father is will save the day in World War I. Of course, no matter what, the British Empire is good and Germans are bad, of course Germans must have a Nazi look (in World War I..., WTF??), otherwise why would you put a former member of IDF to play Wonder Woman...? And, at the end, a fight with a god with a lot o fire in the background. But wait, at least Ares, the god of war, has a mustache! Just ridiculous! The entire script is fragmented, characters remain undeveloped sufficiently, logical fractures everywhere, i.e. why put yourself in the bullet's way to save someone who cannot be killed by anything? <br/><br/>Acting: just as you may have guess, Wonder Woman is played bad by gorgeous Gal Gadot. Nothing but a series of poses for magazines, trying to look innocent but also bold and intelligent. Okay, the script didn't helped her at all but the same bad script was played also by Chris Pine and it's something else. In fact, this movie is quite a waste of many talents to produce two hours of nothing.. Just about to forget: in my opinion making David Thewlis, a great actor, to be Ares in this movie is an idea just as bad as making Adam Driver, another great actor, the new Darth Vader.<br/><br/>Effects: I think more than half of the movie was shot on green screen. Some scenery is good but some not. Why all the fighting scenes were shot in slow motion? Why they look like a circus ballet? Good CGI technically speaking, but quite unpolished artistically.<br/><br/>Music: Not bad. Not memorable either. You would expect more from a talented composer as Rupert Gregson-Williams who is also, as far as I know, a member of Hans Zimmer's Remote Control Productions team. But hey, he can have bad days too, can't he? And maybe, just maybe, he made the music in the same line as the movie: nothing remarkable. In my opinion, a unique superhero should have a unique musical label in movies. I've heard a few days ago on the radio the main theme from Superman. There is some distance, my friends, quite a distance! Where are you, John Williams? <br/><br/>Costumes: the only special costumes are those of the Amazonian warrior ladies, which all look like a small upgrade of Xena. Not bad in the end but not impressive.<br/><br/>Overall, a bad movie, made not to entertain but to squeeze money. Very overrated, I simply cannot imagine on what grounds one should rate this crap 8 out of 10. This is why I'm giving a 1 of 10, to lower this inflated rating. However, the real rating from my point of view would be a 3 out of 10, no more."

One example of poor action: sniper on the tower usually means nobody can expose a finger, yet all 3 men run out into the open unharmed and for what?...to hold a piece of metal 1 meter above the ground so she can jump 30 meters into the air??? And a scene that seemed to be an editing mistake. When meeting Ares she reaches for the sword (the one she lost easily in the previous fight, got beaten with it and then forgot it on the roof), the sword is not there, nothing happens then next scene she appeared to be coming down from the roof with the sword while Ares was waiting calmly (probably she asked him for a time out to go get the sword :) )"

"toby_gosling","2","54","113","13 June 2017"," Not bad
","(actually 6/10 just compensating for the way too high ratings)<br/><br/>I saw it today and overall it was pretty good, it wasn't a bad movie but wasn't the best. Zack Snyder's mark of bad dialogue and overall skill of making movies worse in general was clear.<br/><br/>Like most of DC's movies now, there is a lot of scenes and situations that don't make much sense. The most memorable for me was in the tower at the end where she is facing Ares. She reaches for Godkiller but it's not there, she left it impaling Luddendorf, making the viewer think this will create conflict. Then it cuts to a scene with Chris Pine, then back to WW jumping down now with Godkiller. So Ares just stood there and let her jump up and get her weapon? <br/><br/>A similar thing happened when she was fighting Ares on the runway, and Chris Pine came over and talked to her. Ares was just chilling there letting her talk? <br/><br/>Another annoying thing was the slow-mo. This effect can be used to good effect to let the viewer see an amazing movement that would be missed in normal speed. However, there is no point in using it on every.single.movement. WW in slow-mo, Amazonians in slow-mo, every bullet in slow-mo. It was ridiculous by the end.<br/><br/>With the casting, David Thewlis is a great actor and I do enjoy his work, but he just didn't seem the right fit for the God of War. You imagine Ares as being intimidating and imposing, not having a moustache, being rather slender, and being super-British. <br/><br/>Overall though, the story was tolerable, and the action was decent most of the time. Gal Gadot is also gorgeous which doesn't hurt, but it didn't feel they tried to over-sexualise her which was also good. It was still far better than Batman v Superman, and most DC movies, except the Dark Knight trilogy. Still leaps and bounds behind Logan, and Marvel still has the edge."
"jackjack-2","1","57","120","2 June 2017"," If you watched the Carter original, you will be sadly disappointed.
","Anyone who saw the original Wonder Woman movie, as bad as it was,wlll find the original far superior to this piece of crap even though the newer version is full of cinematic gimmicks which the original did not have.Lind Carter was not the greatest actress but compared to Gal Godot, Carter was by far the best Wonder Woman. Besides Carter is beautiful, Gadot is very unattractive. I suspect that those who exalt this film are feminists.<br/><br/>And compared to the original movie, this one is badly directed. It lacks cohesiveness and credibility. It is as others have noted, a badly flawed flick. If you go to watch it, don't have high expectations because you will really be disappointed. The flick got a lot of undeserved praise.<br/><br/>The only reason I went to see this flick was to take my 14 yr. old granddaughter and my 17 yr. old grandson. My granddaughter loved the movie, my grandson was bored by it, thought it was a waste of time. But I can understand why anyone who is still a juvenile at heart might enjoy this fantasy. Also, why viewers who were not old enough to watch the original Wonder Woman had nothing to compare the latest flick with the original. It is like the James Bond movies. The original Sean Connery versions were by far the best but as the movies went on and new actors became James Bond, they couldn't match Sean Connery. Likewise Gadot is no Lynda Carter. And I don't mean to compare the James Bond movies with the DC movies because the DC movies including the latest Wonder Woman are not even close to being in the same class as the James Bond movies. It is like comparing the Untouchables with the Brahmans.<br/><br/>Another thing that one has to wonder. Wonder Woman was not released until June 2, yet there were so many reviews written prior to that date. So is someone stacking the deck in order to get people to watch the flick?"
"rafaellodino","1","22","41","22 July 2017"," Wonder Woman is just another failed FEMINIST propaganda movie
","The whole social media (including the IMDb & Rotten Tomatoes review sections) is full of teenagers who rate this movie a 10 like this would be a similar quality movie as The Godfather or Pulp Fiction. Worse is that some newspapers reviewers also rated this movie as very good which is how you know they have been paid or that they are desperate to be politically correct! <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is full of nonsense, first of all why is the story set in WW 1 instead of the dark ages where it's outfit belongs ? Well, probably because the producers went to Israel to find a woman who can play this character , they could not find one in USA or Europe !? Why did they go to Israel for this woman (who cannot act or speak English)? Maybe because the action of the movie was set in WW1 and a Jewish woman fighting the Germans would be a symbolic message! <br/><br/>But Hollywood did not stop there with the symbolism, they used a real life German general name in this fictional movie: Ludendorff - a real German World War I general. They could have made up a name but Hollywood wanted to send a message!<br/><br/>Why not use the name Hitler since Hitler was a soldier in WW1 just like Ludendorff ! In fact General Ludendorff joined the NAZI party and helped Hitler get into power in Germany. The Israeli Gal Gadot kills this future NAZI general in the movie, see where this goes ? The movie if full of symbolism and metaphors! <br/><br/>A superhero movie should be placed in a SF universe, like Batman's city, not in actual human history where it changes it for the benefit of the American propaganda machine that Hollywood is !<br/><br/>And we did not even talk about the FEMINIST message in this movie, that's a totally different story.<br/><br/>The movie is Directed by a woman and is intended to be a big FEMINIST propaganda shock story aimed at teenagers. The feminist propaganda did not start today but now Hollywood makes FEMINIST movies on a scale not seen before. <br/><br/>There are many new feminist characters being prepared in their propaganda laboratories. In 2017 you have 'Proud Mary' which is a FEMINIST movies for black women, then there is 'Atomic Blonde' for white women. Last year we had 'Ghostbusters' with women and so many others. Over the years there were countless feminist movies in which women played Rambo style characters: Salt, Resident Evil, Electra, Tomb Raider etc yet somehow a lot of people discover the woman superhero just today! Really ?<br/><br/>It's like there is a contest with men, even if it looks unreal Hollywood wants to portray women capable of the same physical capabilities as men even though everybody knows this is not possible since normal women are not physically as strong as men<br/><br/>Mr & Mrs Smith was a feminist movie since the woman in that movie was meant to be as strong and capable as the man but at least we could enjoy that one because the acting was good and the script was OK, in Wonder Woman the script and the acting are garbage<br/><br/>Wonder Woman (2016) is a disaster of a movie but a great tool for the army of feminist propagandists out there"

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Diana (Gal Gadot) was raised on a distant planet of only women, where her mother wanted to protect her from the physical demands of fighting like all the other women there. But one day she starts to rebel and unleashes some hidden powers she was unaware of, meaning the rite of passage has come, so her mother tells her the story of a spiteful son of a God and his attempt to destroy the Earth. Then, Air Force pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands into their home, confusing the order of things. He reveals he has a book that contains plans by evil German commandant Ludendorff (Danny Huston) to unleash a deadly nerve gas on England. And so Diana and Steve must head to London to thwart his diabolical plan.<br/><br/>The superhero franchise, on both sides of the DC/Marvel divide, must really be doing the rounds, as now we have Wonder Woman, who was a character in the recent disastrous Batman Vs. Superman movie, in her own more than feature length film. And after this, there is of course the Justice League film, where all the main players are having a big jamboree together. Whether this was the inspiration behind this films existence or pressure from the feminist movement to get some good ol' equality up there on the big screen is unclear, but either way the debut feature length directorial effort of Patty Jenkins is a long, joyless effort that wastes a golden chance to level the playing field for female superheroes.<br/><br/>Like Batman, even more so, in fact, Wonder Woman has been taken from a pretty camp, light hearted source, and been transformed into something far moodier and deep on the big screen, where undemanding fun has been substituted for wondrous spectacle. But for all the awe inspiring effects and breath taking action sequences, it can't make up for a total sense of humour failure in the script, as well as any care-worthy characters or snappy dialogue, as well as a totally sloppy, incoherent plot that really fails to suck you in for the length it does. She may be beautiful and glamorous to look at, but Gadot isn't the greatest actress, to say the least, and co star Pine is equally vapid and bland. Even a support cast including David Thewlis, Ewen Bremner and Lucy Davis can't help. Performances wise, the best thing is Huston as the villain, who really fits the skin of his character, but can't make the whole thing taste any better.<br/><br/>It would have been great to see a good Wonder Woman, but sadly this is just Blunder Woman! *"

"ReelLifeReviews","9","147","341","2 June 2017"," Best of the new DC by far
","Wonder Woman - Saying that this is the best of the new DC films isn't exactly glowing praise. Saying that it now currently holds my highest score of the year, however, would definitely qualify.<br/><br/>The dramatic and comedic tones were perfectly balanced. Such a glaring omission from the previous DC offerings was any real feeling of levity. Here, jokes were well timed and delivered even better. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine's chemistry was automatic, making these back-and-forths all the more believable. And Lucy Davis steals the show as Pine's secretary.<br/><br/>There is something to be said for the theme song of this movie. Do me a favor and try to hum the theme to the Avengers. How about Captain America? The most recent Spiderman, maybe? I might not be able to pick any of those out of a lineup. Wonder Woman's theme is visceral and will be immediately recognizable after you've heard it. It's featured in key moments of the film, adding to the weight of the already powerful action.<br/><br/>Similar to most of the Marvel films, this one has a weak villain. A German officer is presented as the antagonist, but I felt more like it was just war in general that they were fighting against. I definitely liked the payoff, but he was underwhelming as an adversary.<br/><br/>The only other negative I can think of is that there are some moments of wonky special effects. It took me back to The Matrix Reloaded where Neo is just a computer animated cartoon knocking around a dozen Agent Smiths with a stick. The effects seemed jarringly dated at times.<br/><br/>DC was in an absolute tailspin up to this point. The last three films received critic ratings of 55%, 27%, and 25%. This could have been the nail in the coffin. Instead, it was an absolute B12 shot to the brand and the studio itself. Box office hauls of future DC films will no doubt be bigger because of this movie. And to think I almost stayed away from this one based on Batman v Superman alone. Now, Wonder Woman is the only reason I'll keep DC in my lineup going forward. 8.75/10."

"jmarinko925","9","165","388","2 June 2017"," A Beautiful,Thrilling Portrayal of this Icon! Most enjoyable!
","Last evening I saw Wonder Woman and it met and exceeded my expectations marvelously! Gal Gadot shines on screen as the Amazon Princess with an excellent supporting cast(The chemistry between her and co lead Chris Pine is wonderful!). You could very easily enjoy this film without seeing any of the previous films or will realize it as the best of it's franchise to date! Have no fear that this will be boring because of the period the film takes place in,it matters not. Creators of the film benefit greatly by staying true to the source material that has encapsulated audiences since Diana Prince's debut in comics over seven decades ago. As well as DC comic's own Geoff Johns joining the production team! Wonder Woman is done justice as she serves Justice by the amazing combat Sequences shot by Director Patty Jenkins and the score compliments the screen accordingly!<br/><br/>I don't need humor in a film about a hero , nor do enjoy it when it's forced into a story. The humor in Wonder Woman is well placed and most called for and appreciated. The same goes for the action in this film it is not overdone nor is it to much or to little it is just right. . This movie benefits from an exciting story, heroic characters that are enjoyable and most credible vile villains. I want to see it again and can't wait to see Wonder Woman in Justice League this November!"
"RforFilm","10","59","128","6 June 2017"," Like the real Wonder Woman that was sculpted in clay, the movie is god-like is how fantastic it is in every field.
","When it comes to women superheroes, it seems that they have more of a prominence within comics rather then their film adaptations. A lot of that has to do with that there are simply more men then women that even wear the capes, as it seemed that the image of the comic book seemed more like a boys thing. Of course that's far from the truth as not only plenty women read comic books, but comics themselves have proved that they can be an art. So for each Spider-Man, Batman, and Iron Man, where are the women heroes like Captain Marvel, Batgirl, and of course, Wonder Woman? <br/><br/>Like how comics had to prove that there's room for heroes of all genders, film had to do something similar. It's too bad we couldn't have started with both men and women, but that's just how society is. Previous attempts to portray women as superheroes have fallen short with awful movies like Supergirl, Catwoman, and Elektra. It's hard to pinpoint where those went wrong, bit I think it was a matter of trying to be too different from the regular superheroes. Everyone can rest easy as Wonder Woman not only gives us a good DC movie, but a great woman-led superhero film.<br/><br/>On the hidden island of Themyscira, which is home to the Amazon women, young Diana is the daughter to Queen Hippolyta (played by Connie Nielsen) and Zeus when she was sculpted out of clay. Diana would like to train to be a fierce warrior, though her mother refuses it. This leads Diana to be secretly trained by her aunt and General of the Amazons, Antlope (played by Robin Wright). Things seem fine as Diana (played by Gal Gadot) proves to be quick on her feet and strong, until a planes crashes near their waters.<br/><br/>Diana rescues the pilot Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine) who turns out to be a captain from the United States Army Air Service in the crisis of ""The War to End All Wars"". Steve convinces Diana that the Amazon women would be in great danger while Diana starts to think that that it's all the cause of the god of war, Ares. Knowing she can handle the ""God-Killer"" sword, she accompanies Steve to England to find out where Ares would be during the Great War. Meanwhile, the Germans are working on more methods to fight forward with the help of General Ludendorff and the mad scientist Dr. Poison.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman has figured out why the previous female led superhero movies have failed and why the others work; because they care. It's clear that director Patty Jenkins understands that you don't need to try something too different, but rather fresh. Wonder Woman uses a familiar setup of a ""team up plot to defeat the villain"", but it has a radical feel to it all because you can tell that the people behind this care about their character. Much of the dark tone from Man of Steel and Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice is gone in favor of something more lively (though it does have grim moments).<br/><br/>One of the stronger points of Batman V Superman was Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. This movie shows she's a good enough actress to carry herself throughout. What makes it smart that aside from being a fish out of water scenario for our hero, the Chris Pine character has one too on the island of the Amazons. This allows a reintroduction to Wonder Woman as she starts to understand the humans and how some of their actions may not come from the gods. It's a true character arc that not even Marvel seems to be doing a lot of.<br/><br/>What I also like is that it's never trying to push the ""women rule!"" feel (similar to the Ghostbusters from last year) that hard in favor of a ""men and women working together"" tone that seems like something that everyone will like. Her willingness to want to save everyone while accepting that many of victims of circumstance not only having me feel good about our heroine, but even had me think about some of the flaws of the original Captain America movie that had a ""good vs. evil"" style war.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten lassos of truth out of ten. Wonder Woman is not only the best DC cinematic universe movie, but feels like a fresh breath of air within the superhero bubble that only seems to be getting bigger. It works as an action movie, a comedy, a movie about World War I, a drama, and above all, a great superhero story about ones evolution. It only seems like that this was sculpted by the same gods who made Diana."

"madbhoot","9","141","329","1 June 2017"," Wonder Woman: Best DC Movie after the Batman Trilogy!
","Just watched the first show and everybody started clapping when the credit started to roll in the end. That says a lot about a movie.<br/><br/>Many of us had doubt when Gal Gadot was cast as Wonder Woman, and she proved the worth. What an amazing cast! Hollywood is full of beautiful actresses, but Gal also has a great personality which resonates with her character very well. She is strong as well as funny. Chris Pine turned out to be the perfect sidekick and love interest of Diana. He has this old classic Hollywood look. I am hoping we will see more of Connie Nelson and Robin Wright's character in the next venture. <br/><br/>I don't want to go further into screenplay. It has its tiny flaws, but we have seen much worse in recent times. Many people might argue why the WWI? Well, the core of the movie is not the war, but the darkness inside us that causes the war. You can easily relate it to today's narrative. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie through and through. Finally a quality superhero movie from DC after Batman Trilogy. You go Gal!"
"RLTerry1","9","117","271","2 June 2017"," Exceptional. Outstanding. DC Hits a Homer! FINALLY.
","WONDERful! No seriously, this is an excellent film! And I'm just not talking about the superhero genre. DC finally hit a homer with this one. This film also serves as evidence that Zack Snyder can WRITE a great story but should probably stay out of the director's chair. Warner Bros. and Ratpac Dune's Wonder Woman is the superhero film we needed. Trailing so far behind the Marvel brand and film quality, DC needed to produce a film that would make up for Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad AND catch up to Marvel. Seemingly setting out to accomplish the impossible, this film exceeded all measurable expectations and provided a comprehensive cinematic experience. With many themes, this film hits on many topics and does so with incredible precision and elegance. It's almost as if this film is an extension of Diana Prince herself. Never addressed or referenced as Wonder Woman actually, Diana Prince's origin story is powerful and ever so apropos in today's socio-political climate. If only we could all have the courage, compassion, and determination that Wonder Woman embodies and represents. <br/><br/>Ever since her creation in 1941 by psychologist William Marston, Wonder Woman has always been treated the best when all pre-existing inhibitions typically added to a female character in a ""man's"" role are removed, allowing the feminist ethos at her core to shine and erupt with unbridled passion and strength. Among other traits, the chief characteristic that separates her from other superheroes in both the Marvel and DC universes respectively is--no, not her gender--it is her ability to integrate truth, justice, compassion, and courage in everything she does to protect the planet entrusted to her people by the Greek gods. The key to understanding Wonder Woman is not through her brute strength or supernatural powers, but through her love and compassion for innocent people and her own integrity. Rarely has any film truly given women (or anyone, for the matter) a strong female protagonist who does not pander but exhibits excellence in well-developed strength of character and a complete eruption of the fantasies of many women to rise up to serve and protect. It would have been far too easy to sell Diana Prince as a vengeful women out to destroy men or seek revenge for the destruction that has befallen the planet; but no, that is not the Diana we see. We see a heroine of others--a completely unselfish hero who is of earth. Being of the earth is truly what separates her from someone like Super Man. Sure, some strong female characters from with the world of comics, literature, theatre, TV, or film have demonstrated strong characteristics and have been leaders; but Wonder Woman sands alone as a film that provides audiences with a female protagonist who is not merely a leader, but the engineer--the author--of her own destiny and story.<br/><br/>Why does this film work so well??? After all, that is the question you are likely asking yourself after so many DC flops (note: that does not count the Burton or Nolan films). The short answer is that Snyder was NOT in the driver's seat on this ride; however, there is more to it than that. Snyder's touch is certainly evident in many scenes (especially the action sequences); furthermore, he was greatly instrumental in the overall structure, but he took a backseat to the driver of this vehicle. His approach was important in the design of the car, and even building it, but when it came time to take it for a spin, he turned the steering wheel over to Director Patty Jenkins. Films featuring strong female protagonists most often seem to fair better when there is a women at the helm. And Wonder Woman is a testament to that observation. Whereas a male director would have likely spent some time sexualizing Diana, Jenkins spends the time on her courage and compassion. Instead of focusing on the terrain of Diana's mystical home beautifully appointed with white cliffs and sapphire water or spending time on her sleek blade or even her trademark lasso of truth, Jenkins spends a significant amount of screen time on the terrain of Diana's face. A face that communicates the heart, mind, and soul of Diana. Instead of a face displaying anger or disgust at the world of men, her face is often bright, hopeful, containing a winning smile with eyes overflowing with optimism. In terms of the production design itself, it only bares hints of Snyder's penchant for beautiful music videos; the production design is one that takes itself seriously, but in the perfect amounts. Although the film is quite dark, there are sufficient moments of levity.<br/><br/>Perhaps you're a stereotypical dude who does not care for films that feature female protagonists and feministic themes. No fear. Wonder Woman is actually a World War I film disguised as a superhero movie. As much as Wonder Woman works as an exceptional superhero movie, it is equally an impressive World War I film. Taking place in the days leading up to Armistice Day, this film displays the atrocities of war and the determination of both sides to win. You will find yourself in the trenches in France and Belgium with the Allied forces who, against all odds, are determined to defeat the enemy in order to stop genocide and widespread devastation. Placing Wonder Woman amidst the warriors of earth, connects her to humanity in ways that most superheroes cannot. Fighting for what you believe in is a major theme in this film. Some of the best war movies are those that ""show don't tell."" And Wonder Woman certainly shows what war really looks like instead of talking about it as some abstract concept or spending time in diplomacy. In fact, diplomacy is thrown out the window, and Diana lays the need to fight on the hearts of the bureaucratic leaders and soldiers alike. Pick up your sword and fight. Don't just sit idly by while humanity is destroyed."
"rgkarim","9","125","291","1 June 2017"," Wander Over To Wonder!
","It's a brand-new month and you know what that means right? Yes, another super hero movie to kick off the summer blockbuster season. This time it isn't Marvel cranking out the comic book, cinematic feature, but their rivals DC studios. With its recent shaky track record, the DC cinematic universe hasn't gotten the best publicity in terms of quality. So, the studio has decided to get the leading lady herself to pave the way. Yes, today's review is on Wonder Woman starring Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. Can this movie break the bad luck streak of DC/WB studios? Robbie K here to share some opinions on the matter, so let's get started, shall we?<br/><br/>LIKES<br/><br/>1. Gal Gadot is incredible and steals the show with her poise, pizazz, and acting talents. A fantastic casting direction that really brings the woman to wonder to life in beauty, ferocity, and bouts of heroism (a.k.a. kicking bad guy butt). Acting, stunts, and an on-point delivery of her lines makes this actress one of the tops in my book!<br/><br/>2. The action is on point (for most of the movie) filled with impressive displays of weaponry, martial arts, and historical warfare. Wonder Woman's battles held such emotion, managing to bring the suspense all while delivering that feel good, post battle high, you might have gotten from reading a comic book. The team brings some fast-paced thrills we have wanted for almost a year and a half.<br/><br/>3. A good representation for girls. I may have already said this, but this movie targets a wide variety of audience members in some form or manner. Yet this reviewer has to give props for the design of a character that is certainly worthy of representing the female super heroes and inspiring the female population that they certainly can do anything. <br/><br/>4. Comedic timing: It's not going to be a super hero movie (at least in this day and age) without some laughs to break up the tension. Wonder Woman continues this trend, filling the void with well-timed one-liners, a few awkward encounters that often deal with sex, and some slap-stick gimmicks that do the job well. <br/><br/>5. Character Development: I know most super hero movies have this element, but there is something about Wonder Woman that stood out to me. This film managed to spin Diana's character development into a roller coaster ride of feelings that almost made me tear up. Her journey to discovering herself and her role into this new world was poetically portrayed, using multiple angles to get the job done. It could have also been due to the powerful soundtrack, the visual effects, or maybe Gadot's acting, but it really worked for me. <br/><br/>6. Fast Pace: We all know those movies that drag (and yes, I'm talking much of DC's library). Not the case for this film. The nearly 150-minute run time flew by for much of the movie having me at one point saying, ""Dang, it's already been 90 minutes."" Not something I often say. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>1. Unoriginality: You'll find that Wonder Woman shares a lot with Captain America: First Avenger. The set-up, setting, and build up almost matching outside of the weapon of choice and martial arts moves. Certainly, not the biggest limitation, but something that others have been bothered by. <br/><br/>2. Almost pointless crew: The crew that joins Diana held such promise in the picture, but it was dropped so hard in this movie. Outside of Chris Pine, the other members do little for the overall mission outside of a few throws, some ""tracking"" and mainly comedic relief. There were hints at character development and deeper dynamics, but they fizzled out faster than sparkler at 4th of July. I know, this movie is about Wonder Woman, but why even include these guys if that was the goal. <br/><br/>3. Preachy: Some reviews state the whole feminism/males are pigs is overdone, and to an extent I agree. Yet the bigger dislike was the preachy monologues that sometimes plagued this film. A few times the heat of the moment was lost in a display of self-reflection, which is great, but not in the midst of a battlefield. Some of these moments also had that eye-rolling factor for me. <br/><br/>4. Overuse of CGI: I like special effects, I like stunts, but I don't like overuse of a gimmick. The slow-motion interludes during the action scenes added some cool emphasis to Wonder Woman's skills (alongside some cool finishing moves). Somewhere along the production, someone got a little trigger happy with the effect and used a little too much for me, and soon started disrupting the cool stunts they had Gal do. In addition, there were some special effects that were a bit cheesy and took the edge off of Wonder Woman. Learn from Michael Bay people, too much of special effects makes for many jokes. <br/><br/>5. The ending: Don't turn away, hear me out. The ending is great on many levels (emotional, prowess, role model, and morals). However, it lost the momentum the first few fights had with them, trading suspense for flashy special effects, drawn out banter, and unimpressive choreography. Sort of felt like the ending to X-men apocalypse where the bad guys bark was worse than his bite. <br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>Wonder Woman delivers on many levels and breaks the mediocre displays that DC has cranked out over the last year. It's emotional, it's dynamic, it's fun, and it provides a solid role model for admirable heroes. I feel the movie met most of my expectations and I was happy with the overall product. It's far from perfect though, and still has a few things to tighten up (like developing other characters, balancing the CGI use, and keeping the momentum going). Still, I have to recommend this one for a theater visit, especially you comic lovers out there."
"anupapu8","9","68","151","10 June 2017"," Woman Of Steel
","WONDER WOMAN - I don't know much about Wonder Woman comics. But i know that Superman comics are based on two themes. HOPE and BELIEVE IN HUMANITY. Patty Jenkins as a director took these two themes from Superman and made a Wonder Woman movie or i can say Woman Of Steel.<br/><br/>This is basically a FISH OUT OF THE WATER storyline. The movie shows how Wonder Woman deal with the new world about which she don't know much while trying to stop World War 1. This is by far the simplest story of DCEU. Simpler then MAN OF STEEL and DAWN OF JUSTICE. M not counting Suicide Squad because i don't see much of a story in that film. But being simple is not a bad thing. In fact its great as long as origin stories goes. <br/><br/>M glade that Themyscira the birth place of WW is given enough time to explore. Which brings me to the cinematography. From Themyscira(which has been shot in South Wales and looked gorgeous) to England to Berlin , everything looked beautiful in this movie. And the 3d is better then THE MUMMY , although i still recommend to watch it in 2d. <br/><br/>Jokes were an integral part of the story. All of them are because of the lack of knowledge of WW about the outer world.And these jokes makes the character of WW a little bit of Naive and whole lot sweeter . Some of the jokes also goes little out of the line as long as preferability of Kids goes,<br/><br/>I have to say i am very happy with the action sequences of the movie. True that every movie cant achieve the level of Matrix , Man Of Steel and Mad Max , but WW came pretty close. And i liked all of them. Specially the climax one. Which was too close to the climax of Dawn Of Justice , but Patty here injected some serious emotional moments of WW having the self realization , which made the action scene better. <br/><br/>Cant go forward without talking about the scores. The whole movie has been ''VIOLINISED''. I know that not exactly a real word but i still used it. And yes the WW theme , came out 3-4 times . And its awesome. Could have been used even more. <br/><br/>Gal Gadot is exceptional. On a level that there has been some Oscar talks running around. She well managed the Boldness and Naiveness of the character nicely. And set a benchmark in action scenes for female super heroes. <br/><br/>Chris Pinn , called as box office poison(a star who makes flops despite good acting.) is giving here one of his best performance , and yes the movie is working very well at box office and some credit goes to him. <br/><br/>What else to say , m happy as well as relieved to see that the movie is good. I was hoping too much from it and it paid of. <br/><br/>8.8/10<br/><br/>by ANuP APu KuMaR"
"trinaboice","9","70","156","6 June 2017"," WONDERful
","Grade: A-<br/><br/>Rating: PG-13, 141 minutes<br/><br/>In a Nutshell: I used to watch Wonder Woman on TV back when I was a little girl. I loved it. I thought she was beautiful, kind, and strong. As a little girl, it made me feel like I could do almost anything. Yep, this superhero movie is about female empowerment, but it has a lot more than that.<br/><br/>I don't know why it has taken this long to bring Wonder Woman to the Big Screen. Maybe we were waiting for the perfect Gal Gadot.<br/><br/>This fun action flick has just the right amount of humor and Justice League magic. Warner Brothers gives us an extremely entertaining summer popcorn blockbuster that gives Marvel a run for its money. It's part of a set up for Justice League and a planned trilogy for Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Uplifting theme: ""If you see something wrong happening in the word, you can either do nothing or you can do something."" - Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) ""What one does, when faced with the truth, is more difficult than you would think."" – Diana/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) ""It is our sacred duty to defend the world."" – Diana/Wonder Woman ""Everyone is fighting their own battles, Diana, just as you're fighting yours."" - Sameer ""A promise is unbreakable."" - Diana ""Only love can truly save the world."" - Diana Love vs. hate, peace vs. war, humanity<br/><br/>Things I liked: Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are both gorgeous and awesome. As Chris Pine's character explains, ""I am above average."" Gal Gadot has the perfect accent to sound exotic. As Sameer says about her, ""OMG, that is a work of art."" Eye candy for everyone. Great female stunt work. Some cool and fun slow-motion, as well as sped-up action sequences. Female director Patty Jenkins was going to film Wonder Woman back in 2005, but she became pregnant and the project was put on hold. She said she was thrilled to be able to pick up the project again, because it was the movie she had been wanting to make her whole life. She's the first woman to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist. We haven't seen a female superhero since Electra in 2005. It's about time, right? Most of the CGI is very good, although it becomes a bit heavy towards the end. Gal Gadot was actually 5 months pregnant during some of the filming, so they put green screen on her belly so they could remove the baby bump during post-production. I love it when the directors and producers put themselves in small cameo performances in their own films. In this case, producer Zack Snyder shows up as a World War I soldier. Did you know this movie has been banned in Lebanon? Gal Gadot is Israeli and even served in the military. Ah, romance. I love that both Diana and Steve learn from each other and make one another better. I wish I had one of those truth lassos. It was cool to see the symbolism of light and color illustrated in man's world and that of Themyscera. The soundtrack was noticeably good.<br/><br/>Things I didn't like: There are a couple of long, explanatory scenes to help you understand what's going on. I wish Lynda Carter, the first TV Wonder Woman, could have made a cameo performance. Apparently, she sings in cabarets and couldn't fit it into her schedule. She definitely should have made the time for her fans. The villain was pretty weak.<br/><br/>Interesting lines: ""You let this little thing tell you what to do?"" – Diana/Wonder Woman talking about Chris Pine's watch. ""You know that if you choose to leave, you may never return."" – Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) ""Who would I be if I stayed?"" – Diana ""What kind of weapon kills innocents?"" – Diana ""In this war, every kind."" – Steve Trevor * ""I believe in love."" - Diana<br/><br/>Funny lines: ""How could a woman ever possibly fight in this?"" – Diana ""Fight? We use our principles. Although, I'm not opposed to using fisty cuffs, should the need arise."" – Etta (Lucy Davis) ""Please put down the sword."" – Steve ""It doesn't go with the outfit."" – Etta ""Welcome to jolly 'ole London!"" – Steve ""It's hideous!"" – Diana ""Yeah, it's not for everyone."" – Steve ""You're a man."" – Diana ""Yeah. I mean, don't I look like one?"" – Steve ""Stand back! Or maybe not."" – Steve ""I'm both frightened and aroused."" – Sameer (Said Taghmaoui) ""You should be very proud!"" – Diana after she tastes a vendor's ice cream. I feel that way about great ice cream too. ""May we get what we want. May we get what we need. But may we never get what we deserve."" - men's toast at campfire<br/><br/>Tips for parents: <br/><br/>You see a LOT of Chris Pinebare naked after a bath while he covers his junk with his hands. Lots of violence, destruction, and explosions. At 141 minutes, it's a long movie that a lot of little ones won't be able to sit through. In the comics, the war is WWII, but the director chose to highlight WWI in the movie. Parents might need to explain the differences between those two wars."

","Wow Wonder Woman just blew me away. The casting was great especially Gal Gadot, Cris Pine, Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen. And also, the decision to use WW1 backdrop and how well it was portrayed was just perfect.<br/><br/>The movie has a raw feel to it which makes it extra special. Not a moment will go by where you'll think they tried too hard to fit in the humor, it all comes as natural as natural can be. There is a lot of little moments in the movie that can be appreciated like for example the dancing in midst of war, the romance between Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor. Moreover, the action alone can be a driving factor, which makes me want to watch this movie again and again. Its one like, that we've never seen before.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is not perfect, it has few, a few CGI issues which I think all big action movies have in common (including Marvel movies as well), however, with Wonder Woman its handled really well.<br/><br/>I honestly appreciate the hard work and passion that went behind making this movie possible. Some of the people to credit will be Petty Jenkins (wonderful director), Zack Snyder (for having good vision for these movies) and the screen writers. Wonder Woman is a ""mustsee"" movie on big screens."

","Cue that awesome theme music! Gal Gadot plays Diana, Princess of Themyscira, and daughter of Hippolyta. Best known as Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>And by god she kills it in this. Wonder Woman is not merely the best installment of the DCEU so far but it's probably the best DC movie since the Dark Knight trilogy. Wonder Woman is also one of the most entertaining superhero debuts since the first Guardians of the Galaxy. On top of that, there is finally an excellent movie to set the benchmark for future superhero movies about a female hero.<br/><br/>Director Patty Jenkins transports audiences to Paradise Island where Amazon warrior women are tasked to defend mankind from the vengeful Ares, the Greek god of war. Their ruler's daughter Diana is kindhearted, brave, compassionate, and courageous. She rescues a dashing spy named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) who informs her people about a greater conflict we know to be World War One. She is appalled by the destruction and onslaught so without question she sets out on a quest to end it.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is the beautiful beating heart of this movie and perfectly cast as Wonder Woman. She's charismatic and authoritative but not so much that she loses her feminine charm and sense of humor. Yes a DC character being funny! Imagine that! Chris Pine is the love interest/sidekick who could honestly serve as the lead of his own adventure movie. Pine is factory built for these types of tough but clever action roles. His chemistry with Gadot is the best romance in a superhero movie since probably the original Spider-Man movies. The supporting cast is a strong one. Connie Nielsen is dignified as the Queen, Robin Wright is her steely lieutenant, Danny Huston is a slimy Nazi-by-another-name, Elena Anaya is her creepy henchwoman, and Lucy Davis plays the comic relief.<br/><br/>The movie uses the wartime setting to its advantage. No Man's Land becomes Diana Prince's debut as Wonder Woman. German infantry fight Amazons on horseback. Later the finale boils down to a god versus another god. And yes they use the Lasso of Truth. It's so cool! The timing of this movie couldn't be better. It works splendidly as a summer blockbuster at the very least. But it gives hope to female viewers young and old that women can be heroes too. It gives male viewers a chance to see a true ideal feminist hero in action. It also redresses for the mistakes made in the previous installments of the DCEU and honestly makes me more excited for Justice League"

","I knew this movie would be impressive and would break everything and I couldn't be more happier then watching the movie and witnessing that I was right.<br/><br/>The cast was formidable, they couldn't pick a more perfect actress than Gal Gadot, her portrayal as Wonder Woman was a massive hit, I felt her joy, I even smiled when she smiled, I felt her lost, yes, it was hard saying goodbye to a great character like Steve, and the emotions Gal Gadot expressed by her loss was so heartbreaking and believable. I loved to know the origins of Diana Prince, it was amazing to see how fearless and persistent she was from such a little age.<br/><br/>I couldn't not be more happier for the success of Wonder Woman, since this movie deserve it's recognition and value, and congrats to Patty Jenkins because she was the right person to bring this masterpiece life and put the DCEU in the right path."
"ElDiomedes","7","30","61","1 June 2017"," Very linear, DC got it right, a female strong hero on the spotlight, she's Wonder Woman
","Reading the reviews here. Either they are bowing down to the movie or just hating blindly. Not sure how many have actually seen it. Very good movie after all the disappointment from the past DCEU movies.<br/><br/>Seeing all the trailers and featurettes, very little was left for imagination, but those didn't disappoint. The movie is about the journey of a demigod from Themyscira, where it's all bright and shiny to the real world, which is torn by war, greed, hatred and darkness. Diana walks in as the light.<br/><br/>Getting her influence from Donner, Patty Jenkins got it right. What it means to be a hero, what does it mean to inspire..and the quest for the Amazon beauty to become the light in the darkness. Strength, sorrow, motivation, humanity, hope and loss forges the path to be the ultimate hero she's meant to be.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot surprised me. Most of her past performances were, well, sub par. Finally she's in the spotlight. She did pretty well. Although she has a long way to go, everyone begins somewhere. This movie is for her. Kudos for her strong performance, specially the fight sequences.<br/><br/>We all deserved this movie. While not a masterpiece, but good enough to be the stepping stone for women empowerment, and a proper story for a demigod and one of the most popular female superhero who can go toe to toe with the all powerful Superman. I just can't wait to see her interactions and chemistry with the big blue, and how they co ordinate, being the two gods that they are. DCEU is back on track.<br/><br/>Apart from her, Chris Pine as Steve Trevor shined, and he is straight from the comic book pages. He's a good actor, not surprising.<br/><br/>Despite all the positives, it has it's flaws. Some scenes were too long and unnecessarily dragged. Diana's chemistry with Steve could have been better. Dr Poison was equivalent to Kaecilius' henchmen..wasted.<br/><br/>A good ending satisfies all, after the emotional turbulence audiences go through. This movie did justice to that.<br/><br/>That being said, Man of Steel still remains the favorite DCEU movie for me. But perhaps that's because I'm biased to Supes.<br/><br/>7/10."

","When you consider the context of both the DCEU's struggles and women trying to get their footing as filmmakers, this three-act joyride of a spectacle moves and shakes in a way we've never seen. Gadot is as charismatic as they come, and simply thinking about her chemistry with Chris Pine makes me well with happy tears.<br/><br/>It's a superhero origin story, plain and simple, and may be the best one since the likes of Batman Begins and Ironman. It doesn't introduce groundbreaking methods of filmmaking and art, and it doesn't have to.<br/><br/>It starts with Diana receiving the famed picture Lex Luthor had stolen from her in Batman V Superman. Despite the DCEU's controversial library, I LOVE that the films are so closely connected like this. The picture includes a friendly note from Bruce Wayne as she flashes back to the tale we are told, starting with her childhood on Themiscyra and ending with her defeat of a disguised Ares to turn the tide in WWI.<br/><br/>The story is beautifully told and, for lack of a better word, simple. It's simply marvellous. Gadot nails the innocence of being a pure-hearted demigoddess first setting foot in a war-ravaged, early 20th century world. Chris Pine is his usual emotional, charming self who does everything he can to help her while inevitably falling in love with her. As she realizes her power (the 'No Man's Land' scene is one of the G.O.A.T. and you can't convince me otherwise), we see Diana harden into a determined, confident, and terrifying force of nature.<br/><br/>Ares' true identity is a huge twist. I want to say it was predictable but it caught me off-guard in the theater. Either way, it fits and it works.<br/><br/>The action sequences are incredible. Diana slams her bracelets together while training to show a glimpse of her true Power, which finally provokes her aunt and mother into revealing her true identity as the daughter of Zeus himself. She saves Chris Pine more than once as she blasts her way through muddy, death-drenched battlefield with nothing more than a sword and shield. Finally, in a moment of sacrifice, she has a 'Super Saiyan' moment where she is unable to hold back any longer and finally defeats Ares in imagery very similar to millennia of depictions of her father. <br/><br/>I simply don't know how this story could have been told any better. In a way, its structure is an homage to the ancient Greek texts its lore derives from. People who rag on this film are looking for reasons to not be entertained and have missed the point: DC finally got it right, and the world finally has a female hero in one of the best superhero flicks to date."
"Mr-Fusion","8","71","160","20 June 2017"," DC finds its footing
","There's a lot that went into ""Wonder Woman""; it's partially a romantic comedy, coming-of-age story, period action/superhero movie, but maybe above all, a love story. Diana Prince gears up ultimately out of love - which doesn't sound like something that'd fit very well in a war movie. Part of the reason this movie is so good is that it had big boots to fill. The DC movies haven't been stellar up to this point, and their inherent dreariness hasn't helped matters. And here's a movie with competent direction, gorgeous visuals and a lead actress that's fully up to the challenge. Gal Gadot instills in her character honor, innocence, and the necessary color to really bring a comic book movie to the screen.<br/><br/>In other words, it's everything I was hoping for in a Wonder Woman film. It doesn't feel like it was ground out of a sausage factory, and really manages to do everything right. Just to give context, this is coming from a guy who's pretty burnt out on the genre. <br/><br/>I loved this movie.<br/><br/>8/10"

There are cracks in this movie and they show. But to me, a 10/10 isn't a ""perfect"" movie. It's one that is not only well made, but also so impressive and so emotionally affecting that it makes the flaws irrelevant. I LOVE this movie. Its acting, its direction, its effects, its story and dialogue, everything. And in this case, it made me feel amazing. It reached inside of me and made my heart feel warm and strong.

"Ramascreen","10","43","92","31 May 2017"," This is Wonder Woman in all her glory
","#WonderWoman movie is simply amazing. It doesn't hold back, it pulls out all the stops, it doesn't reserve some parts for a potential sequel, it fully gives you this iconic Amazonian Warrior princess in all her glory. You'll be constantly blown away by what she can do because the film is constantly eager to show them to you. Gal Gadot has cemented her star power and the DC Cinematic Universe has redeemed themselves through ""Wonder Woman.""<br/><br/>Starring Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Connie Nielsen, David Thewlis, directed by Patty Jenkins, before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons trained to be an unconquerable warrior in the mythical island of Themyscira. But Diana is unaware of her true identity. When an American pilot crashes on their shores and tells of a massive war raging in the outside world, Diana feels compelled to join him and fight alongside mankind to stop the threat and kill who she blames to be the cause of such destruction, the god of war Ares.<br/><br/>Because it's a DC movie, much of the visual and the style of ""Wonder Woman"" is what you'd expect from a DC movie. But what's great about this one, which by the way the other installments unfortunately failed to do, is that ""Wonder Woman"" manages to inject entertainment, so it's not all brooding and dark and depressing like the way they've turned boyscout Superman into.<br/><br/>And I think much of that is thanks to the fish-out-of-water aspect. This is a woman who comes from a place which has a significantly different culture than ours. And halfway through the end, the fish-out-of-water aspect becomes less about literally not fitting in and more about her misunderstood perception of us, mankind. So perhaps ""Wonder Woman"" is an example of a success story that happens when you don't give all the control to Zack Snyder and when studio heads don't meddle with the mythology and the filmmaker's vision and when things are not forced or rushed. The result is a story which you can tell has been given a considerable amount of thought process.<br/><br/>Any doubt anybody may have had about Gal Gadot playing this role will fade away the minute she steps into the screen. Not only does she look the part, she's absolutely gorgeous, her acting is sharp, she also performs the action sequences with strength and elegance. She becomes Wonder Woman, they are now inseparable, just like we're all going to have a hard time imagining somebody else other than Hugh Jackman as Wolverine/Logan. This is Wonder Woman's debut on the big screen, billions of girls and women on earth look up to her as their hero, they have been anticipating this moment for years, so it is a huge responsibility, one that I think Gadot gracefully carries. Kudos to WB and DC Entertainment for entrusting this to female filmmaker Patty Jenkins who does an excellent job because more than just it being a great superhero film, ""Wonder Woman"" is a very well-made film. It's spectacular in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>-- Rama's Screen --"
"MrDHWong","9","52","114","1 June 2017"," Exactly the type of movie that the DC Universe has needed for some time
","Wonder Woman is a superhero film starring Gal Gadot in the title role and the fourth installment in the DC Extended Universe. Directed by Patty Jenkins (2003's Monster), the film not only redeems the DC Universe of some of its previous missteps, but also breathes some new life into the superhero franchise as a whole.<br/><br/>In 1918, the Amazonian princess Diana (Gal Gadot) trains with her fellow warrior sisters on the isolated island nation of Themyscira. One day, an American pilot named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands near the island. After being rescued by Diana, Steve tells her and the other Amazonians of the outside world and of a ""war to end all wars"" currently being waged by the human race. Refusing to allow the death and carnage to continue, Diana decides to leave with Steve and fight alongside him to hopefully put a stop to the evil people responsible for this war.<br/><br/>Featuring a well paced plot and some creatively choreographed action scenes, Wonder Woman is exactly the type of movie that the DC Universe has needed for some time, considering some of the poor creative decisions that were made in its three predecessors. There was also a good balance of humour scattered throughout the story, very much in the vein of some Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, but never so much that it feels forced and tacked on at the last minute. Gal Gadot's performance in the eponymous role is great, her acting range has improved significantly since Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. My only real complaint is that the film does follow a typical ""superhero origin story"" format and does little to detract from that. However, considering how interesting the main character is, this does not draw away too much enjoyment from the overall film.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10"

","just back from my viewing this morning (it is opened 30/5 here i n HK). I admit i was having lot of doubts before getting to this movie. First of all, still no review yet on RT only few days before US opening ( always a bad sign). Few users' reviews on the web and they seems to be too good to be REAL. And yesterday i saw few users here saying those good reviews are fake and giving horrific 1 star and rant on the movie ( will get back to this on the latter part), my heart dropped dead. <br/><br/>Forgetting all those worries and trying to be neutral as best to see what i am going to get out from this film, i could say i should never saw those evil, brutal 1 star users' ""what to say"". This movie is REALLY REALLY GOOD!!!! Those good reviews are no lie at all. Everyone agrees wonder women was the highlight Of the BVS. This movie elevates that into another level!! The story really give depth to the character, Gal Gadot is really charming as the wonder women. The action sequence was made beautifully and the final act was just WOW that it gave me a chill that i was longing for a superhero film.<br/><br/>Inevitably, people do compare this to those Marvel works. For me, Wonder woman is on pal with Ironman 1 & Captain America 2 winder solider. And people have to bear in mind DC is always different from Marvel, that is the reason it make this movie or DC movie so cool. i do enjoy watching Marvel stuffs, they are always entertaining and action packed, but that's all, they are kind of forgettable and lack of depth. Except Ironman 1, CA2 or maybe civil war, i don't really think other Marvels are really that great, some are even not good to me (i.e. Thor, IM3..). DC movie is not afraid of stepping into the dark side of the human heart, it will give u something meaningful to ponder on....WonderWomen's backstory is set on the WW1, the darkest moment for the humanity. it is the path for wonder women to realize who she really is and what she stands for out of knowing human is the one to blame for all the evil and terrible things they are capable of but human is also fond of love and capable of building better world. The story is so compelling.<br/><br/>To those people who could rate movie at 1 star. i mean how could you do that just because you don't like it or simply you are fan of Marvel. We really need different kind of movies more than just always one similar formula."

"Thekeybaldemasterrises","8","49","107","2 June 2017"," The best DC movie since Batman 89. Yes even better than the Dark Knight Trilogy.
","This movie left me with so many emotions it's so relieving. Whether your a fan of the DCEU or not, this movie is a game changer. Not just for DC films, not just comic book movies, but for all summer blockbusters going forward. It's sets a new standard that Hollywood should really follow. Going into Wonder Woman I was expecting little to nothing, I was more forgiving when it came to the last few attempts like Dawn of Justice/Suicide Squad but I wanted them to do better. I wanted DC to show people they're capable of telling great stories on film again like Superman 78, Batman 89, Batman Begins etc. Ladies and gentlemen I'm happy to say with all my confidence that Wonder Woman is just wonderful. It's full of action, heart, and just mesmerizing heroism. To see Gal Godot embody the character in one particular moment of the film it brought a tear to my eye, because it felt like watching Christopher Reeve become Superman or Michael Keaton become Batman. It was just awe inspiring and I didn't want the movie to end. It accomplishes what a superhero film should do, inspire. It left the audience inspired from beginning to end and I could feel it. Nobody said a word in my theatre, you could hear the food crunching and the cup sipping stop because everyone was all into it. I gotta thank Gal Gadot for taking on the challenge of portraying such an iconic character especially when so many doubted her in the beginning. She's become my new favorite actress in the comic book movie world and I want to see more of her. I hope Patty Jenkins returns for a sequel or another hero's film (Man of Steel 2 maybe?). She really understood the core value of Diana and gave us a movie about the journey of a legend, who sees the good and bad of life. Through that it's a return to form of great storytelling that's the best of DC since Batman 89. Yes I know that's saying a lot about it being better than the Dark Knight Trilogy but it accomplishes the core values of what the Justice League represents, truth, honor, justice, being kind hearted, caring about people. My problem with The Dark Knight in particular is the villain overshadows the hero and you loose that important aspect of who you're rooting for in your movie. Wonder Woman brings that old school feel of superheroes back by really just showing you an inspiring Gal Gadot who just nails it here, I can't stress that enough. If you love the DCEU you're gonna love this movie obviously. If you've had issues or completely hated the recent movies I still recommend giving this movie a chance. It's worth seeing alone for the chemistry of Gadot and Chris Pine who carry this movie on their backs. I hope the future movies have as much care and inspiration as this one did because it's truly like watching a comic book character come to life and retaining everything you looked up to in these characters. If I had to really complain about one thing I would just say pacing. There are times in the first act-second act that feel like filler and it starts to slow down. That's just nitpicking I really don't think this movie is anywhere near bad. Go see Wonder Woman guys regardless of what side your on, at the end of the day it's just a very well made movie."

","The DC Universe gets a powerful boost with Patty Jenkin's engaging, thrilling modern tribute to the Wonder Woman legend. The trailer did not do justice to this polished, beautifully rendered film with an uncommon heart, contrasting the increasingly tired, smug Marvel tone. <br/><br/>The British supporting cast add a deeper flair to the proceedings, with Lucy Davis and David Thewlis offering smart performances. Gal Gadot channels a mixture of innocence, strength, wisdom and humour which reminded me of Christopher Reeve in Superman (1978). The script gives her performance a spirit and urgency which the origin story frame allows to flourish. Chris Pine is equally fine, balancing a challenging mixture of humility and bravado that gives the film a distinct edge.<br/><br/>The parallels with Superman (1978) are particularly apt. Both films kick-started modern takes on legendary figures with colourful, exciting adaptations of origin stories. The actions sequences are intense, clever and filled with emotional resonance."

","So in the current era where the media and Hollywood really try to give us more movies with female main characters, Wonder Woman is for me the main and only example of how to get it right. How ? Simple. Actual character development through a good story and good writing and likable side characters. Especially Steve Trevor played by Chris Pine. The visuals are great (although at the end I question the CGI for Ares) but the reason I'm giving it only 9 stars is because the villains are nothing to write home about. They get the job done, but that's it. They're still better than Steppenwolf though."

","Wonder Woman is the rise to form that the DC Extended Universe so desperately needed. It follows the typical origin story formula, but it's more coherently paced and stabilizes the tone much more intelligently than the previous DCEU installments. Gal Gadot nails the role of Wonder Woman with a deft balance of headstrong charisma and comical innocence. The action is stylized and wickedly entertaining, and Diana's naive interactions with real world customs (especially during a time period where women were looked down upon) make for some clever comedic relief. The first act was kinda bland with little exploration and inventiveness put into Diana's home-world, but overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Wonder Woman. It renewed my faith in the DCEU and I pray that the filmmakers continue to learn from their past flaws and produce even better spectacles in the coming years."
"elizabethpolishan","10","36","76","19 June 2017"," A Beautiful Reflection on The Human Condition
","Many reviews complained that Diana and Ares aren't complex characters, or that they are ""generic"" but this is simply untrue. First, Diana and Ares are extremely well-suited for each other as a hero/villain duo. *Spoilers* We learn at the end of the movie that Ares never actually controls men and compels them to go to war; in fact, what he REALLY WANTS is to restore earth to the paradise that it once was--before human beings, in THEIR corruption--destroyed it.<br/><br/>And initially, the restoration of earth to a peaceful paradise is Diana's motivation as well. She also wants to restore earth to an idyllic paradise, free of war and corruption. Diana and Ares' shared motivation reminds me of the shared motivation of Batman and the Joker (i.e., they are both vying for control of Gotham City, though Batman wants it to be ordered, while the Joker wants it to slip into chaos). Like Batman and Joker, Ares and Diana initially want virtually the same thing, which really allows their struggles to compliment one another. Yet, when Diana ultimately gains a little wisdom and realizes that human beings themselves have ""destroyed"" the paradise of the earth, and not Ares, she has the capability to also see the beauty in the human condition.<br/><br/>Diana loves humans. Ares does not. Ares--a ""villain""--wants PURE peace. And Diana--the ""hero""-- actually does not, because she realizes that in order for there to be pure peace, humans would really have to be entirely wiped out. And she authentically loves humans. <br/><br/>In short, these characters are complex. Diana grows--she learns how to love, and she completely changes her mission. And the God of War's motivation is the restoration of paradise--talk about complexity of character. <br/><br/>*Side note*--It's also nice to see Diana build a team to help her. She doesn't talk all the credit for her mission, nor does she try to. She willingly enlists and accepts the help of several highly trained men. This was a nice change from superhero movies that focus so heavily on the hero being, well, a hero--and doing it all him or herself. Friendship, love, teamwork--those are important too. <br/><br/>A final note:<br/><br/>In an interview, Samantha Robinson (writer and director of The Love Witch) said something along the lines of how she was always interested with the idea of women who are the ""centerfold. There they are, ready to be ogled and looked at, right in the literal center of the action, but what is going on in their head? No one asks them. They have blank eyes, blank faces, and they're all object--no subject.<br/><br/>I didn't get the sense that Diana was an empty-eyed centerfold at all. That is, even though she is absolutely stunning and sexy, she is irreducible to her sex appeal. Her eyes are always alive. I noticed this especially in the scene where she learns how to dance--she's looking around at the snow, at her friends--she's investigating the world, and she doesn't even need to say anything, but I could see her beauty shine as not just a mere object, but as a subject--exploring, taking in, discovering, the world. Truly beautiful. <br/><br/>Anyone who complains about ""bad CGI"" or ""flat characters"" or a ""predictable plot"" or ""it's too feminist"" or ""it's not feminist enough"" is I think, missing the point of the movie, and missing a really beautiful insight into the nature of human nature."
"bob-the-movie-man","8","36","76","10 June 2017"," Amazonian's Deliver!
","The much anticipated new Wonder Woman movie is with us, and for once the film lives up to the wall-to-wall marketing hype.<br/><br/>With a heavy dose of mythology, Diana is growing up as the cossetted daughter of Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen, ""Gladiator""), the Queen of the Amazons, on the hidden paradise island of Themyscira. Trained up as a warrior by Hippolyta's sister, General Antiope (Robin Wright of ""House of Cards""), Diana is clearly something special. Her ego is reinforced by the knowledge that she was made of clay with life breathed into her by the God Zeus.  It's enough to turn a girl's head!<br/><br/>It's 1917 and the man-free paradise is shaken up when an American spy by the name of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine, ""Star Trek: Beyond"") crash- lands in the waters off Themyscira.  (And yes... you didn't mishear me... this film genuinely features a hero with both the names ""Steve"" and 'Trevor""). Prince Eric - no, sorry, wrong film - is saved and awakened on the beach by Diana as the others arrive.  ""Thank God!"", say the Amazonians. ""At last, someone to process the 200 year backlog of washing and ironing""!  <br/><br/>But Steve (an ""above average specimen"", LOL) is not long for paradise as he needs to return to the war with the results of his spy-work: a chemistry book stolen from the gorgeously deformed Dr Maru (Elena Anaya), gas-developer for the evil General Ludendorff (Danny Huston). Seeing Ludendorff to be her God-like nemesis Ares, Diana returns with Steve to the WW1 battlefields with the intent of killing the God of War and so ending the 'war to end all wars'.<br/><br/>Much 'fish out of water' fun is had with Diana meeting civilised London society, although perhaps this section of the film doesn't quite live up to its full potential:  having ice cream for the first time, without any sign of surprise, all she can come up with is an amusing but rather lame ""You must be very proud"".<br/><br/>But where the film really accelerates into awesomeness is when Diana reaches the trenches. She emerges from the trenches like some shimmering vision of hotness, to set male and lesbian hearts a flutter. Its the most memorable trench-exit since the finale of ""Black Adder 4"", and the subsequent scenes of Diana single-handedly facing the German guns is for me one of the most compelling and enjoyable scenes in any recent DC or Marvel movie.<br/><br/>Holding all this together is the ex-Israeli army-trainer Gal Gadot in the title role. And man oh man, what a Gal! Statuesque, athletic but also sweet, charming and emotionally fragile she completely owns this role from beginning to end.  Gadot made a memorable entry in the otherwise poor ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (#marthagate #neverforget #neverforgive) but nothing prepares you for just how great she is in this outing. <br/><br/>Chris Pine - the thinking women's Chris Pratt - once again proves himself as a talented actor who manages to successfully morph to inhabit the role he plays. Much as he did in the excellent ""Hell or High Water"", not once did I equate him to be James Tiberius Kirk after the first 5 minutes. <br/><br/>Effective in supporting roles are David Thewlis (""Harry Potter"") as a 'helpful' army bod and an almost unrecognisable Lucy Davis (""The Office"") as Etta, Steve's comedic secretary.  Steve's rather unlikely sidekicks of Sameer (Said Taghmaoui, ""American Hustle""), Charlie (Ewen Bremner, ""Trainspotting"") and 'The Chief' (Eugene Brave Rock ""The Revenant"") all rather fade into the woodwork by comparison. <br/><br/>I saw the film in 3D (""careful now... you could take an eye out with those things"") and very good it was too. Aside from some rather unnecessary Amazonian arrows, its never feels overdone, and elements of it were extremely effective.<br/><br/>Another star of the show is the superb Wonder Woman theme by Hans Zimmer, here rolled out by the film's composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (""Hacksaw Ridge""). Unfortunately, the rest of the soundtrack is not particularly memorable.<br/><br/>The film shifts into more traditional yawn-worthy 'superhero finale' mode in the last twenty minutes, which is a bit of a shame. <br/><br/>Patty Jenkins (""Monster"") directs and knows the audience she is aiming to please. One can only imagine the empowering impact this film will have on young girls, crossing their wrists and in their imagination casting terrorists into the hell that they should be consigned to.

","Looking for a strong female character driven movie? Look no further. Don't hate her because she is beautiful and has super powers.<br/><br/>Here's a summer super hero movie that delivers.

The first battle scene on the beach sets the tone. This is about good versus evil. <br/><br/>It's a good time at the movies and should be seen in a theater. There didn't seem to be much added seeing it in 3D. There are an abundance of night and dark scenes that need all the projection light they can get. Perhaps the 3D projection system and glasses make things a tad to dark. <br/><br/>The strong box office will insure we will see more of Wonder Woman.

","I would have given the film an 8 but Gal deserves the extra star as the first hero from the JLA universe who doesn't look a try-hard.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot has the charisma and was a scene-stealer in the Fast & Furious franchise. As Diana Prince, she really shone. She conveyed sensitivity, self-confidence and passion like a veteran and full credit to her efforts in preparing for this role.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, the action scenes were well done, the support cast gave solid performances, the plot believable and the screenplay pacey without being rushed.<br/><br/>All in all, an entertaining package that shows all concerned that DC adaptations work best when you DO NOT let David Goyer anywhere near the script. Justice League too would do better without him.<br/><br/>First DC flick I've enjoyed in years!!. One I will definitely watch again."

","A WWI battlefield, shrouded in gun smoke and war remains, is flanked by trenches of soldiers who've accepted their fate of spending the rest of their short lives in this hell. On one end, a powerful but naïve woman slowly emerges, armed with a shield, a sword and a bundle of conviction to put an end to all of it. In this one sure-to-be iconic moment, the world is (re-)introduced to its new favorite superhero. Wonder Woman, an unabashed woman-empowerment film, uses its pre-established muscle for good: to give us a blockbuster full of true excitement, true humor and true heart. Being a wartime-superhero film, we expect a certain quality of action, and this delivers; the beach attack on the island full of Amazon women is a slow-motion blast of flying and fighting. But what really soars is the script, filled with dialogue that surprisingly pops (""We can't fix the war, but we can try to get to the men who can."" ""I AM the men who can!""). Elements of fish-out-of-water, believable romance and confident humor are more than consistent enough to the small moments of predictability, corn and bad visual effects. I can't help but imagine: what if this was our introduction to the Justice League universe? Instead of the faux-complexity of the Superman entries or the offensive simplicity of Suicide Squad, we'd be setting the tone for the franchise with a film about the effects of violence, the insanity of war and whether humans are inherently good or evil. Either way, it's so great to report that DC has more than righted their course and made a genre film for the ages."

"HillstreetBunz","9","37","79","18 June 2017"," Finally, a brilliant spectacle that doesn't rely on the spectacle alone!
","Having become mightily bored by the glut of formulaic American super hero movies, with their incoherent plots, appalling dialogue, and suspect morality, only ever partially redeemed by their creative visuals and incredible special effects, I had no desire to subject myself to yet another. But the weather was so hot today I whisked my ten year old nephew to the only 'family' movie in our local air conditioned cinema. Immediately this new world was a visual treat, and the necessary background to WW unfolded like a Greek myth. A few hints of the Amazonian women swaggering like chaps in their training camp, and a couple of corny lines from WW love interest Chris Pine delivered in the expository style early on started to eat away at my disbelief, but these minor grumbles didn't portend and the movie grew in drama, spectacle, tension and intensity. My young companion turned to me saying 'this movie is amazing', and I agree. Gal Gadot and Pine are both credible actors (it's not his fault he's too pretty to be a 'real' hero) and they are well served by an above average script (especially for this kind of movie). David Threwlis brings serious acting chops to the table as expected, but the revelation is Lucy Davis, whose comedic sidekick could carry a show of her own. The audience loved her, and laughed along at every nuance. Her charisma bounced out of the screen and reminded me of the superb character actors of the old studios in the decades before the end of that system; e.g. Eve Arden, Margaret Rutherford, Mary Wickes, Joan Blondell et al. Stardom awaits. I won't overplay the feminist/girl power angles, but if my ten year old nephew loved it as he did, then I can confidently say most young boys will too. Drag them there, the girls too! It's a joy."

"Marthian80","7","29","60","27 July 2017"," Entertaining action movie with a fine cast and some good jokes
","Wonder woman starts with showing where wonder woman (aka Diana Prince) came from: the amazons who live on the island Themyscira. The island is somewhere near Greece but hidden from view by a strange fog for normal people. We follow how Diana grows up to become one of the greatest amazon to have ever lived. On the day of her final training something strange happens: a German plane from the first world war breaks through the fog surrounding Themyscira and crashes into the sea. Diana rescues the man (Steve, a British spy played by Chris Pine) inside the plane, but he is pursued by German soldiers who also break through the fog. The Germans are quickly defeated by the mighty amazon warriors and learn from Steve that the whole world is currently fighting a great war. Diana thinks it must be the work of Ares, the god of war and that it is time to wield the god killer sword to put an end to Ares once and for all. Together with Steve and his friends she leaves the island of Themyscira to go to horrific front of the first world war, trying to find and defeat Aris. <br/><br/>I went into this movie a bit skeptical, because I wasn't impressed by Batman VS Superman where (the modern version) Wonder Woman made her entrance. But the character is interesting so I was curious how her origin story panned out. The start of the movie was a bit to serious/high fantasy for me but once Chris Pine enters the picture, it get's a lot lighter in tone and I started to like it a lot more. I really like Pine in The scenes where Diana enters London and get's in contact with 1910's civilization are hilarious and Gal Gadot does a fine job playing someone who's from a different world. I also liked the supporting cast who play Steve's friends, lot's of humor in those scenes. <br/><br/>The action scenes where mostly very well done. Cool slow motion effects and very good stunt work. My only gripe was that the CGI doubles of wonder woman and her opponents where a bit to obvious in a few scenes. And like in many comic book movies, this movie also suffered from a bad guy that was not impressive at all. The final confrontation was a bit to predictable and way to much CGI effects for my taste. But there was an emotional touch in the ending which was well done and unexpected. <br/><br/>Wonder woman is an enjoyable action movie with great action scenes and some good laughs. Recommended if your in for an entertaining action movie with some fantasy elements."

"terrellrobinson71","9","16","30","4 June 2017"," You'll be seeing lots of colorful wonders when you're with this Wonder Woman
","For the past 76 years, Wonder Woman has been such an iconic female character in the DC universe. She always proves that if men (superheroes included) can fight against the darkness, the women can do it too. With her sword, shield and Lasso of Truth, she fights for what she believes in and is always there to help those who are weak. Now the time has come for Wonder Woman to make her way to the big screen for the first time ever and the results are phenomenal. And if you remember Lynda Carter stepping into that costume and saving the day in the classic '70s show, then you will definitely remember Isreali sweetheart Gal Gadot as the feisty, tough and big-hearted superheroine. After her scene-stealing debut performance as the Amazonian princess in the flawed, but totally entertaining ""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice"", I say it's about time that a female superhero gets her chance to shine in her own film. After a year in waiting for this movie to come out, I can say this with a happy heart, this movie is the ride that definitely lives up to the hype. Deftly directed by Patty Jenkins, who gave Charlize Theron an unforgettable performance--and an Oscar---as the serial killer Aileen Wuornos in ""Monster"", ""Wonder Woman"" embraces its origin story with enough humor, heart and stunningly choreographed action sequences that it never drags or sags, it just comes alive in a real colorful way. Born in the all-female island of Themyscira, Diana (Gadot), daughter of Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), has always wanted to be a warrior just like her mother and her aunt Antiope (Robin Wright). In the years that followed, Diana has been training and preparing for action, but discovers that she has powers that are astonishing. Next thing we know, a young soldier named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) lands on the island and Diana is exposed to a more darker side of human nature where bullets are ripping out of their guns and lives are lost. Steve manages to warn these ladies that war is coming (the World War, in fact) with highly impossibly created weapons invented by Doctor Poison (Elena Anaya) and General Lundendorff (Danny Huston). So Diana leaves her paradise home and travels to London with Steve to fight and to find the one God that actually caused it (I think you know what I am talking about). Part of the fun and heart of this movie is watching Diana exploring and learning about the good and dark side of life. As war causes pain, casualties, and emotions, they can sometimes bring us hope that the world can change, even if it's not as better as one would expect. Along the way, Diana and Steve got the help they need in some unlikely characters including Steve's smart assistant Etta Candy (Lucy Davis), a Scottish sharpshooter named Charlie (Ewen Bremmer) who is struggling with PTSD and a master of disguise named Sameer (Said Taghmaoui) as they fight their way into enemy territory with lots of surprises left in store for them. After the superb ""Man of Steel"", and the flawed, but somewhat good ""BVS"" and ""Suicide Squad"", ""Wonder Woman"" is the DC film I've been waiting for. Here is a rousing, colorful and heartfelt adventure that has big laughs, cool action, characters that you can actually root for and a climax that may be as typical as one might expect from a superhero movie, but it's filled with more emotional power that some might not see coming. The cast that Jenkins has managed to put together, including the awesome David Thewlis in a pivotal role you have to witness for yourself, is amazing. I've always been a fan of Chris Pine's work, following his best performances in the brilliant ""Hell or High Water"" and the ""Star Trek"" films. The cocky demeanor that he brings to Captain Kirk is actually quite useful in the role of Steve Trevor and he has an real undeniable chemistry with Gadot. Plus, the screenplay by Allan Heinberg gives us dialogue that crackles with sly humor (Most of the hearty laughs comes from Sameer, Etta and of course, Diana & Steve) and a lot of exposition that creates a more streamlined plot that is more reserved for a film like this. To end this review, let me say something about Gal Gadot. It's not easy to fill the shoes of Wonder Woman that was once inhabited by Lynda Carter. But she makes it look effortless and puts a lot of hard work into the character. She gives such a remarkable and endearing performance as Wonder Woman and I think this is the one that might actually make her a big star and the character that I can't wait to see again. She's wonderful. So is the movie."
"Providenceyaway","8","26","53","27 June 2017"," I never thought I'd be using the word ""adorable"" to describe Wonder Woman.
","In DC's new installation, director Patty Jenkins and co breathe new life into the 75-year-old iconic character. Created for the purpose of ""fighting using love"", Wonder Woman had always been a interesting character to include in stories, but hard to pinpoint when it came to personality. After the last 3 DC movies I said no more for me. I'm glad a friend changed my mind on that. I didn't go to see it because it was the next chapter in a cinematic universe, I saw it because it told a story (and the hype behind all the critic reviews, of course). And there's a perfect balance to her: she's not sexual used by virtue of her appearance, and she's not a feminist. She's just a woman, who shows vulnerability, and wants there to be world peace. I was so surprised by how much they humanized her. Inspite of the fact that she was a stonehard killer, she looked at the world mostly through the eyes of a little girl. And I never expected that. I didn't just like it because it was a great movie, I also liked it because this is the best incarnation of Wonder Woman I've ever seen, even compared to the animated features. If you want a movie with great world history, a little bit of mythology, and an awesome ""new"" superhero the center of it all, I'd recommend checking this one out. This took decades to get to, and even Joss Whedon admitted it was too complicated for him to make. Don't watch this because of the Cinematic Universe, watch it because it's a good movie with (finally) a well-made message behind it."
"drawlife","8","26","53","30 May 2017"," Wonderous and wonderful.
","Wow. <br/><br/>Let me just get this out of the way. I love both Marvel and DC. I want them all to be good, but if I'm being honest, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad are complete misfires. They're both messy, mishandled, with a lot of corporate meddling. However, Wonder Woman is the complete opposite. This marks a second great DC film for WB in my books(I know there are people who love/hate Man of Steel, but I happened to really like it). <br/><br/>Princess Diana, otherwise known as Wonder Woman here is fully realized and completely three-dimensional. She finally gets her due in cinema and I cannot be more pleased. She's idealistic yet naive, compassionate, yet stubborn, and brave. I typically dislike origin stories, but every now and then they can be very fun, and Wonder Woman is that exception. Patty Jenkins who led Charlize Theron to an Oscar, brings a story that is packed with heart without ever getting too over the top or too heavy handed. During the hype train I disliked the idea of Gal Gadot, mainly due to her inexperience as an actor. She slightly won me over for the short amount of time she was in Batman v Superman, but now she really won me over. I will admit, there are moments where she didn't exactly deliver her lines effectively, but I think the more she plays this character the more better she'll be. <br/><br/>Chris Pine is great in the role of Steve Trevor. Again, while I thought some of Gadot's delivery felt dry or cheesy, she and Pine do have a great chemistry. I always preach about this, and even if it sounds like overkill at this point, but chemistry is so important with anything that has to do with romance. The romance here is solid and believable. In a very good way it was very reminiscent of Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter. <br/><br/>The supporting cast are solid, highlights include Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright portray Queen Hippolyta and General Antiope, and they're not characters who get the short end of the stick, they actually contribute to Diana's upbringing. The supporting cast is good too. Pine's Trevor recruits a ragtag team, again reminiscent of The Howling Commandos in Captain America: The First Avenger. <br/><br/>Taking a page off Marvel though, the villains are the ones who do end up getting the short end of the stick. There is a twist I didn't see coming, but even then it was a bit excessive and kind of out of place. I will say though, I happened to enjoy only Elena Anaya's creepy Doctor Poison out of the film's villains. <br/><br/>The third act is slightly underwhelming, but the action scenes are fantastic. I was quite surprised as I was concerned about Patty Jenkins' ability to shoot action. Also they're lit in daylight and being able to see everything unfold is just pure eye-candy. Something I appreciated is that Jenkins also shows the casualty of what war brings and she doesn't compromise on the gruesome reality of it. Visual effects are good, but there are few moments where its so obvious that it's cgi. I'm not very picky in that department, but when it's too too noticeable, then it automatically takes me out of the film.<br/><br/>I did mention Captain America: The First Avenger multiple times, and the film takes some influences and operates like it, but it's not a carbon copy at all. On the surface Wonder Woman might appear to be of similar adventures and superhero films that we've seen on screen, but it's moving parts and the little things it does that makes the film shine. With good character moments, humorous banter, and a resonating romance, it is the female superhero film that we needed. <br/><br/>8.5/10"
"octagonproplex","6","23","46","3 June 2017"," Well whatever... it's fine... Gal Gadot is legit at least.
","As of this writing (premiere weekend), there is a major movement for some reason to astronomically exalt this comic adaptation as a masterpiece, but it doesn't even come close. It's half-way decent, and I do mean half-way. The good half consisting primary of Gal Gadot. She has nice physical presence and prowess, and authoritatively pulls off both wisdom and naÃ¯vetÃ©. I'd go so far as to say she's great as Princess Diana of Themyscira (Wonder Woman). But she's the only thing here that is.<br/><br/>As I have no inclination to regurgitate synopses, we're SPOILER FREE!<br/><br/>The script is paint-by-numbers, yet still manages to stray outside the lines and become messy. I WANT to suspend disbelief and buy into fantastical premises but they've got to portray the characters and circumstances as though a rationality does pervade the whimsy. The depicted societies have no reality to them -- not the WWI men in trenches, British high command, the German enemy, much less Princess Diana's hidden Amazonian homeland isle of Themyscira. Each comes across artificial, without any notion that people actually live and breath there. Few of the jokes land -- precisely because their origins don't feel established and genuine (the heart of humor is truth, after all). The villains have no human dimension or motivation, therefore are not a relatable threat. The heroes agency and drive are equally unclear. The stakes are not given proper grounding, and what is given is unnaturally forced.<br/><br/>The mythic Amazonians are a civilization of all female multi-ethnic platonics shaped from clay and brought to life by Zeus. As far as anyone can tell, their cloaked Greek island paradise of Themyscira has only one rule -- its inhabitants must wear incredibly uncomfortable metallic corsets and the shortest of leather skirts at all times (cotton blends are forbidden, I guess). Although we see no evidence, apparently the Amazonians are taught philosophy and over 100 different languages. Curiously they're oblivious to the civilizations that birthed those languages and ideas, or what lie outside their peaceful tranquility -- yet spend the majority of their time training for primeval war anyway. Diana is a ""Amazonian Warrior Princess"" who fervently espouses the supposed Amazonian high virtue that the destructiveness of war is evil and compassion is the solution -- yet seemingly has no qualm indiscriminately participating in battles she has next to nil understanding of. She must have personally widowed 20 German wives, yet lectures how heinous it is to war. Huh? Then why are you warring? If your sage society of feminist philosophers are so peace loving then why do they seemingly do nothing except practice fighting? Why don't you use your language and reasoning skills to treaty with the poor German grunts long stuck in the muddy trenches instead of simply running over them with death -- since killing is what you're against and all?<br/><br/>The acting performances are mostly good, but I really can't say I felt much chemistry between Diana and her ""leading man"" Steve Trevor -- perhaps it's emasculation, as Gadot just seems far more autonomous and capable. To his credit, the fine and charming Chris Pine almost makes the clunky character dynamics and dim dialogue sing. Everyone else is a cardboard cutout, and bizarrely so -- their standout oddities and anachronisms remedy character development I suppose. Amongst the prerequisite paper-thin rag-tag team of misfit heroes, there's a drunk singing Scotsman who wears a kilt, and a Native American Indian who wears a feather. At one point Steve Trevor's lady secretary quips that from time-to-time she's up for a bit of fisticuffs -- briefly feigning a Karate chop stance, as if Asian martial arts had in any way permeated the consciousness of turn-of- the-century English ladies. Just preposterous. It's as though the casting director corralled her niece to play Diana as a child -- unfortunate cheerios commercial syndrome of acting by way of chubby cheeks comes across like a pageant brat. There's no sense of her being the thoughtfully resolved rebel that we're supposed to infer her to be, and her features carry no stoic beauty. Not the kid's fault, but ill advised casting nonetheless. <br/><br/>Analysis of the antagonists would be spoilery, but I can assure that it is not done well. All is caricatured in out-of-nowhere logic. And a poor villain, is a poor conflict, which is poor drama -- and that makes for a poor story. Audiences need rogues whose fate they can take relish in, whose dastardly motivations warrant investment in seeing toppled.<br/><br/>Finally, the direction: It's pedestrian at best. Patty Jenkins must have done something right once upon a time because there is certainly a massive constituency that are dead-set on making her a thing. Admitly I've never seen HBO's ""Game Of Throwns"", but Patty Jenkins' work there was apparently her calling card for helming big spectacle. All I can say is that I'm not terribly inspired to ever delve into that insanely popular tome, due in part to the fact that every film sprung from its progeny has had less than impressive craft. Jenkins compensates for any cohesive design in choreography or kinetics in action sequences with slow-motion (perhaps story writer Zach Snyder's insidious influence?). I'm not saying slow-motion is bad, I'm saying Patty Jenkins uses it badly as a crutch. Whether it be intimate scenes or bombastic action, the rhythm and pacing often felt off throughout. The cinematography was adequate, but nothing worth note. Same for the music score. Serviceable and generic -- that's this movie.<br/><br/>In the end ""Wonder Woman"" is a fairly innocuous, but also vacuous, diversion. Its most ""super"" element is its super-hypocrisy of ideals, but... whatever. It's silly and does contain moments of escapists fun. Enjoy."
"MaximumMadness","8","10","17","5 June 2017"," ""Wonder Woman""- Not only the first truly good film for the DCEU, but just a darned fun movie on its own right!
","If there was one thought to streak across my mind throughout the entire run-time of director Patty Jenkins' long-awaited cinematic adaptation of the iconic comic-book character ""Wonder Woman"", it's a simple word... redemption. This is the first film in DC's struggling Extended Universe to live up to the promise of its comic-book origins. There have been hints at brilliance here and there, but the three previously released films have all ultimately faltered and fallen flat due to their own numerous issues and contrivances and infuriating focus on convoluted style over substance. Not so with ""Wonder Woman""... this is the first film in the entire series that places all of it's focus on delivering a charming, thrilling and entertaining film foremost, where the style is dictated by the story, and not the other way around.<br/><br/>If you've grown tired of waiting for the next great DC cinematic adventure. If like me and many others, previous releases like ""Batman V Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"" left you feeling empty and angry and underwhelmed. If you were worried that the DCEU would just be a constant exercise in misery and tedium... your hopes for something better- something good- have been fulfilled with the absolutely delightful ""Wonder Woman."" It's not a perfect film, mind you. It's uneven at times and suffers the same one-dimensional villains that have plagued the similar Marvel Cinematic Universe. But it is a promise of better things to come in the future, and is not only by and far the best the DCEU has to offer at this point... it's just a darned good film in its own right.<br/><br/>On the island of Themyscira, Diana (Gal Gadot) lives in peace, princess of a tribe of Amazon warriors created by the great Greek Gods to protect humanity from the clutches of Ares- God of War. However, the human world soon enough intrudes on Diana's idyllic life when American Spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash-lands near her home and she and the other Amazon warriors are told of the ""Great War"" that is taking place- World War I. Diana goes against her mother's wishes and leaves the island with Steve, hoping that in helping him on his mission to stop a deadly chemical attack by the German army, she will be able to confront Ares and put an end to all war. But at what cost will her daring mission come?<br/><br/>The great success of ""Wonder Woman"" comes in large part from its simplicity and keen storytelling. It doesn't venture into needlessly lofty and overstuffed (and half-baked) themes and sequel-baiting as has been the case with previous installments of the DC franchise, but instead just tries its hardest to be a competent, concise and entertaining origin story. And that's why it succeeds. Director Jenkins and screenwriter Allan Heinberg smartly concentrate on the fundamentals of character establishment and development above all else, while also giving the film a great deal more personality than has been evident in previous films. With razor-sharp writing, top-notch action set pieces and a constant and appropriate sense of humor that keeps the chuckles coming, you'd be hard pressed not to find yourself grinning ear-to- ear throughout the entire film. <br/><br/>The cast is also just a ton of fun. Gadot was by and far the best element in the otherwise sloppy ""Batman V Superman"", but she wasn't given much to do. Here, she absolutely shines and proves herself more than worthy to call herself ""Wonder Woman."" She's got the dramatic chops to handle the heavier moments, the light-hearted whimsy to perfectly land the film's many delightful ""fish out of water"" gags... and she just kicks major butt! I can't wait to see her again on the big-screen. I also quite enjoyed Pine in his supporting role. It's a bit of a standard character, but he gives it the same wonderful personality he's injected to so many other roles. And supporting parts played by the likes of Robin Wright, Connie Nielsen and SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui are all exceptionally well-cast and performed.<br/><br/>This praise all being said, the film does have some rather large issues that I feel are being generally overlooked. Especially with the film being as hyped up and over-politicized as it has been. Funnily enough, the film suffers a major issue that also desperately plagues many films of their rival studio Marvel- the villains are weak. Pathetic even. Despite having the delightful duo of Danny Huston and Elena Anaya portraying them, the villainous Erich Ludendorff and ""Doctor Poison"" are frankly laughable at times, coming off as so stock as to be ridiculous. At times they even feel like they're in a completely different (and far inferior) film. I know I can't be the only one to cringe when they repeatedly use the old trope of ""villain kills an associate to show he's a threat"" several times to increasingly hilarious results. In addition, the film is a bit uneven as it reaches its midway point, with several key characters from the first act seemingly vanishing and some plot-threads being abandoned for prolonged periods of time. It's a bit distracting. You know the film is capable of so much more.<br/><br/>But despite these complaints, I can't help but whole-heartedly recommend ""Wonder Woman."" It's just such a breath of fresh air for this particular franchise thanks to its smart filmmaking and fantastic performances. I was worried before the film came out. Because I will fully admit I have not enjoyed a single other film in the DC Extended Universe to this point, and I was fearing that ""Wonder Woman"" would deal one last fatal blow to the franchise. But it did just the opposite... it revitalized it in the best of ways. And I would favorably compare it to other great superhero origins of the past 10 years, and say it's one of my favorite Summer action films of 2017 thus far.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" gets a very good 8 out of 10."
"coreyjdenford","8","28","58","1 June 2017"," Wonderful Woman
","This review of Wonder Woman is spoiler free<br/><br/>**** (4/5)<br/><br/>THERE'S A SAYING, a metaphor perhaps that states if a series or a distributor starts with a few false starts in previous instalments then the hype for the next instalment will dwindle, this, of course is true for other series' of films but for the DCEU it clearly isn't. There have been a few false starts for the series, Man of Steel didn't live to expectation nor Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice wasn't as good as was previously thought then Suicide Squad fell into the world of shame rather than live up to what it said on the tin. It seem the DCEU was in need of a saviour, at first this saviour came from a meme â€“ this had a bruised Batman and tired Superman fighting in an endless war, then beyond that shadow stands Gal Gadot's Diana â€“ perhaps the saviour of BvS. <br/><br/>After Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman the metaphor loses its sight, and goes into turmoil, in the opening few minutes there's colour, a narration that explains the comings of war between gods and humans and a young Diana Prince (exceptional work from youngster Lilly Aspell) willing to train for a coming war. Her mother (Robin Wright) explains that there is no need to do this â€“ after this the origin of the princess progresses to when she is all grown up and has become a trained warrior. The opening origin story is exceptional there's a lot colour which we haven't seen in previous instalments, there's stunning story narration and a wonderful shot of Gadot's Diana training with her auntie (Connie Nielsen) the best fighter on the island. An island inhabited by women until a manly presence invades their homeland enter American spy Captain Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), he speaks of an ongoing war in the outer world. When he's teamed with Gadot their chemistry is magnificent these two work well together and prove to be the dynamic that we need. <br/><br/>Pine is exceptional as Steve, he's funny, he's handsome, and he's a charmer who does anything to please our heroine. Diana who's never seen a man before is wonderful to behold especially when she tells Steve about where she comes from. She wants to go with him to go fight the ongoing war â€“ meanwhile villainous doctor, Dr. Poison (Elana Anaya) and her warmongering companion Ludendorff (Danny Huston) design dangerous weapons to outfit their soldiers. It's a wonderful story of war and super heroism a mach that never made a keen pairing before but now-a-days it works. It's dark but constantly dark and brooding as the previous films, something that the earlier DCEU intended to rely on Wonder Woman proves that you don't need to be dark to be good. <br/><br/>And she does her job well, as Diana Gadot is fantastic she's a beautiful princess who loves the world of men and believes that life has a meaning, as her stronger alter ego she's exceptional, she's strong but on the inside she's vulnerable, unlike the caped crusaders or the men of steel she's not afraid to show emotion and the other wonder woman helming her director Jenkins shows this with exquisite style. Diana was the saviour in BvS, here she proves to be the saviour again who takes no BS. And Jenkins proves that a DC movie can have style too â€“ she adds a lot of elements here that makes this super-human feel more human as said she adds emotion there are other elements too the vulnerability makes her a more connectable superhero it proves strength in the female superhero line. <br/><br/>Sadly it's not wonderful, in the last 20 minutes it hits a clichÃ© cg barrier that other superhero movies seem to rely on now-a-days, there are some moments that look they're made from green screen and sadly doesn't make it as good as it could've been. Other than that everything here delivers exceptionally well Jenkins proves that could teach the caped crusaders or men of steel a thing or two with this instalment, it's she's brought new light to the DCEU and it's about damn time.<br/><br/>VERDICT: After a few false starts to the DCEU it finally has a success in fantastic style that hits punches with brilliant execution and fabulous performances this is perhaps the best instalment to the DCEU ever, now we can breathe again."

","I got to see this at an early screening and I am extremely happy to announce that I love the movie! Gal Gadot was the perfect cast for Wonder Woman! The action sequences are amazing. A great script and no editing problems (like in Suicide Squad). This is a very well made film. Patty Jenkins did a fantastic job. Chris Pine and Robin Wright are also really good. Wonder Woman is inspiring and people will look up to her for decades because of this film. The only flaw I have with this movie is the villain, felt very much just like a generic throw away Marvel villain."
"Anurag-Shetty","10","33","70","2 June 2017"," Finally a flawless superhero film, led by a woman.
","Wonder Woman tells the story of Diana(Gal Gadot), princess of the Amazons of Themyscira. Before she became Wonder Woman, she was a trained warrior. A pilot named Steve Trevor(Chris Pine), crash lands on the island of Themyscira. Diana finds out about the war that mankind is waging. She leaves home, decides to fight in the war & embraces her true destiny. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is an awe-inspiring movie. Director Patty Jenkins has done complete justice to this iconic character. The visual effects are spectacular. The action set pieces are mind blowing. All the action scenes, are even more exciting in 3D. The cinematography by Matthew Jensen is gorgeous. Both Themyscira(these portions were shot in Italy) & London look breathtaking. The humor in the film is refreshing, after the lack of humor in previous DC Extended Universe efforts like, Man of Steel(2013) & Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016). I'm so relieved that they didn't mess this up like the previous two female-led superhero outings, Catwoman(2004) & Elektra(2005). This movie is picture perfect, right from the first scene till the last scene. Gal Gadot is outstanding as Diana. Gadot steals the show with her masterful portrayal, of the most famous female superhero in the world. Chris Pine is brilliant as Steve Trevor. Connie Nielsen is excellent as Hippolyta. Robin Wright is fantastic as Antiope. Danny Huston is impressive as Ludendorff. David Thewlis is superb as Sir Patrick. Said Taghmaoui, Ewen Bremner, Eugene Brave Rock & Lucy Davis are awesome as Sameer, Charlie, The Chief & Etta, respectively. Elena Anaya is amazing as Dr. Maru. Lilly Aspell is adorable as Young Diana(8). Wonder Woman is a must watch for everyone. Go & celebrate this wonder of a woman! I'm waiting with bated breath for Justice League(2017)."
"tawhicks","8","19","37","7 August 2017"," Pleasantly Surprised
","I was pleasantly surprised with this movie and liked it. They did well by delving into the legend (although playing loosely with some mythology). Still, the movie was entertaining and Gadot effective. After hating Batman vs Superman, this was a relief. I hope DC's future offerings will be more like this and less like some of the weaker ones. One weakness of this movie was where they treated the WWI Germans as if they were Nazis. Great historical weakness there as there were huge differences between the First and Second World Wars."
"faroutsea","8","5","7","22 March 2019"," I liked it?
","If u want the comic original read the comics or the tv series find it on vhs! It's an opening to another marvel super hero, not a fact filled war film! Great to see the character is a feminine badass rather than 2d babe-arse. CGI was a bit underwhelming such as the gorgeous blue dress coming off as she rides off, it may have deserved a larger part of the frame having come from a sea of black, then again she the lead not some Bond girl. Oh and the circular pan shot when the plane crashes um? Yeah symbolism of what would be left behind if she jumped to the rescue needed more...um, just more.<br/><br/>All in all though I likes."
"pronker","8","5","7","17 March 2019"," World War I drew me into wanting to see this.
","After reading comics for over 40 years, it seemed a good choice for a Wonder Woman film because of the tired WWII origin story. Not to say I thought it was tired when first reading it at age 11! But it is tired to me now, and this movie's setting intrigued. So for what it's worth, the setting ruled and the story came second.<br/><br/>The story? Well, it plays around with my loved Greek mythology, but so did Disney in ""Hercules"". I expected that Ares and Hippolyta got together in some fashion to create Diana, whether by crafting her in ceramics class or the normal way; I didn't expect Zeus to have a hand in it. The whole gods dying thing was interesting, even if it did rub the wrong way. It's easier to think that Norse gods can die, but Greek gods? Nah. I don't know what to make of Diana being a god herself.<br/><br/>The ""I believe in love"" sentiment is hard to argue with as a theme. Chris Pine's presence certainly added a human being's perspective of ""we're not all bad, we're not all good."" That gave Diana plenty to chew on and the movie showed her doing just that as she observed first hand how humans are.<br/><br/>I liked Gadot in the role because she was convincing in her battle moves and in her naivetÃ©. She has learned about many things as a scholar does, from books and not real life. She has learned how to fight melee fashion and not from planes delivering bombs, or sniping with a Garand, or designing a new poison gas. The best things about her style were her use of her bracelets in the ""Bullets and Bracelets"" game of comic fame, and her deployment of her lasso. Many of the other athletic moves I've become jaded over after watching ""Captain America"" and ""Aquaman."" The bracelets and lasso are unique.<br/><br/>Neat things to take away: ""Gal"" could be short for ""Galatea,"" another carved creation. Also, seeing George Perez and Len Wein acknowledged in the credits rocked. Alsoalso, Paradise Island's conception fulfilled my hopes."
"Rainbowbeany","10","5","7","25 February 2019"," Wonder Woman saves the DC movie universe!
","This film is the first time Wonder Woman has had her own film and it doesn't disappoint! Not only is it a good superhero movie, it is also a good movie period. The action is awesome. Gal Gadot is perfection as Diana. She brings much more depth to the character than I could have imagined. I wouldn't be able to tell that this is her second movie as this character. It seems as if she has been playing her, her whole life. Or she was born to play this role. There is only a few times in the past that I have truly seen an actor truly embody a character and this is one of them. The world war 1 setting makes for an amazing story. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor is fantastic. Please watch this film not only for the action but for the character of Wonder Woman herself. We can all learn a lesson from her. I can't wait to see more Wonder Woman!"

She was strong and held her glory, as it should be in real life as well. Great to see this and I hope it wasn't just because the director is a woman."

"camrammer","9","5","7","7 December 2018"," A World Wonder.
","""Wonder Woman"" director Patty Jenkins succeeded in hitting all key points in this film. The emotion, direction, and storytelling aspect of this intense, WWI-based film. Yes, this isn't necessarily the most accurate when referring to the actions within World War I, but it finds great ways to relate events within the story with events in real life, such as the battle within No Man's Land.<br/><br/>The gender role switch is also a great element of this movie. Yes, in current times, superhero movies don't necessarily have a female protagonist, but this is also reflected in the time period, with Diana being noted multiple times of her malpropism involving elements especially surrounding her appearance. It does, however, display a great deal of the commotion of the world during the war, with multiple scenes showing struggle and conflict.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Wonder Woman"" is a film that shows anything from love to pure struggle. It's a great film that covers all the bases that should happen within a superhero movie. I would say my rating is still generous, however this is easily a 24,000/10 for a DC movie in the past 5 years. If I see another great movie like this from the company, I might consider subscribing to DC Universe."
"hannbell","10","5","7","24 November 2018"," Wonder Woman is an ICON.
","This movie is amazing because I love Wonder Woman and it's one of my favorite superhero films. I feel like anyone who watches this movie will really enjoy it because it has so much action and emotion, the fighting scenes are really well executed and super intense. This movie has such a good storyline too and it makes you feel so many emotions. It's about World War 1 and how they overcome the war with the help of Wonder Woman. Even though it's fiction it's still really inspiring. We see a lot of the trials that people had to face during the war, and not even to the full extent of their hardships. This movie was a good source of entertainment because many people love superheroes. My favorite part about this movie was the main character played by Chris Pine because I love him and he's a great actor. There is no part in this movie I didn't like because it's just that good. I love superheroes so I like to watch other movies like this one. The filming was pretty great, they got all the scenes just right and especially the fighting scenes, those were my favorite."

","I would recommed you should watch this movie because it shows you some of the old war and it has lots of action if you are into action movies. I liked how Diana took down the tower when she jumped off the guys backs. I liked how Diana killed Aries because it was kinda like a laser beam move from dragon ball z. I didn't like how Steve died, I felt like he could of jumped out and shot the plane. I watched this movie so I can get a grade and it's probably the best movie I have watched in this class."

","I watched this movie for my history through film class. I was the next one on the list. The filmmaker is telling the story of Wonder Woman and when she was introduced. This is done through WW1 even though she was made in WW2. The filmmaker took their own spin on the character but didn't do it right at all. The special effects are so well done that this movie couldn't have been made pre 2010. The actors are also like alive and have only aged a year so that helps too. Yes, the only accurate thing in the movie is the German general's name. Nothing else was accurate. I've see Wonder Woman in another movie. I liked the pretty much everything in the movie.

","There are the same bad reviews (the same few texts, that read like the same 12 year old had written them all) listed over and over. This feels like an organized act to vote this movie down. Never seen it like that on imdb though. Must have something to do with the strong female lead, it's really hard to explain this irrational behavour any other way. The movie is good, even if you don't like the actors or the premise, you should be able to admit that acting, action and story were solid, especially for a superhero film. No major plot holes, no stupid kung-fu fights, no inconsistend logic or powers. In many of these bad reviews there's a lot of complaining about the writing, but none of them explains how the writing is bad. I've seen the movie twice and I really couldn't tell you either. There are a few flaws in this film (like the formulaic structure), and if anyone doesn't like it because of them, i get that. But if you are male and don't really have logical reasons for hating on that movie, I guess you should check if it isn't your own insecurity that's responsible for that. Because it feels like there are some really frightened boys writing rewiews here, when they really should be dealing with their fears.
In my oppinion Wonder Woman is on the same level as the better offerings of Marvel. Highly recommended."

","Let mes start off by saying that I am not usually a big fan of superhero movies. They're all pretty much the same to me: some super villain threatens the whole world, the superhero tries to save the day, there's a huge, at least 20 minute long fight scene at the climax of the film, and then it's over. Wonder Woman isn't that far off from this, but I found it to be entertaining, well directed, and well rounded. Gal Gadot was great as Wonder Woman, and Chris Pine was good too. The death of his character was done well and had nice emotional payoff. The story moved along at a good pace and had a few great moments of character development thrown in as well. The cinematography was very good, as was the score.<br/><br/>While Wonder Woman isn't amazing, it's a solid film that's entertaining, well made, and that has a good story to it as well as well rounded characters. 7.5 out of 10"
"andrew_tdr","10","25","51","6 September 2017"," Very solid superhero movie, the best from DC yet
","Check the profiles of the users who rated this 1/10. Most of them are fake accounts who only have that 1 star review. Do you know why? Because the main actor in this movie is a woman. Simple as that. Pathetic.<br/><br/>Now on to the movie. This is the best movie we got from DC so far in my opinion for two main reasons: editing and writing. Almost all scenes are meaningful and serve to advance the plot. Scenes don't just happen like in BvS (which I hated) and Suicide Squad. It's well paced, the action is amazing and there's never a dull moment. I think Gal Gadot works really well as Wonder Woman. She really nailed the fish out of the water feeling, in part due to her English and accent. Chris Pine also did a good job. I enjoyed seeing them together on the screen. I believe they have real chemistry. However, this movie is not without its flaws. The worst part is easily the main villain and the very last fight. I won't go into details but I wish they did a better job there. That's my only real complaint.<br/><br/>Overall, I honestly believe you will enjoy this movie. Good editing and fun action."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","9","25","51","31 May 2017"," Wonder Gal shows Batfleck and Neck-snapper how it's done...
","We begin with Diana regaining possession of that old photo of her she so eagerly wanted in BvS, then flashback to Princess Diana as a child who yearns to be like the rest of the Amazons of Themyscira. Her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), is hesitant/hiding something from her, but eventually allows her sister/Diana's aunt, Antiope (Robin Wright), to train her to be better than the rest of the Amazons. She proves herself to be just that and so much more. After Diana rescues Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), whose crashed plane from World War I penetrated Themyscira's shield/cloak, their two worlds collide. Once Steve's subjected to the Lasso of Truth (Pine's equal parts amusing/utterly believable when under its influence), Diana's convinced the Amazons' old enemy, Ares the God of War, is behind 'the war' Steve speaks of and is determined to help the world of man.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman was the stand-out in BvS, and proves the skeptics incorrect about that simply being a 'fluke' due to her limited screen-time. This movie rests on her shoulders, and Gadot proves more than up to the task of portraying Diana as brave/courageous/intelligent/'badass' and, most of all, deeply empathetic/compassionate (not just regarding people, but animals too). She radiates warmth and her performance is, at times, heartbreaking (especially during the really emotional scenes). Gadot also has good comedic timing/delivery of lines (like when she discovers ice cream) and is just so likable, endearingly earnest, but genuine. Everything a hero *should* be (unlike other certain so-called 'superheroes').<br/><br/>Pine's Steve is far more likable than his Kirk. He does a lot with what could've been a thankless role and, like Diana, Steve proves himself a hero. He helps Diana adjust to being in a new world, teaching/explaining things to her, but is never condescending. Both actors 'click', especially in the boat scene when leaving Themyscira. They have an easy chemistry; their banter is fun and Steve/Diana's respective fish-out-of-water scenarios allow for some amusing moments without verging into silliness. They respect each other, neither one is ever portrayed 'negatively' to 'prop up' the other (even when they argue), and it's one of the only comic book movie romantic pairings (that's been developed over the course of just one movie) which I've found truly believable/has actually had any emotional impact.<br/><br/>Steve's secretary, Etta Candy, also provides some humour, though thankfully isn't too annoying. She takes an instant liking to Diana (you can see why) and Diana respects her in return. See, other comic cook movies? Mutual respect between characters isn't THAT hard! Steve's other trusted reinforcements only get small amounts of screen-time, but each feel like fully-developed/proper characters with depth/flaws. The camaraderie that forms between them and Diana is earned/believable, bringing real 'heart' to the story.<br/><br/>On the villains' side there's Danny Huston's Ludendorff, who Diana believes to be Ares, thus providing Diana with an adversary she can beat up/someone you really want to see her kick the arse of. Even better, though, is Elena Anaya as Doctor Maru aka 'Doctor Poison' (she and Ludendorff make a truly twisted pair, with a sick sense of humour that at least makes them more memorable than the typical comic book villains). I've been impressed with Anaya's previous work, and she conveys so much whilst acting with half her face behind a mask. In a scene she shared with Steve, I even felt for her (Pine does well here too). I appreciated the moment between her character and Diana near the end, and that it didn't go quite the way one might've expected.<br/><br/>While the Amazons are only in the beginning of the movie, they still make a strong impression. Witnessing them in action is quite something to behold. Despite Hippolyta and Diana often disagreeing/arguing with each other, Gal Gadot and Connie Nielsen completely sell the love their characters feel for each other (as well as ALL the Amazons). At first David Thewlis feels underutilized as Sir Patrick, who helps Diana/Steve, but later on shares a scene with Diana through a window that I thought was visually interesting.<br/><br/>The music throughout the film packs an emotional punch, and those complaining about 'overuse' of the awesomely memorable 'Wonder Woman Theme' (which we got a taste of in BvS and this film's trailers) need to hush, as it's only used sparingly/at the RIGHT times, mostly during the epic fight scenes (proving almost as 'iconic' as the 'Superman Theme'). Speaking of, this movie gives us something *different* with the hero's style of fighting. Her use of sword, shield, bullet-deflecting bracelets, as well as the Lasso of Truth, makes for some stunning/inventive action sequences.<br/><br/>Regarding complaints of 'too much CGI' during the climax, given who was fighting who and the power at their disposal, the effects on display were justified. The Wonder Woman costume doesn't get enough credit for being true to the comic whilst also being functional/non-gratuitous/non-exploitative (no star-spangled panties here). The first time she shows it off in the 'No Man's Land' sequence is very memorable. Not only is it one of the movie's best scenes, but it also deserves to be right up there alongside the first time Superman saves Lois as far as immediately 'iconic' (there's that word again) sequences go. Diana's other costumes are also gorgeous, as is Themyscira ('Paradise Island' indeed). The film feels like a classic action/adventure movie. It's well-paced, has plenty of heart, and is indeed one of the best comic book movies in LONG time.<br/><br/>Naturally, it'll have its detractors/nitpickers, but this is one movie where the hype is warranted/to be believed. It's everything I've been waiting for/wanting to see in a superhero movie for so long. This isn't just easily the best DCEU movie so far, nor is it simply an excellent superhero movie, it's also a triumph for the first big screen adaptation of Wonder Woman and an enthralling cinema-going experience/one of the best movies in recent memory. Everyone involved with this film should feel proud/pat themselves on the back for this accomplishment."
"shawneofthedead","9","25","51","31 May 2017"," The wait was worth it. Wonder Woman is fantastic – full of all the heart, hope and humour that Diana deserves.
","Right out of the starting gate, Wonder Woman has had to bear the burden of great expectations – a burden her male compatriots, from Batman and Superman to Spider-Man, have been spared. Her comic-book history, dating from 1941, is no less long and illustrious, but this is the first feature film starring Diana of Themyscira to have made it out of development hell. Get it wrong, and Diana's legacy falters and fails. Somewhat unfairly, the film is also expected to serve as the litmus test for all female-led blockbuster movies from now till the end of time (Can Women Do ACTION?!?!) while saving the critically savaged DC Extended Universe (DCEU) from itself. No big deal.<br/><br/>It's truly wonderful, then, that Wonder Woman doesn't just meet these expectations – it surpasses them. As a film, it's an unequivocal delight. There's so much here that's fresh and intelligent and beautifully done, from its proud feminism and rich character work to jaw-dropping action sequences, that it's easy to forgive a few third-act woes. In a franchise hitherto characterised by misery and man-pain, where the 'heroes' aren't necessarily better than the humans they're supposed to save, Diana arrives as a pure adrenaline shot of heart, humour and hope.<br/><br/>We first meet Diana (Gal Gadot) in Themyscira, a secluded island paradise cut off from the outside world. Here, Diana is safe, sheltered by her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen); trained by General Antiope (Robin Wright); and protected by a tribe of warrior women known as the Amazons. But everything changes when American spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) literally crashes into her life, bringing with him war, death and the fate of mankind. Convinced that Ares, the Greek god of war, has returned to wreak havoc on Earth, Diana leaves her home to fight for humanity – ordinary, selfish, sometimes downright terrible people who may not deserve her as a champion.<br/><br/>On its own merits, Wonder Woman is a rip-roaring adventure from start to (mostly) finish. Audiences are swept along for the ride as Diana, still learning the true extent of her formidable powers, storms through Europe and World War I. There are fisticuffs in London alleyways, and a rousing charge through No Man's Land in German-occupied Belgium.<br/><br/>But, while there's plenty of spectacle on display, the film also takes are to show us the relationships that make Diana who she is and who she will become: from the women who guided and inspire her, to the men who give her reason to defend the world when it seems broken beyond repair.<br/><br/>In particular, there's a beautiful give-and-take to the way Diana and Steve dance – literally and metaphorically – with each other. He shows her the world; she shows him the hope she has for it. There's a touch of rose-coloured naivete to the way Diana navigates the conflict raging around them, but neither Steve nor the audience thinks less of her for that. Instead, he learns and grows with her – as does she, with him.<br/><br/>If there are still naysayers left after her striking debut as Diana in Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice, Gadot's performance in Wonder Woman should shut them up for good. She looks the part, of course – you'll believe she can really fly, dodge bullets, and hoist tanks above her head. But she also lends her character plenty of heart and charm, making Diana achingly relatable and human. Gadot is funny, too, as she navigates an unfamiliar world where everything tries to convince her that she's less than who she really is. (Spoiler: it doesn't work.) She shares a sweet, lovely chemistry with Pine, who's evidently game for anything, including some rather welcome casual objectification.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that Wonder Woman is only Patty Jenkins' second film as a director. Not only is it completely different from her indie art-house debut, Monster, Wonder Woman is a properly huge blockbuster that juggles action and comedy beats with confident flair. Jenkins choreographs Amazons tumbling through the sky, loosing arrows and swords with deadly precision, as well as she handles tiny moments of human connection – from Diana discovering the magic of ice cream, to snow drifting down from the heavens as music plays and life, for a moment, seems perfect.<br/><br/>That's not to say everything about the film works. The final third is strangely messy, as plot points start to crash into one another and Diana's true nemesis emerges. Uncoincidentally, it's at more or less the exact point when Wonder Woman starts to look and feel more like the rest of the DCEU. Diana's defining showdown – full of CGI, fire, explosions and shouting – loses a great deal of the depth and nuance that worked so well before. (Heads-up: you might also find yourself asking, 'Why did you do that, Steve Trevor? Why?!?!') Jenkins still manages to tap into the emotional core of the moment, but a few canny script tweaks might have held everything together better.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Wonder Woman remains a remarkable achievement by practically any measure. As a superhero film, it's a sublime blast of fun. As a film made for, about and by women, it's every bit as smart, capable and inspiring as its lead character – an empowering gem that will now belong to anyone who's ever loved or been a little girl. As the latest entry in the struggling DCEU, it's easily the best installment yet, bringing hope and wonder into a universe too grim and dark for its own good. And, as a comic-book adaptation, it does justice to Diana's roots, blending origins old and New 52 in a way that should please fans of all generations.<br/><br/>In short? It's a home run – and thank god for that!"
"classicalsteve","9","22","44","19 June 2017"," The Feminist Icon Becomes A Message Against War In Oustanding Superhero Film
","Wonder Woman was not created by Aphrodite or Zeus, but was rather the brain-child of a controversial psychologist and inventor, William Moulton Marston. (Marston's other claim to fame is the invention of the lie detector.) Although Superman and Batman were selling well to kids, there was a wave of pseudo-psychology which claimed that comic books were poisoning the minds of impressionable youths. Detective Comics (later renamed DC) were frightened that these radical groups were influencing the voting public which might hire lawmakers to ban comic books altogether. DC hired Marston to address this problem. Rather than changing existing comic books, Marston offered an unexpected solution: make a female superhero, i.e. a super-heroine. The result was Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Little did DC comics know Marston had been involved in the early suffragette and birth-control movements of the early 20th century, and he incorporated much of the iconography and symbolism into the comic book. Wonder Woman's looks was originally a hybrid of the Varga pin-up girl posters of the 1940's and Suffragettes of the early 20th century. For example, Wonder Woman's early adventures often involved her being chained, an icon used by feminists and suffragettes in the early 20th century in propaganda posters and political illustrations. When chained, Wonder Woman loses her powers. Her magic lasso compels the person being lassoed to tell the truth, an obvious reference to Marston's lie detector. The comic was an instant hit and even became iconic for the Women's Liberation Movement of the 1970's.<br/><br/>Fast-forward to 2017. Patty Jenkins has directed an outstanding film on a screenplay by Allan Heinberg from a story by Heinberg, Zack Snyder and Jason Fuchs based on the DC Comics character. Starring Gal Gadot as the title character and Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, this superhero action film flies as fusing of Ancient mythology and human history, and the offering is one of the best of the genre since the original ""Superman"" film starring Christopher Reeve (1979). Like ""Superman"", ""Wonder Woman"" begins with the backstory of the title character. Her name is Diana, daughter of Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nelson) and she lives on Paradise Island where only women reside whose culture is a throw-back to Ancient Greek mythology. (Paradise because there are no men to screw things up...?) Diana as a youth is taught by the best combat teacher of the island, General Antiope (Robin Wright) in the ways of combat and becomes the best among her peers.<br/><br/>Sticking to the origins, Captain Steve Trevor, an American spy working for the British, is being chased by Germans during the First World War and crashes off the coast of Paradise Island. He has in his possession plans written by Dr. Poison (a real character from DC Comics). After a confrontation between Amazons and the Germans, Trevor is taken in by the Amazons and forced to reveal who and what he is. Eventually, Diana decides she must go with Trevor back to ""the world of men"" and help stop the war. Her reasons are mythological in which she must stop the ""God of War"". Of course Trevor doesn't buy into Diana's myth story but plays along to get back to the war. They sail by boat back to London.<br/><br/>One of the best sequences is Diana's introduction to early 20th century society. Gadot offers an excellent performance as the slightly culture-shocked fish-out-of-water but never overplays it. She tries on a pouffe dress which definitely wouldn't be ""Wonder Woman"". Eventually, she dons a suitable outfit and signs onto a mission with Trevor and several marginal characters to stop a fatal gas attack which makes the mustard gas of the war seem like the steam from a sauna. The inventor is Doctor Isabel Maru, a.k.a. Dr. Poison who has been supported by General Ludendorff. (In fact Ludendorff was a real general in the First World War and was involved in Hitler's so-called Beer Hall Putsch to overthrow the German government in 1923.) The mission is not sanctioned by the war office of London but in secret with only one member of Parliament offering assistance, Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis). This merry band of misfits, a woman who knows nothing about western society and culture, a Scottish drunk, a Native American pacifist, an Italian actor, and an American spy make their way to the front lines of the First World War.<br/><br/>An outstanding film all around with excellent performances and a good balance between story and action. The filmmakers made the decision to withhold Diana becoming ""Wonder Woman"" until nearly half-way into the film, similar to ""Superman"". One of the best decisions: she never says ""I'm Wonder Woman"". A superhero speaking his or her name is a fatal screenplay error made by many other screenwriters who shall remain nameless."

The direction from Petty Jenkins works well, the pace builds after a nice set up, it looks great and the WW1 setting gives the plot some depth and context.

","It goes without saying that dark comedy is very difficult to accomplish. I would almost say it's harder to pull off than regular comedy because you need to be able to keep people invested in the dramatic aspect of the film, while still keeping them laughing throughout the majority of the duration. Director Martin McDonagh has matured as a filmmaker over the years, starting off with In Bruges, which was pretty much a flat-out comedy, to Seven Psychopaths, which placed him a little further into the spotlight, but I must admit that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is not only his best film to date, but also one of the best films I've received the pleasure of witnessing all year. From laughter to genuine tension and heart, this is a film that's pretty much perfect all around. Here is why I can recommend this film to everyone.<br/><br/>After the tragic death of her daughter, Mildred Hayes calls out the local authorities on three billboards, publicly stating that they're not doing their jobs and not a single arrest has happened since the death of her daughter. While publicly displaying this is upsetting to some, she sees it as a point being made. Through some very cleverly written humor throughout the entire film, levity is brought to the table in times of sorrow, making this a very easy movie to watch. Although the story itself is quite depressing, this film is written in a way that will still find a way to make you smile."
"MasterFantastic","10","9","15","19 September 2017"," Good, not great, but fun overall. Spoilers are here, though...
","Overall, a very solid flick, fun, clever in spots, with a terrific musical score--Junkie XL ought to get a special nod at the Oscars for his 'battle music'--Wonder Woman has finally made it to the big screen in her own origin movie.<br/><br/>The action starts on Themyscira, the early days of Diana's life as a child and then as a young warrioress, her entrance into man's world, and her battles which shape her as the superheroine she will become.<br/><br/>Pluses of this film are many. The interplay between Diana and Steve (solidly acted by Chris Pine) is good on its own, with a couple of well-placed jabs on males being needed for the essentials in life (babies) while not being there for pleasure. That went over the heads of a lot of people, but whatever.<br/><br/>The action is solid. Yes, the final battle sequence is a tad too long, and some of the CGI is a bit cheesy, but still, decent. As mentioned above, the music is excellent, the acting solid by the leads as well as the supporting cast, and the feminist angle is mentioned, but not bludgeoned to death.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the relationship between Gadot and Pine. Like many, I thought her too skinny for the role when I heard about Batman versus Superman, but was pleasantly surprised by her appearance. Yes, she could have been a bit more muscular, but these things take time. As it is, she put on about sixteen pounds and looked good enough. She does have a somewhat flat voice, but used her wide-eyed expression to good advantage.<br/><br/>Chris Pine has also never been known for his range, but here he excelled. He and Ms. Gadot seemed to be having fun with their roles, and the rest of the cast seemed to be having fun as well.<br/><br/>The direction was solid. Patty Jenkins is not known for her command of action scenes, yet she did a decent job. The slo-mo was employed a few times too often, but it worked more often than not, so there it is.<br/><br/>Now, for the negatives. Sorry, they have to be stated. While origin stories do demand exposition, it went on for too long. I think it could have been cut down somewhat. Did we need all that? Did we need to see the buildup to the battle scenes so drawn out? That could have been somewhat tighter.<br/><br/>I also had a problem with no one mentioning Charlie's shell-shock too much. It's shown when he's sleeping--nightmares--but nothing more than that. (Spoiler) Then there's the battle with General Ludendorff; it doesn't make a lot of sense. He inhales a 'supergas' which increases his strength, but really, he almost bests Diana in their fight, and she should be able to tear right through him, but doesn't.<br/><br/>In spite of these deficiencies, Wonder Woman gives DC's first female superhero a chance to shine, and shine she does. People can quibble all they like about the setting being WWI instead of WWII--as in the comic books. They can compare WW to Captain America, and there are some similarities, yes. But overall, Wonder Woman showed that DC can make decent action flicks AND present a solid message. They did that with Wonder Woman."
"sindyabreu","5","27","56","10 July 2017"," Another fail for DC Comics...
","This movie had a great idea that was horribly developed, same problem with other movies from DC Comics.<br/><br/>Characters with no purpose and badly developed, you never even get to understand some of these characters by the end of the movie. To many holes in the plot, a lot of things just don't make sense. Even the ""romance"" in the movie just seemed rushed and forced.<br/><br/>I think DC Comics needs to start focusing on elaborating their stories and characters, they give too much thought to special effects (only good thing about this movie), so the plot ends up being a confusing, inaccurate, cheesy, ridiculous mess.<br/><br/>I am actually surprised that Patty Jenkins directed this, I love The Killing and Monster (both masterpieces), but this movie has some disappointing directing."

It seems you either have to be super edgy (DC's BvS and Suicide Squad), or super goofy/sarcastic (Marvel Movies)... but Wonder Woman has found a way to navigate those awful waters and find what makes superhero films so great - the same way Richard Donner did with ""Superman"" 1978. <br/><br/>So don't bother listening to haters - this film is a once in a generation flick, that resurrects the feeling of joy and optimism at the idea that there are ""superhumans"" and ""superheroes"" out there saving the day. <br/><br/>Wonderful flick - and best CBM since ""The Dark Knight"" (Possibly ever - alongside Superman 1978). 10/10!"

"damionis","9","18","35","3 June 2017"," Beyond (Gender) Expectations
","The moment Diana Prince took her first spear tackle at evil in Batman Vs Superman threw a gauntlet at the feet of an entire generation of older movie-goers who's lingering impression of Wonder Woman was a soft, curvaceous and inherently feminine Linda Carter of the seventies. Spinning magic girl transformations have been replaced with a monstrous power that frankly woke me up in my seat. She was my lingering impression and my first taste of a DC that left me wanting more.<br/><br/>The Wonder Woman role has big shoes to fill and sadly the shoes themselves will give her a scrutiny male counterparts are not burdened with. Will they be sensible shoes, combat boots or heels? Gal Gadot's counter-argument is a role that is strong, personal and honest. Her tremendous power is counterbalanced with a naivety that reaches beyond comic relief into an often scathing critique of the human leanings toward inhumanity. She reminds us of a bigger picture by becoming a passionate observer of our frailty and in doing so, often exposes her own while retaining all of her strength. In this regard the role of Wonder Woman is an unprecedented success as she struggles to find herself as a person rather than her role as a female superhero.<br/><br/>Although aspects of female gender roles are present they develop in other characters. The mother, the amazon, the witch, the submissive - all present as people rather than stereotypes and the roster of strong performances delivers with a confidence that define these women with substance and a dignified strength while avoiding becoming lessons or cautionary tales in femininity.<br/><br/>I feel it as important to note that the male characters in this movie also avoid the same gender stereotypes. The men who marginalize her share the same disregard for all life. The men who initially sought to protect her - as we are taught to by our mothers and sisters - quickly fall behind her and support her strength. She is never forced to explain herself.<br/><br/>In a genre filled with movies about other movies or stories that build momentum for bigger stories to come it's refreshing to see a movie that delivers a strong tale, genuinely warm characters and manages to embarrass us with the lesson that genuinely strong and honest characters make our gender expectations irrelevant."
"TroliusMaximus","3","36","78","17 July 2017"," Woeful Woman
","To quote a popular Internet Age meme: WHAT THE F*** DID I JUST WATCH?! More pertinently: WHY IS THIS FILM BEING (i) SHILLED FOR, AND (ii) WHY DOES IT GARNER AVERAGE SCORES IN THE HIGH 7's HERE AT IMDb AND 90%+ AT RT...?!<br/><br/>I never before thought much of the whole ""feminazi"" or ""SJW"" conspiratorial take on how social engineering is said to be taking place―through the agency of entertainment, its content and subsequent promotion. However, 'Wonder Woman' has caused this reviewer to stop and take pause. For this film is one, woeful pile of garbage (even in the context of a comic book schlock), that should be given a Razzie for its crimes against the filmic medium; not garner ridiculously unwarranted praise.<br/><br/>From its horrid casting and barely passable acting (was Gal Gadot away sick during the 'acting module' of her JIDF training tenure?), to its amateurish stunt work and ensuing overuse of CGI effects―necessitated in an attempt to futilely smear over the the film's said substandard chop-socky / pew-pew sequences―Wonder Woman is one of the worst, if not THE worst comic book film I have ever had the displeasure of running afoul of.<br/><br/>From go to wow, the film is an aural and visual 'turd de faeces'. There is so little to redeem a film like this, that one must wonder what was going through the minds of those who crafted it: Did they watch the dailies? Did the actors have any input in the creative process, whatsoever? Was it all ""green screened""...? Surely this was all filmed blind... blind drunk, that is!<br/><br/>Even for those pushing the film as an empowering vehicle for female actors ― they have very little to grasp at here. The male ""co-star"" (Chris Pine) is given the bulk of the film's der-dumb dialogue; thus, insultingly relegating the titular character to playing second fiddle. So much so, in fact, that for most part, Gadot's role arguably fails the very 'Bechdel test' the film (and those who champion it) strove to emancipate the yoke of. Of course, this must all be tempered with what the director and screen-writers had at their disposal (with respect to acting clout), which was patently very, very little (*assuming the drivel was not all spouted ad libitum ― a suggestion not as fanciful as it might normally seem).<br/><br/>In short: The dialogue was stilted. The interactions wooden. Obligatory ""love"" sceNE (*singular), ham-fistedly shoehorned and cringe-worthy to bear. Little character development to speak of. Barely a thread of connection was established between viewer and the characters they were meant to invest in. The acting was sub par, at best... A literal failure on every, objective, filmic measure. Even rusted-on Wonder Woman fans would struggle to find tenable arguments for the existence of this film, in the egregious form that it has been rendered.<br/><br/>I normally do not write reviews for films of this shabby stock--in any capacity. However, given the hubbub surrounding 'Wonder Woman' and its association with ""the women's movement"", I felt compelled to throw my 2¢ worth into this well of bubbling, fetid waste. For I feel we must speak out against blatant shilling for that which patently does not deserve it on merit; and we must fight against the inclination to 'grade on a curve', that has gripped our societies since the advent of the Internet.<br/><br/>Moreover, the 'process factory' structure that the industry applies to the production of films in this genre, all but guarantees one schlock after another. These films are clearly produced only to make money. As such ― given money inherently corrupts all that it comes into contact with ― the end results are fait accompli. This is not a propitious philosophical model, nor a mindset anyone should advocate for.<br/><br/>This race to the bottom, which we are embarked upon, does a disservice, not only to the art form, but also to wider culture and society.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is not the female-helmed comic book film you were looking for. Move on."
"smileyyanny97","8","21","42","6 June 2017"," Great Hero, Great Movie, Great Return
","Wonder Woman is great! When the first trailer was released I was quite pumped already. I've always liked Wonder Woman and it was great to finally see her in the silver screen with today's effects and all.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a great hero. She's strong, intuitive, and tough while still being both compassionate and kind which was essential to her original character; and this movie keeps true to that. Diana in this movie has those same characters and Gal Dadot's performance was very believable.<br/><br/>The movie is essentially an origin story which can be hit or miss. The DC Extended Universe movies have not been well received at all, but more on this later. The movie's color scheme is quite clever, showing the island Diana grew up on as a very bright and beautiful with everything outside of it being dark and dreary. It captures the intensity and grit of war, especially the time it takes place in, World War I. There's even a scene where they go into the trenches and it's quite authentic. There isn't a single filler character, even the side characters of the group of soldiers she links up with are entertaining and add a lot of flavor to the movie. My only nitpick is that the music seemed all over the place.<br/><br/>This is also a great return for DC movies. As I mentioned before recent DC movies, such as ""Man of Steel"", ""Batman V Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"" (a movie I actually liked for just how fun it was) weren't greatly reciprocated and for good reasons. But ""Wonder Woman"" nails everything that DC movies in the past were great: balancing comedy and intensity. The movie doesn't have that many comedic moments towards the end but it does have that balance very well in the beginning and the movie benefits because of it.<br/><br/>In the end, I highly recommend this film. I feel that it's one most people should enjoy, especially those who have been disappointed by DC movies over the past couple of movies."

","One word: WONDERful. Wonder Woman came to save the DCEU. It is a truly perfect film, a round movie from beginning to end that has its closure. It's even one of the best movies ever made. As the story goes many years before the other films doesn't need to leave loose ends or references to connect them with the rest of the universe. The origin is counted in the first half hour; in the island of Themyscira the scenes are quite colorful with a very beautiful tone, unlike what we were showing the previous films, although the plot is short and the characters don't appear much; Antiope (Robin Wright) is spectacular & Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) also does a good job. When England is shown the colors become tenuous (by the tone of the war) engaging the rest of movies; Diana (Gal Gadot) & Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) make an excellent dynamic duo, with good chemistry, charisma and companionship, have a kind of romance & complicity: pure dynamite. The dynamic reminds us of Richard Donner & Christopher Reeve's Superman, the serious drama tone to Tim Burton & Michael Keaton's Batman. Ludendorff (Danny Huston) is a transitional German villain for the plot but it's necessary; Doctor Poison (Helena Anaya) works as a villain, & the final fight with the hidden villain, Ares, is good but it lasts a very short time. If Patty removes that plot, the film stands alone because Diana fighting the Germans is delightful. The tape has a truly altruistic heroism & heart; Justice, freedom & hope; What Man Of Steel should have been. Excellent action scenes, very good choreography and very good production work. The soundtrack is exciting."

","Wonder Woman is one of the best movies in 2017 and by far the most successful. The movie is about Diana, who was raised by the Amazons on the island, Themyscira, and although her mother, Queen Hippolyta, disagrees, she trains to fight with the other warriors. One day however, a plane crashes offshore and Diana, seeing this, dives into the water and rescues the pilot, Steve Trevor. However, soon after, German ships come to the island in pursuit of Trevor. The Germans were killed, but Antiope, Hippolyta's sister and Diana's trainer, was killed protecting Diana from a bullet. Later, Steve and Diana leave the island in order to end the war and protect humanity from Ares. When arriving in Britain, it is found out that the British are negotiating an armistice with the Germans, but the notebook stolen by the spy Steve Trevor reveals that the Germans have developed a stronger and more potent form of mustard gas and plan to release it at the Western Front. Against the orders of his superiors, Trevor, along with Diana, head to the war front in Belgium, and Diana was able to enter ""No Man's Land"" and captures the German trenches. In the final battle scene between Ares and Diana, Steve, on the other hand, pilots the plane loaded with the deadly gas and sacrifices himself in order to protect everyone else. Diana defeats Ares and then we return to present day, where Diana is a curator of a museum and received a picture of Steve Trevor, her, and her companions during the war from Bruce Wayne, recruiting her to join him in defending the world once again from a new threat.<br/><br/>This movie is worthwhile to watch as it is one of only good superhero movies DC has released in a while. With a budget of $149 million, the film has grossed over $820 worldwide in box office sales. The development of the romantic relationship between Diana and Steve is heartwarming and the pain that Diana feels when Steve sacrifices himself is devastating, even causing me to tear up a bit when watching. This movie is the best superhero origin story. Seeing Diana develop as a character from being a naive child into hero who is kind and has a strong sense of righteousness, while protecting the innocents of the world and defeating the evil in the world. The change in her environment from an island paradise to the modern city of London is quite apparent, and Diana clearly doesn't fit in because she lacks the ""modern common sense"". The soundtrack of Wonder Woman was vey powerful and exhilirating to listen to. Especially the song being played during the battle scene in the tower and all that slow motion going on was just the best scene in the entire movie.<br/><br/>After reading some other reviews of Wonder Woman on IMDB, I was greatly offended by some losers who just try to find the smallest of faults in a movie and can't just enjoy it for Christ's sake. Although everyone is entitled to their own opinion, sometimes, they should just keep it to themselves, because their opinions are just plain wrong. One loser by the name of jsnaps098 says that there isn't any character development at all, and I instead think that Diana indeed does grow from a young, naive child into someone who sees the wrong in this world and does something about it. Anyway, I just can't find any fault in this movie because the final scene in which Steve Trevor flies off in the plane carrying the bomb and Diana is just crying her heart out. This scene just pulled so hard on my heart strings.<br/><br/>Overall, Wonder Woman is a must-watch movie, not only because of its captivating story of a young lady discovering her role in the world and what it means to be a hero, but also the love between two people who've been together through thick and thin and how loss can completely devastate someone. For anyone who has yet to see this amazing piece of artwork, it is available for purchase on most online streaming services as well as for subscribers of HBO Now, although you could probably watch it for free from some sketchy Russian website."

","I'm glad they finally brought Wonder Woman to the big screen. I became a fan of Wonder Woman when I watched the Lynda Cater version on TV as a kid. Wonder Woman sure has come a long way. I just love the costume they made for her, it's militaristic yet still feminine. And Gal Gadot rocks in the role, she's hot (for one thing!) and projects a lot of strength and courage. There is non-stop excitement in this film! The action scenes are amazing, but I'm glad they found time to squeeze in some character building in between the awesome fights scenes. I like how Wonder Woman is like a fish out of water when she first arrives in industrialized 1918 London. I found it interesting that they set the story during World War I instead of World War II. Though I wish they explained how on Earth can the Amazons speak English when they have cloistered themselves in Themiscyra for thousands of years and English did not even exist before they took refuge on the island. A great blockbuster movie overall, if you are a Wonder Woman fan or a fan of super heroes (or heroines) in general, you will enjoy this movie!"

I learned that inside every one of them, there will always be both. The choice each must make for themselves - something no hero will ever defeat. I've touched the darkness that lives in between the light. Seen the worst of this world, and the best. Seen the terrible things men do to each other in the name of hatred, and the lengths they'll go to for love. Now I know. Only love can save this world. So I stay. I fight, and I give... for the world I know can be. This is my mission, now. Forever."""

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8","7","11","8 March 2019"," A wonderful film that draws too many comparisons.
","Wonder Woman (2017) is a triumphant movie that shows the comic book genre doesn't have to be dominated by men. Unfortunately, because it took so long getting here, I can't help but draw comparisons to other works that came before it, making Wonder Woman seem derivative. In fact, had this movie come out eight years ago, it would have made Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and Thor (2011) look like they were copying it. As it stands, though, Wonder Woman feels formulaic, even if the superhero is a woman instead of a man.<br/><br/>I will grant that some of the jokes come at the expense of the ""fish out of water"" character of Diana (Gal Gadot), playing on her naïveté of the ""modern world"" for laughs (a la Thor) but with a more sexualized context because she's a woman. There were a few missed opportunities to add depth to the character via these circumstances, the interaction with Chief Napi (Eugene Brave Rock) being one of them (as the Amazons and the Blackfoot tribe were likely very isolated from each other). Either way, the levity helped to break up the incredible action sequences.<br/><br/>The action sequences in Wonder Woman served a few purposes, both of which helped develop the titular character. The acrobatic style of the Amazons looks a little ridiculous when they're fighting each other, but thoroughly brutal when they're fighting anyone else. While she dominated on the battlefield, showing that she could conquer ""no man's land"" (an apt observation of her gender), when she struggled against the main antagonist of the film, her vulnerability made her a much more interesting character. After all, it's tiresome to see an overpowered character with no obstacles to slow them down. That being said, I think the film could have gone in an interesting direction if the antagonist got away since most superhero movies end with the hero winning.<br/><br/>A wonderful film that draws too many comparisons, I give Wonder Woman 4.0 stars out of 5."

"selep","1","23","47","13 July 2017"," Garbage, boring movie
","This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Long, slow, boring, people talking and talking and the most cringeworthy excuse for 'comedy' I've seen. It's as if everyone involved gave up and lazily slapped together a final product. I wouldn't be this critical if people didn't praise it so much, calling it the best superhero movie ever. Please.<br/><br/>It's got a terrible lead, bad acting (Chris Pine does his best but even then he looks embarrassed to be there, he went from Captain Kirk to a glorified poolboy and now he's stuck in this role for life), awful romance with negative chemistry, story that makes no sense, 90% of the female cast gets replaced with dudes which is supposed to empower women (has that air of ""only this hot bland doe-eyed white woman is good, no other women matter.) Terrible effects, they were so bad that I thought they were the funniest parts of the movie. Horrible villains, they were cartoon characters. Really clichéd, repetitive writing, it was like a first draft of a scrip that no one bothered to look over. It's frustrating hearing people talk about it all the time, at least my friends and I agreed, coming out of the theater, that it was a waste of money and time and we should have left when Diana, so empowered and groundbreaking feminist figure, began making out with the first dude she met after knowing him for 2 days. It makes me cringe thinking that girls are using this farce of a relationship as 'marriage goals' and they'll copy WW by dressing in her skimpy skintight outfit (I compare her outfit to Batman and Superman's outfits, covered from head to toe, and it makes me sad how at the blatant sexism everyone else ignores.)<br/><br/>This is NOT a good feminist movie. It's not even a good movie. It's a slow-motion shiny Pantene commercial with ugly kissing, bad jokes (if you want to count Steve stuttering as a joke), terribly written characters (nobody aside from Steve had a personality or logical character arc, nearly every was a bunch of random traits slapped together) and a weird message (""love is what conquers war"" *Diana murders a bunch of people and the bad guy and that is supposed to be empowering* - then we infer that she sat out of World War 2, what did she do just sit around crying about Steve for 100 years? Yeah that's.... feminist and progressive.)<br/><br/>It does make me feel better that the IMDb score is dropping and more people are less afraid to call out the flaws of this movie. One of the worst wastes of time, do not watch this trash."
"affnafeerahman","1","23","47","13 July 2017"," Overrated and very, very disappointing
","Being an avid comic book fan and a massive fan of the Wonder Woman character, I can honestly say I was really disappointed how the movie turned out. The character development was basically rubbish- we see how she becomes a hero with no struggle to understand the world, responsibility or the true meaning and worth to truly become what we can call hero. Which is why it felt very abrupt and sudden how the character unravels to become the hero she becomes. There were so MANY holes in the story that were totally inexcusable: 1. Her whole journey is kind of based on a hunch that Antiope has- Ares still exists 2. What's wrong if she does know she is the God-Killer? 3. If her mother know she is the God-Killer, why refuse to train her? 4. Had Steve Trevor not arrived was there really a way to know that Ares lives and substantiate the hunch that Antiope had 5. Why would Hippolyta not let her come back? 6. Where were all the companions of Steve Trevor when WW was fighting Ares? the whole place was literally hell and in the end they just appear from under a metal sheet. 7. Wonder Woman is very strong and can jump great heights- why then let Trevor die instead of just throwing it towards the sky? And so many more... The CGI was absolutely preposterous, the whole story (if her childhood is discarded) unravels in the matter of a few days (and that didn't help adding depth to the character development), relentlessly long backstory that's just monotonous and does no good to help the plot in anyway. Huge casting error when it comes to Ares' character. Gal Gadot is a great actor no doubt but one can point out her inability to develop the American accent which is why every Amazon had to learn to speak the way she naturally does. <br/><br/>I have no idea what the hype is all about, it was a below par movie by all standards despite the great performances by Gal and Chris. Again, very heartbroken!"
"saoroy","1","23","47","27 June 2017"," Mediocre Film that's worth a buck sixty on Redbox
","Wonder Woman is a solid Redbox rental. That is all.<br/><br/>I will elaborate. Slow, cliché driven, anti climatic and over all transparent. I saw nothing of it before sitting in the theater. The big reveal, ARES, was obvious from the tone and setting of his first scene.<br/><br/>They made the main reveals painfully clear from the onset. What set Diana apart from the other Amazons, Ares, a relationship predestined for a tragic end, all of it was instantly recognizable. No surprises, whatsoever.<br/><br/>There were numerous, poor attempts at humor. Which seems to be a trade mark for DC films.<br/><br/>I struggled to stay awake for the first half hour, until Diana snuck off with bae to the world of Man and even then, it had minimal entertainment value. <br/><br/>We watch Diana discover (and to her credit, Gal Gadot did make it seem more, or less, authentic) how the world was outside of the borders of her home land and fail to blend in. Though, ""blending in"" never seemed to be a high priority for her. She was SINGULARLY driven to kill ares. Which she did, very anti-climatically. Poor writing at it's finest. <br/><br/>Diana Prince is a very one dimensional character. Which, to be honest, embodies the whole mythos of Wonder Woman, perfectly. So, I am not sure I can use that as a detraction. As the character was faithfully represented.<br/><br/>Oh, and the on screen deaths of important characters were, more or less, pointless and apathetic. We had no reason to care for them, at all. Tertiary character development was even worse than for primary characters. Shakespeare, this was not.<br/><br/>I have more criticism, but it would be beating a dead horse after saying the characters are undeveloped, the movie is slow paced and the ending leaves much to be desired.<br/><br/>Now for the highlights.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot nailed the role. (and is gorgeous.)<br/><br/>The sometimes hokey CG and fight scenes don't really detract from the over all high quality of production for the film. It was certainly done well.<br/><br/>It was slightly more entertaining than Captain America: The First Avenger. Granted, that's not a high bar to jump, but if Cap can get 3 movies, I expect WW to get at least that many. (despite the lack luster first outing)<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is gorgeous! Did I already mention that? Oh well, it deserves to be said again. I spent more time entertained by close up shots of her face, than everything else combined.<br/><br/>Note: I found it funny that the entire Amazon race (those who spoke) had to learn Gal Gadot's accent, rather than simply teaching Gal Gadot to have an American accent. I suppose it had to be done, since she was already in BvS with the accent. However, with all the flaws of this film, picking on the accent seems petty. <br/><br/>Overall, it's a 6 out of 10. I will watch it again, but on red box. I only give it a 1 star rating, because many over hyped it and decided it was the best movie, ever and it certainly was not. Also Gal Gadot is incredibly gorgeous. Have I said that before? Ahhh, well...it can't be over stated."
"bitchard_black","8","17","33","7 March 2019"," An inspiration to all female led movies out there
","I am sorry for not writing a review when I saw the movie. I took it for granted. The industry seems to have gone to heck since 2017 with template movies and fast food filming styles which made me think about watching this movie again and I had my opinion confirmed, This movie has balanced story line with tastefully flashy entertainment and Gal Gadot has done an incredibly good job with the role.<br/><br/>This movie has so many layers to it, that i still stand impressed. The ""Venus vs. Mars"" clash, when the ideals and naivety of Wonder Woman clash with the reality and harshness of a war in a ""mans world"" and how they managed to fit all of this into such a great movie is beyond me.<br/><br/>I think two things have made this movie memorable for me:<br/><br/>1. Patty Jenkins and her direction in the movie.
2. Gal Gadot. I knew nothing of her, but what I know from human interactions, such emotions and elegance (like the one she showed in the movie) is not something that you can learn in acting classes. It is too genuine. From seeing the movie i knew she must have a lot of depth in reality as well and again, I stand impressed.<br/><br/>Con: David Thewlis is not Ares. Sadly to say, when he revealed himself people where slightly giggling in the cinema. He is a good actor, but he is not made for this role. Facial expressions might fit, but appearance and the lack of energy. Isn't Ares quick to anger? Quick to act? Revengeful and pity? He should have shown more physical action towards Gal Gadot.<br/><br/>In summary, I love this movie. I gave this movie an 8 because it still has some more smaller things that annoy and in the end.... super hero movies are no meant to be in the high 9-10 ratings. Just my opinion.<br/><br/>Worth every penny to see the movie once or twice! Buy it on Blue ray, rent it, buy the merch or just shout out to Gal Gadot for her awesome job. Just don't let this movie go unpraised. It is awesome :)"
"tavm","10","20","40","7 June 2017"," Wonder Woman was quite awesome as a female superhero movie!
","I first became familiar with Wonder Woman when watching the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series ""Superfriends"" on Saturday mornings on ABC. That network later aired a live action-version of her with Lynda Carter playing her during World War II. When CBS picked the series for a second season, the setting changed to present time. I've never read the Wonder Woman comics though I did read of her adventures in the All-Star Squadron comics during the '80s which depicted her Earth-2 (original Golden Age version) counterpart during WWII. All that I just mentioned were pretty enjoyable. As for this version, Gal Gadot certainly has both the beauty and body strength for the character. Chris Pine was also fine as her heroic partner-both in battle and love-Steve Trevor. Setting it during World War I was a nice change. The action was awesome and the occasional humor was also welcome. In summary, I highly recommend Wonder Woman."
"TGblight","6","25","52","4 June 2017"," The fact that it ain't crap, doesn't mean it's art.
","Finally we get a half-decent movie from the DCEU. Compared to the last installments, it's probably the best. But that's not saying much.<br/><br/>To this movies credit, I gotta say that it has an honest heart. it's the first time that they actually feel honest about a movie. This one is not trying to elevate Wonder Woman to something unrealistic (considering the character that she is), it's very grounded, and overall a very enjoyable dumb summer movie.<br/><br/>Having said that. It's not perfect. Like I said. It's dumb, but with a heart. The acting is OK for the most part (even though Robin Wright's helmet thing looked embarrassing and was hard to take her performance seriously just for that). Gal Gadot was OK, Chris Pine was OK. The rest of the cast was kind of there. The plot was a lazy combination of Thor and the first Captain America movie. Pretty dull in my opinion. The way the plot moves is very dumb and most of the conflict is avoidable if some characters would just listen, otherwise they look very stupid, even if the outcome was the same, giving them some common sense would have given them some substance. It just didn't happen, but I give that to the lazy writing. The villain was uninspiring, not a big surprise for this kind of movie, so you know that it comes with lazy CG and motivation. He just serves to have a super claustrophobic final battle filled with explosions and stuff. One kind of head scratching moment for me was that Wonder Woman was trying to avoid the greatest and most violent conflict ever: WWI. So the stakes seem stupid when you know that WWII was way worse and knocking on the door. We are obviously not going to see her react to that. With a big dope face realizing that the war she thought was the worse was pretty much the beginning. <br/><br/>Oh, and the music. I hate it for the most part. I hate her theme. It's way too manipulating and forced.<br/><br/>The things that I would have liked this movie to be are way to many to be listed here. So I leave it at: it was OK, not great, kind of good, very stupid and face-palming. but nothing as sinful as Suicide Squad. And to it's credit it's the first time a DCEU movie actually makes more or less sense.<br/><br/>And to address those who believe that there is a big presence of quality on the film. No, there is not. It's just the first movie from the DCEU that is not complete S H I T. That doesn't make it good."

","So, I first go to Wikipedia and check out it's article on Wonder Woman and see the facts. First, this movie grossed over $800 world wide, against a budget about a buck and half mil. NOT bad! I go to the 'critical response' section and find that the first statement is that this movie received 'mostly positive' reviews from the critics, most claiming it's the best of the Marvel comics movies so far. Hmmm, not bad! I check out other websites like this one, and they gave it mostly a high % with positive reviews. They don't mention this one by the way...and now I'm figuring out why. I see the audience 'exit poll' results and the movie got mostly A and A+s from people leaving the theatre. Hmmm... Then I look at the awards and find it got the best Action Movie awards from the People's Choice Awards and Gal Gadot got best female lead award from the Actors Guild awards, among others. 
So l come over to this website and start with the reviews, and all I see is bunch of whining about how folks can't believe this movie was rated so high on here and why they think this website is rigged, etc. etc. etc. 
Then I figured it out; This website either exists in an alternate reality, or it has a bunch of angry, bitter, depressed people reviewing on it that can't stand the idea that people actually ENJOY sitting down with a bag of chips and dip with your family after a hard week at work, kicking your shoes off, building a fire in the fireplace, and watching a great action movie to enjoy themselves. Because...uh, that's what NORMAL people do! It's a pretty simple word we're working with here, it's called entertainment! I don't sit down with a pen and paper and start crucifying a movie because it's not Lord of the Rings or Citizen Kane. 
Is this the BEST movie I've ever seen?...no
Do you have to suspend belief?...uh, don't you have to do that with every stinkin movie of this genre?..yes
It's a great action movie with great Special Effects and there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with the acting! Chris Pine and Gal Gadot do just fine. The story is just fine. Everything about this movie is just fine.
I keep thinking that I'm done coming to this website, but I felt I had to stand up for this movie against some of the garbage I've read folks spew about it. I'm beginning to think that this website exists in an alternate reality or something, or maybe it's just got a core of reviewers that review movies that are...well, different or something. I don't know...
But do yourself a favor and ignore the negative reviews on here and enjoy this movie that the rest of the normal world thought was pretty good...including me."

","For most people that go to the movies these days, they tend to keep a open mind to the tune of simple things; What will the movie bring? how will the director incorporate certain elements from comics to ""real life"" situations? etc etc For me, Wonder Woman turned out to be one of those movies. Something that comics (DC in this case) expressed in comic books and now have adapted to the big screen (minus the 60's television series and previous adaptations).<br/><br/>Wonder Woman tends to be more action packed at times while carrying to the original idea on how Wonder Woman came to be. Some crude humor made its way into the movie early on then hits you with a dose of sequences full of action and explosions.<br/><br/>For me it was worth watching but I'll probably wait till DC studios comes out with Justice League sometime soon."

This film was a phenomenal disappointment. <br/><br/>Im a big fan of the superhero genre and was hoping this was going to be a great addition - especially as there is a great need for a strong female lead. Unfortunately this film fails at every level. Even the special/visual effects were a let down.<br/><br/>Coming as a spin-off from The Batman v Superman film and leading us into the Justice League franchise I expected a mature direction. However this seems to be aimed at the socially awkward 'Twilight' generation of angst ridden teenagers! <br/><br/>Both Gadot and Pine were wasted here. The dialogue and screenplay were sub-par and cringy. I have no experience writing either and while i may struggle to compose any kind of screenplay, I'm certain I could vastly improve the dialogue and character interaction. Even the direction seemed lacklustre and awry. I've no idea how they could get so many elements wrong without getting any right - even the law of averages seems to have failed here!<br/><br/>Quite simply: AVOID"

","Look just look at the number of people that actually created new accounts on this site (I am one of them) to correct the ratings.<br/><br/>The directing, the writing (your 12 year-old could do a similar job, trust me), the editing (some of the scenes are cut in a way that does not make sense), the acting (Chris Pine could not save the movie), the stupidity of the protagonist (I shall follow the first man I encounter and believe him for no reason, etc.), the god-awful CGI. I can't even. The movie is bad, bad, bad. Everything is bad. End of story.<br/><br/>If this is the best that we can get from the DCEU, the future looks bleak. And seriously, that is obviously a money-grab. Like of course I wanted to love a movie about Wonder Woman! But no, I was fighting not to sleep (I actually fell asleep; had to finish it later...). I am actually crying because it was so bad and I wanted it to be great...and not a very poor imitation of previous MCU movies.<br/><br/>P.S. I am a woman who is flabbergasted that anyone could rate this more that 4/5 out 10. It was beyond mediocre. Well, I guess for DCEU it was a masterpiece? Boy, well guess at least they made tons of money on it. But mark my words, a few years from now, you will be hard- pressed to see someone who will say it was a great movie. People need to take a step back, admit how awful the movie actually was, and then the quality will be elevated. One can only hope."

","Wonder Woman is the thrilling new addition to the DC cinematic Universe of movies following from the ill received by critics Suicide Squad.<br/><br/>I am not going to lie here I walked into this movie very skeptical I wasn't exactly sure on casting a model to play a lead role of an iconic character, however to my surprise Gal Gadot pulled of a a heartwarming performance.<br/><br/>Plot wise it isn't the most elaborate of movies but it doesn't need to be, the movie is about an amazonian princess who lives on this island populated by women only and when she discovers a man she sets out on an adventure to stop the war.<br/><br/>What makes this movie is the relationship that Diana has with this man she just met Steve Trevor who is played by Chris Pine. Here we have a fish straight out of water situation on both sides where Diana can teach Steve about the amazons and Steve can likewise teach her about ""mans world"" which is what Diana calls the world outside of her island. This scenario alone gives this movie so many well timed jokes that are usually brought in by Chris Pines charming performance.<br/><br/>My only real gripe with this movie would be the amount of cgi used at the final act of the movie. Sadly it was rather dark and bland like some of the other movies DC has put out recently; especially because up to then Patty Jenkins the director used tons of colors in this movie especially with Wonder Woman's costume which brings light and hope to people in this hard time in the world.<br/><br/>Overall I was very pleased with the movie reminding me that there is a bright light shining in the DC universe at that is Wonder Woman."
"MichaelNontonMulu","8","19","38","1 June 2017"," The Latest Adaptation of the Powerful Female DC Superhero
","Well, I think this was a rather different type of DC superheroes movies. This one was felt as a combination of fun and a little bit dark altogether. This movie was telling the origin of Wonder Woman and I think it was told in a very nice way. The earlier part showing Diana since her childhood was quite nice to see. What I loved the most was actually the moment when Diana went to London for the very first time. It was truly fun to see the naivety of her in the ""man's world"" and I think Gal Gadot's portrayal in these scenes were very spot on.<br/><br/>What I loved about this movie was also the way Diana evolved from the innocent Amazon woman to what she became at the end. I believe the duration of the movie was just nice even though it was a little bit over than 2 hours. Some might feel it was too long at the beginning but it should not be considered as a flaw. My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. I know she was touched during those emotional moments and I know she loved Gal Gadot portraying Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Chris Pine was charming as Steve Rogers and his chemistry with Gal Gadot seemed very nice. The awkward moments during their trip back to London were very fun to see as well. Steve's allies particularly Sameer was the stand out one. Apart from the fun part, there were also some dark moments and emotional moments as well, reminding us that DC superhero adaptation movies would always have dark tone, but it was not as dark as the other earlier movies. Those of you who prefer lighter tone would definitely be able to enjoy this.<br/><br/>This movie was directed by Patty Jenkins who had just 1 movie to her credit prior to this one, albeit a very highly critically acclaimed one titled Monster (with its main cast Charlize Theron won the Golden Globe and Academy Awards). It was a surprise to me that she was able to make the action sequence looked very cool. The special effects was wonderful. The fight scenes were nice. The sound effects were great, especially since I saw this in a theater with Dolby Atmos sound system. The dramatic, emotional, fun scenes were nicely done by Jenkins. All around I think she did a wonderful job directing this movie and hopefully it would bring more audiences to flock the theaters.<br/><br/>For those who are expecting to see post-credit scene, be informed that this one did not have any, just like in Batman VS Superman: Dawn of Justice. I guess they did not really want to be seen just like any other Marvel movies? (Although there was some brief mid-credit scene in Suicide Squad). <br/><br/>In conclusion, I believe this one was a wonderful superhero movie from DC comics. Not since Elektra in 2005 that a female superhero became the lead of a movie based on comic books. Not even Marvel had it in the Marvel cinematic universe. Perhaps after this, they would be making an independent movie of Black Widow? <br/><br/>Anyway, for those of you who prefer Marvel comics movies compared to DC comics movies due to their lighter tones, I think this one would surprise you. For those who are die hard fans of DC comics, I am sure you would be coming to see this one anyway. But for those who just enjoy the movies adapted from any comic books, you should be able to enjoy this one. Just watch this and you would understand what I meant.<br/><br/>For my complete review pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"

","I really enjoyed this movie and thought Patty Jenkins did an amazing job. DCEU movies in my opinion haven't been that great, but I think this one is a lot better than the others. It was cool to finally see a good female superhero movie. Even though Gal Gadot's acting isn't stellar in my opinion, I think she's really charming and fit the roll nicely. I watched this in a history through film class for WWI, so we looked at comparisons during the battle scenes with gases, trenches, etc. Although their isn't a magical pill you break open to give you super-human strength in real life, some of the other stuff was pretty accurate. I haven't seen other work directed by Patty Jenkins, but I'm hoping the next Wonder Woman installment will be just as good."

","I am a guy so this may be a little slanted but this was a fantastic heroin movie. Wonder Woman is a powerful but naive woman of superhuman power. Great story line as she realizes the true human nature. The movie is long but for me never slows down and i wished it was twice as long. The actress playing wonder woman does a great job portraying a heroine who battles out of dedication and love for mankind with wide eyed enthusiasm. Yes the story get far-fetched like it is a good thing the machine gunner aimed directly at the shield instead of at her feat. But a great addition to the Marvel family with a great background story. In the end she discovers the power of love brings her the quiet confidence to defeat the god of war. Very romantic and maybe sexist but great heroine."

Gal Gadot is an extraordinary actress but her accent is slightly irritating but made up for by the fact that she is perhaps the most beautiful woman I have ever seen on screen. But back to the movie, it is just slightly boring. Just another run of the mill super hero recipe that gets more boring after each passing. I am angry with myself for not watching it from the download I made of it from the Pirate Bay but I was craving coke and popcorn. I am sorry but I refuse to be a party to these movie studios continuing to just roll stuff out because they have a captive audience.

"mtlabfall","10","12","22","25 March 2019"," Not a perfect 10/10
","First, I wouldn't honestly rate this title 10 stars. But I'd be happy to give it 8 or even 9. Why 10 then?<br/><br/>Captain Marvel has a 7.1 on IMDB. Wonder Woman is only .4 ahead of it. That's a crying shame.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot NAILS this character. Her strength, her courage of conviction.. it gives me goosebumps when I think of certain scenes and how righteous and powerful she is.
Chris Pine is also great, and the chemistry between him and Gadot is charming, well-done, and so well-written. Some of the CGI is spotty, but there are some beautiful sequences as well (such as when her mother is teaching her their history).<br/><br/>The third act, and the fight with Aries borders on 'meh'. I also thought the cast of misfit soldiers was kind of annoying at times, and also why did they attend that party in that castle? That whole part where they passed high-level German security with bad German accents was very ridiculous.<br/><br/>But overall, the movie is actually a fun experience. It makes you feel things. When WW goes ""over the top"" of the trenches with her shield, I literally raised my fist in the air and cried 'yes!' (I'm a guy btw).<br/><br/>I have watched WW three times and will gladly watch it again. I saw Captain Marvel recently and will NEVER watch it again.

"gmwatling","4","12","22","16 October 2017"," Disappointing
","Honestly it kinda sucked. It was not what I was expecting at all, I mean originally I didn't have high hopes for this film. It came as a spin off from Batman V Superman (see my review for this) although it started alright with Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman on the paradise island that is only inhabited by women the story went downhill from there. Although it did have some historical accuracy it wasn't very truthful, and I mean come on, when she's at the gala where Ludendorf is, how does no one notice a massive sword in her backless dress. I know it is a film but at least make it realistic, well more than it already is. Don't get me wrong some off the action scenes were pretty cool but she didn't actually do much in them, compared to what other superhero's do when fighting the 'bad guy' she doesn't really do a lot other than destroy what's around her and then in turn it hurts or kills the 'bad guys' That's all there really is to say, it didn't impress me massively as a film so this review is quite short.

"paulijcalderon","7","21","43","1 June 2017"," A wonderful step forward for DC
","DC has finally set their foot in the right direction. Say what you want about the previous films, but I think we can all agree that they weren't as well received as they could have been. Now with ""Wonder Woman"" we have a good solid superhero story that's actually meaningful. Zack Snyder is not directing this time around, but his influence is still felt in the visual style of the explosive action scenes. Those parts are very entertaining, but they don't take center stage here. This film takes the time to introduce us to characters we can understand and care for. I think Patty Jenkins handled the emotional story nicely. I enjoyed the quite scenes as much as the exciting ones. It's about this one journey which makes it easy to follow. So it's not a very complicated film.<br/><br/>The scenery on the Amazonian island is breathtaking. Perfect use of locations. The ancient Greek mythology elements work surprisingly well. The idea of setting the world outside the Amazonian realm during WWI is good. It makes the fish out of water situation with Diana even more interesting, and above all it really helped her development. So that made sense. I will say this though: If you are well educated in history and you happen to know a lot about WWI, then you are gonna be annoyed by some things here. Because it doesn't stay completely true to how everything was back then. Some liberties were taken here and there. I'm not an expert on war history, but my brother is and I had to listen to many things that were inaccurate on the way home after the screening. So, sure. They should have gotten some more history consultants to revise the production. As a normal movie goer you probably won't even think about those things. But if you are a history buff then take note that this is pure fantasy/escapism. You won't be too bothered about historical inaccuracies if you go in with that mindset. I do think the villains were very stereotypical. Most of the time it works, but I would have preferred them not being so much like cartoon bad guys. The final fight gets really bloated and CGI heavy with many explosions. It's handled much better then how it was in ""Batman v Superman"", and I'll tell you why: It was focused. The entire movie balances the human story with the action spectacle well. And that gets a good positive point from me.<br/><br/>The main characters are likable here. There's not much I can add to what's already been said, but I strongly believe I'm seeing Wonder Woman on screen and not the actress Gal Gadot. She embodies this role with pride. Her chemistry with Chris Pine is great. There's some banter towards the end that gets repetitive, but other than that I liked it. The movie has a nice message as well. It's about working together and that love and compassion should never be forgotten. All of those things are nice. This movie has an upbeat vibe overall. It's kind of like a classic adventure movie and I like that. You will walk out feeling happy or maybe even a little inspired. That's a good sign that this will not be forgotten anytime soon. So, yes. I can now say that this a wonderful step forwards for DC. They have definitely improved a lot and I hope they continue like this."

","Phenomenal! Breathtaking (I'm warning you guys, it's true! Gal Gadot as Diana sets the ultimate standard of the perfect heroine - in beauty, fierceness and heart)! Believable (in its mythical way)!<br/><br/>I've seen numerous other super-hero movies (though I missed Superman vs Batman and think I'm glad for it, to have first discovered Wonder Woman in this primary story) but this one is on a whole other class and level. Never has a hero or heroine been elevated to such a level of purity and perfection  which is all the more staggering that: never has a super-hero been as believable as this one. Phenomenal! Talk about buy-in: from the opening scene I was totally immersed and lost in the story  and what a trip it was!<br/><br/>The film-makers (all of them, all together) have made Wonder Woman come to life - in Diana! Ingenious setting and background; spectacular heroine; beautiful film-making, stunts and visual effects (this really is one to see in the best 3D you have access to). I cannot wait for the next Wonder Woman movie! I will watch everything they can throw at us - provided they can somehow keep the standard and integrity of this monumental movie!<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that changes everything moving forward; iconic; a reference point, of which there have only been a handful in my lifetime. So I would have to rate this as one of the most amazing movies I have experienced. <br/><br/>Go see for yourself - in big screen for the first time you watch it, and in 3D if possible!

","Wonder Woman is the DC film we've been waiting for since The Dark Knight Trilogy concluded in 2012. And Wonder Woman is EVERYTHING I wanted it to be. I'll readily admit I was incredibly disappointed with Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad when i saw them at the movies. But now the DCEU is finally gaining the footing it should have achieved with Dawn of Justice. And I LOVE this movie; Wonder Woman is finally in her own movie, after 76 years of comic-book history in the making! The story is self-contained feel good bliss, Gal Gadot is wonderful as Diana, and director Patty Jenkins has brought us the first GREAT female superhero movie!<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is DC's answer to Marvel's Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor; and it makes an even better movie out of the two mixed together. I was happily surprised by how good this movie was. Truly good stuff to find here; Themyscira is FINALLY brought to us on the big screen and it's glorious, and then being taken to World War One Europe is just as fantastically realised as The First Avenger's World War Two setting. This whole film is like a standout issue of the Wonder Woman comic. The story's the perfect playground for developing comic's GREATEST superheroine! Besides some questionable CG in the third act, I don't have any particularly big gripes with the movie.<br/><br/>Hopefully with Wonder Woman DC will give Justice League the narrative focus t deserves (fingers crossed on that though). This film is the first great instalment in the DCEU film series yet, and I'm truly hoping there are other films just as good as Wonder Woman down the line.<br/><br/>The Lasso of Truth compels me to give the movie: 10/10."

I don't say that lightly, but with full knowledge of the faux controversy surrounding Gal Gadot's (an Israeli) casting as the lead. The truth is, this is an entertaining movie. You will enjoy it if you have enjoyed the Marvel movies or superhero movies in general. It has what the vast and overwhelming majority of moviegoers want. Action, laughs, feels and love. Also a hero that *gasp* isn't dark, ironic or edgy. Everyone in my family loves this movie. It's clean; it has no foul language and most importantly no blasphemy, nudity or sex. Is Gadot an Oscar- worthy actress? - no, but she works here. Does the CG get a bit muddy at the end? - Yup, but it diminishes the movie not a bit. Honestly, the worst thing about this movie is it's set in the same universe as the horrifically terrible DC movies ""Batman VS Superman,"" ""Man of Steel,"" and the upcoming and probably bad ""Justice League."""

","Finally, an empowering superhero movie with a woman in the lead! Frankly, I had quite some expectations of this film as it was hyped up to be one of the best DCEU movies, and even though it didn't 100% lift up to those expectations as it definitely has its flaws, it was still a great film with fine cinematography and acting. Gal Gadot got herself a new fan, she was perfect for the role as Wonder Woman and her performance was simply stunning. Worth mentioning is that Chris Pine did a great job portraying Steve Trevor as well.<br/><br/>The movie starts off in the present, we see that Diana receives an old war photograph and a note from Bruce Wayne wishing to hear the story one day. We then zap back in time, to a 'Paradise Island' called Themyscira. A young determined Diana trains to become one of the greatest warriors of her time, wishing to one day wield a powerful sword named the God Killer, in case Ares - God of war, corrupter of mankind - returns.<br/><br/>As the movie continues, Steve Trevor enters the screen in an airplane, crash landing into the ocean whereupon Diana rescues him from drowning. Never having seen a man before, Diana is stunned of his appearance. German battleships followed Steve and an intense battle on the beach of Themyscira between the Amazons and Germans is the result. After the victory, the Amazons learn from Steve that while they were safely hidden, the rest of the world is at war. Believing this is Ares' work, Diana leaves with Steve to fulfill her duty as an Amazon and end Ares once and for all. During their journey, Diana learns that she is not 'just' an Amazon warrior and discovers her true powers.<br/><br/>This movie is much more than 'just a superhero movie' though. It teaches us to love, to believe and to have a heart. The story has powerful and emotional moments. Humor is a theme but is contradicted with conflict, pain, and loss. The battle scenes, the overall cinematography, choreography and musical background were amazing and well done. All of this combined made Wonder Woman whole and a pleasant IMAX-experience.<br/><br/>Was it perfect? No. There are improvements, but that doesn't mean this movie should be thrown into the trash can. Obviously, everybody is entitled to their own opinions, but this is simply about what I believe. <br/><br/>Rate 8/10."

It's a truly funny movie, but when it needs to... And it is convenient. My biggest criticism of some of these super hero movies, I won't name names, is that there's a joke being thrown out every 30 seconds. Even when the stakes are really high, and the world is falling apart, jokes are being thrown everywhere. That doesn't happen in this movie, when it gets dark, it gets dark. When it touches serious subjects such as consequences of war, you kind of feel it. the chemistry between Gadot and Chris is amazing, they were really good together. This was my favorite role he has been in, sry Captain. This is the best DCEU movie so far and the best since The Dark Knight to me, easily.

It gives the much-awaited reason of turning her back to the world of men. <br/><br/>The action is intense the Amazons are fearless and Wonder Woman is unstoppable. <br/><br/>DCEU has found its best movie yet. Snyders vision of the DCEU and Patty Jenkin's direction leads this movie to be one of the best female lead movies of all time. <br/><br/>For People who Liked BvS this will give you goosebumps and for other movie goers, this is definitely worth a watch."

","This movie was bad. Worse than BvS, YES I SAID IT. Slow pace, boring.This movie was bad. Worse than BvS, YES I SAID IT. Slow pace, boring. Most of the moments are awkward , like they try to capture realism , but they failed with that. They try so hard with the drama, that they only thing that was emotional was Trevor sacrifice. You just don't care for anything this movie has to offer. I think somehow god forbid critics to panned it, just because they will be seen as sexist. Which is bad and shows how this works today. The Action, while fill with obvious CGI(which sometimes was crap) was OK. The No Mans Land scene was great. The final battle however was so bad, that I can easily say Ares is as bad as villains from MCU like Whiplash if not worse. Hell, there was practically no villains at all. Diana motives while at the beginning make sense, because she wants to save humanity from war, at the end she somehow believes in humanity because of love, because she had one night with Trevor... WHAT? And oh god, the slow mo... so unnecessary. It felt like i was watching Resident Evil. Plus, it was filled with cliché stuff all of the 2h 30 min run time. Plus there was not even one single good joke in the movie, that felt on point. This is the most overrated movie of all time. Not one god damn thing got excited about the movie. Wonder Woman did not save the DCEU, the critics who was afraid to be seen as sexist does.<br/><br/>Pros: -Gadot - yes she looks like WW to me, but her acting can be improved -Pine - thank god he was there. His charismatic save some of the movie -Sameer was good fresh comic relief at all the times he was there. -Visuals - Themyscira was crafted great. It felt colorful. -Action was good if you look at No-Man's land battle<br/><br/>Cons: -Story - not interesting and full of chicle, like power of love. I mean, for a romantic story this could work, but this movie fails to be romantic story.<br/><br/>-The praised chemistry between Gadot and Pine, was so little(2 or 3 scenes) that there is almost none<br/><br/>-CGI - it was bad and obvious.<br/><br/>-Slow-mo - overused and sometimes felt stupid(specially at the ending)<br/><br/>-Diana motives - at first it was great, she was so naive and that makes her great at the half way through movie, but in the end, all of a sudden it's love. Somehow she gain her strength back and was all-powerful, because she believe in love.<br/><br/>-Villains - All the German General do was shot one of his man at the beginning of the movie, and later fight with Wonder Woman, using some magical serum/slash gas from Captain America. Ares was even worse. He was there talking and talking, and talking. I think final fight was even shorter than Doomsday one in BvS<br/><br/>-Stakes - The only stake here, is the plane full of bombs, which was there for Trevor to sacrifice himself(which was emotional, I give them credit to that), but nothing else. Hell, even Ares said only a God can kill another God, so how there are any stakes for Wonder Woman? Plus while part of DCEU, this felt so disconnected. Its early to say, but I think this movie, won't have stakes which will be presented for future movies(Like Hydra for MCU) -Soundtrack - nothing to be remembered. It was bland. Only WW theme can be recognized. <br/><br/>-Forced jokes - they were bad and didn't even felt on point. How in the world can people say Dick jokes are bad for GoTG Vol 2, but not for Wonder Woman?<br/><br/>Overall, this was made for the sake of Wonder Woman to have her own solo movie and cash grabbing because of her being iconic."

","I grew up watching the old Wonder Woman TV show and as a little kid I loved it but even then knew they couldn't show her doing all she's capable of and looked forward to the day when they would put her on the big screen. It only took 40 years of waiting for me but I'm glad the day is here finally. I loved every minute of it, I get sick of origin stories when we've seen them over and over but since this was the first Wonder Woman to hit the big screen it was perfect. I don't know why some people say it was too long and boring, it was a perfect telling of the story and had the right amount of action in it. If I had any complaint it would only be that Chris Pine's acting in this was just like how he is as Captain Kirk. So basically some of the scenes I could only see him as Kirk the way he was delivering his lines but that's a small worry.<br/><br/>I will definitely be watching this one over and over once I get it on DVD. I'm really loving the DC universe, it's like the complete opposite of Marvel which I think is good they're not carbon copies of each other. Really looking forward to Justice League. If you haven't seen Wonder Woman yet definitely do so."

","-->COURAGE. POWER. WISDOM. WONDER<--
Haters gonna hate! Oh well, let them hate...
It took a while; ages if not; before even considering a movie based solely on a STRONG FEMALE character, a superhero.
This woman is wonder(ful)!<br/><br/>After a too short appearance in the boring Batman v. Superman it was more than necessary to make a film based upon her character which will tell the genesis of Diana Prince(ss of...) a.k.a. Wonder Woman.
The opening sequence is one of the best introducing scene for a well known and beloved comics persona.
The scenery is beautiful, colorful at times and dark-ish for critical action scenes but always with the idea of remaining hopeful!
The direction is inventive and the choreographic for Wonder Woman's action scenes is on point.
Her naivete, her courage and her wisdom -*{even if most of the time she's not even considered as 'human being' from the Men she's surrounded by - except Steve Trevor, Sameer, Charlie and Chief}*- are trademarks for this first adventure, but the power she delivers is surely what makes her now very important for the DC Universe.<br/><br/>The subtext throughout the movie is currently accurate.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot has finally the occasion to show what she can do and she's literally going above and beyond her contracted hours.<br/><br/>SPOILERS ALERT---*---just a tiny bit concerned about the main musical theme for WW's character during the film as I'm not quite sure it was the best choice; although it does work at the end of the trailer---*---SPOILERS ALERT<br/><br/>_____________________________

"darrylgonzalezdg","8","2","2","3 February 2019"," Gail Gadot's acting is stunning, but...
","Ok. First of all, what is good about this film?<br/><br/>1. Gail Gadot was a FABULOUS choice as Wonder Woman. Not only is she STUNNINGLY gorgeous, she brings a tough, gritty depth to the role. VERY well done casting choice and acting job.
2. Chris Pine also did well with his role as Steve Trevor. He played him with authenticity and a bit of roguishness.
3. Cinematography was excellent. It was authentic for the period chosen.<br/><br/>Now for the negatives.
1. The film was set in the wrong period! Wonder Woman was originally a World War 2 character. This might seem like a minor point, but if you're going to make a superhero movie, you need to get the backstory right.
2. The special effects were TOO good. They overpowered the story and nearly became the story.
3. Also Wonder Woman originally teamed with the Americans, not the British. I suspect that since DC had Wonder Woman carrying a shield , they may have made this change and the period alteration in order to avoid copyright infringement with Marvel's Captain America.<br/><br/>Overall, not a bad effort. 7/10 stars."

","Prior to this, I watched all X-Men/Marvel/DC (besides Justice League&Aquaman) movies and thought this was a pretty good watch.<br/><br/>
Yes, it had some flaws but overall I liked it, it gave a good introduction to Wonder Woman, her background and motivations, how the character thinks and what her identity is.<br/><br/>
After reading negative reviews, it makes you really want to hate this movie, all this negative energy.<br/><br/>
But no, I enjoyed it for major parts, I feel too much sympathy for it to give it less than 7*.<br/><br/>
It's not as complex as Batman v Superman, not as bad as Suicide Squad, it has a good mix of amusement, emotions, awesome settings/props/production, action. It has solid parts and I'd say it's close to be great.<br/><br/>
I think some of the villains had to be a bit more convincing and Gal Gadot, while she is extremely beautiful, had to have a stronger physique, especially stronger legs (but hey, that's maybe being too nit-picky, also she was pregnant) to give the movie the final push to be awesome. Also, the CGI was good for the most parts, but similar to 'Black Panther' it sometimes doesn't look 100% correct."

","I am watching this movie for a history though film class. We are watching this movie because it deals with wars in the past. This movie is telling us why there was a war. It is also telling us how Wonder Woman came about. Wonder Woman is a super hero from a long time ago. This movie everyone rode horses and not in cars. They didn't have the technology that we have today. They used swords as their weapons in war they didn't have guns and bombs. One thing I do question about this movie was how nice their places were. In this movie they ride horses just in like all the other movies we have watched. They also don't have phones to play on in these movies. I liked how this movie was interesting all the way though the movie. I also liked how everything looked so real in the movie. I didn't like how rude her mother was. I really liked this movie overall I think this is a movie I wouldn't mind watching over and over again. This movie was very interesting it didn't repeat a lot it kept you on the edge of your seat. I would love to see more movies by this director and these actors."

","When it comes to superhero movies, I will say that Marvel is a tiny bit better at making great superhero films compared to DC. BUT, considering that, Wonder Woman is one of the best superhero movies I've seen to date. Heres why.
Superhero films that contradict with actual world history don't typically please me, but this one was good. Gal Gadot did a fantastic job in this role. She pulls it off perfectly. All the other characters play their roles extremely well. Everything from the environment to the sets to the special effects to the costumes. It all contributes to the nice, appealing look of this superhero film. There are funny parts, and super intense parts.
My 2 nit picks with this film are that it seems General Ludendorff was the only German general with an actual German accent. Um, and the other one was that the filtering in this film seemed a bit over done in some areas. But overall great film!"

","I am reviewing this film for my U.S. History Through Film class. I thought this movie was overall pretty good. I mainly liked the fighting and the main plot. Speaking of fighting, Wonder Woman had this to say about it ""I will fight for those who cannot fight for themselves"". I didn't much like the dialogue between characters though. The main plot of the movie is that this plane lands in Wonder Woman's world and this guy ion the plane tells them about the war (World War 1). The people suspect Eres is behind it so Wonder Woman goes to stop the war. Overall, I was fine with the movie and it would be okay to see others like it."
"one9eighty","8","2","2","16 August 2018"," Wonder-fully making DCU seem relevant after all
","This film is a modern origin movie in the DC Comics universe which brings to screen Gal Gadot as the titular character of Wonder Woman. Living and trained by the Amazonians, a tribe of woman hidden away from civilization on the island of Themyscira, Diana - princess to the Amazonians, is finding her place in the world. In her mind she has lots of questions about her origins and her path in life. One day a male pilot, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), crashes on the island shores. He tells stories of a massive conflict raging across the world, which the Amazonians are oblivious of. Diana decides that she want to help, taking what she needs she leaves with the Steve, much to the disappointment of the Amazonians. On her journey she encounters civilization for the first time and sees the travesties of man, a world war in all its gory glory. She feels that the war has been orchestrated by higher powers, so while fighting for humanity and discovering herself and her powers, she's also trying to uncover the source of evil driving humanity to the mass conflict of war. <br/><br/>Directed by Patty Jenkins and written by Zack Synder this film is one of the gems in DC's sorry attempt to rival Marvel as a big player in the comic book to film franchises - sorry, but only a few DC film's found a level of creditability on screen. Set at the end of World War 1, thematically things were great, costumes seemed right, technology seemed right - it even felt like bleak and smoggy which makes the film feel as though it fits its time and place. The score was passionate and driving and fit the film well - to truly have a great superhero they need to have a theme, and Wonder Woman has one that stands up for itself well. The choreography was decent, a lot of the fighting felt like a ballet at times and it was visually please. The pace of the film was a bit cut and paste, long journeys seemed to happen within seconds with no transitioning - but a younger audience wouldn't be put off. The plot isn't really that complex and there are times when it feels like events of the first Henry Carvill Superman are mirrored in this film, down to the boss fight at the end. I think the acting was good, Gal Gadot - she was believable, naive, fierce - and everything you'd need throughout the film (albeit she occasionally adopted a superhero pose too often - maybe to remind people that she was a super). Chris Pine's Steve Trevor was the best character on-screen, he delivered depth and charm. My main issue was to do with the bad guys - the German's seemed very comical at times, rather than the scourge of the world. Dr Maru (Elena Anaya) could have been soo much more but ended up being a one dimensional baddy which seemed to be placed just to give the film a focal point. On to Ares (David Thewlis), where do we start - this is possibly a criticism of all the DCU films so far, like them Ares was a mess of CGI. Looking at him on screen hurt my senses - it was a let-down to have him as the linchpin to the evil in the film, he could have been soo much more. Honestly it looks like the Ares character was taken straight from a Playstation game, rather than something that had been added to the film on his own merit.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed the film. It was refreshing to have a strong female superhero as the lead. I think that from all the recent DCU films (I'm not counting early Superman, Green Lantern, or Batman films - or even Christopher Nolan Batman films), this has to be one of the best put out. It's a decent platform for them to get stronger and stronger. This is a good action film, good fantasy film, and film that can stand on its own should the viewer not be a fan of comics or other DC films. 8 out of 10"

","""I know it's a misleading title but hold your horses if you're a DC fanboy and want to rain down upon me a slew of abuses. Hear me out first.""<br/><br/>Oh DCEU, you keep churning out mediocre movies and boast of box office returns as a reason to shove down more mediocrity down our throats. Although I loved Man Of Steel (coz I am sucker for Supes) we need to digest the fact that mediocrity in movies and encouraging and supporting them has only made DCEU to not push any envelope. Its no news that Marvel, despite their kiddy-friendly, formulaic movies, is at the top of their game and catching up to them is a feat for DC. If they really want to do that they would have to invest time in fleshing out characters in solo movies than dump a ton in one movie trying to get ahead of the race.<br/><br/>I stopped rooting for DCEU after the third strike that was: Suicide Squad, it was a serviceable movie but has only disappointed me further after the ambitious yet disastrous Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. And this made me genuinely skeptic going in for Wonder Woman. Going against all odds, Wonder Woman had a gargantuan task on its shoulders to come out as at least 'amply entertaining'. Suffice to say, despite its weak screenplay and a flashy 3rd act, Wonder Woman is a winner and much more than being just 'entertaining'.<br/><br/>Directed by Patty Jenkins, Wonder Woman soars above all the other DCEU movies. It was a low bar to clear when it comes to DC movies but its a superbly cast, well directed comicbook movie staying almost true to its roots. Jenkins had to fight to make the movie the way she wanted it to be made. Being an origin movie and one which was never on celluloid format before, Wonder Woman does it just right. Tonally, it feels very different from the other DC movies we've seen so far when it came to composition, color balance, and the inclusion of Diana-centric battle scenes like the iconic No Man's Land scene. It's indeed a feat since the studio had been breathing down the creator's necks, strangling their creative liberty. Did I mention that Wonder Woman also has humour? Yes, you heard it right, a DCEU movie with chuckle-worthy, non-corny moments which isn't forced as well. I am going to give a blind eye to whomever compares it to Captain America The First Avenger. Apart from the genre and the war setting, there isn't much similarities between the two. Apples & Oranges, people! I'd be treading on spoiler territory so I won't tell what they've done, but DC had the balls to do what Marvel never did (you'll know it when you're done with the movie).<br/><br/>Despite my initial skepticism, Gal Gadot embodies Wonder Woman almost flawlessly or at least appearance-wise. Its hard to take your eyes off her when she's onscreen. She shined in her fish-outta-water sequences in London and she nailed it in the well choreographed action sequences on the frontline. Like Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark or Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, its tough to imagine anybody else but Gal in Wonder Woman's shoes for a while. I am sold on Gal playing Wonder Woman. Chris Pine still proves that he's still the best Chris in the industry. I had my doubts on his Steve Trevor character before watching the movie, but he proves to be the best addition that actually lends a lot of heart to the movie Like they say, ""behind every successful woman there is a...wait, wasn't it the other way around...my bad! And its no surprise that Robin Wright aced it as Diana's Amazonian badass aunt, Antiope. Both Elena Anaya and Danny Houston might have shared a little more than 20 minutes screen time with decent performances from both but it wouldn't have hurt to flesh out their characters more, especially Elena's Dr. Poison.<br/><br/>As for the cons, among loose threads aplenty, it is still a 'save-the-world' narrative that we have seen a million times before. Yes, they've got the Wonder Woman character 'almost' right but that doesn't essentially make a great movie. Gal Gadot is indeed a breath of fresh air, a sight for sore eyes but the same cant be said about her acting chops. Agreed, she's new to all of this but she has a long way to go. Another major flaw is something that had also been haunting Marvel movies since day one: weak antagonists. Its tough to raise major stakes when its a superhero movie and although the antagonists in Wonder Woman tries hard to make a kebab outta the world, the lead villain is not even mildly intimidating whom still doesn't look like a menace Wonder Woman cant handle. Also that 3rd act was very reminiscent of Batman Vs Superman's loud and flashy finale, which was another weak point strikingly in contrast with a very colorful Thermyscra-based first act and a grim yet exciting battle-heavy second act.<br/><br/>Movie scores are something I have grown listening to and humming to all my life. Sadly, Rupert Gregson William's Wonder Woman score doesn't live up to the movie's visuals. I'd say its ridden with the same flaw as Marvel's score, its sounded generic. The only bits that was exciting was when the movie used Hans Zimmer's original Wonder Woman theme from Batman Vs Superman and that definitely gave me goosebumps.<br/><br/>I'll be frank, I havent read much Wonder Woman comics and like many, I was seasoned to macho-superheroes. I loved her in the Justice League tv show, 2009's animated movie (which is brilliant) and Batman Vs Superman yet I was someone who preferred wearing Superman/Batman tees to Wonder Woman tees. Today, I am glad that Wonder Woman is not just an epic win for DC it is also the first female-directed, female lead superhero movie that every comicbook fan had been waiting for aeons. It's success marks the confidence of female-lead movies in a skeptic, masculine-lead Hollywood. It also ups the ante for superhero 'solo' movies. Whether it was planned or not, just like the post's banner says ""Justice Begins With Her"", Wonder Woman proves to be the one who should lead the upcoming Justice League movie. Warner Bros might want to put their merchandize-selling, flying rodent-suited mascot on the back burner for their next outing.<br/><br/>All said and done, I hope DC and WB doesn't become all smug with one blockbuster in the pockets and continue its race with Marvel. So yea, let's trash DC if they follow this good movie up with more loud, mediocre, CGI-heavy movies."

","Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is strong, intelligent, charismatic, funny, compassionate, fierce, courageous, empathetic, and somehow still relatable. She's everything we need today in super hero - hopeful and strong. While the movie itself has some clunky points (especially the CGI at the end), Gadot's performance is everything I could have hoped for in Wonder Woman. As a life-long WW fan, I had my concerns about how this would come off, but she's perfection! I hope she's able to continue in the Role. I have a 7-year-old daughter, and I'm thankful to have a role Godot's wonder woman for her to look up to, the way I looked up to Superman as a boy."

","Not me of course, though I do admit I was wondering if this was going to be any good. DC did not have the best record concerning building up their universe, so skepticism was not really out of the ordinary. But the movie proved me wrong and made a lot of things right. And it's really nice that it's the Wonder Woman movie to kick off that trend. I know some will either cherish that and others will hate it - just try to leave the feminism discussion out of it.<br/><br/>And enjoy a movie that really captures the making of a superhero. Wonder Woman rising in the best sense. There still are some hurdles that are tough to overcome. The main villain for example has his issues, but for every thing that may not work 100% you have twice or three times as many other things that are really good. Take Chris Pine for example: I wasn't sure if this was necessary casting ... but it very much was. You needed someone who could hold his own. And Gal Gadot really is amazing in this. Looks and beauty aside, she really pulled her weight acting wise."

","Wonder Woman is pure summer escapist entertainment. These blockbusters were designed to get people into the theaters and to appeal to 15-year-old boys in Taiwan - normally not my thing, but they definitely have their place.<br/><br/>Here Diana is Gal Gadot who has it all and boy does she kick some you-know-what. The actress apparently did her own stunts, including while she was five months pregnant. So she's a superwoman in real life and in reel life, also having served with the Israeli Army.<br/><br/>The cast includes Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, and Danny Huston. How fabulous to see the ""House of Cards"" leading lady, Wright, as an Amazon warrior.<br/><br/>In this version, Diana fights in World War I, not II, which director Patty Jenkins found more interesting.<br/><br/>Filmed partially in Italy, the settings are glorious. <br/><br/>Superheroes, all-powerful men and women who fight evil in the world, started to become popular during World War II, I wonder why, feeding into the fantasy of someone swooping down and solving our problems. If only! But there's nothing wrong with being entertained, looking at a couple of beautiful people in Pine and Gadot, and hearing that only love can save the world. It's a good reminder and bears repeating."

In this story, the only challenges that Wonder Woman faces are the challenges we all face...and that is, the challenge to remain positive and selfless in a world tarnished by so much lust, greed, selfishness, hatred, and war. <br/><br/>The movie opens up in present day with a narrative by Diana, and she explains a little bit of her backstory to Bruce Wayne in an email. I loved this inclusion into the film, as it brings the DC characters closer as we get ready for Justice League. And so as she writes Bruce, the film moves on to the beautiful Amazon Island, where Diana grew up. The film never really felt like an origin movie though, and these early scenes served as a means to explain why the Amazonian Goddesses no longer meddle in earthly affairs. <br/><br/>We are quickly introduced to Trevor, the British air force pilot, played brilliantly by Chris Pine, who informs Diana and the Amazonian Princesses of the World War taking place on Earth. His story compels Diana to leave the island try to help mankind pull through the turmoil, in which her misanthropic mother, disagrees. Chris Pine stole the show along with Gadot, both displaying excellent chemistry. <br/><br/>The feminism in this film was very light compared to some of the comic stories in the past. The social commentary was strong though, having to do with various social constraints placed on woman at the time, in Victorian England, as well as the structure of modern military, and the lack of honor in modern warfare. <br/><br/>I thought the action in this film was beautiful, albeit, at times, over done, but only for a split second or two. For the most part, Wonder Woman awed me with her hand to hand combat, swordplay, and rope-play! Zack Snyder's visual style was all over this film, and it makes sense, given that he produced the film. <br/><br/>In the end, Diana comes face to face with not only a threatening villain, or a threatening weapon, but more menacingly, she faces her own doubts and insecurities about mankind, which are depicted in the form of Ares, the God of War, who in my opinion, served as not just a physical threat, but metaphorically, a sort of mental one, a sort of voice in her mind, convincing her that mankind does not deserve her help... or the help of any God. In the end, Diana must decide;--does she abandon mankind? Or does she continue to have faith in it;--and if the latter, why? <br/><br/>It doesn't take her long to figure out why after realizing why she had fallen in love with Trevor and even though mankind is flawed, Diana learns that Love is our savior, and it is up to us to allow ourselves to fight our doubts and fears so that they do not interfere with our ability to love;--because only love could save us all. <br/><br/>9 out of 10."

","Wonder Woman starts as a movie about innocence in a tribe of warriors, hidden from the world, forever unchanging.<br/><br/>But that innocence grew restless, with blooming ideals inside, and restless to fight.<br/><br/>This theme permeates the whole movie until its satisfying, superheroical conclusion.<br/><br/>Diana, Daughter of Hippolyta, Queen of The Amazons, is a young woman destined to be something cruel, but growing up innocent. Her innocence will be slowly peeled off her after a man, of male type, crash landed on the sea near her paradise island of Themiscyra. His intrusion into the hidden island brings more carnage of the outside world, until blood was shed on paradise and this innocent young woman started to feel the call to go out there into the world.<br/><br/>The call her mother understood perfectly, thus her permission for the young woman to go with the man into the world.<br/><br/>Her innocence, she carries everywhere, even in front of military generals whose sole purpose is to kill.<br/><br/>Her innocence started to be tested in the world of men, and she started to waver.<br/><br/>Thankfully, she has a guide, an anchor to her conscience, in the form of the first man ever step into the Paradise Island. Steve Trevor.<br/><br/>Steve has other ideals, a more mature form of willingness to do good, a grayed out form.<br/><br/>He carried her through civilizations that subjugate women, that battles without honor, that murder women and children. <br/><br/>He carries this powerful innocence through all that, and see her powers bloom.<br/><br/>And when even her powers are not enough to anchor her innocence, shattered as her ideals are shattered, he provided words that provide good tether to this new reality of hers. A solid foundation upon which she will go on from this precipice of her fates.<br/><br/>This movie is not about Diana, not at all. This movie is about Diana, Steve, and the haunts of wars, and what to do to keep one's innocence.<br/><br/>In the end, it's what you believe in. And Diana of Themiscyra chose Love."

","Like a lot of people, I was anticipating the release of the movie. I waited patiently for the June 1 release date. And the wait was worth it.<br/><br/>The title character, Diana, made me laugh when she looks at the world in 1918. Gal Gadot brings in a charming performance that made me wish she'd win awards. She really brought the character to life and she doesn't seem scared about the backlash she received. <br/><br/>Gadot isn't the only amazing performance in the film. Chris Pine somewhat plays a less mischievous portrayal when compared to his other roles like Star Trek. He's rogue, cynical, charming, and it made me sad that his character perishes in the third act of the film.<br/><br/>The action scenes are well choreographed. The amazonian battle scenes really emphasize the power of the warriors and they don't hold anything back. The No Man's Land scene is probably my favourite scene out of all. Seeing Diana/Wonder Woman climb up a ladder and block a rifle bullet from far away made my mind scream. <br/><br/>The soundtrack perfectly accompanies the films tone, message, and action. Diana blocking an onslaught of machine gun bullets with her shield while epic music played in the background sent chills up my spine. I had goosebumps for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was definitely worth the wait and I can't wait to see more of where director Patty Jenkins will take Wonder Woman to."

","Superhero movies are my guilty pleasures. As long as they are not DC! This movie is a sleeping pill (it really feels like it is going on forever) with extremely bad CGI and over-use of either slow motion or speed up effects to try to make up for the tatty computer work. The start of the movie, with young Diana watching the Amazons training, gives a clue to how bad the CGI is. And the poor quality runs throughout the film. Films in the 90s made it better! <br/><br/>The acting is unconvincing from most of the actors unfortunately, and huge plot holes leave you shaking your head over this 2hr20min nonsense. <br/><br/>So, my verdict? Just don't bother! If you like this sort of stuff, do yourself a favour and re-watch something from Marvel. It is beyond me how DC is failing massively yet again to deliver a watchable movie. I have seen most from Marvel quite a few times, they are entertaining and the CGI is stunning! When it comes to WW, I could hardly get through it the 1st time around. The thought of walking out on the movie halfway through, exited me more than the movie itself."
"Platypuschow","6","14","27","29 March 2018"," Wonder Woman: Just not feeling it
","I'm glad that a female fronted superhero movie actually did well at the box office, I'm appalled it took this long and was thrilled at seeing the figures.<br/><br/>Now when I first learned Gal Gadot was due to play Wonder Woman I wasn't sold, I just saw this tall skinny girl but was proven wrong in Batman vs Superman (2016) where I thought she did great. But a standalone movie? This was the ultimate test and though I think she did well I believe her proper debut failed on a lot of fronts.<br/><br/>A tweeked version of her origin story Wonder Woman is full of famous faces and fantastic choices for the most part, it had a tsunami of funding and a competent lead. So what went wrong?<br/><br/>The same as Batman vs Superman in my opinion, the DC Universe is simply not getting off to a good start. Flashy, cheesy and with some awful awful dialogue Wonder Woman failed to impress.<br/><br/>I'm not saying its a bad film, I'm just saying for every good scene there are 5 average ones and a couple of stinkers.<br/><br/>What took me back was the CGI, this is a AAA movie so why are there so many crappy looking shots? Truly unforgivable considering the budget, the script is weak, the story is predictable and the whole thing is somehow cheesier than the original television series (And that's saying something).<br/><br/>I went in expecting gold but came out with mildly tarnished bronze at best, I wanted to like this I really did but am so unimpressed I'm just going to assume Justice League will be seven shades of abyssmal.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Great score<br/><br/>Well cast<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Some choreography is off<br/><br/>Some bizzarely bad cgi<br/><br/>Very different from the original story<br/><br/>Barely connects to the universe they are trying to create<br/><br/>Things I Learnt From This Movie:<br/><br/>Each year judging by ratings people are easier and easier to please<br/><br/>I always consider Tom Cruise unconvincing in action scenes, he looks outstanding compared to David Thewlis<br/><br/>DC is not going to be catching up to Marvel, ever. This confirms it."
"poghuhuedui","4","14","27","31 July 2017"," Disappointing
","Wonder Woman received lots of praise when it first came out either because it was the only DCEU film that wasn't completely abysmal or because it had a female lead. I don't care about male or female leads, I just want to watch a good film. So does Wonder Woman fill that duty? No. Is it horrible? Also no. It has serviceable action and a decent score. But beyond that? Nothing holds up, the story is basic and predictable. The two leads, Steve Trevor and Diana are the only passable characters, every other character was forgotten as soon as the credits rolled. Every film needs a character arc. The character has to change or learn something. In Wonder Woman they lay it out perfectly, Diana will learn that things aren't as black and white as she thinks, she'll learn that evil is within everyone. Just as they are on the cusp of achieving a successful character arc they blow it all away so that they could cram in a ten-minute cesspool of CGI and stupid action. Nearly $150,000,000 was spent making this film, but they miss the fundamentals of story telling? Warner Bros. should've quit while they were ahead after The Dark Knight Rises."

","""Wonder Woman"" is certainly one of the best (if not THE BEST) superhero adventure recently released by the cinema industry. The film is a comic book on the big screen, with a very well written screenplay and a very attractive and full of action story. The cast is fantastic and Gal Gadot and Chris Pine show a wonderful chemistry with their never boring romance. The beauty of the charming Gal Gadot is exotic and sexy she really ""steals the show"" with her perfect performance. The top-notch special effects is state-of-art and impressive. The direction of Patty Jenkins surprises since this is her first blockbuster work. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Mulher Maravilha"" (""Wonder Woman"")"
"cmfernandez316","9","19","39","1 June 2017"," A huge step up
","Patty Jenkins has done it. After we had witnessed the critical duds like Suicide Squad and BVS, we now have a film that will be truly known as the first great DCEU movie. Let me get you into the details without spoilers.<br/><br/>Entertainment factor. The movie's greatest strength for me is in its humor and it didn't bore us like the last DCEU films. Action scenes were great with no hiccups. Editing was an improvement also from the previous DC films. Thank God. <br/><br/>Production value. You could tell they really took the time even if the budget is much lower than a typical Marvel movie. Costumes and the film locations were chosen wisely. From the sandy beaches of Diana's homeland, Victorian London, to the grittiness of a WW1 battlefield.<br/><br/>CGI. Much of the movie were made with practical effects but some scenes are with a green screen background. Some of the CGi were unconvincing but tolerable throughout the movie. No complaints though.<br/><br/>Acting. Is good, everyone played their part like they were meant to be but no Oscar-worthy roles. Gadot's performance and role as the Amazonian princess definitely perfect albeit her acting needs more polishing. Chris Pine felt natural in his role as usual. Supporting characters were also noteworthy in their roles.<br/><br/>Overall an entertaining ride from start to finish. Definitely recommend. 8.5/10"
"optimus_alderson","10","10","18","7 March 2019"," Wonderful!
","Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is everything we want from a super hero - strong, courageous, empathetic, kind, just, fierce, loyal, and yet somehow still relatable. As a life-long WW fan, I had high hopes going in, and while there is some clunkiness for sure in the movie (the CGI at the end, for instance), Gadot's charisma makes up for it in spades.<br/><br/>Two other stand-out performances are from Connie Nielsen as Hippolyta and Robin Wright as Antiope. Wright especially takes what she's given in the role and makes the most of it, I found myself wanting to spend way more time with her Antiope.<br/><br/>I'm thankful that Patty Jenkins gifted us with a Wonder Woman that my daughter can look up to, the way I looked up to Superman when I was a kid. Thank you for this!"

","Gal Gadot did an amazing job as Wonder Woman. The film was a little slow paced at times and left confusing messages over the power of the Amazonian's - when you see the ending and how Wonder Woman's true powers are sparked. The leading man in the film was a bit of a 'meh' performance, someone else could have played the part with a little less spunk and a little more complimenting presence. Good, solid but not amazing."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","10","18","16 July 2017"," Not a wonder, not a blunder
","As someone who does enjoy superhero films when done right, there are some good ones out there as well as some disappointing ones. Enjoyed the character of Wonder Woman as a kid, and always felt compared to other superhero characters that she deserved her own film.<br/><br/>Which she gets in this 2017 effort directed by Patty Jenkins. Is 'Wonder Woman' as good as the hype and a wonder of a film? Not to me, there are a few things that stop it from being even better. Does it deserve the negativity in a lot of the comments here? While it is easy to see why people would be disappointed, as it could have been better, my answer would be no and that some of the hate is over the top.<br/><br/>There are problems here in 'Wonder Woman'. Part of it is to do with pacing, the film starts a little dull in places and later on as more happens in the story it felt rushed and at times it affects the storytelling which has its muddled moments.<br/><br/>The ending is clichéd and anti-climactic and some of the characters feel underdeveloped, especially the underused and underwritten villain.<br/><br/>However, 'Wonder Woman' is mostly an exceptionally made film, apart from instances of frenetic editing, with a lot of atmosphere in the production design and lighting, audacious photography and special effects that are super slick. The music has a haunting sense of mood and rousing energy, and Jenkins directs with an understanding of the titular character and accommodating the performing of Gal Gadot.<br/><br/>Script has some witty humour, heartfelt sentiment and also takes itself seriously without making the mistake of previous BC Extended Universe (of which 'Wonder Woman' is by far the best, actually being a good film) of being too grim and dark. The action is stirring and often spectacular in spectacle.<br/><br/>'Wonder Woman's' story has its faults but most of it is heartfelt and thrilling. It does the character of Wonder Woman justice with a genuinely interesting back-story that makes her a compellingly real and easy-to-relate-to character who you admire for all her strengths and flaws.<br/><br/>Gadot is superbly cast as Wonder Woman, creating a character that really stands out among the rest of the superhero line in terms of gender and her ideals. Chris Pine is amusing, commanding and likable with great chemistry with Gadot, while Danny Houston clearly enjoys himself as the villain. The rest of the cast do very solidly.<br/><br/>Overall, not a wonder but a long way from a blunder. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","Ugh! This movie is a good example of how not to make superhero origin movies. We'll probably forget it for a good reason after the studios make big money out of it. <br/><br/>I love superhero origin movies. I feel this one might have worked well in an age void of the Batman or Ironman or Spiderman origin stories or even Thor for the heck of it. Well maybe not even then. Those characters did actually look and feel like superheroes you could relate with and they looked real. Imagine Ironman without Robert Downey Jr or Batman without Christian Bale. Nope, DC went down the first time with Man of Steel. And Now This.<br/><br/>You have a Wonder Woman played by Gal Gadot who doesn't even look like she remotely has anything to do with Amazon except maybe the Wood on her face along with the rest of her clan. I get all the glitz and glamour with her costumes and makeup. But if they wanted to do that they should have done a modeling gig or a cosplay shootout and not a movie. And the chemistry between her and Chris Pine is like mixing milk with vinegar, completely forced and unnecessary making the movie curdle up in your face. Even the villain is such a major let down. What's left is a predictable plot with monotonous characters acted by human cutouts headed by a director who slept well through her job.<br/><br/>Costumes and sets are great and cinematography looked fine too but even the fight scenes are boring and atrocious to watch as they lack realism or visual bravado. This all accompanied by the jarring sound track every-time Wonder Woman shows up makes it all the more pretentious towards the audience. Maybe it was the one thing could've saved this movie just like it did in Batman vs Superman. It was unoriginal but somewhat managed to redeem the previous movie only to prove they can't do it every-time. <br/><br/>This movie is at best a commercial marketing gimmick and at worst a complete waste of senses I wished I had the luxury of leaving behind in a heap of thrash notwithstanding the constant bombardment of hype by the media regarding how people are raving about it. Sorry I don't get it at all. I'd rather watch reruns of Deadpool then revisit this again ever."

","I cannot tell you how glad that this movie lived up to the hype. I was so severely disappointed with Batman v Superman except the Wonder Woman part. So I was a bit worried but this is a runaway hit. Gal Gadot commands the title character and thank god because I know there were people who were surprised at her casting. The director allowed her to be the heroine and not just as another capable woman being rescued by some guy. She comes off as powerful. The movie is exciting. The pace is great. I was also worried that it would feel dated like the first Captain America being as the setting was during WW1. But it felt fresh while holding onto the WW1 setting. The movie focuses on Gal Gadot and never distracts with side characters like the previous movie this character was in (Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice). In the end, you didn't want it to end and that is about as high a praise you can say about a movie. I wanted more. If I was going to rate it among the DC movie, its a very very close second to The Dark Knight, because the Dark Knight had a great villain. But no one has a better hero of all the DC movies than this one."

Most if not all plot devices are shortcuts and are so badly introduced into the story that it honestly takes you out of the movie if you value story over whiz bang effects.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Speaking of effects, the CGI is shockingly bad, especially the battle scenes. It's very unnatural, like the ""wire-fu"" or ""Charlie's Angels"" days of defying physics and gravity. Blurry background and shaky cam are the worst.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The overall story telling is as stereotypical as it gets. I know it's a period piece but the big bad, the awkward love story and the hyper-feminist overtones all jumble in to one big mess.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The attempted balance of humor and darkness fails. It had to be a result of orders from higher ups that wanted to try and inject some Marvel movie type sensibilities.

Diana gets combat trained despite her mother (and Queen!) not consenting. The arising conflict should have taken more than 2 lines of dialogue to be resolved. This would have also impacted Diana, her mother didn't want her to learn combat and suddenly wants her to be the best. Why? This is a page right out of Zack Snyder's Martha handbook of resolving issues.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Fighting. The creative decision was that Amazonians don't fight, they ballet. Every jump, swing from a rope, shooting an arrow, getting off a horse is a dance move. It just looked ridiculous.</li></ul><br/><br/>Strike a pose: WW literally poses in each and every shot. She has her shoulders pushed back like she is trying to make her shoulder blades meet. It looks unnatural and odd. The poses are the exact same as in BvS. There is...wrists crossed in front of the face, crouching behind the shield, standing in a wide stance and the jumping pose with one knee bent. And they are shot exactly the same as in BvS. They probably just reused clips. They are not poses in the middle of a range of movements. It's pose, pause for 5 secs, next pose, pause for 5, repeat.<br/><br/>Humour: This is not comic relief. They dedicated a continuous 15-20 min segment and it all stems from the cultural differences between the Amazonians and us. The bath scene, sleeping in the boat, the secretary, the clothes trials... all stems from the same issue. It's the same material stretched for 15 mins and frankly gets tiresome.<br/><br/>Villain: In a weak attempt to create twist, the villain is introduced late in the film. There is no time to associate with the character. The villain exists simply as someone to be fought.<br/><br/>Final battle: Visually, this sequence is identical to the doomsday fight in BvS. If someone mashes these 2 scenes up, it will be hard to differentiate one from the other.<br/><br/>The McGuffin: There is no reason given why WW goes into hiding. What is the entire deal with the photograph and the secrecy? There's so much focus on this but it's not resolved.<br/><br/>Gol Gadot: O!M!G! Could there possibly be a better WW? But she's posing and grunting though the entire movie. Very off putting. Her acting skills fluctuate quite a bit too. Perhaps since her character also fluctuates. WW goes from being head strong, doing what SHE wants, to naive and easily persuaded, to emotionally distraught by the horrors of war, to a super hero that's reckless. BTW since she has no clue of the real world, how does she know if she's fighting on the right side? Also considering Amazonians are warriors, for whom battle training is the only form of recreation, why is she horrified by war?<br/><br/>Fight Choreography: Other than the training sequence, the choreography is a close second if not at par with the fights in Captain America 2 but the slow motion ruins it completely. It's not used to accentuate the fight, every punch goes in to slo-mo. If! everything! is! accentuated! nothing! stands! out! This coupled with the grunting just spoils each fight."""

","DC isn't going through a good time: Marvel keeps having huge success with most of both movies and TV shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) while the DCEU keeps giving the fans great disappointments since Man of Steel (including the latter) ... Well, Wonder Woman proves the hype was deserved and it's by far the best DC movie since 2012's The Dark Knight Rises!<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot. Remember these names because it's due to them that we finally have a phenomenal superhero movie with a strong female lead character.Â Gal Gadot is one of the best casting choices ever, she's one of those few people that make me feel like I can't watch any other actress portray the role ofÂ Wonder Woman. She elevated the movie in a way that I never thought an actor/actress could do, so it's easy to say that she's definitely the best achievement of the film.<br/><br/>Chris Pine also gives a great performance and the amazing chemistry between him and Gadot makes me care a lot for the characters that are extremely well-developed in an excellent slow-paced first half of the movie, which is an unusual feature having in mind previous comic-to-movie adaptations. It proved very efficient because all that time spent with the main characters, learning about them and what they believe in, it all makes me really care about them so, when the battle arrives and they're in danger, it all feels way more emotional. THIS is what DC kept failing at: giving us characters under-developed, with no motivations whatsoever, put them in the middle of a fight and expect the fans to appreciate the excessive CGI and explosions.<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins is a great director and this movie proves it: amazing COLORFUL visuals, the stories feel heartfelt and honest, the comedy is surprisingly great and the dialogue scenes, especially betweenÂ Diana andÂ Steve, are compelling and super captivating. The soundtrack is epic during the action scenes which are itself the definition of epicness. The first time that Wonder Woman goes into the battlefield (the one shown on the trailer) gave me chills all over my body, it's just E-P-I-C! Even if CGI is present in almost every single one of the action sequences, it's mostly well-used and it reached the awesomeness levels that I expected.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, but efficient (even if implausible) and it still has a small not-that-obvious twist in the third act that's actually kind of cool.<br/><br/>As for flaws, there's one that is common to every single comic-book movie ever: the villain. Once again, this character is weak (it's actually more than just one character), with no motivations besides ""destruction, yeah, war, yeah, let's kill everyone, yeah"" and all of the clichÃ©s are put together into one big disappointment.<br/><br/>The final battle is CGI-heavy and there were some brief moments where it almost looked like a video game, but due to the fact that I cared so much about the characters, this becomes just a minor issue that I didn't even get bothered with during the action. The slow- motion looked cool, but it got overused by the end of the movie. Finally, I think that the movie is a tiny bit too long, but I guess every superhero movie nowadays needs to have at least a 2-hour runtime or it's not worth it for the studios, apparently.<br/><br/>So, Wonder Woman is, in fact, the savior that the DCEU needed and it not only proved the hype and huge anticipation something worth going through this last few months, but it surpassed everything I expected this movie to be. Thank you Patty Jenkins for the brilliant direction (visuals, character-development, action scenes, soundtrack, just everything), thank you Gal Gadot for your incredibly honest performance and thank you Chris Pine for being a perfect companion for the emotional journey you all took me through, even if with some flaws here and there (please, improve your villains DC and Marvel).<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"
"toensie87","3","18","37","22 July 2017"," Just as bad as BatmanVSuperman & Suicide Squad
","Before I start I want to be clear on something, I gave the movie 3 stars, but it's not that bad, the movie deserves between a 4.5 and a 5.5. The reason why I gave this movie a 3 is because of the UNBELIEVABLE hype it got and the only reason for that is because it's a super-hero movie directed by a woman and it stars a woman. (I don't hate women, and I am not anti-women at all, because nowadays if you say those things you will be labelled women hater for no reason). So to balance it off I am giving it 3 stars, because seeing it's getting 8s/9s that it never deserves.<br/><br/>The first thing I absolutely hated about this movie and it's the SAME thing with BatmanVSuperman & Suicide Squad, literally EVERYTHING you saw in the trailer were the ""best"" and most ""important"" parts in the movie. You don't even have to go to the movie because you can watch those trailers.<br/><br/>The story and the movie itself were so boring, there was nothing happening at all, you don't feel anything for the characters and character development was nowhere to be found , the movie was dark, except for the themyscira part , and don't get me wrong I have nothing against dark/heavy movies (The Dark Knight is one of my favorite movies) , but the cinematography in the movie falls short. I don't want to even start about the forced jokes and the one-liners that were made especially for the cinema audience.<br/><br/>So what was ""good"" about the movie: I thought the pacing and the story structure were actually better than BatmanVSuperman & Suicide Squad. You had a beginning , a middle part and a end part that made sense and were not all over the place. The fighting sequence and the special effects were also good enough, not mind blowing but it was nice. The acting was not bad, The only one I really didn't like was Gal Gadot. She does not have something special except that she is nice looking , but to be honest she was not bad or something I've seen worse.<br/><br/>The story itself was OK, everything made sense and like I said it suited the pacing well.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was slighty better than BvS and Suicide Squad because of the pacing and the movie structure, the bad guy in this movie was as bad as those other movies and it had the same problems as the other 2 movies.<br/><br/>What I really don't understand, this amazes me, fumes me, blowes my mind, is how is it possible that the ones responsible for DCU and are calling the shots are still giving Zack Snyder & Co a chance. BatmanVSuperman was so bad it damaged the image of those 2 beloved characters, Suicide Squad was ridiculous bad and now Wonder Woman falls in the same category. I made up my mind, even if I love DC so much I will not be going to Justice League , even if it get's a 10/10, what it certainly will not seeing Zack snyder is responsible for this it will be a big turd as well."

","So as a person who prefers Marvel over DC, this movie was excellent. Funny, full of Action, Exiting, and Sad. It is by far the best DC movie since The Dark Knight, and much better than the other movies in the DC Cinematic Universe. Great Cast, Great Story, and I'd recommend to anyone"
"bridgetstuart","10","22","47","2 June 2017"," Incredible movie!!!
","This truly is a must see movie - whether or not you like comic book movies. From the first note of music, you are drawn into this world, these characters, the action, and the intrigue. They skillfully pack a lot of story into this movie along with refreshing character development, engaging dialogue, humor, and keen insight. You will leave this movie feeling like you are ready to change your own life, your own world.<br/><br/>The performances are nuanced. The cinematography - stunning. The action - intense. I typically loathe the phrase ""this movie has something for everyone"" as I find that usually applies to movies that I personally find to be stretched too thin, movies that go out of their way to TRY and have something for everyone, movies that have a contrived feel. However, this movie is deep, rich, and passionate, and i believe that everyone would enjoy it. <br/><br/>I plan on seeing it again in the theatre, and I have not done that for several years. (and I am a movie nut.)"

","I always watch movies before reading reviews. Despite its mythology and practical inaccuracies, WW was very pleasant to watch and had the quality direction and artistic-sequences that Snyder used us to expect.<br/><br/>I read afterwards the surprisingly too many hating reviews which could be categorized in 3 categories: those who judge as documentary commentators, those whose views are biased by Marvel and those who doubt the impartiality of IMDb.<br/><br/>To the 1st I have to say that at this moment BBC produces a supposed accurate retelling of Trojan war, including black actors as Achilles and Patroclos. While in a first script of WW, she was supposed to be of extraterrestrial origin and Superman's kin! So you can understand my relief when I found out that it wasn't the case and that mythology damages were contained. <br/><br/>To the 2nd I will retort that except Dr Strange and the 1st Captain America I didn't see any memorable movie or TV series from Marvel whose stories are inconsistent and boring. <br/><br/>To the 3rd I would advise to check Box Office Mojo where WW stands 5th in all-time comic adaptations.<br/><br/>Despite a few scenario holes and a couple of bad CGI, the movie respects the feminist ideas conveyed traditionally by the character and provides a good entertainment"

","Lol, sorry for all the people unable to get on the hype train or just not comic book fans, but i liked this a lot- it finally had what other DCEU movies lacked, namely a heart and brought joy to the hero. Chemistry between the leads was good, and not to forget it was an origin story so setting up a character takes up a large portion of time. Yet, it never falls into the joyless narrative mess of Batman vs Superman, and certainly has more gravitas than most of the cookie cutter Marvel films.<br/><br/>The thing that really sold it was looking next to me and seeing young family members, all girls smiling with joy. If that isn't an overwhelming sign of success for this particular film, i don't know what is."
"prabhatrayal","9","15","30","6 June 2017"," Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman
","I had been waiting for this film for over a year. I had my exam yesterday but I was more worried about making it to the theater on time. I finished the exam within an hour and 15 minutes and rushed to the IMAX. I was not disappointed. I cleared the exam and the movie was good.<br/><br/>Wonder Women is the best DCEU movie till date.<br/><br/>It hooks you right from the beginning. You see the beautiful world of Themyscira and want to join the beautiful ladies in their quest. The CGI sequence telling the story of Zeus and Ares is brilliantly done. I hate Slow-Mo but Wonder Woman used it in a good way. It was a thrilling experience to watch it on an IMAX screen. It made me wonder if I was really watching a DC film. It did not feel like a DC film at all.<br/><br/>Most of the DCEU movies have suffered from the same problem. They take things too seriously. I mean, I love Batman and I love the dark atmosphere they create in those films but what's the problem with one or two good jokes? Most of their films maintain the same dark tone throughout the run-time. When they decided to go the Marvel in Suicide Squad, it turned out to be a big turd. Fortunately, Wonder Woman does not suffer from the same problem. It works on multiple levels. It has got style with substance. It has got action and emotions. It has a got a good foundation, over which multiple layers are placed beautifully. There is character development and you get to see how Wonder Woman becomes Wonder Woman. Now, this may sound like I am exaggerating but DC has disappointed me so much in the past that WoW feels like a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Acting wise, Chris Pine was brilliant but it is Gal Gadot who stole the show. She was made for this role. Her transformation throughout the film is brilliant. To be honest, watching her kicking some butt on the big screen was worth the money and wait.<br/><br/>It isn't without faults though. The biggest problem with the film is the climax; I saw it coming from a mile away. Also, the ending is a bit too much CGI and made me feel like I was watching a Michael Bay or Snyder film, which kind of ruins an otherwise amazing experience.<br/><br/>So Wonder Woman is a good film and I would suggest you watch it on the big screen. With this film, DC has finally understood what they need to do in order to make a good film. It has given them a much-needed start. I just hope they don't mess it up in future. Now, I am excited for Justice League."
"jeremiahlhorton","10","15","30","3 June 2017"," The Wait is Over
","Man...<br/><br/>I've had very low expectations for this movie considering the last two were epic failures. However, in Batman vs Superman, Wonder Woman's debut was over the top incredible. The movie ""Wonder Woman"", lives up to its name. With wide commercial success from the trailers, which only shows nothing but a few pieces from the early confrontations, this movie is by far the best of the new DC since the Batman trilogy. Gal Gadot captured every aspect of the character, beauty, strength, and her main weakness towards human beings, showed absolute astonishing acting and talent on the big screen. Visual effects are to die for and there is NO SUB STORY! Which is good so the movie can go right into the action and reasons for things. Action packed after maybe 45 minutes of a slow start getting things into gear, however, the 2 and a half hour movie isn't sluggishly boring and preparing you for eh final finish. No. The heroine takes multiple stands and battles multiple times through out the movie. The movie targets comic book fans, fans of the original, and fans who've never even heard of Wonder Woman. Overall, Wonder Woman is by far the best hands down DC movie to date, with the upcoming Justice League movie, and Marvel's swarm of new movies to wrap up the MCU, DC may still have a chance to make up for the lack of commercial success and revenue. Now stop reading this and go watch Wonder Woman; you won't be disappointed. ðŸ˜…"

","Following Man of Steel, Batman Vs Superman and Suicide Squad we now get the fourth installment in the DC Universe with Wonder Woman. There has been much talk about the quality of the first movies especially Batman Vs Superman, but let it be known now - Wonder Woman is better than any of the other DC movies and it surely gives new hope to the DC universe.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is brilliant as the idealistically and honorable woman, brought up among amazon warriors on a remote island. Forced into the world by her idealism and her desire to help those in need she joins up with Chris Pine who plays the role of Steve Trevor with the same gusto as he plays Captain Kirk in Star Trek.<br/><br/>This is a great origin story for Wonder Woman and it seems a lot more detailed and involved than Man of Steel did for Superman. <br/><br/>Patty Jenkins has shown herself to be the right choice as a director of this movie - I personally can't help but wonder ( no pun intended ) if it's because this script was ""rumored to be"" locked almost a year before so no rewrites, no major changes etc - exactly the things the other DC movies are fighting with.<br/><br/>The words of Morgan Freemans character in Shawshank Redemption describes my feelings for this movie:<br/><br/>I find I'm so excited that I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. <br/><br/>And for the future of DC:<br/><br/>-""I hope!"""

","I love this movie. I have been a fan of Wonder Woman for some time and this film really does her justice. She has been around for 75 years and finally in 2017 she gets her own film! The pacing is great, the music is great, the actors are great, the colour schemes are great. I came out of the cinema so happy at how this film had portrayed Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot is a a perfect casting choice and Chris Pine is great as Steve Trevor. The WWI setting I found really interesting and unique for a superhero movie, it worked really well. Patty Jenkins did an excellent job!!! I thought some of the CGI could use a touch up and there could be less slow motion, but apart from that it's a wonderful film."
"hacantyapradipta","9","17","35","24 July 2017"," DCEU's savior has arrived
","At this point, it's totally understandable (And perhaps recommendable) for DC/WB to follow the formulaic superhero guidebook. Training montage, death of a close person to the protagonist, the usual ""join me, humans are not equal to us"", and even some actual humors (No, there was absolutely no real humor in the previous 3 DCEU movies)!<br/><br/>But boy did it work so well! The villain and the sidekicks might be a bit forgettable, but this movie will be the one remembered for the one that probably single-handedly changed general public's perception of DCEU. After the just OK Man of Steel and the less-than-mediocre duo of BvS and Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman is the one that we sorely needed."
"kostas1980","7","17","35","2 July 2017"," An entertaining movie
","I found this movie quite entertaining. Despite it's over two hours duration someone can watch it with pleasure. I found many common things to the Captain America's movie as well as to the God of War action game with a female character instead. The movie introduce us to the world of the Amazons. A female warrior society where young Diana grows up. The photography of beautiful landscapes and world war industrial cities is tied to the movie's atmosphere. Costumes and vehicles too. Dialogs are pretty simply but they are not redundant most of the time. Gal Gadot's and Chris Pine's chemistry is good. She is a strong female personality but at the same time she possesses a lot of compassion for the human suffering caused by the war and therefore they have a common ground. Acting performances are not great but they are not bad either. Everyone has it's own separate role and they are all tied up together. Choreographies are impressive with tension and quite natural moves for CGI. The soundtrack and the sound effects are suitable to the movie's theme. It is an amusing superhero movie in general which introduces us the wonder woman, a member of the upcoming DC's justice league movie."
"sivadparks-89786","10","17","35","2 June 2017"," I hated BvS yet this hit me emotionally.
","Superheroes in the comics were written to be these larger than life heroes that save you from those you can't fight, but inspire to fight those who you can. Wonder Woman in this movie embodies that.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie I was worried. The way the action was cut was strange, they had unnecessary slow motion, the dialogue was a bit off and the story seemed like it was going to fall into a clichÃ© route.<br/><br/>Yet, as the movie continued, the themes of nobility, honor and sacrifice came into fruition and it became a battle of morals. When she first runs into the battle field, it's an awesome moment to watch, but they had been building up the idea that honor is fighting your own battle to protect others without hesitation and it lands.<br/><br/>At the end, you learn who the villain is and this has definitely gotten the most flack. However, this stuck with me best because Wonder Woman assumes her duty to save men from an ""indestructible"" threat. Meanwhile, they make their own personal sacrifices, validating the journey, filled with slow, thoughtful moments, to get there.<br/><br/>This left me inspired because of how well the creators realized the symbolic significance of the characters, both Wonder Woman and her fitting companion Steve Trevor."

","Wonder Woman is incredible! It is very well written, edited, and directed. Patty Jenkins gives the audience an adventure they will never forget. Unlike other DC Movies, it is not slow, or just filled with action, but has the perfect combination of comedy, romance, and adventure. Gal Gadot is breathtaking. She perfectly delivers the innocence of Diana and her difficult journey as she finds out how cruel human beings can be. Another great thing about the movie is the partnership between Diana and Steve. The teammates trust each other and help each other out, knowing they are both capable of doing the same things. Steve trusts Diana's instincts, and is afraid she might get overwhelmed with how different the world is. Whilst Diana struggles to understand his emotions and his constant desire to protect her. The chemistry between the actors is obvious, and their journey together is worth watching. But, the most important thing is the lesson of the movie. We live in a world were most superheroes are male. Women are either sidekicks or damsels in distress. The world is changing, and Wonder Woman shows the younger generations that girls can also be heroes. Definitely my favorite movie of the year!

","Despite that fact that ""Wonder Woman"" came out in the summer of 2017, it took me until nearly December to finally watch it. The reason? I had almost reached the end of my rope with DC Universe movies. I hated ""Man of Steel"", ""Suicide Squad"" was a well-polished disappointment, and ""Batman vs Superman"" was almost comically inept. As such, I really had no desire to give DC films any more of my time. However, with all the good ""WW"" reviews and word-of-mouth, I finally relented (it being released in 4K helped tremendously on that front). What I found was a surprisingly competent and entertaining film that (at least for a moment) breathes a little bit of new life into the DC film franchise.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Wonder Woman"" tells the story of Diana (Gal Gadot), a woman living on an island of Amazons whose sole purpose are to protect the world from Ares, the God of War. While training to become a warrior, Diana witnesses the crashing of a military plane piloted by WWI spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). When he explains the state of the world to Diana (the scope of WWI), she is convinced that Ares must be acting through German general Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and his demented chemist Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya). As such, Diane defies her people and leaves the island, wishing to be brought to the Front of the war to take on Ares herself.<br/><br/>The fact that the plot of this film is set up so simply really serves ""Wonder Woman"" well, I think. Instead of trying to create a complicated scenario, director Patty Jenkins realizes that the success of the movie hinges on the character interactions, overall message, and action sequences.<br/><br/>Let's take a quick look at those things one at a time:<br/><br/>-The action sequences are thrilling. DC always does a good job with that. -The overall message is one of positivity and hope. Because Diana is so foreign to our culture, her viewpoint of humanity is quite instructive and fuels much of the movie. -The character interactions are the hallmark of the film, however. Gadot & Pine have incredible chemistry, and their scenes carry much of the experience.<br/><br/>Is ""Wonder Woman"" a perfect film? No. A few things came off as a bit too silly for me, and it isn't really as deep as, say, ""Batman Begins"" was. But considering where the DC universe films were heading, ""WW"" is a HUGE step back in the right direction.<br/><br/>I'm still wary of pretty much all things DC (I have not and will not see ""Justice League"" in theaters), but ""Wonder Woman"" stood out in a good way. Put Zack Snyder behind the camera again and it all probably comes crashing down. But in the Jenkins-led ""Wonder Woman"", it mostly worked."
"Quinoa1984","8","8","14","18 November 2017"," ::Blazing guitar solo::
","Seeing this again... man (or woman)... I want to rate this even higher for the parts I like, even for the opening on Themyscyra (sic) because I bought in even more to the emotion of how it was played so straight by the actors and staged by Jenkins. Gal Gadot is the new Christopher Reeve, and in her own way even more badass because of how much she makes Diana a force to be reckoned with while keeping so much vulnerability just under the surface. She and Chris Pine are a wonderful 30's or 40's rom com couple, though more adorable due to Diana's mix of awkwardness and strength, often in the same breath.<br/><br/>.... But that climax is still not impressive on a technical level. I don't even mean how the conflict has to come to a head, I get all of that, and I even liked the I BELIEVE IN A THING CALLED LOVE (cue guitar lick) moment because Jenkins is not only not afraid of cheese she doesn't know what the word means, but it connects with the key theme of the movie. I know so many of the final battle scenes or fights that happen with these comic book movies have been called bullshit but a) there were less than zero stakes because (Spoiler) we know Wonder Woman doesn't succumb to evil because of her appearance in the previous DC movie that takes place 100 years after this one (and I so wish it didn't exist due to the continuity errors it places with this), and b) the CGI is laughable, with David Thewlis (who you ALL owe it to yourselves to see on Fargo s.3) not being good at turning total evil HAM.<br/><br/>So in short: the parts I liked before I liked a little or a lot more (the 'No Man's Land' is the one part, mostly when Diana first appears, that, just iconography-wise, is cool), and the parts I didn't I felt so, so, so embarrassed. Hence this review and half a star bump. It's also the best DC comic book movie since Batman Begins. So there."

","Dear readers, yesterday I watched Wonder Woman and it is obviously beyond my expectation. I am directly becoming a fan, because before watching it, I never have an idea about who is Wonder Woman. Furthermore, in Wonder Woman movie, my eyes can not go to admire the figure of Wonder Woman itself, that had been perfectly played by Gal Gadot. I know Gal Gadot from Fast&Furious, but in Wonder Woman movie, she is the essence, the soul, and the beauty of the movie. Gal Gadot opens the timing for woman again becoming the core of superhero movie! Here I do not want to discuss about the Plot, because the plot is ordinary, just like other superhero movie, but I want to discuss about the characters inside the plot. First is the Wonder Woman. Oh my God, she is powerful, gorgeous, beautiful, charismatic, she is the future dream of every woman of this real life. Besides her destiny to become hero, Wonder Woman is learning about human life, especially Love and Dignity. Many times in the scenes, you can see how Wonder Woman react about Humanity, War, Peace, and Politic of human being in the most dangerous history: World War II. Yet, the epic conspiracy to make Peace coming more longer than before. Wonder Woman can prove herself to be independent and to follow the light inside herself, without intervened by surroundings and can clearly see who is the real enemy and the real hero. In this movie, you can also see other characters around Wonder Woman, but it is herself that lead the role and make different of each scene. I love Gal Gadot before, and this Wonder Woman movie makes no other female actress could combine to her unique figure. Congratulation to the Director and all crews that can maintain the meaning of superhero movies and also the effects that are really captured in each battle. LOVE THIS MOVIE!"

An easy to follow plot but not too simple, well stuck touches of humor and a ""recyclable"" villain, as well as the impressive special effects make for the viewer this movie all along enjoyable.<br/><br/>Under the great direction of Patty Jenkins and, despite many wouldn't like to hear this, Zach Snyder does a wonderful job as a scriptwriter, DC brings a story centered in a flashback, where we can see the princess Diana and her development process to become Wonder Woman. The interesting thing about this story, despite focusing on the First World War and showing without hesitation the human evil, is that the values that they want to convey with this character are that there are still things to fight for. The same idea that was present in Henry Cavill Superman but with a much better result.<br/><br/>In terms of performance, no one can deny that Gal Gadot is the perfect Wonder Woman, a flawless performance, where she shows throughout the film how her character is gradually maturing. The touches of humor fit her perfectly and makes her character trustworthy, a woman without fear that fights against any opposition and with very clear values, perfection.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of the character that we were already introduced in Batman v Superman makes you sense very powerful action scenes and you feel every movement. <br/><br/>In terms of special effects, CGI is much better introduced here than in Batman v Superman, but they overuse slow motion again, although, the close-ups are perfectly involved.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it is possibly the best film of this DC new universe, but I do not think that they should be limited to this. It is a very good movie of origins but I hope that they continue working and that we see movies with a bigger plot in the future. For the time being, the to-do of the DCEU are the villains, better call Nolan for that."

There were also a few funny hilarious pauses which refreshed and added a lot to the film."
"deny-966-237037","10","18","38","27 August 2017"," Excellent movie, and comments on all the bad reviews
","I was really surprised at all the bad reviews on a movie that has all the right elements for a good action movie: good actors, good direction, a reasonably good script, and that pinch of magic that turns all of these into an actual entertaining movie. And entertaining it is, as show its box office figures - unless you are one of the following types of reviewer:<br/><br/>1. ""Boring"" in the title: we get it, you are a rock star who is secretly a CIA operative, fighting crime, doing high speed pursuits, exploding stuff and killing bad guys with assault rifles. But keep in mind most of us live more mundane lives and thus your incredibly exciting lifestyle can't be used as a reference that's useful to the rest of us.<br/><br/>2. ""Insult to your intelligence"" in the title: okay, so you're both a Nobel prize and Oscar winner, we get it. You're so intelligent that to you the rest of us are like a bunch of apes. WE GET IT. Now if you would please let us apes enjoy our monkey movies that we find entertaining, that would be swell, thank you very much. Next time you write a review though, it would be best if you put a disclosure somewhere saying it's only for people with an IQ above 200 or something.<br/><br/>3. ""Your hate clichÃ© here"" in title: lots of reviews giving bad ratings for various different reasons, but interestingly all of them in sequence, effectively burying the good reviews under a number of pages of bad ones. What could this be? An organized bunch of people upset with the success of a movie whose hero is a tall, lean, beautiful Jewish woman who does not hate all males, perhaps? I wonder who these people might be.<br/><br/>So to sum things up, if you have an agenda or an ego the size of Connecticut, you're probably not going to like this movie, well, at least not admit to it. But if all you're looking for is an entertaining, heart warming and even uplifting movie, definitely go watch it. On a side note, I have always liked superhero movies because they portrait the decision of an individual who, despite having super powers and being able to use them to do pretty much anything he/she wants, still chooses to use them nobly and for the good of others. Personally I would not trust a person who fails to perceive and appreciate the beauty of that kind of attitude."

","While I am a big advocate for Man of Steel and how misunderstood I found that movie to be by many I cannot deny that since then the DCEU has had many issues with Batman Vs Superman and Suicide Squad being deeply flawed movies. While this did dent my confidence in Wonder Woman a but I was still convinced it would be a big improvement and hopefully set this universe back on the right track and thankfully my faith was very well placed. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is without a doubt one of my favourite movies of this year so far and a lot of that has to do with the titular character herself. Gal Gadot is brilliant as her, she brings just the right amount of naivety yet sheer will to this character, she's brilliant in the action sequences and like Ben Affleck before her has proved plenty of her doubters wrong. All the performances in this movie we're solid Chris Pine was great, even though I was a bit disappointed that he didn't enter this universe as Green Lantern he made this character his own and really stood out. David Thewlis brought quite a lot to his character and I liked the good nature of his character. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman had a nice heart to it which I really appreciated. The tone was just right, it was good for this film to go down a more light-hearted direction, I didn't mind the dark tones of MOS and BVS but I don't want non stop darkness, there is room for some lightheartedness that this film had just the right amount of. It did have its more serious and darker moments it felt like there was a good balance between the light and dark that Suicide Squad couldn't quite find. <br/><br/>I've always liked that the DCEU has put there characters first, even if they don't always succeed and this film was no acceptation. Diana and her arc in this film was just right, I liked her primary mission but also a lot of the obstacles she experiences along the way that show her humanity is not a perfect as she would like it to be. I loved Chris Pine's character in this movie, not only was he really funny as well as very entertaining, he had great chemistry with Gal Gadot that made you care even more about his character even if they did take him in some predictable routes. I also really enjoyed the team of men who accompany them, they weren't in the film much but shined when they were and added some much needed levity.<br/><br/>I loved the World War One setting of this movie, it let this movie stand on its own truly apart for the rest of the universe. They didn't really shy away from some of the horrors of this war and tied it in nicely with its main plot. It also gave director Patty Jenkins a chance to really shine, she directed this film fantastically, she took to the action sequences very well making them seem somewhat real as well as gritty. <br/><br/>My biggest issue with this movie was it's villainous characters, I liked there designs and were good in the action set pieces but they felt quite conventional and under-utilised. Often there'd just be scenes cutting back to them talking ominously about there lack of time or there evil plans, it felt a bit jarring compared to the rest of the film and most of there plot line doesn't truly come to ahead until the final act. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a step back in the right direction for the DCEU, it had terrific action sequences with solid characters played very by the actors and actresses portraying them, it had a good heart to it that benefited the lighter tone while not being without its darker moments. It did have issues with its villains but that's a small price to pay for a truly fantastic experience that feels like a good half way between the DCEU's haters and its supporters. <br/><br/>9.1/10-A (Phenomenal)"

","First I wanna say, 'Bravo, that you are finally getting it right'. It's been a very long time since a decent DC movie has came out and this movie, Wonder Woman, is beyond decent, it's phenomenal. Far to long, DC, with major help from Zack Snyder, have been given us weak and poorly written superhero films that dragged just as bad a Transformers: Age of Extinction. Now, I know that Zack Snyder had a hand in writing this film but I also know he was not alone. Two other writers, Allan Heinberg and Jason Fuchs helped. Thank you guys so much. I also noticed that Heinberg wrote the Screenplay. So even though Snyder had a hand in writing the story, Heinberg writing the screenplay is what mostly helped the film along with the Director, Patty Jenkins. Also, just want to point out, I believe this is the first time a female has directed a major superhero film and it was exactly what was needed.<br/><br/>Sound/Music| The sound in this film was top notch. The horses, ocean waves, arrows flying in the air, thunder, it all was used correctly. There are many times in the film thunder is heard and it feels real. The clash of swords and the sound of bullets and bombs are crisp. It was intriguing to my ears. The music was so well placed and very different from DC films. At times I felt I may have been watching a Marvel film. All music is placed at the right time with the right mood. It really helped set the tone. Especially Wonder Woman's theme song. There is a part where whatever instrument that is drags and sounds as though there is trouble, turmoil, war, and fear wrapped up in one. Applause to the composer.<br/><br/>Costume/Sets| The costumes seem so real. It looked as though they were wearing real armor of metal. I'm not sure if they, the Amazons, were, but if so, it would explain why they walked and carried their self as they did. The German, British, Native American, Moroccan attire and more were very accurate. The makeup was very good also. Very realistic. I only know they wore makeup because I know how they look regularly. The sets were well placed also, very believable. There was only one scene that needed work in this area and it was the scene where they set camp in the woods. Someone told me the CGI on the Amazons' island was bad, but I honestly didn't notice and it could be because it was an extension and not totally CGI.<br/><br/>Acting| The acting was very good. There were parts where I honestly cried. It's very rare I cry in a superhero film but it connected and in that 2 hour and 21 minute movie the director and writers had me connect to Steve Trevor. Not just him but all characters. They carried on as though they were really Generals and soldiers. Gadot and Pine had a good chemistry along with the Amazons and the others Gadot's character comes in contact with. With the training Samantha Jo said all the actors who were Amazons had, it's no wonder they seemed to truly have a bond.<br/><br/>Story | This was a very captivating story. There was so much to cover and Patti Jenkins along with Allan Heinberg did wonderful covering it. It starts off in present day, where Diana receives something that makes her reminisce about the past. From there, it gives us a look at her as a child and the vigor she possessed. The young actress did very well portraying a child who is innocent yet curious and determined. In this part, Part A, background is given about how the Amazons came to be and who the villain is. It shows Diana as she ages and the love that her mother, Hippolyta, has for her. Like any mother she wants to protect her daughter, but Diana is not like others. In this section of the movie all is well for a while until the first male character is introduced. Here, in the transitioning period we get to see the Amazons at their finest. What a fight scene indeed. From there things become dark and serious, but there are jokes here and there, and good ones at that.<br/><br/>From this point, Part B, Diana is assimilating to the outside world. She experiences the gender separation and belittlement of women in this society. Along with this, more of her abilities. Then we eventually get to Part C, where Diana experiences war the way the outside world has. This is where she shows out and becomes a known hero along with her comrades. One thing I find satisfying and very different between her and Captain American among others is she is very humble and honorable. She never takes full credit. If she is helped in any way by others it is ""we"" and not ""I"". I love that! In Part C/C.5 there comes a part where she gets an understanding that everyone has something that they sacrifice and deal with. Many thought provoking dialogues. If we fast forward we get to the pre-climax. Diana finally gets to her target and completes her mission and confused and unraveled that war still persists. Steve comforts and encourages her yet she dismisses him. He, being an honorable man does what he must and then the twist I was expecting but not entirely happens. I won't say anything except that at the end of the film a tear will be shed. If not the men, surely the women.<br/><br/>I hope you go see Wonder Woman. You will not be disappointed. If you are and love Marvel films it is mostly a bias or can be due to the many films DC has released and have disappointed. This film is not one of those. Go out and give this film some love. Patti Jenkins did great!!"
"GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator","8","11","21","3 June 2017"," Wonder Woman - An aspiring, relevant film that needs to be seen
","The DCEU has been a difficult film franchise for me to get invested. Man of Steel I actually enjoyed as a standalone film despite having flaws. However BVS suffered from missing the point of having two superheroes fight each other and then Suicide Squid becoming a disappointment in every possible way. Wonder Woman is for the first time a DC film since the Dark Knight I can talk more about it's strength then its faults.<br/><br/>Unlike these past two DCEU films, Wonder Woman doesn't have a plot that is unnecessarily complex but is still able to show the physical, political and emotional blockades that stand in the way of Diana's simple goal of killing Ares, the god of war. The film starts as this beautiful fantasy epic where we see Diana grow up on her island home Themyscira and once Steve Trevor arrives it makes a natural transition into this gritty war story. While the dark aspect of the WW1 setting isn't sugarcoated, it is well balanced with strong light-hearted moments. The movie's story never tries to be just black and white and shows through Diana's perspective, a warrior woman who lived a sheltered life and believes a supernatural force is behind the war, that humans are complex beings who are capable of doing both the worst and best deeds by their own intentions.<br/><br/>What truly is outstanding is the majority of the main cast. In BVS, Gal Gadot didn't blow me away as much as a lot of other people did because of how small and forced in her role was but that has changed now. Gadot has proved she is Wonder Woman. It is now impossible for me to seen this character being played by another actress. While there were a few lines where she struggled with her acting, Gadot overall brings a very emotionally strong and charming performance. The way she expresses can say so much about her character's mentality without having to say one word. Her performance shows that Diana is a woman who is confident enough to not be swayed by a man's advances nor undermined by orders but she still shows this innocent curiosity about the outside world. Chris Pine also was surprisingly great in a supporting role. In the beginning I almost thought he was going to be playing Captain Kirk again but he showed a lot more complexity then I was expecting. The squad of side characters played by Ewen Bremner, SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui and Eugene Brave Rock offered some fun banter while the film does give some time to understand their own reasons for the fighting in the war. Connie Nielson and Robin Wright as Diana's mother and aunt worked well to show the two parental figures that defined Diana's upbringing. I will say however I felt like there should have been more Robin Wright in this movie.<br/><br/>The real hero however is director Patty Jenkins. As someone who recently watched her previous feature film Monster which came out 14 years ago, it is shocking to me that it has taken this long for her to get a directing gig like this. Jenkins shoots action like it is a beautiful piece of artwork. Just like Zack Snyder, she shoots slow-motion sequences but they never feel like they are being overused or just trying to look cool. The scenes feel like a Greek painting coming to life from the first action sequence on the beaches of Themyscira to the moment Diana enters the battlefield on No Man's Land. But Jenkins never gets lost in the action. She knows that this is Wonder Woman's origin so she puts the perfect amount of time and effort to build up Diana's growth as a character. And this helps to make the romance with Steve Trevor feel natural instead of being obligatory. When they meet it's not love as first sight but they eventually connect through their belief and faith in humanity. When there is no action, she uses light humor to explore how these characters function with one another and doesn't just play it for laughs to defuse the tension.<br/><br/>The one major flaw from previous superhero movies that Wonder Woman does not surpass is the group of uninteresting villains. Danny Huston as the German general Ludindorf was nothing more then DC's attempt at making a carbon-copy version of Red Skull. It is especially the case when he gets super- human strength to fight Wonder Woman. And here is when I am about to go into spoilers. David Thewlis is a great actor and gives a good performance as the peace negotiator Sir Patrick Morgan but his reveal as the war god Ares comes to no surprise and I felt that more could have been done to explore that side of his character. It is particular disappointing when it doesn't match up to his other villain role in Fargo season 3. And the fight between him and Diana in the end felt detached from the first two major grounded and practical battles I described previously when it got a little too fantastical and cg-heavy. Luckily the final battle can be forgiven because it becomes motivated by Diana's evolution as a character.<br/><br/>Other then boring villains and a cg boss fight, Wonder Woman is pretty much a near flawless film. While it doesn't top the Dark Knight or this year's Logan, Wonder Woman is an aspiring film that can leave with you a lot of relevant and good things to talk about after seeing it."
"phd_travel","10","23","51","1 June 2017"," Amazingly well done - Gal Gadot is a star!
","Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish this is the most well made of the recent superhero movies.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is perfect for the role, so beautiful she makes every scene she is in watchable, yet sweet enough to be endearing and statuesque enough to be convincing as an Amazon goddess. She really has the chance to shine here that she didn't have in the Furious movies. Thank goodness they cast her instead of some other less convincing actress. Chris Pine as the spy who brings her to War. They look fine together even if they could have cast a slightly younger actor.<br/><br/>The story is clever, blending her origins with World War I. Liked the humor interspersed which felt quite spontaneous and not corny at all. Managed to incorporate enough things from the original series like the wrist bands and lasso. but not the plane and spinning around.<br/><br/>Beautiful production from the stunning Mediterranean isle to London. I read that the look of the movie was inspired by the painter John Singer Sargent and there is a painterly quality in the color palate and art direction that makes the historic setting very attractive - look online for his paintings of WWI soldiers and the painting ""Gassed"".<br/><br/>The battle in the Western Front is the most exciting WWI trench warfare battle sequence I have seen. It doesn't matter that it's fantasy - it was thrilling.<br/><br/>Villains here are pre Nazi era Germans - they just can't get a break on screen. The ending is grand - maybe a few explosions could have been cut.<br/><br/>For sure the blockbuster movie of 2017."
"TheOneThatYouWanted","1","67","171","27 May 2017"," Direct-To-Video at best
","So yeah. The film starts off like a bad episode of Xena Warrior Princess with a laughable battle sequence sporting a zillion stupid slowmo shots. Then the actress playing Wonder Woman gives a laughable performance. She can not even pronounce the name of her stupid mentor on her deathbed. And what is up Wonder Woman's strength? In one scene she is punching a tank and in the next she is getting overpowered by a normal human man. And she is ordered around and dragging like a rag doll during battles... and this was sold as a female empowerment movie? Seriously, people are just idiots. A few paid off movie critics calling this a good movie doesn't mean you have to mindlessly follow suit. For Pete's sake, think for yourselves people."

","When WW 1 comes to The Amazon Island we see a plane crash in the ocean and Diana (Gal Gadot) who is in Amazon training, knows she must leave. Later she discovers her true powers and becomes Wonder Woman. Keep in mind she is a Goddess, but she is not aware of that yet. <br/><br/>This is what we have been waiting for and it doesn't disappoint. This is terrific Entertainment at its best. Those of us who grew up reading comics of Superman, Batman and others are taken back into believing all this is possible and it is here that we want to believe once again. And so we do.<br/><br/>We see a young Diana watching a plane crash in the ocean. She dives in and saves the Pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). With her Amazon sisters she helps defeat the Germans who were after Steve Trevor. Later he tells the community of the war and millions dying because of it. Diana feels she must go and help and defeat Ares (God of War) who she believes is causing all this misery in the world and once he is dead peace will come upon the world. Her mother Antiope (Robin Wright) reluctantly lets her go with Steve Trevor. <br/><br/>It was fun seeing Diana experience some of society and learn about it. Steve had promised to take her to the war and eventually they both go. Once at the front all bets are off and Diana goes and does her thing and it is here we see her destroy the enemy. This goes on from time to time defeating the enemy, but the main goal is to find and destroy the building where Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya) also known as Dr poison is making poison gas that will kill millions more. <br/><br/>The choreography and CGI is something to behold when Diana goes into action and we never tire of it. They are that good along with the heart rendering music. Kudos. <br/><br/>Diana is surprised and disappointed when she kills General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) who she believed was Ares and the war didn't stop.<br/><br/>Of course there is a twist in here and you may be surprised about it. We see the real Ares (David Thewlis) show up and he fights Diana to the death. Ares tells Diana that only a God can kill another God and does she have what it takes. These fighting scenes are like something we have rarely or never have seen in other movies. Kudos again.<br/><br/>This was a solid production and deserving of all Awards it receives. The acting by all and cinematography were excellent.<br/><br/>Kudos to Patty Jenkins who directed this movie. Fantastic job. <br/><br/>All in all this was a special treat for we Believers in comic book heroes and we hope to see many sequels in time with the same Gal Gadot who we fell in love with. (yes, I can see that) (10/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

","From the moment the camera swooped in over the Amazons in training I sighed and sat back in anticipation of a movie at last where women weren't just side-kicks, handbags or sick and twisted nutters but powerful good leaders a la Boadicea. I wasn't disappointed. What a good entertaining fun movie. Brilliant choice of actress for WW and Chris Pine was perfect casting for the old fashioned hero role, he played it spot on. Pure escapism with an entertaining story, and a great heroine as well,DC has a real winner here. I think Diana appealed to me so much because of her lack of cynicism, a bit along the style of Superman and Captain America. She was shocked at how people treated each other and especially so when confronting the real baddies of the piece. It's nice to see someone fighting for good without clever smart-alec comments streaming from them. She was fighting evil with the seriousness that it deserved. My favourite standout scene was the brilliantly filmed attack by the Germans against the Amazons. Enough swords and arrows to satisfy any fantasy tragic and believable fighting, you felt the effort and pain. And please an award of some sort for that incredible WW theme music, from the moment it played in Batman vs Superman it was a powerful winner. But how oh how did anyone say Dr Poison without cracking up; even if not faithful to the original comics this villain really needed a new name."
"zardoz-13","8","13","26","18 June 2017"," Wonderful!
","The Adam West & Burt Ward ""Batman"" (1966) movie qualified as the first costume-clad crime fighter epic of the modern era. Although women have figured prominently in all superhero sagas, DC Comics' latest superhero origins epic ""Wonder Woman"" marks only the fifth big-screen actioneer that a woman has been cast as the title character. Earlier entries included ""Supergirl"" (1984) with Helen Slater; ""Tank Girl"" (1995) with Lori Petty; ""Catwoman"" (2004) with Halle Berry; and ""Elektra"" (2005) with Jennifer Garner. Unfortunately, these four films failed to recoup their respective budgets at the box office and never prompted sequels. (Before in the 1970s, Lynda Carter broke the TV barrier and portrayed William Moulton Marston's comic book creation Wonder Woman. She cavorted about a starry, patriotic costume with lots of cleavage for three seasons. For the record, the Wonder Woman character made her debut in DC Comics in their All-Star Comics in December 1941.) Anyway, ""Wonder Woman"" is the only superhero movie about a heroine that has been both a smashing critical and commercial success. Finally, little girls and feminists alike have a larger-than-life heroine as a role model to applaud in the eternal struggle against evil. Meantime, Warner Brothers should have released ""Wonder Woman"" before ""Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice."" The earlier blockbuster introduced audiences to the iconic Amazon warrior Princess Diana (Israel model Gal Gadot) with her incandescent Lasso of Truth and her ritualistic sword--something like King Arthur's Excalibur--who came to the rescue in the darkest hour of need to vanquish Lex Luthor's genetically mutated monster Doomsday. Sadly, Wonder Woman tangles with an adversary far less menacing than Doomsday in ""Monster"" director Patty Jenkins' ""Wonder Woman."" Instead, she clashes with Zeus' son--the wicked God of War Ares--and triumphs over him. Primarily Indeed, ""Wonder Woman"" is a movie told in flashback about the formative years of the heroine's life and the photograph taken of her with her ordinary male companions in World War I. Actress Gal Gadot will erase any memories of Lynda Carter, and ""Wonder Woman"" ranks as a spectacular movie until she scrimmages with Ares who resembles the Wizard of Oz's Tin Man high on bath salts. Apart from that predictable climactic clash with Ares, ""Wonder Woman"" ranks as an exciting, first-rate adventure opus about our heroine shedding her naÃ¯ve innocence as she blunders through an amoral world.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" unfolds in contemporary Paris, at the illustrious Louvre Museum. Diana works as a Curator in the Department of Antiquities. A Wayne Enterprises armored car pulls up, and a uniformed guard delivers a locked valise to her office. Diana recognizes Bruce Wayne's logo on it. Opening the valise, she admires a sepia-colored daguerreotype of her in her Wonder Woman outfit with four troubleshooters posed with her. The significance of the photograph is that Wayne Enterprises, a.k.a. Batman, has sent her the original copy. The picture revives Diana's memories about her youth on the enchanted Uptonian island of Themyscira. Eight-year old Diana (newcomer Lilly Aspell) pleads to be an Amazon warrior, but her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen of ""Gladiator"") refuses to let her sister Antiope (Robin Wright of ""Forrest Gump"") train her to be a warrior. Hippolyta warns her daughter, ""Fighting doesn't make you a hero."" Later, she calls Diana ""the most precious thing in this world"" to her. ""I sculpted you from clay myself and begged Zeus to give you life."" Eventually, Hippolyta relents but tells Antiope that Diana must be the best Amazon on the island. Moreover, she should be able to defeat even Antiope. Predictably, Diana (Gal Gadot of ""Fast Five"") emerges from her training as the greatest Amazon ever. Initially, when Zeus created the island haven for the Amazons, he made it virtually impossible for anybody to find it. As she is standing on a cliff one day, Diana spots a plane as it penetrates the shield surrounding the island. The aircraft plummets into the ocean, and Diana plunges into the deep. She rescues a pilot from the sinking plane and carries him to the beach. Just as he recovers from the crash, Diana's mother Hippolyta and her warriors ride up on a cliff overlooking the beach and spot German ships breaking through the invisible barrier. Squads of German soldiers in the Kaiser's Imperial Army storm the beach and open fire on the Amazons. The intrepid pilot, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine of ""Star Trek Beyond""), seizes a rifle from a soldier while the Amazon warriors let arrows galore fly at the Germans. Incredibly, the Amazons repulse them! Later, they learn from Trevor that he is an American secret agent working for the British. Moreover, he has stolen a valuable notebook from a notorious German chemist, Dr. Mara (Elena Anaya of ""Van Helsing""), who is testing a poison gas that will alter the outcome of the conflict.<br/><br/>The refreshing thing about ""Wonder Woman"" is her origins haven't been told ad infinitum like ""Superman,"" ""Batman,"" and ""Spider-man."" In fact, the set-up on Themyscira is one of the better parts, especially director Patty Jenkins' choreography of the German invasion and the bow and arrow wielding Amazons. Anyway, Diana learns about the global tragedy of World War I and decides the only way the war will end is when she slays Ares. Diana promises to help Steve Trevor escape from Themyscira if he will usher her to the war. She takes the Lariat of Hestia, an incandescent rope that prompts captives in this twine to utter only the truth, her magical bracelets, and an impressive sword nicknamed 'the Godkiller.' The next best scene occurs on a World War I battlefield. Wonder Woman emerges from the trenches and enters no-man's land. Germans from everywhere greet her with a hail of gunfire. She uses her magical bracelets to deflect their bullets. Gal Gadot acquits herself as well here as the eponymous character as she did in ""Batman Vs Superman."" Altogether, ""Wonder Woman"" amounts to a dame good movie!"

","After what seems like an eternity of the trailer scene at a beach where Diana gazes down at Steve utters ""You're a man"", we finally get to see the entire 140 minutes of Wonder Woman begins - entirely satisfying, for many reasons. Indisputably, the most important is Gal Gadot. But it takes two to tango, and Chris Pine deserves almost as much recognition.<br/><br/>Reincarnated from Gisele (""Fast and furious"" franchise), Gadot finally found an opportunity to prove that she is not just a pretty face plus a lethal body. In ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016) Diana/Wonder Woman was previewed as an icon. Now, in her own full feature, she demonstrates why she is the best choice for Diana, the real person. Mind you, she isn't exactly an ordinary person (no spoiler here). But in the movie, she goes through the metamorphosis of understanding and adopting mankind. As a movie character, she ably portrays innocence, sophistication (erudite from books), sweetness, goodness, determination, doubt, humour, flippancy, and more.<br/><br/>The physical conflicts showcased throughout the movie are second to none. But the biggest conflict is in Diana herself, trying to hold on to her childhood belief that once you destroy Ares the evil God of War, all atrocities will end. Saving mankind therefore is something absurdly simple to her. She does not believe what many others (man and gods) tell her, that mankind is not worth saving. Realisation that mankind comes with light and dark which are cannot be inseparable is agonisingly frustrating. Finally, witnessing one heroic act of self-sacrifice, she come to the true realisation, and embraces mankind as it is, knowing that in the very end, one thing makes everything worthwhile: love.<br/><br/>The macro backdrop reminds you of Captain America, WWI. The establishing scenes are set at a well-hidden island Themyscira created by Zeus to develop a race of Amazons as safeguard against the return of the above-mentioned Ares. Princess Diana, we soon learn, is not an Amazon, a mild suspense. Plot is neatly forwarded when Diana recues British spy Steve, who intimates that a man-made catastrophe is imminent if the Germans are not stopped in time. Believing that Ares is behind all these, Diana teams up with Steve heading first to London where a booklet of secret code stolen from the enemies is to be deciphered. It turns out that poison gas is the name of the game.<br/><br/>My summary line is an unreserved compliment on this movie. Out of the ""everything"", however, what I enjoy most, a delightful surprise, is the scene in London. If you remember ""Kate & Leopold"", (2001), this is something similar, yet not exactly the same â€“ a sort of stranger in a strange land setup. Diana knows everything and yet knows nothing. The sit-com is near perfect. The chemistry between Gadot and Pine is magical. Visually, Gadot is seen in a most unrevealing, almost unisex outfit befitting the fashion of 1910s London. She is absolutely stunning. This light, humorous interludes take ""Wonder Woman"" one notch above the two superheroes in whose company she made her debut.<br/><br/>Next, at the cheerless, dreary frontline trenches of Belgium, often bitterly known as ""No Man's Land"", the more serious side takes over. I'll stop here on plot development which I have actually covered, albeit with a broad stroke, earlier. While there is nothing here that you have not seen before, this rendition in this movie is top-notch, both direction and acting.<br/><br/>Let me close with some comments on the rest of the cast that generally delivers good support, albeit not uniformly. At the beginning, Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright are mother and aunt of Diana respectively, each bringing her own charm to a character that fade from the scene after the establishing sequence.<br/><br/>In the main body of the story, at the British side, talented David Thewlis, probably best known for his role in the Harry Potter ( Remus Lupin benevolent werewolf), plays a somewhat enigmatic British politician, dishing out a few surprises. Lucy Davis as Steve's secretary is simply lovable in the light middle segment.<br/><br/>At German side, Danny Huston's General Ludendorff, believed by Diana to be Ares manifested in human form, has been given little depth, and for good reasons. Spanish actress Elena Anaya sacrifices her beauty to play the horribly disfigured ""mad doctor"" is also unfortunately a stereotype.<br/><br/>Well deserved mentioning is the eccentric trio recruited to assist our heroes in the deadly mission. The eccentricity provides good comedy, but towards the end the warmth beneath each shine through in heart-felt rapport with Diana: Ewen Bremner as a Scottish sniper, Eugene Brave Rock as scouting expert ""The Chief"" and Said Taghmaoui as a man-of-all-trades possible from Turkey."

","Not since Christopher Reeve first played Superman has an actor truly embodied a superhero, until now. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is earnest and believable. Is the film perfect? No, but it's few flaws are easily forgotten by the obvious heart and soul poured into this movie. Long live DC. <br/><br/>PS: The world needs a prequel/spin off movie focused on the Amazons and starring Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen"
"joshbarton15","8","13","26","1 June 2017"," The DCEU goes back to basics and it works wonders.
","As a character, Wonder Woman has been around since 1941, which makes it even more crazy to think that she has never had her own film released in cinemas. That is, until now. The fourth film of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), which has been pretty lacklustre so far, Wonder Woman is a film that couldn't come at a more relevant time.<br/><br/>When American pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes on the island of Themyscira, he meets Diana (Gal Gadot), an Amazonian princess and trained warrior. Upon hearing of the horrors of World War I, Diana leaves her home to fight in the war to end all wars, where she realises her full potential and becomes Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>The DCEU has certainly shown ambition in its short lifespan but each and every one of Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad were weighed down with either destruction porn, convoluted narratives or just plain old bad filmmaking. With Wonder Woman, Patty Jenkins, who just so happens to be the first female to direct a big-budget superhero film, goes back to basics and it truly does work wonders for the DCEU.<br/><br/>Jenkins hasn't made a film since Monster back in 2003, which is astonishing considering how good that film is, yet it feels as if she's been an avid filmmaker since then with just how confidently she unleashes the titular Wonder Woman upon the world. Delivering a basic yet inspiring origin story, Wonder Woman is a film that does justice to such an iconic character, ensuring she remains an empowering female character and role model.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman really does feel like a classic adventure film, where the action sequences drive the film forward however, they do so without sacrificing the narrative. Diana's origin story from her younger years on Themyscira through to her realisation of how horrific mankind can be to one another through fighting in World War I makes for such impactful viewing, Allan Heinberg's screenplay making the audience feel empathy towards Diana.<br/><br/>Heinberg also ensures that we are watching a film based on a comic book with some delightfully funny moments between the film's characters. Seriously, I was taken aback by just how funny Wonder Woman actually ended up being, considering how dark and serious most the DCEU has been previously. The action sequences, particularly the No Man's Land sequence, are so powerful and thrilling, Diana's emotions pouring out through the majority of them, making for a film the audience can connect with more.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Wonder Woman features a lead performance from Gal Gadot that certainly blew away any skepticism I had about her going in to the film. A lot was made of her appearance in Batman v Superman however, now is the right time to properly judge her in the role and she does an amazing job as Wonder Woman. She's powerful when she has to be and wonderfully funny with a fish-out-of-water demeanour akin to the one seen in Thor. I was most impressed with how effectively Gadot displays the naivety and innocence of Diana when it comes to the war, one particular moment making for one of the more emotional moments in a superhero film of recent years.<br/><br/>Chris Pine makes for a great partner for Gadot to share the screen with as Steve Trevor, who Pine plays with a bit of the cockiness we've seen him play Kirk in Star Trek with. The chemistry between the pair makes the love story that plays a major part in the narrative feel much more natural to watch. The rest of the cast, rather disappointingly, felt a little underwhelming, particularly Danny Huston as yet another forgettable villain of a superhero film, and Robin Wright, who gets nowhere near the amount of screen time I was hoping for.<br/><br/>2017 has been a great year for superhero films so far and Wonder Woman ensures that the trend continues, Gal Gadot and Patty Jenkins sharing a working relationship full of passion to deliver a fantastic adventure for such an important character. Wonder Woman is a massive step in the right direction for both the DCEU and women in film."
"geekiousmaximus","8","15","31","29 June 2017"," A Breathe of Fresh Air for DC Movies
","Perhaps it's clichÃ© to say at this point, but DC has not released the greatest movies over the past few years. Man of Steel was OK at best, but nothing to write home about. Batman v Superman was pure, sloppy garbage that lacked focus, and Suicide Squad was just one big hot mess. So, naturally, I was very skeptical going into Wonder Woman. I wanted the film to be good, as I want all films I go see to be good, but I had a sinking feeling that this film was going to disappoint me as all the other DCEU films had. I can safely say that my skepticism was proved wrong because Wonder Woman was a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is as follows. A young woman named Diana, played by Gal Gadot, lives on an Island of Amazon Women named Themyscira, which is hidden from the world of men. All is well and good until a man named Steve Trevor, played by Chris Pine, crash lands on Themyscira and tells the Amazons of World War I and the turmoil the world is in. After hearing this, Diana wishes to join Steve and help him fight in the war as she believes the culprit is really Ares, the god of war. <br/><br/>The character of Diana, or Wonder Woman, was handled very well in this film. It would have been easy for the writers to simply make her another flawless, perfect Mary-sue that never does anything wrong and defeats all adversity with the greatest of ease. However, they decided instead to give her a sort of child like innocence when confronted with the real world. She still has a lot to learn, and she does make mistakes. However, she still emulates all of the good qualities of humanity that we, the viewers, aspire towards. <br/><br/>Actress Gal Gadot was the perfect casting choice for Wonder Woman. Looking back at her career reveals a talent that has been criminally underutilized. Her only big films have been the Fast and Furious movies which have been OK at best and garbage at worst. She also served as an ex-Israeli defense force soldier, which really shines through during the film's action sequences. Watching her dawn the Wonder Woman outfit felt like watching Christopher Reeve dawn the Superman cape, or watching Robert Downey Jr. put on the Iron Man suit for the first time, or watching Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. She is one of those actors that perfectly fits the role. When I looked up on the screen, I didn't see Gal Gadot playing Wonder Woman, I saw Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>The film's supporting cast also brings a lot to the film. Chris Pine was an excellent choice for Wonder Woman's Lois Lane, Steve Trevor. He brings some great comedic relief to the film and has some great comedic timing, but he also serves as Diana's anchor, being more of a realist in regards to Wonder Woman's quest. He isn't just some annoying sidekick who has to be saved all the time, he brings some genuine heart to the role and has some great emotional moments as well.<br/><br/>While many of the film's leading and supporting roles were handled very well, the film does suffer, as seems standard for many superhero movies these days, from having very poor villains. The film has 2 or 3 villains and none of them really stand out. A couple of them have some pretty cool designs, but it just feels like the standard super- villain we've seen in a multitude of Marvel films. <br/><br/>Another major concern I had going into this film was that it was going to be preachy. I was worried that the film was going to pander to the Tumblr Feminist, SJW crowd and hammer in points about men being evil womanizers and women being flawless, perfect beings. I didn't want another Ghostbusters 2016. However, the film was very balanced and level headed with it's message. It empowers women without demonizing men. Not only are the male heroes in the film very warm and likable, but one of the villains, Dr. Poison, is a woman, showing that not only can men be good, but women can be evil. It downplays the gender of the characters and, instead, focuses on their humanity. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman was great. It was a fresh new origin film for a DC character we haven't seen on the big screen yet. Gal Gadot was perfect casting for the role of Wonder Woman, and the supporting cast felt very warm and likable. Though the film does have a few flaws, particularly in the villain department, none of the flaws are great enough to drag the movie down. The story is simple and easy to follow, the action scenes are fast paced and exciting, the lead is bad ass but also sympathetic and easy to relate to, and the supporting cast is supportive and enjoyable. The overused cinema tropes, like the sexist ""She's a Woman and can't do blank"" trope and the ""fish out of water"" trope, are addressed during the film, as they should be, but are not used to the point of being annoying. Of the movies DC has released in their new DCEU lineup, Wonder Woman was the first that I've wanted to see more than once. It is also the first of the DCEU movies that I want to add to my Blu-Ray collection. Wonder Woman was great. If you have not seen it yet, go see it ASAP. You will not be disappointed."
"rannynm","10","15","31","1 June 2017"," Lives up to its Hype
","When this movie was announced, I was super excited, but at the same time, skeptical. Because all the recent DC Movies didn't live up to all the hype. However, once I sat down in the theatre, all comfortable with my popcorn and icee and watched the film, I can say that it is absolutely amazing! It definitely lives up to its potential. Once the movie was over, I started clapping and, after I left the theatre, I realized my hands were red because I had clapped so hard.<br/><br/>The story of this film starts on Themyscira, an island cloaked from society and home to the Amazons. Diana, Princess of the Amazons, finds an allied spy who washed on shore named Steve Trevor. He tells her about the horrors of World War l and she decides to join him to stop The War to End All Wars.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman and, oh my gosh, she is awesome! She is courageous and fierce, but also intelligent and empathetic. She is the perfect role model for every little girl. She is the iconic Wonder Woman! But in all seriousness, all the actors are awesome and really likable. One particular character that didn't get enough screen time was Steve's secretary, Eta Candy, played by Lucy Davis. She is really funny and has some great one liners. She really deserved more time to shine. <br/><br/>The special effects and fight scenes are also extraordinary. During most of the action scenes, I found myself leaning forward, wide-eyed and gripping my seat. Unlike Batman V Superman or Suicide Squad, I could actually SEE what was happening! To me, the best scene in the movie is when Diana, Steve and his crew lead an invasion of a German controlled town and liberate it. The action is so exciting and, when the Wonder Woman theme starts playing, I literally started smiling until the scene was over. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, this film is also extremely hilarious. I was laughing for a good chunk of time. The humor mainly comes from Diana's lack of knowledge of our civilization. There's a really funny scene where Eta tries to give Diana a normal outfit and she kicks and rips the skirt. <br/><br/>I definitely give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. This movie opens in theatres on June 2, 2017. I could say I recommend this movie for comic book fans, but honestly everyone should see this movie. Wonder Woman is an iconic role model and Gal Gadot definitely lives up to the part. Director Patty Jenkins lassoed this hit film and I love that a woman directed it - Girl Power! That's the truth.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Calista B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."

Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is one of the best casting choice i see along side with Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man.Seriously Gal kick ass from start to end with many fun and awesome action scene that i can clearly see that she had to put a lot of hard work in.Knowing it a woman empowerment movie but the guys character in this movie is not that bad either.They funny,likable and some scene involving the romantic relationship between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine that add a lot of emotion into the movie and make it more memorable.I guess the reason why i can't rate this movie 10 starts cause it suffer the same issues as other superheroes movie like genetic plot and weak villain but again this is the first DC movie that i truly enjoy for a long time so i recommend it for everyone"

","It's very good but very different to the rest of the DCMU. All main character have a good solid story arc of their own which is satisfying and helps tie this up in a single film. It hits a different pace to anything in the superhero market at the moment, I can see some people having an issue with that - but it works. Sound is good (if not a little standard) graphics are good with only minor rag doll issues. Some cheesy lines but it's a superhero movie and that's OK! Gal Gadot is a good Wonder Woman, she isn't the all American hero people are expecting, she is the fierce female Amazon that you love from the comics. You can feel Zach Snyders influence in the choreography and fighting style, there are some strong sucker punch vibes flowing though it. There are going to be a lot of confused male viewers that don't 'get it' as seen on the reviews already. But don't be put off this is not another Catwoman. It's worth it, no end credit scene at the end."

","Credit to all involved because Wonder Woman is the first really exceptional piece of work to come out of the DCEU. Warner Bros. Patty Jenkins has crafted a strong origin story and jumping off point for a new Wonder Woman franchise that will hopefully continue for years to come. Gal Gadot puts in an overall strong performance and creates a striking, heroic and compassionate hero and encompasses the major qualities you want Diana/Wonder Woman to have. The film is not without its issues, but it's probably the most cohesive DC superhero movie since Christopher Nolan was working on the Batman franchise."

","Wonder Woman is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a terrific cast. We were all starting to lose hope in the DC Cinematic Universe, and rightfully so, but this film gets everything that the likes of Batman Vs. Superman and Suicide Squad could not succeed in right. It has a great origin story for the character that does not go on for too long and is given enough scope for people who know very little about the character to understand. The tone is also perfect, it takes itself seriously and tells an engaging story, while also remembering to have some fun.<br/><br/>I did think that the finale of the film was a little rushed and could have been fleshed out a lot more. Once the big twist is revealed and the character gets in to what we would call the final ""boss battle"", it went by very fast and got resolved before we got a chance to really get invested. <br/><br/>The cast is all around fantastic, such as David Thewlis in a terrifically layered role and Ewen Bremner bringing great characterisation, as well comic relief. The highlight is without a doubt Gal Gadot, who delivers a performance as Wonder Woman that I believe will truly go on to be iconic, and Chris Pine as Steve Trevor. He had a presence in this role that was very intriguing, it was clear that the character really clicked with him, he was funny and charming. <br/><br/>A widely entertaining superhero film that has a perfect tone that this universe should try to maintain. Engaging and great fun, Wonder Woman is miles better than I expected, largely due to director Kathy Jenkins' unique vision, it is a special movie that is different to most superhero flicks, worth the watch to anyone looking for a good adventure of fantasy film. <br/><br/>When a pilot crash lands in her world, Wonder Woman heads to fight in a war, discovering her true destiny. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Chris Pine"
"danielgravelli","8","12","24","19 June 2017"," Review: Wonder Woman
","The film ""Wonder Woman"" presents us the best narrative constructed for DC since the trilogy of Christopher Nolan, revealing to us with fidelity the trajectory of the unbeatable Diana Prince. The princess of the Amazons, the daughter of Queen Hippolyta, was carved from her own clay by the mother, who asked the gods to give her life (a kind of allusion to the Greek myth of Pygmalion). The girl grew up in love with the little world around her, the hidden Themyscira, a Paradise Island populated only by powerful women. Influenced by her aunt, Antiope, she soon became interested in the lives of these warriors, who train tirelessly to prevent a possible return and rule of Ares, the God of war. In order to be the best among them, she constantly trains to help protect the place where she lives. Nevertheless, the arrival of an injured pilot expands the horizons of Diana and she realizes that its fight is well beyond the island. Convinced that she is the right person to prevent possible chaos in the world, even without knowing all the truths, she sets out to confront her great enemy.<br/><br/>The production - which features names like Zack Snyder (""300"" and ""Steel Man"") and Rebecca Steel Roven (""Batman - The Dark Knights"") - is a real treat for the fans and a big surprise for the rest of the Because it presents a work that addresses important and current issues, without having to fall into the most of it. With an exceptional work done by the team of practical and visual effects, not abusing the possibilities, the film arrives in a shocking way and puts an end to the discussion that DC does not know how to produce films of superheroes.<br/><br/>The script written by Allan Heinberg is very well punctuated. The screenwriter respects the heroine's conception and builds a story with a beautiful dramatic structure, sewing almost perfectly every detail of the narrative. The dialogues, although well elaborated and have a cohesive line of action, become exaggerated at some points in the projection. Something that could be avoided. Patty Jenkins simply breaks through all possible quality barriers with her audacious work on ""Wonder Woman."" His deconstruction of direction is precise and pleasant to see (I would say, to analyze), since his choices of plans dialogue in an authentic, sensitive and fairly balanced way with the plot and the comics. From the brave use of slow motion to precise camera movements, she seeks to leave nothing out of place. Perhaps she misses by releasing an excess of CGI - such as the poorly collated face of the actor who plays Ares, in another person's body and in moments of the fight scenes - but architect a consistent and superior achievement to many other films. <br/><br/>The cast is led by the charismatic and talented Gal Gadot, in the skin of the heroine ""Wonder Woman"". The actress is a great find and has been performing well in some of the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchises and various television series. However, it is here that she proves that she has come to stay. It is safe to say that by giving Diana life, she left such a good impression that it would be difficult to replace her with another actress in the future. Chris Pine (""Star Trek""), plays the pilot Steve Trevor and is also very well on the scene. The same can be said of Saïd Taghmaoui, Ewen Bremner and Connie Nielsen, who exhibit strong constructions and psychological gestures that fit their roles. Robin Wright (""House of Cards""), portrays Antiope effortlessly and instigates us with yet another remarkable work. Meanwhile, David Thewlis (""Harry Potter"" franchise) delivers an excellent character to a certain point in the film that leaves something to be desired with forced intonation. Like Danny Huston and Elena Anaya, like the villains Ludendorff and Dr. Maru. At certain times they end up performing a caricature construction, much like the archetypes created for comics. But they were excesses that could easily be left out.<br/><br/>Matthew Jensen, responsible for the photography of the great ""Chronicle"" and ""Fantastic Four"", proposes here an elegant harmony of colors. His photography direction deconstructs the various parts of the plot and correctly applies the color palettes that reconcile with each other from start to finish. The warm tones create the atmosphere of Paradise Island, showing the natural and architectural beauties of the place. But the gradations of gray reveal a London divided by the dark side of the war and the colors of the great halls. But the war fields, these are taken by a darkening tonality added to a green filter. A proposal that presents a totally psychological evolution photographic, usually used in films of more dramatic content.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" is not only one of the best superhero movies of all time, as it easily goes into gallery of the top ten (or maybe five). It's a consistent, well-developed film and puts DC Comics back on track."
"GrantTDawson","9","12","24","15 June 2017"," Wonder Woman exceeds all expectations.
","Wonder Woman is directed by Patty Jenkins and is the fourth film in the DC Cinematic Universe. It's not a secret that there was a lot riding on this film. Some people even went as far as to say that if this movie didn't succeed, the future of DC's live action movies may be up in the air. Well, good news; not only is Wonder Woman a great movie, it's one of the best super hero movies I've seen in quite a while.<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>Wonder Woman follows the story of Princess Diana, who lives on the remote (and hidden) island of Themyscira. But one day, a plane penetrates the shield that hides the island from the rest of the world and crashes into the water. Diana rescues the man, and thus it is inevitable that she will visit the world of men (aka London). Also, obviously, she will kick some serious ass.<br/><br/>I gotta say, Wonder Woman's story is one of the most well-rounded super hero stories I've watched in a while. It's intriguing in the beginning, but once the action starts you are locked in for quite a ride. There's emotion, humor, and of course there's a lot of action. I would say that Wonder Woman suffers from the super hero movie syndrome, which is basically where the story follows the origin, conflict, boss fight formula. But we do have to take into account that this is the first Wonder Woman movie, ever. That's pretty crazy when you think about it, and because of that I'm perfectly fine with Wonder Woman following the standard formula. Audiences need to be properly introduced to the character, learn to care for the character, and obviously see her kick some serious ass. It makes sense and it works well.<br/><br/>It's not going to go down as one of the best stories in history, or even of the year, but it's still a fantastic super hero story.<br/><br/>Script<br/><br/>The script for Wonder Woman is fantastic. There are no scenes that drag on longer than they should. The longer conversations have a purpose, and the shorter conversations aren't clunky or awkward. There's also a lot of witty humor throughout which makes the movie much, much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Allan Heinberg did a great job writing this movie.<br/><br/>Characters<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is the focus of this movie, who woulda expected that? So, as you might expect, if she doesn't win over the audience then the movie isn't gonna be all that great. Well, good news: Wonder Woman is great in Wonder Woman. She's likable, intelligent, and surprise, surprise...she can kill lots of dudes.<br/><br/>Steve Trevor is also incredibly likable and pretty funny. He is exactly what he needs to be for this movie, and while he's not the main focus he does help the story along in a big way.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters are secondary/background for the most part (besides the villain which I won't get into). They're all great, though, and help the movie excel to the level it does.<br/><br/>Potential Audience<br/><br/>While I wouldn't take my five year-old kid to see this movie, I would take anyone above the age of 12 to see Wonder Woman. This is a movie that can appeal to everyone. Old men? Yes. Old women? Yes? Middle- aged? You betcha. Millennial? Hell yeah.<br/><br/>If you enjoy a movie that has a good story and a fair bit of action, you'll walk out of the theater satisfied.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is the first major critical success of Warner Brothers' new DC universe, and I hope that it is not the last. It's exactly what we were all hoping it would be. Furthermore, it's exactly what it needed it to be.<br/><br/>Heck, I'll be going to see it again soon, and I'll be buying it on Blu-Ray later this year. It was that good.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, if it isn't obvious already, I definitely think that you should go see this movie. You won't be disappointed."

Learning from Steve about World War I (which they call the war to end all wars), Diana leaves her home in hopes of bringing the conflict to an end. Following DC's previous mediocre superhero films, Wonder Woman is a vast improvement. Not only is the film's action stunning and gorgeous eye candy, but it also has a strong, cohesive plot line that audiences can get invested in. The biggest praise, however, has to go to Gal Godot and Chris Pine for their respective performances. Diana is a hopeful hero, not one to angst or brood like some other superheroes. While she is a more than capable fighter, in this film she is shown to be quite naïve about the workings of the world. This pairs nicely with Steve Trevor, who, while a charming character, is more cynical about the world than Diana. He can also handle himself in a fight and is not in the film simply as someone for Diana to save. In fact, they often help one another out. The film also knows when to slow down from the action and focus on moments between characters, which give the film a more emotional depth. Now, admittedly the film's German antagonists are a tad one-dimensional, being the stereotypical German villains that are evil purely for the sake of being evil. However, this hardly hampers the film's enjoyment. Overall, this is the best film in DC's cinematic line-up so far. It is worthy of the praise and worthy of seeing in cinemas."
"nandidot","9","12","24","3 June 2017"," Glorious Manifestation of Hope and Love
","Patty Jenkins has managed to do what no other filmmaker has done in almost a decade- revive DC. You may painfully recall last year's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The only bright spot in an otherwise excruciating film was the introduction of Gal Gadot's Diana aka Wonder Woman. She walked away with the movie's best scenes set to that killer theme tune. I, like many others, was looking forward to Wonder Woman's solo film and boy does it deliver!<br/><br/>Why did it take so long for a female superhero to get the spotlight in today's era of superhero movies? Because our society isn't quite as evolved as some would have you believe. But no matter. If the long wait results in Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman being made, I say the wait was worth it. Ms. Jenkins skillfully blends action, humor, and heart to create a character that shines brighter than any hero I've seen on celluloid in recent memory. Her star kicks the villain's ass while she lets the patriarchy have it. Hats off, Madam Director.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Diana, an Amazonian Princess, who has been raised on an island far from the rest of the world but when she rescues a pilot from a plane crash she gets to know about the outside world and how men have brought it to its knees with war and destruction. Unable to stand idly by Diana embarks on a destiny defining mission to rescue man from all that is evil. This isn't a short film, as the genre doesn't allow it, but it's well thought out and smartly paced. Action, drama, and humor are all well executed and come up at appropriate times. The visuals and background score are stunning. But more than anything, it's the heart and soul of the main character that keeps you glued to your seat.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot has a sparkling presence. She infuses Diana with kindness and strength in equal doses. Her screams echo in the theatre and the charm in her eyes makes it difficult for you to look away. It's the best cast DC role since Heath Ledger's Joker. Chris Pine delights as Steve Trevor, Diana's companion and guide to the new world. He's genuine and lends a hand (or shoulder) to his costar who doesn't often need it. David Thewlis (who I can only remember as Lupin from Harry Potter) is effective and does well in a relatively short part.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a glorious manifestation of hope, love, and the power of good. While the character is never called 'Wonder Woman', the movie is indeed wonderful. Patty Jenkins has done complete justice to a character that will live in our hearts for a long time. As Diana's mother says, ""be careful in the world of men, Diana. They do not deserve you."" This rings especially true in our troubled times. We don't deserve this hero but we certainly need her.<br/><br/>https://stuffiwatchblog.wordpress.com/2017/06/03/wonder-woman/"

","Well it took them long enough to put her on the big screen but worth the wait (about damn time!) Probably the best DCU movie so far. DC's holy trinity finally up on the big screen, after Superman & Batman hogging the limelight, we finally get to see the Amazonian take the baton from them and show the men how a woman (a wondrous one too) can make proper super hero film,<br/><br/>Grew up watching Lynda Carter making the role her own, so she left some big shoes to fill but Gal Gadot managed to make the role her own but still showing the same humanity and times a touch of vulnerability.<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins has shown what it takes to make a decent comic book movie, looks like the character is in very capable hands and actually managed to put her own stamp on the DCU. To be honest I have the previous DCU films quite lacking in something.<br/><br/>For a comic book film, it actually has a decent story-line, good action scenes but still able to keep the story going in the subdued scenes and had characters you actually cared about, which is more than could be said for the film it followed, Batman v Superman.<br/><br/>Will definitely be a movie I would quite happy to pay to see again without hesitation."

","I just watched the movie and I am very impressed with how it turned out. I was thinking it was a little slow to begin with but still kept me entertained with small action scenes and comedy. There was love in the story, but not in your face with it. Once the action picked up it just pushed the movie into what we would hope to get out of comic book movies. I honestly enjoyed this more than Man of Steel and any other DC movies made between that and now. Dark Knight Trilogy still the best they have."

One of the bad guys is Frau Maru!played by Elena Anaya, With her defected face, caused by an accident, covered up with the appliance on her right side of her face.She acted as good as the James bond female bad character, from Russia with love, Rosa Klep.Another actor, who played the evil Head Hun, Lundendorf, the one who Diana thought was Ares, whom she killed the wrong man, I thought was Maximilian Schell.He wasn't, he was Danny Huston.It Turns out it was Sir Patrick, played by actor David Thewlis only to discovered that you can't force people not to be evil, you have to combat them or eliminate all humans, which Ares wanted.I liked Chris Pines role as the world war 1 spy. The eccentricities his Secretary, played by Lucy Davis, showed she was good with her character.Gal Gadot is an excellent Wonder Women.Then you had the three stooges, played by Said Taghmaoui, Ewen Bremner, and Eugene Brave Rock was wonderful in their characters.The period was very accurate, except in the French village scene you could hear an Edith Piaf record .She might have been a little girl back then in 1917.3d conversion excellent.I heard there was a flat 70mm version too.Well entertaining.09/02/17"

","Here is my spoiler-free review of Wonder Woman. After three films that left most people disappointed or upset ""Wonder Woman"" had a very difficult job to do. It had to please the fans, make people believe in the DCEU again and of course be a good movie. I personally really like ""Man of Steel"" and the director's cut of ""Batman V Superman"" (i am not going to talk about suicide squad) so i was very excited about watching ""Wonder Woman"" and i Think it delivered. It was entertaining at all times, it had exciting action set-pieces but it still took it's time to have some more quite character moments between Chris Pine and Gal Gadot. This is what makes this movie special. It told a great origin story with some themes that were very fitting to the rest of the film. I still have a few issues with the film like the Way some of the characters were treated and the use of CGI explosions but that's about it. ""Wonder Woman is a great summer blockbuster with story, courage and a lot of heart. Absolutely a film that you should watch even If you are not familiar with the comics. 8/10 ⭐️"
"vicmenglu","8","14","29","20 June 2017"," Beach fight is awesome

","(WARNING FOR SPOILERS!!!!)<br/><br/>Simply Amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the Batman Vs Superman movies and had doubts about this one. It didn't start off slow like most DC movies and served as a great back story to Diana ( aka Wonder Woman). Ares served as the perfect Antagonist. I must admit I had his true identity confused. I actually thought Danny Huston's character ( General Ludendorff) might have been Ares due to the glow he had when inhaling the chemical. All in all i gave this a 10/10. It had excellent action and graphics. The dialogue did make me kind of drift off but the plot and the climax made up for it. The only thing i wish they would have added is end credit scenes but hey if you want those you'll have to wait to see The Marvel Universe Movies."

"EthanBJones_03","9","14","29","1 June 2017"," Jenkins has saved the DCEU
","'WONDER WOMAN' was directed by Patty Jenkins and stars Gal Gadot, Chris Pine and David Thewlis. ​After a wounder soldier(Chris Pine) washes up on Amazon shores, Diana(Gal Gadot) believes that Ares is behind it and goes with the soldier into WW1 and tries to stop Ares once and for all.<br/><br/>Let me start of by saying that I am neither a woman nor am I a feminist. I believe all humans should receive equal rights but do not fight for them in any way, so don't call me a femenist. That said, this movie is freaking awesome. People say it empowers women but I think it empowers us as a species. <br/><br/>I've liked every DCEU movie up until this point(yes, even Suicide Squad') but this is the only one that I consider has rivalled Marvel's standard. Gal Gadot gives the best performance of her career as Wonder Woman and commands this movie. Chris Pine plays his role perfectly as Steve Trevor and the chemistry between the two is very convincing and entertaining. <br/><br/>The story is also pretty good and informs the audience all about Wonder Woman, and her past. Both I and the person whom I watched this movie with knew little about the character going in and are both now well educated on the character. <br/><br/>Not to say this movie is without flaws. I will definitely say that the climax of this movie is very messy and could have been controlled a lot better and cleaner. They also try to trick the audience throughout the movie but anyone with a brain can figure out how it's going to go. I won't spoil it for you but I image you'll be able to figure it out.<br/><br/>This is a very good looking movie and the overwhelming majority of the action was handled really well. There is a sequence towards the middle of this movie where I wanted to stand up in the cinema and cheer because it was just that good. The CGI was also very well handled, again with the exception of the climax where it became overused and bloated. <br/><br/>The supporting cast, from Ewen Bremmer's Scottish Charlie to Elena Anaya's creepy Doctor Poison, did a convincing job and served their role to the story. That is to say with the exception of David Thewlis, who started off strong but then became incredibly comical towards the final act. Not to say that being comical is a bad idea but it didn't fit with his character and took me out of the movie.<br/><br/>The majority of the jokes hit for me in this movie and I wouldn't say any of them felt forced or out of place. Don't complain that 'DC's Copying Marvel' because not once did I feel like this was a Marvel movie and was convinced it was DC's own thing throughout the entire run time.<br/><br/>All in all, I definitely recommend you watch this movie. If you're reading this review while the movie is in theatre's, please watch it instead of 'Pirates 5' because this movie needs to do well and will hopefully convince Warner Bros that this is the movie is what the fans want. I very much so enjoyed this movie and will rate it 9 out of 10 Scottish Accents!"

","The new movie, Wonder Woman is very fun to watch but is just like every other superhero movie. The movie is about a girl named Diana. Diana is Wonder Woman.

From other reviews, it shows that adults didn't like the movie. According to RottenTomatoes.com, 89 percent liked it but that also means many adults did like it. It is rated 7.5 out of 10, which seems pretty good. Overall, the facts show that most people liked the movie. This movie is very good but just like every other other superhero movie. It may be easy to find a better movie than this, especially when many other superhero movies are there like Justice League, SpiderMan Homecoming, and The Flash which will come out in 2018.

"DarksIayer","10","17","37","2 June 2017"," Is She With You? - Yes, She Is!
","Full disclosure - I'm a relatively new Wonder Woman fan (thank you BvS!) We kick off with Diana Prince's motif from BvS - nice! That segues into a new DC fanfare! Awesome.<br/><br/><ul><li>My favorite part of the film may be the beginning on Themyscira. The entire island felt so magical, but also real - it very much reminded me of the way Krypton was portrayed in Man of Steel. I hope we get to see more of the island in the future. The beach battle is awesomely epic, and I liked the mythical tale of the war between the Greek gods.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The second part of the film (Diana in London) is probably the weakest. There are a lot of jokes and on retrospect, they are funny, but feel like they were edited in due to the response to BvS. I know that's not true at all, but that's how it came off to me.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The third part of the film is just as good as the first part. Wonder Woman truly emerges here, and the results of the character building and effects in the first two parts lead to an incredible introduction of her to the world. The Wonder Woman theme from BvS kicks in and I dare you not to give a huge grin.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The fourth part is probably the most emotional and philoshophical part of the film. Ares is revealed as David Thewlis after Diana thinks she killed Ares, and he and Diana have an awesomely written scene where Ares pretty much says what historians agree to be fact - there were no good or bad guys in World War I - everyone was at fault, so it was easy for Ares to manipulate people and regain his powers. Steve's death was heartwrenching - Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were on point.</li></ul><br/><br/>One thing I wish they had elaborated on more was the Greek mythology. I want to see more of the gods in the future. I also want more Themyscira. Also, Diana's role in the world following World War I is unclear. Did the public know about her? I'm inclined to think no due to Man of Steel, but I wish they would have explained that more. However, it seems to me to indicate she has been super-heroing on her own ever since Steve's death. I hope Justice League will provide some clarity on that front.<br/><br/>The score was on-point. I don't think I will ever get tired of Wonder Woman's theme.<br/><br/>Just as good as the existing DCEU films. Can't wait for Justice League.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I tried to watch this movie 4 times s the longest I could watch is 20 Minutes...Gal Gadot is NOT Wonder Woman. She is not even a good actress, but the reason I don't like her is her political views.
The main problem with this movie is the storyline. Everyone around me was so into this movie and then I realized it is because they have never read a WW comic book. Nor have seen the animated JL series - which is in my opinion still the best DC show. However Doom Patrol is brilliant.
But back to this piece of ...something. Robin is the only one who actually took her role seriously . Which I am sure was difficult regarding how ridiculous everything in this movie.
I wish they'll recast a new WW and make a better, really good movie about her as her character deserves it. Until then LYNDA IS THE ONLY WW!"

The film was a pretty bad rehash of the first captain American movie with a hint of thor and the new DCEU movie feel which is getting old quickly.<br/><br/>Bad cast bad music rolled into a story that could have worked had the setting not felt so recently familiar and had wonder woman actually come across like a strong badass character instead of scrawny weak looking ""hero"" she was never all that interesting in the comics in all fairness when she started out and only stood out later on for the fact she was barbaric and wasn't against taking the life of a villain if she felt it was the right thing to do even making the justice league turn their backs on her at one point for snapping the neck of maxwell lord.... but this movie was clearly just made to keep feminists happy and it seems to have done the trick but like with the ghostbusters franchise if you are an actual fan of the franchise before the new movie then you will be sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>In short in this movie she is less of a conan the barbarian or red sonja in this movie and more like xena warrior princess, honestly you want a real wonder woman movie just go rewatch red sonja and call it a day, DC haven't saved anything in my eyes yet.

","It was good, but not great. Contains spoilers: I enjoyed watching a head-strong Diana growing up; wanting nothing but to learn how to fight like her role models. However, why she would not be allowed to partake in the warrior culture on an island full of freaking Amazon warriors, who live by the legends of Greek Mythology, did not make sense. I guess it was something about her mother wanting to protect her. Disappointingly, that whole conflict was resolved in like two lines of dialogue between the mother and the Aunt. (A waste of Robin Wright BTW). A lot of the story had plot-holes: why exactly would that sword be difficult for most to wield? It didn't seem like it was, even that secretary-lady waved it around, and what are those bracelets made of and how did she get them?! And what was that German General sniffing?! <br/><br/>The supporting characters introduced later to Diana and Steve's ""team""; I really could not care less about them. The guy who is made out to be a sloppy drunk, but is supposedly the best sniper ever - he never actually does any of that amazing sniping! Why?! It's the first rule of script writing: Do not introduce any elements you don't intend to deliver on! Then there's the flirty guy. His purpose just seemed to be an opportunity for Diana to fight off his advances and brag about how many languages she speaks. It felt like they'd looked at the photo introduced in Dawn of Justice with Wonder Woman surrounded by a bunch of guys and they went ""oh, right, uuhmmmmm! That guy can be the (not) funny drunk and this one can be like.. a smooth-talking ladies' man, yeeaaah!""... Well, they're both stereotypical and non-engaging. However, there is also the Native American guy, I honestly liked his character. It was pretty subtle, but that one line where Diana asks who took his land from him and he points to Steve, that is an interesting step towards Diana understanding that there is no purely evil or good side. I would have liked a follow up on that though. It would have been interesting to see Steve defend a confrontation from Diana on this topic, but I guess they didn't want to dive too much into it. I agree with other reviewers saying the villain was introduced too late. I guess they wanted it to be a suspenseful twist.. But around 40 minutes before the ""big reveal"", my boyfriend leaned in and whispered ""I bet it's that British guy""... Another thing that annoyed me was that there were multiple shots where you could catch a peak at Gadots ahem... Was that REALLY necessary? She is hot enough - We don't need to see her butt cheeks. Yeah Superman's costume is also tight and stuff, but we don't see his cheeks hanging out... One last thing: the CGI sucked! Especially in the beginning on that island. For a movie with a budget like that, it was extremely disappointing. I guess they spent all their money on Hans Zimmer."

","Wonder Woman is a 2017 DC superhero film. The story follows Diana, a young princess of the Amazonian women of Themyscira. Diana grows into a strong and formidable warrior and is eventually introduced to the outside world when a pilot from the Great War crashes near Themyscira. The Amazonian princess saves the man's life and is soon swept up in the conflicts of the outside world.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a fun and action-packed film. The battle scenes are fantastic and there are a few genuinely funny moments. Incredibly moving at times, Wonder Woman is a great superheroine film.<br/><br/>If there are any critiques of the film that could be made, it is probably the few jokes that don't work. They are cringe-inducing, but thankfully, those moments are few and far between. Another point to be made is that most superhero movies, especially origin stories, must always deal with the reactions of normal people to the super- human abilities of the hero. This film glosses over this detail and no one is particularly amazed at Diana's powers. However, these are minor critiques.<br/><br/>Overall, Wonder Woman is a great film. Nearly all audiences will find something to enjoy in this movie. Fans of the comic books are especially in for a treat. While no extreme changes are made from the newer source material, fans will be very happy to see their favorite heroine done well in a good movie."

","Okay so I must admit.... I was really excited to see the movie.... but got BOOOORED during most of it (especially the first 30 minutes or so). It did not raise to my expectations and it was actually pretty terrible. I mean seriously? First of all it was too SLOW. It took forever to get on with the plot, it felt like an eternity till she ACTUALLY started doing SOMETHING. It was very scattered, she (her character) didn't evolve at all, the plot was terrible and totally predictable, I mean I was watching with my dad and I was saying out loud ,,she'll do this"" and it's exactly what happened. It felt like she was just a naive girl with superpowers. When I watched the other superhero movies like Spiderman, Iron man, Captain America and many others, it was inspiring... they had something to fight for an, and they evolved trough the movie, they discovered themselves. This movie was full of crap. they could have made this movie into something incredible, something inspiring that would blow us away, but they Blew IT, BIG TIME. Just WASTED 2 hours of my life."
"WondrousMoose","6","13","27","18 July 2017"," This movie is okay; this woman is amazing.
","Wonder Woman is the fourth movie in the DC Extended Universe and its second film following a single hero. Given the quality of the movies that preceded it and Wonder Woman's anemic presence in last year's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, I really didn't have high hopes for this one. I figured I'd give it a shot, though, and to my surprise, it wasn't awful; in fact, I mostly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Diana (Gal Gadot) is an Amazon from the island of Themyscira, a land occupied and governed entirely by women. When American fighter pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash-lands off their coast, Diana rescues him and leaves her home to try to put an end to the First World War, which she believes to be the work of Ares, the god of war. Matters aren't as simple as she planned, though, and she ends up learning uncomfortable truths about humanity, as well as secrets of her own identity.<br/><br/>For the most part, Wonder Woman is a relief from the dour, clunky DC films that have preceded it. First off – this one is in color! Gone are the days of gray-and-orange sludge; this movie has green grass and a blue sky. More importantly, Wonder Woman's costume has taken on some classic red and blue. The requisite sexist and fish-out-of- water scenes are mostly given their appropriate time on screen without becoming tedious, and a good deal of the intended humor actually lands. There's an improvised scene early on featuring the two leads on a boat at sea, and they play off of each other wonderfully.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film still suffers from a lot of the issues that the previous DC films have: awkward pacing, on-the-nose dialog, weak villains, and an overwhelming score that beats you over the head with what you're supposed to feel at every step of the way. The movie is also incredibly cheesy, and while there is an appropriate, or even desired amount of cheese in a comic book movie, I found myself groaning a bit too much from it all. The battle scenes also manage to out- Snyder Zack Snyder in terms of their overuse of slow motion and ""awesome"", impractical fighting. When Wonder Woman herself isn't involved in scenes, I tend to lose interest, and the reveal toward the end of the film hit me like a handful of Triscuits.<br/><br/>Far and away the best aspect of the movie is Wonder Woman herself. Gal Gadot's performance as a naive hero with an overpowering sense of duty is impeccable, and I loved watching her work. This character saves people because she wants to save them, and it is truly compelling to watch such a pure expression of a superhero. We have seen enough movies about heroes begrudgingly doing their work; in BvS, Superman looks pained to help, and Batman doesn't even try to save anyone.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman in this film just might be my favorite superhero in the current cinematic universes, across both Marvel's and DC's movies. We see a hero who fights for those who can't fight for themselves. Marvel has produced quippy dialog and some fun fight scenes, but its heroism has faltered lately. For their deity superhero, they gave us a pile of cardboard with a hammer and a sexy accent. I haven't been this excited for comic book movies since the first Avengers film, and I really wasn't expecting that from DC at this point.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie, not for its intrinsic qualities as a film but for the direction it is potentially taking the DCEU and for its main character. I still don't have high hopes for Justice League, but if they keep this hero doing what she does best, I'll probably be just fine with it."
"gradyharp","8","11","22","22 September 2017"," 'I will fight for those who cannot fight for themselves.'
","Director Patty Jenkins knows how to make us appreciate that once tired cliché of Wonder Woman and in her new feminist viewpoint this Wonder Woman is indeed a wonder. The screenplay of the DC Comics perennial favorite comic book heroine was written sensitively by Allan Heinberg based on the story by Zach Snyder, Allen Heinberg and Jason Fuchs who remodeled Dr. William Moulton Marston's original creation from 1941! <br/><br/>One of the reasons this version works so well is sharing the origins of Wonder Woman so well: her beginnings as a child ('sculpted from clay by Zeus) being raised by Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and Antiope (Robin Wright), and finally flying off to defeat the god of war Ares (whatever happened to Mars?). Gorgeous scenery and terrific special effects offer a springboard to the story that follows.<br/><br/>When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, Diana (Gal Gadot), an Amazonian warrior in training, leaves home to fight a war, discovering her full powers and true destiny. Before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained to be an unconquerable warrior. Raised on a sheltered island paradise, when an American pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes on their shores and tells of a massive conflict raging in the outside world, Diana leaves her home, convinced she can stop the threat. Fighting alongside man in a war to end all wars, Diana will discover her full powersand her true destiny. In the setting of WW I in Germany the bad guys are Ludendorff (Danny Huston), Sir Patrick (David Thewlis), and Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya), and Diana's allies are Steve (Chris Pine), Sameer (Said Taghmaoui), Charlie (Ewen Bremner). The supporting cast is excellent also.<br/><br/>For once the CGI effects enhance rather than distract (until the final confrontation between Diana and Ares), the musical score (Rupert Greson-Williams) fits the film, and the photography (Michael Jensen) is rather splendid. There is enough pungent anti-war philosophy to make the film sail. This is bound to be followed by a series of more adventures: the public loves DC Comics – and in this case the praise is worthy."

","I, first, cannot begin to imagine why so many negative reviews are out there for this film. I am, usually, a total Marvel fan. However, this movie has started to change my mind in the wake of the other awful films DC has tried. I think they could not have picked a better person and actress to portray this role than Gal Gadot. She can be such a positive role model. The fight scenes are incredible and so are her moves. I disagree, also, that there was no character development shown in the movie. What about the whole beginning of the movie on the island, showing her as a girl growing into a great Amazon warrior? One slight downside was the portrayal of the villain. He was a bit underwhelming, in my opinion."
"tomrito","9","11","22","5 June 2017"," Wonderful movie
","Don't usually write reviews any more but I had to because of some of the really bad things people are saying about this movie. This happens to be a very good flick regardless of it being a DC. Comic book movie. Hard to understand why a movie with humor, good acting, good charter development, good original story and good action sequences can get some people so upset. I think it is not the movie but the people themselves. This movie is very good entertainment for all ages and anyone who disagrees, really doesn't know what they are talking about. But like they say opinions are like butt holes, everyone has one."
"shihanyu","9","11","22","5 June 2017"," Beautiful, inspirational, and the first female dominant superhero film in over a decade
","As a comic-book movie, Wonder Woman undoubtedly ranks near the top. It is by far the best DC installment thus far; which isn't saying much, but I would also say that it compares competitively with the recent Marvel installments.<br/><br/>Director Patty Jenkins' film stretches over 141 minutes, and unlike most superhero story lines, Wonder Woman never really extends unnecessarily past what was appropriate.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot's performance is astonishing and powerful in this film as she was able to show the emotions of love, sorrow, motivation, innocence, and sincerity beautifully and bravely. As the first female dominant superhero film in over a decade, Gadot delivers an inspirational message to her audience about the strength of women.<br/><br/>The humor was thoroughly enjoyable and never forced. The film found a great balance between humor, action, and drama while depicting a hero's journey and delivering a story full of purpose.<br/><br/>Director of Photography Matthew Jensen shot impressive action sequences along with dramatic scenes to pull together a well-rounded and well-shot story. Also Jenkins' color schemes throughout the film, especially Wonder Woman's color of blue, gold, and orange, make the scenes more emotional and alluring — that along with the beautiful music score.<br/><br/>A couple critical opinions: First, I was hoping for more depth in Chris Pine's character (Captain Trevor). As Diana slowly became assimilated into modern culture and behaviors, it would have been more fulfilling to see human emotions, like real jealousy and frustration, through Pine, instead of constant bewilderedness and humorous anxiety. Additionally, I think the film failed to grasp the concept of warfare's harsh and incomprehensible realities, even though there were several opportunities to do so.<br/><br/>Second, as beautiful was the fight choreography and photography, the action sequences could have cut down on the Slo-Mo, and instead could have let the action run normally to depict the enjoyable confusion and speed of melee combat. The editing was impressive and cool, just a little over the top.<br/><br/>Overall, Wonder Woman was a beautiful film, one that I think is necessary for today's society. I hope this film further carries the motion for more strong and inspirational female leads."

","After watching it yesterday, I must say that this movie is one of the best movies I watched! I might even say the best movie that is based on a comic book. Until now Marvel was crushing DC based movies, but Wonder Woman movie gives DC a chance to level it up. Movie has a great balance between action scenes, storytelling, humor etc. A lot of blockbusters give you more or less stuff that you see in trailers and you already know what you will get. But in this movie there was not a part that was boring, and when the movie was over there was nothing missing to show or tell. Great! I would recommend it to you even if you are not a fan of comic book based movies. I would give it a 10/10 if one of the actors did not play Stryker in X-men, casting should avoid crossovers with Marvel and DC universe in my opinion."
"cuatro33","Null","18","40","7 June 2017"," Obvious politically target-oriented film than a really entertaining film
","OK, this movie wasn't bad at all, but isn't good either. It's a poor attempt from those who own the rights of DC Comics' characters to start a new franchise such as The Avengers... which comes 6 years later. This movie is comparable to Captain America: The First Avenger, but most of the people is no longer interested in movies about the origins of superheros because... well, we all know them.<br/><br/>The acting is below the average, and the CGI is, despite its quality, too unrealistic. OK, we're talking about the daughter of the King of the Gods, but the way the movie manages her obvious overpower above her peers is so bland it makes you laugh rather than enjoying the film. The story isn't even good, all situations coming out from nowhere just to fake some kind of continuity along the flick.<br/><br/>I can't understand some of the extremely positive reviews of this film, but I guess it has something to do with the new Hollywood trend to make films about women empowerment, and it's getting good reviews because it's the first blockbuster to show a woman as a non-mystical super-heroine in the main character since Lara Croft. Maybe they should ask the creators of the last Mad Max movie for some advice about making a movie which truly represents the real postulates of the feminist movement, instead of filming ridiculous action films with zero undertones just for the sake of the box office based on DC hardcore fans and out-of-criteria feminists."

I was expecting it to be below par compared to most Marvel movies, as I generally prefer Marvel to DC. However, I think this film lives up to the high standards that Marvel have set over the years and hopefully DC will continue to produce movies of this standard in the future.<br/><br/>Perhaps the poor reviews were written by people who are either biased in favour of Marvel or no longer enjoy the superhero genre.

","After the lackluster efforts that were ""Man of Steel"", ""Batman v. Superman"", and ""Suicide Squad"", I just about lost hope in the DC Extended Universe. When I saw this film, however, my faith in this franchise was restored. This was an excellent movie that gave the franchise the kick that it needed.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot was a wonderful choice for the role of Wonder Woman, and she pretty much nails the role. She looks the part, is convincing in the action scenes, and puts the right amount of emotion into the role. She also did a good job of selling that she is a character who has a lot to learn about the outside world.<br/><br/>Steve Trevor is a nice supporting leading character, and is played well with Chris Pine. His chemistry with Gal Gadot was surprisingly good.<br/><br/>One refreshing thing about this film is the color palette. After three films of nothing but bleak and gray, we finally get some bright colors to liven things up. There was also some wonderful cinematography.<br/><br/>The story and character development are much stronger than expected and give the film a considerable amount of substance. The action scenes are thrilling and do a great job of establishing Wonder Woman a tough-as-nails hero.<br/><br/>One complaint about the film is that Danny Huston isn't that great of a villain. He's not terrible, just rather forgettable. The film was also a bit overlong and had just a few too many slow-motion shots. The CGI effects also weren't the best.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very happy with how this movie turned out. After how she was shoehorned in ""Batman v. Superman"", it was great that they finally did the character of Wonder Woman justice. One of the better superhero movies in recent memory and definitely recommended.<br/><br/>RATING: A-"

But after watching it, I can see why it's out there already. <br/><br/>I got a chuckle out of other reviews that keep talking about fighting Nazis...never mind that this movie was set in WW I, so no Nazis, people, sorry. Yeah, there were problems with the plot, and the acting could have been better, but my biggest problem with the film was the lack of character development and the historical inaccuracies. The vehicles (motorcycle especially) and aircraft, clothing, speech, everything - wouldn't even have passed muster for a WW II film, let alone one set in WW I.<br/><br/>From the previews I had high hopes for this movie, and I really liked Gal Gadot as WW, but the movie overall was just 'meh'. I watched it and actually made it through to the end (unlike a few other reviewers) but I did find myself glancing at my watch more often than usual.<br/><br/>So yeah, there have been better superhero movies, but there have sure been worse ones, too. I'd say this one is worth a watch if you can get past the somewhat flat acting and directing. But definitely not one to go out of you way to see."

"MaccyXpert","8","5","8","23 November 2017"," Finally something good out of the DCEU (thanks to a lack of Zack Snyder)
","I think the story was fair, given that it fit Diana's naive nature (and it was about WW1, which you rarely see in films nowadays). I think the design of Themyscira was nice, not overdoing it, yet keeping true to their medieval nature (they fight on horseback with bows, swords, shields, armour and live in stone houses, so yeah). I was a bit confused when Hippolyta just let her go with Steve to the outside world (I just thought, ""You're not even gonna try? Really?""). I liked the fight sequences, where she purely seems angry (honestly) and goes through as many German soldiers (maybe a tad overdone) as she can. <br/><br/>I have no qualms or complaints about the casting of Gadot. I also think that her and Nielsen being foreign (not from Britain, the US, Australia, etc.) was good - they didn't just make it boring, but they went a more exotic route that paid off (also, reading off the Wikipedia page, apparently Nicole Kidman was negotiating for the role - I definitely think Nielsen did a better job than Kidman could have). I also think that Pine, in the scene where he's being interrogated with the Lasso of Truth on Themyscira, talking to the Amazons and later Diana, handles it in an unbelievably calm fashion, so props to him for that. I'm also glad that Steve didn't just trash Diana's naivety whenever it came into play. <br/><br/>I am very glad that there was actual humour in this damn movie - the rest of the DCEU didn't really have much at all. Chris Pine's existence and Diana's lack of knowledge about, ""man's world,"" worked well together (along with supporting characters, like Steve's crew) to create those moments that brought a more lighthearted tone to the movie than the rest of the DCEU (which we needed). <br/><br/>I think maybe they could've explored the emotional depth a bit more, given that part of the movie is about her realising the darkness of humans (that Steve repeatedly reinforces throughout the film). They also probably should've added the people (whom she and the others save) being confused and amazed rather than only thankful (because seeing someone with THAT kind of armour in 1918 would've baffled most). <br/><br/>I think at certain points, she got melodramatic, emphasising grief and other negative emotions too much. Rotten Tomatoes describes her performance as, ""charismatic,"" which I'm not honestly too sure about. I also thought that some of the dialogue relating to the drama could've been better."

Gal Gadot is Super beautiful.. but that's it.. <br/><br/>I saw her first in Batman vs Superman and I was horrified by Ben Affleck's Batman and then I was thankfully introduced to Henry Cavill's Superman (had dodged ""Man of Steel"" because Christopher Reeve was Superman for me), and there I felt his Superman really radiating from the silver screen, and then there was WonderWoman's first appearance there, OK for that movie, but for her own movie ""Wonder Woman"", I expected something more than pretty Super looks and grunting.. I haven't seen Gadot in any other movie, but as Wonder Woman goes, it was meeh.<br/><br/>And the story line was as 'great' as ""The Emoji movie"". <br/><br/>3 stars because of the wonderful Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen.

Is Wonder Woman going to be the first DCEU film to be overwhelmingly praised? Yeah, I think it will!<br/><br/>Wonder Woman stars Fast and the Furious actress Gal Gadot as Diana, the princess of Themiscara, which is a mysterious island of amazons hidden from the outside world. The action starts when Chris Pine's Steve Trevor meets Diana when he crashes his plane near Themiscara and recruits her to help him with the escalating World War.<br/><br/>I went into this movie with a lot of reluctance because I love these DC characters and Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and even in some ways Man of Steel disappointed in different ways. I wanted this movie to be the first great DCEU movie and I'm really happy to say that it is!<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins directs with grace and wonder. You can tell how much she loves the character of Wonder Woman. Patty Jenkins had said that one of her favorite films growing up was Superman: the Movie from 1978 and you can really tell because there are a few homages to that movie. Wonder Woman is a strong character and this film makes movies like Catwoman and Elektra look like a complete joke. If you mix together the fish-out-of-water element of Thor and place it into the World War setting of Captain America: The First Avenger, then you get a good idea of what this movie is.<br/><br/>Much like Chris Hemsworth in the first Thor and Dave Bautista in Guardians of the Galaxy, Gal Gadot is limited in the amount of dramatic acting she has to do and is instead given the chance to show her surprisingly decent comedic chops to hide her unseasoned acting ability. The beauty comes from when Gadot really needs to get serious in some key scenes, she brings it and she's pretty commendable. Add on her great physicality and look and Gadot is actually pretty damn good in the role!<br/><br/>Her Chemistry with Chris Pine is one of the highlights of the movie and may be one of the reasons Gadot is as good as she is. There are several scenes where his performance is just laugh out loud funny. In particular, a scene with both Pine and Gadot on a boat had me howling for more.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, while I wouldn't say that Wonder Woman is one of the best comic book movies ever made by any stretch of the imagination. I would, however, say that it is a very good installment and that it is the best DC movie since 2008's The Dark Knight!<br/><br/>4/5"

All this is not say that it wasn't an enjoyable film because it was. Credit to the writers who wrote a multi dimensional character for WW who develops during the course of the film. And credit to Gal who played it perfectly as a young woman with a bit of nativity at first but who then slowly discovers her power, her purpose, and herself along the way. Gal's performance is both adorable and bad ass and I couldn't take my eyes off of her for a second. The action scenes were well done. The back drops and sets are wonderful.

","Woman lead superhero movies have had a tough outing so far at the box office in recent times. The Wonder Woman character when introduced in the Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice was received with an encouraging response. But, there were speculations over whether a standalone film on the character would really work. But Wonder Woman soared at the Box office, broke many jinxes and also has received a great response from critics. Patty Jenkins has done 'wonders' directing her first major motion picture.<br/><br/>The movie tells us the origin story of Diana, princess of the Amazon race, where she and other Amazonians are away from the contact of the outside world. When Diana rescues the pilot Steve Trevor, who crashes his plane into their island Themyscira, she comes to learn about the World War I in a hard way. Trying to find her purpose, Diana leaves the island with Steve against her mother's will to end the World War I. Steve teams up with Diana to prevent Germans from using a mass destructive chemical weapon created by an evil scientist. The rest of the movie is about how Diana, Steve and their small team stops the German army general Erich Ludendorff, from using the mass destruction weapon. During this journey, Diana learns more about the humans, finds love and discovers her true identity.<br/><br/>Although a Superhero movie, the film also dwells into other human elements which make the movie special. Kudos to the stunt team for some brilliant action sequences, especially involving the character Diana. The chemistry between Steve and Diana almost makes you feel like this is one of the best love stories ever told. The movie also makes sure not to fall short of humor which has been a very key element in the recent superhero movies. The background music and the slow-mo shots are bound to give Goosebumps to the audience. <br/><br/>Gal Gadot has landed the role of her life in this movie. Wonder Woman suits her style, personality and also her beautiful face. Her dedication and hard work in preparing for the character reflects really well in the action sequences. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor is very adorable and is very sure leaves the audience wanting for more. Although Robin Wright doesn't have much screen time, she has a very powerful role. Other big names like Connie Nielsen, Danny Huston and David Thewlis do justice to their parts. But this movie is totally dominated by the lead characters Diana and Steve. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman has to be the DC's best work yet after The Dark Knight trilogy. It is a very well told origin story of a superhero and is filled with emotions. Overall, this movie is not just a celebration of woman power, but it is the celebration of humanity. Wonder Woman makes you smile, it makes you cry and overall gives you a very satisfying movie experience."

","In the movie, Wonder Woman saves the world. In real life, Wonder Woman breathes new life into the DC Extended Universe. Marvel has been formulaic but successful when it comes to creating their movie universe, while the Warner Bros/DC approach so far has been flawed, risky and divisive. Director Patty Jenkins though sets everything right with one of the most nuanced superhero origin movies ever made.<br/><br/>The plot though stays close to the comics, only trading one war of another. The year is 1918, the war that was meant to end all wars is still on with millions of casualties on both sides. The Amazons are in Themiscyra, hidden from the rest of the world. Diana is the daughter of Zeus, and is just beginning to realize her powers when Steve Trevor, British spy comes knocking into Themiscyra, with a bunch of Germans behind him. After a brief skirmish, the Amazonians come to know of the ongoing confrontation, and the intention of certain people to prolong it. Diana guesses that the God of War Ares is manipulating the war and decides to eliminate him. The rest of the movie is about Diana's understanding that humanity consists of both good and bad and this is what makes them unique, and in the process herself transform from a powerful Amazonian, to a god.<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins keeps it simple- a wry script, fast pace, rocking background score, great fight sequences and terrific visuals are key her ingredients. Couple that with her ability to extract excellent performances from the entire star-cast, and no wonder you have a billion $ movie coming right up.<br/><br/>As compared to Zack Snyder's gritty dark takes, Wonder Woman is a mood uplifting movie. By the time it ends, you truly believe that there is hope left in this world. And that itself is Diana Prince's true superpower. Go on and enjoy a movie that will truly brighten up your day. 10/10"

","Great sound mixing, spectacular fight scenes, PHENOMENAL CHEMISTRY BETWEEN GAL GADOT AND CHRIS PINE, impressive origin story, superb special effects, AMAZING director. Wonder Woman is the film DC needed to bounce back, and they did it perfectly. The movie was not scared of doing other superhero movies were doing. Patty Jenkins did an awesome job on directing this movie and she deserves huge appraisals because of it. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine has a phenomenal chemistry between them and I hope to see them work together again on future films because it is one of the strong points in this film. The supporting character are charming, and are amusing to have around. The film was funny on the right scenes. I really like this movie a lot. And unlike the other DCEU movies, Wonder Woman had a lot of colors and it made me like it more. The flow of the movie was good too, it never had any boring aspect to it. Man, this movie really made me excited for the other upcoming DCEU movies. I'm now looking forward to Justice League and I have high hopes for it AND I hope they will not disappoint me. Wonder Woman deserves all the appraisal it received and I highly recommend every one to watch this movie."
"haidanglifecoach","9","14","30","1 June 2017"," Best superhero movie by far this year
","I had the opportunity to watch WW early and I had to say that I was deeply satisfied with the movie. It blew my expectations. Gal Gadot is made for this role. She is stunning, beautiful yet has the aura of a great warrior. Chris portrays Steve Trevor well and has nice chemistry with Gal. Actions are done wonderfully and you can feel some of the elements of Zack Snyder in the movie. There are many heroic and epic scenes in the film that will definitely be remembered for the year to come. Music is done beautifully as well. DC always has a knack for producing great music and this one is not an exception. If you want a movie with heart, some humor, great action this will definitely be the movie for you to watch this June."

","The whole movie and story line just didn't come together for me. The wannabe feminist cliché monologues (which had nothing to do with feminism itself), no character development all in all and jumping in time were simply uninteresting to follow. The movie itself provided nothing new or pleasantly surprising. I felt like the humor was kinda forced, I had several face palm moments. It's a pity that WW came out so shallow.

","Yes, I really wanted to like this film but I knew better after the first THREE terdfests from the DCEU.<br/><br/>Apparently, I'm a glutton for punishment. Don't be like me, you shouldn't see this awful movie and certainly it's not good to support such trash. The more money the DCEU generates the more we'll see the same mistakes over and over and over again.<br/><br/>Despite the fake early reviews, it is safe to say that Wonder Woman is another miss from Warner Brothers. The movie feels overcrowded and bloated yet shallow as a mud puddle. Comics have the beauty of telling a story over months of issues where corrections can be made even when the ball is rolling. Films do not afford that opportunity. If you make a mistake — like casting a beauty queen that can't act — then you're stuck with it. You can't ""change artists.""<br/><br/>Word on the street is that Warner Brothers ordered the DCEU to incorporate humor and less morbid story lines. Well, the film that was turned in did feel like a piecemeal script. Apparently, you can't even hold out hope for a directors cut this time around.<br/><br/>This script must have been written by the people who write the responses ball players give at a press conference. Seriously, did the writers make a drinking game out of how many awful one-liners they could jam into the movie? It's like they opened fortune cookie after fortune cookie looking for the next cheesiest line. Did the director have any input on writing any of this mess? <br/><br/>At the end of the day, there is only one cure for the affliction the WB keeps perpetrating and the bad films that we find ourselves plagued with right now — STOP! <br/><br/>Just stop going to these movies! The studios will never stop churning out this mindless drivel that sucks all hope out of seeing a good superhero movie again until we stop throwing our money at them.<br/><br/>Trust me, the dumpster fires that were Suicide Squad and BvS may be worse but in and of itself Wonder Woman just isn't worth your time or money."

She meets a man named Steve and he tells her about the problems being causes in the real world. She leaves the Amazons and goes and fights through the war. What I noticed about the movie because of the time period was the special effects and the technology. The special effects were really good, so was the acting. There is nothing that made me question the historical accuracy of the film. There are no connections I made with any other movies with this one. I thought it was unique and told a different story. Three things I liked were the actors. I like the overall story. I also liked the special effects. One thing I didnt like was Steve Trevor dying. I thought the movie was good.

","Yes it is yet another super hero movie. At the beginning (spider man, iron man) I liked the genre cause it was something different. No more spy themes, fighting the cold war, which is already long over in reality. Then it quickly started to bore me and recently I even got annoyed. Hulk, episode 20, Iron Man episode 30, Spider Man third character....
But this had some appeal to me. There is some sort of a story. There are characters and there is some OK acting. The action slowly builds up from some initial Amazon training scenes to later total god mode out of this world in the air hovering boss fight. 
If you want a movie to be successful these days you have to do this stuff. Either do it or be removed from the theaters after one week. After all: it is entertainment business.
What I really enjoyed is the artwork. There is a stunning image language and breath taking beautiful sites. And I do value this. 
So maybe don't focus so much on the action and enjoy the tastefully arranged scenery."
"chickenjackson","9","3","4","28 December 2017"," Why Wonder Woman is so wonderful:
","Every once in awhile a superhero film comes along that communicates something worth thinking about on human nature. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is such a film. <br/><br/>Finally, a dc universe film has come along helmed by a masterful director (who just so happens to be a woman ;). Wonder woman is a refreshing take on a classic character that has one foot in mythology and one foot firmly planted in the human condition (tellingly, in the world's first world-wide war). It is an impressive feat that somehow this movie manages to be a creation story, a loss of innocence story, a period piece, a war of the sexes, a hero's journey, a commentary on war, and a commentary on human nature. <br/><br/>What leaves me most in wonder though is how the film is able to pull off a sort of anti-superhero commentary on the superhero genre itself; in which the protagonist is simultaneously literally god-like in power but also powerless in the context of man's inhumanity to man. <br/><br/>Wonder woman is a character whose values are out of time like Captain America and whose powers are out of this world like Superman, but she is also unlike either of them. She is a woman. It is in this space that her story and motive takes flight. <br/><br/>Most superhero stories are almost completely centered on the protagonist or team of superpowered protagonists to defeat the clear antagonist. It took Wonder Woman to make me realize what superhero stories are too often missing: context. Specifically, social context. Diana is amazingly powerful but in the film she's never really a lone ranger hero. When she is in Themyscira she is surrounded by a sisterhood of Amazonians. When she is the ""real world"" she is surrounded by the brotherhood of a rag-tag team. The people around her teach her, influence her, and ultimately motivate her. Some may see this as a weakness but I believe this is the strength of Wonder Woman's story. She gains the humility and moral courage to recognize it is not just about her. In fact, more so than any other superhero film I can recall, Wonder Woman has the bravery to admit as well as to capture the gravity of the challenge before her (and really all of us)...that it is not so much about the villains outside of us but rather about the evil that is within all of us. (SPOILER ALERT) So why is humanity worth saving then (this is the very temptation Jesus wrestled with in the garden)? A repeated line in the film states: ""it is not about deserving...it is about believing."" We are not all good. We are broken. We are all in need of a power greater than ourselves. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is not just about truth, justice, and the American way, but she recognizes that at the core is the hardest work of all...loving the other."

"Lejink","8","3","4","8 December 2017"," Stevie's Wonder
","Well, this DC comicdom blockbuster wasn't what I expected at all. Although I am a DC fan, I'd never read the Wonder Woman comics themselves although she was a member of the Justice League Of America comics which I did read avidly as a boy.<br/><br/>There was an entertaining introductory prologue where we see the young Amazon Princess Diana learning her skills as well as gaining the independence she needs to later strike out on her own as she joins forces on the front line of World War One with Steve Rogers, an American soldier working undercover for British Intelligence, whose path initially crosses with hers when he accidentally leads the pursuing Germans to Paradise Island while escaping with top secret information vital to the war effort.<br/><br/>I thought the idea of transposing the action to 1918 a clever and effective one as it reduces the need for over-the-top ""God On God"" SFX pyrotechnics and in a neat twist, centred the action on the day before Armistice Day, making Diana's Mission all the more important and urgent.<br/><br/>Of course, being a super heroine, Wonder Woman, of necessity, requires a super-villain to push against, and after being sidetracked by another competing red herring, a suitably all- powerful foe in the person of fellow God Ares, played by David Thewlis, emerges in time for a climactic battle at the end. Thewlis however is better in his part before he reveals himself and has to be kitted out in his Greek toga to provide a seemingly unlikely foil against our girl.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot, highly praised in the title part, is indeed excellent in her role, whether playing the day-saving heroine or the innocent abroad character trying to settle into wartime London. Athletic and attractive she holds the movie together well. Chris Pine supports her ably as the down-to-earth hero Rogers.<br/><br/>I did feel the kitchen-sink climax between Wonder Woman and Ares undid a lot of the good work that had gone before as it too garishly contrasted with the WW1 realism striven for elsewhere.<br/><br/>One of DC's better recent movie entries, the story did however seem to write itself into a number of dead ends by the end from which it will be interesting to see how the writers move things on. However, in the comic universe, as we've seen many times before, all things are possible and I look forward to seeing this character return in future adventures."

"kk-carrie","8","3","4","18 November 2017"," A better DC movie
","Let's start with the good bits:<br/><br/>Gal is amazing throughout the movie especially in expressing her confusion,anger, appreciation (to the ice-cream, yass Gal), and sadness. The reason I mention this is due to the comparison with her partner, Chris Pine's performance which I will mention later. Besides the charming actress, the movie managed to deliver the ""cool"" factors that are expected by the audience with all the martial arts choreography, the firing guns, the bombing and the destruction gave the kicking impacts that I wanted. I certainly did not see it coming when Ares' identity was revealed. The plot twist got me impressed because the absence of supernatural being in large part of the earlier scenes ,besides Diana, got me questioned the existence of Ares.The ending of the movie was not perfect but nice, as Diana acknowledged her inability to stop mankind from making destructive decisions but addressed that she will do her best to contribute to the world peace because she believes in love is the solution to mankind's war. <br/><br/>The bad cookies:<br/><br/>Chris Pine is cute and that's it. He's sub-par performance as Gal's partner did not help Gal's effort in creating the chemistry between the two characters. His problem is that he seems to carry the same expression or tone throughout the entire movie, and it looks worse when juxtaposed with Diana. The romance between them therefore seems forced. I only teared up when Steve died because of Diana's grievance plus the flashback. Ugh the flashback, Steve's confession sounds unnecessary and insincere, wasting all the build-up scenes of sparks between them. The big bad guy was funny. I get it that the intention is to show Ares is the deceptive villain who hid in plain sight and prey on the weak humans, but it will be better if Ares is shown as a faceless form to create the powerful mystical impression than taking on Patrick's face. I couldn't stop laughing and even cheering for Patrick to fight. The background musics are very DC-like, nothing impressive but not bad either."

Her sword is not like the comic, and is a waste the Gods are all dead and the feared ""super weapon"" makes no sense, as it seems to pretty weak, both of the heroes breath it in just fine, even ""normal"" gas in WW1 was worse, only difference seems that gasmasks break, for some reason. They say they made mustard gas with Hydrogen, which should do nothing to gasmaskes, and differently not break glas. Most chemical weapons react on skin too, so there really is no reason to break the mask at the WW1 level of tech, and differently not if the target is London, which again would not make the English surrender in the war as most of the troops are already at the front at this time. The bomber that has to deliver the weapons are actually more of a ""super weapon"", in this point of time anyway.<br/><br/>All in all it feels like they have watch Captain America, added a little more sex, took out the humor, switch the weapon with gas and bad guy with a God, that is stronger than all the Gods combined, but weak against lightning from Wonder Women that he himself just trowed....."
"zero-to-HERO","9","12","25","4 June 2017"," Easily The Best DCEU Film To Date! Simply ""Wondrous""!
","As someone who's followed Wonder Woman since Lynda Carter graced the role of the iconic Character in the 1970's to the current modern rendition via the comic books, Wonder Woman has always captivated my curiosity. However it wasn't all that easy for this character to become the iconic figure she is today. Sexism (at least in regards to Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman), has come a long way. And after years of overcoming such hurdles - here we are, the unthinkable became a reality and Wonder Woman has finally arrived in her own major motion picture.<br/><br/>Although I was quite delighted that there was finally going to be a Wonder Woman on the big screen, I will admit I was quite skeptical at first of Gal Gadot playing the part (absolutely and 100% nothing personal), and I laid open that if I were wrong about this conclusion that I would admit I was erroneous via my skepticism. A part of me thought 'if this rarity of Wonder Woman on the big screen gets screwed up, it won't be given another chance in a very long time'. I now understand why they went for a slightly more slender look - there was a fair bit of backlash with that decision due to the fact that when most people think Wonder Woman, the first thing that comes to mind is her immeasurable strength, but many of us forget how immensely swift and agile she can be. Thus this is why Gal Gadot's appearance and/or how she was portrayed complimented the best of both worlds, and is why it really seemed to have worked in this film. That been said my congratulations to Gal Gadot, Patty Jenkins and Zack Snyder. The film was absolutely extraordinary, and my uncertainties can finally be put to rest. As for Chris Pine playing the role of Steve Trevor. Hey it's Chris Pine were talking about... of course he pulled off the part splendidly! The rest of the cast was meritable and they complimented one another quite fittingly.<br/><br/>Finale Verdict: What made this picture work was how everything seemed to have flowed in near perfect harmony, from screen writing and production, to cast and crew - the end result was nothing short of spectacular. What intrigued me most was they took classic Wonder Woman Lore, and still managed to fuse modernized mythos into the story. The beauty about this Superhero film in particular is whether you're a Wonder Woman comic reader or not, this motion picture delivers for both readers and non readers alike. Although I had a couple minor qualms, they were so minuscule that they aren't even worth mentioning. Not only is Wonder Woman an inspiration to women and girls around the world, but men and boys alike. So go out and see this 'Wonder' on the big screen, you won't regret it!"

","This is one of the best movies of the year so far. The plot is interesting and the casting was great. Chris Pine was perfectly cast and Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright were both very good as the main Amazons. Danny Huston and Elena Anaya were terrific bad guys and David Thewlis is always great. And a special shout out to Lucy Davis who is marvelous providing some comic relief. But of course this is ultimately Gal Gadot's film and she was an impressive Wonder Woman. She's very tall and gorgeous of course so you knew that physically she would fit the bill well, but she really delivered in all of the scenes including the lighter moments. There is a lot of action including some really good scenes with the Amazons in the beginning of the film. The special effects were good, but not great (I did see the 3D version). I really loved the island of the Amazons set and would love to find a place like that to retire to. Even the vintage clothing in the film looked good.

The ending is a bit all over the place but you wind up being forgiving because the movie until that point was done very well. I hope DC learns from that. I rated it a 9 because I couldn't do 8.5 Stars. I could've done 8 but cut DC a break for what seems to be learning from past mistakes|missteps. I would've given it a 10 if the ending wasn't all over the place. I'm also taking into consideration that this is the introduction of Wonder Woman. I'm sure Lynda Carter is proud. As the Wonder Woman introduction into the Modern Super Hero | Heroine Universe this will not disappoint at all. Looking forward to better things from DC and really hope they learn from any mistakes they make. I'm more of a Marvel guy - but I Absolutely Love Wonder Woman. I also root for amazing Comic Book Movies no matter who they are from."
"Screen_Blitz","9","12","25","2 June 2017"," Exhilarating superhero spectacle from start to finish, Wonder Woman is an entertaining hit
","After suffering from two cinematic misfires 'Batman Vs. Superman' and 'Suicide Squad', the DC cinematic universe has managed to find light at the end of the tunnel with this exhilarating superhero action spectacle Wonder Woman. Needless to say, the hype for this one is high. Introduced in the aforementioned Batman Vs. Superman and set to appear in the upcoming DC hype 'Justice League', the eponymous superhero is treated with a stunning cinematic experiment that brings more than just eye-popping visual heft and a pulse- pounding narrative. It firmly embraces the dazzling nature of the titular hero from the comic books without leaving out room for some political themes and a surprising emotional heft many entries of the widely popular genre neglect. This is all brought beautifully together by director Patty Jenkins, first female director behind a superhero flick in history. Furthermore, it marks the first female-centric superhero flick since the horribly panned 'Elektra' twelve years ago. This film follows Diane (played by Gal Gabot), a young lady born and raised by her mother Queen Hippolyta (played by Connie Nielson) on an island entirely inhabited of women. Upon saving Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine), a British pilot who crash lands into the ocean, Diane grows eager to help fight as a warrior in the European front during World War I. Against her mother's wishes, Diane sets out with Steve to Europe the defeat the God of War Ares who they believe the cause behind this tragic war -- all while becoming the famous Wonder Woman in the process.<br/><br/>Whereas 'Captain America: The First Avenger' set its titular hero in the era of World War II, this one sets its hero in the height of World War I, the war that many referred to as ""the war to end all wars"". With the Great War serving as the backdrop of the plot, this open doors to some surprisingly clever themes surrounding the titular character and the atmosphere. As with many superhero movies, this one kicks off with an origin story showcasing Diane's upbringing in a world dominated by women, and her inspiration of becoming a warrior following her encounter with Steve Trevor followed by her family's harrowing attack by the German Army. The premise along the long journey that follows is greatly strewn together by themes of women empowerment, a political issue that ran rampant during the World War I era. Without overarching the story, the political themes and the story's ideology about mankind being the catalyst of war nicely fuel the versatility of the plot, especially when the hero and Steve Trevor come to the epiphany towards the end. Furthermore, the chemistry between Gal Gabot's Wonder Woman and Chris Pine's Steve Trevor is genuine and, unlike many action flick, never drags into ham-fisted territory. Both of their performances are swell, particularly Gabot who boasts great versatility in the lead role. And the humor, which pokes fun at the feminist themes throughout the picture, is surprisingly clever, if occasionally awkward. Like in many superhero entities, the action sequences which consists of a prolonged fight sequence on a rugged German battlefield, a fight sequence on a beach, and the final climatic battle at the end are all visually impressive and exhilarating to watch. The final fight sequence in particular sets stone to unexpected emotional resonance, while splashing the screen with abundance of colorful CGI -- more better or worse. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a spectacular superhero action thrill ride from beginning to end, and represents nearly everything that makes a superhero movie entertaining. It is a film that defies against the disappointment of the DC cinematic universe's previous entries and marks a game changer for the DC comics' cinematic cosmos. It is not a perfect picture, but it is certainly one that is more than worth seeing."
"dee.reid","8","12","25","2 June 2017"," A ""Wonderful"" ""Wonder Woman""
","To say that 2017's ""Wonder Woman"" is the best DC Comics film I've seen since probably ""The Dark Knight"" in 2008 is indicative, I think, of how far DC Comics has lagged behind Marvel Comics in terms of bringing their superheroes to the big screen. But DC Comics did have one ace up its sleeve, in that Wonder Woman, the first widely recognizable super-heroine in the history of comic books, would ALSO have the potential to be the first super-heroine to launch her own truly successful movie franchise. (The first female superhero franchise would have been the ""Daredevil"" spin-off ""Elektra"" in 2005, but that film failed to launch such a movie franchise.)<br/><br/>To that end, DC Comics has largely succeeded with ""Wonder Woman,"" a film that breaks with past DC movie titles in the fact that it's headlined by a female lead and - most important for this viewer (and, borrowing the words of another commenter) - it has a finer balance of action and levity, and the latter seems to arise naturally from the material and doesn't feel forced. Marvel has succeeded in that regard to make their films more entertaining - even if every other line in one of their films now ends in a punchline.<br/><br/>But, I digress.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman, who was created by American psychologist William Moulton Marston (the man responsible for creating the polygraph machine) and inspired by his wife Elizabeth and their mutual live-in lover Olive Byrne - and who first appeared in ""All Star Comics #8"" - is a character I have an unusual relationship with.<br/><br/>I'm 31, going on 32. And I'm a guy. Growing up, I had always heard about Wonder Woman, but did not actually become a fan of the character until about five years ago, and that was by way of the Lynda Carter TV series ""Wonder Woman"" from the 1970s. I still believe Carter to be the ultimate Wonder Woman - in spite of that show's inherent '70s cheesiness - but this big-screen 2017 film adaptation may prove that that version of the character has been formally relegated to the rapidly changed times. Wonder Woman was also not the first female superhero I encountered growing up - I believe it was Storm of the X-Men, from Marvel - but she was still the most widely recognized character that I was aware of growing up. Watching the Lynda Carter TV series, I thought it was amazing to see such a positive central portrayal of a female superhero that I hadn't seen yet in television or film.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" is a film that I had high expectations for, and those expectations were largely met. ""Wonder Woman"" isn't your typical origin story, either - being that this version of the character first appeared in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016) last year. The film also doesn't waste a lot of time obsessing over every little detail, and waste precious screen-time, of how young Diana (Lilly Aspell), an Amazonian princess, eventually grows up into the beautiful Diana Prince (Israeli model and actress Gal Gadot). She already is Wonder Woman; she just has to learn to be the person that she was destined to be and realize her purpose in this world as a super-heroine.<br/><br/>When American U.S. Army intelligence operative Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash-lands his World War I plane in the waters just off Diana's beautiful island of Themyscira, he enlists her to return to Man's World to help him deliver a stolen notebook containing valuable information on a new chemical super-weapon that the Germans are developing (mustard gas). Along with Diana, Steve recruits three friends - secret agent Sameer (Said Taghmaoui), Scottish sharpshooter Charlie (Ewen Bremner, Spud from ""Trainspotting,"" who also serves as this film's comic relief), and the Native-American expatriate The Chief (Eugene Brave Rock) - to help them accomplish their mission and stop the war-mongering German commandant General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) from going forth with his plans to launch a mustard gas attack on nearby London.<br/><br/>Directed by Patty Jenkins, ""Wonder Woman"" has the distinction of being only the SECOND superhero film with a woman at the helm - after German director Lexi Alexander (""Punisher: War Zone"" in 2008). It would seem appropriate, I suppose, that such a groundbreaking character could only be done proper cinematic justice by a female director, and Patty Jenkins is quite the competent one here. Gal Gadot, who like all able-bodied Israeli citizens, served two years in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), and I would hazard a guess that her military background certainly helped in getting her the part to play Wonder Woman. She's a tough and formidable presence on the screen and plays the character remarkably well (she definitely IS this version of Wonder Woman) - but again, I still favor Lynda Carter as the DEFINITIVE Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>If ""Wonder Woman"" suffers from any problems, it's in the action sequences. As someone else here pointed out, ""Wonder Woman"" suffers from the same slow-motion, gravity-defying CGI effects first pioneered by ""The Matrix"" (1999) and was way, WAY overdone in its two sequels. I honestly felt like I was watching ""The Matrix Reloaded"" (2003) and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" (2003) all over again, and I thought that Hollywood had grown out of its ""Matrix"" obsession years ago - and yet it seems like it's coming back. You could find an excuse in the fact that it's a comic book superhero film - but still, it's very jarring and can tend to slow action scenes down. Yeah, it looks cool and all, but sometimes it can be overdone and hamper your overall enjoyment of the picture in these places.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" was a solidly entertaining, if imperfect, big-screen debut solo outing for such a groundbreaking character and comic book property. Now, I honestly can't wait to see a sequel where Wonder Woman is saving the world in modern times.<br/><br/>A ""Wonderful"" ""Wonder Woman,"" indeed.<br/><br/>8/10"
"CynicAce","9","12","25","1 June 2017"," the best DCEU movie
","finally!!! the very first good DCEU movie, Gal Gadot is perfect as Wonder Woman, Chris Pine is also perfect as Steve Trevor,their chemistry is amazing, the casting were great, CGI was amazing, Story is good, there are some scenes were the story slow down but it was good because you have that time to know more about the characters, there's a lot of action moments, there are some tiny ones and the major ones, the finale get a little bit CGI heavy but its expected, and i didn't mind it, the villain character for me is a little bit weak, and the scores were amazing and the movie was colorful, its not as dark as the previous DC movies, overall the movie was amazing, its finally a win for DC"
"mitsubishizero","9","4","6","31 August 2019"," One of DC's greatest movies!
","I thought this was a really great movie! Most people seem to like it though there're some that hate it for some reason. The story's pretty simple: Diana Prince AKA Wonder Woman wants to help people in WW1 thinking it's that simple. As the story progresses it becomes more and more complicated. The characters are interesting. Diana (Gal Gadot) is the typical do-gooder with a strong sense of justice, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) is more than a love interest. He can hold his own when the situation arises. The villains are threatening but they're also a little over the top. When it's revealed who the real villain is I thought the twist was well pulled off.<br/><br/>The action's awesome, the scene where Wonder Woman fights her way through the trench was cool and the final battle between her and Ares was emotional. It starts off hopeless but in the end Wonder Woman comes out triumphant. I also think the dialogue is well written. It covered issues that we still deal with today such as sexism and morality. I highly recommend this to anyone whether you're a fan or not. Swing in and experience the action."
"bader-habeeb","7","4","6","13 August 2019"," It's better than the others!

"MaxGMason","9","4","6","24 March 2019"," A honest Superhero Origin
","The best of the DC Universe in my opinion, the beginning is perfect, the humor is so good because it is not forced it came with the situation and the character I love how Diana sees and understands the world is a vision so innocent but so energetic, powerful that is contagious and makes you love the character, has so many moments of characters retrospection so well developed. It is not afraid to be cheesy so it came out as honest, for me it is the problem I have with superhero movies they want to get away from the good, selfless, noble hero because they are aparently 'cheesy' so superheros movies for me don't seem honest but parodies or so dark that they are depressing. This is what I want to see in a superhero movie, the scene of no man's land made me feel in a way that I have no words to define it... it was EPIC.<br/><br/>But I think it's a shame that the end has broken the rhythm, I think Dr Maru is one of the most mysterious and interesting villains whose potential is wasted to make way for a plot twist and another of the final CGI battles that DC abuses. The movie had a very clear message that at the end i don't know why they decides to destroy it making the story a bit inconsistent for me."

"emmreeder","9","4","6","16 January 2019"," Wonder Woman is One for the History Books
","Superhero movies are so prevalent today that it can often be difficult to see the differences when the similarities between the movies are so prominent. A childhood trauma or adversity overcome with determination and a little luck. Extravagant movies that differ in location and character but share many of the same qualities. Of course, superhero movies tend to have the most vocal and supportive fans across the movie genres, perhaps due to their feel good messages of good conquering over evil. While message is true in movies like Black Panther and Wonder Woman, their unique stories provide the audiences with a fresh take on the ever popular superhero movies.
The film kicks off in France at the Louvre, where Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, receives a package from Bruce Wayne. In the package, a picture and a note saying ""I found the original. Maybe someday you'll tell me your story."" The majority of the movie is a flashback, first transporting the viewers to the magical and exquisite island of Themyscira and focusing on Diana's childhood. When Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) stumbles upon the island, bringing German soldiers with him, the Amazons have their first encounter with the modern world. Steve and Diana set off to Europe with both hoping to end the war. Although the Wonder Woman comics are originally set during World War II, Director Patty Jenkins opted to change the time period to World War I, or the ""war to end all wars"" as it is referred to in the movie.
Gal Gadot masterfully creates the earnest and naive Diana, a refreshing twist from the usual angsty superhero movies, which exist both in Marvel and DC comics. Her belief that by defeating Ares, all of mankind will stop fighting shows the best. Her complete and perhaps unearned belief that mankind is inherently good, only serves to add to her naivety. Steve spends either in awe of Diana and incredulous. Chris Pine adds more passion and heart to the movie with his portrayal of Steve.
This is not to say that Wonder Woman is flawless, with a run time of around 2 hours and 30 min, it is rather long, not that most fans would have any objection to this. Jenkins also opts to include the overdone final fight scene at the end of the movie, however she does a nice job helping the audience to feel the emotions that the characters feel.
Danny Hurston, playing Ludendorff, the evil German general, along with Elena Anaya as the mad chemist intent of creating the largest weapon of death ever seen, are the main villains that both Chris and Diana are intent on stopping. Diana believes that Ludendorff is Ares, the Greek god of war, while Chris clearly doesn't believe the same. The two enlist a misfit band consisting of the ""Chief"" (Eugene Brave Rock), a black market smuggler, Charlie (Ewen Bremner) a struggling marksman, and Sameer (Said Taghmaoui) an undercover operative.
Director Patty Jenkins does a wonderful job of mixing humor in with the depressing aspects of war. One scene that does a great job of adding humor is when Steve's secretary Etta (Lucy Davis) takes Diana shopping for clothes, as her Greek clothes do not blend in well in London. Diana's insistence on the ridiculousness of the fashion trends, as well as her trying to properly move in the clothes does a nice job of adding humor to the film.
The costume designer, Lindy Hemming, did a wonderful job of creating costumes that convey the magical feel of Themyscira, and changing Wonder Woman's original costume with high heels to one more practical for fighting.
Overall, Wonder Woman does a fabulous job smashing the mold of a typical superhero movie, filled with angst and the overdone trope of overcoming a difficult event. Any flaws that exist do not detract from the viewers enjoyment. Jenkins does a masterful job of adding emotions and a realistic view of human behavior and life. This movie is refreshingly different, while still maintaining the aspects that make a superhero movie great. Wonder Woman is a must watch movie for the most avid superhero fans, as well as those who have never seen one."

","I watched this movie for my history through film class, and it was a really fun movie to watch after watching all the boring, educational movies. I like the way that it portrayed Wonder Woman as someone who didn't really have an idea what the war was really about. She was really innocent, and didn't want people to die who didn't deserve it. She was searching for Aries, and nobody believed her and just thought she was crazy, until the end when they found him and she used her own power to destroy him, because she was the God Killer, not the sword she was carrying around."
"Holt344","10","4","6","9 December 2018"," Wonder Woman, a true Hero and almost a masterpiece of a movie
","This is now my third time watching this superb movie and it's still as great as the first time, I didn't even know about the character before watching Batman vs Superman and now it's one of my favorite superheroes.<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins as the director was a good choice, she made the character true to her comic counterpart and she gave her heart into the movie that paid out immensely. The cast is filled with great actors and the women is portraying powerful and great characters which is for some reason groundbreaking, I'm glad it has been done. Gal Gadot, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, Chris Pine and Danny Huston all makes great and believable performances.
The music, cinematography, choreography, production and art design and costumes are a few things that made this movie into a masterpiece. It truly feels like you are in their world, the immersion is real.
The movie is great and doesn't stop being great until the final battle, something is missing there. Other than that it's a masterpiece for the Superhero genre. I can't wait for the sequel!"
"kaycibay","8","4","6","9 December 2018"," Wonder Woman Worth the Watch
","In this movie, the two main characters are Diana and Steve, who are played by Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. You go through a journey with Diana, who ends up being the superhero, Wonder Woman. Steve, a war pilot who crashes into the Amazons land, Themyscira, only to go and meet Diana. They the go on an adventure with her to find the god of war and defeat him. Themyscira is the land of just Amazonian's, and they have never seen a man before. This leads Diana and Chris to learn more things about each other, and the ""relationship"" they have.
The theme to Wonder Woman, in my thematic idea, is that Diana is finding what her purpose is and how the world works. Another movie that shares a similar theme would be another superhero movie like Thor. I say this because when Thor comes to Earth, he was expecting humans to be different than what he thought they were. As you go through the film, Diana
knows exactly what her mission is. She is constantly talking and looking for Ares the God of War, and she is fearless when it comes to defeating him. It puzzles other characters in the movie when Diana is wanting to be in the war and acting like a warrior , mainly because she is a woman and she does not fit the social norm of the time period they are in. Since the theme was her figuring out how the Earth really works, Diana finds out that mankind is more trouble than she had thought. She does not understand why men start wars and why the politicians are too cowardly to fight with their men in the field. Wonder Woman uses lighting the most when it comes to getting the theme and the feeling of the scene across. In the movie, you can see how bright and beautiful Themyscira was. Then cut to the Earth, to see a dark and gloomy setting. Since there's a war going on, the film shows the scenes of a country that's been ravaged and affect by it. The characters have a scene where they walk through the trenches and there you can see how the filmmakers used color. While Diana is in the trenches it is very gloomy but when she comes out to cross the enemy lines the lighting looks almost inspirational. This is a huge point in the plot, because Diana is seeing who the enemies are and seeing that the God of War is not someone she can fight. When Diana climbed out of the trenches, the setting showed a different light. It shows Diana hitting all the bullets away, and the lighting shows a hero. The lighting was the best way to display the overall feel of the time period.
Another technique that Wonder Woman used was angles. I like to say that the angle was a huge part of the movie mainly because of an intense scene, which was Diana running across enemy lines. The filmmakers really utilize the angles in this scene mainly because the angle is different when you see Diana running to the enemies. Different angles were used in a variety of scenes throughout this film. Another example of this is from the beginning of the movie, there was many scenes of the women warriors. They were fighting on horses and jumping from them, the angles of the camera really impacts the emotion of these fight scenes. Wonder Woman was full of excitement with emotion, and certainly worth the watch!"

","So let's start with saying that this is the best DCEU movie bar none and there is good fun to be had here...........but I have many gripes with this film and please hear me out before rating how helpful this review is.<br/><br/>Pro's:
1) Gal Gadot completely proved me wrong. She is great as Wonder Woman and completely fits the part.<br/><br/>2) Gal Gadot and Chris Pine have great chemistry and once again Pine is impossible to dislike.<br/><br/>3) The action scenes-particularly the house scene on the battlefield-are outstandingly done and very well-choreographed.<br/><br/>4) Diana's backstory was risky in that if it was done poorly it would make her feel completely out of place among the other Justice League members. Luckily, they did a good job and it does the character justice.<br/><br/>5) That last fight was REALLY fun to watch.<br/><br/>Con's:
1) It's........dull. Especially with such a vibrant opening origin for Diana, why on earth would the writers shift gears and place the story in the bleak and colorless setting of WW1? It's just boring.<br/><br/>2) The side characters and secondary villain are so pitifully forgettable it's almost painful.<br/><br/>3) Oh my god the villain reveal. Remus Lupin is supposed to be Ares? Stop. And right after Diana was coming to understand that Ares was less of a person and more of a concept. Absolutely squandered a moment of growth for the character and connection for the audience. And for the love of god, whose idea was that handlebar mustache?<br/><br/>4) Absolutely zero romantic connection was needed between Diana and Trevor. Having them kiss toward the end really took away from the independence and power that eminates from the character of Wonder Woman otherwise. Very poor choice.<br/><br/>
All this being said, it's good fun. I'd give it a B-/C+."

"deepak-zeest","9","10","20","2 June 2017"," A good watch for the weekend complemented by amazing visuals
","Set in the backdrop of the World War 1, and an overtly dramatic interpretation of imperial Germany, the movie does a fine job of projecting Wonder Woman into the DC franchise.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot with her god-like beauty fits so well into this god-like character, it seems almost unimaginable for someone else to be in that role. Her portrayal of Wonder Woman is exactly what one expected from the character, and she delivers it with so much style, elegance and beauty, it is almost enigmatic.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty straightforward and does a good job of making Wonder Woman shine with all her brevity, ignorance, quirks and dilemmas. <br/><br/>Chris Pine, as usual is full of life with his role, and his character complements the plot magnificently with great enthusiasm and hope. <br/><br/>Special effects were brilliant, especially the perfectly timed slow- motion slices in the middle of fight sequences. Music is a bit distracting sometimes, but the Wonder Woman theme pumps up the energy levels. <br/><br/>Nothing extraordinary has been set up in the movie for the upcoming Justice League team-up, and the movie stands by itself just fine. As an introductory movie of a major character from the franchise, it does a pretty fine job, as it focuses on the back-story of the character rather than jump right into the bandwagon of the 'team of superheroes'.<br/><br/>Loved this movie and the shade of social message it tries to impart along with it. <br/><br/>Good movie, average movie, bad movie, I was anyway going to watch it for Gal Gadot. God she is awesome. Even a single glance of her makes a man's heart skip a beat. Can't stress more on the fact that I love her. The embodiment of the character she plays on screen - A Wonder Woman indeed. <3 <3 <br/><br/>First female director for a comic book movie, and that too for the epitome of female comic book characters - Patty Jenkins makes this movie special and path breaking. Salutes to her.<br/><br/>Verdict : A good watch for the weekend complemented by amazing visuals. 3.5/5"
"subxerogravity","9","10","20","2 June 2017"," Getting DCEU out from under!!
","Yes! it's about time. As far as I'm concern the tribunal over at DC is Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. So why did it take sooo long for this movie to finally get made when the other two have been rebooted three times over? <br/><br/>It's the best movie in the DC Extended Universe too, but that's not saying much, cause it's really not that hard to beat Man of Steel, Batman v Superman or Suicide Squad.<br/><br/>It reminds me so much of Captain America: The first Avenger, even though they change Princess Diana's point of origin from World War II to World War I, but same premise, The Great War forces the Amazons who have not been a part of Man's world for centuries to get evolved and that came in the form of Princess Diana.<br/><br/>The best part of the film is the relationship between Gal Gadot and Christ Pine who plays Steve Trevor, the most important man in Wonder Woman's life since the beginning. Diana coming to Man's world with this bright eyed innocence of right and wrong, and Trevor's awkwardness of trying to explain how man's world works made for some fun scenes as well as some great drama. Done so right, it really makes up the heart of the movie.<br/><br/>The action scenes were pretty good. Sometimes a little too much CGI when trying to visual explain what Wonder Woman's power structure is, but I really like what they were doing when she worked that magic lasso (Other than getting the truth from men). It was really cool.<br/><br/>The villains were good. Better than a lot of villains in these comic book movies, not better than Micheal Shannon as General Zod, but I really liked Dr. Poison and what they did with Aries.<br/><br/>I will say that there were points, like during the final battle that maybe it got too corny with the dialog about the hero's journey and the villain's evil speech.<br/><br/>But overall Wonder Woman is showing a step in the right direction for DC's film franchise, far more true to the character out of the comic than I've seen them do in this extended universe, and Gal Gadot almost became my favorite Wonder Woman (I'm sorry you can't beat Linda Carter in those satin tights but she only wins by a hair).<br/><br/>Check it out.<br/><br/>http://cinemagardens.com"
"Lewis_Heather787","8","10","20","2 June 2017"," The DC cinematic universe has been saved and is back on track....... at last!!!
","I personally thought Man of Steel was a great film, however audiences and critics were divided. Batman v Superman I thought was good but had some major falls with story and structure, the critics and fans again were divided on the film. Suicide squad also had similar problems to BVS and once again divided fans and critics. Up until this point the DC cinematic/extended universe had not had a film that majority of critics and/or fans liked. Wonder Woman, the latest instalment in the franchise however I think has cracked the code............at last!!!!!<br/><br/>After being burned like many fans after the, lets say rocky, 2016 Warner Bros and DC had with BVS and Suicide Squad, expectations for Wonder Woman weren't exactly high. This however may have been an advantage for the film, even saying that this film has managed to carefully balance the dark and comedic, just about. <br/><br/>Patty Jenkins has delivered big time on this film with a story and character that has multiple layers, on multiple backdrops. This film exceeded my personal expectations by far, the action in this film is probably better than BVS and Suicide squad put together. A surprising and fantastic use of slow motion that really caught be of guard and is perfectly used, works very well in the heavy CGI scenes. Jenkins achieves an extremely hard thing and that is to balance all the brutal and large scale action with some brilliant personally character scenes, achieved in part by her very unique camera work throughout the film. Great work!<br/><br/>Now when Gal Gadot was cast a Wonder Woman, years ago, I was on of those people on the bandwagon saying that she was not good enough for the role. Up until that point her acting career had not being ideal and she was lacking experience, I personally believed that a more experience and well known actress should have been chosen for the role. How wrong am I now, Gal Gadot has completely changed my mind and is brilliant in a role that requires a lot from the actor. She is brilliantly funny, charming, naive when needed but then can change into this army killing machine at the flick of a switch, Gadot adapted very well. The rest of the cast is also at the top there game Chris Pine yet again improving every film he appears in, as well as Robin Wright, Danny Huston, Connie Nielsen and David Thewlis all giving good performances. <br/><br/>As sort of mentioned already the action and CGI in this film is brilliant, uses the ground work action from the previous films in the DC universe and puts it on steroids. Even though at times it is a bit of a CGI mash up, how else were they going to do it, so I can empathise which the creators in that respect. Fantastic production design and cinematography complement each other so well in this film, every frame is either beautifully colourful or dark and disgusting, at the perfect times. <br/><br/>Now the negatives of the film and yes there are some this film is very far from being perfect but its a vast improvement from the other DCEU films. One thing that DC has to its advantage over its rivals....""Marvel""...cough......is their villains are much more menacing, complex and interesting. However this film takes the ""Marvel"" approach and makes the villain completely underused which is very disappointing to see especially as the villain in the film is Ares the god of war. Instead of the god of war they should have called him the side kick of war, extremely disappointing, especially considering his fight with Diana goes on for a tiny portion of time. The next negative of the film is humour in the film to an extent, now I know I said this is a positive of the film, I also believe it is a negative as well. Some of the humour and jokes in the film payed off and some of them didn't, that is fine. However its the underlining feeling that these humorous scenes or instances were very forced , a bit like Marvel dare I say it. Which unfortunately is the way that DC are now having to go after BVS, which I personally had nothing wrong with the darkness and lack of humour in the film.<br/><br/>All in all this film personally is the second best in the franchise just behind Man of steel for me, however can understand why this could be the best for some people. This film has far less problems than any of the others in the DCEU, Wonder Woman is 8 out of 10 or 80% and is a really enjoyable great watch, with great action, very good character development , brilliant directing. Makes me very interested in Justice League later in the year and a possible Wonder Woman sequel. It is well worth your time!"

"CANpatbuck3664","9","15","33","7 June 2017"," Wonder Woman Brings a Great Hero Into the Spotlight and Its Anchored by Good Central Performances and a Unique Setting
","*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We join Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) at the Louvre. She tells us a little about her past and her mixed views on mankind. She's working at her desk when representatives from Wayne Enterprises come into her office. They come offering gifts however and Diana accepts the briefcase they give her. Inside is the original photograph of her and her compatriots: Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), Sameer (Said Tagmhaoui), Charlie (Ewen Brenner) and The Chief (Eugene Brave Rock). They fought together in war-torn Belgium during the First World War. With the photo comes a note from Bruce saying that someday Diana has to tell Bruce her story. The photo is precious to Diana and she begins to fill us in on what happened to her so long ago.<br/><br/>When I was watching Batman v Superman and the same photo appeared with Diana in that World War 1 setting, my first thought was ""I want to see that movie instead."" Part of that was the WW1 setting and I'm so glad they chose to set Wonder Woman in this time period. It provides a unique backdrop and there were so many interesting moments like Wonder Woman's fight across No Man's Land. WW1 is rarely covered in Hollywood and they make connections to real WW1 issues like the introduction of gas attacks into warfare. I thought it was impressive that they capitalized on such a strong concept, I have to credit the writers and director Patty Jenkins for doing such an excellent job.<br/><br/>It wasn't that long ago that Warner Bros. and DC were hearing tons of complaints about Gal Gadot being cast as Wonder Woman. Admittedly, she's not known for being a serious actress but I really think she did an impressive job. She's strong yet vulnerable and she completely holds up her end as Diana from both dramatic and action oriented standpoints. They made a good call casting somebody of Pine's calibre beside her. He has a cool character to work with but he also balances his character's responsibilities as a spy and a guide to Diana for this new world she's experiencing. Danny Huston and Elena Anaya are both good but they're undercut by their characters in the end. I really liked the other members of Diana's crew even if they're not as central to the plot as they make them seen. I especially thought Said did a good job, he helps sell some of the nuanced emotional moments. Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen are also really good, the stuff with Diana's past could have been hokey but they handle it so well that it actually works.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman includes everything you want in the superhero genre. The action is well shot, it's not necessarily anything mind-blowing but there are a few nice set pieces. It joins Deadpool and Captain America: The First Avenger in being one of the few superhero movies where they have a romantic subplot that actually sells. There are also some funny moments, most of them at Diana's expense of not knowing what the world was like in the 1910s. Lucy Davis is largely there as comedic relief as Etta and she does a decent job helping keep things light.<br/><br/>For all the glowing reviews Wonder Woman, its not perfect. They do a great job setting up the villains and they even throw a curve ball at the end. But I didn't think they were very memorable and you're not going to remember Wonder Woman for their characters. They also gouge a few of the background villains pretty badly to lend some credibility to the main villain which wasn't my favourite choice. The ending wasn't poorly done but it devolves into the same fight we've seen in a dozen other superhero movies. I get we need a big finish but the rest of the movie deserved a better finale.<br/><br/>I've been a little more forgiving of some of DCs franchises so far (I thought Man of Steel and Suicide Squad had their redeeming parts) but this is easily DCs best movie since Christopher Nolan was in control of Batman. They take advantage of an underused setting, Wonder Woman is a great protagonist and the cast (specifically Gal Gadot and Chris Pine) deliver strong performances. The movie isn't flawless however and I think the hype train has gotten a little out of control. It actually falls victim to some pretty typical minor issues for the genre. We should celebrate the fact that DC gave us a well-made and satisfying origin for Wonder Woman, if you have a chance to go see it, I would recommend it."

","I find a lot of reviews self-important to the point of sickening so rarely write one... However! This movie totally surpassed the ""gorgeous amazon kicks ass"" flick it could have merely been. There are many Adrenalin rushes and plenty of swooning to be done over lovely Gal Gadot but also there's wry humour, an actual story, a fantastic job by Chris Pine and, at it's heart, a poetic romantic ideal that brought a lump to the throat without a trace of cheesiness. My new favourite DC/Marvel movie. I didn't expect that at all. Fantastic."
"joshualawrencepike","6","16","36","8 June 2017"," Not bad, but held back by its source material
","First of all, Wonder Women was a fun movie, something that I was very glad to see DC do. The plot is fast moving and engaging. They do a good job of developing the secondary characters that Steve (the main character) brings, given the run time. <br/><br/>Some of the problems come from the source material, those you can't really blame on the movie because their hands were tied. There were two problems however that were not inherited. Firstly even when they have hours or days no one really explains what WW1 is about to Dianna, she never really understands that its more complicated then two groups of angry people fighting in the middle of a field. She is just dragged around by those who do really understand what is going on and then reacts to that. She never really takes charge or attempts to understand what is going on. Secondly you only really see the real villain so late in the movie that much of the drama is missing. Far from all, but you do lose much of the satisfaction that you had in movies such as Avengers, where you saw the villain straight away.<br/><br/>Problems with Wonder Women Franchise (also spoilers ahead) These are problems that are from the comic book source. I thought it best to separate them because you can't blame the movie for making them. Also they bug me more more then most people so take them as you will.<br/><br/>-Dianna is so powerful that normal humans serve no purpose in a fight with her as allies, they can only get in the way. The best way to win a battle would be the send her in alone and let her do her thing. At most, normal people would act as spotters. After all, would you follow after her? Even brave men would need a reason to risk their lives. When you can't help her, but may slow her down why would you even try?<br/><br/>-The amazons call themselves warriors, but all they really do is practice with antique weapons. They have not fought anything more then a duel since the dawn of mankind. For them to call themselves warriors is like an 80 year old man calling himself a football player because he once played a pickup game at age 10. At a minimum, they would need to keep up with with modern weapons and strategies. Not to mention that you normally need more then a few dozen people to win a war. <br/><br/>-Speaking of winning the war, the only reason amazons exist is to fight the enemy that Dianna left to fight. I just don't get it, why not go with her? <br/><br/>-If your purpose of existence is to fight an enemy who is known to be a puppet master, how can you expect to fight when you seclude yourself on an island that he can't find? What was their plan? It looked a whole lot like their plan was just to wait forever and hide, knowing that even if the battle they were training for comes they would not know it, and if they knew about it would lack the numbers and the weapons to fight it. They come off as cowards who fear nothing more then fighting the battle they are training to fight. They fear it so much they do everything they can to not know its coming.<br/><br/>www.JoshuaLawrencePike.com"

","I am a huge fan of the Marvel Movies, but quite frankly DC has left me kind of tepid or Luke warm on their past movies in the super hero realm. I went to see ""Wonder Woman"" with mediocre expectations and got totally blown away. For me growing up with Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman on TV it was going to take some doing for me to get that blown away feeling. Well I got a nuke dropped on me, because DC finally lives up to all the hype it got on this one. Gal Gadot is the new ""Wonder Woman"" and leaves all the rest from the past in her dust. She is simply amazing along with the story, the characters, villains, and visual effects. Even along the way I heard chuckle's and laughter as little one liners and good humor was sprinkled in. The movie had that all along with a little romance and deep feelings thrown in. Even the side kicks for Steve Trevor were colorful and well done. I really enjoyed ""The Chief"" played by Eugene Brave Rock, he made a comment to Wonder Woman in the movie about the war, and what it was destroying and said his people were destroyed by Steve Trevor meaning the white man a long time ago. Lots of thought went into the script dialogue and this is DC's crowning jewel for Wonder Woman and women in general. Wonder Woman isn't just the princess anymore as now she is the reigning Queen of the DC superhero flicks!!"

Full of emotions, ups and downs, some silly jokes in between some comments given by the actors, and incredible effects make it the first and the best DC movie I think's the best!

"XweAponX","10","13","28","11 August 2017"," Gal Godot tells us about that picture in ""Dawn of Justice"".
","I loved the first impression of Diana Prince from Dawn of Justice. She had the look and the attitude, stood up to Bruce Wayne, and had the general appearance of competency. I've seen this actress in other films and this is who she is.<br/><br/>But in this film, we see there was a time this was not so, she was not even allowed to train with the rest of the Amazon Women. Even after she did become the best of the Amazons, she was still kind of goofy. I enjoyed that stark contrast from the woman in Dawn of Justice.<br/><br/>Of course, it took Chris Pine, who was still channeling his own goofy version of Kirk, to help define the Princess of the Amazons.<br/><br/>And their interaction was what got me interested in this story. Imagine a World War I Soldier stumbling into an invisible island, full of Gorgeous Women who kill off an entire Nazi regiment? They have no idea what the world is about, and they send their Princess, actually Diana is more than just a princess as we learn later- They send this Princess out into a world she knows nothing about, so there is a short time where we see Diana continuously breaking protocol for women allowed in the early 20th Century. It was an opportunity for various Faux Pas, and well played. Also, she redeems herself nicely.<br/><br/>But she sets herself an agenda based on the wrong impression of who the Bad Guy actually is. She has determined, without knowledge, that it must be a German General. Because she has no concept of deceit or trickery, this original ""virgin"" Wonder Woman has never been exposed to that, and it's a problem that Pine's character ""Steve Trevor"" teaches her how to deal with.<br/><br/>Lynda Carter's version of Wonder Woman was enjoyable in a campy sort of way, but that version of WW never dealt with an important facet of the character: Her Immortality. And, in the Justice League comic books, there are only two immortals that are constantly in the center of things: Superman and Wonder Woman. I refer everyone to the wonderful Alex Ross illustrated ""Kingdom Come"", which better defines the relationship between Kal-El and Diana Prince.<br/><br/>But this film is ""The Secret Origin of Wonder Woman"", who she was, who she is, where she came from, and her first love affair, although never Requieted. And IMDb's spell checker needs to be fixed to allow the word ""Requieted"". Unrequieted. Requieted.<br/><br/>This film is not as dark and ominous as Batman V Superman, maybe it should have been. This is the DC version of Hydra, the Germans have a secret factory that makes a gas that makes Mustard Gas look like Nitrous Oxide.<br/><br/>But all of the wonderful character actors in this are cast well, especially Danny Houston. And I haven't seen Connie Nielsen since ""Gladiator"", she's aged well and commands her role. Robin Wright is the Amazon who teaches Diana.<br/><br/>These DCU movies have been panned hard, especially Dawn of Justice, and I've seen some very unfair #FakeReviews here, many of them verbatim duplicates of each other. It's doubtful that any of the people who made 1-star reviews have ever stepped foot in a theater. Still, last I looked, the rating for this film was standing up to the incredibly ridiculous bashing it has been taking from the #Fakes.<br/><br/>So I say this, if you are a real person, a DC Comics fan, a woman, or just anyone who doesn't waste their life in Reddit r/TheDonald or 4chan/b, you'll like this, I've interviewed many people who watched this, and they unanimously liked it a lot. We can't let Bots and Trolls tell us anything about Hollywood, let them watch The Apprentice, it's the only thing their mentality can grasp. Even comic books are over their heads."
"SnoopyStyle","9","13","28","4 July 2017"," hits almost every note perfectly
","Amazonian princess Diana (Gal Gadot) lives on the hidden island of Themyscira. Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) forbids her training but Antiope (Robin Wright) disobeys her. Zeus had created mankind which were corrupted by Ares, God of War. Zeus defeated him and hid Themyscira from the world. One day, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes his plane and is rescued by Diana. It's WWI and Trevor is an American spy working for the British. He had discovered that German General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) is developing a devastating new poison gas. Diana fears that Ares has returned to wreck havoc and journeys to kill a God. They travel to London where Sir Patrick (David Thewlis) is leading the peace effort.<br/><br/>The DCEU was having problems. I wouldn't say that it is in any danger but it needed an unreserved win. This is exactly that. I was leery of the choice of Gal Gadot when it was first announced. Her English was barely understandable at the time and her acting was stiff. Her English has improved by leaps and bounds and her acting is also better. The genius of Patty Jenkins is to steer into her deficiencies. Patty fully embraces her sincerity and makes all the Amazonians have the same accent as her. It's a brilliant move.<br/><br/>The other Patty brilliance is her emotional IQ. She understands human emotions better than anything in BvS. The best comparison is Martha and the double reveal of Steve's final conversation with Diana. Martha is a silly construction. The double scene is emotional heartbreak. The action is solid. The no-man's land fight is amazing. There is humor but not just the quippy Marvel humor. It is character-based and well-earned. It hits almost every note perfectly."
"pdmajumder","9","13","28","3 June 2017"," DC makes a comeback!
","I'm going to start off by saying that in the Marvel vs DC battle, I am on the side of the former. Watching those films is just like breathing in a suspicious magic potion only to find that you're under a spell you can't break free from. But this review shouldn't be about Marvel. This should just be about me telling you that finally, it is now DC's moment to shine in the spotlight. This film is a renaissance of sorts and has been able to bring back memories of the glory days--when we were all watching the Dark Knight movies (gosh, has it really been that long?).<br/><br/>There are some things that differentiate a good film from a bad one and one of those is character building. I have spent quite some time ""researching"" Marvel characters and reading their backstories, being the superhero geek that I am. But going into this film, I thought, ""I have no idea who Wonder Woman (aka Diana Prince) is and have only seen a rather dissatisfying appearance of hers in Batman vs Superman. Will I really grow to like her?"". The answer to that as I have found out now, is ""yes""-- a big one. <br/><br/>This is an origin story so obviously, there was a lot of character building. We got to know where she came from, what her beliefs were and how that affected her actions. From her childhood to her adult life, she is shown to be a very passionate and warm individual but also very strong (literally, too) and aggressive when she needs to be, which is a beautiful equilibrium that somehow suits women the best. Greatness wasn't thrust upon herâ€”she was born with it. She didn't undergo a revelation in her mid-twenties and decide that it was time for her to save the world, because she was always destined to do that and she knew it. <br/><br/>Gal Gadot, really proves her worth and makes every aspect of the character she plays, believable. A bit like Captain America, the world Wonder Woman discovers is completely alien to her and something about that genuine innocence catches my approval all the time. It is also a great source of comedy. I didn't watch Suicide Squad, so I may be wrong, but it seems to me, that this is the first DC movie that has been able to strike a very good balance between humor and gravity. Maybe they've tried to follow Marvel's footsteps, but no matter it has yielded good results. There is also a fair bit of romance in this film that a lot of other superhero movies of the recent past haven't had. Since that is another ingredient to add to the batter, I must say they've proportioned all the elements skillfully and have baked the cake quite well.<br/><br/>The film is engaging right from the very first moment. The action and tension aren't too overpowering despite the backdrop, being that of the First World War. They're there exactly when we need them to be, to keep the rhythm steady. No part of the film lags behind and makes us want to see some extra pace. <br/><br/>Another thing that stood out for me was the element of mystery right from the beginning of the film, made clear to the viewer. We know where Wonder Woman spent all her life growing up but we're never told exactly what her lineage is. That keeps us excited throughout the film, as we know there is something yet to be discovered. The twist in the last act really caught me off guard and is probably one the best ones, I've seen. Despite its long run-time it doesn't feel stretched, thanks to some great direction and editing. <br/><br/>The plot is very well conceived and apart from the obvious powers that our lead possesses and their resulting effects, nothing seems too wild to be true; no deus ex machina, here. Chris Pine's character, Captain Steve is extremely likable as well and is the perfect friend and support. Along with some other people, he and Diana give us a great display of togetherness and form quite the unlikely team of heroes.<br/><br/>However, a couple of minor shortcomings come to mind. The Amazons, Wonder Woman grew up with, don't end up being as important as they're shown to be in the beginning. They never really play a great role in anything much. I was hoping they would all come together to help our leading lady in the end but that never happens. Also, I'd have liked to see some of the events that transpired during the transition from the 1910s to the present day which lead WW to be in the place that she is now. But maybe that's for some other day. <br/><br/>These points are still, not enough to deter someone from watching this film. It is enrapturing and comes at us like a dark horse. The best thing is that now, more and more people will consider making such films with a powerful female lead. Hopefully the upcoming DC productions will be able to build a tradition of quality on this strong foundation. Maybe then, I might even begin to question my allegiance."

Wonder woman is not only an Amazon, she is a Goddess created by other gods. So, being a superhero/goddess, she has to look like a top model. Not enough muscle? The actress went to the army and has more muscle than most underweight actresses out there on the big screen. Don't like her non-American accent? She's not American. Complaining about her wearing American symbols and colour? Beyond the movie's explanation for that, it's her comic book costume since her creation. They just made it more on-screen friendly.<br/><br/>Still complaining? Have issues with the fact that she's a woman and this movie is like every other superhero movie? Sure it is, but it's like every other GOOD superhero movie out there. Don't like superhero movies? Don't go watch this one. Now, when was the last superhero movie with a woman? You're probably thinking Cat Woman, (no one remembers Electra), whose super villain was a beauty product queen with an evil product. I mean, common? Girls can't fight blood thirsty warlords or ladies that want to conquer and dominate the world? At least Wonder Woman's nemesis is the God of War, a worthy opponent.<br/><br/>Perfect? No movie is perfect. You can always develop more this or that, but it would make the movie longer. You can argue you should've cast this or that character differently. These are normal struggles for any production. You can't please everyone at the end of the day. And making the movie longer with cause other issues such as keeping the audience with the movie. But I can't give any less that 10 here. After Batman vs Superman's disaster, this is amazing. This has raised the bar for DC movies. Hope they can keep it up and this must be encouraged, both for quality and women leads."

This film represents what I always loved about DC, at their best, they are capable of telling some of the most inspiring and epic stories and this is definitely one of them, Gal Gadot was excellent as Wonder Woman, she sold not just her strength but also her kindness and also Chris Pine was fantastic in this movie as Steve Trevor, also Rupert Gregson-Williams' score is amazing, while some could say he had the advantage of already having the theme from BvS composed by Junkie XL, Rupert added more amazing themes in this film, Patty Jenkins also did a great job directing this movie, specially the action scenes, No Man's Land is by far my favorite scene of the entire film, seeing Diana wanting to fight just to save innocent lives, is just, it really gives a sense of hope from her character. My only complain is really the villains, I really felt they were underused and I wish they could have been better. While Wonder Woman doesn't hit the extreme heights of movies like The Dark Knight, is still up there with Iron Man and the original Superman movies, this is one of the best movies DC has done in years and is definitely the best movie in the DCEU, this film reminded why I love DC in the first place."
"krissaddy","9","11","23","6 June 2017"," Wonder Woman is DC's destiny's child and Patty Jenkins hit this out out of the park
","""Never send a woman to do a man's job"" they said but, I believe that ""If you want to get a job done right, get a woman to do it."" This is true of the film's director Patty Jenkins and the lead actor Gal Gadot, two female bad-asses who showed DC in specific and Hollywood in general how a fresh superhero movie is done.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman fumigates some of the conventional superhero movies tropes and refreshingly tries something old-school, it has a simple origin story, and it brings in a female perspective on the genre by upping the emotional aspects and cuts down on the acidulous elements. As someone who is new to the character, I don't know the principles this superhero stood for. Diana was written and portrayed as a woman who is innocent, hopeful, caring, empathetic, uncompromisingly good, optimistic, and fierce on the battlefield and most of all she is what an ideal superhero should be: inspiring. Gal Gadot was perfectly cast for this role. Diana thinks that it's her duty to save humanity despite the cautions by her highly protective mother who shields her from ever coming in contact with humanity up to a certain point. But Diana is a destiny's child and she has to leave the Amazonian land eventually in search of her purpose in life.<br/><br/>I was unimpressed by Gal Gadot in BvS, probably because Ben Affleck stole the show in that film. But now that she got her first standalone movie as the Wonder Woman I am thoroughly impressed by her. She is stunning in the Wonder Woman bustier and skirt but beyond that, she has this infectious charm about her; be it her smile, accent, screen presence, she is a treat to watch. She's agile in the fight sequences, she does it so naturally and with emotion, I was thoroughly impressed by that. (On a side note, Robin Wright and Connie Nielson look very fit for their age; believe it or not, they're both pushing 50s now. These women sure have some fine genes.)<br/><br/>Chris Pine as Steve plays a foil to her, while she is naive in her approach towards humanity he is more street smart yet as dutiful as Diana and knows what Diana doesn't know, that humanity is flawed and may not be worthy of her compassion. As usual, Chris plays this charming guy who has a way of impressing with his words. He has impeccable comic timing, the pauses, and his facial expressions add to his enamoring presence. The chemistry Chris shares with Gal in this film is scintillating. It's one of the main reasons why this film works. You tend to root for them. I don't remember the last time I've hoped a couple hooked up in a superhero movie before. It felt organic and real. In that way, this is a superhero-romance movie. There are many elements of romance in this film which are not present in many (any?) superhero movie to date.<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins knows how to pace her movie. This film never felt rushed or too slow, the pacing was just right. The story was simple and it gave her ample time to build the characters the way she wanted. This lady can shoot amazing action sequences. The first confrontation of the movie between the Germans and the Amazonians was a blast but arguably the standout action sequence was when Diana jumps into the front line and takes on a barrage of bullets head on, in order to defend innocent people because she feels it's her duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves. It was somehow liberating to watch her find purpose in finally doing what she trained all her life for. The action choreography is stellar and there's a grace to it.<br/><br/>The reason why this film diverges so much from the other movies in DCU though is not that of the action sequence but because it gets some of the subtle character moments dabbled sporadically, making Diana believable. There's the hilarious conversation between Steve and Diana about human reproduction, Diana trying out her clothes in London, Steve telling Diana that maybe humanity is not exactly what she thought it would be, and my favorite of these sequences comes just before she enters the war zone when Steve treats her to an ice- cream and she relishes it like a child and appreciates the ice-cream vendor saying he should be proud of himself. Even in the middle of the war sequence, she's mindful of her friends and checks to see if they are alright. These are important emotions to make a character believable. Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad were so pompous and larger than life that they forgot what superheroes stand for; the people who pit their hopes in them.<br/><br/>The final fight is not as impressive as the rest of the film but still, there are a couple of character moments that I think ground the scene. At 2 hours 20 minutes this film may be long but it doesn't ""feel"" long due to the appropriate pacing. Maybe you may start feeling a bit of the length bearing down on you during the climactic fight.<br/><br/>The dialogues and the background music need to be mentioned specifically for elevating some of the sequences in this film. We do get to hear the iconic theme music but only after almost 70 minutes into the film and as it's her first decisive fight against people who are actually trying to kill her. I think this is the second superhero film this year after Logan where the conversations flow naturally. This film had THE best dialogues in the DCU so far."
"FargoUT","9","11","23","5 June 2017"," Filled with action, humor and excitement, Wonder Woman is the best DC film since Nolan's Batman trilogy
","I grew up watching Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman, and the initial previews of this filmic rendition had me worried after the spate of lackluster DC-themed superhero films that have left me feeling cold and unimpressed. My initial worries mostly related to the dour seriousness of previous DC films (even Suicide Squad was bleak and depressing), and the visual tone seemed to suggest Wonder Woman was going to follow suit.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Patty Jenkins proves my reservations were unwarranted. Wonder Woman is an exciting, clever, and humorous introduction to the character, one of the best origin stories we've ever been gifted. After an admittedly rocky start (with some pretty terrible CGI), Jenkins turns this into a superbly assured film. Gal Gadot more than adequately steps into the boots of Lynda Carter -- she makes this Diana Prince her own, reminding me in ways of Christopher Reeve as Superman. She's awkward and gawky as she tries to blend in with the rest of human civilization. In one of the movie's more memorable scenes, Diana tries on clothes, wondering how anyone is supposed to fight in such restrictive ""armor"".<br/><br/>Chris Pine has proved his leading man status several times over, but his chemistry with Gadot is instant and charming. His secretary Etta Candy is played by scene-stealing Lucy Davis, who befriends the Amazonian princess quickly, admiring her strength and refusal to placate the male-dominated culture. Robin Wright makes an excellent and strong impression as Diana's personal trainer. <br/><br/>However, Gal Gadot is truly what makes Wonder Woman the success it is. This is her chance to prove her star-making turn in the otherwise woeful ""Batman v Superman"" was not a fluke, and she delivers in spades. Director Patty Jenkins handles all of this with an assured hand, making the action scenes fluid and comprehensible without resorting to flashy or distracting editing. I normally despise transitions from fast-to-slow motion, but Jenkins gets this right too: there's just enough to see Wonder Woman's super-human feats without falling victim to the Zack Snyder effect of removing all excitement from the scene. <br/><br/>Not just one of the best superhero movies out of the DC universe, this is one of the best superhero movies period."
"boogiejuice69","1","14","31","19 October 2017"," Dreary, slow, childish for 12yo's
","Dreary, slow, childish for 12yo's with bad acting (Thewlis, Bremner ) or no acting (Gadot, Pine) from both leads who have zero chemistry and weigh the film down with their non-event romantic sub-plot. The action is PG style with no sense of danger or horror in the WW1 trenches, the danger is provided by the main villain Thewlis who looks embarrassed to be starring in such drivel. The costumes are nice, the rest is soulless comic book garbage for Millennials with Game Of Thrones IQ's."
"jpachar82","10","14","31","11 July 2017"," The Iconic Female Superhero
","Created by American psychologist and writer William Moulton Marston, this iconic female superhero embraces history and time, literally. Born and raised by Greek gods and her mother on the island of Themyscira, Diana, the daughter of Hippolyta, was born to defeat the world's greatest enemies spanning all the way back to the dawn of the age. Let's fast forward several centuries to 1975, when Wonder Woman made her television debut with an American actress who made her famous spanning over three seasons â€“ Lynda Carter. Ms. Carter gave the character the utmost power and respect any woman figure could give a female character. Now in the hands of a newcomer, whom we were introduced to in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice â€“ Gal Godot. This iconic superhero has spanned over the centuries and now as we watch this power of a woman come alongside with Brue Wayne to defeat more of the world's enemies. Wonder Woman will no doubt in my mind become the hero that all of us need, not just women, but children and men alike - the power to tell the truth and the power of submission and the power of identity."
"icancu-28804","10","14","31","9 June 2017"," The DC movie we all deserve and 'Believe in' !!
","I won't take much of your time. Firstly, this is the only DC movie since past many years which had Bright tones and Humour through the most part(not that I'm complaining about being bleak in other movies) which made it much more watchable without being buried in deep sorrow and darkness the whole-time. Director Patty Jenkins had kept the direction to the point with wonderful stop-motion slow-mo Fight sequences(best in 3D) <br/><br/>Gal Gadot !!! This 'woman' has broken all the doubts people had on her casting. She just fit into her character so perfectly. This paved the way for further Female superhero lead movies to enter without being prejudiced.<br/><br/>Special mention to Chris Pine, Robin Wright for their better supporting role alongside Gal gadot. Chief, Charlie and Sameer were also relatable to the audience. Character development at its best!<br/><br/>Overall, it has an Excellent re-watchable value which I haven't seen in recent times and I'd definitely at least watch the climax over-and- over again !!"
"Colin0001","10","14","31","4 June 2017"," An amazing superhero film, and better than nearly all the others.
","I watched this film in the ROYAL Cinema in Barranquilla, Colombia. I say this because sometimes a setting gives an enhanced mood, and that may be why I've given this film a score of 10, instead of 9. By the way, I live in London UK and have been to all the best cinemas in the UK, and none of them come even close to the atmosphere and outrageous comfort of the cinema I was in. OK, thats an explanation of the ambiance. <br/><br/>Now onto the film itself. Gal Gadot was pretty perfect as Wonder Woman. Though other actresses could have played the role, I think this was a perfect vehicle for her. Her look is gorgeous, and I don't just mean facially, but also in the way that she carries herself in the film. She appears regal, inquisitive, caring, knowledgeable tough, tender and also resolute. She pulls all this off extremely successfully. All the other character portrayals were okay, but the quality of Gal Gadot's acting did Shine through. It wasn't sophisticated, but just pitched just right. <br/><br/>The action at times was excellent, and at other times, I felt could have used a bit more oomph. But happily, there was more to this film than just action. Each new character that was introduced was given their own little back story, so one could feel more engaged with them. I found this an important reason for the success of this film. Marvel films do not invest in the emotional history of characters, just an action history, if I may call it that. <br/><br/>There were moments of real tenderness in the film. Remarkable to see innocence so effectively played in an adult context. There is a time in the film that Wonder Woman disagrees with a decision that was made, and it made her angry. But even in this you can see how emotionally torn she is about going against her her comrades, even though she'd been proved right. <br/><br/>This film was amazing, and I will see it again in the cinema. The director knocked this out of the park. And I'm glad a female director has shown that it's not only Joss Whedon and JJ Abrams that can pull this sort of action off this well. Excellent."
"XiomaraBernard","10","14","31","3 June 2017"," I'm a Fan
","It's been a while since I've been excited about a superhero film. The last ones I remember were Spiderman (Raimi) and Batman Begins (Nolan). I found myself cheering for Diana throughout the film, especially with the performance of Gal Gadot (major girl crush on her). It literally became my favorite Superhero film. I am beyond elated for Patty Jenkin's vision (she kicked a**) and the screenplay adaptation by Allan Heinberg, phenomenal. I think you will have a great time watching this. And it's a superhero film that I will definitely see again :D"
"henryluck","9","14","31","2 June 2017"," Wonder Woman Review: A Marvel of a film
","Wonder Woman surprised me on so many levels. This character's gone from an awesome sidekick in Batman VS Superman to an awesome main lead in DC's first live action origin story of the superhero. From it's action to setting, Wonder Woman marvels! The adventure begins when Diana (Wonder Woman) rescues a young British spy (Steve Trevor) from drowning when he crash-lands in the ocean of Diana's home Themyscira. When Diana hears of the war that is raging outside of the invisible Island, Diana travels with Steve into his world to put an end to it, with the belief that the man behind the destruction is Ares, the God of War.<br/><br/>What I really liked about Wonder Woman, is how the director showed how child-like Diana reacted to the new world (London- World War 1 era) Examples of this was when she kept holding her sword and shield around something clearly out of the ordinary in London, even during World War 1 times. This kind of child-like approach to the new world helps flesh out Diana's personality as she's in a world completely different from her own. Speaking of her personality, Diana is a very attachable and admirable character because she fights for the safety of innocents and is willing to fight to ensure their safety, something gifted to her from her upbringing by her amazon queen mother. I also liked how Wonder Woman comes to the realisation that people are just plain evil and there often is not just ""one bad person."" This questioning of morality really helped to flesh out Wonder Woman's character even further as it changed her perspective of what the real world is like.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman's also got the action to match the character as well. The movie makes amazing use of sound to deliver earth-echoing sound in the cinema every time Wonder Woman smashed a mortar away with her shield for example or smashed through debris like a bull. Wonder Woman's weapons are also showcased beautifully and fit incredibly well with the film's setting. The weapons even felt real as well with Wonder Woman's weapons like her sword and shield shining beautifully as well as having some shadows to the explosive firing of a cannon. The best part was that nothing looked suspect in terms of CGI.<br/><br/>The film even looks amazing too and the amount of detail that was put into this film really helped to flesh out the worlds, from the breath-taking Greek inspired Themyscira to the gritty war torn battlefields of World War 1. Each place had a unique personality that made it easier to follow the story. Even though the film had some gritty moments during the London and battlefield scenes, they were rarely distracting.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman was exactly the film to put the DC extended universe on the map. Wonder Woman has gotten the film she deserved since her breath-taking appearance in Batman VS Superman. Here's the hoping that Justice League and more DC films will be just as amazing, just like Wonder Woman's theme! ðŸ˜ƒ 9/10 Is it better then? Batman VS Superman: Dawn Of Justice- Yes. Wonder Woman has a much more likable protagonist as well as having a more centred plot and less CGI action.<br/><br/>Man of Steel- Yes. Even though Man of Steel has a larger scale, Wonder Woman feels more impactful and feels much more rememberable.<br/><br/>Suicide Squad- Yes. Wonder Woman has much more charisma and is unlikely to have anyone cringing."
"gerry_barnaby","10","14","31","1 June 2017"," Incredible character adaptation Gal Gadot was incredible and beautiful.
","This is the true an honest review you about to get from, this film blow me away straight up no lie, its's not just on the passion that gone into this film but the emotional content as well that just blow me away in so many ways that had me in tears by the end of the film.<br/><br/>The direction and dialog of the film is incredibly done to bring one hell of a film with ""love"", ""adventure"", and message to the world that bring wonder woman character out the right way on screen. The hype is real as director ""Patty Jenkins"" has done an incredible job on this film with a great balance of humour, inspiration moments and the incredible sound track as well just made the dramatic scene amazing it gave me chills.<br/><br/>The emotional scene in the second and third act gave this film a brilliant way to end, which i was seriously holding back the tears it really hit the heart; when a film can do this you know this is a fantastic film. The film is so perfectly done with the first half the film showing Diana growing up around the amazons on the island of Themyscira as the film give the audience a back story of the gods which perfectly sets up the character Aries.<br/><br/>The way this film show the woman is brilliant done in a way that it not this overbearing feministic theme, it show men and woman as equals which is brilliant special when it comes to Steve and Diana character as Steve is like an equal to the character of wonder woman it comes off brilliantly on screen.<br/><br/>Connie Nielsen performance as Queen Hippolyta the Queen of the Amazons in Greek mythology was amazing not only playing the mother role but also playing the queen with concern about Diana, Robin Wright in her own right was a bad ass on screen as we she her kicking ass in the first half of the film playing hippolyta sister Antiope who train Diana too hippolyta displeasure.<br/><br/>Elena Anaya perfect casting choice for Dr. Maru aka Dr poison as we she her character as this psychopathic Alchemist creating some thing that could single handily destroy the world she play this role brilliantly with Danny Huston character who was actually a real German general in the first world war by the name Ludendorff, who came across very ruthless which i feel was Aries influence on him.<br/><br/>David Thewlis performance was actually dam good in a ""Alec Guinness"" way with a someone sinister tone in the third act, but as Aries he was seriously good, although these scene were C.G.I which was the only way you could do this, which was one hell of a fight scene with Diana, he done amazing in this film.<br/><br/>Chris Pine performance is one of the best his done playing Steve Trevor playing this guy that strong but weakness at time, but his dialog throughout the film is well written with some emotional parts and the on screen chemistry with Gal Gadot was amazing which just added to the film flare.<br/><br/>One thing people were worried about was can Gal Gadot pull wonder woman character off as we only saw her character in full warrior mode in third act of Batman v superman, i can honest say you can't keep your eyes off her throughout the whole film. Not only is she incredible beautiful in the film ; her acting playing this woman that's never been in the world of men, let alone seen a man is incredible.<br/><br/>The way she come across which add's to the character is the naive woman unlike what we saw in Batman v superman, she is complete someone that new to everything like this natural curiosity to everything which she pull's off incredibly on screen; giving the wonder woman character the justice it need on screen.<br/><br/>Although the most of the third act ""EPIC!"" battle is c.g.i, you can easily forgive this has the rest of the film is amazingly directed, with the film score as well is probably one of the best movie sound tracks that not only adds to the dramatic effect of the film just give that edge it needed. Special the scene we've seen in the trailer when Diana step out on to the battle field on the tench the sound track playing then gave the scene an inspiring powerful moment of heroism.<br/><br/>There seriously is nothing i can faultier about this film, its great soundtrack, acting performance from all, Gal Gadot Chris pine and the others just made this film for what it is, its a must to watch you would be a fool to miss this film.<br/><br/>Dislikes : The only nick picking i would give is Aries Armour which I'm sure some people will complain again, i do feel it could of been better designed, but it was OK as the scene was to epic to actually care about that fault."
"makleen2","8","7","13","29 September 2017"," A Dark Fantasy-Adventure
","Wonder Woman was written by Zack Snyder and Allan Heinberg and directed by Patty Jenkins. It stars Gal Gadot as Diana, Chris Pine as American spy Steve Trevor, and Danny Huston as General Ludendorff.<br/><br/>Diana/Wonder Woman is a young, fearless woman with a mysterious destiny who lives on an idyllic island with fellow Amazon warriors. They spend their days preparing for a conflict with the Greek god of war, Ares. One day, a pilot (Steve Trevor) crash lands in the ocean and Diana saves him. The German Navy is in pursuit, and after a brief battle the Amazons defeat the German search party. Diana helps Trevor get off the island and return to 1918 Europe, where she thinks Ares has orchestrated the First World War.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is enjoyable and fast-paced. It's 141 minutes but never feels that long. The action is never exhausting until the end, when of course there has to be some apocalyptic battle between Wonder Woman and Ares. Through interacting with a cast of characters from 1918 Europe and America, Diana becomes disillusioned with humanity. In the end, Trevor's sacrifice to destroy a new poison gas developed by General Ludendorff's chemist, Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya), makes Diana realize humanity might be worth saving after all.<br/><br/>The ""fish out of water"" scenes are genuinely funny and charming. The interaction between Diana and Trevor is great, but you never really have a sense of them falling in love (they share an identical dance scene to the one between Peter Quill and Gamora in Guardians of the Galaxy to establish their chemistry). It's another ""two hot people hook up""-type of romance.<br/><br/>When the Germans attack the island, it goes about how you would expect when people with modern rifles fight people with bows and arrows. Finally, I thought, a superhero movie that doesn't feel like you're watching a video game. My enthusiasm was short lived. Later in the movie, Wonder Woman plows through hundreds of faceless soldiers. In one scene, she throws a tank and the German soldiers keep fighting (what would you do if you saw someone throw a tank?)! <br/><br/>I'm also uncomfortable with the way the filmmakers chose to make a historic figure, General Erich Ludendorff, a main antagonist. Ludendorff was 51 in 1916 when he became quartermaster general, overseeing the German war effort. After World War One, he became an advocate of Total War. While he was a hard man (even his wife described him as humorless), a conspiracy theorist, and authoritarian, he wasn't a cartoonish super villain. He's the only historical figure in the entire movie. I'm not sure what purpose his inclusion served when the filmmakers could have easily invented a fictional German general and no one would have noticed. It's not like a film about a comic book character needs some kind of historical validity.<br/><br/>The plot involving the poison gas didn't make much sense. First, if its purpose was to make gas masks ineffective, why would the Germans test it on a village full of civilians? Second, what military purpose would it serve to aerial drop it over the frontline where it would kill both friendly and enemy troops? Why not load the gas onto artillery shells? A friend suggested this was something Ares whispered into Ludendorff's ear because his goal was to kill off humanity, which is plausible I guess.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie undermines its own message. Wonder Woman wants to stop Ares because without war, the world will be a paradise. Ares' follower, Ludendorff, argues that war is good because it brings out human courage, honor, and self sacrifice. In the end, Ludendorff is proved right. Without the war, Trevor would never have been able to sacrifice himself and show Diana there are human qualities worth saving.<br/><br/>Contrast this with the ending of The Fifth Element (1997), when Leeloo, the supreme being, goes into shock when she sees the horrors humanity has inflicted. Korben Dallas shows her humanity should be saved because of our capacity for love. By expressing his love for Leeloo, Dallas provides the ""fifth element"" essential for life. By choosing self sacrifice over love as the redemptive quality, Wonder Woman accidentally makes war and conflict an essential feature of humanity.<br/><br/>None of this is to say Wonder Woman is a bad movie. As far as super hero films are concerned, this is in the top ten, but that doesn't make it infallible. I wish the filmmakers had paid as much attention to the plot as they did the action, pacing, humor, and visual style."

Without exception, Wonder Woman has risen to everyone's expectations and I don't think there are much people to argue with about this thing. Well, yes, it could have been better on some sides, like the acting point, but who cares, as long as it is above the average, with a well deserved rating of 8.

","What were Warner Bros and DC comics smoking when they decided to make Batman vs Superman and Suicide Squad? Or what were they smoking when they decided to release Wonder Woman (WW) before Justice League?<br/><br/>Whatever they were smoking, the latter was the better stuff because the only word I can think off describing this movie is fantastic !! Yup !!<br/><br/>The previous two releases with huge star casts and big budget action sequences were to be told in truth plain boring. WW is like the monsoon in India, refreshing and entertaining.<br/><br/>To be frank, there is nothing new in WW if you scratch the surface. It is the coming of age of person who has superpowers and fights a villain to protect the world, a sample template of all superhero films.<br/><br/>But WW is different because the superhero is a woman and that where Patty Jenkins and the writers catch our attention and surprise us. When was the last time we saw a movie completely dedicated to woman superhero?? <br/><br/>They get most of things perfect from the word go. Amazons, the place where WW is born and belongs to is visually mind blowing and beautiful. The warrior women star cast is perfect with Nelson and Wright perfectly playing Diana's mother and aunt. Special mention to Wright who is terrific in action sequences inspite of her age.<br/><br/>And then comes Chris Pine who is so happy to play second fiddle to WW. He is the catalyst and the wow factor for women audience. He and WW share a fabulous chemistry on screen and have some nice comic moments too.<br/><br/>The movie takes time to build up and the setting of WW One is prefect. And there is that one beautiful action set piece with WW taking on the Germans on the battlefield and single handedly destroying them. Perfect.<br/><br/>And finally, there is Gal Gadot aka WW aka Diana. Gadot seems to have been born to play WW. She has the physique, the personality and the acting skills to play this role. I don't think any other actor would have done justice to this part. She is breath taking in the action sequences and what we saw of her in Batman vs Superman was just a trailer. She owns this role.<br/><br/>The action sequences are good and the technically its a pretty neat film.<br/><br/>However, the climax was tad disappointing and the villain was big let down. Thewlis is fine actor but not suited to play the villain. Plus the villain's role was poorly written. Even Dr. Maru's role was not well written and I hope to see more of her sometime in the future.<br/><br/>But its still a great film and a must watch for movie buffs. If you are a woman you will love it as its all about women empowerment. For men, watching Gadot in short skirts beating the hell out of the bad guys is fulfilling. <br/><br/>Can't wait for the sequel. he he he."
"peeradon","8","7","13","3 June 2017"," Outstanding! Amazing but not flawless.
","Wonder Woman for me is like a movie straight out of the classic superhero era which you will experience a romance, humors, emotional and inspiring scenes full of actions and a whole new combat fighting styles throughout the movie. Some scenes are fantastic and some scenes just look out of place but they are not too obvious, just noticeable in most cases. <br/><br/>After leaving the cinema the movie will left you with a good and beautiful memories I can't even explain it in the first place and must take time to analyze the symbols and meanings of some specific spectacular scenes for awhile. I can say without any doubt that Wonder Woman is the game-changer movie of the Detective Comics Extended Universe by Warner Bros. Pictures. Men will love it, Women will love it, the elders and kids will love it. All that been said are the factors that made Patty Jenkins my another most favorite visionary director on the list!<br/><br/>All in all, If you love superhero movies- Wonder Woman will not disappoint you. But if you hope for a great plot twist not just a symbolic ending, then you will be a little disappointed."

As I have stated in the past, I look at films from two different perspectives simultaneously as I watch them: One, from an entertainment perspective. Two, from a complete and whole film perspective, Oscar-worthy, if you will. While there is always a heavy debate about Oscars, no matter the opinion, 'Wonder Woman' entertained me from the very start to the very end. With an excellent blend of story, action, comedy, and so on, it truly has become one of my favorite superhero films. Gal Gadot hits a home-run playing WW. She owns this role and I truly hope there is a deep future for her in this role. The action thoroughly blew me away with the acceptance of some silly CG at times. I desperately hope Patty Jenkins will continue to have ties to the DC Universe because she led this film to greatness. As I sit and wonder where this ranks among comic book films; I can confidently say it sits among the top. Just under 'Logan' and resides among Marvel's best and clearly is the DC Extended Universe's best.<br/><br/>-- Oberrated --"

","******SPOILERS: JUST SEE THIS MOVIE AND MAKE YOUR OWN MIND UP FIRST ~ THEN READ THIS! DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT - JUST WATCH IT ********<br/><br/>I just came back from seeing this movie at the bfi IMAX in Waterloo. There were much fewer people at this first screening than for any other movie, only about half or one-third sold. I have avoided watching any trailers or news or commentary, as I've found this completely ruins movies for me. From watching Batman vs Superman I was not sold on Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman - at all! Forlornly I re-watched the original series with Lynda Carter and laughed along with the early original comics and really felt they had missed such a great opportunity to show the massively fun side of Wonder Woman. I was wrong, and i'm Gladot that I was! The audience laughed at some bits that were a bit wooden or melodramatic and then were in hysterics as the banter begins, pushing the envelope more from what i expected from a DC movie, somewhat like Deadpool did for the MCU haha, because it was just like the original comics (+!) and she represents that true Wonder Woman well A+ !!! I felt at times like I was watching Frances Dee in a comedy role or a female Buster Keaton, the physicality of the humour;a complete flip-side to the couple of scenes that were a bit serious and flat - the audience accepted this as tongue-in-cheek, like we were all watching The Room or Spinal Tap together. We cheered her on. The characters and acting all were great in the sum-total of things. I am impressed by this witty Wonder Woman popcorn flick! *""Wonder Woman!""* Woo!"
"tribalizer-968-232027","10","12","26","3 September 2017"," An absolute gem!
","We see how the little Princess Diana, the daughter of Queen Hippolyta of the island of Themyscira, grows up to be a great warrior and a superhero. Against her mother's will she leaves the bright world of Themyscira to the dark and grey real world, in the middle of the World War I with Captain Steve Trevor, an American pilot who just earlier crashed in the coast of Themyscira tailed by German soldiers. In the real world Diana has to hide her true identity and goes by the name of Diana Prince. Convinced that the God of War Ares is responsible of all the conflict she starts to fight the Germans (not yet Nazis this early in history) in search for Ares that hides in plain sight as a human.<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. Wonder Woman is a wonderful origin story of a great superhero. The ordinary, but still great story is beautifully written by Zack Snyder, Allan Heinberg and Jason Fuchs. Patty Jenkins' directing is absolutely flawless, the scenes are just pleasure to watch, and all the actors are very comfortable in their roles. None of the characters are annoying in any way (not even Steve's funny secretary Etta Candy) which is quite rare in superhero movies where usually many of the actors are just pretentious posers. The editing is perfect, the story goes smoothly from beginning to the end. Rupert Gregson-Williams' score is beautiful and brings out a feeling of a real adventure. The film's tone is brighter, lighter and softer than in DC films in general, which suits Wonder Woman. All the jokes are in the right place and there's no unnecessary forced comedy. The action is not throughout the film, which is good, because even in the wartime the action is not everywhere all the time. The fighting scenes are stunning and the slow motions make the scenes pleasant and you can really see what's happening when many characters fight against each other. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with Zack Snyder's involvement as one of the writers. If you have failed to understand Man Of Steel or Batman vs Superman, don't blame the wrong man. For DC Entertainment good stories are so much more important than just the easiest way to the cash and the audience with the Marvel way. Wonder Woman must be watched fairly without any comparison. You should check your attitude before watching this. If you expect to see cgi driven nonstop action in all the colours of the rainbow surrounding a thin story line, you will be disappointed. This is NOT a Marvel movie. Wonder Woman has been praised for a good reason and is not overrated in any way. I understand that this is a good place for the angry Marvel fans to throw in their ignorant 1/10 reviews with made up flaws to deliberately make the score to drop. There just aren't any grounds for most of the allegations. DC is getting lots of unnecessary rumouring and negative discredit every time they come out with a new movie. The simple truth is that Wonder Woman is an absolute gem among superhero movies!"
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8","12","26","20 August 2017"," An undeniably great DCEU movie
","Comic book movies have long been underway for a few decades now. It was only until the 1990s were more properties beginning to show up. This was the trial stage for characters that were very much obscure to most. Then during the early 2000s, more properties were getting adaptations and with greater receptions. Though there were still flubs along the way, the code was for the most part cracked on making successful superhero films. After the 2010s, Marvel Studios had found a method of perfecting their films that many would envy for today. Of those Warner Brothers was struggling for a while to get their famous heroes going. Superman Returns (2006), Jonah Hex (2010) and Green Lantern (2011) all pretty much fell flat in getting an expanded universe going. It was only Christopher Nolan's Batman series that really got any attention. At last Warner Bros. made Man of Steel (2013), Suicide Squad (2016) and Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), but all were mixed. Here though we have something much better.<br/><br/>As popular as Wonder Woman is, the character had not had a live action venture into cinemas once. Before this she had only been portrayed in fan-made shorts, animated home video films and her own TV show in 1975. That's it though. Plus seeing how things turned out with Warner Brothers few entries in their shared universe, it was a bit worrisome thinking how this might turn out. The good news is, this feature is much better than anything so far. Written mainly by Allan Heinberg, the screenplay was well crafted for this adaptation. Surprisingly Heinberg had only worked on TV productions before this. Gal Gadot plays Diana, an Amazonian who is protected by her fellow sisters and mother from Ares, the god war. The thing is Diana does not know how powerful she truly is. When a pilot by the name of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes nearby, Diana learns of World War I that's going on around her. Believing she can make a difference and that Ares is the cause of the problem, she goes where no man would ever want to.<br/><br/>Directed by Patty Jenkins, the director of Monster (2003), the vision she had for the film is competently fulfilled. The top actors all do a great job under her wing. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman gives a charming performance, with strength and tenderness all in one. Not only can she play a likable heroine but also can really pull off some tough sequences. Her development is also handled very well. There are so many points in which she learns about mankind. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor plays an admirable soldier. He too learns off of Diana for her lack of understanding. The rest of the supporting cast act enthusiastically too. Connie Nielsen as Diana's mother can stand her ground quite well. Danny Huston as Ludendorff, the main backer behind the Great War is intimidating in his portrayal along with his mad scientist Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya). There's also appearances from Robin Wright, David Thewlis, Saïd Taghmaoui, and Ewen Bremner. All of which follow Diana in her journey to stop Ares.<br/><br/>The only thing that might pose a problem to viewers may the portrayal of some characters. One character in particular is played by someone who doesn't exactly fit the role. Although in the end, they are not seen that much, it still may be a bit off putting. The action scenes shot in this film are well staged too. Unlike the past DCEU films, this one uses a mixture of CGI and what feels like practical effects. As the film reaches its third act, it is already assumed CGI would be the biggest driver in visuals, but at least here it doesn't look like video game cut scenes. That was all too abundant in movies like Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Plus the progression of the action scenes change over time too. This gives the viewers a nice dose of all kinds of firepower. Whether that be sword fights, superhero powers or trench warfare, it keeps the experience new and interesting. The best scene was probably in ""No Man's Land"", where Diana takes over the battleground. Can't do that in Call of Duty.<br/><br/>The camera-work was another pleasing element. Managed by Matthew Jensen, the cinematography was put together very professionally. No shaky cameras were used in the making of this production and the lens is as wide as it gets for the ultimate landscape view. The color pallet is also a great addition to the settings. Where Diana grew up as compared to the land where the war was being fought had drastic differences. This was used to emphasize the contrasts in man's corruption. Jensen had also done work for movies like Chronicle (2012) and Fantastic Four (2015). For music, the film score was composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams, the brother Harry Gregson-Williams, another composer. For his work, Rupert did an adequate job. Unfortunately as important as reviving an original theme is, Rupert brings back Hans Zimmer ugly electric cello theme for Diana. It just doesn't fit. Nevertheless the music (including that theme) work in making a unique sound for Wonder Woman. It's an effective score with a number of good moments.<br/><br/>Finally, the DCEU has a film that can be called a great movie. The best part is, is that it's of a character who hasn't gotten their own movie yet. Aside from the portrayal of a couple characters, the rest of the film in its entirety works great. The music, camera-work, action, actors and writing are all top notch."
"FelipeCarrillo","9","12","26","20 August 2017"," ""I am Diana of Themyscira, daughter of Hippolyta, and your wrath upon this world is over""
","In times of cholera like these, we must thank psychologist William Moulton Marston for having conceived the first superheroine of comics of the history, who has managed to proclaim her history and ideology to thousands of ears, minds and hearts thirsting for peace, love and justice after seventy-six years of comings and goings.<br/><br/>Lynda Carter got, not only the sex symbol label in the seventies at the expense of her courageous performance over three seasons in the DC Comics TV series, she also was proud of embodying for the very first time a strong, intelligent, charismatic and comprehensive woman both on the small screen, in the comic universe of superheroes and in that misogynist society of which we have not been getting away yet. However, like everything in this earthly life, the exuberant actress had to say goodbye to her time of victory, leaving as a reminder an unblemished legacy, inherent nostalgia emerging from this character and seven decades of vignettes that made the delights of comic lovers of yesteryear. However, the social, political and cultural phenomenon threatens to come out again thanks to the triumph of a war/comic/superhero/dramatic/romantic—and before all these banal classifications—inspirational and transcendent production, which was conceived by director Patty Jenkins next to new and perfect Wonder Woman actress, Gal Gadot, of course, with the extensive assistance of a unisex crew, captained economically, by American monster film production company Warner Bros.<br/><br/>As a general rule, each released movie must follow, at least, a specific storyline in connection with the universe that the studio wishes to put together, such as its counterpart Marvel Studios, because of which, the events are placed just after the ending of ""Batman V Superman"", with a seasoned and circumspect Diana Prince receiving a package, which motivates the corresponding presentation of her origins, using as a narrative conductor a shabby photograph taken on her first vacation to the harsh, fierce and paradoxically inhumane real world: the World War I. However, the film slides much further back, promptly to Themyscira, Diana's origin land and an idyllic Greek kingdom where the most powerful, clever and complete females reside, thanks to work and grace of Zeus in order to inspire peace and union in a world tamed by Ares brutality, the main rival of both the father of the gods and the Amazon warriors, a tribe led by overprotective Queen Hippolyta and her sister, General Antiope. The hurdle that, sooner or later, they had to face will come after Steve Trevor, pilot and spy of the United States Army, who accidentally falls into the ocean of the island with a bundle of horrid realities under his arms, forcing the predicted awakening of Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>It was neither for lack of intent nor because of scarcity of support and execution sources, it was by a shortage of professionalism that the superheroines world had not had the succor that male heroes possess today. However, the American huge studios — so similar but so dissimilar — have taken matters into their own hands, either by the unfading desire of fans or by the boom around the absolute abolition of misogyny in the different human fields. Warner Brothers Pictures was the one which took the initiative several years ago, using Zack Snyder as casting director to finally select Gal Gadot, the Wonder Woman from cover to cover by reason of her acting skills and dominant emotional strength as she pops on the screen. While the company was recovering from the colossal setback that meant the inaugural stage of its cinematic universe — incited by Christopher Nolan's near excellent trilogy — at the hands of the grandiloquent ""Man of Steel"" (2013), a vilified and muddled ""BvS"" (2016) and the oversaturated and decaffeinated ""Suicide Squad"" (2016); the high members deliberated what would be the course that the mega project should take, since although all previous movies had a lucky reception at the box office, they don't convince any one within critics circle. Then, the next step fell into the hands of Jenkins, a director whose experience was strictly based on the small screen and her prestigious directorial debut: ""Monster"", which Charlize Theron won an Academy Award. The writers' and the filmmaker's ambitions to bring back ""WW"" were so fervent, fascinating and prevailing that the company gave a vote of confidence for an Amazon princess with a nuance much more from Marvel, she is who lifted that vile shade flying over DC, once and for all. And what a success! <br/><br/>With a smaller budget, besides other productions, this origin story communicates an anti-war message of brotherhood and innocence through the different angles that story touches, from her formation as a warrior until the frigid and cutting confrontation with the land of men. <br/><br/>Sequences as the ascension of the walls of a high tower, the sublime struggle in the arenas of Themyscira, the combat in the village against the German officers or the self-same Zeus or her already classic allegorical scene in which she arises among bullets and explosions, encouraged by the masterful composition of Hans Zimmer; A portentous setting, cinematography and photography that remind the work of ""Fantastic Beasts""; first-grade special effects that, although on several occasions are perceptible and somewhat ineffective, draw each of the locations and struggles with an enviable sophistication, a story brimming with love and bravery — thanking a fascinating twist —; high octane performances and a direction teaching in each frame, all that make ""Wonder Woman"" a wonderful and, for someones, painful triumph."
"coorloff27","3","12","26","13 July 2017"," Not what I was expecting
","I went in with pretty high expectations. Okay not high, but at least something similar to the caliber of superhero movies. I didn't get it. There were so many things that were off about the movie. The movie tries to be super feminist but in the end its very much like a chick flick. You know why, the superhero chooses 'love'? Would you ever see a male superhero choosing love? I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but she is the daughter of freaking Zeus. Act like the Goddess she was meant to be! Overall, plot was very weak, hardly any story to follow. Which would have been fine is the run time was not so long! Honestly I wasted my time. Just because I'm a woman, doesn't mean I'm going to give a female movie a good rating if it doesn't deserve it."

Not only this movie single handledly saved the DCEU from being extinct, it is also a game changer for super hero movies in general. Featuring Gal Gadot, known mostly for her role in the Furious movies, as well as Chris Pine, Robin Wright, and Connie Nielsen, and directed by the woman who directed the Academy Award winning Monster back in 2003, this film has become the most successful film made by a woman of all time globally and domestically. Despite its length, it moves at a smooth pace and never lets go. The special effects are amazing, the sound mix awesome, and the cinematography and acting top notch. In a summer where every movie is a reboot or a sequel, Wonder Woman is a fresh breath of air from the everyday worries of the real world. Go see it once, maybe even twice!!!"

And the god of war--Ares whom I thought is a symbol(do not exist). Then I found I was wrong again.<br/><br/>The movie is ""patient"". We get the chance to see in depth Diana's motives and why she ""walked away from mankind"" 100 years ago, and why she returned to protect this world forever.Beautiful landscapes in Themiscyra, a great first act. Then, after Diana leaves her home, we get to see her adjusting in the outside world, and realizing what this war is really about.Every action scene, especially those with her theme song in the background and the combination of darkness and humor are absolutely fascinating.<br/><br/>I liked every performance, but Gal Gadot was the best by far, portraying Diana exceptionally.

Hans Zimmer is the man behind the Wonder Woman theme music it's a perfect theme for the movie. I forgot 2 names Chris Pine you are stunning and one of the best character got on your career. Another person is Robin Wright I didn't see her fighting sequences till date she is fantastic, her fighting sequences in the movie very much surprised me she is superb at this age.<br/><br/>All in all it's a must watch movie and perfect movie for all the audiences.

"JasonR77","10","13","29","4 June 2017"," Wonderful
","Wonder Woman may possibly be the greatest superhero movie ever produced. There, I said it. The challenge before Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot was a formidable one; bring the legendary superhero to life on the big screen for her first solo adventure, and do it in such a way that it blows away the ridiculous conventions that have long dogged female-fronted superhero films. Even Marvel, as progressive as they are, shied away from giving Scarlett Johansson a chance to fly solo as the popular and complex Black Widow. This is a pressure not easily handled, especially with the entire DC film universe to this point being largely disappointing in the eyes of critics, and divisive among audiences. DC needed a break, a fine film that could finally show that its universe could be every bit as good as Marvel's. Enter Gal Gadot. The decision to insert Wonder Woman into Batman vs. Superman, and get the mythical Trinity on the screen at the same time, was masterful. Gal Gadot was made for this role; tall, stunning, and naturally Mediterranean, as Diana should be. Add to that the single best entrance a superhero has ever made, complete with a guitar-licking theme, and audiences and critics alike reached agreement. No matter their thoughts on the overall film, she was a highlight. So, the torch was passed to Patty Jenkins for the titular origin story, and she ran with it. The implications of this film's success are well documented, and it finally does break through the fog of the other DC films. We see Diana, the secrecy of her birth in tow, grow to become the great warrior before leaving with Steve Trevor and entering World War I. Her innocence and naivete upon entering our world makes for a complex thread as she spends more and more time around man while seeking her quarry. She sees man's pain, suffering, and simple pleasures, and even despite her singular belief as to what must happen, she becomes emotionally grounded, which becomes key when the climax arrives. The big reveal is compelling, and Jenkins does a fantastic job at dangling lines out there before reeling it in with a terrific, if long, battle sequence. Gal Gadot has made a star turn here, and future Wonder Woman sequels are sure to happen, as this film delivers on all counts: Diana's relationship with Trevor is multifaceted, funny and interesting, and produces some truly touching moments. The action sequences are exciting and gloriously fun, and that moment when Diana casts aside her cloak and steps forth in her full armor the first time is mesmerizing. The DC Universe now has its first truly great film. Ball's in your court, Marvel."
"Bucketlip","10","13","29","1 June 2017"," A wonderful movie full of heart, inspiration, and fun action - everything that a comic book movie is supposed to be.
","Saw advanced release in Florida tonight in an AMC Dolby Digital theater. Just returned and I was so pleased at how well the story unfolded and how quickly 2 hours and 20 minutes passed. I purposely avoided spoilers. I read other reviews (non-spoiler) that claimed the 2nd act dragged. I didn't think it dragged at all. It was important to set up the third act and contained most of the humor. Gal Gadot shines brilliantly and IS Wonder Woman. All those detractors have some major crow to eat. She is beautiful, strong, engaging, convincing and amazing in the action sequences. Her presence is undeniable and those who whined that she was too...( fill in the blank) will be forced to reassess after seeing this movie. Story is tight. Chris Pine is excellent as a co-star but it's Gal's movie. The finale is impressive and leaves little doubt that Diana becomes a powerful force for good. She is what the DCEU Superman needs to evolve into and the one who can keep Batman on track. Her message of love and hope were strong and Patty Jenkins did a great job of mixing in humor, narrative, moving sequences and great, fun action. I will be seeing it again."

","Wow! This is one of the best superhero movies since The Dark Knight. And kudos to director Patty Jenkins and the wonderful Gal Gadot. She really has a great chemistry with Chris Pine. I would recommend this to everyone especially comic book fans. For the Amazon princess herself, Wonder Woman. Before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana Prince. As a young lass, Diana wants to become like her mother, Hippolyta, to protect the world from war god, Ares. Like what she said, Truly, only love can save the world. Gal Gadot really gave a brilliant performance as the Amazon princess. Wonder Woman was one of DC's most beloved superheroes. This film has a brilliant acting and picturesque cinematography and cool action and humor. Everyone stole the show. So far, this is one of 2017's best movies. My verdict: 10 out of 10"
"amesmonde","Null","10","21","8 June 2017"," One of the better most rounded super hero movies
","Diana leaves her paradise Island magically hidden from the rest of the world to fight alongside men in a war to end all wars.<br/><br/>Directed by Patty Jenkins, Wonder Woman is a pleasing film in a sea of other superhero flicks. What it gets right is a good mix of action and narrative helped by the back drop of The Great War/World War I. While arguably it lags in the final act, mainly due to the seeming obligatory big boss final battle showdown it for the most part swiftly moves along. Part new origin story on the island of Themyscira, home to the Amazons, you see the character honing her powers and becoming Wonder Woman. Later when she helps a spy (Chris Pine) and they journey to Europe circa 1913, she's finds that she is a fish out of water in her new surroundings in searching for the god of war. <br/><br/>Allan Heinberg's screenplay has a few twists and plays with the sexiest elements of the period. Nevertheless, it slightly sells itself out at times with all the tropes of a love story with at times Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman playing second fiddle to Pine's American spy pilot. Thankfully these are few and far between, but it's still an unnecessary dynamic.<br/><br/>There's a top cast full of familiar faces including David Thewlis, Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright with the sets and costumes being Oscar worthy. This incarnation supersedes Wonder Woman 1967 pilot, Lynda Carter's TV pop icon version complete with memorable theme and Adrianne Palicki's failed pilot. Gadot may not be everyone's idea of what Diana Prince/Wonder Woman should look like, however, she is great in the role carrying the naive innocence having been on a hidden island almost all of her life with the power and presence that we saw glimpses of in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). There's also some present day scenes that fit nicely with Zack Snyder's outing and Justice League (2017). With plenty fight scenes the new Hans Zimmer & Junkie XL Wonder Woman theme kicks in fittingly and Rupert Gregson-Williams' score captures the atmosphere of the respective settings.<br/><br/>Overall, Wonder Woman is probably one of the most rounded entertaining super hero movies out there with its war themes ironically just as relevant today."

","DC has finally given us the movie we expected to see and it was brilliant. It had interesting characters, gave thought provoking dialogue, an incredible empowering female lead that screamed hell yeah baby this is 2017, and fantastic action scenes. Anyone who see's this movie will be pleased whether you are a DC fan or not. Therefore, not watching this movie in the cinema would be robbing yourself from some wholesome entertainment. In fact, not even going to the cinema is enough, if you are going to see this movie you should make the choice I did and see it in a Dolby digital cinema near you because only then will you experience the intensity this movie has to offer. I envy those who have yet to see this movie because I can never see it with fresh eyes again. Now go out, have fun watching it and enjoy because I know I did."

","Finally, a film that has the charms, likable characters, coherent story line... and provides good entertainment.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is a great choice for Diana Prince and the rest of the cast were good choices also. It's not going to win any acting awards but adequate for this sort of film. <br/><br/>The strength of the film lies in the main characters and how their journey and story together were told, in my opinion WB/DC have failed at this with Man of Steel, Batman vs Superman and definitely Suicide Squad, but Wonder Woman is a tier or two better in presenting this to the audience.<br/><br/>Worthy to compare to Marvel Studio's better efforts for sure.<br/><br/>If you like superhero films... go watch it, I highly recommend it."

","7.5 stars? Anything above 7 is usually good.. but not this crap. Diana or Wonder Woman is noticeably weaker, smaller, younger, skinnier, more naive than any of the other women from Amazonia, yet she is the one that goes out to save the world... eeeek. Her stunt double was clearly a lot more fit, with having more muscle in her legs, a broader back and larger shoulders; which is what the main actress should have looked like! It is not believable to have a 'model thin woman' fight German soldiers. Thor wasn't a skinny, neither was Wolverine or Batman. Spider-Man had a suit which gave him powers, Iron Man had a brain that build him a suit which in return gave him immense power and Wonder woman gives her Sword and Shield away to some secretary to drag around London streets, and then shoves the sword in behind her back when she's in her gala dress because the poor girl literally had NO WHERE to store her Shiel and Sword throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>The story line should never had involved German Soldiers and the WW1. It was like the movie was written and directed by those whom never read a history book or graduated high school. It was laughable and really a darn mockery was made out of that war by the people of this movie.<br/><br/>Chris Pine did not do justice to the movie, it was like he just plays the same character in every movie that he's casted for. He didn't train for this role! ...When you see Pine in a movie, you know it won't be a good one.<br/><br/>The script.. ohhhhh the script was tragic, pay attention to what the main characters say and you'll be Flabbergasted. Also, the accents!!! The accents come and go for everyone in that movie!<br/><br/>Also how many times did Steven yell ""Dianna"" in the movie? And vise versa..

"davidspader","7","6","11","14 February 2018"," Not a movie for the boys
","Interesting reading the comments for this movie. I would guess that most of the negative ""reviews"" are from males in the 18-to-28-year-old demographic who have been weaned on the vast catalogue of male-dominated action-hero films and the increasingly violent video games of the last couple of decades. I suspect also that these ""reviewers"" are not so much disappointed with the movie but more likely threatened by the idea of a woman - and an exceptionally attractive one at that - being the heroine. <br/><br/>As a male in my 50s, and one who grew up with hundreds of comic books - Wonder Woman, Superman, Batman, etc - this movie is far closer to my idea of how WW should be treated that certainly the 80s eye-candy that was the TV show. I mean, what do you boys want?! <br/><br/>Aside from the odd movie like ""Kill Bill"" and ""Lara Croft"", I can't think of many others where a woman gets to play the hero centre-stage. Yes, there are many flaws with the movie - if you want to nit-pick every single stupid little thing - and guess what? This applies to practically every movie out there. But the fight sequences alone - the choreography and the fact that you can actually see the action (not close-in shots to mask the inadequacy of the actors/directors) - make the movie well worth it.<br/><br/>The boys that rate this movie negatively would probably have been far happier with a male director (instead of female), one who perhaps wouldn't have given Gal Gadot as much breadth to threaten the male-dominated super-hero world. <br/><br/>This movie is a breath of fresh air in an increasingly confusing and overdone series of super-hero universes. I would love to see a version with a script written by a woman.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie yet, and as with any movie anyway, ignore the negative criticism and make your own mind up. I have four daughters and they loved (most of) this movie, and actually found it inspirational. These days, and in this world, anything that inspires my girls gets my nod. Good job, Gal."
"davispittman","8","6","11","2 September 2017"," Very entertaining Marvel film
","Wonder Woman finally has a feature film in the DC universe. And it's Gal Gadot playing the infamous bad ass hero. I really loved her as Wonder Woman, she plays the character not only with a tough heroic persona, but also with a very strong sense of heart and morality. She brings depth and empathy to the role, which is of course very much needed. Chris Pine stars alongside Gadot, and I can't think of a better actor to play Pine's character. He is the love interest of Wonder Woman, a soldier she meets at the beginning. He is of course an extremely good looking man, but he brings more than just a rugged handsome face to the role, he also brings emotion and depth and his chemistry with Gadot is very believable and the audience is automatically pulled into their story. Their connection really en-chances the movie overall. Diana (Wonder Woman) and her personal growth in the movie is also a big part of the plot. We see her grow and discover things about herself and the world, we see her connection with Pine and where that goes, and then of course we get to see a lot of cool action sequences, especially towards the end when the true enemy is revealed. I give Wonder Woman an 8/10 overall, pretty entertaining well made superhero flick."
"MarcusViniciusBSiqueira","9","6","11","11 June 2017"," Pretty much great movie!
","First of all, no Spoilers. For me, what made it a great movie is the history inside it, the whole of it and the acting. I really liked the Gal Gadot and her acting. The move takes a lot of opportunities to strike down at our old societies traditions that use to put a Woman in a place she doesn't belong. The movie, and Wonder Woman, put Woman in the same place as man, making them equal to fight, equal to living, equal to beliefs. The effects are good, the movie followed the same effect style of the Batman vs Superman. To clarify about my rating, 9 out of 10, I did not give it 10 because the there could be more action and better ones, but don't get me wrong, it is a nice movie and it has action!"
"Verdugo85","8","6","11","6 June 2017"," Finally a good DCEU film!!
","You know..<br/><br/>As a comic book fan, The DCEU films has been very disappointing with Man Of Steel, Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad. And now we have a game-changer: Wonder Woman!!<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is the 4th DCEU film and first live action feature film. Wonder Woman delivers good origin story, decent action (no over the top CGI destruction porn), good fight scenes, funny moment, nice romantic moments between Diana & Steve Trevor (Chris Pine).<br/><br/>I was concern with this film back then because of the DCEU's poor reputation and Gal Gadot as an actress to pull off Wonder Woman in her own film BUT she and the movie proved me wrong. She impressed me as Wonder Woman, she embodied the character much like how Christopher Reeve embodied Superman, good job Gal. Im not a fan of Wonder Woman but I know some things about her and pretty much this film captures the essence of the character and story, I believe its based on the new 52 series. Im glad that Wonder Woman was finally given the chance to shine (giving a break to the usual Batman/Superman) and deservedly praised. WB needs to keep on shining the rest of the DC superheroes.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Chris Pine as Steve Trevor: Cool, bold, courageous, funny, passionate and determined, Chris Pine nailed it. Him and Gal had chemistry. I'd love to see him again!<br/><br/>I don't want to say much but Wonder Woman is worth watching. Its one of the best superhero films in the same sense as Superman 1978, Batman Begins, Iron Man, Captain America: The First Avenger and Spider-Man (2002)."
"heatherclark-94123","9","8","16","8 October 2017"," Wonder Woman's Hero's Journey - Not Just a Superhero Flick
","I'm an educator. I enjoy many types of movies, from the silly to the serious. I wasn't expecting much from Wonder Woman, but I was pleasantly surprised. Then, I decided to look at reviews by regular people, rather than professional critics. Many of the reviews I saw were negative. There were complaints such as ""she claims to be a pacifist yet she kills people,"" or ""this movie only made money because it was a superhero movie."" How sad. <br/><br/>First of all, those negative reviews I read missed the point of the film. There were so many subtle nuances! At first, all she wants to do is destroy Ares and bring peace to the ""world of man."" This is not necessarily the same thing as being a pacifist; rather, she is a guardian. She starts her Hero's Journey as a neophyte, not knowing what dangers are in the world, and not understanding the complexities of human nature. <br/><br/>As the story (and her journey) progresses, her point of view morphs. Perhaps things are not so simple. She must take a stand for the good guys, right? After all, there is good and bad, and never the twain shall meet, right?<br/><br/>Again and again, she is faced with people and situations that challenge her way of thinking. I see this as her first experience with the real world. Most of us encounter this when we leave home and try to make something of ourselves in the real world. <br/><br/>I was struck by something else that happens at the same time. Far from ""wilting"" or ""weakening"" as some negative reviewers claimed, I believe she grew stronger. She discovered her strength. There were things she did part way through the story that she never would have thought possible as she first left the island. <br/><br/>Then the final blow to her naivete: she discovers there are no perfect people in the world of man. People are far more complex than that. Yes, at first it blows her mind, but ultimately, it also makes her stronger.<br/><br/>In the final moments of the film, yes, it becomes the typical cgi show; however, she is tested. Ares plays on her confusion and tries to convince her to join him. At last, the pieces click. At last, she fully knows who she is, what she must do, and why. Only then is she able to destroy Aries. <br/><br/>At the end, we see her years after her hero's journey. She is NOT in hiding, as some suggest. If you pay attention, she is working with Wayne Enterprises. Sound familiar? Yeah, that's Batman.<br/><br/>After all this, when I try to tell family and friends about the film, I wait until the last moment to tell them the title of the film. Is it really a superhero film? I suppose. I see it as a woman on the archetypal Hero's Journey. All the pieces are there - you just have to look."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","8","16","4 June 2017"," Wondrous
","When Steve Trevor(Pine, charming, wry) lands on Themyscira, it is the first contact between it and the world of man(the species) in a long time, and the first experienced at all by Diana(Gadot, bringing to life the idealistic titular character. Her smile, her grace and her world are all stunning. Their chemistry is strong). He tells the ethnically diverse group about World War I. Might Ares have returned, creating the conflict he lives for?<br/><br/>There are chunks of this that pass without action. Especially in the middle section. The climax is less chaotic, loud and, well, blinding, than Batman V Superman's, albeit not entirely dodging those problems. And the first few aren't as consequential. The initial one is essentially combat training. However, when it's there, it is always good, and frequently amazing. It's not there purely because that's part of why we came to watch. Never does it just make people look cool, and let the heroine stack up a body-count. Heck, she barely kills anyone, and she clearly isn't interested in it. In one of the (too) many similarities to Captain America: The First Avenger(a movie it does largely match in overall quality. Nevertheless, it feels derivative), she ""doesn't like bullies"". No, first and foremost, she's doing it to save people.<br/><br/>This as the leaders of the countries involved are shrugging off massive casualties. As No Man's Land is treated as an unfortunate reality, not one that is likely to be brought to an end. While the two villains, who could easily have been combined into one, spend their compelling screen-time either using horrible poison gas on the defenseless, or studying hard to make it even worse. She's there to rescue those she's never met. From a race she hadn't even encountered days earlier, in her whole life. We're in the middle of a comic book movie boom. And yet this seemingly obvious value and goal so often goes forgotten these days.<br/><br/>Other than the leads, a lot of the performers, talented as most of them are, get lost in the shuffle, with only a couple of moments to really shine. The Amazons are almost all bad actors – I figure they went for physical types, instead. I would say it could have been handled by hiring talents specifically for when they have dialog, and then those would be ones we didn't see in other scenes. Mostly, they are there to convince you of Paradise Island as somewhere people live, work, not only fence. And they succeed. There are pacing issues. The ending is bad, and borrows from great, but mismatched, sources. Occasionally, the message and themes get cheesy, and the final resolution is one example. Although the humor is rapid-fire, using the fish-out-of-water element well, it frequently feels forced, and I don't blame those who find it obnoxious and, indeed, at no point actually funny. The DCEU(no, saying that this is the best of the four isn't saying much) has yet to balance jokes with seriousness. It's not a perfect film. What it is, is genuinely engaging and moving. Warner Brothers? Keep Patty Jenkins around. She'll help you properly compete with the MCU.<br/><br/>There is a lot of disturbing content in this. I recommend it to everyone. 7/10"

"aharmas","10","15","35","2 June 2017"," Grace, Intelligence, and Strength... What's Not to Love?
","I'm in love with Gal Gadot because she's gorgeous, has an amazing presence, captivating us with her ability to look like a bigger than life figure, retaining enough warmth and heart to get you misty eyed. After so many heroes with some sort of trauma in their backgrounds, and an overload of sensory stimulation that passes as entertaining for many in the audience, I'm glad the pyrotechnics are toned down, except for a climax that I supposed had to be there. We get some characterization that has rarely been seen, with a few exceptions, and the writer keeps things moving so well that it's hard to believe we sat through 141 minutes.<br/><br/>The story focuses on Diana, Wonder Woman, a special creation of Zeus who is not aware of her role in the universe, but who knows she must somehow help the human race survive and get better. There's, of course, a villain that is as powerful as she is, and this one is clear about what he is supposed to do, and if you pay enough attention, I'm sure you can figure what figure he's standing for. It's an interesting inclusion in this type of movies, but then again, we're giving a nice first act that takes us back to some exciting mythological background, with a film that treats the Amazons, and women in general as full human beings, valuing both their physical traits, their spiritual core, and their intelligence. Diana might be naive about a lot of what goes in the world outside her area, but she's strong, adaptable, and willing to learn without sacrificing her faith on what she believes in.<br/><br/>With the support of Chris Pine, she manages to learn about what humanity has done, is doing, and is capable of doing. The question is what she is willing to accomplish or whether her role needs to be redefined. It's a bit heavy at times, but it's kept simple enough to let us enjoy the story and the movie, and having such a capable actress makes the experience remarkable.<br/><br/>There were times that I was laughing at the innocence and joy Gadot gives her character when she enjoys the simple experiences of life. She has a wonderful laugh and light that shines brightly when she sees something that is precious for many. She is also great about portraying the dark times, the disappointing and the pain of losing something that she treasures.<br/><br/>Let's not forget the very cool emphasis on her powers, her tools, and the way the director (who happens to be lady). She's graceful while she fights, but she's no weakling. There's are shots that remind us she's of royal origins, connection to Gods, and she's still somehow a very powerful human being. She can get hurt, but she's also really good making sure she protects herself and battles her enemies.<br/><br/>There are ""quiet"" moments, and Gadot is superb in those, too. Her entrance in the gala is a stunner. Jaws will drop at the way she carries herself. We see also how beautiful and expressive her close ups are when she realizes there's something going on with army friend. She's a hero, a leader, a soldier, a lover, a friend, and a goddess both from her mythological origins to her moment in the silver screen."

","Patty Jenkins learns that Pimpin, the eminent connoisseur of movies and a man with the most impeccable taste in the world hated Wonder Woman. She decides to write an apology letter to the great man.<br/><br/>Dear Pimpin, <br/><br/>I agree with your analysis that Wonder Woman is nothing but horse manure. Frankly, I just went with what the studio told me to do and the pro-feminist American media and stupid super hero/heroine movie fans across the world did the rest for me. Wonder Woman is another nail in the coffin for what used to be America's greatest contribution to the world - cinema.<br/><br/>I know you think that the film is a waste of great acting talent. What were great actors like David Thewlis, Ewen Bremmer, Saïd Taghmaoui and Lucy Davis doing, phoning it in and making a fool of themselves? That was what I was thinking while I watched them on the sets. Like me, they were also in it for the money. I guess.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot might well be the synonym for the word unremarkable. I don't know why the studio selected her. It is still a mystery to me. I heard that you were cringing in your seat looking at her aesthetically displeasing facial expressions or lack of them. Imagine my plight on the sets. At least I was getting paid for it. Hohoho! <br/><br/>Wonder Woman's cloying humanitarianism made you want to punch her in the face. Her sexual innocence grated on your nerves. These are all emotions that would be experienced by anyone with even an iota of intelligence.<br/><br/>For a film that had so many beautiful scantily clad women, there was not a single sex scene. This is quite pathetic when you compare the film to a fantasy classic like CONAN THE BARBARIAN that underscored the eroticism and sexual drive of female warriors. But Wonder Woman is aimed at teenagers and we were not sure how they would take it. I know it makes no sense when you consider that almost every aspect of American culture is intensely sexualised these days.<br/><br/>I agree that the the mediocre, over the top, overlong and shoddy action scenes was what made the film genuinely tough to watch. Even I long for the old school hands on action scenes in BENHUR or QUO VADIS. But the majority seemed to like the special effects crap that Hollywood dishes out today so .....<br/><br/>I know you wished that you had a beer while watching this film. But you should take that up with the Indian government. I recommend that they make alcohol available at all cineplexes so that people with taste do not go crazy and shoot up the audience or something.<br/><br/>I am afraid I will be directing Part 2 of the Wonder Woman franchise. I know you are angry that so much money and resources are used up to manufacture a banal product like Wonder Woman. But I do not see things changing in future. I suggest that you have a few drinks before watching Justice League Part 2, Suicide Squad Part 2, X Men Redux, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and The Avengers 4. Or even better, stay home.<br/><br/>There isn't much that you or I can do except vote the film a 1 on IMDb. But even that would not make much of a difference, for the morons outnumber people like you.<br/><br/>Best Regards, <br/><br/>Patty Jenkins"

"scott-sw","8","38","105","7 June 2017"," A Good DC Movie
","Not since 2012's Dark Knight Rises has the DC cinematic universe shined like this with Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot stars as the iconic character of Diana, the Amazonian who fought for justice throughout the ages of comics. In this modern re- telling, the Amazonians are immortal women who reside on a secret island, hidden from the world. Born of the Greek Gods, they have Herculean qualities in combat, strength, and character. Eventually, they are accidentally discovered by soldiers fighting in World War I - the War to end all Wars. After a skirmish battle, we find Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) as the lone American who is helping the British cause against the Germans. At the same time, a sinister German known as Ludendorff (Danny Hutson), and his sadistic cohort of chemical warfare, Dr. Maru (Elana Anaya). They have a new chemical gas agent that can really turn the stalemate in World War I. As Diana thrusts herself into this war to stop it, she automatically thinks the Greek God, Ares is behind it. He is the God of War. If he is stopped, it would bring the war to an end. As she learns of the plot, she knows that Ludendorff must be him. Diana, though, is not only naive about the outside world but also impatient with the politics behind waging war. She always wants to do the right thing, and it has to be now. Steve has to temper her, and teach her the ways of how the world works. There are a few faults with the movie. The first being the run time of 2 hours and 40 minutes. That is a long run time that may leave the kids squirming in their seats. Also, Steve Trevor's secretary, Etta Candy (Lucy Davis) is wasted for a few measly minutes for brief comedy as opposed to being a full fleshed out character. Also, as Diane adjusts to British Society, especially the fashion, she is a fish out of water (or should I save that for an Aquaman review?). Some of the comedy misfires. However, making up for these errors are the way Wonder Woman conflicts with British Society. She thinks Etta is a slave since she ""has to do what Steve tells her."" Diana is shocked that women are looked at with disdain and as many British officials disregard her and consider her an intrusion into ""men's work."" For the record, women had no vote in the United Kingdom until after the close of WWI. Fortunately, one of my high praises is the message of feminism does not exceed to male bashing as did last summer's ""Ghostbusters"" reboot. Instead, Diana works as a team member with other men under Steve's command. She earns respect, and gives it to the men around her. There is also a good melding of the use of time element, which is reminiscent of Captain America, The First Avenger. Wonder Woman, though, is pulled off much better. Probably the best thing is the characters and actors. Finally, we care about DC characters. Gal Gadot finally gives us a comic hero we can identify with, something lacking in Man of Steel. She is not larger than life, and brings a sincerity to the role. Chris Pine, who often relies on charm, gives us a character we can identify with as the hero who wants to do the right thing, and must come to terms with a strong female presence in his life. This is also a bright movie, unlike most DC outings. Man of Steel had much introspection and brooding. Batman v. Superman was incredibly dark as the two big ones battled for supremacy. Even Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy was a bit bleak. Green Lantern was just plain silly. So see Wonder Woman. See it again. And maybe a third time.

"Mike_Devine","9","12","27","4 July 2017"," DC meets expectations on 'Wonder Woman'
","The DC Comics universe is finally on an upswing after being repeatedly outdone by its Disney/Marvel Studios rival for years, with 'Wonder Woman' being the latest effort that has found an audience.<br/><br/>Now the highest-grossing film directed by a female director (Patty Jenkins), 'Wonder Woman' is a powerhouse that is more a war film than it is a superhero one. After having been introduced to Gal Gadot's Diana Prince in 2016's 'Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice,' we get to see the Amazonian woman's origin story, from her upbringing on a secluded Mediterranean island to her direct impact on fighting the ""world to end all wars."" After rescuing a downed American spy (Chris Pine) and fighting off a wave of Germans, we get to see Gadot's character go through many experiences that change her life in a short period of time. As she's bent on defeating the god Ares, who she is convinced is behind the death and destruction ravaging the globe, Diana discovers her godlike powers and realizes how unique she really is.<br/><br/>While Gadot is clearly the main attraction in 'Wonder Woman,' there are some strong supporting performances by the likes of Robin Wright (Antiope), Connie Nielsen (Hippolyta) and David Thewlis (Sir Patrick). Sure - there is something to be said about the inconsistent accents, but these are not as distracting as they could have been. Again, perhaps 'Wonder Woman's best attribute is that it is not over-the-top and is first and foremost an action-drama set in WWI-era Europe. Despite the serious backdrop, there's plenty of laughs to go around, as well, most of which revolve around Diana's unfamiliarity with the modern world.<br/><br/>But everything about 'Wonder Woman,' from the way it was filmed to the special effects, is first-rate when compared with other films in the genre. There were plenty of critiques and high expectations to go around before its release, whether deserved or not, and it's good to see 'Wonder Woman' really lived up to the hype.<br/><br/>If it had been poorly received, this could have been the nail in the coffin for the current DC Comics film series, but it appears 'Wonder Woman' was just the jolt that was needed."

"jon.h.ochiai","10","13","30","4 June 2017"," Only love can save the world...
","Love creates the hero in awesome ""Wonder Woman"". In the touching moment of the climactic battle Gal Gadot's Diana sources power from her memories of those she loves, and those who love her. Her bold strong Aunt Antiope played by Robin Wright, who taught her to be the fiercest Amazon Warrior, implores her, ""You are stronger than this!"" Upon leaving her home to save the world her Mother Hippolyta, played by sublime Connie Nielsen, hugs Diana, ""You have been my greatest love. Today, you are my greatest sorrow"" Steve played by Chris Pine, who loves Diana, says, ""I can save the day. You can save the world."" <br/><br/>Greatness emerges out of those who love and believe in you. In Director Patty Jenkins and Screenwriter Allan Heinberg's ""Wonder Woman"" hero emerges as bravery for those you love and believe in. For Jenkins and Heinberg, love creates Hero. Gal Gadot is a star. She is stunningly beautiful. She amazes with her physical gifts and martial arts skills in battle. She eloquently captures the innocence of the child, who believes in her heart that good will always conquer evil, although the world can be gray—neither light or dark. The hero is in Gadot's gaze, her words, and her calm stillness. As Diana, she inspires us to use our powers for good. ""Wonder Woman"" too is inspired. A great movie. <br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" is the origins story of Diana, who becomes the superhero of the comic book, reset in World War I. The movie bogs down some in the middle as the narrative shifts focus to the War with Germany. The deadly gas weapon of mass destruction created by disfigured Dr. Maru, played by mysterious Elena Anaya, is coveted by General Ludendorff, malevolently played by Danny Huston. Yet, the hero story truly mesmerizes. <br/><br/>Jenkins brilliantly creates homage to Greek Mythology as Amazon Queen Hippolyta (Nielsen) narrates the fable. God Zeus created Mankind on earth. Zeus loved Man as his own children. Outraged with jealousy his son Ares, God of War, gave Man fear, anger, and war. To save Man, Zeus created the Amazon women warriors. The Amazon live and train on the island of Themyscira, shrouded from the rest of civilization and Ares himself. Matthew Jensen's cinematography captures the life and light of idyllic Themyscira. The land possesses the beauty and strength of the women, who reside there. <br/><br/>Hippolyta and her sister Antiope (Wright) battle over young Diana's destiny. Diana's benevolent Mother Hippolyta wishes to spare her daughter of the warrior's sacrifice, her own past. Aunt Antiope knows Diana is the chosen one, and secretly trains her niece. Hippolyta refuses to reveal to Diana her secret destiny, instead having Antiope train Diana as the Amazon's fiercest warrior. The grown Diana (Gadot) becomes the valiant idealist and protector, fulfilling that part of her destiny. Also the bracelets she wears in battle reveal invincible power. <br/><br/>The War shapes Diana's destiny. British Captain Steve Trevor, played by charismatic Chris Pine, crashes his plane in the waters off Themyscira. He has the plans for the deadly German nerve gas. Diana saves his life. However, the Germans pursue Steve as well. The Amazons along with Steve defeat the German soldiers, but with tragic loss. <br/><br/>Realizing the world is in peril with ""the war to end all wars"", Diana disobeys her Mother's wishes, and sails with Steve back to London. Diana believes that to save Mankind she must slay Ares, God of War. Steve is sympathetic to idealist Diana; he only wants the War to end. Knowing Diana's destiny, her Mother lets her go. Diana takes along with her on the journey, the Amazon shield, and the sacred ""God Killer"" sword to defeat Ares. <br/><br/>Gadot commands ""Wonder Woman"" and is the bright new star. She is amazing in all the screen battles. Her brave idealism and soul truly inspires. She tells British leader Sir Patrick, played by Danny Thewlis, ""You should be ashamed!""—that his generals don't fight with their men on the battlefield. The hero arises from those who love her. Nielsen, Wright, and Pine are amazing. Nielsen is touching as Hippolyta the stoic Mother, who loves Diana with all her heart. Wright is ruthless compassion as the warrior, who sees the greatness within her. Pine is surprisingly poignant as the man, who loves Diana, giving her purpose. <br/><br/>With Jenkins and Gadot, hero is about love. Hero always is. Perhaps, ""Wonder Woman"" can inspire other movie heroes to declare the same. Now that would be the grand legacy of ""Wonder Woman""."

","Expecting a run-of-the-mill superhero film, I could have not been more wrong! This film delivers something that none in it's genre has had the ability to do; Never before have I seen a film with such stature convey such powerful messages. <br/><br/>Whilst this film will be(for most) an awesome gut punching tale full of action and quips on the surface. Beneath it manages to convey a poignant reminder of the increasingly terrifying destructive nature of mankind. Although this is a very morbid subject to dwell on, and one which does in fact carried reasonably consistently throughout, this film does very well to dispel and override that with glimmers of hope, love, compassion and happiness. Thus serving as a virile reminder that hope and faith will emerge when even the darkest clouds form. Above all - love never falters at the hands of evil.<br/><br/>This film is a true work of art and although it borrows clichés from a lot of other films of it's genre, this film will not disappoint not matter what you're watching for."

So all and all you should see it and decide for yourself. I think you will be impressed."
"Ed-Shullivan","7","9","19","23 September 2017"," I enjoyed the cinematography, story line and of course Gail Gadot as Wonder Woman
","I think the producers are at least 28 years late in finally introducing a female lead as their heroine who would be capable of carrying a huge blockbuster action/adventure film by herself. No disrespect to male co star Chris Pine who plays Steve Trevor who himself is trying to save the world from destruction by the Germans, but Gal Gadot kicks butt and brings to her audience a believable female action heroine who certainly shows by her actions that she does not need a man by her side to save her in distress.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the cinematography, as well as the musical score which had great synchronization with the non stop action displayed on the screen. The colour throughout the film was dynamic and crisp and I would put my money down that if Gal Gadot had not been just four (4) years old when Michael Keaton was first presented on the big screen as the Batman back in 1989, we would have in fact had a female action heroine winning over Batman at the box office back in 1989.<br/><br/>Congratulations to the women's movement and to all those pre-teens who will try and emulate Diana the Wonder Woman as they grow into adulthood. The day will come maybe in my lifetime when the next Mixed Martial Arts Champion such as Conor McGregor or boxing champion such as Floyd Mayweather when asked who their idol was growing up and their response is Wonder Woman. There will come a time when women will become equal to men in almost every way, including as heroes to emulate, and boys will emulate strong film characters as Wonder Woman. The proof will come when women get paid equal or better than men in Hollywood based on their box office draw and not by their sex.<br/><br/>I am a proud man and I congratulate Wonder Woman for the strong message it sends to all its audience. My only dislike was there was a bit too much CGI (Computer-generated imagery) during some of the extended action scenes which should have been edited down. Sometimes too much...is simply too much (CGI). I give the film a sound 7 out of 10 rating."

","Finally a great super heroine movie which is a compliment to all great (and normal) women. Probably it helps that astonishing Gal Gadot is that super heroine. I was very pleasantly surprised about easy start and fairy tail like beginning. The whole movie has this nice pace. Like Logan it has very nice playing time, more than 2h 10m which is enough to tell a story and present characters. The movie it self, the story frame and the whole story flow reminded me of a Captain America: First avenger (which I also like). I actually like the story and the story frame. There are some moments where main character could have looked stupid but it is nicely played. Again the movie leaves you with a feeling that there is a lots of things going on. When you look back there really are some things that are going on in the movie. What I especially like with this movie is a super villain. He was not a typical one and was far better thought. Actually he was much deeper in a way that other super villains and it made some sense. The problem with superhero movies as I see it is when the story is bigger than the universe and when main villain is bigger than time presented in the story. This was not at all the case in this movie. That's why Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 totally sucks and Wonder Woman surprisingly doesn't."
"audacity10","1","9","19","14 August 2017"," A continuation in the decline of the Hollywood action movie
","Wonder Woman alongside the equally dreary Spider-man: Homecoming hit the cinemas this year with suspiciously faultless reviews from every corner of the internet and the press. So fierce was the campaign of positivity, you'd never have realised both movies are actually really pretty garbage.<br/><br/>I can only figure that the dreadful response to the awful feminist Ghost Busters remake taught Hollywood that they must get the hop on the inevitable negative backlash and so flooded the internet with fake reviews before the real reviews start coming out - which appears to be the case now, with a plummet in Wonder Woman's public approval rating lately.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman truly is a mess of a movie. It spends no time developing 'Diana's' character; all she's interested in is ""peace"", while hacking men to pieces. And of course the villain was going to be the ""Nazis"" again. And of course there's NO coincidence our protagonist happens to be Israeli. <br/><br/>I was exhausted by the end of this movie, such is the constant drumming of the globalist message and glorification of warfare. My face must have looked like a sweaty puffed-up Chris Pine due to the lack of activity reaching my brain."
"alex-klein2424","9","9","19","13 June 2017"," Wonderful Woman
","Let me get this out of the way because as you all know I am a Marvel boy. I want nothing more than to see Marvel movies and watch DC crash and burn as they make poor attempts at creating a film universe mirroring Marvel's very successful one. So far, my wish has been granted. While I really liked Man of Steel, the rest were nothing to write home about. But now that I have seen Wonder Woman I am compelled to buy as much paper and pen as possible to write home to all my family and friends that DC did something fantastic.<br/><br/>It speaks volumes what the difference in direction, action, villains, and actors will do. Gal Gadot, while no Oscar winner (yet), does an amazing job as the titular character. Surprisingly all the supporting cast also is great. Everyone has moments to shine, though Diana of Themyscira shines so very bright. Party Jenkins as the director was a fantastic choice as well, it's been a while since she's seen the light but as I stated. Everyone shines in this movie.<br/><br/>The previous movies in the world, Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad felt like footnotes to this movie. So much needless action and terrible writing along with wasted characters and motives that didn't make sense made this movies trash. It was even the talk of the town that critics were being paid to give bad reviews because they weren't Marvel movies but to all those psychos who couldn't wrap their head around the fact that they were just bad movies can now shut up for good. I am not the only critic who loves this movie. Last I checked it was at a 95 or above on rotten tomatoes and even high on Metacritic. I'm not a fan of rotten tomatoes but it says something that it's one of the highest rated movies. It's a big sign for DC and for super hero movies in general. Make them more like Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>I don't even want to go into what the movie is about because you need to go see it. It had amazing action scenes, tender and sad emotional scenes, and some laughs along the way. But we have now reached the stage of this review where I point out something that maybe could be a spoiler so I will say it as vaguely as possible. Basically there is a scene at an undisclosed part of the movie that is in a way identical to a Marvel movie. I'm not saying they copied it, but I'd like tot think it was an homage. If you notice it too, let me know or just ask me and I'll tell you but it's something that cannot be ignored. Obviously Marvel is king, but Wonder Woman is now queen and honestly I'm OK with that.<br/><br/>During the film I thought to myself multiple times that I will train my future daughter to be like Wonder Woman and I was so happy that young girls world wide will have an awesome role model to look up to. She does a great job being a powerful figure that can inspire girls and women and, hell, men too!<br/><br/>Take anyone to this movie. Take your daughter, take your sister, take your friends and family. Make this the date movie to save your marriage. Wonder Woman is truly wonderful, and she can kick my ass any day of the week."

"easlayton","10","14","33","2 June 2017"," A Movement disguised as film.
","Wonder Woman. Light spoilers ahead. I had to think about this but I wanted to talk about the experience we had at the theater last night and I think I'm finally able to put into words the feelings that were running rampant in my mind as I watched the movie and afterwards as I talked with Shawna. One of the best things about last night, other than the fact that I got to see one of the best super hero movies out there with my wife, was that the crowd watching the movie was amazing. Prior to the film starting there was a very strong sense of occasion. There was excitement in the air. People were up & walking about, not content with just sitting to wait for the movie to start. They were talking with neighboring movie-goers, laughing, getting drinks & food, wide-eyed and ready but all of them were in good spirits. It was like the best unorganized mutual party you could fathom. The crowd cheered and clapped and hooted and hollered. Especially when Diana made very strong metaphorical references to the cowardice of men in positions of power in the New World. We were all silent when the mood was somber. We all laughed together and with the characters on the screen when the time was right. What I can surmise is this; we ALL became involved in a movement that was titled Wonder Woman. I could feel that in that theater. We could all feel it. Every one of us. It was tangible and it was real. I felt it strongest as the movie unfolded before me and for the first 40 minutes of the movie, I could not stop wiping my eyes. Not because the movie was sad but because of the very real truths Diana and this film brought to us. Not just what her character was saying on screen but what this movie being in theaters world wide means to people every where. If there was a negative thought in my mind last night it was simply to wonder why this film had not been released a decade ago. But then I think, maybe the timing is right. Maybe this is a boost we all need to do the right thing. To be better than the sum of our parts. To carry the weight that others are unable or too weak to carry. When Diana tells Steve Trevor and his men ""But it's what I'm going to do."" as she launches herself into the bloody battlefield to bring peace and safety to the poor and downtrodden, I don't know if there was a dry eye in the theater. Because this is what we need. This is what we should be doing. Standing up for those who are weaker, smaller, lost, confused and war torn. Wonder Woman told us to stand. And the theater stood. As we all should. Thank you Gal Gadot. Thank you Patty Jenkins. Thank you Allan Heinberg. Thank you for bringing the heart of what a super hero is to the people of the world."
"kuarinofu","5","14","33","1 June 2017"," A romantic comedy for girls with a WW1 theme as understood by 10 y.o.
","First of all, this movie is going to be marketed as a ""symbol of gender equality"" (trying to do the same trick the new Ghostbusters did) and I'm sure it will succeed. Those guys from marketing really know their tricks nowadays, it is easy to cash in by creating an artificial conflict. This is interesting since this movie disrespects women. Same it does for men. <br/><br/>Up to the first 90 minutes the movie follows the same scheme: a man sees WW, tells her she's hot, she reacts to everything like a baby, most of her dialogue is incomprehensible screaming, then she exchanges a couple of corky lines with Steve on how inexperienced she is in terms of men and women relationships. And there's also some sort of a plot.<br/><br/>Every character in this is a comic relief (exept for WW and Steve), I can't tell if those characters come directly from the comic books, but they felt completely unfunny and unnecessary. It really felt more like an attempt to represent all racial groups, but the movie mocks them as well, making them look like complete retards. The gas lady and Ludendorff were ripped straight out of a children's cartoon. Sir Patricks was obvious at being a main villain yet his looks really did fool me by just how bizarre he was.<br/><br/>Not WW's plan, nor the villain's plan is comprehensible. Steve has stolen the book from the gas lady, which as it turns she and he didn't need at all. Her and Ludendorff wanted to create a gas that pretty much does the same thing that any gas of that era but burns gas masks as a bonus. They wanted to do this for reasons unknown, since the war was over and nothing could've changed that. For some reason she thought that her death gas was a bigger weapon THAN A GAS THAT MAKES YOU SUPERHUMAN. WW's motivation was unclear as well, at first she wanted to kill Ludendorf since she assumed that he is Ares. Then she completely dumped that idea and went shopping and being socially awkward. By the end of the movie, when Ludendorf and gas lady are trying to board a bomber full of EXPLODING gas ASSUMING it will for some reason reach London DURING A WAR while WW is fighting her brother (big shocker) while he is saying really stupid things you can ever hear from a Greek god. After a Batman v Superman fight scene and OBLIGATORY Jesus symbolism with Twelve Apostles (being randomly friendly soldiers from different factions) we get the message that she ended all wars with love, or by a bolt of lightning into her brother, whatever. It was funny to see that symbolism since Gal Gadot is obviously Jewish.<br/><br/>At first I hated this movie, then I was wishing for it to end quicker, by the end it sort of redeemed some of the flaws but it was so ungodly stupid and disrespectful that I would never recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>The worst: the plot, the characters, a ton of romantic talk scenes + trying on clothes scenes, the villain, the humour.<br/><br/>The best: Gal Gadot is beautiful and she's in great shape, ~ 10 mins of great action (without lightning bolts and fire), beautiful and memorable soundtrack (yet it was cut down very fast for some reason)."

The fact that every single person she is up against seem to be a moron does not to much to maker her more credible as an action-hero. The scene where she is rushing soldiers in a bikini is laughable. The storm-trooper aim that only hit her shield and nothing at her unprotected body is bizarre, and enough to just turn you off the whole film.

","Wonder Woman is a film that means to improve society and bring Hope to diversity! It awakes audiences to realizing both gender inequality and racial inequality under- representation such as handsome-Chinese men with our white actresses are long overdue romantic plots. There are so much territory to explore and to improve and to not hinder our domestic actresses and actors' diversity development. The bell strikes for more diversity and it is great!<br/><br/>It is really interesting to see this movie and then hear how some say the same lines, and repeating that it somehow copies Captain America 1 and tries to say it's worse by relating it to Thor 2. Take that by a grain of salt as it is not too hard to make multiple similar reviews. I think from the standout performance of Wonder Woman from Batman V Superman, it showed how good her solo film could be. It certainly was proved in this film. There will certainly be moments where the gender dominance be challenged but only by those super edgy, and to be a real man requires the humbleness to accept balance, and respect the others. I am excited about this film, I hope it get's fair reviews and critical opinions, not ones that are just cheerleaders to the Marvel universe and secretly hoping it doesn't get competitors. Who knows how much money is spent by a studio to sway the initial reviews. Movies reviews should be just about the movies. This film looks good! I care fairness of the reviews equally. To be fair, Thor 2 was okay, similar to Man of Steel, and Wonder Woman has a heart on top the action. Regarding feminism and patriarchal system, each should respect the other without either overcompensating and off-setting the balance. <br/><br/>The phase Hollywood have to and needs to improve on, is getting handsome Chinese man a powerful lead protagonist in a movie to suitably make Hollywood unbiased diverse. It is unfortunate that there are probably many studios fearing to give hot Chinese man a central character and integrating them into the supposedly diverse interracial circle of Hollywood. It is surprising that Hollywood is not willing to media any sort of romantic drama between Chinese man and our competent white female actresses. It is an insult to us, and to the large white female actresses population, to be barred from further developing culturally and professionally with diversity. After all we're all humans. Wonder Woman is a good long over- due slate to mitigating the big internal cultural barrier established for poor nefarious reasons by studios own by Hollywood and connected to politics. Let Wonder Woman bring hope to this issue. The film has a great sense of Hope endowed in it."

"Niorra","9","10","22","9 August 2017"," Refreshing for DC
","I just finished watching Wonder Woman and immediately jumped to read the reviews. I didn't go into the movie with many expectations because I'm not as familiar with the lineage of WW as I am with many of the other big DC heroes.<br/><br/>I have to say this movie was refreshing. Everything about the movie was great. It didn't jump around like most origin stories and it didn't linger. It times everything perfectly. I was emotionally invested in the story the whole way through. <br/><br/>Gal Gadot was empowering and transparent in her role. What's unique about this story is it doesn't play as a shoot em up bang bang movie. WW is from a sheltered world and you go on a journey with her discovering essentially the human experience of good vs evil. I liked this because it connects her to us more so than any other super heroes. Her nativity and innocence allows the viewer to put themselves in her shoes or better yet see through fresh eyes.<br/><br/>They did not over sexualize her character which was incredible. The sexist tones were subtle and played well with the period the film is set in. She isn't a warrior for women she is a warrior for justice, love, and peace. <br/><br/>The chemistry between her and Chris Pine was remarkable as well. I could really feel there connection. It didn't seem forced and there wasn't any power struggle. They played as equals. <br/><br/>The villainy in the film is well done. I won't go into any spoilers but the villainy served to elevate her character development more than playing equal parts for screen time.<br/><br/>The only thing I think most will dislike is it's definitely a film that's setting up the expanded universe in DC. I don't feel it left any room for a foreseeable sequel. Which may be a good thing, and it might leave them a blank slate to take her story in any direction. <br/><br/>Overall well done and this makes me so excited to see what's next for DC."

","I had been waiting on this film to come out for a while, and against my better judgment, I let myself have high expectations for it. And did it ever meet them! I love the fact that the entire movie never felt that it had to rush to tell the story. It built upon it's own foundation and took you to Diana's world and let you dwell there. Then it seemed every stage of the story effectively ran it's course on cue, not lingering too long and not jumping from scene to scene in whiplash fashion. It did well building emotion and keeping it gritty when necessary. What I was surprised about was it wasn't just for the girls. Steve Trevor wasn't there for eye candy, he did his part and pulled his weight. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and hope has been restored into the WB's DC franchise. Kudos Wonder Woman. Thank you for bringing the girls into the game."

I don't know where to start on praising such a brilliant film really so ill list a few key things that make it such a brilliant watch: a) I think they picked the best actress possible to play Wonder Woman as I think she depicts what it really means to be a god. b)I love the fact it was based in WW1 and c) The soundtrack is quite simply the best soundtrack I have ever heard for any superhero movie, I just cant get it out of my head!<br/><br/>If you are contemplating whether to go and see it, I urge you to stop contemplating and go see it, you will not regret it!"

","Really good!!!!!!<br/><br/>I really had no expectations going to the film due to the previous outings of the studio. After falling asleep in theater in batman vs superman, i thought of taking a pillow to theater but gal gadot and the story kept me at the edge of the seat all the time.<br/><br/>Even though the movie had more drama than action, it was completely well packed.The action scenes were sufficient and placed at the right time . The story gelled well with the message and gal gadot was a treat to watch ,although the guy played ares could have done better.the screenplay was simple yet powerful and the slowmotion's were massive (felt like i was watching an Indian movie!!!!).<br/><br/>So is it a perfect movie?definitely no,it had a few places were the audiences begged to finish the scene, a bit draggy, and the final fight was a clichéd one, were the protagonist fails and then rises to the occasion after something witnessing something inspiring and emotional. But overall it is definitely worth the money you pay!! Go Dceu!!!!"
"Jackbv123","10","10","22","2 June 2017"," Gal Gadot is worthy of the role
","Here we have an origin story that keeps us guessing as Dianna grows up. I had trouble understanding her mother's attitude - no, then yes, then no, etc, which was probably intended to heighten the mystery. And there are many hints here on the island that bear remembering later.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is captivating. She plays the new-to-the-outside-world role pretty well. But she really shines when Dianna has made up her mind and ready to act. I loved her look in London with the hat and glasses. And when she goes into action, she is one fierce lady. She is Wonder Woman. Even though so many of the action scenes were in the trailers, they still had impact when revealed on the big screen. And when she is on the screen, you just want to stare at her (face). (I say this as one not previously being at all attracted to Gadot.) Dianna is naïve, but not as much as you might expect - this is very well done. This movie is an excellent story of Dianna's journey to where she is in the present and explains what she said to Bruce Wayne at the end of the previous movie.<br/><br/>Chris Pine is pretty much his usual self although maybe a little more serious and mature, but he really took a distant second place to Gadot.<br/><br/>I was getting disappointed in the movie as it neared climax but then the whole thing changes and the climax is great and meaningful.<br/><br/>I have a complaint about the unnecessary sexual tension and innuendo. The scene with Chris Pine getting out of the bath is silly and cliché. Likewise the boat scene, although not quite so cliché."

"CriticalBunniez-666","9","7","14","20 July 2017"," A triumph for DC
","I was never really interested in DC movies, (except for Tim Burtons Batman), so I was skeptical about Wonder Woman. I was genuinely shocked at how good this movie was! The acting is good, it has good humor, the action is exciting, and the plot is really entertaining. Granted, it is no Guardians of The Galaxy, but it was still pretty awesome. Personally, I wished to see more mythology on the Greek gods and Princess Diana in this film, but the WWI parts are still interesting. The costumes were historically correct, and the music fit perfectly. Plus, the villains were pretty wicked. The film also had a great message about good and evil as well. I hope to see more Wonder Woman films in the future, and hopefully there will be more lore as well. I honestly can't see why there would be hate on this. Ah well, I guess a movie about a badass Amazon princess trying to stop World War I by killing a Greek god isn't for everyone. I recommend this movie to fans of superhero, war, and action movies. This title gets a thumbs up from CriticalBunniez 👍"

"EdECollins","6","11","25","6 June 2017"," Enjoyable but disappointing.
","SPOILER ALERT!<br/><br/>Saw Wonder Woman at the weekend... I will have to say that I was somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I loved the action, and Gal Gadot did a surprisingly excellent job (I say surprisingly only because I, naively thought that Wonder Woman should be played by someone bigger / more obviously strong). The choreography of all of the action scenes was really good. The whole first portion of the movie showing Wonder Woman's back story on the Amazonian island was excellent.<br/><br/>HOWEVER...<br/><br/>1. I think the title of the movie should be changed to ""CHRIS PINE!!! (featuring Wonder Woman)"". Chris Pine's character was largely unnecessary to the story-line and despite supposedly being a secondary character, he had as much screen time and more lines than Gal Gadot. Perhaps they thought that they really needed a well known star in the movie as they cast an unknown for Wonder Woman...?<br/><br/>2. Okay... We get it... She is a woman... It's 1918... Women weren't treated equally back then and certainly weren't involved in war councils and fighting... But did they REALLY need to keep on and on pointing out ""Oh my... What is a woman doing here?!""<br/><br/>3. In pretty much ever scene where Wonder Woman was with ""normal people"", there was someone mentioning how beautiful she is and the guys making unnecessary sexual remarks about her. Do we really need that validation of her beauty CONSTANTLY in the movie? In Superman or Batman or Spiderman movies there isn't a group of women every time the superhero is on screen saying how handsome he is... Wonder Woman is meant to be a bad ass warrior with super human strength and abilities. THAT is what is amazing about her... Not the fact that she is beautiful.<br/><br/>4. It felt like in EVERY fight scene, there was a slow mo clip to a part in the fight where Chris Pine ""saves"" Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>5. Really? A love story? It was totally unnecessary and just further enhanced Chris Pine's role while (in my mind) weakening Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>6. The Amazonian island was hidden for centuries and undiscoverable. It seems though that all it took was Chris Pine to show up and suddenly everyone can get through the magic barrier and get to the island... GO CHRIS PINE!<br/><br/>7. Apparently Chris Pine's character is meant to be British... But he makes no effort to have a British accent...??<br/><br/>8. The movie is getting all of these accolades for being so ""female led"" with a female director and a strong female lead... (It makes me sad that, in 2017, this should be something that makes a movie stand out SO MUCH that it needs to be highlighted in every article about the movie) However, apart from the Amazon's at the very start, there were only 3 main female parts for the majority of the movie - Wonder Woman, the second villain (who makes gas, but is otherwise useless in any confrontation) and Chris Pine's quirky secretary who they jokingly suggest that she is his slave...<br/><br/>9. Wonder Woman never once questions ""Where are all your women?""... She is from a world where there are only women, and women are strong and independent and warriors! Once off the island, there are, seemingly, only 2 other women (as described above). Surely because of her upbringing, Wonder Woman would at least question why there are no female soldiers in the war...?<br/><br/>10. A Native American Chief? In the middle of WWI... All by himself in enemy territory... Why was he there? What was the point of his character?<br/><br/>11. A weird Scottish marksman who is apparently the best sniper ever, but it turns out he can't shoot... Why was he there? What was the point of his character?<br/><br/>12. The other guy... I am guessing he was meant to be an Arab? Why was he there? What was the point of his character?<br/><br/>13. And perhaps the most poignant point... Chris Pine's character is the one who actually saves the day!! He is the one who ultimately stops the war by destroying the gas. Sure, Wonder Woman kills Ares... But that is an act which seemingly has no impact to the world of man because we still go on to have more wars after WWI... The main plot of this movie was to stop WWI, and it is actually Chris Pine who does that."

"Jakemcclake","8","5","9","12 November 2017"," Join Diane as She Discovers the Wonder of Who She Is
","Diane is Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), who comes from the Amazonian ruled island of Paradise which is ruled by the women warriors. She grows up and one day she rescues Steve (Chris Pine) who is a War War 1 spy escaping the Germans. He has important knowledge of something the Germans are doing, and must get it to London. After a battle between the Amazons and Germans, Diane goes with him and eventually he wants to battle the Germans, while Wonder Woman goes with him but sets out to find Ares, the god of war.<br/><br/>She is motivated by wanting to stop war, due to all the death and destruction in it.<br/><br/>Aside from the music, which is beyond super powerful, the main positive for this movie is the reveal of who Wonder Woman really is. Her true identity comes out gradually throughout the movie, until the climactic scene which causes us and her, to discover who she really is.<br/><br/>The movie has some hard to spot negatives, that I as a man am aware of, but have become insensitive to over the years. The movie is ""reverse sexist"", which is also true of thousands of B movies I watched during the 80s and 90s. Those B Movies were similar in the reverse sexism concept to ""Charlies Angels"". Those movies with stars like, Julie Strain and Sybil Danning, usually had men fighting and killing each other, and Women like Sybil and Julie fighting and killing men, and usually not much happening to the female characters who are treated as sacred compared to the men. This movie is along that line.<br/><br/>Getting past that, the movie central story conflict is related to the poem ""The Wasteland"" by TS Elliot. This poem is connected to a lot of 20th century literature (works of Fitzgerald, Hawthorne, Hemingway), and similarly it is connected to this movie.<br/><br/>Spoilers <br/><br/>The real title of what I am writing should be: ""Is The Human Race Worth Saving"" because that is a Central Theme around the conflict, that makes this story. <br/><br/>However that would be major spoiler, so I saved it for here. <br/><br/>Not surprisingly a major character in the movie, Ares the god of war says ""no"". Ares sees the death and destruction caused by the selfishness, lustfulness and greed of the human race. (As did TS Eliott and so many 20th century writers who put Wasteland imagery into their stories.) We see throughout this story, the Wasteland that is being caused by the war. But unlike those writers, Ares decides he wants to destroy mankind. At one point in the story Wonder Woman realizes how terrible mankind is, and also feels the human race is not worth saving. <br/><br/>At that point, Ares reveals himself to her, and tries to enlist her help in destroying mankind and Ares at this point, Ares lets Diane know her true identity. He literally shows her the current status of earth is a Wasteland, her how ridding the world of humans can change this Wasteland to a beautiful place. <br/><br/>But at this point (not surprisingly) Diane changes her thinking and wants the human race to survive.<br/><br/>This is the biggest spoiler so don't read it if you want to enjoy the movie: When she decides she wants the human race to survive, it puts her toe to toe in a battle for the survival of mankind with Ares.<br/><br/>Of course you can guess who and what Wonder Woman really is, if she is able to battle with Ares, the god of war.<br/><br/>Aside from the powerful music, and the great reveal of who Wonder Woman really is, there is also Gal Gadot who is Wonder Woman. Gal looks like a Miss Universe from every angle, and bears a resemblance to the woman who in the 90s was the most beautiful woman ever on the screen, Jennifer Connelly. <br/><br/>The music the reveal of who and what Wonder Woman is and Gal Gadot made the movie quite a good viewing experience."

"nlhfung","10","12","28","23 June 2017"," The Goddess of Love: a Perfect response to Batman v Superman
","""Men are still good."" said by Bruce Wayne in the funeral of Clark Kent (aka Superman). The sacrifice of Superman changes Batman, not only to remind him what a hero should be, but there is still good in mankind. One of the most controversial things about BvS is Batman's brutality towards the criminals. He was living in anger, seeking vengeance from Superman for the loss of his loved ones. The Batman we saw in BvS was different from his classic image. He was hopeless, powerless, mad, and angry, because he lost the fundamental nature of the humankind: love. <br/><br/>While BvS is a journey of Batman to rediscover hope and love, Wonder Woman is a story emphasising the importance of love and hope not only in the DC Extended Universe, but also in the mankind. Facing the loss of their love, Diana chose a very different approach from Batman. The later chose to give up love and turn to vengeance, so he could blame someone else for his guilt of being powerless in saving his family and friends. Diana did not choose the same option. From her beloved Steve Trevor, she learned that the darkness of mankind was not anyone's responsibility – men were born in this way. She could not blame Ares for the war. Men chose their own war, and that was their responsibility. However, there are both darkness and light in man. Not every bad person is evil, a sniper would fear to take a shot to his enemy, and a smuggler looking for profit would reject the money from the people he saved. That is the lesson Diana learned in the No Man's Land: When there is light, there must be shadow. What truly influences their choices, is what they believe in, and that is where love is needed. Without love, hatred would bring people into slaughter, to an endless loop with fight and vengeance. This is how Batman failed to execute justice in BvS when he was chasing after Superman. But with love, the acceptance of the flaws in mankind, and the belief in goodness of man, a better world is possible to be achieved. Although fights are still inevitable, hope is once again arose from love. This is what Diana believes in: the possibility of human to be good, and that is love. Here, Diana's choice echoes with Bruce's realisation after Superman's death – ""Men are still good"". <br/><br/>The different choices made by Diana and Batman has resulted in a different story, so as the reception of their movies. While BvS was intended to be the darkest chapter of the trilogy (Man of Steel, BvS, and Justice League), it was criticised for the deconstruction of characters and the lack of hope for a superhero (Civil War is basically the same, but the different approach of that movie fooled the audiences and critics to get away from this criticism). In contrast, Wonder Woman brings back the core value of the ""superhero movies"": love and hope. This is why it received a lot more positive receptions from the critics even though technically BvS told a better and deeper story. <br/><br/>Back to the movie, Diana's decision helped her to defeat Ares, and temporarily brought the world in to peace (we all know there was a better sequel called WWII), which was relatively a more hopeful ending. On the other hand, Batman's choice resulted in the death of Superman (a tragedy as bad as the receptions of the movie). The loss of the most powerful guardian of the planet proved how wrong Batman's decision was to hunt down the Man of Steel. His jealously and rage towards the hero did not only expose Earth to a greater danger, but also took away the love from the family and friends of the boy from Smallville, just the same as how he lost his family. Realising all the mistakes he made, Batman chooses to believe in something else this time: hope. ""I failed him in life, I won't fail him in death."" Batman's redemption makes him determined to ask Wonder Woman for help, and bring the Justice League together, against the upcoming threat that no one else can stop on his/her own. This is how we are going to see the hero we are familiar with in the Justice League movie, where the true Dark Knight returns. <br/><br/>""A hundred years ago I walked away from mankind; from a century of horrors... Men made a world where standing together is impossible."" <br/><br/>""Men are still good. We fight, we kill, we betray one another, but we can rebuild. We can do better. We will. We have to."" <br/><br/>Both stories are the journeys of the two heroes finding love and hope in the crazy world. While Wonder Woman found love in humankind, she is cynical about the unity of humans. From all the tragedies Batman went through, he once again believes in hope, and is trying his best to unite the world by forming the Justice League. The story of Wonder Woman echoes with BvS, where the complement makes both movies better. Hopefully there will be a conclusion in Justice League that echoes to the theme of all previous movies, and makes the DC Extended Universe a better franchise. It is still an on-going journey for the heroes to learn about the true nature of mankind, but one thing is certain about what these heroes believe in now: No matter how much darkness lives within mankind, men are still good."
"breheneyjames","10","12","28","13 June 2017"," This is one of the best Superhero movies ever made.
","Finally a DCEU movie that is loved by critics, fans and general audiences alike and for good reason. Everyone across the board that worked on this movie did a fabulous job and this is amply evident from; the amazing and nuanced performances to the assured direction to the resplendent cinematography to the beautiful, attentive production design and costume design. This a very different film from the previous two efforts in the DCEU, namely Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, in that it is a standalone story set in World War 1 which allows director Patty Jenkins to really home in on and redefine Wonder Woman for a new generation and that she does with great success in this movie. <br/><br/>One thing I particularly admire about Patty Jenkins is her attitude towards Superheroes. She not so long ago said something along the lines of 'The word ""cheesiness"" is banned in my world' and it really shows. In a time of Superhero movies like Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy that wink at the camera at every opportunity, it was really refreshing to see a Superhero movie done earnestly and with a passion for seriousness. Also, Jenkins pays homage to classics of the genre such as Richard Donner's 1978 Superman and Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider-Man. If you have seen these two movies you will recognize the homages immediately when you see them. <br/><br/>However, even with these qualities the movie is still very humorous due to the 'fish out of water' scenario Diana finds herself in from the second act onward. Gal Gadot is outstanding in this role. She displays naivety, compassion, wonder (no pun intended), bravery, strength and heroism with abundant aptitude. Chris Pine is also fantastic as Steve Trevor. They have bundles of chemistry together and the film really is elevated because of this. Lucy Davis is remarkable as Etta Candy and really leaves an impression despite her limited screen time.<br/><br/>I heard some complaints about the villain in this movie, namely Ares the God of War, alluding to him being undeveloped. For me, these complaints don't hold any weight because in my view the real villain in this movie is not something physical but rather the darkness that lurks inside all humanity. The sign of a good hero-villain dynamic is that they compete for the same goal. That is what happens here. They are competing for the heart of mankind. Ares wants to reveal them as greedy, corrupt and dysfunctional and Diana believes that Man is good, kind and compassionate. In the end, she learns that they are a dichotomy of the two and it comes down to what people choose to be as she tells Ares what she learned from Steve Trevor: ""It's not about deserve, it's about what you believe and I believe in Love"". <br/><br/>In summary, I could not recommend this movie enough. This is one of the best Superhero movies ever made."

Where Cavill and Routh could not match christoher Reeve as superman and affleck yet to surpass both bale and Keaton as Bruce Wayne aka Batman. I said before I saw this that I hope it didn't disappoint like the previous 3 DCEU movies which where OK but the trailers made them look awesome. I said to myself if this is not as good as the flash from TV then forget. The chemistry between gadot and pine is perfect and the supporting cast holds up the story. What I liked about this film is although she has superpowers as such it felt more like a grounded non powered universe more like arrow but the fight scenes were much more superior. I wont say to much but if you felt let down by previous movies in dc then this will restore your faith. Amazing movie."

"julia-00157","9","13","31","9 June 2017"," Wonderfilled Wonderful Wonder Woman
","This movie is like, really good. Disclaimer: This review is coming from someone who has never consumed wonder woman media of any kind before this movie. I've never read the comics, seen any of the TV shows or anything. This review is based solely off this movie. <br/><br/>Now me, I'm not really into super hero movies, but after hearing all the rave reviews about this one, I figured I would have to see it. And boy, I do not regret it. It was incredible. From start to finish this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat with heart-pounding action scenes, tense drama, lovable characters, a light to balance the darkness, and an overarching love story (familial love, friendly love, and romantic love)<br/><br/>The beginning sets the tone with female warriors training, but also propels into the mythicality that drives the plot. We are introduced to young Diana and her home island. After being trained as the strongest warrior on the island, the one who will kill Ares, the God of War, a soldier, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes into their secluded island, bringing with him a fleet of ships. This battle scene is the first that marks the serious tone that carries through the rest of the movie. What this film does really well that a lot of other superheroes origins fall short on is balancing the light and the dark. It is a serious movie, but it is also humorous. It's not overbearing but still able to maintain a dark element. A tough thing to pull off that should be commended on all levels. <br/><br/>Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, and the ensemble manage to create such lovable characters from the first time you see them. Wonder Woman (Gadot) knows her way around HER world, but there are some things in the real world that she's experiencing for the first time (like snow and ice cream) and some social norms she can't quite wrap her head around (no women on the battlefield, unnecessary casualties in war). She also doesn't take any crap, an empowering quality all too lacking from most women in film. She doesn't want to hear your ""that's not how it works,"" or ""you can't do that,"" because who gets to decide that? Chris Pine creates and actually attractive love interest. He's charismatic and funny without being Trademark Charismatic and Funny. <br/><br/>As someone who never read the comics, the story as a complete surprise for me, and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It kept me guessing, and never fell flat. Even though I had accidentally read some spoilers before seeing it, everything was still a surprise as it was happening. The story doesn't lose sight of it's beginning, and carries through to the end as one story, not a collection of events. It keeps hold of the strength displayed in the first few minutes until the end credits roll. <br/><br/>Yes, there is a CGI filled, everyone-go-at-it final act, but can you name one superhero movie that doesn't contain this? This movie is the first one I've seen in a long time that does it well, although it still hit a few snags along the way. <br/><br/>I cannot recommend this movie enough. Not only is it fantastic that we get a female superhero movie, a box office smash from a female director, and a new series to look forward to, we also just got a really good movie that everyone, female and male, should see."

","After seeing the film twice, I'm sat at my desk writing this review with the Blu-Ray pre-ordered on Amazon and the film's soundtrack blasting through my stereo. My actions here speak louder than the words in this review.<br/><br/>Warner Bros. and DC Comics have released their fourth installment of the DCEU following Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad. These previous films all had a mixed reception between critics and audiences, however, with Wonder Woman, this is not the case. Currently sat at a critical and audience score of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes this film is being constantly praised, and too right.<br/><br/>The dramatic and comedic tones were perfectly balanced. Such a glaring omission from the previous DC offerings was any real feeling of levity. Jokes were well timed and delivered perfectly. The comedic lines were not out of place or shoved in to appease those looking for a lighter superhero film, but were relevant to the location or event. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine's chemistry was automatic and more convincing than grass being green. The romance wasn't shoved down our necks straight away, the film took it's time to allow the chemistry to flourish and develop.<br/><br/>Even before Wonder Woman, DC films have one shining quality to them, music. There is something to be said for the theme song of this movie which was featured in Batman v Superman as well. Try to hum the theme to the Avengers. How about Captain America? The most recent Spider- man? The majority of people will not be able to do this, as the music to Marvel films are unrecognizable. However, dating back to Christopher Reeves Superman, all DC films (with a few exceptions) have a recognizable theme. Wonder Woman's theme is visceral and will be immediately recognizable after you've heard it. It's featured in key moments of the film, adding to the weight of the already powerful action.<br/><br/>To me, this film was reminiscent to the original Christopher Reeves Superman films from the 70's and 80's. The film was purely dark and gloomy the entire time, it allowed itself to be hopeful and be whimsical.<br/><br/>As this film is set during World War One, we are treated to an astounding scene in No Man's Land where Diana deflects hundreds of bullets with her shield and forges the path for the British soldiers. Her reasons for doing this was to end the suffering of the soldiers and civilians from the German army. On her way, she encountered many injured from battle and those grieving. Steve Trevor, a realist kept reminding Diana that there was nothing she could do to help them, until she reached No Man's Land and proved that an idealist can also prevail. From her courage and determination she was able to save the British soldiers and liberate a small village that was previously under German control. Diana's innocent and loving ideology is the main theme of this film in every scene and is conveyed so convincingly it brought tears to my eyes at many moments.<br/><br/>Diana's reasoning for being at the front-line was to kill Ares (the God of War) who she believed was the cause and reason of this war. During the film, the audience have no certain idea on who Ares is, giving another sense of mystery and intrigue to the film, other than, ""we know who the bad guy is, the hero will find him and kill him yay!"". When we see Ares we are treated to an oil painting of stunning visual effects and amazing character development. However, I'm not going to spoil the ending, but one criticism would be how many of the dialogue in the final battle from Ares is very cliché, with lines such as, ""I will destroy you!"". Do not get me wrong, the scene is incredible, but you cannot help but think it is slightly overused in many films.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman balances loving ideology, Greek mythos, warfare and humor in one masterfully crafted package. The film also lacks predictability and does not have a clichéd ""Hollywood Ending"". Even if you are someone who is not a fan of superhero films, you can easily watch this film and enjoy it fully.<br/><br/>I could go on for pages and pages writing about how amazing this film is, but this is a review, not a nerdy analysis, so go and see the film. I highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone. This is the superhero film that will hopefully set the tone for Justice League and all other upcoming DC Comics films.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 10/10"
"Carycomic","10","13","31","3 June 2017"," A two-and-a-half hour thrill ride that delivers what it promises...and ""so much more.""
","Those aren't sarcastic quote marks, either! <br/><br/>This movie basically serves as a prequel to BATMAN V. SUPERMAN in that it explains the strange WWI-era photograph Bruce Wayne found in the latter film. Which is a good thing. Because, as most of us fanboys over age thirty know, the comic book Wonder Woman started out as a super-heroine fighting against the Axis Powers of World War II! <br/><br/>But, as the late, great Peter O'Toole pointed out (in that 1980 cult classic THE STUNT MAN), World War I is one of the most romanticized conflicts in military history. If only because it demonstrated to those born and raised in the Victorian era that war is _not_ romantic! Especially for those caught in the crossfire (literally and otherwise). It was in WWI that tanks, war planes, and fully automatic machine guns were first invented. So, naturally, there would never again be anymore marching into battle with fifers and drummers leading the way.<br/><br/>Diana of Themiscyra (having been raised on a well-nicknamed Paradise Island) is the perfect personification of all that culture shock. And Gal Gadot, having been born and raised in often-war-torn Israel, is able to give us (the viewing audience) a very convincing simulation of that shock. Even with the slightly jaded Steve Trevor as her tour guide! <br/><br/>That brings us to Chris Pine. <br/><br/>The U.S. Army didn't officially enter WWI till 1916, at the earliest. But, quite a few individuals didn't want to wait that long. So, they either joined the famed Lafayette Escadrille via the French Foreign Legion. Or they joined the British army as horse-drawn ambulance drivers. As Pine's version of Trevor is working for British Military Intelligence, I venture to think he was recruited into the latter via their French counterparts (Le Deauxieme Bureau). If so, I have to commend him for whatever boning up he did on the historical background of WWI. Turkey was, indeed, a German ally during that war. That, in turn, makes Steve Trevor's presence in the Mediterranean even more plausible. As he would no doubt have been trying to get to the British naval base on Malta in that stolen monoplane!<br/><br/>I also have to give kudos to the characters of Samir, Charlie, and the Chief. Original characters they might be (with undertones of a politically incorrect joke about three guys walking into a bar). But, they still lend a very nice mixed bag of poignancy and comic relief to this film.<br/><br/>As for David Thewlis? Well, let's just say (for those who haven't see the movie, already) that Sir Patrick Morgan is _not_ Bruce Wayne's great-great-grandfather."
"GomezAddams666","10","13","31","1 June 2017"," Perfection, it was worth the wait.
","I seriously do not know where to begin with this one. I have waited so long to watch this movie with expectations as high as the sky and not only were they all met, but they were also left behind... by a long shot.<br/><br/>This movie is just amazing, the tone is great, the pacing is really good, the plot is beyond this world, the photography is just beautiful and you can see Patty Jenkins was the right person to direct this movie as you can feel her passion throughout the film.<br/><br/>And speaking about passion, Gal Gadot is wonderful (pun definitely intended) in the role of Diana Prince. She is a beautiful woman but it goes beyond it, you can feel the power of her character thru her eyes, she makes you feel every emotion Diana is feeling, you can identify with this goddess and her struggle to see the world thru the eyes of human beings. The rest of the cast does a marvelous job, but Gadot is just amazing.<br/><br/>And I have to talk about the impact of this film on the DCEU, THIS is without a discussion the best movie of the saga by far, THIS is how you make a movie about a god and make her look human, they have hit the jackpot on this one and one can assume that the future of the DCEU is safe, as long of course as they keep delivering this kind of material that is just too good.<br/><br/>I struggle to rate it, but I will definitely rate it a 10/10 just because they put an effort into making this movie and you feel it thru the screen and their loyalty to the characters has to be rewarded.<br/><br/>As hard as it is to believe there has never been a solo Wonder Woman movie since the character's creation 75 years ago. I can honestly say it was worth the wait."

","I know you probably won't take my advice and will go and watch to see for yourself, but I promise you, you will regret it.<br/><br/>This movie is by far the worst superhero movie, and on my top 5 for the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie is basically, we want to make women heroes too. It doesn't matter if it is cringy and incoherent terrible story line. It only make sense if the producers were college freshman girls who just took Greek mythology class, and would like to let the world know what they learned. All this aside, the ""Amazons"" trying to fake an accent is the cringiest thing I have heard in a long time.<br/><br/>Conclusion, go tell you little brother/sister bed time story, and don't wast your time on this BS."
"shimonvakninil","2","14","34","24 June 2017"," The buzz around the movie is a lot more impressive that the content
","I'll be brief and to the point: As can be exited - the production, special effects, and crew is impressive. But the content is pretty shallow. A messed-up Greek theology that presents Gal Gadot as a goddess. And subsequently, most of her acting is computer aided (CGI). Bottom line: shallow content plus too much CGI equals disappointment."

","It may contains spoilers.. But i don't think so...<br/><br/>As much as i think that Gal Gadot is one of the hottest females in the world I strongly believe that she is way too untalented as an actress... Seriously my aesthetic was damaged after seeing her in Wonderwoman... As for the movie it's one of the worst i've seen in the theaters... Luck of screenplay and interest... The whole movie is a worship for a beautiful woman with silly dialogues and extra scenes with no point (aka the man who sells ice-cream in the train station during the war!). I don't even want to mention the scene where they drink their beers and she is replacing the cup on every second. Not even Scorsese does these mistakes in his movies.<br/><br/>The last fight scene was nice though.<br/><br/>I truly believe that ""Mummy"" probably will be better....

It is a bad movie in every aspect you can think of. The acting is terrible, the plot is ridiculous, The CGI is mediocre at best and it is way-way too long (so I heard cause I didn't stay lol). I can't believe a big studio approved it. Then again... it's a DC universe movie I should have expected it. I gave it 2 stars (instead of 1) just because of Gal Gadot."

","Went in and saw it. I cried, I laughed, I loved it overall.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Gal and Chris was perfection, the diversity and performances from the supporting cast was wonderful. The plot never leaves the audience bored, the action sequences were on point, and the comedy timing was very well placed! I bought the tickets the first chance I had so I was one of the film's early audience; my expectations was met and exceeded wonderfully. So it was an honor to be one of the first crowds to witness this gorgeous art! Here's hoping Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot will continue as a duo in future Wonder Woman projects!"
"ThomasDrufke","9","14","34","1 June 2017"," Exactly What the DCEU and World Needs
","To say Wonder Woman is exactly the film we need right now is understatement. Not only is the DCEU in the midst of 2 critical bombs, off-camera issues, and desperate fans, but the world itself needs a bit of saving. There's so much hatred in the world that seeing a character like Wonder Woman set such a beautiful example in her ways is incredibly inspiring, and I mean both the character and the film itself. Action-packed, funny, and surprisingly touching, Wonder Woman is not just the film to save the DCEU, but it could very well reinvigorate the superhero genre once again.<br/><br/>I might as well say upfront that Gal Gadot kills it as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. Even after an all too brief appearance in last year's Batman v Superman, I had my doubts that she could lead a franchise on her own. While I can still see some room to grow, her charisma, physicality, and chemistry with Chris Pine is the backbone of this film. Her smile is infectious, her punch is fist pump worthy, and her stature is awe inspiring and admiring. It's almost to the point where I'm having a hard time seeing anyone else in the role.<br/><br/>I hadn't seen any of Patty Jenkins work before this, and I became instantly interested in checking out her other work after watching what she did with Wonder Woman. There's definitely some carry over from Zack Snyder's style in the previous DCEU adventures, but I think Jenkins brought in some much needed humanity to this story. Just by looking at the tone of Wonder Woman you can see the clear difference between this and any of the 3 DCEU films. It more closely resembles the heart that Man of Steel brought to the table, but perhaps with a little less bleakness.<br/><br/>The film does struggle a little with pacing in the first half, but it does surprisingly well developing characters. I hate to keep comparing it to other DC or Marvel films, but I would have a hard time thinking of a first superhero film (or Origin story) that did this well developing and writing characters. The supporting characters each had their own respected arcs and the relationship between Steve Trevor and Diana is truly something special. It reminded me a lot of Peggy and Steve's dynamic in The First Avenger, innocent and charming. The writing is so good, in fact, that it allowed me to forgive a lot of the late game CGI and green screen, because at that point I was already invested in all the characters.<br/><br/>But even with all the action, laughs, and fun characters, it's all about the message. The power of love has been done over and over again in films, but it's rare that it is executed as well as it is here. We fall in love with Wonder Woman's innocence in the situation she's in, and she falls in love with human's drive to do what's right. It's a really powerful message and takes Wonder Woman to levels that I'm not sure most superhero films are able to match. So yes, the film is one of the best action films of the year, and certainly is up there on the all-time superhero list, but it's way more important than that.<br/><br/>+Writing/directing<br/><br/>+Gadot leads with charisma<br/><br/>+Funny and heartwarming dynamic between Steve & Diana<br/><br/>+Great action<br/><br/>-Pacing a little slow in the beginning<br/><br/>9.3/10"

","This movie has an incredible, riveting story and fantastic performances. Gal Gadot's and Chris Pine's chemistry is flawless and believable. The story was exciting and doesn't let up. The music is really good. If you've seen Batman v Superman(which you should), the Wonder Woman theme from that movie has returned, but it is used appropriately and is badass whenever it plays. The theme plays a total of 3 times throughout the film, and isn't used when it shouldn't be. It also has something that Batman versus Superman lacked, comedy. This movie is very funny, it's not as funny as a Marvel movie, but it has enough that the film benefits from it and doesn't ruin the tone of the film. Speaking of tone, it is still as dark as a DC movie, it has death throughout it, but the humor keeps it fun. You should definitely see this film, it is a fun ride that you won't forget."

"seandmillz","8","9","20","12 July 2017"," A strange prevalence of hatred towards this fine movie, don't listen to it.
","I'm sure by now many people reading this review are well aware that this movie is quite good. The strange hatred towards it is an act of rebellion against women, as silly as that concept is in a still male-dominated society, and it is not a reflection of the movie's quality. Some people can't accept change, they abhor it like nature abhors a vacuum: a swift and equal response to all things that don't adhere to their pathetically limited worldview. I expect a very similar response to Black Panther later this year. Instead of sexism it will be racism, and it'll be just as sad. That being said, I welcome these criticisms against these movies. These movies empower those that deserve to be empowered, and the critiques (at least the ridiculously unjustified ones,) really let you know that the world is changing and leaving certain undesirables behind.<br/><br/>As for an actual review instead of a rant against sexism, the movie is fine. The CG isn't the best in class, but it's good enough. Gal Gadot was admirable, as expected. Heck, even Chris Pine drops a decent performance. The other supporting cast did a serviceable job, but they were a little one dimensional. The movie doesn't run on infinite time, so I forgive it that flaw. My main issues are with the pacing, and the fact that the movie didn't capitalize properly on it's villain. It was in service to a bold story beat, so it's not a total loss, though. Besides the sometimes mediocre effects and the way they handled the villain, this movie doesn't have too much wrong with it. Some campy dialogue, but it's not unwelcome and it's fun. Go see the movie, and please come back to write a review to undermine these trolling losers that want nothing more than to bring down the people they have the least experience with."

","It's taken decades to happen, before Lynda Carter was the only incarnation that comes to everyone's mind, but now finally the DC Comics creation hit the big screen in this highly anticipated solo movie, directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster). Basically on the hidden island of Themyscira, is the home to the Amazon race of warrior women, created by the gods of Mount Olympus, to protect humankind against the god of war Ares. In the distant past, Ares slew his fellow gods, until his mortally wounded his father Zeus struck him down, before succumbing to his injuries, Zeus left the Amazons a weapon capable of killing his renegade son: the ""Godkiller"". Diana (Gal Gadot) was born and raised on Themuscira, but she was forbidden from training as a warrior, but defied her mother Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), training in secret with her aunt General Antiope (Robin Wright), they are eventually discovered, but Antiope convinces her sister to allow the training to continue. One day, off the coast of the island, a plane crashes into the sea, Diana rescues American pilot Captain Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), soon after the island is invaded by German soldiers, the Amazons engage and kill the invaders, but Antiope dies from a bullet shot. Interrogated with the Lasso of Truth, Steve reveals that he is a spy working to stop the great war, i.e. World War I, and he has stolen a notebook belonging to Spanish chief chemist Isabel Maru aka ""Doctor Poison"" (Elena Anaya), working under the orders of General Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) to create a deadly form of gas. Diana believes that Ares is responsible for the war, she arms herself with the ceremonial sword, which she believes to be the ""Godkiller"", Diana is unaware it is actually her that is the great weapon, she is also given a strong armour, and leaves Themyscira with Steve to find and destroy Ares. Diana and Steve arrive in London, they deliver Maru's notebook to Steve's superiors, including Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis), who is attempting a negotiation with Germany for a formal agreement to end the war, Diana translates the notebook, it reveals the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the war front. Steve is forbidden by his commanders to act, but with secret funding from Sir Patrick, he recruits spy Sameer (Saïd Taghmaoui), marksman Charlie (Trainspotting's Ewen Bremner), and smuggler The Chief (Eugene Brave Rock) to help him and Diana infiltrate enemy lines and prevent the gas from being released. The team reach the Western Front in Belgium, enemy machine guns stop them from crossing No Man's Land, but Diana pushes alone through the battlefield to the village of Veld, the Allied forces rally with behind her, the team celebrate with a group photograph, and it is implied, after a kiss, that Diana and Steve spend the night together. The team learn of a gala being held at German High Command, Steve infiltrates the party, intending to locate the new mustard gas and destroy it, but Diana believes Ludendorff is Ares and killing him will end the war, Steve stops her to avoid blowing their cover and jeopardising the mission. The gas is released on Veld, killing all of its inhabitants, Diana blames Steve for intervening, and pursues Ludendorff to a military base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber bound for London, Diana fights and kills the general, who was using another of Dr. Maru's gases to become physically enhanced, but she is dejected when his death does not stop the war. Sir Patrick appears, he reveals that he is actually Ares, although he has subtly given the humans the ideas and inspirations, it is ultimately the decision of humankind to cause war and violence. Ares destroys the ceremonial sword, and reveals to Diana that she is the ""Godkiller"", she is the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, and therefore Ares' half-sister, he attempts to convince Diana that humanity is inherently corrupt, and that she should help him restore paradise on Earth and destroy humankind. Diana and Ares battle, while Steve and his team destroy Dr. Maru's laboratory, Steve sacrifices himself by piloting the bomber carrying the gas, taking it to a safe altitude, stopping it reaching its destination, and exploding in the sky, Ares tries to influence Diana through her rage to kill the helpless Dr. Maru. But Diana's memories of Steve inspire her that humans have good within them, she spares Maru out of mercy, and is able to overpower and destroy Ares, in the end the team return to London, the nation celebrate the end of the war. Finally, in the present, Diana Prince has not aged, she is a curator for the Louvre's Department of Antiquities, she receives a message from Bruce Wayne, containing the group photo, she is reaffirmed of her mission to protect all life, as Wonder Woman.

Gadot was one of the only good points worth mentioning from the atrocity that was Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, she proves perfect casting as the beautiful warrior princess with ferocious principles, and there is great support from Pine, Thewlis, Huston and Wright. This fourth entry in the DC Extended Universe, following three movies with mixed results, works well as an origins story for the Amazonian superwoman, with plenty of punch and personality, with a good message of feminism, and a stirring insight into all elements of warfare, with a terrifically crafted script and plenty of exciting special effects ladened fight sequences, this will not disappoint, a most entertaining superhero action. Very good!"

","I was pretty excited going into see Wonder Woman as the reviews were stellar and the user rating on IMDb was maintaining a high rating after being released several days. Alas, I don't feel it was that great.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives. Gal Gadot was great. The faults with the film do not lie with her and it was great to see Wonder Woman on screen finally. Chris Pine was also great and their chemistry together was sensational. The look of the film was also great.<br/><br/>Now the not so good. The story wasn't entirely compelling. WW's journey had some strong points but overall the story felt a bit all over the place. There were many supporting characters but they seem to add chaos rather than support. It wasn't entirely clear what the point of some of those characters were.<br/><br/>There are some pretty cool action sequences but the CG gets a bit noticeable at times.<br/><br/>There are some other points that bother me but I won't get into those as they may provide spoilers."

"dheven-42066","10","10","23","17 July 2017"," Another Superhero movie we deserve!
","Wonder Woman<br/><br/>I'm not a comic book fan that's why I don't give a crap about marvel movies (excpt: CA: Winter Soldier) but this movie blew me away. Its not just a action flick you usually get with marvel movies( no hate) but also an emotional movie. It has a beautiful lovable cast, story, directing, cinematography, music and etc .. But I gotta admit, at first i was a bit of disappointed because of what they'd shown in the trailer like there's no thrill watching it but then when at the last part of the movie, I was shocked and I didn't expect it at all. Yeah it was kinda cliché but it was a good plot twist for the movie. It was refreshing to watch a superhero movie like that 'cause these days, its always comedy and war to the point you'll just rely with the story of it for your time's worth. But this movie gave us something, something we haven't seen in any superhero movie. ""It's not about what you deserve. It's about what you believe."" that was a good quote, by the way, even though its simple. Diana and Steve story was achingly beautiful. In a short amount of time they got in each other's skin and fell in love with each other but the problem was, they fell for each other in a wrong place and time. This is the second time I watched a superhero got me off guard (BvS:DOJ). In this origin story its not just about what the character did to save the world, it also showed how and why the character became a hero to the world as diana witnessed all the goodness and bad in this world."
"MikeEhms","4","10","23","6 July 2017"," Just another dumb blockbuster
","Wonder Woman (2017) was a very mediocre and over-hyped film. By all accounts not a terrible film, and it is somewhat of an improvement from other DC movies (for one thing the tone is actually very focused and appropriate), but it's really not good. First off, the movie is bland as hell. You've seen this before. A princess who wants to go and fight but her mother refuses to let her until the end of the first act when she lets her go just because. The first twenty minutes literally feels like a Disney princess movie (especially Moana) but incredibly rushed. After that it's mildly interesting with the whole WW1 aesthetic, but you can still predict every single story/character beat throughout the rest of the film. From a narrative perspective I have no issues with continuity and motivations (aside from some side characters and the villains being super simplistic), but there's a huge problem in the final act that I'll get to later. Now I could forgive that if everything else surrounding the film was great, which not much was. The best part of the movie was Chris Pine. I could relate to him, he was charming as hell, he had the best lines (and some not so great ones), and his chemistry with Gal Gadot was fantastic. He's easily the best written DCEU character. And also Gal Gadot was okay. She did a much better job here than in Batman v Superman (mainly since she had actual lines). But even though it's obvious that she's not the best actress, you can tell that she gave it her all and brought a fun, child-like innocence to her performance. And that's where the good performances stop, everyone else either over-acts like their in a cartoon *cough* the main villains *cough* or talks like they have a foot in their mouth. It was really distracting and even annoying. Not to mention that no other character is anywhere near as developed as the main two; everyone else is extremely flat and forgettable. Now this is a $100M summer blockbuster, so there are some things you'd assume would be good, like the CGi and other special effects. Not in this movie. The special effects in this movie are some of the worst I've seen in a long time. Nothing looks even close to real, and nothing looks stylized enough to be visually pleasing. There's even a scene where a young Wonder Woman jumps off a cliff and it has the worst green screen I've seen in years. This is the cheapest looking blockbuster I've seen since like Gods of Egypt. But hey, if the effects aren't good but the action and choreography are good then it doesn't matter. And the action in this movie is fine. The choreography is decent and it's not an eye sore like other movies, but every single action scene comprises of 75% slow-mo. Which I get what they were trying to do: make WW seem bigger than life and so her action scenes are supposed to be bigger than life and mesmerizing. In which it's cool at first, but Christ it gets old real quick. This all leads to the mess of a final act, which I'll give it this: it's not as bad as the other DCEU final acts. At the very least it's short. (SPOILERS) But Jesus it's still incredibly stupid and grossly overblown to the point where it ends like all the others: there's dust and lightning all-over the place while the hero(es) charges at the big bad and levels the entire area, BUT SOMEHOW ALL THE SIDE CHARACTERS ARE OKAY. Not to mention that the twist leading up to this is the one of the most insulting and frustrating out of a blockbuster I've ever seen. There's this general of the German forces that they show to be the big bad guy, and WW believes that he is Ares (the Greek god of war) and that killing him will end WW1. They build it up that she's naive about real-life war and human conflict, and that Chris Pine will have to tell her the truth. They get to the point where she kills the general but is confused as to why nobody has changed. Chris Pine then tells her that sometimes there is no bad guy; that humans are just flawed and some are just evil or will kill innocents without any sort of coercion. This is genius. Not only is it a great real-world message but it's also a great satire of superhero stories since it ends by revealing that the superhero didn't finish the job by killing one big bad guy and that they can't save everyone. Good thing that lasts about 5 minutes. Literally the next scene reveals that Ares does exist and it was this one guy who had like two lines in the first hour. And it turns out he does coerce people to do bad things. They tried to cover it up by saying that he ""only gave them ideas to improve their battle tactics, they killed each other by their own conscience"", but no, they already shot themselves in the foot with this twist. And then we get the terrible light show final battle and the movie ends. <br/><br/>In short; Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are the saving graces of a bland, stupid, ugly movie. Sadly one DCEU's best. 4/10."

","Yesterday evening I was at the movies to watch the new Wonder Woman. Not much else to say other than the movie was absolutely amazing!<br/><br/>I don't really like the DC characters too much, I rather prefer anything the Marvel Universe has to offer. But at the end of the flick I couldn't do anything else but applauding.<br/><br/>Since the first part of Avengers there was (in my opinion) no other ""superhero"" movie that came close. Well I think that has changed now, this might just be my new favorite of both DC and Marvel.<br/><br/>The actress is stunning... using Sameers perfect expression: I am both frightened and aroused.<br/><br/>Thank you DC for an amazing cinema experience!

"ezramandela","10","10","23","17 June 2017"," Awesome!!
","I'd like to think that i was one of the few who were not really looking forward to this film. The trailers did nothing to spark my interest and it almost looked like Gal would not deliver. Boy was I wrong! Wonder Woman has pretty much everything superhero movies of today seem to have forgotten about. It has heart, and it really makes you care so much about what Diana is going through and what is happening around her. Yes the CGI did look corny in some scenes but I'd like to believe that this was overshadowed by the story telling and character development. This was a big step up for Gal Gadot, and Chris Pine definitely owned the role of Steve Trevor. All the supporting cast, apart from a few issues, did almost everything right to add on to the chemistry between the two leading characters. I loved the portrayal of ""Themyscira"" (I hope I spelled it right), and the opening fight scene with with the amazonian warriors was great. The pacing was just about okay, and the directing was almost perfect. As far as superhero movies go, I'll give this a 10/10. Way to go DC!!"
"annaldavies","10","10","23","11 June 2017"," Unexpected
","Always been a massive marvel film fan but never seemed to click with the DC adaptations of the comics hugely. So going into this film I wasn't sure what I was expecting to see but after just 10 minutes of watching I realized that it was going to be very good. Round of applause for DC and Warner bros because this film had almost everything you'd expect to see in a ideal superhero film. The way the story is set out as a reflection on her past and brings us to her childhood really builds up the character and makes the film much more enjoyable. Gal Godot was excellently cast and and was mesmerizing to watch on the big screen. Chris Pine was the perfect pair to her character and added humour and depth to the story-line. Would definitely recommend giving a watch however be aware that you may be running around and pretending you are as strong a Wonder Woman for up to a month after watching the film."

","Wonder Woman is one of the best comic book superhero movies ever & I've seen them all over the past few decades. Gal Gadot showed her brilliant ability to be fierce, strong, & tough & at the same time, sweet, lovable, & kind. Chris Pine was excellent as her first & only love interest, Steve Trevor. One of the things that surprised me most was how thoroughly awesome & bad-ass Robin Wright was as Antiope. The rest of the cast were perfect for their roles & last but not least, Patty Jenkins proved without a doubt what a superb director she is. I can't wait to see what she will bring to the table next! I loved it so much that I know I will be seeing Wonder Woman multiple times at the theater during its hopefully very long run! Easy 10 out of 10!"

This movie lived up to the hype!"
"arabnikita","10","15","38","2 June 2017"," Refreshing experience for superhero movies
","This film has met and exceeded my expectations... The only superhero movies that are on the same level as Wonder Woman are Captain America The Winter Soldier and Logan.<br/><br/>The film is very refreshing in many ways. First and most obvious is the magnificent female lead performed by Gal Gadot who is a perfect fit for this role. Second, a good balance of humor and seriousness, something that Marvel can't grasp after all these years. The movie is funny just when it needs to be and when the story gets more serious, all the jokes are eliminated. Third, choosing WW1 instead of WW2 because it was a conflict with no clear villain where all sides were to blame, and this concept fits the story perfectly. <br/><br/>The director and cinematographers wonderfully manage to show the transition from paradise-like Themiskyra to regular Earth which is dark, corrupted, hateful and war torn; the theme that DCEU portrays in its comics, animation films and games. They show how Diana is shocked by this world and how she evolves while staying true to her core values and beliefs. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine kicks off right from the first glance and it was something marvelous and heart warming to watch. The rest of the cast deserves high praise too. <br/><br/>My favorite part... the MUSIC. I would never give a movie a 10 if the music is not a right fit and this time it is a BIG 10!!! I got hyped about it from BVS and now finally I got my overdose of goosebumps and thrills. When it was combined with the action scenes, I almost jumped up on my chair. Speaking of action scenes... they were as Kick-ass as they come, right from the beginning until the end with fantastic camera work and great balance between Slow-mo and regular shots. <br/><br/>There are not enough words to describe this film, its a start of something new and very big which I hope will be replicated in the rest of DCEU films. As wonderful a back-story as there could be!!! <br/><br/>THANK YOU ALL FOR MAKING THIS"

Movies is entertaining, not as bad as Suicide Squad but definitely not as good as the Dark Night, and most definitely not an 8, perhaps not even a 7. Gal Gadot's acting is bad towards the end of the movie. The movie begins very well, actually I think the first half of the movie is really good, but the last half is so dumb, SO dumb it hurts.

She looked so skinny and weak for the DC-based Amazonian Goddess.<br/><br/>I know that she is an eye-candy; but guys, this is an action film. come on.<br/><br/>A better choice would have been Gina Carano, the MMA fighter who played Angel Dust in Deadpool.

"antoniokowatsch","6","11","26","15 June 2017"," An over-hyped movie, much too predictable
","I really don't understand all the hype that surrounds this particular movie. I had pretty high expectations for it and was quite disappointed when I actually got to see it. The only good thing that the movie had going for it was the film score and the cinematography. But if you look at the story line the movie is extremely one-dimensional. There is no real plot and almost no character development, literally. So, there's not much substance to all these high praises that this movie managed to accumulate. It seems. <br/><br/>But just to be perfectly clear about it; this movie felt like feminist propaganda. And when I'm saying feminist I'm not referring to the textbook definition of feminism but rather the now established cult of man-hating individuals. As an egalitarian I can totally get behind the ""third wave of feminism"", which has very little in common with today's feminism. But I digress. The reason why I believe this to be the aforementioned type of propaganda is pretty simple to deduce; the protagonist is female, morally superior and virtually invincible (at no point during the movie was the life of the protagonist in any real danger*). Meanwhile all the men are portrayed as ""horny"", dumb, ""needlessly"" violent, expendable, and anything but virtuous. With the sole exception of the other protagonist (aka the ""crashed pilot"") who I'd dare to call a ""token man"" because of what fate awaits him during the end segment of the movie. I don't know about you but I call this very bad story telling. Ideally one should try to make every character just a little bit flawed (even the protagonist), otherwise the whole story just feels like literal propaganda. The writers intent clearly bleeds into the script in this particular case. One would have to be blind to not see that.<br/><br/>*just to elaborate on the point that I made earlier: the protagonist was never in any situation that one could describe as ""dangerous"". She was clearly overpowered, and just to take the point home; the movie literally starts out with a scene from the end segment of another movie ""Batman Vs Superman"", which literally tells us that no matter what happens in this movie, at the end she'll make it out alive with a memento of a war (the photo). So that scene right there pretty much summarizes half of the movie, no pun intended. <br/><br/>To conclude: I feel really saddened. Not by the fact that the movie was rather mediocre but by the fact that most people don't even realize it. That's the real tragedy."
"jtoy412","10","11","26","4 June 2017"," One of the best movies I have ever seen.
","As a male who is in his teens (16), I found the Wonder Woman movie an entertaining and inspirational film. This movie showed that Wonder Woman is not just a hero for Females but for everyone. Gal Gadot was pretty hot as Wonder Woman and delivered an exceptional job on her performance showing innocents and hope when needed with killer action sequences that kept me engaged throughout the whole movie. Chris Pine's portraying of Steve Trevor was amazing as well with his added charm and comedy to the movie with some of his own killer action sequences. Both portrayals of these characters showed great chemistry throughout the film which kept me invested with these characters. The two negatives in this movie was the villains which are sub-par for such a blockbuster and some shaking cgi in the final battle which could have been tweak prior to the film's release (no film is prefect). Overall the message this film sends of love and hope really makes this movie for everyone to watch. With some negatives I found, it still does not take away from this film to be inspirational and entertaining. This film saved the DC extended universe and is a must watch."

Better see him in Fargo 3, where he really shines!<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is the usual superhero cash grab fest based on a completely predictable, paint by numbers script. The script here is so interchangeable it could fit any Hollywood heroes from Indiana Jones to Robert Downey Jr's impersonation of Sherlock Holmes. <br/><br/>On the bright side there are a few laughs here, including the unintentional ones when they cut back and forth between the stunt woman and Gal Gadot.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman this is surely not, but a brainless 141 min adventure ride.

","2 stars out of 10 because it was pretty to look at and seemed well made from a technical point of view.<br/><br/>That's about it. The rest was really bad, I don't understand how anybody can give this a positive review. Trying to avoid spoilers (not that it matters, there's not a single thing in the movie that you won't predict):<br/><br/>1. Wonder Woman herself is basically invincible. Superman has Kryptonite, Batman has the no-killing thing, Wonder Woman though is a tank. Bullets just bounce off her and she has super-human strength, even against the bad guy who takes some sort of serum to make him stronger (which lasts all of about 1 minute of screen time). This makes the film boring and it lacks suspense as you know that nothing can happen to her.<br/><br/>There are several scenes where people (men, of course) artificially tell her it's too dangerous for her to go somewhere / do something and you have to wonder why, as she is invulnerable to everything. No tension.<br/><br/>2. The movie is extremely tasteless. The first World War was one of the most horrendous conflicts in human history, yet here Wonder Woman just strolls across No-Man's land deflecting machine gun and sniper fire without getting a scratch and single-handedly defeats any German soldier unfortunate enough to cross paths with her. Of course the allied soldiers then run after her and win the battle without taking any casualties. Completely disrespectful and it trivialises the war of attrition that was trench warfare in which so many millions died.<br/><br/>3. The writers appear to have confused WW1 and WW2. The German soldiers are all dressed and act like Nazi's.<br/><br/>4. One of the main characters commits suicide seemingly for the sheer joy of it.<br/><br/>5. Dialogue inspired by Moana, I'm not kidding (""I am ... from ... and I have come here to ..."").<br/><br/>6. Physics are thrown out of the window. For example a lot of the CGI lacks ""weight"" when showing people or objects hurtling through the air, and Wonder Woman strolls about at one point with a heavy sword slid down the back of an evening dress at a party (which incidentally, nobody actually notices and remarks upon).<br/><br/>7. It's about 20 minutes too long and starts to drag towards the end.<br/><br/>8. Luckily for the heroes that aren't Wonder Woman, the enemy soldiers can only aim when shooting at Wonder Woman (where all the bullets bounce straight off, see above). When shooting at any other participant of the movie's fellowship, they have the marksmanship of Storm Troopers from Star Wars. The good guys of course have perfect aim.<br/><br/>9. Comedy-Villain German General randomly murders own officers for a laugh and nobody blinks an eye-lid.<br/><br/>As I said at the start, it certainly does look pretty, so if all you want is some eye candy with lots of explosions for 2.5 hours, go for it. For everybody else though, it's just a bad comic book movie. There's basically nothing redeeming here."

","The movie is everything people were expecting from DC. If like me you hated Batman v Superman, Man of Steel and Suicide Squad, then don't worry because Wonder Woman is gonna make the DC cinematic universe great again.<br/><br/>I did not want to get too excited for this movie considering the disasters DC had released, but after seeing the trailers I got more and more excited. I would not say that I am a marvel fan, but so far I enjoy some of the movies of Marvel like: Doctor Strange or The Avengers 1 or Iron Man 1, whereas the DC movies were just dull and slow for me since Zach Snyder took over. This wonder woman movie however was different, this one was actually good, which coincidentally was not directed by Zach Snyder. <br/><br/>Things I loved:<br/><br/><ul><li>Color: I love that DC finally used colourful colours for once. One of the main problems of man of steel and BvS is the freaking color which is so dull and grim, it just doesn't fit in Superman movies at all. Please Zach Snyder stop making Superman movies grim and depressing with the color. Just stop it. It only works for Batman, but not for the rest of the justice league. So please, don't make justice league grim and dull, you still have chance to bring color on it in post production. Please. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Music: Even though this time Hans Zimmer did not compose the soundtrack, the new guy used some parts of Hans Zimmer's wonderwoman theme and then added his personal touch, which suited the movie very well.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The pace of the story: The movie is long, but it doesn't feel long, something that only the best movies manage to accomplish such as lord of the rings. I did not feel like they were dragging the story with useless elements or anything, if anything some humour which was all right and not overdone.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The actual story: The story is about how Diane came to be who she is, what her purpose in life is, how she managed to be such a badass, how she took part in World War 1 to win the war and what she learn about the world of men. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Wonder Woman is balanced: She is not ultra perfect like i thought she would be, she is quite naive about the world, while she can kick your ass easily, she is still not as smart as Bruce Wayne, maybe she will get smarter over time in future movies as she gets to know more about the world. But personally i like that she wasn't a complete perfect girl who can do absolutely everything right. She is idealistic, a bit naive, very strong and independent, also sweet and caring, compassion, feminine... </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It is not a man hating movie: So i was a bit worry about this movie possibly being a man hating movie, at the beginning it feels like its going there, about how all men are evil and do not deserve wonder woman, but thanks to Chris Pine character, she sees the good in men, and that while they are not perfect doesn't mean they are all bad. Wonder Woman does not hate men. She wont make you feel like you are a rapist or a criminal just because you are a man. Wonder woman choses to believe in good thanks to the Steve Trevor.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Fight scenes: They were cool, what can i say? She actually can fight in a badass way, it reminded me of Captain America The Winter Soldier, but even cooler. She is fast, she knows martial arts, and a firm believer in the American way values. Justice, A better world, and all that stuff that the Americans claimed to believe in apparently. Her will to save innocent lives reminds me of Christopher Reeve's first Superman movie. It is inspiring, which is a breath of fresh air for superhero movies, since it seems that all superhero movies today do anything but save people. Zach Snyder movies just destroy entire cities all the time, and the Avengers pretty much do the same everywhere they go. It is nice to see that Wonder Woman's main concern is saving innocent people., since after all, isn't that what superheroes are supposed to do?</li></ul><br/><br/>Things that could be improved:<br/><br/>Slow motion: While there were moments in which the slow motion was cool, sometimes it felt a bit to much. Sometimes it felt like they were trying too hard to make Wonder Woman even more cool that she already is. I think some shots would have looked better if they just let the scene flow without those little moments with slow motion, but its not that big of a deal anyways.<br/><br/>CGI at the 3rd act: The first act and the second act were super close to total perfection, something i had not seen in a movie in a long time, the problem comes in the 3rd act and you can tell this is Zach Snyder doing as a producer in this movie. The villain in the movie is just the typical cliché CGI villain. It isn't a memorable villain like the Joker or Bane or Loki...<br/><br/>Gal Gadot acting: She is not the greatest actress the world has ever seen, but she definitely looks like WonderWoman.Her acting is not to great she has room for improvement there, but overall it doesn't affect the movie at all, and you are more focused on the story and the cool scenes and the dialogues with Chris Pine, Robin Wright than the acting of Gal Gadot."

"willShouldDid","1","12","29","17 June 2017"," Huge let down... Want my time back.
","First time ever I slept due to boredom. Not for long so I think I'm still eligible for this review. Overall, I hated this movie.<br/><br/>1. Pretentious island characters due to lack of character development: A word from someone can change some lifelong decisions of another out of blue.<br/><br/>2. I can't believe WWI should be dragged into this movie with such a naïve way of storytelling. It's despicable. It's disrespect. <br/><br/>3. True, the protagonist is out-worldly, a semi-god, and whatnot., her innocent/naïve way of thinking and behavior was so over the top and thus annoying. Is the target audience 8 year old who learns to integrate into society? Other than that I see no possibility of resonation.<br/><br/>4. General lacking in convincibility. The war buddies don't have near enough characters, and the only reason for the protagonist to win is herself, her indestructible body, and her realization of love? ... Duh... No, it's her indestructible body.<br/><br/>5. Improper fashion show all of a sudden when the woman tries out new clothes in front of a mirror. I've seen exactly that scene in __Mannequin II: On the move__, and that was a more entertaining movie than this.<br/><br/>5. Mediocre fight scenes. In first half, it was kungfu fighting with bullets reflected and 'cool' postures. I never could hypnotize myself into believing that woman could break into a wall in only bras and such. Neither could I refrain from thinking a single shield is the sole functioning thing to protect her from damage when the bullet barrage rained on her in the battlefield. Come on, some bare part of her body must have taken the hit.<br/><br/>I honestly regret my time wasted for this movie. And only since these few days have I spotted some honest (imo) reviews here. I'm pretty damn sure the initial general good reviews (or super hype train) was just propaganda. Shame on the movie industry for bribery!"

"imogenlucysmith","5","12","29","2 June 2017"," Only go if you want to see good action cinematography
","The film does its job of setting up the backstory of Wonder Woman but it shouldn't be receiving as much praise as it is getting. <br/><br/>At the start, you get back story of her and the world the universe is in but if you are a good listener and use logic, you will know something is amiss and you get frustrated at Diana for not figuring it out for herself, this casts a bad shadow over the rest of the film in my opinion as I had that as a constant nagging thought. Which also ruined the 'plot twist'.<br/><br/>The cinematography for the action was the main good thing for me. They slowed it down so you can see the punches make contact and it isn't flurried random action. However, the permanent gray filter after leaving the Amazonians Island can make it difficult to see at times. However, I have one major complaint in relation to the action. You see people get shot and stabbed but there is no blood whatsoever. People are mortally wounded and killed by guns but there is no wounds or blood. Diana tries to put pressure on a wound of a friend that doesn't exist and when she removes her hand it isn't bloodied.<br/><br/>This issue makes the film extremely unrealistic despite it trying to be gritty and realistic.<br/><br/>Also, it isn't reassuring that at my screening, people were not laughing at the 'comedy moments'(which if you like cringey awkward misunderstanding humour you will love it) but they were instead laughing at what were meant to be serious scenes. <br/><br/>Besides the action scenes, it was just okay. I personally did not end up invested in the romance or any of the characters and it wasn't funny when it was trying to be. <br/><br/>Just go watch Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2."
"ngkos","6","12","29","31 May 2017"," A roller coaster of a movie, not in a good way
","First of all, I'd like to point out that I have done reviews before and therefore, rest assured that I am not a bot, which now made me suspicious of all the good reviews that have been written for this movie prior to its worldwide release. This movie is a hot mess. I went in with high expectations after reading all the reviews praising this movie. At the end of the first act (you'll know which one I'm talking about when you see the movie), it felt that the movie should have stopped right there and probably leave Ares to a sequel or something. But no, it slowed down and then moved on to the next villain. And when you think it's over, another villain slapped you in the face and made me think, ""oh yeah, there's another one that they haven't addressed yet"". In total, this movie has 3 climaxes, all arguably equal in terms of power and and at the end of the movie, it is similar to the feeling of stepping off a nauseating roller coaster ride with dramatically steep ups and downs in terms of the pacing of the movie. I would also like to point out that I am not a comic book reader but an avid moviegoer and therefore, no... I am not a Marvel fanboy which many people would say biased my opinion. I want to go to a movie to feel entertained and sorry to say, this movie did not entertain me."
"Tjmatt90","10","12","29","30 May 2017"," It's surprisingly good!
","I went into this movie with little to no expectations. Without knowing I was in for a surprise. This movie blew me away. Gal Gadot has officially won me over, I remember when they first cast her and I was a little skeptical because not only was she skinny, but she didn't really have any major acting roles other than being in a couple Fast and Furious movies. But, she bulked up and really took this role seriously. Chris Pine was also amazing as well. I just can't seem to find anything negative about this movie."
"ahmedeldeeb","2","6","12","13 February 2020"," Boring, expected, Cliche' and overall not worth watching
","The movie doesn't add anything to the DC universe, if you are a fan of Nolan's trilogy and how he rebooted the character in a way or another you'd get bored of this plain acting and boring one.
The first scenes with the Amazonian have poor graphics, to my taste at least, later on the cliche' of a man hero who falls by chance to her island and she falls in love with, again!!! Haven't we seen that theme thousands of times? A reverse Pocahontas style storyline.
Going to the city where everyone is charmed about her, then she has this lethal weapon of banging her wrist bands to destroy others but she uses that very late.
I found it very boring and even tried two times to watch it maybe I'm missing something for all the propaganda it took, but honestly nothing. I've lived Hathaway's catwoman performance more.
If I'd present a female superhero and I'd be keen really on showing the female real powers and to best do that I'd get an actress that knows how to act."

"TwomeyLord","1","6","12","14 May 2018"," Great idea. Crappy execution. This is the absolute worst.
","I'm sorry, DC, but, no. Just no.
 
As far as the superhero genre goes, this definitely takes 'Batman and Robin''s place as the worst. I get why they made this the way they did, but since they put it in a series geared towards boys, they should've tried to make it appeal to both genders, and not just girls. The movie opens when young Diana is being trained by her aunt, Antiope, despite her mother, Queen Hyppolyta's wishes, because she and her deadbeat sister obviously know something the audience doesn't. So one day, a British air force soldier who for some reason has an american accent washes up on the beach, and brings about 50 German soldiers with him, and there is a 3 minute long fight scene, in which auntie Antiope takes a bullet for Diana. After the fight, Col. Steve Rogers-sorry, Trevor, tells the Amazons about World War 1. So Diana and Steve not-Rogers go to kill Ares, the Greek god of war, who Diana has a hunch started the war to end humanity. <br/><br/>I'm serious, this whole plot is set up on the basis of a hunch. That's strike one. I'll list everything else here-<br/><br/>2: Ares tells Diana that ""Only a god can kill a god."" If that's so, doesn't that mean Antiope killed herself for no good reason? Or is Diana a demigod, since only one of her parents-Zeus-is a god? If that's so then how does Diana kill Ares?<br/><br/>3: When Captain not-America lands his dumb plane in the water, how does Dr. Poison's book of evil not get ruined?<br/><br/>4: If Zeus died not defeating Ares, how did he give Queen Hippopotamus a baby? And why did Diana never ask this?<br/><br/>5: How do the Amazons reproduce if they have no men? And why do they have a book about sex? What the hell DC? I want to know!!<br/><br/>6: Diana says ""Love can save the world"", after getting mad at the British war council for wanting to solve the war peacefully? Also she doesn't even use love to kill Ares. She uses the power of ripping off ""Thor: Ragnarok"".<br/><br/>7: Why does she need a bullet-proof shield if she has bullet-proof bracelets? Also, what are those things made of that they can block bullets? Did the Amazons go to war with Wakanda and take some Vibranium?<br/><br/>8: Why did Marvel Studios not sue DC for ripping off ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and ""Thor: Ragnarok""? Was it because this monstrosity came out first?<br/><br/>9: Yes, this movie is a complete 'Captain America' ripoff, The war setting, the team of rag-tag soldiers, the superhero who still exists in the 21st century, the evil German science division, and the ancient artifact that's most likely to appear in a later movie.<br/><br/>10: The biggest editing mistake. Wonder Woman confronts Ares, and reaches for her sword only to find she has left it on the roof. Then after cutting to and from a short scene with Steve Trevor, she magically has it in her hand. How? This movie sucks.<br/><br/>11: What exactly is Trevor's nationality? He has an American accent, but he works for the British government. Is he a spy sent to them from America? Then why didn't the American Government send him to infiltrate-oh, who cares at this point?
 
For the final verdict, Wonder Woman is bleak, hypocritic, and full of plot-holes, editing mistakes, and cliches. It is the worst. Unless you plan on watching 'Justice League', just skip this, and get 'The Greatest Showman' or 'Dunkirk'."
"Turfseer","4","6","12","8 May 2018"," Mythology and World War I setting are pluses, but Wonder Woman's exploits add up to puerile wish fulfillment
","When Wonder Woman came out, it was touted as a ""higher class"" action hero film. Indeed, right away we're introduced to a narrative infused with mythology, where Amazon warriors created by Zeus are entrusted to protect all mankind. Diana (never referred to ""Wonder Woman"" during the film), is the daughter of Hippolyta, and she and her fellow Amazonians live on a secluded island, training to eventually confront the God of War, Ares, who is held responsible for all the wars propagated by an evil mankind, fallen from grace after their initial emergence in paradise.<br/><br/>What Wonder Woman also has going for it is the World War I setting-Diana's leading man is American pilot Captain Steve Trevor who ends up on the Amazons' island, after his plane is shot down by the Germans. The setting of ""the war to end all wars"" is appropriate as many of the battles ended up in stalemates, highlighted by pointless trench warfare, leading to massive casualties. Later it's Ares who tells Diana that he was only a passive onlooker to all the carnage. It's men themselves who are responsible for all the perfidy. And what better illustration is the conflict, initially entitled ""The Great War,"" which perhaps represents mankind's greatest folly.<br/><br/>While Ares remains Diana's primary antagonist in the narrative, the Germans, represented by real-life World War I general, Erich Luddendorf and a nasty chemist, Isabel Maru, are the primary villains on the earthly plane. It's Maru who's developed some new kind of poison gas that threatens to turn the war in favor of the Germans and Diana, Trevor and a motley crew assembled by Trevor, must stop them.<br/><br/>Act 2 of Wonder Woman is unfortunately rather puerile as the idea of a woman with supernatural powers proves to be wish fulfillment for deluded feminists and their male enablers. Maybe kids might be impressed by all the histrionics, but when Diana manages to wipe out an entire German regiment and successfully liberates a besieged French town singlehandedly, one can only laugh at the stupidity of such a concept.<br/><br/>At a certain point, Luddendorf is able to release Maru's gas, killing many in another French town, and Diana takes revenge, killing the brutal general (in real-life, Luddendorf did not die in World War I, and lived until 1937!). Meanwhile Trevor and his team blow up Maru's laboratory. Soon Trevor successfully highjacks the bomber loaded with poison gas which Luddendorf had ordered dropped on London. <br/><br/>The plot has two twists: Trevor must sacrifice himself to get rid of the gas and Ares is revealed to be Sir Patrick Morgan, the British politician who was trying to arrange an armistice between the warring parties. I suppose the writers get some credit for these twists but Diana's final confrontation with Ares proves to be anti-climactic, as we've already suffered through enough unrelenting gore.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot as Diana is eye candy for presumably a majority male audience and must be applauded for the very good shape she's in. Nonetheless Gadot does not have the requisite warmth to end up as an iconic, endearing character. More successful is the handsome Chris Pine, best known for his work as James T. Kirk on the Star Trek reboot. Special mention must be given to David Thewlis as Ares. He reminds me of the late Alan Rickman, who was a natural playing complicated antagonists. <br/><br/>Watch Wonder Woman for the production design and a few good performances. But in the end, it's really just another comic book action flick detached from the historical verisimilitude it attempts to impart."

"trevor-82944","4","18","48","2 June 2017"," All Sexes are Equal, But Some More So Than Others
","Attention girls, women, and Hillary supporters, you finally get your chance to enjoy the most popular movie genre as we step into summer. We already know the usual men's enjoyment concept from the comic book movie, where Batman fights Superman, or Captain America fights Iron Man, or Harley Quinn flaunts a sparkling tight thong. Now, a female superhero stars in her own female-directed movie, in armor built to expose her arms, legs, face, and shoulders!<br/><br/>Does Wonder Woman automatically pass as certified fresh? Is it considered sexist to criticize a movie by a female director? No, and no.<br/><br/>The first few moments progress with the velocity of a tuckered-out tortoise. It begins with our hero, Diana, remembering her childhood, when she felt inspired to fight for her fellow female warriors on their Zeus-created island. This repetitious, slow prologue only establishes facts that later get repeated.<br/><br/>Things still start off rather slow in the first act, but women may love the immediate role reversal to give them well overdue credit. Right away Diana rescues a man from drowning, following a fight between the united Amazon women and a technologically advanced German army. These battles look less like the usual fan service kind of write-in, and more a choreographed ballet of steel mesh fit for the most committed of DC followers. The male viewers will offer praise as well, such as key scenes which tribute all the classics of guy's-night-in cinema, and a direct connection to Wayne Enterprises.<br/><br/>The DC Universe could finally find its footing, yet improvement advances just by a hair compared to the loathed predecessors of the cinematic universe. The more forgetful characters here contribute nothing important, both in writing and direction, making the world around them equally shallow in cinematic exploration. The most accurate Greek mythology fact stated here is the women's birth origins from clay. Oh, and the island somehow coexists with the rest of the world, only accessible by a portal. It seems DC's cinematic universe cannot decide on its own reality.<br/><br/>However, both the theme and artistry picks up from here. As the pilot/spy takes her from her home into civilization, he teaches her about his way of living as she arrives in London. The detail of her unfamiliarity parallels any immigrant arriving in a new home. As Diana takes on the city, fine dresses interfere with her ability to fight. She refuses to accept society's standards of being a lady, nor does she tolerate their form of government. From her experience, good generals fight amongst their other soldiers rather than sit in offices. She cleaves against her sword and shield, and sees the contradicting wide lacy indigo dresses as a straightjacket to her destiny. So, we can conclude one applicable takeaway: women empowerment means showing lots of skin. Does that also give women the right to sexualize their wardrobe along with practicing brute strength? Celebrating sexual freedom should never be a sign of fighting for others.<br/><br/>Outside of the Israeli-Aztec heroine, the characters either hit or miss your memory as they come. Her spy/boyfriend works alongside a trio of soldiers who each voice strong opinions about bringing a woman on the battlefield with them. The first, a Moroccan, adds needed male flavor with his zesty interaction with the female hero. The other contributes sympathy as he generates a needed soul on the piano. The third, named ""Chief,"" gives a great backstory to America for Diana's understanding. Outside of the heroes, a great female villain, addressed as Dr. Poison, compels your curiosity of her backstory thanks to her hazy performance behind a secretive phantom mask. So what went wrong here? Their accents resemble two days' worth of dialect classes rather than someone who breathes the culture. If these American films continue to misrepresent other cultures, why bother attempting to please an international audience? After all, no one can buy into a Greek island of Amazon woman descended from Israel, Britain, and Africa.<br/><br/>By the time the third act rolls into play, the drama declines as you come to realize how little puts Diana in a real mode of conflict. The surround sound sure enough shakes your seat, but the male villain she confronts belongs in Marvel's long index of forgetful final bosses.<br/><br/>Should this define 21st century feminism? Should we celebrate making women feel empowered by blaming their problems on men? Wonder Woman focuses on painting women as the only true saints in the world, whilst all the men cause the world's problems. Ever heard of Aileen Wuornos? Whose biopic starring Charlize Theron was also directed by Patty Jenkins? Was she not responsible for all sorts of problems? Men are not the sole blame for chaos, pride is; which everyone who has ever lived and ever will live falls short of."

","I don't even know where to start ripping this movie to shreds. I'm a fan of all the Marvel series, but this is just a slap in the face to all the fans. How it got above a 5 on IMDb is beyond me.<br/><br/>1) The plot. Just dumb. 2) The A-team. What was their purpose? Comical relief? WW did everything herself. They were introduced with the assumption that each had some special skill that they can contribute. If terrible singing and hitting on women is a skill, any average drunk could have been part of this team. And what the hell is up with the Indian? He's the whitest Indian I've ever seen. 3) Lazy script writing. At one scene WW loses her sword. Next scene she has the sword while Aries patiently waited for her to retrieve it. Seriously? 4) Why did Steve need to fly the plane at the end to blow it and himself up? They could have just blown it up where it was to begin with. No need to sacrifice himself. As much destruction that Aries brought to that area, the extra explosion from the plane would not have made a difference. 5) For being super fighters, the Amazon women died pretty fast from bullets. So basically they have no special abilities and are just some hot women that can shoot arrows. 6) After Aries dies, everyone is hugging and the war is over. But we all know that there are plenty of other wars in the future. So that didn't make any sense at all. 7) The A-team was fighting a sniper and risked their lives to pick up and lift a heavy piece of metal to make WW jump in the air to destroy the enemy sniper. As much destruction as she can deal, she did not need their help to jump an extra two feet. 8) For being a god, Aries got his ass kicked by WW. The fight should have been more evenly matched. 9) Acting. WW is hot. That's it. She's a terrible actress in this movie. 10) For being a spy/government agency, they let WW walk into the discussion room without any identity check. They only reason they kicked her out was because she was a WOMAN! I mean WTF! 11) No blood. At any point. Getting stabbed, shot, sliced, blown up. No blood. The sword went through someone, no blood.<br/><br/>Overall this is just a turd of a movie with bad acting, terribly story, lazy script."

","Wonder Woman's first ever solo film is a home run for me. Due to stellar to good performances from the cast, - in particular the amazing chemistry between Gal Gadot & Chris Pine - I was there with the main characters all the way. Especially Wonder Woman/Diana is the one character we feel & support through the ordeal she & her company endure. She needs no reason to help any being, it is just who she is.<br/><br/>An already old tale is told in a very refreshing way, exactly what superhero movies needed. This film delivered supported by a strong emotional center, adequate humor & good action sequences.<br/><br/>This is not a superhero film, it is a FILM. A strong recommendation, I give no less of a reason to go see this movie!"

","So DC finally got it right, very much a Marvel-type production, actually one or two up on some recent Marvel works. Gal Gadot is one of the most strikingly beautiful actresses ever, when she's giving that head tilted down look to Pine in the hotel it's lights out. Maybe in part because of that (but only in part) she has chunks of what is known as screen presence, and she has it real big time. I wouldn't have guessed they would pick the end days of WWI for Wonder Woman's solo premier but it was all done right. Good pacing to the movie, maybe had 10 minutes more than they needed and a few of the things that happened didn't entirely make sense, but as an up close intro movie to the brunette Amazon she and it were a knockout."
"Aaron1375","9","7","15","28 June 2017"," Wonder Woman makes a wondrous debut on the big screen
","Wonder Woman is probably the best known female superhero, Marvel or DC. They made a television show featuring her back in the 70's starring Lynda Carter and was probably the first introductions of her to me as a child as well as the old Justice League cartoons they used to air all the time. A bit surprising that it took so long for her to be featured in a film, but not surprised by the success this movie is having as it was good. It also features a new character and I do believe that is another reason it has been successful. DC seems to be only good at getting Batman and Superman up onto the big screen. Granted, they did Green Lantern too, but I may have enjoyed that one a bit, most however turned their backs on it. I do not think though, that this is the best comic book film ever as some reviewers claim as I can think of many that I thought were better; however, this was a good one. Like a lot of films these days though, it did run a little long, but so many go over two hours. At least this one showcased the hero a lot more than other films. Watch a Transformers film and you get so much padding that is unnecessary while they shy away from showing any action, while this one has Diane battling rather early.<br/><br/>The story has a race of women known as Amazons living on an island that is hidden from the rest of the world. On it a young child resides whose mother is queen. Diane wants to learn how to fight, but her mother is a bit hesitant. The mother's sister convinces the mother that Diane needs to know how to fight and thus her training begins. When sparring she displays a power that seems more unnatural and powerful than even her fellow Amazons posses. A plane flies through the dome that hides the island and soon Diane learns of a war that is killing millions. She wishes to stop this war and goes with the pilot, Steve, to London where he assembles a rag tag group to try and find a chemicals weapon plant where a chemist known as Dr. Poison works to make a chemical weapon that will render gas masks useless. However, Diane's main goal is to find the god of war, Ares whom she believes responsible for the deadly war plaguing the world.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film as Gal Gadot does a good job as Wonder Woman/Diane. When she first arrives in London it is humorous watching her try and fit in and get clothes. Chris Pine does a nice job too playing essentially her love interest. The film also kept me guessing as to who the bad guy was going to be. I knew the one guy was too obvious, but in the end I did not figure out who it was until they revealed themselves.<br/><br/>So the film was good and it had more action than I was expecting as a couple of people I know almost made it sound like a chick flick or something. No, it is most certainly a comic book film, in fact I would compare it to another war time comic book film, Captain America. Only in this one you do have Diane's naivety of the world outside her island differentiating it from that film as well that this one was set during World War I rather than the second World War. I have enjoyed all the DC films thus far, unlike a lot of people. I thought Man of Steel, Suicide Squad were both really good and rank this one with those and all three are better than Batman versus Superman. I am only counting the ones in this new shared universe and not going back any further than Man of Steel. So good film, nice action and a wonderful start for the most well known female superhero."

","Recently we had had the pleasure of checking out Wonder Woman (2017) which I can say from the beginning was fairly entertaining. There is only one Item that I personally didn't like about the movie and that was the theme song and soundtrack but in no way does this reflect on how I feel about the movie itself.<br/><br/>I think for the most part Wonder Woman (2017) was well thought out and put together, the graphics were nicely done, the acting was as you'd expect, and the film as a whole was entertaining. There's nothing good nor bad to say about Wonder Woman (2017), it was the same layout from start to finish as basically every blockbuster film in the last few years. You can literally take this movie and watch Transformers, Ninja Turtles, and many others side by side and see the build up, effects, and all are on point; just change the actors and tweak the story a bit. So if you liked any of these films then you'll enjoy this one as it was very well entertaining.<br/><br/>The information about Wonder Woman's film layout doesn't reflect my opinion of the movie either, this has merely been the way movies are made; it's the copy and pastes efforts of the industry. Wonder Woman (2017) was a very enjoyable movie and it will be in our movie collection as it was as good as the preview made it seem."

","when i say its a First Success Female Superhero film in DC Comics because last time A Female Version (2004) Catwoman Superhero film that has flopped got worst The film grossed $82 million on a $100 million production budget, making it a box office bomb. but this got a very great success for a first female Superhero film, officially a box office hero looking at a $100.5 million domestic opening weekend got Huge Success thank god this film has not BOMBED. 93% Rotten Tomatoes great rating i am like jeez got very popular. and its a about time to<br/><br/>make a Wonder Woman big screen has happened i am like why could of they make a wonder woman film back in 10 years now its about time for a BIGGER film in big screen not a low budget or short film, and its a fast pace flick not a slow boring taking time story it moves on and on. its similar mix of another films not DC a similar staff like Captain America First Avenger and Thor first film just similar things to it if you seen these films you will get what i say. Chris Pine does a great job with his character he is really art of film Gal Gadot and Chris Pine has a great chemistry together, and its a female director Patty Jenkins about time knows how and know to make a Wonder Woman film. plot Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) Born and raised on the island of Themyscira, the child Diana dreams of becoming an Amazonian warrior. and it has a great motivation scenes to movie its pretty strong lines in film witch i love the script the way how its written great but its great that they didn't make her a b*tch around or crying out loud being annoying. she focus of her goals to be a Amazonian Warrior but scene doesn't so take<br/><br/>long it gets to point she has a hero inside her self. the island where they shot was very nice place Palinuro Italy. (Connie Nielsen)Queen Hippolyta, tells Diana that their people were enslaved by mankind, who were corrupted by the god of war Ares. Ares also slaughtered his fellow gods on Mount Olympus, including his father Zeus. Zeus manage to defeat Ares, but is mortally wounded. Before dying, Zeus created Themyscira and left behind a weapon (apparently in the form of a ceremonial sword) capable of killing his renegade son. Diana rescues pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) does a great job for his role he is good hes character is bit like Steve Rogers Captain America he could be great role to fit in if Chris Evans didn't wanted to be in it. after his plane crashes off the coast of Themyscira The island is soon attacked by the German soldiers pursuing Steve. German solders comes in island The Amazon solders decide to fight against German soldiers. Diana leaves her home to try to stop the war. with Steve Diana arms herself with the ceremonial sword and leaves Themyscira with Steve to find and destroy and Isabel Maru / Doctor Poison (Elena Anaya) A mad scientist who is<br/><br/>associated with General Ludendorff and specializes in chemistry and Elena Anaya poisons Ares. villains are Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) An ambitious and iron fisted general of the German Army during World War I he is eh i wish villains could be better the villain is pretty boring in my opinion i refer villain from First Captain America Red Skull Hugo Weaving character a lot more better Danny Huston character is bit weak villain. Ares (David Thewlis) is eh villain in my opinion is eh noting special, but the rest of film is fun Wonder woman does a lot of things a lot action a lot fun to movie. its never a slow boring pace film it moves on quicker that's how i should say it. and her costume is very well done i love her costume looks more realistic looks more of her Wonder Woman style of looks bit like metal amour but its not really of metal amour looking. its more realistic looking of costume, they is great scenes of wonder woman fighting against war and war Steve Trevor hires hes guys who fight war is Sameer (Saïd Taghmaoui), Charlie (Ewen Bremner), The Chief (Eugene Brave Rock) are great characters in film. and their is good action scenes Wonder Woman kicking German soldiers in butt great scenes. their is a lot strong Motivation that Gal Gadot says what she does her Motivation strong lines in movie her acting is great comes a surprise with her individual film. An incredible plot, entertaining from the first moment. Gal Gadot was born to play Wonder Woman, her performance was excellent, I love her! she does a great job as wonder woman. After the big surprise that gave Batman vs Superman film that includes wonder woman in her own movie. lucky film didn't fail at everyone but thank god it never failed<br/><br/>everyone and great success budget of film Batman vs superman works for me great but not for everyone but this may work on you better. better story and it has better direction to movie Gal Gadot Was BORN for this movie born for this role for wonder woman i think because they never made a big budget wonder woman film reason because they didn't want to hire a bad actress and lose budget and coast of film and that's why now its best time to make it with all Technology. the CGI explosions looked a bit fake and terrible to it like a low budget film Explosion looks but the film is still very well filmed and its great performance for gal Godot believe me if you really hated Batman vs Superman you will like this a lot more. 10 out 10"

","Yesterday afternoon, Diane and I attended a Hollywood remake of the old comic book hero, Wonder Woman. Diane and I, who usually agree on the worth of movies, thought very differently about this film.<br/><br/>I admit at the very beginning of this comment that I am an old codger who dislikes modern Hollywood productions. Diane wanted to go because Hollywood broke their age-old pattern of making male centered movies so I accompanied her against my better judgment because I loathe popular ""blockbuster"" movies and this turned out not to be an exception.<br/><br/>I also admit to falling asleep during the first part where Wonder Woman is growing up but then saw the second half where she fights in the First World War. The last 2/3rds that I saw were pretty bad; the war scenes were typical ""god guys beating up the bad guys"" that Hollywood seems unable to discard. I am sitting here shaking my head at those terrible war bits towards the completion of this bad movie. Please read the One Star comments because they said what I think except they write better than I and they remember the scenes far better than I.<br/><br/>I thought Gal Gadot who played the mature Wonder Woman was either directed badly or could not act well because the faces she pulled during the scenes in England and particularly during the battle scenes in France were Beyond the Pale. Admittedly she had terrible scripted scenes to work with and the Director should never have kept all of her close-ups. You can forgive all of these complaints but you cannot all of the Hollywood German-bashing in the second half of the film."

","DC's superhero movies have yet to disappoint - despite up until now being relentlessly targeted with negativity by a weirdly obsessive contingent of haters, fanboys, & critics on the Internet - this latest movie in the DC lineup no exception. DC movies really are modern mythology brought to life, aided by spectacular action visuals, coupled with epic music, these are the best movie experiences that the modern superhero genre has to offer.<br/><br/>This latest DC movie, Wonder Woman, keeps up with the exceptional quality of the preceding DC movies in all aspects. Wonder Woman's spectacular action scenes look and feel very much like the ones we've seen in Man of Steel & Batman V Superman - director Patty Jenkins impressively managed to maintain the same action style as action-genius director Zack Snyder did with his films. Wonder Woman's musical score achieves a similar beautiful, epic quality to the work of previous DC musical master-class level movie composers, Hans Zimmer, Junkie XL, etc.<br/><br/>I am thankful for DC movies taking themselves seriously and elevating themselves within a genre that can tend to be content with being merely shallow fluff entertainment. Wonder Woman, along with DC's other movies, prove that you can fully commit to bringing modern epics to life on screen."
"hollywoodhernandez-70868","10","12","30","4 June 2017"," Movie Review-Wonder Woman
","The new D.C. Comics movie franchise, Wonder Woman, benefits from a lot of good choices. First, the choice of Gal Gadot, a former member of the Israeli army, as the lead character. She's a martial artist. She's 5'10"" and a former fashion model who has great looks along with her athletic skills. She was born to play this role. Another excellent choice was the female director, Patty Jenkins. She portrays Wonder Woman as a ""feminine feminist"". Our hero is equal to any man in the movie but it's a subtle portrayal that doesn't beat you over the head. She's simply a strong woman. <br/><br/>In Wonder Woman, Diana/Wonder Woman is introduced as a young girl who starts early with her training as a defender of the all female island she was placed on, with an entire tribe of Amazonian women, by the gods. She becomes the best of the best after her years of combat training; surpassing even her teacher in her skills.<br/><br/>On the secluded island she had never seen a man before, until Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) drops in after his plane is shot down by German soldiers. When he tells her of the conflict that's killing thousands of people in the outside world (World War I) she decides, against her mother's wishes, that she must do something to help. So, together the two leave the island for a world that Diana knows nothing about and there are some hilarious situations that occur from her innocence with civilization in 1919 England. <br/><br/>While the movie is both funny and romantic, it's strongest element is its action scenes. Once Wonder Woman gets to fighting, forget about it, you can't take your eyes off of her up on the screen. The movie is a bit long (two hours and twenty one minutes) but I never noticed the length. There was plenty of excitement to keep you enthralled for every minute of the film.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman will reprise her role for (at least) two editions of The Justice League (which will also include more D.C. superheroes such as Batman, Superman and The Flash) and I'd bet on another Wonder Woman solo project as well. I thought Wonder Woman was wonderful! The movie is rated PG-13 and on my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" I rate it a JUMBO (with extra butter), my highest rating.<br/><br/>Hollywood Hernandez"

","Wonder Woman â€“ My review.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman has gotten a lot of accolades. It's the best reviewed DC universe movie of them all and rightly so â€“ since it's the best. In fact, I'd put it up there just below the Nolan Batman Trilogy. It's that good. First, the casting. All the main players and the minors are very good in their role. But Gal Gadot brings Princess Diana to life. She is at once a warrior, an innocent, full of heart and amazement. Her action scenes whether it's lasso, sword and shield or fists are great. She is one of the best representations of a superhero on film ever. Patty Jenkins has done a superb job bringing this movie to life. Chris Pine and Gal have great chemistry together. And Lucy Davis as Etta Candy is really fun. Can't have a Wonder Woman film without her sidekick. The story flows organically and moves very nicely. The editing is great and the WW1 sets are breath taking. Really, really great set design. But in the end, like any Superhero movie, it's the main character that carries it. Gal brings a sincerity and believability to the role and makes it hers. I'm already looking forward to WW2. Cheetah maybe?"

","Wonder Woman had a lot of pressure, as it's the first Live Action Film Debut for the 75 year old character & for a lot of fans & movie goers last chance for the DC Cinematic Universe (DCCU).<br/><br/>Wonder Woman tells the story of an Amazonian Princess & her adventures in man's world. It sounds bland & generic, but it's executed perfectly. <br/><br/>Gal Gadot portrays Wonder Woman in a way that makes her human. Gadot & Patty Jenkins (Director) bring out every scene, from the blood pumping action to the emotional & heart breaking. <br/><br/>Chris Pine's comedic timing & the chemistry between him & Gadot made us feel their relationship wasn't added because there's a female lead & it's a superhero film. <br/><br/>Every scene in the trailer that made your eyes open & smile like a child was just as jaw dropping as you want it to be on the big screen. <br/><br/>The cinematography was beautiful, the music is a big part of every superhero film. <br/><br/>Rupert Gregson-Williams, Composer, made a big part of the film. The already, almost, overwhelming scenes made the scenes explode with life & power. Every gun shot & missile explosion made the scene explode. The locations' had different scenes, from Themyscira to London, the atmosphere was felt almost immediately.<br/><br/>With Wonder Woman being set 100 years ago, this is the first ""proper"" standalone corner stone for the DCCU, there are hardly any tie-ins with other DC properties. It had humour, well-paced storytelling, not an overwhelming number of characters so we could get to know them, strong willed characters, both female & male. Beautiful sets from Themyscira, London & the War sets. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is engaging, heartfelt, fun, powerful & exactly what DC & Wonder Woman fans need."
"iamtherobotman","3","8","18","2 November 2017"," Not so wonderful
","So the hype surrounding this film over the last couple of years almost dictated this would be no good and on that score, it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>It starts off not too bad, with a bit of Backstory as to who this Amazon actually is and in the main it's good though he overbearing Mother is obnoxious in her protection of the young 'Diana' culminating in her almost repeating the same sentence to two different Amazons - To Paraphrase ""We can't train her, the stronger she gets the easier it will be for him to find her""...then...<br/><br/>""The more she knows about herself the easier it will be for him to find her""...Dumb Dumb Dumb!!!! So basically, just lock her up in a dungeon then and let her starve. Simple. That way ""he'll never find her"".<br/><br/>As soon as Pine enters the equation the film has lost. He's a terrible actor and on more than one occasion I found myself getting quite wound up at his constant intensity toward 'Diana'. He barely spoke a line, more throwing it at her or constantly talking over her in an attempt at reason. Never was he convincing.<br/><br/>So much sadly was wrong with this film and its a real shame because they could've made an excellent film from this. Others seem to think there was some 'Feminist agenda' going on, I never really picked that out as one of the flaws( It is Wonder Woman after all...). No, most of the flaws came in dialogue, it was all to schmaltzy, not feminist but definitely SJW-esque. Peace, Love, Love your enemies, treat them with kindness. This film definitely had an agenda to it, and it was all too obvious. Feminism wasn't one of them, as I say, it is Wonder Woman so she kind of has to be a strong female character and a strong female influence. I just felt we were being preached to on a Political level and I never enjoy that from Politicians, never mind film makers.<br/><br/>Love saves all apparently seems to be one message from this...Well, no, Love doesn't always conquer all and there is no point serving that up to naive kids who are already brainwashed by Liberal ideals.<br/><br/>Poor effort, and one best avoided in all honesty."
"m-88855","2","8","18","2 November 2017"," Well DC...
","So I watched Wonder Woman... Apart from the abysmal cgi, horribly cheesy script, sometimes questionable acting and a plot which seems to have some amazing similarities to the first Captain America film - a young, naive, wannabe soldier gets the chance to be the one to change everything. They take it and the opportunity arises for them to be the hero. They find that the bad guy has made a mass destruction weapon and they want to put a stop to it. The superhuman hero and superhuman bad guy fight and the good guy puts a stop to the evil plans of the bad guy. Huh... That's strange... That is the plot to captain America. But it's also the plot to wonder woman? How odd... Anyway, aside from all of that, it's better than what ever the f*** suicide squad was meant to be and it's also better than what I was pretty sure was a bondage porno between batman and superman in which the safety word was f****** Martha. So all in all, I'd say professor Lupin should probably stay in Harry Potter and leave the being a (Demi) God business to Thor ðŸ˜‚ Also, the characters are like one of those bad walking into a bar joke - a Scotsman, an Indian, an actor, a soldier and God walk into a bar. The Scotsman does f*** all, the Indian is a stereotype, the actor is a pervert, the soldier blows up and the God some how has a fight with some German officer whose punch stops about 4 inches short of her arm."

","Firstly, if you are going to create a historical-fiction movie based on Greek mythology, go study up on your facts. Even I, a 13 year old who read Rick Riordan's Greek Heroes book knows that the entire movie is based on a wrong fact. <br/><br/>*clears throat*<br/><br/>Queen Hippolyta is supposedly Ares' child, and Hippolyta later gave birth to Diana, which infers that Ares' is Diana's grandfather. The Amazonians were also one of Ares #1 worshipers, and have a huge shrine/festival dedicated just for him. Gods survive on people worshiping them,and that was what the Amazonians did;thus, it wouldn't make sense for Ares to get mad at the human kind because humans are what is keeping him alive. So either Ares is being an ignorant prat, or the movie directors got it wrong (option 2 is more likely to be true).<br/><br/>The Amazonians were known to be very violent, brutal and fierce which is the complete opposite of what they were depicted in the movies which makes me more annoyed, and I just want to tell the movie directors/script writers that if you're going to make a movie based on Greek mythology, read some Percy Jackson to check on your facts."

It's a journey as long as a Lord of the Rings episode, but which doesn't feel as arduous or elongated. 'Wonder Woman' is an action and adventure film masked as a romance and drama, soldering juxtaposed elements such as femininity and brevity with love and the sordid realities of world wars.<br/><br/>In the end, Diana must strip herself of all reservations and personal fears, and embrace her destiny fully, in order to overcome an unexpected foe and save humanity from its semi-self inflicted affliction.<br/><br/>'Wonder Woman' is a bold introduction to the super-heroine who is so important to the balance of the testosterone-driven male dominated cast of the Justice League that will set a precedent for DC Comics films at least for the next decade."
"aboddiest","9","8","18","15 June 2017"," She's still a wonder...
","I've never been the biggest fan of the Wonder Woman character, but I did enjoy a few episodes from the 1970's television series. Lynda Carter really left some big shoes to fill for her eventual successor, enter the recently released Wonder Woman film starring Gal Gadot and Chris Pine.<br/><br/>Gal plays a naive, yet strong and caring, Princess Diana of Themyscira effectively well, and Chris Pine's enactment of Steve Trevor undeniably adds on to some pleasingly convincing performances from the rest of the supporting cast in this picture.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a film that finds an effective balance between a darker and lighter tone, as we see Diana's ongoing growth throughout the course of the story. Some of Diana's fish-out-of-water moments even made me laugh a little. When Diana was having trouble adjusting to wearing such ""proper"" attire, I couldn't help but giggle at the awkwardness of her slight, yet still noticeable discomfort with the situation. With Diana, we have an individual who was born and raised on an island where there are no men. She clearly knows what a man is when she sees one, but she has never really interacted with one before. So, when Steve Trevor comes into the picture, Diana doesn't quite know what to make of him. I appreciated and felt completely convinced by the motivation and pure curiosity that drove Diana to leave her home and go with Steve to fight a war that her fellow Amazons considered a problem for man to solve on their own.<br/><br/>The interactions between Diana and Steve were the most touching to me, as I watched the strong connection between these two characters grow into an even stronger romance. This made it a bit harder to watch Steve sacrifice himself in the end. Although, his sacrifice was understandable, since it proved to be maybe the one thing that shaped Diana into becoming the hero that we all know she is in the present day.<br/><br/>As for the villains, Ares proved to be deceptively cunning, while Ludendorff and Doctor Poison proved to be clever, albeit unwitting pawns in Ares' attempt to prove that the human-race didn't deserve to exist. Yes, there was one point when Ludendorff and Doctor Poison got a little cheesy in a very 60's villain kind of way, but I was okay with that, since it was only for a very short moment. Besides, Ares' calculated planning and precision more than made up for whatever minor shortcomings any of the villains had in this film.<br/><br/>The fight scenes in this film, were as epic as I would have hoped, never losing my attention, even for a second as the movie progressed. I felt enough of an adrenaline rush from the action scenes alone for this movie's 2-hour and 21-minute run-time to feel more like a quick 90-minute action/adventure flick.<br/><br/>I also appreciated the Richard Donner's Superman moments in this film, as well, from Diana wearing glasses to the reversed bullet-blocking alley scene. It was real nice to see a strong female character portrayed as the hero, while the male lead was still seen as someone who could still carry handle himself well enough in a fight.<br/><br/>For its unrelenting ability to maintain a steadfast story and continuously developing lead characters, I give Wonder Woman a score of 9 out of 10. Despite it's very minor shortcomings, this movie did enough to keep me from wanting to take even one bathroom break, and for me, that's really saying something."
"DarkVulcan29","10","8","18","12 June 2017"," Gal Gadot was born to play Wonder Woman
","Gal Gadot has a lot in common with actors Christopher Reeve and Chris Hemsworth she has been in some stuff and but gained recognition when she played a comic book character, like Reeve(Superman) and Hemsworth(THOR). After her appearance in Batman v Superman, you had a feeling she would get her own solo movie, and now here it is.<br/><br/>The story takes during the time of World War 1, where Diane(Gal Gadot) was raised on the hidden Island Themyscira, to Amazon race. One day her life is turned upside down when a pilot named Steve Trevor(Chris Pine) comes crashing down on the Island. Diane saves his life, and decides to help him. and goes to America with him.<br/><br/>This was way better then Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad which I think where modest hits, Wonder Woman has a film really delivers, everything you would want in an origin story. Much has I liked Man of Steel, the more I watched it the flaws keep showing. Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman the character very well and not annoyingly one noted, when she comes into a new world, her situations are never played in a sitcom like way like it was in THOR. Chris Pine was good has Steve, she had Gadot have good chemistry, surprisingly . Action scenes are very well filmed, in a 300 like way. The World War 1 setting looks very realistic, and not just a set. At times he feels like those old war mission movies from the 60's. Everybody here shines as well. Makes me now looking forward to Justice League."

","We've seen Wonder Woman twice, both times with packed crowds, and I have to say that it is not only one of the 3-4 best DC comic films ever, but is in the top 7 or 8 of all the comic book films ever. Exciting, fast-paced, well-written and emotional, it builds all the relationships thoroughly through the first two acts with a great payoff in the end. I enjoyed Batman v Superman and thought Gal Gadot stole the show; that film was a sort of teaser trailer for this movie. She IS Wonder Woman, even to a guy who considered Linda Carter as WW for forty years. A great movie for the whole family and a return to prominence for DC."

Having grown up on the TV series, various cartoons starring the Amazing Amazon; especially the incredible Justice League animated series and feature films, I can say wholeheartedly that this is by far her best movie.<br/><br/>Raised as a princess on the fabled island of Themyscira, Diana sets out to be a hero among the world of man, which has been fraught with brutality, violence, and war. Will she succeed, or fail? When Gal Gadot was cast as the titular heroine, many doubted she could pull of the role; mainly due to not just acting, but also the physicality of it as for years, Wonder Woman has been depicted as tall, muscular, and voluptuous. Keep in mind, that was and is the comics version, but when she showed up in Bvs, everyone was BLOWN AWAY!! Not only is she physically capable in the role, but also bringing to it emotion, heart, vulnerability, and of course, good 'ol fashion asskicking.<br/><br/>Most of the other cast are really good in their roles. Chris Pine, David Thewlis, and Connie Nielson, all turn in great performances as Steve Trevor, Hippolyta,and Sir Patric respectfully. I really enjoyed the scenes set during World War 1, as the costumes and mannerisms, and weaponry are historically accurate. But like with any comic book movie, several liberties are taken, which is to be expected of the genre, but do nothing to dampen the overall experience. The only issues I can think of are certain scenes that have no explanation; especially when one of Diana's beloved friends meets an untimely demise, no scene of presenting the Lasso of Truth, and WW's iconic spin. Had those scenes been in the movie, it would've been really awesome; not only for paying homage to the comics, but the iconic TV series starring Lynda Carter as well.<br/><br/>Action, romance, humor, some touching moments, but still that rocket-fire fuel of comic book action is all here and there and the direction of Patty Jenkings really makes it come to life on the big screen. Wonder Woman is the best film starring the titular heroine we all know and love. Though it's a bummer we didn't get a end credits scene, the film's box-office success is more than assurance that this won't be the last we see of Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Go see this film. It's really good."
"joshuaiyer","9","8","18","7 June 2017"," A WONDERful Story - and a powerful soundtrack to back it!
","I've seen this film twice now, and I've really enjoyed it both times! While I'm going to exclusively focus on Rupert Gregson-Williams' soundtrack as I always do, I will say I did really enjoy the story â€“ the setting of World War I (London - and apparently Diana's in Paris now!) was a great one, with the old-timey photographer, and I thought the dynamic between Gal Gadot's Diana and Chris Pine's Steve was really well done. I liked Diana's costumes and throwbacks to both the comics and the 1970s TV show, but gone are the days of old - this Diana fit well with Batman and Superman last year, and holds her own on the big screen now.<br/><br/>Modern superhero scores aren't always my cup of tea. I definitely appreciate this music, and the way the orchestra is transformed into a cinematic sound. There were plenty of powerful moments in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), with Hans Zimmer's decidedly more ""gritty"" style â€“ something that worked for that film as it did for the Dark Knight trilogy back in 2005. Diana's film is different â€“ it's more personal to her, it's back before the 1920's, there's more emotion and heart in it as she's the heroine of the film. Rupert Gregson-Williams nailed this dynamic, keeping the score fresh and epic as a superhero film but also adding so many beautiful moments that sent chills through me both times I saw the film in the theatre. I think the brother of the composer of the Narnia films offered a wonderful score for Diana's personal adventure â€“ not very Romantic, but powerful in its own right. It was cool knowing they were brothers, because I can see influences from Narnia in this score as well at times.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's main theme for Diana, though, is particularly awesome, and Gregson-Williams uses to great effect in this film. From a recent interview, the composer discussed his use of writing a naÃ¯ve theme for the young Diana. In Batman v. Superman, she is already a strong warrior, and when she appears at that climactic final battle the electric guitar starts, and we immediately associate her with Zimmer's track. Throughout Wonder Woman, besides still using the heavy metal theme (in the same vein as Murray Gold uses ""I am the Doctor"") at the moments where Diana is at her finest and strongest. It's a great tune that definitely got stuck in my head at lunch after seeing the film. I'm definitely glad this was brought back, but what's really cool is how Gregson-Williams hints at this theme in his score. For example, the very first few notes of the film, E-G-B, and then the glissando down to the B-flat â€“ those are the exact notes for the guitar riff of Diana's epic theme we will hear much later on. This is done subtly at various times throughout the film like that, and it's really clever stuff. (The rest of that first track ""Amazons of Themsycira"" builds on that triad as a motif.)<br/><br/>The track ""Hell Hath No Fury"" has my favorite moment in the entire score, and perhaps the most powerful, and really helps solidify Diana as a new favorite for me. It begins with Diana getting struck down by Ares, and Steve comes up to her and begins speaking to her. At this point, we don't hear any of the dialogue, but then, as we see Steve taking the plane off, the combination of the wonderful emotion Pine pulled off with his face and the beautiful crescendo in the music builds his sacrifice. The crescendo has been in a steady b minor, and right when we see Diana watching the explosion high in the sky, the orchestra shifts to a beautiful and jaw- dropping g# minor, the strings playing higher and higher, and the music that follows is pure emotion as Diana runs in anger to get at Ares. I absolutely love musical shifts like that, and this music captured a perfect moment for me â€“ Diana fighting for justice based on love and compassion, and the shift in tonality represents Diana's shifting beliefs and thoughts about mankind â€“ she's now completely stepped into man's world to wait 100 years before she tells all this to Bruce in last year's filmÂ… <br/><br/>There was one interesting underscoring moment when Captain Kirk â€“ erm, I mean, Captain Steve was infiltrating the gala and speaking with Dr. Poison, and at the moment he saw Diana had came in, the music turned from light and cheery to dark. It's probably more indicating Steve's anger that his plan was messed up a bit, but it was an interesting moment I thought I'd share. Charlie's singing with him playing piano that accompanies Diana and Steve's dancing was a nice touch to the time period of the film. Lots of long, lush (those British composers!) strings chords to either intensify or add emotion to a scene - almost too much, and all with the same basic harmonic progressions, if I'm honest. <br/><br/>So those were some of my main thoughts on the film. I thought this was a really wonderful film, one I would be happy to watch again in the future. It also gets me very excited for the return of Wonder Woman in the Justice League. The film was an absolute joy to watch from beginning to end, and I can't wait to see where DC Comics takes this character and their others on the big screen (and their respective scores) next."
"arungeorge13","8","8","18","5 June 2017"," Review â€“ Wonder Woman (2017) .. Patty Jenkins / Gal Gadot film is a winner all the way! [+78%]
","If you are someone who'd been awaiting that one DCEU film which was going to undo all the shambles we'd seen from Warner Bros. post Nolan's Batman trilogy, look no further. This Gal Gadot standalone film delivers the goods, and in style. The central characters are well fleshed-out and their motives distinct (except, as usual, the anti-climactic villain!); there are a couple of amazingly executed set-pieces, the message on the (futile) essence of war delivered loud and clear; ultimately, the film is what one would call a game- changer for the DCEU.<br/><br/>As a viewer who constantly keeps track of the MCU and DCEU, shades of 'Thor' and 'Captain America: The First Avenger' were felt throughout. The story starts off at Themyscira, the home of the Amazon warriors, the landscape of which is pure eye-candy. Laden with lush green pastures and serene beaches, the kingdom is indeed a thing of beauty. Diana's origin story is partially established, she learns of the battle of the Gods and acquires martial skills as she makes steady progress in becoming a young warrior-princess herself.<br/><br/>The going gets dark once Pine's character (Capt. Steve Trevor) inevitably enters the scene. Determined to stop Ares (the God of War) who has presumably taken the form of German general Ludendorff, Diana agrees to assist Steve in his pursuit to end the war of all wars (WW I). The conversational exchanges between Diana and Steve are laced with enough humor and flamboyance for even the average viewer to let out a chuckle or two, lightening the tone to an extent all the while trying to remain consistent with the darker, more relevant theme of the film.<br/><br/>Predominantly a writer for television, scenarist Allan Heinberg does a marvellous job tying in the two universes with ease. Diana's coming-of-age (from a warrior princess to a Goddess in its truest sense!) is presented in an engaging yet insightful manner (based on a story by Snyder and Fuchs). Patty Jenkins (who helmed Charlize Theron's 'Monster') interestingly had to be the redeemer of the DCEU after BvS and Suicide Squad hit rock-bottom in terms of feedback, and she achieves what even the likes of Zack Snyder and David Ayer could not. She treats the material in hand with all earnestness, imparting the right amount of panache and cheer, as and when required (Snyder's stylistic touches are felt throughout, but added in right measure!).<br/><br/>And Gadot..the word is WOW. She's got ravishing looks, the physique of a warrior and brings to the forefront, the kind of innocent charm and confidence a superhero(ine) of her other-worldly universe is expected to exude. Her performance is indeed the film's strong- point. Pine does a neat job playing the role of her human-foil. The antagonist character though, is slightly underwritten (there's a twist that doesn't quite hit the mark!). The opening set-piece at the beach in Themyscira and the one that takes place at No-Man's- Land are exquisitely crafted. (P.S â€“ I got goosebumps every time Hans Zimmer/Junkie XL's WW theme started playing during set- pieces!). Rupert-Gregson Williams' (Hacksaw Ridge, The Legend of Tarzan) compositions hold well for the constantly evolving Diana. Cinematographer Mathew Jensen (F4, Chronicle) smartly captures the enticing vistas of Amalfi Coast, Italy for the initial portions and employs appropriate color tones to denote the change-in-universe (a good portion of the film is shot in limited light!). Costume and Art departments have done remarkable work. Last but not the least, the visual effects (save for the climax sequence!) are splendid.<br/><br/>They say a film that doesn't spoon-feed is more likely one that is bound to stay with the viewer for longer stretches. Wonder Woman, for sure, has set a benchmark for films in the DCEU and I sincerely wish 'Justice League' turns out to be a worthy follow-up. Kudos to Jenkins, Gadot and crew for hitting a home-run!"
"KATO-SUBZERO","9","8","18","4 June 2017"," Pretty Israeli actress, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, 2 Thumbs Up
","Saturday, 3 June 2017: I have been a fan of beautiful, sexy and talented Israeli actress Gal Gadot since seeing her in two ""Fast & Furious films. I used to watch the 70's t.v show, ""Wonder Woman"" with pretty actress Linda Carter. But Gal Gadot is Hot, oozing with sex appeal with her looks and Israeli accent and she is a strong woman at the same time. <br/><br/>I agree with one of the character's who is a friend and helper who says after watching Gal saying, ""I'm frighten and I am turned on at the same time."" Gal is the perfect choice to play ""Wonder Woman"", but if there was another choice for the role, the only actress I think would be just as good would be Israeli actress Moran Atias.<br/><br/>I liked everything about the film, but it did get a bit boring for a few minutes when she as Diana was in Germany waiting to reveal her true identity to the world. Once Diana takes charge and fights back the action is non stop and spot on.<br/><br/>One of the things I like best and I noticed is that the writer events in the Holy Bible to explain certain parts of the film. Near the beginning, we see Zeus creating humans in the world and there is only Love and good in the world. Then we see Zeus brother or perhaps his son who becomes jealous and filled with hate and wants to destroy all human kind. <br/><br/>When Chris Pine's character, Steve ask Diana about her father, Diana says, ""I never had a father. My mother created me from clay and Zeus breath life into me and made me who I am."" In the Holy Bible, God created the first human man, Adam from dirt and dust and breath life into man. Then Lucifer/Satan was kicked out of heaven and takes revenge on all humans. In the film, Diana talks about Love, but we also see that she has face the big bad devil/Satan known in the film as ""Aries"".<br/><br/>And near the end, we see that Satan raises his ugly head, but God's side will Always win. In the film, we see Gal Gadot defeating evil Satan character and restoring all love and kindness.<br/><br/>This film is well worth the money. I give it a nine on the scale to ten."
"rdongoodman","4","11","27","8 June 2017"," CGI was OK, but the rest? No no no ...
","CGI was all that was good in this film. Entertaining? Close, but not worth 2 hrs. The dialogue was atrocious, even though the acting was alright. The script? Crapping horrible. If you have nothing better to do and you can't find it online for free, then waste your hard earned cash and pay for the crap. It's good enough if you need to pass the the time while your worthless life has nothing else to offer."
"socrates99","9","11","27","2 June 2017"," If I were an actress hoping to outdo Gal Gadot as WW, I'd forget it
","In a lot of ways, this is not that special a movie. For my money the best scene comes early and it's a battle scene where the Amazons take on WW1 Germans. Thing is that scene includes some of the most beautiful imaginations of women in battle I've ever seen. That took actors able to place their bodies in some very athletic positions. The last time I saw something comparable was with Brad Pitt in Troy when he takes on some Trojan champion.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot doesn't really share in that wonderful first battle scene, but she's so captivating and right for the part, it's a pleasure to see her carry on in the rest of it. Women aren't easy to portray as warriors but this movie manages to pull it off. And that's doubly impressive since the director's a woman.<br/><br/>The movie does lose a little of its magic near the end, but is well worth your time."

","This movie is Awesome. It has a little bit of everything. Action, comedy, and romance. Gal Gadot is charming, beautiful, but above all a badass warrior. Chris Pine is solid in his role. The fights scenes are great and the soundtrack chosen plays perfectly. It is a much needed shot in the arm for DC and hopefully a springboard for the rest of the DC universe. I look forward to watching it again soon. Obw marvel fanboys need to stop trolling DC movie's because it's getting old and pathetic."

"jc-29071","Null","9","21","12 June 2017"," Wonderful!
","Just want to mention that there were many changes, but many for the best, the movies was good and the action sequences great, there was some comparison to Captain America however lets squash that right away, Wonder Woman was around long before Capt. America and its the other way around actually, just research the comics and you'll discover the truth, its just that the Captains movie came out before Wonder Woman. But there are some good messages which we all should listen to especially about war. Look forward to Justice League and WW part II this should be very interesting. One final mention Wonder Woman should be more caring and gentle, also a role with Linda Carter as a mentor would be fantastic! I would love to see her, we still love you Linda Speaking about Justice League: Green Lantern must be in the Justice League Movie, even if he makes a late entry at the end of the film for a quick save or to give a last minute assist, he is a founding member, we're talking the original, Hal Jordan. Either ask Ryan Reynolds and Martin Campbell to proceed with part II of Green Lantern Corps movie (the movie was great in my opinion) or just get another actor like Armie Hammer, someone new who looks like a leader, or Jason Bateman and start filming already, okay. Or get another actor, think a young Kevin Costner, whoever he is he must imbue knightly virtues and spirit, a good person. What went wrong in the first film: He should not ride in a car on a track like he did in the film, he is not a kid. He could have just rode in a super hot Mursiellago or Lamborgini or the Bugatti Veyron the 2 million dollar car and that would have been fantastic, see what I mean guys, come on. But hey I loved the green lantern movie minus the mentioned, just make sure he looks cool and is a good guy, strong, leader. Also please keep Blake Lively she was great and as a supporting character and Mark Strong as Sinestro also bring her back Angela Bassett. What went right in the first movie he uses a futuristic machine gun to shoot the evil Elder at the end, he also flies, has a force field, shoots blast out of the ring, and throws giant heavy objects at his opponents all excellent, well done. He could have a green body armor of types, huge and throw all sort of things like a garbage truck, an oncoming train, giant blocks the size of building, and have the green aura / force field show us it also allows him superhuman strength to lift buses, punch falling boulders to smithereens etc., The Lantern rocks, he also happens to be the king of Green as since he doesn't have to destroy any property when he throws things around since they are made from his ring, there is no damage to the environment. I imagine he and Aquaman have a good relationship because of this and because he is like a knight. This is visually spectacular stuff and extremely impressive. Also you must bring Sinestro and the green lantern corps, just make them look better and stay away from some of the chicken aliens yeesh! also Killowag should look better more impressive, bigger, like the thing but not as big as the hulk."
"gravflab","10","9","21","7 June 2017"," An absolute blast
","I don't think I have ever been as pleased with any DC movie, as I was yesterday watching Wonder Woman. It is such an interesting universe, and throughout a brilliant story with a brilliant cast. Gal Gadot is the embodiment of Wonder Woman and I believe she represent her so so well. On another note, a thing I have always seen as a problem with DC movies, is the annoying slow motion, taking basically everything good out of a fight, because it is in slow motion every third second. This is the first movie where they did not overdue it, and I am so thankful for that. Minimalistic and raw. It is so strong and so cool when she demonstrates just why she is one of the best fighters in the DC universe- especially when she decides to throw a massive tank. The short moment in Batman vs Superman *evidently also the best part of that film* was nothing compared. Watch it, watch it, watch it and enjoy that Wonder Woman has finally reached the big screen and sit back and relax watching the one origin story, DC for some reason, never bothered much with. I'm not saying they are suddenly better than Marvel- but damn, they just took a giant leap forward in the competition"

Gal has a great physics for the character, but I wasn't sure if she was poor actor or dialog is terrible.<br/><br/>If you have some knowledge of WWI, your brain would have hard time to adapt and let you enjoy the movie.

Honestly,the film is Overrated, maybe is because gender issues i don't know they keep saying ""best film that was Directed by a woman"" don't really get that.

"blueclementinex","6","12","31","31 May 2017"," BIG improvement at the DCEU movies...
","When i first walk into the theater to watch this movie, i don't have that much of a high expectation. I'm pretty much avoiding a mistake that i already have made back then when i watched batman v superman: dawn of justice and suicide squad , and yet left me disappointed. but wonder woman is actually pretty good!<br/><br/>I think DC evolve much, i think they learn from their previous mistake that they make such serious, dark, but unenjoyable movie. i could see how much effort to make Wonder woman to have dark serious tone yet still being enjoyable, heart warming, and pretty funny . i still have my comments though, on this matter which i will discuss later. The characters itself are very interesting. before i watched the film, i thought that the character wonder woman is going to be a marry sue (a character who doesn't face any challenges and is good at anything, which i despise). but, thankfully, she doesn't. wonder woman a.k.a Diana has her strengths that make her stands out, yet also has weaknesses that sometimes push her away from achieving her goals in the movie, which makes a good main character development. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine might me the highlight of the movie since i think without their chemistry and also performance the movie wouldn't be as well as it is. their relationship in the film, although a bit cheesy, is what makes the movie more realistic and emotional. the fight scenes are also very fun and action-packed. <br/><br/>However, This film's not a masterpiece. it still has things i didn't like and sometimes take me away from the movie. first, the humor. as i said before, i appreciate that DC tries to be more fun with light-hearted comedy, but sometimes i felt as if they stretch a joke too long, that turns chuckles into a cringe. like, OK we get it it's funny now can we move on? second, some lines are also very cheesy. third, pacing. sometimes i felt as if this movie is going too slow yet too fast at the same time. at times i would question a character's motivation because i didn't understand their character very well, which leads into the fourth, the story telling. i know how i mentioned how i love the way that diana and steve character's developed, but as they centered on both of them too much, they as if forget the side characters. side characters are not as important as the main characters but still has their own uses in the plot and the main character motives as well. i felt some characters are so pushed out and forced, that i'm not even feeling sympathetic towards them, which is pretty dull sometimes that i don't feel as emotional the movie wants me to be, and fifth and last, is the CGI. i don't have much to say on this, rather than it's pretty acceptable, but sometimes it takes me away from the movie a little. although, some landscape shots at the beginning of the movie showing themyscira is gorgeous and eye- candy. <br/><br/>in conclusion, even with its flaws, i recommend you to watch wonder woman, a movie i would hopefully call a kick-starter for great movies at DCEU at the future!"
"Avyrius","6","12","31","31 May 2017"," Satisfactory but nothing too special.
","If Batman vs Superman is a 5/10, this movie is a 6. Its somewhat a satisfactory beginning for Wonder Woman. The choreography is not as good as BvS and slow motion is too overused. The plot is.acceptable for a first movie and the settings like Themyscira and 20th century London are gorgeous.<br/><br/>Wonder woman 2017 is kinda an anime, with all the anime tropes applied when you actually think about it. Awkward sleepover episode, shopping episode, prom episode... with Steve as the average Joe anime protagonist and Diana the naivete powerful female protagonist.<br/><br/>It is worth watching over pirates 5 for sure."

","From the first scenes, we can see that a lot of money has been put in it. The scenes of fight are unrealistic, placed in an imaginary world, with expansive costumes. Besides the action that doesn´t make much sense as it is a lot of music and minimalist dialogues to explain the story, there is the acting that is pratically inexistant. I know that Robin Wright can act as I have seen her do a great job before. I cannot really judge here as she has a small part but she is ok (not great though). I have never seen the other actors in anything before so I cannot tell if it is the script, the direction that is making each scene so flat and predictable.
There are attempts of humoristic and romantic moments to give some depth to the story and the characters but it just doesn´t take.
I was often thinking of Captain America as it is also supposed to be set during the World War but it is not even close to having its charm. I immediately felt compation for Captain America and liked his relationship with Agent Carter. Here, I don´t even like Wonder Woman. No offence to the actress as I have never seen her in anything else. As for her love interest...I just don´t care. Again, no offence to the actor but it is too predictable that they will end together without really knowing why as none of the characters is of much interest.
I´m under the impression that it is one of these DC adaptions that is trying to bring people to the theatres except that they forgot the key element for any film: a soul.
It is watchable as long as you don´t pay attention to the many inconsistancies that I will not list here as it would take too long, even longer than the film."

The movie has its moments for humor with her lack of knowledge for the modern world, and I had plenty of laughs but I also shed a lot of tears as well. This movie is amazing, and I recommend it highly. The battle scene are a sight to see and it's overall enjoyable and fun to watch.

","I went in with low expectations, therefore I wasn't disappointed. However, if I were to have lent ear to all the reviews and commentaries, I would have been quite annoyed. This is NOT a good movie. I barely rate it average.<br/><br/>There were good parts in it, mainly the feminist aspects of the film. Diana is tough, but also a woman, with a strong personal and cultural desire to help, mend, love. Of course, it is taken to ridiculous heights and made completely worthless in the end, when she kills a bunch of people, but still, it was a refreshing, if badly implemented, point of view.<br/><br/>Other than that there is a lot of bad characterization, starting with the Amazons and Ares and ending with the three ""sidekicks"" that do almost nothing the entire movie. Even the villains are underused, in a movie that somehow managed to total over two hours. There are some scenes that should make the director cower in shame (see the ""they don't know that"" scene, ugh!) and some bad acting here and there.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is beautiful, but not an extremely talented actress. She did her best, though. Chris Pine played Captain Kirk, complete with motorcycle and the scene where he stops, thinks a little, then rides another way, plus the obligatory self sacrifice scene. I think it was some sort of tribute, but that part wasn't good in Star Trek either.<br/><br/>Bottom line: you can watch it just like you would a Batman or Superman movie and expect just as much. ""The savior of DC franchises"" is no worse or better than the things people called disasters before. It is not fun, merely time consuming."

","I didn't had big expectations after being disappointed by DC movies in the past, but it seems like, that DC has listened to the fans. What most post-man of steel movies did wrong was: character development. It was a crucial, but missing part. Until now.<br/><br/>The beginning explains in greater detail what the Amazonians do, their history and how Diana grew up.<br/><br/>It's a great mix of character development and action scenes with some interesting plot twists. The soundtrack is amazing and the main theme is introduced at the right time. Great looking cast with decent acting.<br/><br/>TL;DR: the second best (after man of steel) DC movie so far.

","""Wonder Woman"" is the answer to the DC universe's prayers. It focuses on telling a story without trying to be edgy/trendy. It takes its time to develop Diana, as well as the world around her. As the film progresses, you see her grow into the character she was destined to be as she breaks past her naive perspective on how the world and the humans within it work, and it was nice to see a basic super hero flick with some depth. Most of the action sequences are polished and entertaining, but sometimes they bring a touch of reality to a scene, and play an integral part to her growth. Sadly the climax turns into the usual, with a villain encounter that undermines what the film was trying to accomplish with his cheesy performance and light show of a battle. There were also drawn out jokes and scenes that wasted precious screen time, but it manages to end strong despite, and I still say it's a step in the right direction for the genre. It's time for less trends, and more good story telling."

"macakmak","3","11","28","8 June 2017"," Politically correct thing to do.
","To be honest , after checking review sites, i had great expectations for this movie. It crashed the lists and somehow managed to be the best rated DC movie of late. <br/><br/>For me, It was disappointing to say the least. Be aware that this review contains many SPOILERS and serious ranting from this point onward.<br/><br/>Starting from the beginning, the Amazons' (not Amazonians) costumes were unauthentic, they looked more like some alien culture rather than bronze age Greeks (well, they were not supposed to be Greeks but since they kinda worship/believe in Greek pantheon...) , and the story part was all too cliché, protective mother tries to protect her children from what awaits her. Some of the cast was spot on, but Wonder Woman looked like a super-model with thin lines among them. Every single line they spoke, you could've just guessed before it was spoken (and this is same for whole movie).<br/><br/>Filled with illogical things happening all around and dialogues are just there to keep the movie moving forward. Every single twist or trick the story had, you can easily realize them in first 20mins. From sword being useless to Wonder Woman being half-god (and later it is easy to guess who Ares is).<br/><br/>An example logic hole : Why the WW's mother haven't told her anything about her heritage and that sword is useless? It is very lame and just there to create the suspense for a twist, as it is disclosed further in the movie, we get to know that it didn't even changed a thing and Ares knew who she was the moment he saw her and haven't crushed her just to sway her to his side, and she was trying to find Ares anyways, her mother knew she was going to, so what the hell that logic served? Nothing but nearly getting her daughter killed and a very predictable twist. Whole story arc is built upon that one meaningless ""lets not tell her who she is"" decision.<br/><br/>How the hell they managed to go London overnight from super secret amazon island which is located (most likely since Ottoman involvement) in eastern mediterranean? Oh and there was a battleship closing in to the secret island, we can clearly see it while small boats are approaching to shores, what to hell happened to that? is it somehow vanished? <br/><br/>Her Lackeys were so bad, straight comical relief, an Indian chief, a Muslim looking comedian, a Scottish alcoholic and a British spy, I am seriously hurt that there were no Asians (sarcasm) and WW's enemies were no better, cartoonish villains, so evil that i bet they can enjoy puking around, and Ares' lines could've been so much stronger for such a topic, the nature of humanity, he was instead some form of biblical Satan, a straight up copy. <br/><br/>The last 30 minutes was bubblegum advertisement kind of action and the amount of crap in regards of WW 1 was really astonishing! It looked more like a fanfic story than a multi-million movie. <br/><br/>The the logic holes continue all through the movie from small things to getting the British spy/pilot killed for no reason. What kind of a gas filled plane explosion can effect 120km? then why the hell blowing it up in air within what looks like to be 1- 2km is a good idea? Why not just taking it to a safe airfield or just sinking it to sea? Sure, we needed that to create a feeling of loss. Oh, everyone (even Germans) are talking in English with little to no accent and only our spy makes heavy German accent for some reason.<br/><br/>I admit, it is a big win for being the 2nd biggest production with a female director and the first serious standalone super-heroine movie but Wonder Woman sure looked more like a naive supermodel and fictionalized men's fantasy more than anything. Gadot's cast seems to be liked by everyone, she was not bad in action sequences but she had like 2 different facial expressions ranging from serious/angry to confused/fun. <br/><br/>The movie, for me, is really degrading one huge part of history, the seminal catastrophe and somehow shows Germans like evil Nazis in 1910s even though all sides of WW1 had very similar motivations and employed very similar tactics.<br/><br/>I'd get it, if someone just whispers my way ""shhh! the movies scores are high because of people being politically correct"" but somehow even the most trollish movie bashers are dismissing everything bad about the movie for Gadot's action performance, women's equality in movie/comic industry and the movie is still better than suicide squad."
"barbagvido","10","11","28","7 June 2017"," Indeed, one of DC's best
","Wonder Woman is the fourth movie in the DCEU and the first time the character of Wonder Woman (a.k.a. Diana Prince) gets her own live-action movie. There were reasons to worry. DCEU has had three chances and they blew each one, why would this be different? Well, it just is. They actually put their heart in this one.<br/><br/>Even though this is coming from a person who liked all the previous DCEU movies (don't judge me), this is well worth your time. I didn't really find many big flaws and I'm aware of the flaws that the previous DCEU movies had. They just didn't bother me so much. The dialogues are fun and at times hilarious. Seriously, the first half is quite funny. But the too sudden tonal shift may bother some viewers a little because the first and the second half almost feel like two different movies. But they are both equally heartfelt and enjoyable. They just should have been put together a bit better. But it still works and delivers on the action, emotion and entertainment. Think first half Marvel, second half DC. But both at their best. The first half is funny, entertaining, mostly lighthearted and is a good set-up for what's to come. The second half goes a bit darker, but it's not Batman v Superman level of dark, there are still occasional bursts of happiness (there is one gorgeous dance scene). Still, even though it's dark, it's hopeful and gives a lot more depth to the movie with its themes. From a visual perspective, it's alright. The CGI could be better, but it's okay, some might be bothered by the overuse of slow motion, but I was cool with it. But, everyone who didn't like the bleak colors of the previous DCEU movies, than this is your cup of tea and it helps lift up the atmosphere into something more hopeful. Gal Gadot is beautiful, charismatic and perfect for Wonder Woman, she just felt so natural. And Chris Pine is at his best for now. Sometimes a great comic relief, sometimes just a very strong character. Another thing I really liked about this is how it shows tolerance. Usually with this kind of movie, you would expect massive feminism, looking at men from above etc. But this movie really doesn't do that. It's equal to everyone and that's one of the main reasons I love it. It shows tolerance.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very uplifting, entertaining and heartfelt film which was just what DC needed. Warner Bros. finally let things happen the way they should and it turned out wonderful."

","Wonder woman. Seriously this movie makes me to question myself, ""What did I like in Marvel movies?"". This movie has everything. It has comedy (Not stupid jokes in the middle of action scenes like marvel). The jokes fit in the plot. The action scenes are way better than in the other DC movies (Of course not including TDK series). Especially the scenes where the Wonder woman Theme plays in the background. Those scenes gave me goosebumps. The visual effects are stunning which makes it a crime to watch this movie in 2D. After watching this movie we can expect some more good movies from DC. Acting by Gal Gadot is awesome. If you have watched other movies in DC like 'Suicide squad' and are in an opinion that there will be no more good movies from DC, this movie will change that opinion entirely."

"ashleythemorningstar","10","11","28","2 June 2017"," Simply Wonderful
","The film continues from where Batman VS. Superman left off--Diana receiving her photo, taken during WWI, from Bruce, suggesting that one day she might tell him her story, prompting the movie to begin- - starting with Diana's childhood. From there, she learns of Ares, her mother dancing around her true purpose--given a simple explanation of what drives men to do the things the things they do. Hippolyta never wanted this fate for her daughter, but it was inevitable--she knew there was nothing she could do to stop her. Eventually conceding as she grew older, Diana was trained harder than any other Amazon--until one day, Steve Trevor crashed on the island.<br/><br/>Throughout the film there's a juxtaposition of humor and darkness, and it's offset *wonderfully*. Chris Pine's fumbling to find the right words, contrasted to Gadot's charming innocence about the world, makes for a number of laughs that are never at the titular heroine's expense. One particular part I really enjoyed was when they were sailing to London--their dialogue about sleeping together a perfect example of what I'm talking about--Diana's book smarts straight and to the point while Steve awkwardly shuffles about his own customs and culture. The subtle implication of Diana's bisexuality was also welcome, citing men as necessary for reproducing, but ""unnecessary for pleasure."" This would alternate throughout the film, humor filled to serious or even tragic scenes, this is an area in structure where Wonder Woman exceeded my expectations with mistressful construction.<br/><br/>There were themes of female empowerment, in a time where women were little more than objects, secretaries, second class citizens rife with complacency. At numerous points, Diana stood up, not allowing herself to be silenced. Three instances come to mind, that really resonated with me. The first: as Trevor delivered Dr. Poison's notebook, she was turning heads, because it was not customary for a woman to be involved with such matters. A bit taken aback by Trevor's actions, she marched back in, and called the general--who subtlety mocked her for being a woman--on what he was: a coward-- informing him that true leaders do not hide behind their soldiers, but die on the battlefield with them. This was done exceptionally well, because that's how things were back then-- it's a scenario to be expected, and Diana didn't simply give into the subtle social cues and allow them to anger her--no she rose above and called out what she saw as wrong--the implication tactfully given, as opposed to an obvious ""you're sexist"" type dialogue. The second instance was in the bar, when she was again, mocked--why would a woman be on the front? Immediately she disposed that idea, but this time with action, saving her future brother in arms' life--demonstrating that she has what it takes to go the distance. The third takes place as they make their way through the trenches-- Steve explains it's ""no man's land,"" and that no man can get through--but Diana wouldn't take no for an answer, and does what no man was capable--charging into the line of fire, herself a glimmer of hope much like the light on reflecting off her bodice, in a dead world. This delves back to earlier, when they were sailing to London--Steve stating that no one man would be able to stop the war, to which Diana stated she would be that man--that person.<br/><br/>And in the end, Diana walks through the celebrations--the end of the war in Man's World. With a half-hearted smile, she walks to a bulletin board, where she spots a photo of Steve Trevor--nearly breaking down in tears (in turn making me, once more, break into tears). Yes, it was a happy ending, but at what cost? The world is saved, for the time being, the war ended--Ares defeated, but the man she loved gone. There is a conflict presented within Wonder Woman at the beginning of the film, and it hits hard, harder than she hit that tower with the German sniper she crumbled--as she truly does learn the hard way. Transitioning back to the present, we come to understand her words at the beginning. She felt she could save the world, that it was all black and white, that Ares' corruption would be amended by his death, solving every problem and ending the war, freeing all the men from evil, until she came to realize that it wasn't just the Germans that were corrupted, it was the world, filled with so much darkness, independent of Ares, but even with the one she loved dead, she would not back down--would not feed into that darkness and join Ares--and she tells us, before she leaps into the sky, that love is what stands above all else, what wins in the end, what she must fight for.<br/><br/>Overall, as a huge fan that went in unsure, I was not disappointed. It was an emotional roller coaster that had me on the edge of my seat at one point, crying at another (my eyes are still stained, mascara smeared as I write this). While sometimes the film relied too heavily on CGI (the third act), it never took away from the theatrics (Diano's lasso play was amazing to see and everything I could have hoped for). Acting was stellar throughout, though the villains at times, such as General Ludendorff and Ares often fell flat, and Dr. Poison- -by far the most compelling of the group--could have been developed more, Gadot--she was absolutely stunning--the foundation of the film-- curious and innocent, she never makes us feel that Diana is stupid or filled with angst, but instead a constant beacon of hope even when things are at their worst--with Pines providing a captivating accent to her lead--a balanced chemistry of antithetical cultures. Wonder Woman is a fine example of what the DCEU should be- -what a female-lead narrative should be."
"cruise01","10","10","25","3 June 2017"," Wonder Woman is awesome and an exciting origin story and hopefully a better turn for its direction with DC.
","Wonder Woman being brought to the big screen after being a big icon as a character from an old TV show or animated movies. This being DC fourth movie in their extended universe after last years BvS and Suicide Squad. Wonder Woman is lighter in tone but at the same time growing more as a inspirational character. The movie is awesome, it does well with its plot, has a developed script, acting was fun and good. The action and visual effects were great. May have a scene of cheesy cgi, but it is easily forgiven for trying. Director Patty Jenkins did great adapting a superhero film, maybe she will be the DC version of how Sam Raimi was with his Spider-Man movies good except for the overwhelming third movie.<br/><br/>The plot follows Diana, a girl at heart, raised on an island of Themyscira. Land of the Amazonians and led by her queen mother Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen). Her mother does not wish for her to learn about fighting. Diana's desire to train to become a fighter, and trained by Antiope (Robin Wright). As years go by, Diana rescues an Air force pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) after crashing near the island, escaping from the Germans in the midst of World War 1. Diana learns from him about the war, and is willing to help defend the world. Her believing that Ares, the god of war is behind this conflict. She goes with Steve to civilization in London to accompany him on being part of this war. All while, Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya) are planning an ultimate attack with their secret hidden weapon.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman was a perfect origin story, we see her as a child. She is curious about the world and where she came from. Which we learn very little about. She grows and wants to be part of this world in defending people. Her character is vulnerable, believing everyone is good. Until, she sees battle and people fighting each other.<br/><br/>The action and visual effects were exciting and awesome. The battle sequence with Wonder Woman running through no mans land with mortars blasting on her side. Reflecting bullets off her shield and body armor. Her character has this stylized fighting either using her sword or Lasso. Or even punching guys through buildings. The film may have less action than the last three DC movies, but this film was more grounded to building this character emotionally. When it comes to the action sequences and the climax, it does not disappoint. Even with her fight with the villain, which explodes with spectacular visual effects.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is amazing as Wonder Woman, she is beautiful and a great choice as the character. Chris Pine did great as Steve. Robin Wright, David Thewlis, and Connie Nielsen were perfect. Danny Huston and Elena Anaya were menacing.<br/><br/>The film does have some fun with Diana going to London and how she interacts with this whole new world. The way she feels about dresses or how people act and think. Patty Jenkens tries to have a little fun with that by adding some humor. The main theme song that was done in BvS is also back in the movie which is pretty cool. <br/><br/>Overall, Wonder Woman is a great superhero film with awesome action, great story and direction. I definitely recommend the film, you will not be disappointed like the other DC films. Cant wait to see the character return in Justice League."
"rolando19552001","10","10","25","1 June 2017"," Wonderful Wonder Woman
","Wonderful Wonder Woman<br/><br/>The film is a plethora of genres and themes, subjects that are nuanced that combined to form a masterpiece of a film. Elegant, smart, beautiful as the Wonder Woman herself, personified by the comely Gal Gadot that steals the movie with a performance full of empathy, a loving performance that shows that sometimes love may be the answer for human issues. Of course this movie is not the first to say that love is the paramount theme to help one neighbors and brothers. This film talked about two brothers, Ares the god of war that hungers to show that humanity is failed experiment, that humanity's vices, war, hatred, hunger, destruction, abuse, anger all of this are what make humans what they are and this is why they are not worth saving, that they are not worth the hassle and sacrifice that the other sibling wants to, that humans are overall good, decent people who sometimes must be shown the right way, because sometimes they do not better and think doing bad is natural and is part of the human condition. That is why Wonder Woman is not comparable to other Marvel films, the only one may be Captain America The First Avenger which its character Captain America, Steve Rodgers is similar to this wonderful film. But Wonder Woman the film is more similar to Superman the movie with Christopher Reeves, it has a lot of nuances and examples when there are similarities with Superman the movie and this Wonder Woman film, glasses are used by both Clark Kent and Diana Prince to mask the secret identities of Superman and Wonder Woman and the latter shows how like Kal El before, Wonder Woman can be an example to humanity that they can see that good can overcome the bad, that good is more powerful and in this case of Wonder Woman love may be indeed the answer of the pettiness, selfishness, envy of this material world. As we can read, it is philosophical cinema, ideas, themes, characterizations, it has action scenes that are very powerful, I do not think they are perfunctory, you need a little action in comic book movies, it can not always be light or diet, you need action in drama. Wonder Woman is a war film, yes, but you can easily say it is also a love film, by the powerful relationship that shows between Chris Pine as Captain Steve Trevor who completely falls for the beautiful Wonder Woman, and I do not think a decent man would not fall for a woman as beautiful from the inside and her physique as Wonder Woman, in this case Gal Gadot whose presence at seeing her in the screen with her eyes that show understanding, compassion, a light of humanity, the love story between them is great, powerful and very dramatic, even lachrymose. Great film, they say this is the best DC film since the Dark Knight in 2008, at first I was incredulous as I did like the Dark Knight Rises, but when I saw Wonder Woman I grasped that the veracity of how good, full of hope, pain, how you see how a naive young woman see the flaws of men and see that not everything is light and good, but how a man shows her that there are still good people and that one people is enough to believe and save the world as Steve Trevor showed Wonder Woman, it is not what others do that matters, it is what you do that matters, you are the one that can be the change Steve Trevor said, so help me make it and Wonder Woman hears her lover words and followed his wise words that make her believe in humanity. Bravo, great film, humanistic, an idealistic film, 10, as close to perfect as you can ask for, DC is back."

Young Diana, learns how to combat anyway and ends up becoming the strongest Amazonian on the island and leaves the island to fight a war to end all wars. As the story develops, the script has a good sprinkle of humor, and is fast paced right till the very end. The only gripe I had about the film was that for such a strong empowering film for women, the final bit of motivation that wonder woman got to defeat Aries, was derived from her love for a man! Ironic.<br/><br/>Despite that, I strongly recommend this film!"

"JadeIslandReviews","6","9","22","16 June 2017"," Good for Comic Fans, Painful for Historians
","Wonder Woman (2017) is the best DCEU film since the Dark Knight Rises. Having said that, it is not great but it is a good comic movie that will satisfy 2 hours. It's not as good as the Nolan films but not nearly as bad as the other recent DC movies. The acting from the leads is solid. As a lifelong Wonder Woman fan, Gal Gadot is my new favorite Wonder Woman by far. She's not perfect acting-wise, but her beauty, confidence and strength sells it. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor is believable and you care about him. The story is simple (bad guy wants to destroy humanity and the heroes stop him) but very focused. The comedy is a lot similar to Thor's but still enjoyable and does its own thing.<br/><br/>With all that said, my main issues with the film are with some of the characters (and how they are driven) and the time capsule of the film. Wonder Woman is great but for much of the film, she often feels like a supporting character in her own movie. While not intentional, Trevor is the one that drives the plot and kind of takes over the film. While I like his character, the film is called 'Wonder Woman'. She should've been allowed to make some more decisions for herself. I also want to add that the side characters are passable but could've been better. I honestly didn't really remember them after the movie was over. <br/><br/>My other issue is the film being set during WWI. The comics are set during WWII. This made sense since the Nazis ideologies were evil and this was when chemicals were really being advanced (Holocaust anyone?). WWI was a lot more politically complex and was basically the clash of empires. No side was completely innocent. I get this is just for entertainment but, as someone with a history degree, it is distracting. Captain America: the First Avenger worked well with WWII and think Wonder Woman would've made more sense too in that time period. I mean the Germans they're describing are Nazis, not Kaiser imperial soldiers. The film just felt more WWII-ish than WWI. Watch War Horse (2011) to compare. I just wonder (haha) what happened when WWII started for Diana. I guess that was just ""Ares"" too and that'll be the sequel? If so, then what will have been the point in this film or Trevor's fate?<br/><br/>There is not much else to comment on. The film looked really good, even beautiful at times. The music was pretty forgettable (no memorable theme that Wonder Woman deserves). <br/><br/>Overall, I give the film a B-. It wasn't great but wasn't bad either. I think it is a step in the right direction for DC. I would recommend the film for at least one viewing."

Finally the superhero(one) film we've all been waiting for - the big-screen adaptation of DC Comics' Amazonian princess warrior, Diana (full-bodied, fierce and fun Gadot) fulfills her tribes' prophecy to defend mankind from the injustices of the world she cohabits including WWII Nazis with the able help of American spy/pilot Steve Trevor (dreamy and dead-panned Pine making for a dynamic duo) who enlists her with deft skill and sudden love for. Well-crafted screenplay by Allan Heinberg with Zaach Snyder, Allan Heinberg & Jason Fuchs' well-oiled machine of a storyline faithful to William Moulton Marston's creation. Big props to Patty Jenkins for proving her mettle as a filmmaker with the best of them incorporating some jaw-dropping stunt-work, fight sequences and CGI dazzle while allowing her showcase for the one female empowerment generations can all agree on. In a word: wonderful."

","If you are going to see this movie take a cut lunch with you as it is LONG! And boring in parts. They spent way too much time on the back story and one assumes that was because they are planning sequels. The movie could lose 40 minutes without damaging the story line. With any of these block buster type Super hero movies I am left with the definite impression many of the ""reviewers"" on IMDb are either studio plants or have not seen the actual movie and base their votes on Trailers. Much of the final scenes was over bloated and unnecessary and did not add anything to the story. Gadot was outstanding in the title role. Chris Pine looks, as he always does, on the verge of tears or a breakdown or something. I don't rate him as an actor. Supporting cast were good. Over all the movie had good production values, a so so script and the CGI was good but over done in the final scenes. A good movie but not a great movie. Worth the admission price."

","If you never read or watched anything Wonder Woman before, you are in for a treat. Wonder Woman does a excellent job showing Diana Prince (played by Gal Gadot) origin story into what defines her as a heroine. The movie does an fantastic job with screenplay, beautiful cinematography, story telling, and bits of humor to help define supporting characters. It is very easy to watch and follow.<br/><br/>If you have read her comic books before or the animated film, you will find that this live-action film does it justice.

"hungnv92","10","9","22","3 June 2017"," A simple, maybe a little bit naive idea for a cruel world
","""Love can end the war"". <br/><br/>Not like the The Dark Knight, Wonder Woman has a simple, maybe a little bit naive idea for a cruel world. Just like Diana herself. <br/><br/>The cinematic is beautiful, the fight is intense with good slow-mo, the music is epic and the story is touching. Maybe the movie itself was directed by a woman, so it is really emotional, a lot of feeling. I literally heard people sit next to me cried. The movie also has some humor scenes, not so much, but enough to keep it not too dark. <br/><br/>The story is simple: a hero from an island that out of mankind's knowledge goes to the real world. She with her ""above average"" lover and friends go on a impossible mission to fight the bad guy and save people. And the most important thing in the first movie of any superhero is, the hero found more about herself and her responsibility. This is the part that this movie did so well. <br/><br/>The character development is neat, no rushing, no long boring emotional scene, just enough. The story is simple, but enough for us the understand the feeling of an innocent hero faced the cruel reality world. It made very clear about the point that mankind doesn't deserve her. But the love, the good part of people we met helped her choose the path. And the peace didn't come without a cost. <br/><br/>The Wonder Woman of Gal reminded me about the Superman of Christopher Reeve, a good and simple person, symbol of hope. No matter what happened, she just keep following her good heart. I believe this movie will bring Gal Gadot to the next level of her acting career.<br/><br/>Chris Pine's role is well done. A complex spy, that is opposite to Diana. He knows the real world, and tried a lot to explain to Diana, but not too mumbo-jumbo or dramatic about that. <br/><br/>Some other characters are fine, but somehow faded along the movie. <br/><br/>Conclusion, as a fan of DC, I maybe a bit bias for this movie. But it's really good, a lot better than I expected after recent movies from DC. It doesn't bring too much that may make too much messy to digest, but also not too simple to make it a cheap entertainment movie."

","I have recently went to the movies to see this film. Not knowing what to expect, I was quite amused by the how well the movie was put together. The overall graphics of realistic scenes created an excellent plot for the story.Unlike other superhero movies this one demonstrated great production of intense action and occasional humor. The actresses really carried out their role to perfection and I could tell lots of time and effort went in to producing this film. I also was satisfied by the heroic story line portrayed. There was never a dull moment in the movie, which in return kept me in tune. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who loves the feeling of being intrigued."
"tomgillespie2002","7","6","13","8 September 2017"," Above all else, Wonder Woman is charming, funny and exciting
","It's incredibly sad to read about how many milestones Wonder Woman touches on, especially in this day and age where a high-profile Twitter user must consider every message they post to the world in fear of being racist, sexist, homophobic, or just plain insensitive. Despite the influx of superhero movies since Marvel kicked off their Cinematic Universe in 2008 with Iron Man, and despite the abundance of long-standing and hugely popular female superheroes existing in the comics, and despite audiences calling out for a female-led superhero film ever since Scarlett Johansson donned the leathers as Black Widow in Iron Man 2, studios have failed to deliver one in 12 years. Perhaps the studios were scared they would have another Elektra on their hands, but that movie failed because it was terrible, and was a spin-off from the also-terrible Daredevil.<br/><br/>The DC Extended Universe, in the face of the critical mauling they received last year with the double-whammy of Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, can only be applauded for taking the much-overdue 'risk' of launching a female-led franchise with Wonder Woman, a movie that not only represents so much in terms of moving cinema out of a stone-age mentality and into the modern world, but surpasses all expectations in a time of superhero overkill. Wonder Woman is, above all, charming, funny and exciting, and will hopefully help steer the DCEU back on track after an incredibly wobbly start. Making her introduction in Batman v Superman and emerging as one of the few positive things to be said about Zack Snyder's overblown and poorly-constructed smack- down, Wonder Woman begins in the present day but flashes back to the time glimpsed in the black-and-white photograph sent to her by Ben Affleck's Batman, when World War I was in full flow and her heart was won by a spy named Steve.<br/><br/>The young Diana grows up on the island of Themyscira, a beautiful hidden paradise created by Zeus to be a home for the Amazons, a tribe of fierce female warriors tasked with protecting the world from the Greek God's evil, warmongering brother Ares. Diana's mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), attempts to shield her from the horrors of war and forbids her to practice combat, while her auntie Anitope (Robin Wright) realises her potential and trains her in secret. Zeus left the islanders a gift, a weapon called the 'Godkiller', which will prove decisive when the battle with Ares finally stirs. Cue the arrival of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), an Allied spy who stumbles on the island while fleeing the Germans. He brings death and war with him, and the Amazons want to kill him before Diana intervenes, revealing he saved her life. The tribe want nothing to do with a war waged by man, but Diana suspects Ares may be puppet-master behind the conflict that has taken millions of lives. Against her mother's wishes, she travels with Steve to London, where he reveals to his superiors German plans to release a devastating new mustard gas created by General Ludendroff (Danny Huston) and Spanish chemist Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya).<br/><br/>The word 'man' carries a special significance, and director Patty Jenkins carefully weaves this idea into the film without rubbing it in your face. As well as the violent, dangerous 'world of men' lurking across the waters, there is also No Man's Land, the stretch of mud and rubble separating the two warring fronts. This is a place that no man can hope to survive, and this sets up the triumphant moment seen in the trailers in which Diana deflects machine-gun fire with her bracelets and shield before taking out anybody daft enough to stand in her way. This scene is made all the more powerful by Gal Gadot, who puts in a terrific performance despite her lack of acting experience and puts all the doubters to rest, proving to be just as savvy with comedy as the action. The fact that we care so much about her also means that the CGI-heavy climax, which seems to be trend with DC, can almost be forgiven. Thanks to well-written character development and some charming chemistry between Gadot and the ever- brilliant Chris Pine, there is a real emotional investment that was lacking in DC's previous misfires. In terms of origin stories, this doesn't rewrite the rule-book, but the importance and significance of Wonder Woman should not be underestimated."
"ciskowski","8","6","13","30 July 2017"," Finally, a fun DC film.
","A well-done superhero film with an enjoyable plot and a likable cast. Gal Godot is a find as Wonder Woman, balancing wisdom and naivete, assurance and uncertainty. She plays Wonder Woman as serious without being ponderous -- something that was missing from earlier DC films. (I'm looking at you, Superman.) Setting the film during World War I is a bit risky, but it gives the film a different feel and a suitable stage for the confrontation with Ares. I continue to be disappointed with climactic battle scenes created almost entirely in CGI; this film is no worse than most and at least limits its worst uses to the a few minutes at the end. I very much want to see Diana Prince carried forward into the present day: familiar with the world, canny in its ways, but still holding to her timeless values. Until then, we have an origin story that feels fresh and fun, and which brings us a wonderful new character and actor."

Gal Gadot is just incredible as Wonder Woman with her impeccable beauty and decisive appearance combining both beauty and war/leading skills without losing her femininity. The plot although quite simple and maybe a little naive, manages to attract the interest of the spectator and doesn't get boring. The humorous moments come to complete this beautiful puzzle with the action and the - rather over-used - slow motion and give us a quite satisfactory result which addresses not only to DC fans, but to anyone who loves action movies with humanistic messages."
"kailomonkey","10","6","13","28 June 2017"," better than expected
","This movie was better than I expected. To give you a background to my expectations: DC Superhero films of late haven't been great. I enjoyed Dawn of Justice with its slow arty style but probably wouldn't rewatch. Suicide Squad was terrible as it didn't live up to the style and pace of the trailer and it seemed cut to ribbons perhaps after the bad reception of their slow moving previous film. Wonder Woman's arrival in Dawn of Justice was perhaps the best moment but I also found it a bit cringe-worthy. All this gave me a feeling of uncertainty over whether DC superheroes could pull off a good movie...<br/><br/>But they did! Sure the boat scene went on a bit long, I understand it was meant to be awkward but it hung on it awkwardly too... But the rest of the movie was grand; in its mythical location and the protagonist's power. The main villain was kind of off-putting holding onto his human face, perhaps he could have transformed. Also having to have love as our female protagonist's core value seemed sexist but... It was really good to see a return to superheroes with values. Superman used to be about values but now he's just a strong superhuman. Wonder Woman fills the void in having a few classic superhero moments, and in coming to terms with humanities evils, something a lot of the real world is forced to struggle with these days more than ever.<br/><br/>Action was pretty good, I can never stand the lets-pointlessly- throw-each-other-into-things trope often used in action movies which did happen near the end, but at least it soon moved on."

","I don't mind comic movies. I enjoyed Dr. Strange. But Wonder Women is just a steaming pile of garbage. Acting is forced and bad (other than Chris Pine who stands out). Story is hollow and slugs along as a disjointed set of sequences. <br/><br/>Gal looks great but acts horribly. I see the decision to cast her only as an attempt to lure the F&F crowd... wrong person for the role. <br/><br/>Other than hot actors and some decent special effects, I don't see how people are able to give this movie anything above 6."

Well, they do ban movies all the time when the story is telling the trough. But it's allowed to race bait for decades in the western movie industry? Horrible. <br/><br/>Second - The actors: Robin Wright for example. Yesterday she was the First Lady and now she's playing an Amazon. This fact alone is hindering you right from the start to let yourself fall and just enjoy a movie. It's just not possible if you have a normally functioning brain. Or Lucy Davis as Etta Candy. Are you kidding me? Even for a comic adaptation this charakter is highly unreliable. Stupid. Not funny. Stupid. Mind numbing. The ""A lot of humor, a good heart...and fat"" character. <br/><br/>Poor dialogs (""She's trying on dress number 226"") <- Are you kidding me?

(invented and produced over night of course!)<br/><br/>Really. As if this movie was made just for kids or braindeads.<br/><br/>Go on. Try it and see for yourself.

"kastenmeier-andreas","8","8","19","22 July 2017"," Finally Female!
","""Wonder Woman"" is getting a lot of praise and I get why. Firstly, the DCEU movies, though commercial successes, disappointed fans, movie lovers and critics alike and therefore the expectations were low. Secondly, all attempts of female lead superheros bombed, only look at ""Catwoman"" or ""Elektra"", which lowers these expectations even more. And finally Gal Gadot's critically seen casting also contributes to this argument.<br/><br/>So the good movie and great performance Gal Gadot and her director Patty Jenkins are delivering, defies this expectations and everyone was very surprised. The movie was bright and colorful, funny, had character development and good chemistry between all of the characters. Also the action sequences were shot in a very different and interesting way. All points that proved that ""Wonder Woman"" is good. Gal Gadot, just to mention it, is absolutely perfect for this role.<br/><br/>But why do I think this movie isn't great or deserves a rating of 9 or 10? Simply because I hated the final confrontation and god plot. Sorry for those who enjoy scenes like this, I find no enjoyment in gods stupidly fighting each other by destroying everything. I am tired of these endings. It seems that there are two options: sky beam or god like creatures. Both endings are stupid! Just watch the creative way ""Doctor Strange"" or ""Ant-Man"" handled their climax. More of this kind please! But after all this complaints, ""Wonder Woman"" is really good in many ways. Every detail in the first hour and a half fits and is a joy to watch. The ending is a bit weaker but still good."
"jamescurtis-14749","9","8","19","18 July 2017"," Overview
","I felt that the production of Wonder Woman was wonderful for the most part. The fact that the hero in this movie is a female, which is not the case in most heroic movies, is a huge part of what made this movie so intriguing. DC has provided one of the best movies that they've made so far, and here's a few reasons why. The acting of Gal Gadot was already previously recognized in other films. The action scenes were spread throughout the movie very evenly. The small comedic moments were placed throughout the movie very efficiently such as the scene of Wonder Woman and the soldier in the boat. Another comedic scene was when she needed a new outfit and proceeded to carry her shield and sword out of the building while in civil attire. The only flaw I would say there was in the plot line was the fact that Wonder Woman's, ""hidden home"" was so easy to stumble upon. What compelled the enemy soldiers to head in that direction which happened to be her home? Wasn't her home superbly hidden by the Gods? Wonder Woman brought in history throughout a lot of the movie. The scene where Chief explains how Trevor's people killed off most of his people is a prime example of the history that was included. The movie even included the element of romance as well. Chris Pine was a wonderful pair with Gal Gadot as her lover in the movie. Not only that, but Pine's character Steve Trevor made a great addition to Diana Prince in battle. The two of them brought the movie comedy, action, and love. The setting of the movie was also very well complemented by the London setting and the torn down city of London. In the scene where Diana, and Steve entered London, it showed an aerial view of the city which looked wonderful in my opinion. The movie incorporated the differences between Diana's home and the real world during the 1900s which added to the movie. The production of Wonder Woman is one of DC's greatest works as I said before. Patty Jenkins and the cast did a wonderful job on directing and creating this production."
"bridgetbridget","5","8","19","14 June 2017"," Wonder Woman
","Wonder Woman started off really well with stunning visuals of Thermyscira the island created by Zeus for the Amazonian women.They did a good job portraying it to be untouched by the modern era. As well as an excellent job of developing the secondary characters that Steve (the main character) brings, given the run time. The movie was too long and had many lines and scenes that could of been cut out and still remained a good plot. The theme lasting as long as it did was a huge downfall for me. Another main issue that I had with the film was the cheesy war video game like graphics and the unnecessary slow motion effects. I did however like the main themes portrayed in the movie, doing what is right, women equality, moral ethics,serving for the greater good as well as the romance involved."

"TheImitationWavess","Null","8","19","4 June 2017"," Great movie but not without flaws *spoilers included*
","I was walking into Wonder Woman with high expectations given the reviews. However, I had read some critics reviews and while the critics said it was a really good addition to the superhero movie with great casting (Gal Gadot was perfectly cast), the story had flaws. I do agree with those critics. Still, I walked out thinking it was a great movie and would go back again and again to see it.<br/><br/>The great thing about the movie really are the actors. Gadot blew me away. Whoever cast her for the role of Wonder Woman deserves a medal. She really embodied everything that is Wonder Woman to me. She's charming, funny, smart, naive and absolutely bad-ass. Gadot carries this role off with panache. Robin-Wright Penn and Connie Nielsen were also well cast in their respective roles. <br/><br/>In terms of story, the first half is slow as it introduced Diana's back-story. However, I appreciated the slowness if only to make me understand where the character came from and what motivated her. The second half made up for the slowness when the action kicked into high gear. I will say this though about the first half, the imagery is mind-blowing. There are absolutely gorgeous screen-shots of the island from which Diana originated. <br/><br/>The great thing about the story was that Wonder Woman is portrayed as a great fighter while still retaining her heart, humanity and sense of wonder. Another great thing about the story was the twist with Areas near the end of the movie. I have to admit it took me by surprise, and I am rarely caught off-guard anymore when it comes to plot twists. Well done by the writer!<br/><br/>Unfortunately there were weaknesses. There wasn't enough explanation about why some characters were motivated to do certain things or why they believed the way they believed. There was little explanation why some characters were ""evil"" while others were ""good"". In other words, there was a shortage of backstory. Then again, you can only do so much in two and a half hours.<br/><br/>There was also a moral/philosophical stance the movie took, that I understood was important to the story. However, it was never truly explored how Wonder Woman arrived at the conclusions she did except for ""love"". Don't get me wrong, love is a great motivator, but it just wasn't enough, given the horrors that she saw for the first time and the internal crisis she faced, when the rosy glasses she wore about humanity finally fell off and she saw the world and human beings for what they were. Lastly, the free will argument was weak in the movie. I found the movie to give mixed messages about that and in some places, it was contradictory.<br/><br/>However, this wasn't a philosophical movie but an action-hero movie. It's important to put that in context. So overall the fact that the movie had some philosophical failings isn't really a major problem. I'm hoping the writer and director will continue exploring those themes in the subsequent movies, in fact, to give us some more insight into the Wonder Woman and her motivations. I will also say that I am VERY glad that the movie brought up these questions of ""what is good?"", ""what is bad"", ""where do I fit in?"" The world isn't black and white and action hero movies shouldn't be either.<br/><br/>Having said that, I really thought overall it's a great movie and it was really elevated by the actors performances, especially Gadot. I'm hoping to see a lot more of her on the big screen in the future!"

I was driven to distraction by edits from the evil lab tech creating a poisonous gas and the touristy dynamic of misfit Wonder Woman and her soft-boiled escort. Needless to say, I left early. I think it was around the time that the fish out of water routine got boring. For example, Pine's character remained surprised by the female warrior routine, and Gadot stayed unabashed in the cultural millieu of gender stuff in that era. I can't remember exactly, but I think there was a scene of too much alcohol - so tacky - that Leaving was the only right response. Thanks, miss it."
"toogoodu-56389","1","7","16","8 October 2017"," Breakdown of an abomination
","I read some reviews, a couple of which said this movie is an abomination. Now that I have finally seen the movie, I can say I know what they mean. Until seeing this movie, I was a die hard Wonder Woman fan. Now I am just repulsed beyond description.<br/><br/>Breakdown of an abomination:<br/><br/>The Story- Wow, did they ever screw this storyline to hell and back! Diana was created out of love and loneliness, so Hippolyta could have her own daughter to love. She was blessed by the Goddesses, giving Diana a little piece of each of their powers. Diana was NOT created as weapon of mass destruction, nor was she created as a ""god killer""! Once again, Hollywood has completely abominized another great character into being nothing more than a murder machine. They really did a HACK JOB on this story. One that is wrong on so many levels. <br/><br/>Sick and depraved doesn't even begin to cover this!<br/><br/>The Amazons- According to Diana's TRUE story, Amazons are thousands of years old and can live thousands of years. Yet we are expected to believe they instantly speak and understand ALL languages, when they have NEVER been off the island?!? The only ACCEPTABLE languages Amazons would speak, would be Greek, Roman, and Latin. And even with this, after thousands of years, they would have developed their own dialect and alternate language for themselves, they would have no concept of ""new"" languages, even though Diana is a quick learner, there is NO WAY she would have been able to converse in as many languages as she did in this movie. And all of the dialects and accents were VERY much out of place and not even remotely acceptable as being true to what the Amazons are. Again, another sick bastardization.<br/><br/>The Characters- Lucy Davis as Etta Candy was absolutely brilliant. How they could find such an awesome person to play such a small part, and choose the most unacceptable people for the leads is still beyond my comprehension! Chris Pine is good, and I do like him....but he is NO Steve Trevor. He is more suited for being a spy character. I can barely accept him as Captain Kirk as it is. But Steve Trevor he's not. David Thewlis as Ares God of War? I think I hurt myself laughing so hard! Wow, and I thought Gal Gadot was the worst choice made in this movie! Well, I guess there had to be comic relief....and he was obviously it!<br/><br/>Gal Gadot. I've read that RuPaul would have made a better choice for Wonder Woman, and I agree. Yes, she's pretty, but thats about it. She's no Amazon, she's no Diana Prince, and she is ABSOLUTELY NO WONDER WOMAN! And as with David Thewlis, nothing more than comic relief.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman- Wonder Woman cannot fly, she cannot levitate, she is no god, even though she has some of the powers of the Goddesses. Her tools of the trade (tiara, bracelets, lasso) don't hold any magical powers themselves....well, except for the lasso. The TRUE Wonder Woman doesn't use the tools of man (swords and shields), she uses the tools of Amazons to enhance her abilities, nothing more. She is not a psycho killer as Gadot's pathetic representation suggests. The TRUE Diana abhors violence and doesn't use it unless all other avenues have failed. She is also an Amazon, meaning she is slightly taller and more athletically built than the average man, not the size of a teenaged girl.<br/><br/>Summary- This ""movie"" IS an abomination to everything that the TRUE Wonder Woman stood for and is....er, was. Again, Hollywood bastardizing and trashing something good, for the almighty dollar. A back story bastardized and mangled, a culture made into something laughable, and with the exception of Lucy Davis, a cast of comedians attempting to play straight roles and serious characters. <br/><br/>The music in the movie was even wrong! It didn't fit the movie at all, and was depressing as hell. The soundtrack was NOT that of a superhero of any kind!<br/><br/>Feeble, miserable, and heart breaking doesn't even begin to cover this catastrophe.<br/><br/>Lynda Carter may have not been the ""serious"" Wonder Woman, but she apparently did her homework on who Diana truly is, and it really showed. <br/><br/>Sad to say, this life-long, die-hard Wonder Woman fan is no more. This ""movie"" completely destroyed everything that the Amazon is, and what she really could have been. Now there is nothing left but fond memories of what was."

Seriously? gal gadot is hot, SO WHAT? as a straight man I tell you that is not a qualification for becoming an actress. She cannot act, she cannot do the moves required,,, Literally just her tucking back her shoulder and posing,, what the actual fk? Chris Pine was OK, but the rest are as good as nonexistent. CGI was OK, i don't really focus much on the effects anymore since every movie is filled with them. I literally had no idea why things were done the way there were in this movie. from the start of the movie people who accidentally entered the hidden island did it as if it was something they do everyday. and then the ""you can't go.."". 10 seconds later.. ""i cannot stop you"". I could go on and on but you get my drift. Movie 3/10, but 1 to offset the false ratings."
"shanayneigh","1","7","16","9 September 2017"," Oh, hi Mark!
","Gal Gadot might have a pretty face, but she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Her acting and accent kept reminding me of Tommy Wiseau in The Room. And since she can't speak in anything but an Israeli accent (she's the new Schwarzenegger) the rest of the Amazon actors have to adopt fake accents. I say ""accents"" - plural - because they all speak with different imaginary accents, even those supposedly related to each other, which is just one indicator of how lazy this film is.<br/><br/>And I can't look past the fact that Gadot is a Zionist who has served in the Israeli Occupation Forces, which has oppressed the Palestinian population for decades. So when her character speaks about the plight of civilians and how she's dying to help them, it all rings false in my ears considering her background.<br/><br/>The movie's villain is a twist, which should come as a surprise to absolutely no one. The movie is hailed as a progressive one because it stars a female character and is directed by a woman, but no one seems to notice that the major bad guy in this movie is the only one who keeps talking about the importance of peace. How progressive that those seeking peace really are untrustworthy and/or evil on the inside. That's taken straight out of the right wing playbook and fitting for a fascist propaganda show like 24.<br/><br/>The final battle in Wonder Woman looks exactly like the final battle in Batman vs Superman. Seriously, you could lift clips from either movie and insert it into the other with no trouble at all.<br/><br/>And was any exterior shot in this movie actually shot on location? It felt like a Hitchcock movie. A lot of the green screen work and compositing in this movie looked even worse than the end fight in The Avengers (Loki on a space scooter anyone?) and that was made 5 years ago.<br/><br/>Finally, the slow motion. I feel like Zack Snyder strapped Patty Jenkins into a chair and forced her eyes open with clamps like in A Clockwork Orange and made her watch 300 on repeat. If you accentuate every single shot in a sequence with slow motion, in the end you accentuate nothing at all.<br/><br/>This movie was absolutely dreadful."

","This is definitely DC best film since The Dark Knight. I was very hesitant to see this film due to the fact that DC movies have been extremely disappointing in the past few years. Some of the positives include; The character development or our hero. Gal Gadot delivers the best performance possible for this character. From her appearance to her personality, she was perfect. I also liked how the film dealt with the supporting character played by Chris Pine. A film directed and dominated by women, did not feel like feminist overload. The male and female characters were given substantial depth. Some other positives include the action scenes, the look of the film and the score. Overall it was a very well directed, solid film, although a major problem was the depth of the villains. Every villain was extremely shallow, two dimensional and were not engaging. Another issue was the over use of CGI especially in the last scene. I also felt that some of the dialogue was quite weak, but on the other hand some of the dialogue was very funny and engaging. All in all I would really recommend this film. Its highly entertaining, and made extremely well. Patty Jenkins should direct more DC films.

Gal Gadot is beautiful but way too Auchwitz-survivor-looking to play the part of a strong amazon warrior, the love interest was boring, Wonder Woman was a blithering retard throughout the majority of the flick, there was no villain (turning some random guy into a cgi mess to wrap up the sh*t-pile last minute hardly counts), the cgi work was far below what should be expected these days, the writing was boring and highly predictable. The one thing I liked, the idea that mankind are not wholly good or evil almost got me back on board in the final act before the cgi monster came out and ruined the whole idea. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a poor-mans Captain America: The First Avenger, just with the genders reversed and about half the quality across the board.

It takes forever to get going (it's almost 90 minutes in before we see Wonder Woman in costume) and it is slow and quite frankly boring. It's also too serious and grim. Why do all DC super hero movies have to be so dark? Also Chris Pine is seriously miscast. On the plus side the action sequences are great. Full of energy and PG rated violence. Nice use of stop motion also. Gadot is great as Wonder Woman. She's strong, fearless and full of energy. Also nice production design and a bombastic music score.

","When Steve Trevor crash lands near Themyscira and is rescued by the 'most beautiful woman he has ever seen' he looks at her face and his first word is an understated ""wow "". In another movie, another genre, he would have been the star. His character is that strong. But here, in this movie he is second fiddle, the love interest. And Chris Pine does that remarkably well. As handsome as he is there is someone who is more beautiful. As strong as he is, there is someone who is stronger. As noble as he is, there is someone more noble. And that is Wonder Woman and that is Gal Gadot. Their interplay, their falling in love, their remarkable adventure together is for me the foundation of this wonderful movie. What a treat, to see two dynamic performances work perfectly in sync with each other in such grandiose settings. It's funny. romantic and believable. As for Gal Gadot. Besides her undeniable beauty it is the innocence she brings to Wonder Woman that I was not expecting and is totally endearing. She doesn't even know what she is capable of. We learn as she learns. We learn about her as she learns about herself and the world. Like a child growing up, we relearn the world through their eyes. We also relearn the pain and suffering as she does. But Gadot also imbues the character with such passion and confidence that I, like her compatriots, began to question which reality was real, theirs or hers. Most everything in this movie is first rate. The action sequence at no man's land is one of the best I have seen because it was so believable. I didn't know she could do that and neither did she. The setting of WW1 was done very well. All the supporting characters were fine and of course this doesn't get accomplished without the very capable directing of Patty Jenkins. But it is the acting of Chris Pine and Gal Gadot that makes this a very special movie. Wow indeed!"

"johnjones91","9","7","16","11 June 2017"," Wonder Woman 2017 Review
","Pros: The Wonder Woman (2017) film proved to be a equilibrium of Man of Steel with a little of Captain America The First Avenger. A mixture of origin was given that was well appreciated, with a superb nature that's aesthetic of vision that brings you into a new world that seems cleansed of pollution; therefore the Island's landscape was good. The storyline was more of a grade 8 out of a 10 point scale, for there was some inspirational moments that promoted somewhat of a Utopian view built of courage, love, humanitarianism and voluntary sacrifice. (Spoiler) Wonder Woman's idea of peace and love in men's hearts is that when a spiritual ground of warfare from the persuasion of the God of War and Malice is obliterated, peace and love will remain the only influence; it's nice to influence that narrative but unfortunately, its much deeper than that. <br/><br/>The action in the film was a total wonder of action, stylized in comic visage - graphic from it's speed-to-slow motion scenes. A warrior like characteristics (heroism) they made Wonder Woman, which I must say they've done exceptionally well. However, there were a good amount of scenes were it's a lot of slow-motion poses (seemingly; it's like ""take the picture type of position).<br/><br/>There was many humorous portions, you may inevitably laugh at some of those portions.<br/><br/>My favorite is they've staged Wonder Woman (2017)film as a lover of Men, not the vast majority of feminist today that oppress men, promote wantons, and give improvidence and dissipation. Conversely, Wonder Woman (WW) was portrayed as the treasure, which councils with sensible encouragement while crowning love and kindness to men despite there imperfections, WW symbolic as the nurture, submission of endearment, empowered by sensibility and understand of primitive behavior with hope. <br/><br/>Cons: Before I saw this movie I had skepticism that it would turn out to be a feminist film that would give a propaganda of victimization, and hatred of men and promote lesbianism. However, it was nearly the complete opposition accept for the moment she influence the propaganda that women secretaries is identified as slavery which slaves the last time I recall were barely or ever paid for their services. In addition (spoiler) when Wonder Woman emphasized that men are not needed for pleasure but only for procreation. However, despite the haughty of bitterness of whatever feminist promoted this in the storyline is non-aesthetic, non-prudential, non-ontological in a sense of connection of the physical and it's lingering endearments of erotic love in penetrative way of complementary opposition of the sexes. Furthermore, the very narrative of non-need of pleasure but only procreation denies the foundation of all women that are strong lovers of men, that look for the value of cherishing pleasure from men and have no desire to be socially constructive on the narrative that all else from men is irrelevant accept the portion of procreation. Pleasures in life are built on many things but not just the sense of the mate but that of ontological, fatherhood, and the abilities of a helping consort for vehement flame and backbone that's often innately physically stronger than the other without living in the fantasy conjunction of ignorance. It's wrong for a biological man to instate a biological woman as only need for procreation than pleasure; just as it's wrong for biological woman to instate a biological man is only needed for procreation and not pleasure. For it eliminations ontological of complementary aestheticism. <br/><br/>Overall: I've enjoyed the film and look forward to buying it in both 4k Ultra HD and 3d Blu-ray when made available to add to my collection of Man of Steel, BvS: Dawn of Justice, The Dark Knight Trilogy and Suicide Squad. Wonder Woman is an Epic film that's enjoyable to watch repeatedly like Man of Steel."
"markcharalambous","9","7","16","11 June 2017"," Wonder Woman a Solid Hit
","Yes, it's true. Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman. It may be a cliché by now, but I cannot imagine another actress as Wonder Woman. She is simply riveting on the screen. That much was evident from her first appearance in BvS: Dawn of Justice— owing mainly to her physical appearance. The directors chose a woman more reflective of the mythic origins; eschewing a Nordic-type beauty for a middle-eastern one: Israeli actress Gal Gadot. The look differs from previous incarnations from both television and the comic books, and it works to perfection.<br/><br/>But the really good news from Wonder Woman is that Gal Gadot is not only perfectly matched visually to the role, her character is also beautifully written! <br/><br/>This Wonder Woman is no smart-aleck, kick-ass gender-feminist seizing any opportunity to pummel men and ridicule our inadequacies while educating the audience on the evils of patriarchal oppression. Rather, she is what would be expected of a woman raised in a world without men, of a warrior caste, and raised to fear and distrust the ""other"": men. She is an innocent. And that is he how she acts and responds to the Europe of WW1—as well as to her love interest, British military spy Steve Trevor, adequately played by Chris Pine.<br/><br/>Diana was raised to believe that Zeus created the Amazons to protect mankind. A great conflict between the Gods resulted in the evil antagonist Ares, God of War, sowing evil, hatred and war among mankind. When she decides to accompany Trevor back to the ""world of men,"" it is with the explicit aim of killing Ares. She assumes that this will immediately put an end to all of mankind's strife, including the ""war to end all wars."" <br/><br/>Later, this belief is severely tested and leads to Diana's epiphany that enables her to reach her next level as a warrior, when she will eventually team up with Batman and the other members of the Justice League. <br/><br/>Upon arrival in London, her innocence serves as a device for social commentary when she is exposed to the ""modern"" world. When Trevor's secretary explains her job to Diana, she responds ""Where I come from, that's called slavery."" Earlier, in Themyscira, the hidden Amazon island into which chance draws Trevor and the War, he shows her his watch and explains it's function. Diana responds by asking him why he needs a device to tell him what to do?<br/><br/>Under less skillful direction, these bits could've come across as hackneyed or contrived. But to writer Allan Heinberg and Gadot's credit, they provide endearing moments of comic relief.<br/><br/>Sure, Wonder Woman is replete with social justice messaging (besides Trevor her entourage includes a middle-eastern POC and a Native American), but Gal Gadot is so sincere, believable—and winning—in the role, that I don't feel like I'm being hit over the head with it.<br/><br/>Naturally, Diana has plenty of opportunities to display her martial superiority to mere barroom thugs and heavily-armed German soldiers alike with only a sword, shield and her lasso. But that is to be expected. This is who the character is. What we don't get is the typical absurdities we've come to expect from the genre, such as beautiful women in high heels and lingerie handily dispatching gangs of thugs. Cue Atomic Blonde trailer.<br/><br/>Yes, Wonder Woman fails the Taylor Test , how could it not? We are, after all, talking about the Amazons—the cultural archetype of ""strong women."" They and she, a 1940s comic book character inspired by the ancient Greek legend, are not products of present-day feminism.<br/><br/>You may have noticed the buzz of negative criticism for the movie from feminist quarters. A lot was riding on this movie. The standard screed regarding female superheroes (we can't refer to them as ""superheroines"" anymore) in film is that ... for some unknown reason... they fall short at the box office. There is a great resistance to acknowledging that—surprise!—superhero comics are primarily read by boys. Boys' interest in superheroes is a part of growing up, anticipating their entry into manhood; a way to vicariously imagine themselves as ideals of manly heroism.<br/><br/>Feminists eagerly anticipated this movie. After all, Wonder Woman is the mother of all female superheroes. They were hoping for a glass-ceiling event. A movie to level the playing field and show once and for all that men bear no inherent athletic superiority to women and boys should hold no monopoly on superhero movies. And when it was announced that a woman would direct it (Patty Jenkins) ... well!<br/><br/>But spearheading an attack across No-Man's Land in the Belgian Front, drubbing armed German soldiers as well as thugs in London, and chafing against the oppression of women in ""modern"" society is insufficient. She isn't a sexually aggressive, preferably lesbian, full-time advertisement for feminist righteous indignation at everything male. Additionally, she is designed to satisfy male concepts of female beauty.<br/><br/>Furthermore, she's white—and horror-of-horrors!—falls in love with a man.<br/><br/>What we got instead was a love story. A story with the message that love redeems mankind. The story of a man's love for a demi-goddess, and her love for mankind—and the most bitter pill of all—a woman's love for a man.<br/><br/>The ultimate message is one of love. That may sound trite these days —especially considering the turn taken by the DC movie franchises lately—but it is proving welcome to movie-goers and critics alike.<br/><br/>Feminists will have to be content with the first successful female superhero movie, directed by a woman no less, that redeems a franchise. Sorry if it's not enough. I loved it.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is not a perfect film. There's plenty to criticize. But any flaws are more than made up for by a new screen star that commands your complete attention every moment she is on-screen. I look forward to more Gal Gadot Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>( Full review at http://3rd-rail.net/2017 )"
"kkokkolatos","9","7","16","10 June 2017"," That was definitely UNEXPECTED
","Wonder Woman was a DC film which I believed, before the time I watched it, that it sucked. Yes, once again, I was mistaken. <br/><br/>The plot is not complicated but it remains interesting and attractive. There's a great twist too, something that fits perfectly and helps the movie to move to the very end. An end strong, violent and full of powerful feelings. There's action and passion. <br/><br/>Another very strong element of WW was the characters. Despite other superheroes films, this had a strong influence on you because of the characters. Wonder Woman is such a passionate and true character. Her style is magical and leads to addiction. She's kind and realistic, powerful and full of love and spiritual brilliance. So, welldone! You made a capable protagonist, who I can't wait to see again! Steve was also nice. He was pretty smart. Often, characters like him in other movies, have very poor lines and suck on dialogues. Steve's different. He's calm and allows the feeling to control him. This man is brave and loyal to WW.<br/><br/>The villain-ploTwist was amusing. He could be better but still, Ares, did not disappointed me. Strong and powerful as a God, was a perfect enemy for WW. He was cunning and not dull or empty in his inside world. Ares had his own way of being evil. <br/><br/>I want to mention that has nothing to do with the Greek mythology. <br/><br/>Gal Gadot..., was pure. She got into the role. She created a WW with upcoming promises. She is astonishing, marvelous and beautiful. Furious and angry. Good job!<br/><br/>Closing, in my opinion, WW is the best DC film after the trilogy of Batman. Also, for me always, it is as good as the Avengers but more mature and real!"
"nzswanny","8","7","16","6 June 2017"," Emotional and well-directed, this visual feast shows us the true horrors of war.
","Wonder Woman is truly a wonder with real emotion, fantastic action sequences and stable structure, altogether satisfying in one big, great bundle. The film shows Wonder Woman, an Amazon who wants to stop the Great War between mankind, and on the way she witnesses the true mankind, along with the sheer horror of war. The first twenty minutes are a bit uneven as they introduce Wonder Woman and the island she was born on, and as they witness mankind approach them, but after all that the film is completely steady and knows when to pull the heart- strings, and the emotion is never forced or sentimental, but pure truthful. That's what makes this film so good, is that we see the war and we see Wonder Woman's heart-ache as she watches people die right before her, and we feel her heart-ache as well while Wonder Woman wonders, ""Why don't we do more?"" <br/><br/>I don't think this film deserves 10/10 because the film's first twenty minutes was uneven, like I said before, and that there was a bit too much CGI in the action sequences. Despite that, this film succeeds in style and substance as we watch her in slow-motion defeating the opponents like the warrior she is. You can definitely tell that this film was directed by Patty Jenkins, as this film is subtly talented behind all those action sequences we watch. The action sequences are a bit extreme, yes. But if you look beyond those action sequences, you see a good film, one that will be remembered for the years to come. In the future, you'll talk about how you saw this film, and how it was like to witness it at the cinema. It's really that good.<br/><br/>But, of course, the film has it's cons, which I stated before. The reason why I'm stating this again is because the cons may get in the way of your viewing experience and disrupt the good. I don't want that to happen. If you can look away from those cons that stick out like a sore thumb, you'll absolutely love it, but those cons may just be a sharp stab in the back for the less tolerable. If you are completely difficult to satisfy when it comes to film, then I recommend not watching this. Otherwise, I'm sure you'll have a blast and a thought-provoking experience at the same time as we watch moral and the true meaning of human. 8.2/10."

","It been quite some time since I have gone back to the theater to review a movie. It nice to come back with something that was this great and this enjoyable like Wonder Woman. <br/><br/>First thing I would like to say is this movie touched me and made me feel so much better about the world we live in. It shows that in a world of darkness and depression like the rest of the DCEU has shown that we can get a film that shows that there is hope in our world and that there is hope in this franchise to truly be better than what it is now. <br/><br/>This is what Superman really should be. So I wasn't shocked when I heard that Patty Jenkins models this movie of the original Superman films cause it really felt like that. There was so much love and care put into crafting who these characters really were at there core and that I really found myself connecting to. Each character was given such personality and felt like real live human beings. <br/><br/>You can also feel Geoff Johns influence all over the film I would not be shocked at all if he was actually also writing the movie and juts chose to be uncredited cause this feels like something he would write. <br/><br/>Chris Pine as Steve Trevor was such a stand out in this film. He was really one awesome character and was awesome to see a male in a movie about feminism still be shown like this. It helps male audiences and female audiences to be able to see each other as equals and not be radicalized like the Ghostbusters movie did. <br/><br/>Speaking of which this is the way feminism needs to be done. This is the way that it needs to be executed. Showing a female character as a individual and also showing that she can stand besides her male counterparts. This movie does such a good job of making great and empowering statements that I think any woman can very much connect to. I mean I am no female myself, but I could see that maybe happening in this film. <br/><br/>A lot of critics are hampering on the third act. And I don't see why. The third act I feel is very much needed and is what adds so much power to the film and the message it is trying to convey to the viewer that you really have to have it there. It is a really powerful climax and also a really epic one that I think you will enjoy. <br/><br/>Overall I would highly recommend Wonder Woman to anyone. No matter who you are.I think there is a lot for you to enjoy."

"yvonneshusband","9","7","16","5 June 2017"," The Second Best Superhero Origin Story Yet!
","In my humble opinion, comic book movies work best when they don't take themselves too seriously. With the (possible) exception of 'The Dark Knight' and 'X-Men: First Class' , every 'realistic' CBM to date has foundered on the ridiculousness of the basic idea of super beings in garish costumes interacting with the 'real' world. 'Wonder Woman' never makes that mistake. From its opening in the mythical land of the Amazons, through equally 'mythical' versions of London and the Western Front in late 1918 (although I'm almost certain that the photograph that a certain B Wayne finally returns to Diana at the start of the movie was stated as having been taken in 1917 in BvS) to the somewhat clichéd CGI showdown between Diana and Ares at the end, the movie remains true to the spirit of its comic book source.<br/><br/>Keeping things as spoiler free as possible, the Amazons idyll of leather-clad workouts and combat training is rudely interrupted by the arrival of Allied spy Steve Trevor in a crashing Fokker monoplane, hotly pursued by ship-borne German troops. I must confess, I was so distracted by the similarities between this setup and the one in 'The Land that Time Forgot' that I didn't question the mechanics of following an aeroplane in a ship, nor did I notice that the ship either turns around and leaves after the Germans lose a pitched battle against the Amazons, or it spontaneously sinks, as it simply disappears from the movie at this point. Anyway, as a result of personal tragedy, or Steve Trevor's description of 'The War to End Wars', or both, Diana decides that Ares (Greek god of war, and the last of the Greek gods in the movie, for some reason) must be behind the slaughter of millions in this pointless conflict. So she and Trevor head for London, thence to Belgium and a showdown with General Eric Ludendorff (a real life historical personage), who is frantically searching for a new weapon to renew the German offensive before the Armistice can be negotiated (placing the events of the movie in late 1918, presumably after the failure of the 'Michael' offensive and the defeat of Austria/Hungary). Along the way, Diana discovers the true extent of her powers, refuses to conform to the restrictions placed on women by the conventions of the late-nineteenth/early twentieth century and puts Ares back in his box (until the inevitable sequel, presumably).<br/><br/>Suffice to say, Gal Gadot is a perfect Diana, very much cast in the mould of Christopher Reeve's Superman, or Chris Evan's Captain America; her limitations as an actress actually serving the straightforward moral certainty of the comic book heroine she is playing. Chris Pine is terrific as Steve Trevor, (almost) playing him as Captain Kirk suddenly finding that he's become Lois Lane. The supporting cast are uniformly good, although Danny Huston's Ludendorff is probably a little too much of an 'Indiana Jones' style Nazi (or, having quickly scanned his Wikipedia entry...) for a movie set in the First World War! But it's only a minor quibble, just like the anachronistic Native American sidekick, everyone, Germans included, using what look suspiciously like British WWII era gas masks, the portrayal of Douglas Haig as a one-dimensional, indifferent, callous warmonger and the already excessively (IMHO) criticized murky CGI finale, which at least remains true to the medium of comic books. The film ends with Diana's 'mission statement' as Wonder Woman, to save the world through the female principle (or 'love' as the dialogue puts it); no problem with that, it's been identified as a central theme of Wagner's Ring Cycle, after all. But unfortunately, the preceding two hours don't really establish any distinction between Diana's feminine brand of villain clobbering and the masculine variety. But then, it is a comic book movie, after all. View it as that, and enjoy!"
"parin-mirani","8","7","16","1 June 2017"," Wonderful Wonder Woman
","Wonder Woman is such a wonderful film, and even more wonderful is Gal Gadot who portrays the role of Amazon Princess Diana AKA Wonder Woman. One wonders why it took such a long time for this movie to be made. And then you remember the WhatsApp forward – It takes 6 hours to build a Toyota car but it takes 6 months to build a Rolls Royce. At last the wait is over. We get to see the Wonder Woman Origin story on the big screen - a film that fans will enjoy from start to end. The movie starts with a simple request, Diana is asked on how she became the Hero that she is and that's how we get to know her story. Diana was a rebellious kid and was always attracted to the art of fighting. Her mother was against it, but she gives up in the face of Diana's persistence. Diana is trained by Antiope, who is not only her aunt but also the best warrior of the troops of Themyscia. Here in a matter of few minutes we get to see Diana's transformation as a warrior. Then all of a sudden, a plane crashes with Steve Trevor inside it; he is being hunted by the German Army. What follows is a battle between German Soldiers and warrior women of Themyscira. This shakes up Diana and she decides leave home, go to the outside world and end all wars. Now we will see some fish-out-of-water moments which Diana undergoes, when she has to adjust herself to the outside world. Some scenes are funny and you will fall in love with Diana's innocence while she is getting used to the world. Soon her battle with the outside world begins and we get to see Diana as Wonder Woman. I got Goosebumps throughout this scene. Wonder Woman is a well-made movie. It's an action movie with some funny and romantic moments, which don't go overboard. Like how Dawn of Justice felt like it was shot in Noir/grey mode, this movie will expose you to the Sepia mode. One should realize that these modes set the tone of the movie. Effects are good and don't look over the top. Pace is bit uneven but it doesn't matter much. Rupert Gregson- Williams' score compliments both action and non-action scenes. Tina Guo's cello gives aggression to the Wonder Woman theme, originally composed by Hans Zimmer in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. In terms of performance, all supporting actors have done justice to their roles. I wish Robin Wright had got some more screen time. Chris Pine plays Steve Trevor who handholds Diana when out of her comfort zone and is also her love interest. Now let's talk about Gal Gadot. She fills up the role of Wonder Woman with the soul it deserves; you can feel her struggle, strength, innocence & love. When she was cast as Wonder Woman, it received lot of criticism, but after watching this movie I can say that she has proved herself with her stunning performance. There is a scene where she feels a snowfall for the first time and her astonishment is so genuine that one can relate to it. (Four months ago I experienced snow for the first time and I had a similar reaction.) Her expressions while she is having ice cream for the first time or while wearing glasses are so innocent that you see a child in a woman who is a born warrior. Her muscles are toned, not bulky but visible enough to display the physical training Wonder Woman has received from childhood. She has carried herself effortlessly in all the costumes. You can also see how much effort Gal has put in for all the action scenes when you see her fighting. In short she nails the role of Wonder Woman. This movie is not about war but it is about taking measures to stop it. War is created by someone who can't see people happy and wants to manipulate them with hideous intentions. Verdict: 4/5"

"benjwhite","7","3","5","31 December 2019"," A well-made, well-intentioned, action-hero story
","I recently re-watched this movie on a flight home from vacation. What stood out to me the most during the movie was the valid and nearly-complete attempt at displaying and exploring the moral motivations and expectations of Diana (the moderately well-done performance of Gal Gadot).<br/><br/>On this line of thinking, the movie sets itself above many other superhero movies. It does so much more to show the ignorance with which she holds her power for most of the movie, while showing the enlightenment, as it were, at the end. (On another, note, writing from hindsight, I'm sad that this seems to be the only movie DC has done well in this regard in the last 5-10 years.)<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film loses me in the action-flick style. I think the problem comes from high expectations on my part. I wish that the movie had made even further conflict to completely show Diana's transformation from the doe-eyed curiosity when Steve Trevor (the talented Chris Pine) landed on her island, starting the plot of the movie, to the final moments when she realizes that man would continue to fight despite Ares' death.<br/><br/>This movie will hold acclaim for many years after its release because it is a well-made movie featuring a powerful and independent woman as its protagonist. Gal Gadot was a good choice for the role, playing the part as the dashing and attractive goddess rather well. However, whether this was intentional throughout the movie or not, I felt that she held very few expressions throughout the movie. While she was quite good at showing the ignorance of her character towards the intentions of man, I felt that other emotions were missing from her performance. Whether this was intentional, I'm not sure, but my gut feeling tells me that there were missed opportunities for Gadot to truly step into the role.<br/><br/>Overall, I am very happy that DC decided to put its best foot forward when it came to this character. I believe that it is a welcome step in to helping establish that our superheros, no matter how fake, are of the same composition as most of us. More specifically, that women can--and are--just as badass as men."
"funtasticfour","8","3","5","16 July 2019"," One of the better DC movies!
","First of all, Gal Gadot is perfect in the role, and a treat to watch. Secondly, when I first saw this in the theatre, I quite enjoyed it up until the end, where I felt overwhelmed my computer effects. That part didn't seem to bother me as much at home, and I'm glad for that, because the first half of the movie is great, and then it downturns a bit but is still pretty good. I would love to see more of Paradise Island, because that, and Wonder Woman on the battlegrounds, were the best two parts. So basically, I'd love to see more stunt work than special effects."
"Bobby_McMahon","9","3","5","18 March 2019"," Great work from Patty Jenkins
","Having watched Gal Gadot a lot during the few Fast and Furious films she was in, as soon as she was announced as the new Wonder Woman I knew I was going to go see it and I loved it. Everyone has different opinions but considering before this film DC gave us Batman v Superman, were the only good things in it were Lex Luther and funnily enough, Wonder Woman, I am quite surprised at some the negative reviews for this film. With two great main cast members in Gal Gadot and Chris Pine and a good plot focusing on the war to end all wars and Diane's growth into a warrior as well as her hunt to find Ares so she can end the war, this film was thoroughly enjoyable and I can't for the second film next summer"

"Dawg!","9","3","5","27 March 2018"," Comic book adaptation plus so much more.
","I'm curious as to why so many negative reviews appear here. Then again, everyone is entitled to an opinion, so here's mine.<br/><br/>This film seems to me to run a bit long; however, it's action-packed and keeps your attention. It's not the typical thing that most movie-makers trot out when adapting a comic book or graphic novel; instead, it takes a fresh look at a superhero that we're ostensibly familiar with.<br/><br/>Some of the details have been changed with this incarnation of Wonder Woman - a World War I backstory with Steve Trevor rather than the World War II origin story that comic book readers might be familiar with - however; the ""bones"" of the story are fully intact. <br/><br/>Highbrow entertainment? It's not exactly something you would expect to see on Masterpiece Theater Classic on a Sunday night in winter. But then again, it isn't meant to be that. It's fast paced, entertaining, lots of things that go boom; yet it's also a story that keeps you engaged and makes you care about what happens to the characters in the end.<br/><br/>Put succinctly: it's an action movie that has a lot of really good moments. In my humble opinion, it's probably the best (as of March 2018) DC Extended Universe movie of the bunch. 
(I'll admit, I wasn't a fan of ""Batman vs. Superman"", and ""Man of Steel"" just moved a little too slowly for my taste.)"
"sebijin","9","3","5","13 March 2018"," Best film in the DCEU
","After watching the awful ""Suicide Squad,"" I got the chance to rewatch the amazing ""Wonder Woman.""<br/><br/>This was the first DCEU film that I had watched and I had the pleasure of seeing it in theaters. It's a great standalone film and it never had the need to connect with the rest of the DCEU - which is what the DCEU needed.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot plays a fantastic Wonder Woman. The first 2/3rds of this film are near perfect. There's great chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine, as Steve Trevor. The world of Themiscyra was breathtaking. The comedy, while sparse, was funny.<br/><br/>I really love this film.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't enjoy about it was the villain. He's just bad. There's a twist that happens in regards to the villain and that was fine, but it still wasn't great. If the third act had been better, this could have been closer to a 10/10 for me.<br/><br/>There's very few people I wouldn't recommend ""Wonder Woman"" to - go watch it!"
"jasonhadlow1","9","3","5","8 March 2018"," A pleasant surprise
","Don't usually go for this genre of film, in fact I hate superheroes, however, seeing as how it had a 5* review on Sky I thought I'd at least put it on for 5 minutes and see if all the hype was right. 2 and a bit hours later, I've just witnessed a rather compelling romp! Unlike Cruises The Mummy which is 2 hours of my life I'll never get back or Riviera which totalled 6, this actually sped me through a rather enjoyable evening. I can't see myself buying the 'Directors Cut' on DVD but I'd certainly recommend it above a whole host of 10* dross peddled by the mindless teens hanging out on the IMDB forum! There, my first review, hop you all like it!"
"beekaycarter","7","3","5","27 November 2017"," Politics, No Wonder.
","Whether you want to admit this or not, and yes, I already imagine, there is a 99.9% chance you won't want to admit it... probably even 100%; Take the story of Wonder Woman as it is, exactly, but change the title to Wonder Man, make the lead a male, and change the director from a female to a male, and this film's rating will drop from 92% from critics, to 62%... And less people would be calling it the best thing since sliced bread.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is not a bad movie by any means, but it is nowhere near what it has been made out to be... Not even close. A wasted villain, a very familiar story, a gorgeous Gal Gadot who has limited acting range, but perfect for the role of Wonder Woman nonetheless and terrible CGI.<br/><br/>This movie was a chess move on a political board. It's nothing new, groundbreaking or long lasting... It was what it was. Chris Pine was awesome, the story, though familiar, was nice.<br/><br/>It may seem like I'm bashing Wonder Woman, but I'm not, I'm just highlighting all the very obvious shortcomings that everybody seems to want to ignore... But just because you ignore them, doesn't mean they aren't there.<br/><br/>I mean, just to further prove the political and feminist game that is being played here, Warner Bros. want Wonder Woman to be considered for the Academy's Best Screenplay, Best Director and Best Actress categories. Them being considered for any of those categories is laughable at best, but I wouldn't be surprised if it happened.<br/><br/>I give it 7/10, not because it has a female lead and a female director... I give it that because that is what it earned."
"domonkos-horvath","4","12","32","6 June 2017"," Another Suicide Squad level movie.
","The first and last 15 minutes of the movie are worth watching, it's the tedious middle part that completely ruins everything, but even the good parts are not without issues.<br/><br/>Done to death one liners delivered with an annoying accent by an annoyingly naive character - all of this wrapped in a flat performance - but Instead of a cold hard reality check, reality is distorted to entertain the delusions of this woman, whose entire scope of knowledge about humanity comes from 3 thousand year old Greek fairy tales.<br/><br/>The script is even more mediocre than usual, the issues presented are entirely unrelatable, thus failing to engage the viewer - or at least this viewer - on any level. Whenever I am presented with something that is supposed to get an emotional response out of me it eventually feels like a botched effort for various reasons. One instance fails to be impactful, so I feel like I'm watching a seminar where some statistics are mentioned, another is stating the obvious so plainly, I feel like I'm watching a recap of the movie instead of the movie itself. There's one distinctly Greek thing this movie doesn't have, but should have adopted before anything else: the makes of a good drama.<br/><br/>I have a particular and very subjective criticism about one thing. When German people talk among themselves, they speak English with a blatantly fake German accent. This is not Assassin's Creed, where half of the movie ended up being Spanish, in this movie it would have been perfectly fine to hear authentic German language and read subtitles for those 10 minutes.<br/><br/>And last but not least: The last time CG physics made me chuckle like this was when I watched Tyrannosaurus Azteca, a 2.9 rated movie on a $2.5 mil budget. Now that movie is so bad it's good. This movie is just bad."

Gal Gadot is simply amazing and would like to see her in more movies specially in comedy as well as serious role, not sure about the romantic movies though. Now coming to the part where a lot of fan always debate at, that's the dark vs light. I think this movie has found the perfect balance between the two.

","If you are the sort of puppy that likes to watch buff females wrestling each other in their skimpies, this may well be the movie for you. God knows what Margaret Court would've thought about it, although I suspect that this is exactly the sort of thing she secretly likes whilst hiding her true feelings behind an interpretation of ancient text.<br/><br/>Wunder WOOMAN! is an Amazon and is descended from Zeus who bred them (Amazons) to look after the world if his brother Ares recovers from the mother of all floggings and decides to make mischief.<br/><br/>A British spy who is an American (before the days when American spies revealed their ineptitude) crashes his German plane near an island that is perpetually clouded in, but isn't, perhaps surprisingly, inhabited by a giant ape. Instead it is inhabited by Amazons. It's a pretty nice island. Not as nice as Lord Howe, but. <br/><br/>It's WWI<br/><br/>Anyway the spy is chased in by Germans who know that he isn't really one of them, and they have guns and the Amazons have skimpies so you can imagine how this ends. But Diana, Wunder WOOMAN! can go a bit and she takes on the Germans as is doing alright too but has to be saved by the British spy who is an American in a German plane.<br/><br/>He tells her about the war to end all wars and she decides that Zeus' brother Ares is likely the culprit, and, dammit, she's going to put an end to this nonsense.<br/><br/>There are all laughs aplenty when Diana is first exposed to WWI London. Baby-making (tee-hee) is explained, her steel undies are a sensation and baddies are thrashed mercilessly when they do a bit of recreational ogling.<br/><br/>Diana and her merry band (think Hogan's Heroes) head off to the front to show Jerry just who's boss and in so doing demonstrate a compassion to refugees that, in her days in the IDF, would have been deemed treasonous.<br/><br/>My mind was wandering at this stage and I wondered, idly in the manner of such wanderings, how she cut her underarm hair? In a similar vein I wondered why Daenerys Targaryen's hair didn't burn, although I think in that case I may have detected some charring as I freeze-framed through. Enough of that.<br/><br/>The is a villain called Dr. Poison who has, apparently, cut herself rather badly when shaving, and General Ludendorff who has a drug habit. There are snipers. There is poison gas! All the bad things are as a result of the Germans. The hero is an American! How times have changed.<br/><br/>'Wunder WOOMAN' is kitted out with a magic shield, a lariat, a sword, and bracelets (don't cross the bracelets!)<br/><br/>There are adventures, sort-of-pathos (which goes on for ages and ages and AGES and makes you wonder what is a safe bladder level) baddies and rock-jawed goodies. The hero is a heroine and that's a plus. She looks a bit like Kim Kardashian and that's a not so good thing.<br/><br/>Is it any good? Not really. On the scale 1-10 where 'Interstellar' is 1, and 'Starship Troopers' is a 10, it's about a 5. Prolly wouldn't see a sequel, even at Seniors discount prices. My wife didn't think much of it either."
"samyoung-82648","3","12","33","6 June 2017"," Utter Hyper-Violent Garbage
","This film is a huge let down. Gal Gadot has ruined what Lynda Carter excelled at. Wonder Woman was never about glorified, unnecessary violence. She was a voice of reason, compassion and restrained strength. Gal is none of these. She is no hero and she's an appalling role model. Ignoring physical strength, she's not strong, she's not logical in her reasoning and her feats set fans up for a huge downfall with an unrealistic ""hero"" (to quote the press).<br/><br/>This movie is filled with violence and most of it is unnecessary. Yes, we get it, girl power, right? The idea is that more violence is supposedly better, or something along those lines. This movie is another bore fest along the same lines as most of the marvel movies. There is nothing intelligent, fresh or clever (except the violence is even more over the top than any other comic conversion movie).<br/><br/>The story from beginning to end is illogical and almost incoherent. A group of hyper warrior females who don't do anything constructive (eg. farming) aggressively battle each other day and night. It's not clear why they do this because when the going gets tough, they refuse to fight, except with a group of German soldiers who they attack before they even know they are enemies. These types of illogical double standards continue throughout the entire movie. Violence is really awesome when it suits the story, but it's occasionally abhorred when it's an elderly grandmother. As a largely peaceful person, I found the logic of violence worship very disturbing (despite the media frenzy about needing extreme violence to represent ""female heroes"").<br/><br/>There is not a single actor whose performance I enjoyed. Gal was a huge let down. Flipping between empathy and aggression indiscriminately. Chris Pine played the fragile ""handsome"" man who was too busy hero worshipping a false god. Across the entire cast, I can't think of a single memorable performance.<br/><br/>If you get your rocks off on meaningless gratuitous violence (and bucket loads of it), you'll love this movie. If you don't care about meaningful characters or a coherent plot, even better. Everyone else - save your money. This is the worst movie i've seen this year. If this is what society deems the new breed of ""hero"", then it's a very sad indictment indeed."

","It feels like people are just giving this movie a good amount of stars because it's on a feminist agenda. I wanted this movie to be good. But that is not the case. This movie was poorly made in nearly all aspects. The story is not bad, but the way they shot and portrayed it is bad. Every fight was in CGI and it was bad CGI. Motion blur was a mess. There was a scene that looked like it was filmed in 144p with added blur. Near the en of the movie there was a scene including a green-screen that was so bad that you could see the feathering around the edges of Ares head. The dialog sometimes made me angry. It bestowed upon she not listening and constantly talking while his dialog was ""I... i... i.. i... under... i ... under...""

","I had heard some really good things about this movie, so I was obviously excited to see the film. After I came out of the theatre I couldn't understand what all the fuzz is about. The movie is just OK. I think it is closer to being bad than good.<br/><br/>The acting is good. Most of the actors do a very good job in portraying their characters. The only two actors who I believe were miscast were Robin Wright and David Thewlis as Sir Patrick.<br/><br/>Robin Wright just looked ridiculous dressed like that and doing ""stunts"" ( or better yet a CGI version of her). And David just made me feel sad for him, he was terribly miscast and his character was laughably bad.<br/><br/>The action scenes in the movie are mediocre. They are full of pretty bad CGI and slo-mo ""money shots"" (trying to look like 300). It was very sad to see how they have an actress like Gal Gadot that is an army veteran and knows how to fight, being replaced by a bad CGI version of her.<br/><br/>I must admit, there are some parts in the action scenes that were pretty cool, specially a fight in London.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is pretty slow and had me pretty bored, it was really boring to see all the exposition and the Amazonian world. Actually, I was looking at my watch for whole run-time of the film.<br/><br/>The relationship between the characters was good enough and believable. But there was a big problem, the movie failed in making me care for any character except Wonder Woman. When a character died, I really didn't care about it. I will give it this, I was glad someone died in a superhero movie.<br/><br/>The ending was terrible though. It was a CGI culsterf*ck that reminded me of BvS. It was really unexciting and completely ruined the message of the film. And the final shot... it was so cringeworthy.<br/><br/>I did enjoyed the ""feminist"" aspect of the film. I was expecting this movie to have extreme feminism and make all the male characters stupid or assh*les while the female characters are perfect. But the movie actually makes both male and female characters relatable and competent.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie was just mediocre. It is nothing impressive and i wouldn't pay a ticket to watch it."

"ventingace","10","9","23","4 June 2017"," A Masterpiece.
","I don't usually write reviews even though I'm an avid movie-goer, but this movie feels like it is worth it. Although I didn't come out of the theater jumping in excitement, the more time I spent thinking about Wonder Woman, the more I respected and appreciated it. It grew on me *after* watching it, as I had more and more time to think about it and realize what a masterpiece it is. The movie breaks numerous boundaries for both superhero movies and for movies in general. I'm not one for deep analysis; I go to the movies for one thing only: to be entertained. This movie literally had ONE boring scene in it, and that is the bar scene where they chat (great time for restroom break.) Other than that, it was action-packed, humorous, and amazingly directed. The first half of the movie is about Diana of Themyscira and how she came to be, as well as setup for the second half. One of my favorite scenes from any movie of all time takes place here, when the Amazonians defend their land from the Germans (not a spoiler, don't worry.) Then comes the second half, where it gets action-PACKED. Amazing fight scenes, *wonder*ful music, and I don't usually say this, but brilliantly written. I found myself almost crying at some parts, and stifling laughter in others. The actors, cinematographers, visual effects team, and director all did a superb job and they are the real heroes here. This was an amazing movie, take my word for it, and if you like anything I mentioned above, you'll enjoy Wonder Woman."
"carly_hope","10","9","23","5 June 2017"," It passed the Bechdel test!
","And that definitely isn't the only positive about this wonder-movie. <br/><br/>It is a well told origin story. It tells us where Diana is coming from, how she became who she is and why she's doing what she's doing. It paints a very clear picture. It makes you invested. Diana is the main focus but we get a sense of who the main supporting characters are as well. Especially Steve Trevor who is treated way better by the script than his female counterparts from similar movies. I really liked the merry band of misfits accompanying Diana on her quest. They gave both a face and perspective to the war and to humanity. Etta was my favorite. <br/><br/>The casting was amazing as well. Gal Gadot gave Diana strength, certain arrogance coming from trusting one's abilities but also innocence, naivety and vulnerability. Chris Pine was charming as a spy should be while not threatened at all by Diana's abilities and his feelings for her. And the Big Bad? Maybe I should have figured it out on my own but I like surprises, so why bother. They were sufficiently threatening and it was easy to understand and fear their monstrosity. <br/><br/>The action sequences were really cool as well. Though there were a couple of instances where the CGI was a little too on the nose. My favorite was the very first fight on the beach. So beautiful and heartbreaking. <br/><br/>Visually it was also very appealing. The costumes, scenery, camera work. And also the music was well picked. <br/><br/>Overall, it was everything one could wish for from such a movie. Compelling story-telling, interesting multi-dimensional characters, humor and emotions, stunning visuals. Well done, girls, well done."
"pressboard","10","9","23","4 June 2017"," Perffect!
","This is the best Superhero debut I have seen since Superman (Christopher Reeve version) from the 80's. From the casting (Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman) to the music (Hans Zimmer & Tom Holkenborg) this movie never misses a beat. The Amazonian warrior (Amazons of Themsycira) race was done to perfection. There is no doubt from watching their training to battle that these are some serious ***kickers. A lot more impressive than the Thor debut. This movie has a lot of emotion from the fairly light romance between Wonder Woman and the pilot Steve Trevor to Wonder Woman's relationship with her mother Hippolyta. There is a fair amount of humor as Diana (Wonder Woman) navigates the early 40's time period including sexism and women's very restricted roles. There is a great scene where she lays into the British Commander with some well placed criticism. All of the actors do incredible work making their characters real and sympathetic and I have to give kudos to the writers as well. It doesn't get any better than this."

","I went to this flick with an open and expectant mind, excited by all the positive reviews by both critics and users here. I must say I was disappointed. Other than two or three good CGI-intensive scenes, I found the dialogue corny, the writing puerile. I still think Christopher Reeve's ""Superman"" remains the gold standard for this kind of superhero movie, and ""Wonder Woman"" doesn't come close. But again, at age 77, perhaps I have just aged out of this genre."

","I went to see Wonder Woman with my oldest daughter yesterday. I must confess that I am not a fan of super heroes movies, buy, boy, how did I miss Heath's joker and Nolan's direction while watching that movie! The fights are OK, the editing is good, the special effects are good, but the story is very poor and predictable, and the acting of Super Woman (who is a beautiful and an amazing athletic model) is awful. She is really good at running, jumping and fighting, which is great, but that's it.<br/><br/>The worst, in my opinion, is that the Germans are speaking... English! How awful is that! Hello? We are in 2017! From the 40s until the 90s everybody was speaking English in the American movies, despite of being French, German, Russian, or Spanish characters... and that is something I really cannot stand. It is SO fake! But now we have many good movies with Germans speaking German, French speaking French, Russians speaking Russian, and Spanish speaking Spanish. What? Americans can't read subtitles? Come on! The director could not find German actors? Give me a break! Also, the ""Germans"" in ""Wonder Woman"" have like 10 lines maximum. So, how terrible it is to read 10 lines of subtitles? Or, if the director only wanted these specific actors: these actors could not speak 10 lines of German? That was so fake and low. For me, the worst.<br/><br/>All the Amazon women are amazing fighters. That's super nice. But then when they talk they look like those women who appear in anti-age creme commercials or fashion commercials... all so fake.<br/><br/>The story is very predictable and the characters are not well defined. With all, it is an OK movie for teenagers: the nicest thing is that, for once, the women are the ones fighting!<br/><br/>The editing is good (1 point), the special effects are good (1 point), the fights are good (1 point), and the fact that the women are the strong ones is really cool (2 points) (the rest... meh) = 5/10."

","Wonder Woman looks at a photo and has a flashback. This film is the flashback and the introduction of Wonder Woman who has already appeared in the film series. It starts with her as a young girl among the Amazons with her destiny to defeat Ares, the god of war. She meets Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) a British spy and together they attempt to stop WWI. Her mission is to stop wars.<br/><br/>I thought the film was better than ""Thor"", but not nearly as good as ""Iron Man"". I liked the action, dialogue, and special effects. The film looks at the dark side of humanity. It reminded me of Chomsky when he asks what an alien would think looking at mankind. That is what we get with the goddess Diana (Gal Gadot.). The island scenes must have been a goldmine for stunt women.<br/><br/>On the negative side, I was confused by the various accents of the Amazons. Diana's mom didn't have one, while her aunt had one. As a child and teen Diana doesn't have an accent. As an adult she does. Must be that Macedonia thing we saw in ""Alexander."" I thought Chris Pine was under whelming, i.e. less than average. I only like him in about half of his roles and this wasn't the half. Gal Gadot was good, I thought her fire and passion could have come out better. Personally I would have rather seen J-Law in that role and it is not as if we haven't replaced super heroes between films. The climax battle was too long and I said the same about first ""Iron Man"" too. I think it is a generational thing where I know how it turns out, so let's get back to the story. And speaking of stories...where was Diana during WWII?<br/><br/>Random 6 AM tweets: The Greek and Norse gods are real by the stories, do they ever clash? What I really wanted to see was a cameo of Bruce Willis curled up in the trenches (""12 Monkeys"").<br/><br/>Guide: No swearing. Chis Pine is naked but covers up his ""above average."""

This movie is as good as any Spiderman(I think 2 is the best) and Superman(again 2 is the best) and in some ways breaks new ground. I have 5 reasons to give it a 10. 1.The opening scene (a faded photo from millionaire Batman Bruce Wayne no less) ties in to an excellent scene 2/3 of the way through the movie and adds continuity where they take pictures like so many WW1 pictures I see in the daily Mail every day 2.It is the first time I have seen a superhero in a real life situation.. the Green Goblin or Doctor Octopus are not real but WW1 is real and even Ludendorff is real. For that reason alone it is ground breaking 3. If you have seen ""Paths of Glory"" or ""All Quiet.."" you know what ""over the top"" means. To see Wonder Woman go over the top is amazing, and the fact that Steve(love interest) says ""she is taking all the fire..let's go"" makes it even better. I could watch that scene all day.<br/><br/>4 The scenes of London and the crossing to the continent ring true having seen ""Chariots of Fire"" and even Downton Abbey we know what carnage WW1 brought to the U.K and continent. The attention to detail is amazing<br/><br/>I want to see this again and fear that the director could not possibly see lightning strike twice is a sequel.

The story line was very interesting and there was a great chemistry between Chris Pine and Gal Gadot. All the supporting actors were excellent and the special effects were elaborate. Gal's fight scenes were downright interesting. I usually can tell which film's will be shown on TV year after year, and decade after decade.

","This was indeed an excellent movie. People ignore the critics and watch this movie. As a male the movie is not indulged in feminism but it was definitely a good balance between the genders. I think these actors were the right suit for the job. Excellent acting Gal brought life to the character, fun gorgeous down to earth. Chris Pine was spot on very humorous and made the movie blend with the chemistry of true friendship and relationship/sacrifice. What more do we want. As a male it is good to see a woman take on a strong female room. Young women today out there need encouragement and someone that can help them keep their head held up high. The action was great. Not over down. It blended really well with drama. It is no doubt it will be one of the best DC movies for a change. It was by far better than Man of Steel, Batman vs Superman. The only thing I may not have liked too strongly was the villain. It's not someone you would take seriously. They were some words repeated twice probably a mistake in the script but this is the time to show DC still has it as long as they have they equip themselves with the right actors. I found the beginning of her origin to be a little confusing as she said she was brought to life by Zeus. If you are strong on comic maybe you will forget about criticizing feminism in movies and cut to the chase. If you watch the older wonder woman series you will appreciate something a bit more modern. Go and see the movie. It is a much watch for the entire family. It may be long but it is one movie I guarantee will keep your awake. I am looking forward to see wonder woman again in the Justice League movie!. It is definitely a movie I would like to see be continued but most important you will not come out the theater dissatisfied but rather amaze you will feel this character had a purpose to fulfill. I no some guys will feel defended about a woman covering for guys in a war but it is just to show you we need each other. Enjoy the movie. All I can say is fun, dark and epic action and no doubt the right actress was chosen for the job. I enjoyed her a lot more in this movie than any other!"

","The structure of Wonder Woman is a hero's journey done perfectly right. We get to see how she grows up, learn to fight and finally get a call to adventure by the arrival of Steve Trevor. In the other world - that of the First World War - Wonder Woman must overcome both physical and spiritual challenges to finally become the hero that we met in the Batman V Superman movie. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman fills out the hero's role in Joseph Campbell's old monomyth with charm, intelligence and spirit. The central premise of the character is a belief in the good in all humans (and amazons). This belief is what is challenged during the movie. Which sets Wonder Woman apart from most other superhero movies, where it's all about the hero himself and his bad temper (Thor, Hulk), self worth (Batman Begins), health (Iron Man), inheritance (Man of Steel), love life (Spider-Man) and so forth. Even Captain America (First Avenger) is mostly about his belief in himself. Somehow everything else also works perfectly in this movie: Great locations (Italy for Themyscira, London as 1918 London), great supporting cast (Chris Pine, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright), just the right amount of comic relief (the 1918 men vs Wonder Woman, Steve Trevor's old friends), and a lot of really good action. The only slight problem I could find was the realism of a few of the war scenes. But nothing is that perfect."

And after the dreadful Suicide Squad, my thoughts were the only thing that can save this universe was Wonder Woman's solo film. I am pleased to say that this film has done just that.<br/><br/>I was a bit worried, given today's gender political climate, that we would be subjected to another preachy man-hating mess. I still have memories of the woeful Ghostbusters remake. But this movie is more concerned with uniting men and woman rather than dividing. There was no ill will towards us whatsoever. Instead, it showed the importance of Men and Woman working together while still acknowledging our flaws. Wonder Woman showed us her strength as well as her compassion. I know that there probably will be some who will find misandric undertones in this film, but I found the opposite."

","Most movies on this website's top 250 films are adaptions, be it a novel or a comic book or even another film. I am not a reader and never read comic books growing up so I am not biased when I watch adaptations which I strongly feel is one of the reasons Wonder Woman has 8.3/10 here and 93% on rotten tomatoes. If Wonder Woman was a spec script this film would not be trending. Until this film Angelina Jolie was the highest earning action Heroine at the US box office with Lara Croft (2001) $131 million. She also managed $118 million with Salt (2010). Scarlett Johanson achieved $126 million with Lucy (2014) and no other actress had been able to carry an action film entirely alone. Hunger games, Star Wars, Divergent and Terminator don't qualify because the male opposite were just as strong.<br/><br/>The other reason is that this film is directed by a Female. People love this film because it is the first time a Female director has worked with a big budget like this. $150 million. It has been long time coming. I hope female representation will improve from here on and it seems so because Ava Duvernay also achieved a milestone by becoming the first Black female director to direct an upcoming $100 million film also becoming the third overall behind Katherine Bigelow who did K-9 (2002) for $100 million.<br/><br/>I give this film 6/10 because there is nothing groundbreaking like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight. Its actually half that. Wonder Woman is just another superhero popcorn film whose Lead has an accent giving further evidence that Jews runs the World lol. Wonder Woman is played by Gal Gadot who I think is responsible for the financial success not the story or the CGI. She is genuinely funny, sexy and a great actor. I bet She and Chris Pine who plays the male lead will win the Best Duo at the 2018 MTV movie awards. As for Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen whose names are also on the poster they don't make it past the first ten minutes of the film which is fraud because I love Robin Wright."
"davor-filipan-zg","3","8","20","6 June 2017"," Did I saw the same movie as all those people who wrote positive reviews?!
","After reading all these positive and overwhelming reviews about this movie, I was really excited to see it in the cinema this Sunday. I prepared for the best and expected to see excellent or at least a really good move - but I got really disappointed. I even asked myself did I saw the same movie as all those people who wrote reviews online and in the local Croatian newspapers.<br/><br/>Wonder woman's characterization is OK (Gadot is – phew! – really attractive - she looks fabulous in her costume), she (as the character and actress) did well in Batman VS. Superman also, some of the fighting scenes are really nicely done, some scenes are visual nice and that's about it - that's all that is good in this movie. The story is one of worst superhero movie stories ever shown on the big screen. It has so many plot holes that even the best directors cut can not fix it. It literally cuts corners whenever it can. I don't mind at all that he movie is 'feminist' in a petty, trendy way, but I do mind when director and screen writers take the audience for idiots.<br/><br/>Every cloud has a silver lining, so I thought movie will be better towards the end - but I almost fell asleep during Diana's fight with Ares. The whole story with god of war and German general and Dr.Poison doesn't make any sense, and doesn't work on the big screen at all (as ti works well in the comic).<br/><br/>Last straw of the movie are the side characters that accompany Diana to the battle front. Some of the great actors play characters that are totally out of place and even time, and completely ruin the credibility of this movie (take in consideration that this is a movie about super heroes and credibility cant be it's strongest side).<br/><br/>To make a long story short - good visualisation of the Wonder woman is not enough to make a quality movie. It lacks everything else, and it might work for younger audience (children till the age of 13.) It is a shame that Hollywood keeps serving such bad and lousy movies.

","Let's face it, before Wonder Woman, all female superheroes movie are directed by men. Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot did Wonder Woman justice. The new way of how female superhero supposed to be. They even tackled the text book superhero principle well in gray reality (instead of black and white).<br/><br/>Wonder Woman as a movie is not lacking flaws, in fact there are quite a few to mention. However, this movie is enjoyable from female, male and children point of view. It has the making of a classique movie. Time will tell how it will be with the box office and critical reception.<br/><br/>My recommendation, just go and watch it. This is the first superhero movie that a couple can truly enjoy, a family can watch and discuss, and it left us with a sweet after taste. There are sad drama, romance, humour, a touch of horror, plenty of explosive actions, and surprises."

","It has been a long time since I saw a great movie. Wonder Woman has great actors, is well played, and establish the story of the character. I hope that all DCU movie who are coming will be that good. From a personal point of view, less slow-mo during the fight scene would have a better impact. Gal Gadot had a lot of challenges, a lot to carry on her shoulders. It's not anyone who can play Wonder Woman. She is a wonder in all department. More than a movie, it's a film."

","Having watched the previous dc films that were just about average, my expectations were pretty low going into this movie. But my oh my was I wrong.... This film is a masterpiece... i don't know about anyone else but personally I feel that other superhero movies should take notes from this film. It does everything right!!! It has a story that is both heart- wrenching and emotional as well as filled with optimism and hope. Well and what can I say about the action... just simply superb. This is one of of those movies that comes around once in a lifetime and leaves a lasting impact.... And Gal Gadot.... I think i'm in love!!! OMG she is so amazing, empowering, bad-ass and just drop-dead gorgeous!!! So once again DC congratulations!!! Hope to see many more great works of art like this in the future.... Cheers!!!"

","Wonder Woman is the film to make those scornful of the DCEU sit up and take notice. Patty Jenkins has crafted a film that will be enjoyed by people regardless of age and gender etc,<br/><br/>When Diana (as played by Gal Gadot) daughter of the Queen of the Amazons rescues American agent Steve (Chris Pine) from pursing German forces it is the start of an adventure that will see Diana make discoveries of many kinds.<br/><br/>Jenkins brings in many kinds of genres into the film that kick it up a notch from other entries in this field. There is course Action as Diana and Steve aim to stop a plot to change the course of WW1, the set pieces which see Diana take on multiple opponents at a time are eye catching. There is comedy in particular from Lucy Davis. And romance as Diana and Steve develops feelings for each other.<br/><br/>Gaadot is more that up to task of showing us the development of Diana as someone who goes from sheltered innocent to someone who is confronted with the harshness to the outside world.<br/><br/>As I said at the start of this review Wonder Woman has something for everyone."

What a pity the opening sequences had some interesting moments but like the entire film nothing gets into anything really worth while.<br/><br/>A huge crew a great director who's MONSTER was at moments brilliant and afforded its lead actor Charlize Theron a well deserved Oscar. Hollywood being sexist of course did not nominate Patty for an awards - so the story continues.<br/><br/>We don't hear from Patty until she makes a comic book action back female based movie. Lots of money lots of case and crew special effects the whole thing you would expect from an action film.<br/><br/>This is not art this is just awful. Can't blame anyone in particular this is what Hollywood is offering its stars talent and audiences. Big blockbuster destruction for big profits.<br/><br/>STOP IT JUST STOP IT.

","I finally managed to watch the highly praised ""Wonder Woman"" and I have to agree, a lot of the hype is justified. It's honestly the best D.C. Cinematic Universe movie, but then again, the other movies were pretty bad or disappointing. However, that doesn't take anything away from this movie, which is actually not only slightly better, but blows them out of the water in terms of quality.<br/><br/>The strength of ""Wonder Woman"" is Patty Jenkins' direction. She really knows how to make this world work and has a great sense of the character. She directs fight scenes that are not only visually stunning, but progress the story in a way that hasn't been done before in the DCCU. Setting the film during The Great War allows her to play around with gender norms and defy expectations, which plays into the humor and adds another level of appreciation of how far we've come. However, as great as she is, I think the movie could have been cut down as it does go on a bit too long. Plus the reveal of the villain at the end is kind of underwhelming and underdeveloped. But that doesn't take away from the fact that she made a movie that has edge of your seat action, well thought out main characters, and is a fun ride for the most part.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman played by Gal Gadot is great casting as she really does look the part. She looks so awesome in her costume and comes off as a very capable and strong individual that can beat anyone. I do feel that her line delivery though is hit or miss as they border on well acted to cringey. Chris Pine is perfect as a supporting character as he's charming and charismatic. And he's very capable even though he's fighting alongside Wonder Woman, who really doesn't need his help. The two characters paired have a good dynamic and Pine manages to hide some of Gadot's weaknesses, when they're on screen together. The rest of the cast is fine, but forgettable. They serve their purpose and move the plot forward.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Wonder Woman"" is a fun ride and the best DCCU movie we've gotten yet. It's really well directed, the actors and character are enjoyable, the action and visuals are stellar, and the score is fantastic. Yes there are problems here and there, but they don't take away from a competently made film. It gives me hope that D.C. is heading in the right direction and can make more good movies in the future that can finally give the fans what they deserve from these characters. I give it 4/5<br/><br/>Check Out More Reviews @ theconnoisseurreviews.tumblr.com"
"artbookguy","9","7","17","23 June 2017"," Wonder Woman Sets New Paradigm for Women In Film
","Let's start with what must not be overlooked.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" is the vision of Director Patty Jenkins who is the first woman to direct an action film with a budget that topped $100 million.<br/><br/>Jenkins, who did a superb job on this super film, is the real Wonder Woman here. She pulled it off BIG time.<br/><br/>As I sat in the theater and marveled at this film, I kept thinking that not only should parents rush their little girls out to see it, they should rush their boys out as well. Wonder Woman really sets a new paradigm for how women can and should be seen in film.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Now keep in mind that this is a man talking, but I loved the fact that Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is such a lovely mix of intelligence, power, strength, beauty, empathy, humor, vulnerability, righteousness, integrity and yes, love.<br/><br/>I dare say that I think we're still living during a time when many people confuse strength and meanness in women. Far too many men think ill of strong women and I think, ironically, a lot of women do too.<br/><br/>However, the fantastic news with ""Wonder Woman"" is that even in these cynical times, there isn't a trace of ""the B word"" to be found in this characterization. <br/><br/>Somehow, I've also equated meanness with fearfulness, but Woman Woman is SO confident and powerful that she need not be either.<br/><br/>Oh, and another thing. Wonder Woman is probably the least exploited, strong woman character that I've ever seen on film. In that sense, she's somewhat like Emma Peel from ""The Avengers"" television series, but on superhero steroids.<br/><br/>However, having said that, both women are totally hot. They just don't ""lead"" with their ""hotness."" <br/><br/>Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman has power that doesn't lie in her sexuality – although, believe me, she has that – but rather in her personal integrity, strength of character, superhero strength and intelligence. It's a winning combo that no strong man who's sure of himself wants to miss.<br/><br/>I'm glad I did not.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that a male director would've ""tarted up"" Wonder Woman. Doing so would give men some sense of control over this powerful and threatening female figure. However, that's not the case here.<br/><br/>Yes, Wonder Woman is a symbol, but Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot obviously worked hard to make her human and real and they've completely avoided compromising her power by making her an object. Mission accomplished.<br/><br/>If I weren't too long in the tooth, I'd get a Wonder Woman poster for my bedroom wall  However, if I did, I'm sure she'd be angry and would come bursting through the wall and beat me good for it.<br/><br/>In the next film, I'd love to see Wonder Wonder tackle Neanderthal Man.<br/><br/>No contest.

","WONDER WOMAN is magnificent.<br/><br/>It is a film about feminine power, the strength and beauty of spirit that comes from being a woman, the balance between good and evil in men, and finding your purpose in the world. I loved it!<br/><br/>DIANA, the main character, is born on an Island hidden from our world. An Island inhabited by a race of warrior women, called Amazons. She is a princess with a destiny guarded and hidden from her by a loving queen, her mother. The girl wishes to train to be a fierce warrior but when her mother forbids it, she is trained in secret, eventually reaching a level of excellence far beyond all the other Amazons on the Island, with her mothers reluctant consent. But in the world outside a war is being waged. A terrible war wherein tens of millions of people have already died. The news of this World War arrives via a soldier who accidentally breaks through the barrier cloaking the Island in mist, effectively hiding it from the world of warring men. The soldier is pursued by the enemy and as the Amazons fight the intruders, they sustain heavy losses, among them Diana's beloved teacher. On hearing about the millions of casualties in the world beyond the protective mists, Diana is filled with a sense of duty and purpose. She means to leave her beloved Island world and journey with the soldier into the world of men, in order to end this war and restore peace to it. Her mother is against it, but Diana's sense of duty impels her to disobey and escape with the soldier. She enters our world determined to end the slaughter.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot does a tremendous job playing Wonder Woman by not trying to masculinize the hero. You are always very aware that you are watching a woman being heroic. She is ultra feminine, pure of spirit and exquisitely beautiful. There is a fragility to Wonder Woman that, speaking as man, made me want to put my arm around her and protect her from all the bad in the world. But when she swings into action you KNOW that this woman does not need your protection. She is in total control of whatever situation. I feel that it is the womanly nurturing instinct in her, that drives Wonder Woman's quest for peace and justice. That's a unique perspective and motivation for a superhero. <br/><br/>However, unlike Superman, Wonder Woman has no problem killing men. She's not going to break down in tears of remorse after killing a bad guy. This woman is a soldier and she will deal out death to the deserving without a second thought. If you're on the side of wrong you will get what's coming to you via Wonder Woman's blade. Or her fists. Gal Gadot's fighting technique is superb, moving with grace and power no doubt because in real life she has been an Israeli combat instructor! <br/><br/>Do not make the mistake of thinking that this is a film for girls and women. It is much more than that. <br/><br/>WONDER WOMAN should be seen by both men and women. It is highly entertaining, thought provoking and action packed. In short, a masterpiece in the superhero genre. <br/><br/>SEE IT NOW!"
"obiegimmie","9","7","17","17 June 2017"," 'Wonder Woman' Review
","'Wonder Woman' is, in short, a masterpiece, an artful collaboration of romance, action, heart, and humor to create a near perfect superhero film. <br/><br/>First, some history; Wonder Woman was a DC character that first appeared around 1941. She was created by William Moulton Marston. WW prevailed through the several ages of comics, and by doing so created a significant following that fully encouraged this feminist revision. She has endured decades of television and movies, some good, others bad. They include:<br/><br/>1974 film starring Cathy Lee Crosby<br/><br/>1975-1979 TV series starring Lynda Carter<br/><br/>2009 direct to DVD animated film<br/><br/>2011 TV Pilot starring Adrianne Palicki<br/><br/>And of course numerous appearances in other DC films<br/><br/>In this retelling, Diana (Gal Gadot) is summoned from her euphoric island home to help American spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) during WW1. Their mission is to stop the deadly efforts of Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya) and Gen. Ludendorff (Danny Huston). But Diana, creation of the gods themselves, believes that humans are innately good and human corruption by evil god Ares is to blame. Trevor sets out to destroy Ludendorff's lethal poison gas and Diana joins him with the intent of killing Ares in his human incarnation. <br/><br/>I loved this film. I've seen it twice. I found myself genuinely caring when a specific character was in danger. I cannot tell you the last time I sat in a cinema and thought that. <br/><br/>In terms of flaws, 'WW' holds few. A few things that I did not enjoy was the casting choice for Ares. I know that the intent was obviously for surprise, but choosing an actor with that physique did not really fit earlier descriptions of Ares. I also thought that Dr. Poison and Ludendorff were a bit underdeveloped, but enjoyable. <br/><br/>The relationship between Trevor and Diana is striking. True, the romance is a bit rushed but I liked the equality and fairness to it. It seemed very honest and real as not just a romance, but as partners. <br/><br/>The most stunning thing about 'WW' is Diana. We see her as this innocent and naive girl who sees morality in only black and white. But after her exposure to humans, to war, Diana realizes that humans have the capability to be evil. It will ultimately come down to a choice each one of us will make that will determine our place in human history. <br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>90%<br/><br/>A"
"javi-y-se-acabo","9","7","17","13 June 2017"," Wonder Woman Wonderful Movie
","I liked Man of Steel and really liked Batman v Superman despite its critics and its faults, but I felt like Suicide Squad was a bit of let down and I started to think that the DC Universe really needed to start thinking quickly to do things better. And then, this movie appeared.<br/><br/>I think it's the best adaptation of this character that we could get on big screen and she truly deserved it. It tells the story of how Diana of Themyscira (Gal Gadot) decides to go with the pilot Steve Trevors (Chris Pine) to help on the world happening around the world. The story may be quite simple but it's told in a very entertaining way, that at any moment feels boring, maybe just a bit right before they get to the war. For me one of the biggest fails of the movie is the villain, that at the end felt like a bit rushed up and you can't clearly see what were his intentions and this, for some, may get the final act to a lower level.<br/><br/>The secondary characters don't appear that much and they don't to do many things because the real important part here is for the two main characters, Steve & Diana. Chris Pine did a very good job as the love interest of Diana, bringing some emotional moments and when he is with Gal Gadot they provide some very funny moments, specially near the beginning of the movie. And that's a good thing, to have some humour in it but just when needed. If you're in the middle of a Battlefield or fighting against the God of War you don't need to say any joke, but if you're in London discovering how the women were treated in that time maybe they really fit for show the surprise of Diana. And here the true star for me was Gal Gadot as the Amazon Princess of Themyscira. I think his appearance in Batman V Superman was very powerful and truly showed that he fitted the role perfectly, but in this movie, you also get to see that she can really act.<br/><br/>The visuals were as amazing as in the other DC Universe movies, with a very peculiar visual style that I hope they keep through all the movies because it's truly amazing. All the slow-mo moments are very powerful (for example the amazing No Man's Land scene or the part where she enters the Germans base full of anger or even the whole opening scene). To this you have to add the amazing score that Rupert Gregson-Williams created, using the theme that appeared in Batman V Superman and also creating many powerful, heroic and emotional themes.<br/><br/>A must see for all the DC fans, superhero fans, and specially Wonder Woman fans, I think they really created a very good movie for this character, that really deserved it."
"joshteggert","8","7","17","13 June 2017"," Enamouring in its powerful display of what a female superhero film can look like, a thoroughly enjoyable and surprisingly clever blockbuster.
","Putting aside the famous cape and cowl, the infamously grumpy Supes', and deterring from the unfittingly grim tone of the DC Extended Universe up to now, 'Wonder Woman' embodies a fresh start for the franchise, underpinned by subtle yet reverberating messages that are likely to inspire future instalments in several, encouraging mannerisms. Patty Jenkins has produced a truly gratifying entry into DCEU, defying all odds and breaking barriers which should now open the floodgates to more much needed positivity in the DCEU.<br/><br/>There was plentiful doubt amongst fans upon hearing the news that 'Wonder Woman' would be set during the First World War. But actually, this change in back drop, not only is it suitable in displaying the film's forceful morals, is a stimulating shift that allows Jenkins to explore the fundamentals of humanity without needing Bruce Wayne to have an existential crisis (a la 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'). The narrative follows Amazonian princess, Diana (Gal Gadot), and her journey with Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), a spy for British intelligence, as they venture into the front-line battlements of World War I, attempting to stop a potentially world threatening force. The 1918 setting allows for a clever guise in the Germans as a resonant opposing force, but as the story unfolds, the horrors of war sparks turmoil within Diana, who painfully begins to understand that she can't save everyone.<br/><br/>Gadot really puts on a magnificent show; perfectly cast as the Amazonian legend, she is now an icon in the industry, a new figurehead for the DCEU going forward. Supported by a fantastic array of individually absorbing characters, with a notably gripping performance from Chris Pine, 'Wonder Woman' is compellingly personal, contrasted with exhilarating action pieces which culminate to present a formidable overall conviction. Diana's initially naïve outlook on humanity adds superb depth to the narrative as she slowly yet reluctantly understands the barbaric nature of the world of man, and this allows it to be the first DC film to have such a convincing moral stance since 2008's 'The Dark Knight'.<br/><br/>It flows much like any other superhero film, and the origin story backdrop leaves a lot to be wished for in the opening third of the film particularly, but its packed with laughter, tears and kicks that make the build up to the unveiling of Wonder Woman in all her glory more than worth the wait (a scene which is wholeheartedly one of the best in the genre's history). Diana also has a much more interesting background, making this a story that is justifiably explored and, moreover, delightfully told.<br/><br/>A long time in the making, even longer in its legacy, 'Wonder Woman' is a modern pioneer for superhero movies. It demonstrates that, not only can a female hero be just as spellbinding, if not more so, than her male counterparts, but that DC is capable of making good films if it stops being so damn gloomy, and adds a dash of positivity in it place."
"mightymyke697","9","7","17","5 June 2017"," Wonder Woman was truly ""wonderful""
","So, me and the family went and saw Wonder Woman yesterday, and it was pretty damn great. Best movie DC has made since The Dark Knight (yes better than the Dark Knight Rises, and Batman Begins now that I think on it) The characters were extremely well done. I cannot give Gal Gadot enough praise for her performance as Diana/ Wonder Woman, giving ever moment of character development justice as well as showing a range of emotional acting skill while being a completely convincing bad-ass. Chris Pine as well did a fantastic job in his role, and shows off a good bit of range himself while he's at it.<br/><br/>It's tone is great (and varied), It's pacing was spot on. My worry was in it's action and I can happily say that it is as amazing and epic as you could hope for, and well edited and shot to boot! My only issue is to nitpick at the slow mo at times. It wasn't ever out of place, but it did feel a little overused. Thats a nitpick at best though. Characters, motivations, tone, theme, and action is all extremely well done.<br/><br/>Easily the best movie so far in the D.C.E.U. I'm fully excited for what they do with Wonder Woman next. Here's to a great movie and, hopefully, a turning point for D.C. Wonder Woman was truly wonderful (sue me) and I highly recommend it. My little sister, Marisa, will never see super heroes the same, and I'm glad for it."
"mockchef","9","7","17","4 June 2017"," It's a Wonder it Took This Long
","For one of the 1st $100 M budgeted, woman-directed, superhero movies, it was truly wonderful to experience. Let's hope the results of this opening weekend's box office(ending 6/4/17) starts to crack that glass ceiling in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Overall Wonder Woman does a great job of balancing seriousness, humor, and action. The cast plays off each other so well that you can forgive the few minor missteps in some side-story plot devices & in the 3rd act that are used the story.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast works so well together and scenes between Godot and each character are written so well and acted so realistically that you forgive those small missteps. <br/><br/>Godot is so good. So good at the physical, emotional, and naivete/fish out of water tightrope that she needed to walk to make this film work. You walk with Godot in every step throughout the film and through her she allows you to believe in her and in something greater. With everything, Diana's experiencing in this new world and everything happening currently in our world; you want to believe. <br/><br/>After watching this movie it is my belief Godot will be the hero for several generations inspiring young and old. If you weren't crushing on Chris Pine before. I promise you will now. Don't worry, we'll make room for you on the bandwagon. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is not a perfect film. It doesn't have to be. It's a great film. It's a damn fine film. It's the perfect film to launch an era. An era that should not have to exist. In 2017 can't the director list be 25/25/25/25 and have more shades than white?<br/><br/>Jenkin's ""WW"" is currently the best film the DCEU has to date. Godot has consistently been a bright light in this developing universe. Honorable mention for Affleck's portrayal of Wayne/Batman as being one of the best. Let's hope the bonfire that was lit this weekend provides enough illumination to the Powers-That-Be that says two things: <br/><br/>One - let directors - direct. Two - open up the field - men aren't the only gender that can direct."
"randy_orton_fan","Null","7","17","2 June 2017"," Great
","This movie was awesome.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot was a great choice to play Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>The movie had a lot of action and it treated you like an adult, not like other comic book movies (Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2, I'm looking at you). <br/><br/>Wonder Woman had complexity to her character, something you won't see in the MCU. She was naive about man's world, feeling that saving the world would be easy. She believed that if she stopped Ares that there'd be peace in the world, even though it turns out there are just bad people out there, something she comes to accept. But she is also shown there are good people, like Steve Trevor and his friends.<br/><br/>I've seen people say this movie copied the first Captain America movie because it was set in the past during a major war. But the difference is Warner Bros. and DC had the guts to actually show the enemy soldiers and acknowledged who and what they were, unlike Marvel Studios who didn't want to depict evil American Captain America beating up Nazis. For whatever reason Marvel thought it'd be offensive to show Captain America fighting Nazis, so he fought generic soldiers of Hydra.<br/><br/>Ares was awesome, trying to sway Diana to help him by showing her that he didn't influence man, they do all of these horrible things on his own. But Diana won't be swayed and she has an epic confrontation with Ares. It's always refreshing to see the hero actually fight the villain, not just generic henchman (looking at you MCU) or having the hero turn into Pacman for a gag (I just keep throwing shade at Marvel, don't I. Completely unintentional, I swear).<br/><br/>People keep saying this is the best DC movie yet. But here's the thing, Batman v Superman and Man of Steel were great films, if you ignore what Marvel fanboy critics say with their ""OMG, where are the jokes? Why is there so much action? Why is the story not easy to follow like the paint-by-number Marvel crap the MUC gives us?"" This movie shows me that everyone just hates Zack Snyder for whatever reason. Patty Jenkins directed this movie, but the story was credited to Snyder and he and his wife produced it like the rest of the DCeU movies he directed. <br/><br/>But this movie didn't feel much different than the other DCeU movies to me. Had a serious tone with intense situations, and a hero having to stand against overwhelming odds.<br/><br/>People say ""this is the only DC movie with any heart."" But we all know what they mean. they just mean there was some humor in this movie. Critics and fanboys believe that for a movie to have ""heart"", you have to have gotten a few chuckles out of a movie. But that's nonsense. <br/><br/>The DCeU is underrated, and critics and fanboys have chosen the already tired MCU movie style of 1-dimensional plots, phoned in performances, quips, quips, quips, quips, quips, and quips with 1- dimensional villains to compare all comic book movies to. So if a movie doesn't fit what the critics and fanboys expect it to, if it's even remotely dark or lacks a certain number of jokes, it's considered bad.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to Justice League, and I left the theater happy after seeing Wonder Woman. It's nice to have movies to look forward to, because frankly I don't feel like watching Iron-Man 3.5: Homecoming or Thor: Jokes and Gags.<br/><br/>See this movie if you haven't already, and go back and watch the previous movies of the DCeU with fresh eyes and not judging it based on what Kevin Feige tells you a comic book movie is supposed to be.<br/><br/>Every movie doesn't have to be a sitcom."

","I think we can all agree that Gal Gadot's portrayal of Wonder Woman was the best part of ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"", so this stand alone movie was no surprise to anyone who saw it coming. And because she shined so bright in the dreary and grim ""Dawn of Justice"", the expectations were lofty for this to be the film to save the critically-panned DC Expanded Universe franchise. Mine will not be the first review to say that this is the DC movie that we have all been waiting for. Well written and gracefully directed, this action- packed epic finally delivers a DC comics superhero movie that is worthy of our attention. There were only two things that disappointed me when the credits began to roll. One was that some of the CGI in the action scenes (specifically at the beginning with the Amazons) didn't seem finished. There were certain shots that didn't come off as ""clean"" as they could have. (I'm really knit-picking here, but it did bother me some). Second was the the final battle with the supernatural baddie (no spoilers here). It just felt way too over-the-top compared to the rest of the movie. I didn't hate it, it just seemed unnecessary. But, all in all, this is still the crown jewel of the DCEU movies (so far) and is worthy of all of the critical praise it continues to receive. All hail Princess Diana aka Wonder Woman and her first blockbuster feature film. ...and one more thing. We couldn't get one...not even ONE extra scene during or after the credits!?! Even ""Suicide Squad"" got a Bruce Wayne cameo!! I'm just saying."

Chris Pine does an excellent job, but every other scene hurts the soul. The story is simply uninteresting. You never care about any of the characters. Their caricature of WWII is pathetic. Every story element, turn is a comic book loosely based on reality scene, which would be fine IF the film was more like a comic book movie, but it's not. It's played entirely literal.

The acting is good and Gal Gadot is fantastic. It's just a boring story that's so overdone recently with the countless other superhero movies.

The super trained and strong Amazon risks to be killed because of distraction making killed her trainee so easily that the viewer could ask itself how she can be so strong against the super villain. By the way, bad acting. Germans talk English and the military team which infiltrate the enemy camp is ridiculous to be acceptable. A trick to make funny a movie."

But if your intention is to empower women and the best thing about the film is the romance between steve and Diana, you went wrong somewhere.

","Outstanding. Wonder Woman delivers in one of the most heart felt superhero movies ever. Great story telling starting Wonder Woman's journey as a child watching and learning from her fellow Amazonians on the beautiful Paradise Island to blossoming into the Amazonian warrior that makes her wonderful. There were many moments that pulled your heart strings in a way unlike any other superhero movie. Great action scenes accompany the movie but the emotional connection between the characters is what carries this film.

But: Diana (wonder woman) later explains that ""men are essential for procreation but when it comes to pleasure, unnecessary"". so they actually know about the human world around them?<br/><br/>if they were created by Zeus to fight Ares, why bother putting the Amazon island into the human realm and not even letting them notice the human realm? why not put them in the realm of gods or is Ares (he is still at large) hiding in the human world? Well, then why not chase him proactively in the human world? <br/><br/>Never before an Amazon cared about the human world but suddenly Diana wants to stop world war 1. Why not stop the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) with casualties estimated between 3,000,000–11,500,000...or any other war for that matter? <br/><br/>Pine repeatedly sees fit to call the shots and boss her about, despite the fact that she's clearly his physical and intellectual superior.<br/><br/>At one point, a female secretary explains all the work that she does for her male boss prompting Wonder Woman to quip, 'Where I'm from, that's called slavery.' The cinema audience broke into a knowing chuckle...<br/><br/>No fight - besides the fight against Ares (and that one is actually also ridiculously boring and short) - is even slightly interesting because every opponent is worse than cannon fodder compared to her powers.<br/><br/>When Gadot (wonder Woman) is called upon to communicate the horrors of war moments later after having broken through German front lines like a wrecking ball, with slow motion action to capture every inch of ""cool"" action...it feels more than silly listening to her doing that.<br/><br/>over-earnestness often resulting in silliness <br/><br/>bludgeoning special effects <br/><br/>and a messy, often wildly implausible plot"

How can we even picture world war I in such an uneducated and stereotyped way? How come Germans all speak English with a German accent? How come we can predict everything that will happen before they take place?<br/><br/>Anyone who is telling me this movie is ""feminist"" because it has a ""strong female character"" is mistaken! If this movie really wanted to do justice to women: <br/><br/>1º - Wonderwoman would be more than a piece of meat in a sexy armor. 2º - She would have realistic qualities (something else than a supernatural force: because, let's face it, her only 2 qualities are that she is beautiful and unrealistically strong.) 3º - There would be other female characters who are not pictured as either stupid or mean 4º - Wonderwoman is not even intelligent and does not even reflect on the situation: they told her that ""war was bad so you have to end war"" and so that's all she can say ""war is so bad and terrible, I have to end it with my superpowers"".<br/><br/>This is the kind of production that thinks their audience is too dumb: everything has to be explained and the music tells the viewer how to feel about each situation (very ""evil music"" for the very mean characters, goofy music for the supposedly funny moments, heroic music for the ""superwoman is so strong moments"", cheesy sad music when we are supposed to feel sad,...).<br/><br/>Please don't watch this movie, this might burn some of your neurons."
"danaber","9","6","14","15 October 2017"," Fun movie that I can watch again and again
","So I see a lot of ""awful"" reviews here, but to me that is one the best movies I've seen - not just in that genre. Honestly, I'm not a super- hero fan, I think I saw maybe 2 movies (Michael Kitton's Batman and Christopher Reeve's Superman), and watched BvS for Gal Gadot, but the movie itself was pretty bad (I'm being nice).<br/><br/>But Wonder Woman? I love it. OK, so Gal Gadot won't win an Oscar (for this one or maybe ever) but she is perfect for Wonder Woman. When you see her on interviews you get why they chose her. I saw her doing some Israeli shows in the past, when she started doing movies in Hollywood I had my doubts (cause she wasn't very good in Bubot, for example) but she's a much better actress today, and she's still developing. Luckily for her (and for everyone involved) there's a strong cast to support her - Chris Pine above everyone else, of course.<br/><br/>Chris Pine proves himself to be an excellent actor, and honestly - I never paid any attention to him. After Wonder Woman I watched pretty much all his movies (and one TV show he was on) just for him. He's one the most talented actors our there today. He can be super funny (Horrible bosses), his Captain Kirk is perfect, his dramatic roles were touching, and even as a psycho he gets it done better then anyone. Wonderful actor.<br/><br/>OK, the important part? The movie itself. I think I watched it 10 times by now, and every time I find more stuff that I missed, that just make it even better for me. The chemistry between Gal and Chris is amazing, and every character is just perfect. They manage to show you different stereotypes and get you to think of them in the simple stereotype (Charlie, Samir, Chief) and then they prove to you that they're not what you think they are. Charlie is actually dealing with PTSD, Samir is a good liar because he's a frustrated actor in the wrong color, and even if you think people see Diana as beautiful and nothing more - that's exactly what the movie is about. She's beautiful, but she's just so much more. When Samie and Charli meet her they laugh at the thought of taking her to the front, but as the movie goes on they learn she can take care of herself, but it's Steve that might need help.<br/><br/>It just feels like there's a lot of thought in every word they say, every thing they do and every scene. From Steve seeing Antiope jumping on the shield (and using it with Diana in Veld), to the Queen telling Diana she will do nothing (while Steve's dad told him you can either do nothing or you can do something, and he already tried nothing). Everything has a meaning.<br/><br/>So no, it's not Oscar materials, I gave it a 9 because the final battle is a huge disappointment, but it's fun, smart and exciting movie. The fighting scenes rock (the one in the warehouse/Weld... wow), and they actually manage to build all stories perfectly.<br/><br/>Even with Steve and Diana, they actually build a real love story in a short time. Them saving each other again and again (yeah, he saved her in Veld), always keeping eye contact between them (including when she's in no-man's land, during the fight scene in Veld etc), they just manage to give the characters more depth then one can imagine. So if you didn't see it (or if you saw it and expect Oscar material movie) just expect a fun movie that has some romance, some action and some laughs.<br/><br/>One of my all time favorites."

","I don't get how this movie got such a high IMDb score. My husband and I rented it and had to fast forward through a lot of it just to make it through the end. Gal Gadot's character was likable, but she really is not a great actress. This is supposedly some ground- breaking movie bc there is a strong, female super hero, and I think that has warped a lot of these reviews. High reviews because it is a girl power movie while disregarding the fact that the movie itself sucked."

","Recently seeing what appears to be Hugh Jackman's last Wolverine films,I felt like opening the pages of another Comic-Book adaptation. Finding Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad to be disappointing, I was surprised to hear some very positive comments from a friend about the latest DC film,which led to me finding out how wonderful Wonder Woman is. The plot:<br/><br/>Born out of clay by her mum (!)Diana Prince grows up on the island of Themyscira,and is trained in combat by Amazonian warriors. Looking out to the ocean one day,Prince sees a plane crash. Swimming out,Prince gets American pilot Captain Steve Trevor to safety,as a German cruiser invades the island. Losing some of her fellow Amazonian's whilst fight the Germans,Prince gets Trevor to reveal that a horrific event called ""The Great War"" is taking place. Believing evil god Ares to be causing it,Prince leaves the island to kill Ares and end the war,but soon discovers that Ares is not the only evil in war.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Directing her first feature film since 2003, Patty Jenkins returns in blazing form,with the dishwater dull darkness of the DC world being wiped by Jenkins and cinematographer Matthew Jensen for eye- catching Steampunk creations,as the WWI setting allows rickety planes and quirky steam/gas powered weapons to be thrown across the screen. Retaining the slo-mo DC trademark,Jenkins gives the fight scenes an exciting crunch,via well-held wide shots allowing each fight move to be clearly seen,and the final ""goodie V baddie"" battle having enough use of weapons to give it a real thump.<br/><br/>Wisely trimming it of almost all franchise links,the screenplay by Allan Heinberg/Jason Fuchs and Zack Snyder frees itself for a breezy fish out of water tale,with a much needed inclusion of comedy into the DC world actually giving Prince and Trevor's romance some warmth. Following the Steampunk design,the writers let Wonder Woman soar in an exciting alt history adventure,which delivers a message that highlights the horrific number of deaths from ""The Great War."" <br/><br/>Off the Enterprise, Chris Pine gives a dashing performance as Trevor,with Pine playing the comedy moments with relish,as David Thewlis gives a cackling boo-hiss turn as Ares. Knocking out all who stand in her way, Gal Gadot (who did stunts while pregnant) gives an excellent performance as Prince,who is given a ""classic"" which is joined by an extremely charismatic fighting style,as Gadot shows Prince to truly be a wonder woman."

","Spoiler Alert! It is July 5, 2017. Although I can't imagine that anyone who has wanted to see this film hasn't already.<br/><br/>No movie is perfect but Wonder Woman 2017 comes very close. <br/><br/>Visually it is stunning; costumes and scenery. The music is amazing. Wonder Woman's theme is pure adrenaline rush and used sparingly, which makes it more satisfying when it plays. The fight sequence with the Amazon women on the beach was breathtaking to watch; graceful, forceful, and artistic. It was so exciting to see them riding their horses in defense of Diana. The slow motion sequences were a great touch.<br/><br/>There was human comedy, laughter, anguish, pain and rage and it was all done realistically; nothing forced.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this was a love story; non-traditional but love it was. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine exuded delicious chemistry; their dialogue was of two beings from two different worlds learning about each other. It was genuine and respectful and touching. Their banter was hilarious at times. They were both morally strong beings who cared about others. They tried to understand each other's perspectives but followed their own sense of doing what was right.<br/><br/>There were many favorite moments for me but there were two that really stood out. The first was in the battle with the Germans when she turned and yelled ""Steve, let's go."" The second was in the town when he called to her ""Diana; shield."" They counted on each other. I loved that Steve accepted that she was stronger than he was without feeling threatened. He was, after all, brave in his own very human way. Chris was vulnerable, warm, and charming. I think this was his most appealing role.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman in her statuesque figure and personality. She was so refreshing; she too was vulnerable, innocent at times but determined to fulfill her role as an Amazon, not realizing that she was in fact a god. She was kind and loving to all the humans she met through Steve. She was amazing in battle; loved her twisting around sweeping her foes off their feet. <br/><br/>In the end when she went from grief to rage I felt it all. I did see the movie 8 times and this scene was one of the reasons why.<br/><br/>Steve was so genuine and touching in his final scene with Diana. The gentle way he said ""I wish we had more time"" and ""I love you"" was emotionally heartbreaking and satisfying. <br/><br/>Now for the hard part; the sequel Wonder Woman movie. I want to see Gal Gadot again in her own movie; I am not partial to the testosterone filled movies she appears in with the super heroes who are so filled with anger and antagonism even with each other. <br/><br/>I, of course, would love for there to be a way Chris Pine could come back as perhaps a son or grandson of Steve Trevor (with the same name). But here's the problem. He would not be the same person with the same background and experiences as the original Steve. And Wonder Woman would have matured as she has now lived among men for years. She would have outgrown him. I would not want to ruin the love story they shared in this film by trying to force a 2nd story. He touched her by being human, not perfect, but loving and hopeful that she would save mankind as he gave up his own life so humans could continue to survive.<br/><br/>As a feminist from the 1960s this movie appealed to me on many levels. Most of all the message was about the choice to love or hate. She made the right choice. May she live long and prosper. Maybe she'll meet up with Captain Kirk; after all she is immortal and there are many worlds to explore."

","I've never been a comic book person. I love comic book movies though. Both the DC and Marvell series have been really good. Logan was a good movie, but not as good as I had hoped. I haven't seen Ghost in a Shell Yet or Atomic Blonde, so I would put Wonder Woman as the best comic book type action movie of the year.<br/><br/>It's by no means a chick flick. I think it's a movie girls would like, but it's definitely a male fantasy. I don't know why some reviewers are saying the rating is downgraded by men who don't like the idea of a female superhero. Any man would be honored to get their *** kicked by Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot is gorgeous. She plays the part of a naive girl who after growing up on a paradise island, gets to see what the rest of the world is like. She plays it well. There is a lot of action in this movie. It's based during WW1, and it's actually pretty dark at times (the atmosphere). The action scenes are excellent. They aren't pointless. The movie builds up to the action sequences. It was a really good movie.<br/><br/>There are a few things I would change about it though. First off, I would throw an R rating on it, add more violence and less clothing on Amazonia."

","Wonder Woman was always going to stand out. In a huge burst of superhero fervor that's lasted for decades it's the first time since Elecktra that a superheroine has had her own movie and it's the first time since Punisher: War Zone that a woman has directed a superhero movie. Combine that with the fact that it's the first superhero movie starring a woman to be directed by a woman AND the fact that despite being an iconic and beloved superheroine it's the first time that a live-action Wonder Woman has made it to the big screen you have a movie burdened down under the weight of some heavy firsts. <br/><br/>The good news is that even among so many game changing stats Wonder Woman holds it own simply as a movie. I love action movies but I don't go to too many. Simple fact being that between the cheesy, often lazy dialogue, the blurred action scenes that go by way too quickly to even understand what's going on and the terrible to non- existent characterization, it's often not worth the price of the ticket. But Wonder Woman has a great script and is lovingly directed by Patty Jenkins. This may only be her second feature film but Jenkins has spent the time between this and her 2003 debut film Monster handling big budget TV pilots and cutting her teeth behind the scenes on small studio shorts to test whether she was superhero director material. Is she ever! <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a introduction to WW the character and, aside from two clumsy bookends, pretty manages to stand on its own as a movie. It tells the tale about how Diana, princess of Themyscira, grows up on an all female matriarchy. Sheltered by her mother, the adventurous Diana defies her orders and trains as a warrior under the guidance of her aunt. Her peaceful existence grinds to a halt one day when Steve Trevor crashlands in the waters of the island. After she rescues him and ascertains he's a man, the island is attacked by WWI German soldiers who bring with them guns, which the Amazons have never seen before. Horrified by the consequences of this weapon Diana decides to go with Steve to do what she was trained to do and stop the war, reclaiming peace and love for mankind. <br/><br/>That's the gist of the plot, which doesn't sound that great when I put it down in writing. Trust me when I say that the world building and characterization really amp up the value of this simple story. I had my doubts about Gal Gadot, who plays our titular Wonder Woman, but she truly steps up to the plate and inhabits the role with oodles of charm and grit. This is a Diana who is naive but not stupid, kind hearted but determined, who is willing to go the extra mile and do the right thing because that's what she believes in. The other characters are really wonderful and charming too. Chris Pine is given a lot to do as Steve Trevor but he is a good and ultimately supporting player to Diana. Lucy Davis kills in a tiny role as Etta Candy, Steve's secretary. Out of all the Amazons Robin Wright really sticks out as a fierce warrior who is clearly having the time of her life in a really epic battle scene that I wish had gone on even longer! Trevor's crew of misfits, despite being given little screen time also have their own unique traits and values and Jenkins, the actors, and the screenwriters succeed in making you care for them over their short amount of screen time. <br/><br/>Ultimately while this film is about two and a half hours long the time just flies by. It's elegantly paced, and if anything could have done with an extra half hour to fully flesh out the end. I gave it an 8 as a rating, rounded up from what would be a 7.5 if IMDb allowed half stars. Why not higher when I'm full of praise? Ultimately though the film is charming there are some bones to pick here and there with the film. Nothing that detracts from it being an overall great experience, but not enough to boost it to a higher score. And ultimately, as fun and as charming as the film is, it doesn't really do anything to reinvent the wheel. It is a simple story beautifully told. It's just a pity that more action films aren't able to meet the bar of being decent. <br/><br/>Definitely give this one a watch. You won't be disappointed."

","""Wonder Woman"" is a superhero movie that fulfills the heroic and mythic demands of that genre and also embraces issues of female power and the need to turn from hate to love, war to peace. It is a movie with a good romantic rapport by Gadot and Pine, a solid secondary cast and a dramatic idea contained in Allan Heinberg's script. Patty Jenkins rises above the pressure and brings a solid, interesting and humorous story to life. As Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot is perfect and ideal for this role. The only bad thing in this movie is that there are too many villains, none of them dramatically strong enough to be much of a threat, and the most interesting characters get killed off too soon. But in short, Wonder Woman is a wonder."

","This is my first review because i usually don't bother to write reviews but when it comes in DC i must ! The movie is a very good effort and shows that DC can learn from the comments. Wonder woman has a few problems but they don't destroy the bigger picture. First gal gadot gave everything but she has a specific way of acting that cannot give a MEMORABLE performance.Another thing that bothers me is the SLOW MOTION. I mean whaaat? In the first fights is good but director uses it all the time. It is unnecessary and destroys the flow of the action. I loved that the humour scenes were exactly where they should be and the chemistry of the protagonists was obvious. Moreover i liked the plot twist, but i wanted in the end Ares being transformed into a more frightening creature like the animation, because this actor is not a villain AT ALL.Dr poison on the other side had small role.Please upcoming DC movies make the most battles in LIGHT in order to see the action.Again i have to say that the action was better than MoS but sometimes it appears to me a ton of cgi, specially when ww does fast moves.

Wonder Women has always been one of the most iconic hero in the history of film based on famous comics. There was skeptics criticizing the casting of new comer Gal Gadot, but I thought she had the opportunity of a lifetime for a young actress. She not only did well, but I think her performance rivals heath ledger( not better, but she was great) for best I've seen in a DC film ever.<br/><br/>For comic fans familiar with the origin story of wonder woman will be satisfied with the slight updates to the plot. Chris Pine lands on Themyscira as a spy to warn the amazons of WW2, Diana in fear that Ares has corrupted mankind and she must stop him to stop war of man. Just slight details of the main plot that are told masterfully and the film looks great from visual perspective. Wonder Women was the birth of Gal Gadot the Super Star and Rise of the REAL DCEU."
"msurocks","8","6","14","12 June 2017"," The DC movie that I'VE been waiting for
","With DC's failed attempts to get me invested in their two biggest powerhouses (Batman and Superman) along with getting me to love the soundtrack more then their shot at a villains story (Suicide Squad)and even now I've found myself losing interest more and more for Justice League I truly believed that Wonder Woman would be the one film in its roster that would at least restore my faith in them or at least show the rest of the directors for future movies how to properly succeed in the franchise. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a compelling story that has inspired hope and a real sense of comradely and conflict that DC in the past has failed to establish in the past. There was conflict in Batman V Superman, but i didn't feel it. There was conflict in Suicide Squad, but in reality these characters don't care(I mean there sitting at a bar having drinks and then suddenly they're like ""Well we gotta go give everyone fan service."") <br/><br/>And That's what DC feels like. It feels like the directors are only giving the audience what they want because of fan service.<br/><br/>Which in some cases isn't wrong. But things like Doomsday in BVS The Flash cameo in Suicide squad And then the really force intro to the Justice Leagues Profiles in BVS It's like DC is trying to scream at the top of it's lung in Neon lights<br/><br/>WE'RE A CONNECTED UNIVERSE JUST LIKE MARVEL, CHECK OUT OUR FAN SERVICE IT'S NOT NEEDED BUT WE DO IT ANYWAY!!<br/><br/>It isn't trying to be an emotional journey that speaks to the audience and can also be a good time. I'm not saying be more like Marvel, I'm saying at least get us to CARE about our leads and their conflicts and you have to do that by showing that THEY care.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is different because you see so much emotion. You see so much love, compassion, trust, loyalty, hope, fear, desperation and you truly feel the loss, you feel the rage and conflict. I loved being on Paradise Island and seeing the Amazons fight along side one another, I really felt a strong sisterhood on how they would defend and speak to one another. Wonder Woman is a story just trying to be it's own intro to the DC expanded universe. It has its flaws and a kinda disappointing villain but was enjoyable because i felt a real connection to this character. <br/><br/>Along with that Wonder Woman wast trying to be a feminist film. (funny how no one thought that about this movie but with Ghostbusters it was given all kinds of hate) It wasn't trying to show how Men are stronger or how they're all corrupt, no it shows how mankind/the human race no matter who you are cannot always be the best that we should set out to be. At one point they even bring up race, which I wasn't expecting, it deals with all these issues that can lead people to think certain ways. Even though there was a clear villain to this movie, i feel like just the ideas of the Human race and what that can lead to was villainous all on its own.<br/><br/>Maybe I felt this way because she was new to her role of being a heroine and you see her make mistakes, you see her question herself and how things work, you see her fight, show courage, fear and lose a sense of hope in those she's suppose to protect which isn't something we see a lot in superhero movies, you don't see the heroes question if the public is even worth the time of day, but even then the right decision is made based on what SHE thinks and not what the influence of others should lead her to do. <br/><br/>Over all i feel that Wonder Woman was a very enjoyable experience and was pleased to have seen it with my mother ( a huge WW fan growing up in the 70's)<br/><br/>Wonder Woman leaves you with a real sense of hope, love and faith and I would highly recommend it!! 8/10"
"LaurieMann","8","6","14","5 June 2017"," The Wonder of Wonder Woman
","Months ago, I had very mixed feelings about going to see the Wonder Woman movie. I was never a big Wonder Woman fan in the first place. I'd read the comics sometimes in the '60s, watched the amusing Lynda Carter show in the '70s but was never really into it. I was really sick to death of the current Marvel and DC comic movies - the Marvel movies were no longer very funny and the last good DC-related movie was probably Batman back in the late '80s. I figured I'd give WW a pass.<br/><br/>And then I started seeing the trailer for the new Wonder Woman movie. It was an impressive two minutes. Interesting photography, athletic leaping about, some humor...maybe this would be good. I'd always hated the slow motion in movies like The Matrix but the use of slow-mo in the trailer made sense for Wonder Woman. <br/><br/>So I went on the first day. I went on about one hour of sleep, so during the first hour of the movie, i dozed off periodically and missed a few points. The theater wasn't terribly full for a 12:30 show, but it had more than the 10-20 you often see during the first show on a Friday. I did manage to stay awake through most of the second half and really enjoyed most of it. The scene where Wonder Woman rose out of the trenches and ran across the battlefield was extremely moving on many levels.<br/><br/>There were at least two backward-nods to ""Great Famous Feminist Moments in Movies and/or Books. The scene I mentioned featuring WW racing across ""No Man's Land"" just screamed the famous moment from Return of the King where Eowyn rips off her helmet, screams ""I am no man!"" and kills the Witch King (with help from another ""non-man,"" Merry). The other moment was a little quieter and I missed it during it first time I saw the movie (I liked it so much I went again on Saturday with my family) as I was sleeping. There's that amusing scene when Diana and Steve talk on the boat, and she explains that she understands about pleasure seemed like a shout out to Teri Garr's famous comment in Tootsie ""I'm responsible for my own orgasm.""<br/><br/>The action scenes were all well-shot, and there was always enough character development and dialog to keep the movie interesting. Strong photography, effects, costumes, production development, acting, script - this is probably the best action movie I've ever seen. I ranked it an 8 on IMDb. Congratulations to Patty Jenkins, Gal Gadot & the rest of the crew - you did a GREAT job!!<br/><br/>MY ONE SPOILERY BIG QUIBBLE WITH THE MOVIE<br/><br/>I had such hope that maybe, just maybe, the 20 minutes of bloated fighting at the end of every action movie would not happen in Wonder Woman. When Diana killed the German general, I nearly stood up and cheered. But then she realized that even though she thought she'd killed Ares, the war was going on...because the war-mongering general was not Ares, but someone more behind-the-scenes was...which, after a few minutes of interesting discussion about how Ares worked, launched into about a 15 minute-long boated fight scene. Oh well, at least it seemed a little shorter than usual."

"fredschaefer-406-623204","8","6","14","3 June 2017"," DC has a winner at last.
","Most fans agree that SUPERMANvBATMAN was a disappointment at best, but one of the best things about it was Gal Gadot's Amazon Princess. So good was Gadot, that I actually started looking forward to Diana Prince's solo film, something I would have done a few years ago. And I can say with all confidence that director Patty Jenkins and screenwriter Allan Heinberg have kept a good thing gong, for their big screen WONDER WOMAN is the best DCMU film since Christopher Nolan finished his DARK KNIGT trilogy. It has lots of heart and sincerity, with real character development in a script blessedly free of angst and cynicism.<br/><br/>It helps that the character of Wonder Woman is not saddled with an origin story that is so set in stone that any attempt to tweak it for modern audiences will immediately risk enraging and alienating die-hard fans. Thankfully we do not have to sit through Krypton exploding yet again, not to mention Uncle Ben getting shot or Thomas and Martha Wayne being gunned down in an alley. There is a lot of exposition in the first 20 minutes or so, as we learn about Princess Diana and the all female society that exists on the hidden island paradise she grows up on. The action quickly kicks into gear when World War I pilot and spy, Steve Trevor, crashes his plane on the island and is rescued from drowning by Diana, just in time to battle his German pursuers to the death. From Steve, she learns about the outside world and the conflict that threatens to consume the globe and before we know it, the two are bound for Europe, where the Amazon Princess plans to confront and kill, Aires, the Greek God of War, the villain of the piece, who is lurking behind the scenes and fanning the flames of battle.<br/><br/>The second act of the film is equal parts fish out of water story as Diana tries to fit into early 20th Century Great Britain, desperate mission film as Diana, Steve and a rag tag group of ethnically diverse soldiers and spies journey behind German lines to destroy the super weapons factory of General Ludendorff (whom Diana believes is Aires), and war movie, as Diana and company go into trenches and charge across No Man's Land under heavy fire. The third act is all confrontations and aftermath, as Diana has a showdown with Aires and Steve is forced to make a major sacrifice. This last act is when the movie becomes a very conventional super hero film as the heroes confront the Big Bad and Diana gets the worst of it until she realizes an obvious and self evident truth and then easily vanquishes the villain. It's a comic book trope for sure, but the movie has been so good up to this point, it can be forgiven. There is also a twist in the final act that won't come as much of a surprise in that it involves a character who would serve no purpose unless he was clearly not who he appeared to be. At least we do not get a climax with one to those portals to another world opening up in the sky like in SUICIDE SQUAD and THE AVENGERS. Bonus points for that. <br/><br/>There is plenty of CGI, but it does not overwhelm, the action scenes are well done, but they don't come at the expense of character development. But the charge across No Man's Land and the battle for the French village is awesome. They do get WW's weapons right, including her indestructible bracelets, shield and of course, the lasso of truth.<br/><br/>WONDER WOMAN moves along a fast pace, the dialog does not make you groan (no ""save Martha"" in this one) and is largely absent from the clunky storytelling that marred a number of DC films. Some of WW canon is changed in that a major character dies, but it is not nearly as outrageous as MAN OF STEEL, which drove a lot of Superman fans up the wall and across the ceiling. The World War I setting helps a lot, as it avoids some of the awkwardness of trying meld mid 20th Century super heroes into 21st Century culture. Although I don't think the term ""psychopath"" was in common use in 1918. I must say that WONDER WOMAN is about as historically accurate as INGLOUROUS BASTERDS.<br/><br/>The cast is first rate, starting with Gal Godat, who is the perfect Wonder Woman for our times (nothing against Lynda Carter); she is both sexy and intelligent, with more than enough screen presence to carry a dozen films. Chris Pine has what could have been a thankless role as the make love interest, but he brings the same charisma to the part of Steve Trevor as he did to James T. Kirk, making Steve a perfect match for Diana. Danny Huston brings some of his American HORROR STORY villainy to the part of Ludendorff, a real personage from history. Other roles are well filled by David Thewlis, Connie Neilsen (as Diana's mother Hippolyta), Robin Wright, Ewen Bremmer, Said Thaghmaui, Eugene Brave Rock, and Elena Anaya. <br/><br/>WONDER WOMAN gives me hope that DCMU ship has righted itself and I'm now looking forward to JUSTICE LEAGUE, though I was a little disappointed that we did not at least get an appearance of Ben Affleck's Batman or any of her other JLA cohorts. Now if they could just green light a TEEN TITANS movie based on George Perez's great 80's run on that comic. I'd look forward to that."
"StaneSKT","7","6","14","3 June 2017"," Nothing Wondering
","First of all the super high ratings everywhere about this movie are just a joke. There is absolutely nothing really special in it, and yeah I'm serious.<br/><br/>The story is...flat. Basically without the plane crash at the beginning, there never will be a Wonder Woman movie and consequently her presence in Justice League. The drama was fake, the whole movie was slow and full of nonsense and I'm not talking just about the dialogs, and stupid jokes, also some of the action scenes. In every single shot she can do something new, which looks dumb. At the end guy named Steve, played by a guy named Chris, sacrificed himself, to save a city, by flying a plane to his own doom...for sure sounds like other movie released in 2011. <br/><br/>The CGI, damn the CGI looks awful. I guess there is no action scene in the whole movie, where the special effect looks cool. Everything is so unreal. There is a full CGI Wonder Woman Scene, probably not just one. The slow motion action scenes, I mean which year is it, can I watch the same scene, with normal speed?<br/><br/>Every time DC fans talk about MARVEL lame villains, well there were 3 in this movie and every one of them was worse and worse. Doctor Poison got 5 lines and the same ""gas leak"" scene...literally. The forgettable general,what was his name....Ludendorff. Well bad version of Red Skull, and yeah there was no explanation how his powers works, but who cares. Finally the big bad, (which identity was already spoiled by the DC ""creative"" team) which was also mentioned in the beginning of the movie...Ares. You see, this is name that everyone know, no matter how much you know about MARVEL or DC. This is the God of War. Well not really in this movie. More like better Doomsday...except the head. How the f*ck you make Ares and under the helmet you see the same mustache guy. I mean come on, no red eyes, no dark face, just the same mustache guy that got about 5 lines in the whole movie and one final monologue in the end! The relevation of Ares and the way he was defeated was dumb, really not kidding it was DUMB! <br/><br/>Bruce Wayne is mentioned in this movie of course! Because how can you make a movie without Batman? I mean really I'm getting tired of watching Batman in every DC movie.<br/><br/>Probably the best things about this movie were the Turkish guy Sameer, just because he was the only funny thing in this movie, alongside with the Scottish guy in some scenes and the final sacrifice moment by Steve Trevor.<br/><br/>And after this review you'll say that I'm hater. No, I'm not, when I got into the theatre I was ready to watch a good DC movie, but at some points I was close to fall asleep. And still I giving this...thing 7/10, but in real it must be around 6."
"bigmadams","8","6","14","2 June 2017"," The DCEU is back on track!
","A lot has been said about the DCEU in the last three years, most of it not very positive. Some of the criticism has been justified (BatmanVSuperman was pure hot garbage) and a lot of it was completely unjustified (Suicide Squad has its gaping flaws, but I will fight to the death anyone who says it deserves the drubbing it got from film critics). But I think critics and fans are finally on the same page with Wonder Women. The claims of it saving the DCEU is a little much, but the claims of it being the best DCEU film as absolutely true! They tell Diana Price/Wonder Woman's origin story in a way that I can't see anyone not loving it.<br/><br/>When you go to see this film, you will be pleasantly surprised by the themes explored. Yeah, there is a TON of girl power on display, but it never once feels like a lecture of how great women are and how awful men are! In fact, the main theme isn't that Women can save the world, but rather love can save the world! Other themes in the film that are explored are the duality of mankind, the horrors of war and why humanity feels the need to wage war.<br/><br/>The plot is also a lot more detailed than most comic book movies, which is something that is probably long overdue as well. I don't wish to give too much away, but needless to say, they had managed to find a good balance between story, dialogue, and action. The Director Patty Jenkins deserves a lot of praise for deciding not to try and re-write the comic book movie formula, but instead try to adapt it to suit the kind of story she wanted to tell!<br/><br/>The casting of this film was just about spot on! Chris Pine is perfect as U.S. Air Force Pilot and Spy Steve Trever who is not made to look compliantly defenseless compared to Gal Gadot's Wonder Women. He's a badass with a heart of pure gold in this adaptation. The supporting cast is brilliant from the Amazons to the Germans. I won't name those cast in those roles because I want you guys to be surprised and thrilled as I was when I watched in the cinema. However, If I am being honest Gal Gadot is not a strong actor. She's a little rigid, and I think her looks played a part in her being cast in the role of Diana Price/Wonder Woman as not nice as that may sound! But the material and the other actors she's working with are so good that she can manage to bring just enough to the role to make it work. Although too much of the film's comic relief and drama comes from the characters naivety and utter lack of knowledge of the outside world! After a while it gets annoying.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed the film immensely and have no issue saying that it is the best film in the DCEU thus far. It fills me with the hope that Justice League will not be as big of a disaster than I thought!<br/><br/>Four and a half stars out of Five from me!"

","Short version: GO WATCH IT. <br/><br/>It might not blow you away, but in the DCCU/DCEU it's the best. But don't except ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), it's more in line with Iron Man (2008).2008 was a good year for comic book films(GB)/movies(US).<br/><br/>It's an entertaining film with good character development and the main protagonists have good chemistry together and it has some scenes were I giggled at the jokes, and that says a lot, as I no not remember laughing or even giggling at the previous DCCU films. Sadly the antagonist (bad guy(s)) are kinda... well lets just say ""Iron Man"" level. While the depiction of the god of war (Ares) is interesting it would have been nice to see more of him (maybe we'll get that in an extended version) and some more backstory, as him motives are well kinda just because we need a bad guy, also would like to see in an extended version the cause of the WWII as seen in the DCCU ;). The ending was nice and all but kinda short and the last sequence was no ware near as good as "" I am Iron Man"" (I'm comparing Wonder Woman to Iron Man because they are about on the same level, as I mentioned before).<br/><br/>*DCCU = DC Cinematic Universe *DCEU = DC Extended Universe"
"luigicastropernia","8","6","14","1 June 2017"," Wonder Woman Review
","The best DCEU (DC Extended Universe) movie so far!<br/><br/>Warner bros and DC finally made a movie that can actually compete with Marvel studios' best movies. The pacing of the story is near perfection. I'd been sitting in the theater for almost two hours and the story was still enjoyable and not that dragging, thanks to the amazing combination of properly delivered punchlines, awesome fight scenes that featured strong independent woman throwing enormous grown men firing machine guns, and those not-so-cheesy- but-can-still-be-considered-romantic moments. Transitions from one scene to another is not confusing and done properly this time relatively to their previous DCEU movies (ehem BvS). CGI is not perfect but still tolerable, those fight scenes were good enough to cover the CGI's imperfections. The ending is kind of cliché and predictable but the overall plot is still great, simple yet enjoyable. (I still have a few questions about the plot but let's save that for the future)<br/><br/>Contrary to popular belief a movie featuring Wonder Woman (or any super heroine) can actually be successful, interesting and empowering (not just for women).

","Yes, Gal Gadot is beautiful but definately not an Amazon. It's a shame people, in particular women, accept such insulting portrayals of what should be a powerful character. It's also a shame that beauty surpasses realism, even if it's a super hero show. If Batman, superman, or even aquaman were skinny, scrawny men with nice faces all hell would break loose. But when it comes to women, all that counts is a pretty face. Gadot is ultra boring in everything she is in and the rest of the cast seem to carry her. <br/><br/>I was a fan of the old Wonder Woman but that was decades ago and standards were not as high. I don't think anything will change where it comes to appropriate casting because humans are superficial and their standards are low. Maybe in my lifetime there will be a good amazon that looks strong and powerful but I doubt it. <br/><br/>As for the storyline, Wonder Woman was one dimensional and predicable as usual and at times really stupid."

It was great, exciting, funny, action packed, and also told a story that is inspiring. The technical points of this film are stunning. There is an incredible amount of beauty and aura around this film that I haven't seen in DCEU yet. Gal Gadot is fantastic as Diana and Wonder Woman. She does what RDJ did to Tony Stark's character, what Chris Evans did to Cap's character. She was incredible in this film and also is Chris Pine, who in my opinion is still, the best supporting role in any movie this year. Like I said, the action sequences are fantastic. They are exciting and great to look at. The score was really good, but still I prefer the score for Wonder Woman in BvS. Guys, this movie was fantastic. Also, this movie shows two perspectives of people and how they think. And they connect these two perspectives very beautifully. At last, I have got a movie in DC Universe that I could watch over and over again and never get bored of and I could say that I loved Wonder Woman."

"DKosty123","8","5","11","18 June 2017"," More of What A Comic Book Fan Would Expect
","This is a Wonder Woman with a much harder edge than Lynda Carter's TV version. There are some things which are different, much different than what a fan of the TV series would expect.<br/><br/>The CGI and effects are of course obviously much advanced over the TV version. Actually as a pg-13, the sexuality in this one is much less than the old TV show. I always drooled for Lynda Carter. The way Gal Godot is presented in this one, while she is attractive, she is presented more as strong than as sexy. She is a strong and determined independent Super Hero with Super Powers.<br/><br/>As far as being charming as well as sexy, that is downplayed in this one. There are a few really conservative jokes about fidelity and sex manuals, but other than those, this is a totally family friendly action film. The CGI graphics are good, and the action sequences are good though some of the action is a bit intense. Danny Huston and David Thewlis are the main baddies and Chris Pine is a more personable Steve Trevor whose role is actually upgraded to a Spy in this plot line. Trevor actually has a lot of feelings expressed at times in his role for Wonder Woman. He is much different than the Trevor on the TV series.<br/><br/>The plotting is a little muddled and crazy, but comic book fans of Wonder Woman should be happy with the results. It could have been done better though. Still, this should sell a lot of tickets. It is good."

There was never a dull moment in the movie, and it was 2 1/2 hours long. I was on the edge of my seat and felt a part of the production the entire time. This take on Wonder Woman made the audience understand her importance to the Marvel world and displayed something other than just Batman and Superman.

"OlieRendch","8","5","11","10 June 2017"," A real step-up for DC, for me. Investing characters carried me through some minor problems.
","So here we are, back in the DC Cinematic Universe that, so far, hasn't been greatly received but maybe that's all about to change. Wonder Woman stars Gal Gadot as the titular character and also boasts the cast of Chris Pine, Danny Huston, Connie Nielson, and Robin Wright. These all do great in the film but by far, Gal and Chris steal the show, their chemistry, interactions, and characters are a real joy to watch. Gal Gadot's Diana is such an interesting character as this powerful, but naive Amazon woman experiencing early 20th century Europe. She conveys strength, humor, and emotion really well and looks great in the action scenes. Chris Pine is classic Chris Pine which is a bonus to any movie whether it's a science-fiction space franchise or a Lindsy Lohan chick flick, and so here in Wonder Woman, he delivers another entertaining character in Steve Trevor.<br/><br/>The other cast include Steve's group of merry men he must team up with and I have to say I enjoyed them quite a bit, they each had a distinct personality and even their own little personal battles to deal with. On the villain front, I can't say much because of spoilers but I really enjoyed Danny Huston and Elana Anaya's evil duo, they reminded me a lot of classic 60s villains for some reason. And this movie does that a few times, it gives you the sense of classic movies, whether it's the nods to 1970s Superman or just the slowed down nature of the plot, Wonder Woman just felt familiar and comfortable.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, as I say, had quieter moments and they didn't pack it full of action which made a nice change to the usual format; it really mad us feel for these characters and care when things happen. The beginning had a bit of an unsteady pace and the climax was a bit generic CGI battle but because the characters were so investing I didn't mind as much. And just seeing the aesthetic of ancient Greek culture mixing with World War I was an interesting visual in itself.<br/><br/>In the end, I feel Wonder Woman is a real step-up for DC, whether it was the director, Patty Jenkins, the writers or a mix of a few things. The film isn't perfect but I'd be lying if I said I did not enjoy it."

For teenage boys everywhere she was Wonder Woman made flesh.<br/><br/>DC Comics have ventured into solo female superhero movie territory before with poor results. We had 1984's ill-conceived Supergirl with Helen Slater and 2004's critically- panned CatWoman with Halle Berry. Even Marvel, who can do no wrong these days have had their fair share of solo female super-hero disasters: Elektra anyone? And so DC, having faced critical and fan-based scorn for 2016's Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad, dip their toe into the superhero waters once more. To say there is a lot riding on the success of Wonder Woman is a truism. It's the next test for DC and it's in a genre with a poor track record: single female superhero movies.<br/><br/>Director Patty Jenkins has an excellent track record with 2003's Monster being one of my stand-out favourites. It also has the honour of earning Charlize Theron her first Oscar (Best Actress in a Leading Role). So we know Jenkins can tell a story. As with all origin superhero films, we have to have the back-story together with an ""it's all up there on the screen"" action sequence in Act III. Israel's Gal Gadot appeared as Wonder Woman in last year's Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Her performance in that was one of the stand-out moments of an otherwise dull movie. So hopes are high that she can carry a feature-length movie on her own. The good news is that she can. Supporting her and providing the love interest is Capt. Kirk himself, Chris Pine as Major Steve Trevor.<br/><br/>In terms of story we have the obligatory origin-story. We discover that before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, raised on a sheltered island paradise and trained to be an unconquerable warrior. The island has been hidden from the world by Zeus but when a pilot crashes on the island's shores and tells of a massive conflict raging in the outside world, Diana leaves her home, convinced she can stop the threat. All of this happens in Act I and we get performances from Robin Wright as her trainer. We are also introduced to one of the villains of the piece, Ludendorf played with scenery-chewing aplomb by Danny Huston.<br/><br/>In Act II our heroine is brought to London, to the heart of the Allied war effort. IN this Pygmaleon-esque sequence we see Diana being introduced to society. Most of the film's humour resides in this Act and it is a delight. Gal Gadot shows her acting chops and comic timing and proves a good foil for Chris Pine. Lucy Davis shines as the female role-adviser and hapless carrier of the sword! Diana and Steve decide to go to ""the front"" and try to stop the development or release of a new German weapon. More comedy ensues as they recruit the team they need.<br/><br/>Once we get to the front, the tone changes. We witness through Diana's eyes and her experiences, the true horror of war: not just on the soldiers but on the towns and families caught up in the war. In typical hero's-journey pacing, it is a real road of trials for Wonder Woman. Her experiences, her apotheosis in Act II set up our hero for the final showdown in Act III. As is required by modern-superhero story-telling, there is an epic final battle. That's where we leave the narrative for fear of spoilers.<br/><br/>This film's strength is in it's heart and Jenkins has proved herself a master of telling stories that resonate with audiences. She never allows the film to lose that heart and it is a better movie for it. It's not without it's flaws. In particular, Act I, on the island is scattered and at times disorientating. A minor quibble in an otherwise good origin story.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is simply outstanding. Her range in this film shows she is capable of more. She is slated to reprise Wonder Woman in DC's Justice League due later this year. For now, as Princess of the Amazonians, she rules all before her.<br/><br/>A solid 4 out of 5"

","There was not much expected from this flick and was I wrong!! The movie has definitely set the background and stage for 'Wonder Woman' to take her rightful place with the league of overcrowded male superheroes.<br/><br/>Refreshing change to watch a female kick ass and look convincing and sexy while doing it. All the actors put up a fine display but are finally destined to play second fiddle as the show belongs to 'Wonder Woman' and Gal Gadot does a 'wonder job' of it. <br/><br/>The transition of Diana, Princess of Themyscira, Daughter of Hippolyta to a WW1 ravaged London is convincing. However, more convincing is the fact that this demi-goddess connects with the audience not only her action but her display of emotions. A wonderful effort by the production team and I hope an independent sequel is considered staged in 'present day' instead of reserving Wonder Woman to only play a part of the Justice League."

","WONDER WOMEN is definitely a wonderful movie and without any doubt its worth every penny. unlike any other DC comics, the movie is totally refreshing with it's WWI plot. although the movie plot was a bit expected but thank god for GAL GADOT presence, it's all her show she did a marvelous as ""wonder women"" and of course nailed it. her action sequences were actually pretty good through out the movie and believe me she did fantastic job and as of CHRIS PINE i guess he did his job like supporting the wonder women or sacrificing for ...... i don't know watch it and fill it by yourself!!"
"SivakumarBalachandran","8","5","11","9 June 2017"," This Wonder Woman will make sure to sweep you off your feet
","My take on Wonder Woman 2017: Patty Jenkins ""Wonder Woman"" dives into the origin of the female superhero and her transformation from an innocent desperate wannabe warrior to an inspiring superhero who stopped the World War I. <br/><br/>The story takes us through Greek mythology and off course, all- important Greek Gods mentioned. Therefore, an innocent princess from an isolated island Themyscira filled with the only woman called the Amazons embarks on a journey to stop the World War I as she believes it's the war raised to by Ares God of wars to end humanity. The interesting part of this superhero movie is there is lots of thought process and messages before any fight by the protagonist, unlike other comic superheroes. The screenplay flows with a good pace and keeps you amused until the end supported by effective VFX. <br/><br/>On the performances, obviously, Gadot stands out with her roaring performance making us wanting more. Gadot on her niche avatar as wonder woman is fierce, bold, naïve, loyal, focused, spectacularly fashioned, charming, charismatic and which makes her undoubtedly the wonder woman. I felt as if she was born to play this role. Chris Pine as Steve the British spy and the love interest of Wonder Woman delivers solid and his character has good scope in the play, unlike brief other comic hero's love interest. On that note, this movie has more romance. <br/><br/>Get in and I am sure the Wonder Woman will wonderfully sweep you off your feet.<br/><br/>PS: Loved Gadot's Middle Eastern/Israeli accents so do watch it in the English version. For those who felt Gadot is thin slender and not suitable for a superhero I suppose even spider man on reality is not macho and when he dons the costume boasts power. So I felt same rule applies for female superheroes as well. <br/><br/>I will rate an easy 8 on 10 and I watched it twice in IMAX 3D -By Sivakumar Balachandran"
"ironhorse_iv","8","5","11","9 June 2017"," I kinda like this film. For the most part, this movie was mostly wonderful.
","The world's most famous female superhero has finally made it to the big screen & surprising, it was pretty good. It was sensational. Directed by Patty Jenkins & based on the DC Comics character of the same name by Dr. William Moulton Marston, the Warner Bros film exceeded all expectations with its well-made visual storytelling. Proving, once and for all, that a super-heroine film could work, with the right crew to bring it to life. Some critics goes as far, as calling it, the best DC Extended Universe film to date. Does this movie deserve all this praise? In my opinion, I believe, yes. The thought provoking themes that this movie, showed, with the moral dilemma of doing the greater good was very compelling. However, it's without a few nit picky flaws. While, for the most part, I found the idea of an ancient, warrior princess, Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) fighting, against the Kaiser and his troops in the trenches of World War 1, interesting and unique. I do have to say, it does sounds like screenwriter, Allen Heinberg is trying to copy other comic studio's ideas, by having a story that combine the best things about Marvel's 2011's films, 'Thor' & 'Captain America: The First Avenger', together. Still, it does pull away, just enough to make this story seem like its own. However, the ending to that story, was a bit muddled, due to the fact, that DC felt that the presence of Ares, the god of war, was indeed needed and his corruption on humankind was truly taking place, during the course of the film. Without spoiling, too much, about it. I thought, the movie would have work, better, if Ares was truly gone & it was indeed, human beings that selfishly causing the war and violence, amount each other. It would be so much, more powerful message, than an ancient God subtly giving humans ideas and inspirations to kill each other. After all, it doesn't make sense, within the means of the story. In this film, they stated out, that the villain corrupted men, in order to help him, slew all his fellow gods and their human follows. If we're to believe, that all the ancient Gods are dead and the Amazons that were sworn to protect humankind is in hiding, then, why would Ares, have his armies, fight upon, each other, rather than invading the Amazons kingdom of Themyscira? The only clue, I have is, the fact, that he might do this, in hope, of finally wiping them out, of existence, but it does leave, the question, why. In the comics, Ares want to keep war, eternal, because he lives off, that. So, why in the film, is he whispering doomsday levels of destroyed ideas to Dr. Isabella Maru AKA Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya) that would wipe the human race out and pave way to a new paradise? Also, deceptive master plan of keeping the peace, also doesn't add up, because it would killed, what makes him, 'him'. To add more wood on the fire, the whole temptation of Diana to kill humans, also doesn't make sense, too, seeing that she killed a large amount of them, before, meeting him. That whole clichés exchange of showing mercy felt a little to 1983's 'Return of the Jedi', for me. Despite that, I have little to no problem with the other story telling clichés, because they work so well. Still, if I have to nitpick, I believe the movie's opening, had a little too much of exposition dump. Starting your film, with a recurrence, only go back to an earlier memorable that include a history Greek mythology lesson, and a further flashback of stealing a diary might be, pushing it. However, I did find, other things, a bit annoying. The slow motion, unrealistic jumps and flips stunts from the Amazons, were a bit infuriating. Plus, the German villains, a bit too cartoony evil for my taste. Also, as a history buff. I found the fictionalized version of General Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and his fondness of steroid gas, kinda jarring, due to the lack of clarified to his character. I would had, like the film to explore, more of him and likewise, Scottish sharpshooter, Charlie (Ewen Bremner), because it seem like their subplot, during the action scenes seem a bit abandoned. Nevertheless, most of the action sequence, using CGI and practical, traditional special effects work out for me, even some parts of the film might be too gruesome for a PG-13 film. It's nice to see, a DC movie have action moments that, weren't all pitch dark. There were some color in this somewhat desaturated gritty film. The acting that came with this movie, for the most part, was also amazing, with Gal Galot and actor, Chris Pine standing out. These two, really have great chemistry with each other. It really did seem like the romantic elements, between their characters, could had happen. It also got emotional at times. The heartbreaking moments really did mean something. Still, the movie does have some light humor. I found the fish out of water jokes, funny. Even charming. Also, the music by composer, Rupert Gregson-Williams & Hans Zimmer was beautiful and intense to listen to. Overall: I have to say, this movie shows that Wonder Woman has come from a long way, from the days of being over sexual objectification and underused. I also love how the movie doesn't go too extreme on the other side, with it, coming off as misandristic. It really did find a balance with both the viewpoints of men & women. Because of that, I found myself, liking the movie for entertainment values, rather than hating it, because it takes one side. In the end, its shows in the box office, as both sexes are able to enjoy this movie. That's pretty swell. This movie will paved the way for more lead super-heroine projects for sure. Because of that, I highly recommended seeing this movie."

","Here goes. Wonder Woman is worthy, I am not in any way at all, taking that away from it, however, this film has faults too, just too severe to justify a 93% rating. Wonder Woman is a solid 7.2/10, but I feel when it comes to DC, many critics and fans alike just seem to miss the appropriate appreciation. BvS and Suicide Squad were rated way too low, and Man of Steel was just robbed of its excellence, and now, Wonder Woman is rated way too high. 93% is The Dark Knight, The Avengers, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Iron Man level... Wonder Woman, is not that.<br/><br/>Firstly, let me get into its positives. The script, is well constructed and executed. The story is awesome, cohesive and gripping. Gal Gadot for me is always only as good as her talent allows her to be. She is always, or at least, most of the time, adequate for her roles, and it's no different here. Chris Pine, I'm an absolute fan, and I was afraid that his talents would be misrepresented by a forced dialogue and script; what an amazing surprise it was to see that Jenkins and Co. nailed him so well.<br/><br/>Now, the problems that Wonder Woman had. I'll mention this one first, because it's importance is based on Warner Bros. making the same mistakes as they did with previous DCEU installments, except this time, it's the other way around.<br/><br/>Wonder Wonder, with the awesome script and performances it accomplished, deserved the budget BvS had, and BvS deserved the budget Wonder Woman had (sadly BvS's substandardness could only be known after the fact). This film was impacted negatively by its shoddy editing, questionable cinematography at so many points, and just badly executed fight sequences, all because the budget was thin, based on Warner Bros.'s fear from past outcomes - and we've become accustomed to a certain level of quality, or at least I know I have. There were even points, where Wonder Woman herself, seemed like nothing but a computer generated concoction.<br/><br/>Ares!!! Why? Why was he included in this Wonder Woman? He was a perfect setup as Wonder Woman's ultimate nemesis, in later installments such as, Wonder Woman 3 perhaps. The writers and Jenkins built him up and set him up PERFECTLY... Just so perfectly, but then, he was wasted on a shoestring budget, 15 minutes towards the end of the movie, with armor equivalent to Tony Stark's Mark I when he was stuck in the cave. Ares, who's not only the God of War, but also, the Death God was incredibly, just so unbelievably wasted, and this, cannot by anyone, be denied.<br/><br/>Lastly I'll mention, whether you like it or not; Wonder Woman, as enjoyable as it was, was very, very reminiscent of 1. Thor and 2. Captain America: The First Avenger, all the way down to the British flag waving at the end of the movie. I kept trying to overlook it, but as the story progressed, the harder it became, to a point where it felt like I was watching Captain Thor: The First League Member.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is awesome, better than Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2., it truly is. The script is on point (though arguably, Steve didn't need to approach the end like he did), Gal was nice, Chris was amazing, the humor was damn near perfect, Rupert Gregson-Williams is deadly on the score and everybody else played their parts like pros, but I can't help but feel that, Warner Bros. played too many of their cards, because Ares, was not at all supposed to be the main villain of this movie. Ares's wasted appearance, the lackluster budget (and keep in mind, this is a blockbuster and a proper budget is part of its armor) and a story too, reminiscent of Marvel's previous installments, compromise what was actually, something awesome to watch.<br/><br/>Is it a 93%? Not by a long shot whatsoever. Is it a good movie however, hells yeah it is. 7.2/10."
"Svenstadt","8","5","11","4 June 2017"," Just what was needed in a sea of politically correct SFX garbage.
","Edit - something I missed during my initial review - What really struck me about the film was the really blatant feminism of this whole thing. For I think the first time in film really, you have a male lead playing the feminine role, and the female lead playing a man's role! Chris Pine can pull that off well - he's kind of a small man, very polite, sort of a damsel in distress at times. And you have Gal Gadot who has a deep, agressive voice at times, pushing on without cease til the end. Chris Pine is kind of the T-1000 character - he is an allied spy and he uses this ability several times to infiltrate, and is kind of the conscience of the film.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This movie is, in short, astounding! Chris Pine is a great actor to bring into this part, although I thought that at times he seemed a bit preachy and couldn't let go of his Captain Kirk persona. The setting is World War I, but at times it seemed like an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, where the humans help the aliens navigate the culture of the day. In short: it gets old, but fortunately it didn't go too far. As an admirer of history, there were nuggets of the prevailing culture of the day that even the hero, Diana, the wonder woman, found hard to grasp. Gal Gadot's beauty carried the movie away, her every pose in the movie was beautiful. There is no such thing as a bad scene with her in it!<br/><br/>There are lots of references to ancient Hellenic (Greek mythology) which I found endearing. The action scenes were pretty solid, although I thought there could have been more.<br/><br/>The movie is not silly like some action movies like Independence Day 1 & 2 which is a good thing.<br/><br/>The themes were not political in nature which is another plus. The theme seems to be: man himself is a beast who brings evil upon himself. The entire film flows very well together. I think the reason this film is popular is because it is something fresh and new and different.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot's performance was good. However, I found that the character was a little wet-behind-the-ears. Maybe this was intentional, as she was supposed to portray a naive young woman, but I felt that in several scenes, she should have scratched her head and asked more questions and been a little more reflective and less hormonal. You get the impression that the writers / directors were missing several character development points and plot points I thought went unanswered. <br/><br/>I wish to compare her performance to Milla Jovovich in 5th Element. At the end of that movie, MJ shows a little bit of vulnerability in her character. I wonder if Gal Gadot is capable of the same range as an actress as MJ, but this may be scriptural problem."

","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 ) <br/><br/>GRADE: B <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Another superhero movie with some style and a willingness to establish its characters first and let the action follow.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: The legend of Wonder Woman and a new film franchise is born.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Wonder Woman (2017) owes so much of its success to two women, one in front of the camera and one behind the lens. Their contributions make this the first of many entries into a profitable future film series. <br/><br/>Gal Gadot play Princess Diana, daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, and she is perfectly cast as our Amazon warrior. She is terrific in this role. The Israeli actress has star power personified and she also displays some nice comic timing too. Patty Jenkins, her director, does a remarkable job of focusing on the human story while staging the action sequence with real flair. She does not sacrifice the hand-to-hand combat expected in this type of movie and plays up the relationship between the goddess and the mortal.<br/><br/>That mortal is Steve Trevor, played winningly by Chris Pine. This charming actor can play the dashing hero and WWI aviator without much challenge, but he brings along with him a sweet vulnerability and slight goofiness that makes his character endearing. The chemistry between him and Ms. Gadot, dare I say, makes this film work wonders and elevates it above the rest of the stereotypical DC or Marvel universe of superheroes.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Allan Heinberg establishes the action scenes amid more quieter moments that fortify the relationship of the mismatched lovers. It creates a strong role model and allows Diana to play the role of a stranger in a strange land, that place being WWI Germany. As she comes to terms with the cruelty of war and mankind's choices to perpetuate this violence, the film makes its heavy-handed message, at least, more intriguing. Unfortunately Wonder Woman's golden lariat can break free of the standard formula of the comic book superhero genre, beginning with the mythological origins of our heroine and ending in a typical slam-bang showdown of overproduced CGI. Fortunately, in between, is that tender love story that ropes in the moviegoer's interest.<br/><br/>Supporting characters never achieve much depth. The bad guys are so obvious (even a twist here and there, lacked an element of surprise). The good guys are stock misfits that aren't given much to do. Still, Danny Huston, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, David Thewlis and Lucy Davis bring some needed class to the movie. <br/><br/>Ms. Jenkins has created a well crafted film and, unlike so many of the recent action flicks, stages the battle scenes clearly. Thankfully, there is little upfront close-ups and jittery camera moves. (Credit goes to cinematographer Matthew Jensen as well.) One can actually see the action, a rarity with action-fantasy blockbusters these days. Especially effective is her vision of Diana's war in No-Man's Land set piece, the film's highlight. (Although it seems more realistic to conclude that Diana's form-fitting WW outfit and bare skin may have unified the Allied forces more than her warrior skills leading them to victory.) entertains<br/><br/>Wonder Woman may not be very original or ground-breaking, but it does enable women to take the reins in the usually all-male dominating world of filmmaking and deliver one of the better comic book superhero blockbuster in quite a long time. Hear them roar!"

"justinwfirestone","4","9","24","3 June 2017"," Not the DC savior
","Ohmygod how can anyone watch this 141-minute chore and think it's somehow breathed fresh air into the lead balloons that are DC Comics movies? On a more positive note, because there were so many trailers featuring Taron Egerton, Ansel Elgort, and Dane DeHaan, I finally realized they are actually three different dudes who get asked to be in movies.<br/><br/>Origin stories usually suck. At least this time we don't have to watch Uncle Ben get murdered again. We start on a hidden island that is hidden so well that you can't find it unless you fly into it or sail to it. Men are absent, until Chris Pine shows up, who claims to be ""above average"" through some very, very below average dialogue. This Wonder Woman movie is different, because it's set in WWI, and we get to fight the Germans! Red Skull and Captain America had to wait through the 1930s before taking their turn. Logan was splitting skulls way back in the Civil War, I believe. Are we going to get an Aquaman movie set during one of the Opium Wars, I hope, I hope!<br/><br/>Evil, we know, is nothing by itself. It has to co-opt people and make them do bad things. And if evil can get another piece of evil to join it, say like Star Lord's dad or Darth Vader tried to do, there's no telling how bad bad can get. Good thing there's good people in the world, heroes and gods, to keep us from killing ourselves too much.<br/><br/>The plot meanders and heavily paws at noble ideals of love, peace, and human failure. Humans don't deserve Amazonian protection, nor do they deserve movies like Wonder Woman. Ares wants war forever, and Hollywood wants us to eat these garbage bites forever. Why are all the DC movies so dark, so stormy, so serious?<br/><br/>Oh, we get some light-hearted clothes shopping in post-Victorian London. It's awful funny watching an Amazon shop for dresses. Women don't need men for pleasure, but anyone with a vibrator could tell you that.<br/><br/>It's good to see Chris Pine, Chris Pratt, and Chris Evans (the Chris Syndicate) getting so much work these days."

","Okay, so today IMDb has officially made me question my sanity. Came here today after a torrid 2 and a half hours of watching Wonder Woman and Womder Wimp (Chris Pine) at the cinema fully expecting a score of 6 or below. I would be willing to accept a 7, even perhaps a 7.5 given that these are early days and the ratings usually dip... but above 8! Are you kidding me?!?<br/><br/>This movie is best described as a boring hodgepodge of random sequences smattered with some terrible acting, the pain of which is only lessened by Gal Godot's almost divine beauty which probably had every male in the audience wishing he were Chris Pine (insipid as he is).<br/><br/>To break it down: Story: 6/10: An average and cliché plot told in a very uninspiring fashion with the most obvious of twists and the standard moral dilemmas of the uncomplicated virtuous.<br/><br/>Direction: 3/10: I think honestly perhaps even I might be able to direct a movie about as well as it was done here. Lets have a moment of silence for the art of story telling because somehow, in a frickin 2.5 hour long movie, the director manages to make you feel NOTHING for any of the characters. Literally nothing. Chris Pine dying had about the same effect that that mildly annoying fruit fly that was buzzing around my popcorn did. If anything him dying was as satisfying as watching the fly make its way to someone else's popcorn.<br/><br/>Acting: 3/10: No words. No depth. Nothing.<br/><br/>Script: 4/10: In a world of the quirky quip humor of marvel counterbalanced with the dark grittiness of DC I feel DC tried to play along the edge and came up vastly short. The humor was awkward, tired and almost cringeworthy in places, while the film lost out on the gravitas which (for better or worse) had become the DC hallmark.<br/><br/>Action Sequences: 8.5/10: I'm going to separate action sequences from direction because I feel it has more to do with the cinematographer or the animators. This film had some solid almost live action seeming choreographed sequences. Really enjoyed all parts with Gal and the many amazons swirling and destroying enemies left / right and center.<br/><br/>All in all I feel this film was so encumbered with the shackles of pushing a feminist agenda as well as the general lack of creativity there seems to be at WB these days that it really couldn't deliver anything close to its potential. This has killed my hopes for DC and WB who can only push this as far as their marketing arms can go.<br/><br/>Sorry also don't mean to say all women can't direct superhero films but SURELY, SURELY, this one can't. Gotta call a spade a spade, being PC be damned.<br/><br/>Cheerio. Don't watch it."

","This is undoubtedly the best DCEU movie. Wonder Woman packs a punch yet is subtle and enjoyable for almost all audiences. Action sequences are so well directed and depiction of Amazons is mind blowing. Gal Gadot completely owns the role and her acting, dialogue delivery is very natural. Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright do great justice to the roles of Queen Hippolyta and General Antiope. Chris Pine delivers a strong performance as well. Compared to Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman, this movie is a far superior product in terms of story line, direction & visual effects. DC should stick to this formula for its upcoming movies....."
"AlexFalzon","5","9","24","1 June 2017"," Not wonderful, but better than anything else in the DCEU.
","Well, it's finally here. I think it's safe to say that this is one of the more anticipated superhero releases of the last decade, which makes it all the more unfortunate that it had to play within the boundaries of the DC Extended Universe, of which it is the fourth entry. It should be stated up-front that while Wonder Woman is not quite good enough to affect the overall quality of the franchise in any meaningful way, it is certainly better than any of the three films preceding it. The DCEU is on a steady climb upwards; let's hope they don't plateau any time soon.<br/><br/>Our framing device sees the Amazing Amazon, in modern-day Paris, receive a photograph from Batman, along with a note asking to one day hear her story. This story begins with her childhood on the Amazonian island Themyscira (there actually is a cute little Paradise Island reference in there, too), her development into a warrior princess and her eventual meeting with the pilot Steve Trevor, who crash-lands into the ocean nearby. After hearing about the Great War, Diana determines that Ares must be behind it and resolves to return to the world of mankind with Trevor in order to vanquish the God of War.<br/><br/>The fish-out-of-water elements work greatly, not only in terms of the larger cities and groups of people but also in more intimate settings between Diana and Trevor. The clash of cultures is as thought- provoking as it is hilarious, and these scenes were a great way to let the audience catch a breath between action sequences without getting bored.<br/><br/>Because boring, this film is not. At times it can be frustrating, illogical, incoherent and just plain sloppy, but it's never boring. An example of the sloppiness can be found when Trevor refers to the War as ""The War to End All Wars"", before Diana and her mother exit the room and Diana says ""You heard him, mother! He called it 'A War Without End!'"". That's just lazy.<br/><br/>The CGI isn't great, and this is especially noticeable in a few scenes where someone falls or leaps from a great height. There's one particularly glaring example where a character is shot in slow- motion, and it's not at all convincing. The music was good, though I was a little disappointed that Wonder Woman's main theme from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was used so sparingly. I actually thought that was a big highlight of that movie's score, and was hoping to hear it play over the more badass moments (like when Wonder Woman fights a bunch of bad guys with her lasso; that was excellent!)<br/><br/>Where it all fell apart more for me was towards the end. Wonder Woman is sure that Ares is behind the Great War, while Trevor insists that mankind just sucks. Let it suffice to say that the filmmakers attempt to have it both ways, and the result makes little sense. There is also a stupidly pointless death that completely took me out of the film.<br/><br/>And so, while it's not a bad movie, the DCEU is still yet to give us a good one. Wonder Woman is probably on par with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the rival MCU's latest film, so at this stage it appears that Fox's Logan is, for now, still the best superhero film of the year. If the DCEU follows its current trend, though, November's Justice League should be an enjoyable watch.<br/><br/>Oh, and Wonder Woman is also apparently telekinetic, now, stopping metal with her mind. Considering she already has her bracelets and shockwaves to accomplish the same feat, this felt out of place.<br/><br/>http://alexfalzon.com/wonder-woman/ - for more reviews."

","This isn't any easier to make than it was for Aquaman. I say that because of the type of character that has to be made interesting and avoid being too cheesy.

Anyway, I still enjoyed the film and I bought the DVD, So happy ending....."

Anyone who says it is the biggest or the best superhero movie of all time is having a lend of themselves, but it was pretty cool and only missed the mark a dozen times from making it as good as a Black Panther or Aquaman.
WW's supporting cast was a bit of a corny crew, as were the casting/characters and usage of the 3 main villains.
Chris Pine... just doesn't do it for me, he is just not as charismatic or entertaining as ANY of the Marvel ones like Hemsworth, Evans or Pratt...

","At the time this movie came out i was really unmotivated to study for my finals and i went to watch this movie. It was the best decision I ever made. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. It definitely gave me a little push to keep going. It's such an uplifting and inspiring story.
I think that what differentiates this movie from other Superhero movies is that Diana comes from a place of Love and thats what moves her. Not revenge, not pain but love. And ultimately it proves to be the best weapon.
There are also some really incredible scenes throughout the entire movie that leave u awed and surprinsingly make u feel powerful and capable of everything.
If u need any more reasons to watch the movie then know that Diana entering the world of Men is some great comedy. The Cast is perfect and deliver great acting.

"tinybunnysnail","9","2","3","26 June 2018"," 10/9... for a superhero movie
","Unfortunately making superhero movies seem to me to be inherently difficult. It's just a tricky concept I guess. So far, only the X: First Class and 
X-Men: Days of Future Past has really impressed me... and now, Wonder Woman!<br/><br/>Quick story recap, our hero Diana is raised on an isolated Amazon island, gets trained and discovers she has unusual amounts of powers. Next, a plane crashes through the islands force field carrying a pilot escaping from the Germans during WWI. This becomes the wake up call for Diana to realize war is still a thing outside of her protected paradise, and she joins the pilot to go out into the world for the first time to Fix it - not as simple as her idealized mind would have it.<br/><br/>First of all, if you don't like historical revisionism this (nor above mentioned superhero titles) might not be your thing. But if you acknowledge it's all fantasy and a certain amount of artistic liberty can be allowed in this area if done right, then you shouldn't have a problem.<br/><br/>In the end success or failure for me in any movie (or book, comic etc) is all about the characters. You can watch a movie with pretty much no story if the characters are interesting and compelling, but no matter how great a story, it won't it matter if the characters don't capture you in the slightest. Be it love or distain, they have to make you feel something.
Here you gotta hand it to Gal Gadot playing Diana. Her Wonder Woman is absolutely captivating. You will not be able to take your eyes of her for a minute, and I don't mean her looks (though stunning).
Her combination av strength, naïveté and unintentional humor is not only on spot, it feels completely novel but still manages to be 100% believable, which is vigorously refreshing. Gadot might not have much acting experience but you wouldn't believe it as she simply glows in this.
Chris Pine also makes for a compelling sidekick as Steve, completely inferior in physical power, but superior in his experience of the ""modern"" world. Introducing the completely inexperienced Diana to it let's him take the lead to a certain amount, creating a nice power balance and sets up for some well rounded humour.
And speaking of the humor thank GOD for the lack of slapsticks! The jokes are never in your face and manages to feel fresh and original for a change.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect movie; which drags it down from a (superhero movie) 10. The villain/villains was miscast to me and not super interesting (The Germans all being the bad guys is So Done, and seeing as the scene at least was WWI there was an opportunity to offer a bit more grayscale but alas, no...) , although the fighting scenes were beautifully choreographed I'm afraid the budget does not hold up for the CGI to age very well etc... 
But the novelty and charm of the characters, the daring and original message of the film, and the pure awesomeness of some kick-ass fight scenes more than make up for it.<br/><br/>And finally, can we please let go of the Female Superhero thing a bit? Sure I'm as happy as anyone there's a bit more balance in the genre but for it to dominate the reviews this much is doing the movie a disservice. Female, Male, Alien, AI robot, who cares as long as it's an interesting and well played character."

You have to at least admit this has been the best DC (apart from Batman) film yet? So what it's not realistic. Their comic book heroes for god sake it's not meant to be realistic. Took me out of reality, I enjoyed it. Had a few funny moments and just enough. Had moments where I couldn't take my eyes off. Built up the action just right, I don't know what more people want. I guess they expect it to be more realistic like Batman? Batman didn't have any powers, Wonder Woman was a ""god"" so how do you expect this film to relate to reality?! Would watch again.

","I went into this movie about six weeks after its initial theater release not knowing what to expect. I knew that it was getting high marks from pretty much everyone, but I still was not convinced. When I walked out of theater I was shocked at how good it really was. Here's what I loved about the movie:<br/><br/>1.) The humor was on point. I can't say how many times I busted up laughing the first time I watched it and the humor still gets me laughing even after seeing it four times. Everyone plays off each other perfectly for optimal laughs and very few jokes fell flat for me. <br/><br/>2.) Everyone does a great job acting. Gal Gadot pulls off a great naive, young Wonder Woman who is fascinated by literally everything for the first half of the movie. Her emotional transitions are pulled off well throughout the whole movie as well. Her role as Wonder Woman is one of the best superhero characters in my opinion. Chris Pine also does an awesome job portraying a WWI soldier who doesn't really know how to handle this whole Wonder Woman thing. In this movie, I truly got behind the characters.<br/><br/>3). The action is interesting and a lot of fun. None of the action scenes got too long and all of them were enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>4.) I liked the story. It's not often that we get a movie based in WWI. Everything flowed well and the villains were convincing. I actually cared about the plot because it was interesting and engaging.<br/><br/> I ended up seeing Wonder Woman twice in theater and now I own it on Blu Ray. It was one of my favorite movies of 2017. I strongly recommend it!"

From her mythical beginnings on a hidden away Amazonian island and into WWI due to a fluke encounter with modern society. Throughout the movie Diana struggles to comprehend modern societies' appetite for war and destruction as this is a stark contrast to her peaceful world. She fears the God Eres is the main culprit and makes it her personal mission to stop Eres. Will she succeed? How will she adapt within a modern society? This point is the driver for much of the movie's humor, which is complimented by entertainingly slick and rich action as well as he modern lasso and powerful bracelets. This was a high quality, CGI rich, Hollywood blockbuster with an engaging story and fun scenes. Sure one can pick away at it but its rewardingly fun with properly set expectations."

"leonblackwood","8","2","3","31 December 2017"," A Great Watch!
","Review:
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I think that Gal Gadot was the perfect choice to play Wonderwoman. The action was top form, and you can see were every penny of the big budget went. The beginning of the film follows Diana (Wonderwoman) as a child, and it shows how she gained her powers, against her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) wishes. After doing her daily training with Antiope (Robin Wright), Diana witnesses a plane crash into the ocean, so she rushes to save the pilot, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), who turns out to be a spy for the Army. When Steve tells the Amazonians about his conflict with the German army, Diana decides to leave the sheltered paradise island, because she believes that she will come across the God of all evil, Ares, who has caused the war. During there mission, Steve gathers his close friends, Sameer (Said Taghmaoui), Charlie (Ewen Bremner) and the Chief (Eugene Brave Rock) to get some precious information to his superiors but Diana has only one thing on her mind, to find Ares and to put an end to all evil. Its quite an intelligent story which is well put together by the director, and it's interesting throughout. The spectacular action scenes, and stunning scenery certainly gives the Marvel camp a run for there money, and the touch of wit from Steve's secretary, Etta (Lucy Davis), covered another element which worked very well. I was surprised not to see any of the other DC action heroes making an appearance, and I was expecting some additional footage at the end credits but apart from that, this movie is definitely worth a watch, and it has to go down as one of my favourites for this year. Great Watch!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Patty Jenkins, 46, who also brought you Monster starring Charlize Theron, which earned Theron an Academy award. As this is Jenkins 2nd movie to date, she has certainly got an high reputation in Hollywood by bringing ""Girl Power"" movies to the big screen, and after watching the bonus material, she tried her utmost to stay true to the Wonderwoman legacy, which everyone has grown to love. Gal Gadot, 32, previously starred in Fast & Furious, Date Night, Knight & Day, Fast & Furious 5, 6 and 7, the great Criminal starring Kevin Costner, Keeping Up With The Joneses, Triple 9 and Batman vs. Superman but it's really this movie that has made her a major star. Her attractive looks make her stand out from the rest but her action skills in this movie has shown that she is willing to put in the work. The only reason why I wouldn't give this movie full marks is because it seemed a bit distant from the other DC comic movies, and it does take some time to get going but apart from that, it definitely gets the thumbs up from me.<br/><br/>Budget: $149million
Worldwide Gross: $821.5million<br/><br/>Genre: Action, Adventure and Fantasy
Cast: Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Saiid Taghmaoui, Ewen Bremner, Lucy Davis and James Cosmo. 8/10"

","Gal Gadot is a true star she sizzles as Wonder woman and cements herself in Hollywood's glorious history. They should give her a star now!

"PartialMovieViewer","10","8","21","19 June 2017"," One of My Top 4 This Year...Maybe Top Two
","OK I had plenty of preconceived notions about this movie. Let's see, it's about a woman super hero (which is a pretty popular theme now-a-days); I assumed it would be buried in man-hating hysteria (even more popular than female superheroes), and only women were aloud to the premier (well that should seal the deal right there). And then I saw the bio of the main startwo years a member of the I.D.F. (I know it's a compulsory thingbut she actually did walk the walk (unlike the majority of the Hollyweirdos constantly vomiting political wisdom.)) With that bit of knowledgeGal Gadot already earned hero status with me. So – I went – with my wife. My hopes were hiwould I be let down or not? There was plenty of flash and splash all over the screen - as would be expected in any super-dooper extravaganza. Pyrotechnics all over the place and CGI – OMGthere was plenty of that as well. Oddly though, I noticed something I could not put my finger on at firstand then it hit me. Unlike many others of this genre, this movie has an excellent plot, flows with excellent writing; the characters are superbly developed; surprisingly there was no silly political sub-plot, and this flick had a supporting cast perfectly tailored for the story. With all the cool stuff going on there is that one person who actually cooks the stew, and that is the director. Talk about a strong director, wow. No meandering with this storyno experimentally weird camera shots...just straight to the point and always moving forward. Great job Patty Jenkinsexcellent workI need to see more. Unlike many other super movies, I actually like the main character...and yes...I am a guy...male decisive type...and I related to her...another...OMG. Granted, she is no, ""Groot"", but Wonder Woman is not supposed to be a ""Groot"" she is ""Wonder Woman."" I do hope we see more of Wonder Woman with the same cast and same top-notch directing. In my opinion - the rest of the D.C. heroes can do their own 'gang' movie...Wonder Woman can stand alone, Gadon's acting excels over the other camp 'heroes'. SadlyI can't see any of the other super-characters even close to the same quality and depth as Ms. Gadot's portrayal and the thought of adding 'Man of Steal"" or ""Batman"" to a group-movie with 'WW' would just drag her character down. Great movieI loved it. Final Note: remember she is an Amazon, and if you missed what they were, don't bother reading about them, the words are too big for you to understand."

","Don't get me wrong: I really enjoyed the Wonder Woman movie, I think it was very well conceived: the Amazons island was stunning and action scenes, are breathtaking. Camera movement are very dynamics and slow motion is placed at the right moment.<br/><br/>Movie is setted during the First World War. Diana is forced to see the cruelty of the it. She is a fighter in every sense, not only with her superpowers, but also with words: she always argue with humans about injustices of the world, but the only one that really understand her is Steve. The chemistry between the two is amazing, and their relationship will have many beautiful and funny moments.<br/><br/>The main issue with the movie is the ending: after many wonderfully conceived scenes, with the perfect mix between CGI and stunts actions, the movie finishes with the classic boss fight, that we are already used to see in a Marvel movie and that was, personally speaking, completely unsettling. I was waiting for something different, but in the end director decided to play safe. After watching Shazam!, I think that the DC Extended Universe has a lot of potential, but as we already know through the years, it had many difficulties to rise, Marvel has definitely more experience, but it tends to create always those empty and repetitive movies, while DC, at least for me, has more beautiful stories. They just need to understand how to develop something that really differs and I think that with Joker (2019), they are finally going in the right direction."

She accidentally meets a human male during the WW1 conflict and wants to help humanity in their time of need. All the while keeping watch for any god-like villains that would threaten the Earth and it's inhabitants.<br/><br/>*Special Stars- Gal Gadot, Chris Prine.<br/><br/>*Theme- To help in making the world a better place and peaceful, people need to be active in societies' workings.<br/><br/>*Trivia/location/goofs- Gal Gadot trained for nine months to gain seventeen pounds of pure muscle. The scenes of Themyscira were shot in Southern Italy, on the Amalfi Coast. Production designer Aline Bonetto said the location was perfect: ""Italy had beautiful weather, a beautiful blue-green sea, not too much tide, not too much wave."" In Greco-Roman mythology, the Amazons of Themyscira and the Greek hero Heracles share a rivalry, since Heracles seduced Queen Hippolyta and stole her enchanted belt. This carried over into both DC and Marvel comics. In the DC Comics, Hercules (who is the Roman version of the Greek Heracles) is a misogynistic and villainous character who was punished by the Amazons for defiling them; he later became an anti-hero who sought redemption for his actions. Some of the Amazons have flesh colored cloth over one side of their chest, almost seeming like one breast was uncovered or nonexistent (this is very apparent in the opening sequence when young Diana watches the training and Antiope walks over to talk with an Amazon so clad). This may be a reference to the fact that Amazons are often depicted in art as having one breast exposed. Ancient sources even state that Amazons cut or burned off their breast on their dominant side so that it wouldn't interfere with combat, especially with a bow. Some ancient sources suggest that this is the source of their name; ""a-mazos"" in Greek means ""without breast"".<br/><br/>
*Emotion- A wonderfully produced, casted, and performed film with a interesting plot that covers mythology and history in major doses. Very enjoyable and Gal Gadot is wonderful in this film as this character.<br/><br/>*Based On- D.C. comics and character."

","Wonder Woman is fun and action packed, Gal Gadot's inexperience hurts the character less than I thought it would, which I credit to director Patty Jenkins. As with most comic book movies the villain is underutilized and kinda boring, but the good supporting characters help to forgive the movie for the underwhelming villain. Overall Wonder Woman is a good origin story for a character I hope to see a lot more of on the big screen."
"li-90413","9","1","1","14 December 2018"," Personal Thought x5 over-watch
","I like this movie.I do recommend it. Some people say it's good. Some of them say it's bad. It's okay. It's only their opinion, not yours. You won't know how good it is if you don't watch it.<br/><br/>Some people like the action scene. Some likes the CGI. Some likes the plot. Some likes the emotion and act of the actors. Personally I like the plot a lot.
Some people say that Gal Gadots (Wonder-woman) acted very poor. Well I think every actors acted just fine. Wonder-woman came from a world that is isolated from our world. She had so little experience of our world that makes her so naive to think that humanity is good, but the pro is that she's kind, generous and believes in love. In fact, we're not either good or bad(personal believe as well). Human could so easily be manipulated too, such as advertisement, propaganda and school, etc. We are not like gods who born with special skills but that made us gifted with unlimited possibility. Being a so call bad guy is part of it as well. It is like a new born baby learning from falling. Humanity, as a whole, acts like a baby. We learn from our mistakes, and we solve problems. Moreover, How do we know good if there isn't any bad existed. We evaluate something that is good because there is a standard. There exists something in comparison. If you ever have to say that the god gave us a gift, then that would be our mind. It gives us an ability to make choice, and our feelings are just assisting our choice making.<br/><br/>illogical? That just happened in a 1: 130,000,000,000 ratio. There are 7 billion people in the world today, over 200 billion people ever lived in the history of humankind and each one of them behaved differently. How does anyone possibly knowing what logic there is. Sometimes, when you heard someone make a choice and you think that option is very bad choice, illogical, and stupid. but that's just how they reacted in a blink of a second. How do people think when they drink and drive? How do people think when they play with fire(arm)? right? Sometimes, your logic is not another person's logic and our logic does not 100% match reality either. So don't over think about the logic.<br/><br/>I like Steve Trevor, the character in the film. He knew absolutely what he could do and what he couldn't do as a human being and he had always tried his best to do whatever he was capable of. He understood what was more important and he spent 5 seconds to make the choice to sacrifice himself to save the day. I know these people are really out there and I do understand how hard the choice is, that's why their act always touches me. The 5 second close-up shot of Steve Trevor on the plane gave me 2 hours thought of philosophy. $13, worth it. Sometimes, you might think ""oh, I can do that too"" or ""I would do that too"". You have no idea until things happen in front of you. It's logical when you think of it and it's illogical when someone actually do it. I think only the people who know how fragile they are could ever be strong and Legendary. Just something to think of after watching the movie. ""I wish we had more time,"" said Steve Trevor.<br/><br/>I wish our society can look into what these films are offering us more often, but not just the fights, the guns and the CGI."

I liked the movie.<br/><br/>Diana ""Prince"" is an Amazon, a form of humans that were preserved by the gods to protect the rest of the human race from the God of War, Ares, who seeks to corrupt them. They were given a weapon from the gods that Diana calls a god killer. Little does Diana know, she's the god killer. Only a god can kill a god. Diana's mother doesn't approve of her going to the real world especially because she'd be going with a man. The Amazons are women only. Most of them have never seen a man before Diana saves Steve when he's shot out of the sky and falls into their ocean.<br/><br/>Diana goes to the real world with Steve and they attempt to kill Ares and stop World War I. the majority of the movie consists of Steve trying to explain to Diana the way humans think and why they do the things they do. Whe Diana kills who she believes is Ares and the war doesn't stop, she yells at Steve and his response is, ""Maybe Ares or no Ares, that's who we are."" Diana gets even more upset with him and basically tells him to leave her alone. So, he leaves her alone and tries to stop the Mustard gas from being delivered to the Germans in the trenches. Mustard gas had just been invented and was to be used to win the war. Then Diana meets the real Ares. he taunts Diana and tries to get her to join him. Her mother had told her before she left that the humans didn't deserve her. Diana repeats this to Ares and hs response is, ""She's right. They don't deserve our help, they only deserve destruction."" Who does Ares think he is? Anyway the have a giant fight. Diana gets knocked across the compound. Steve comes to her rescue, professes his love and leaves to make the airplane explode. Killing himself in the process. Because that was smart. When Diana sees the plane explode, the anger she felt towards Ares gives her the strength to defeat him and she goes back to London to work forever without her love. What the crap?!"

","If you are looking for a movie accurately describing the events of World War 1 then this is not it. It is an amazingly good action film but is not very historically accurate. I'm not sure why we are watching this in a history through film class but i'm not complaining. Although the movie does not portray the events it gives great lessons about war and the temptations of mankind. The action scenes throughout the movie are thrilling and fast paced. I really enjoyed the scene where Wonder Woman is battling Ares and when she is rushing across no man's land deflecting all the bullets with her wrists. The special effects in the movie were also amazingly realistic. I was very intrigued by the effects they used for the island that was separated from the rest of the world."

","In a top-secret roller derby camp, beauty pageant contestant Diana, daughter of Yahweh, is training to become a Massod agent, when ""above averagely"" endowed Captain Kirk arrives after his starship, is shot down by World War I Nazis. Diana and her team defeat a crew of German sailors who are hunting Kirk just for the sport of it, and she then accompanies Kirk to London, where they form a special- forces diversity unit, comprised of Shane MacGowspud, Sammy Davis Berber, and Chief Spiritual Credibility. The new unit goes to the front, where they hope to destroy the totally evil Martin Bormann and Dr. Doom, phantomess of the opera; the two are engaged in random bouts of sublimated nookie while they develop the kinds of weapons of mass destruction usually monopolized by Arab leaders like Saddam Hussein and Bashar Al-Assad. Diana is convinced that Bormann is really Lucifer, the first in a long line of Yahweh's prodigal sons, and she believes that if she can destroy him, she can help to impart a new dispensation based on John Lennon's ""Imagine."" It turns out that Bormann is not Lucifer; instead, the Prince of Darkness is a member of the British aristocracy disguised as a member of the British upper-middle class. Diana defeats him but learns that he has impregnated ""mankind"" with the evil seed, though she believes that man can remain good, despite what she's learned from Genesis and despite Lucifer's bad genes. Meanwhile, Kirk proves that, even though he has blue eyes, he is Christ and sacrifices himself for the sins of humanity, but in an act of ultimate Christian humility, he conceals his divinity, since he refuses to go to the mountain for a transfiguration. In the end, good triumphs over evil, and Diana gets a job at the Louvre where she receives love letters and sexy photographs from mysterious billionaire Donald Trump."

"gcsman","9","7","18","13 June 2017"," ""Goodbye, brother""
","This isn't a perfect film (what is??), but the reviews and audience reactions from all age groups and both genders already say this is a landmark cinema event. This is a fully fledged female-superhero movie, period. Is WW really going to be the sea-change in the superhero genre that has been WAY too long in coming? We'll see. But either way, all other female superhero films are going to be compared to this one. <br/><br/>Even more, this film has changed my view of what superhero movies can be. It's right at the top of the list in terms of emotional connections with the characters and feeling that things somehow MATTER. I haven't felt that way coming out of this kind of movie since X-Men United (2003).<br/><br/>Going beyond that, WW might also save the whole DCEU franchise by turning away from the glum, violent, angst-ridden 'style' of Zack Synder's Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. That approach admittedly suits Batman pretty well, but absolutely not for Superman and not for Wonder Woman. Brava, Patty Jenkins.<br/><br/>Earlier female superhero movies including Supergirl (1984), Catwoman (2004), Elektra (2005) suffered from poor scripts and poor budgets. Good intentions aren't enough. (Another one that's actually pretty decent is Aeon Flux (2005) starring Charlize Theron. Before the casting of WW was announced, Theron would have been my instinctive choice for the role given her commanding physical presence and action-film cred that also includes Hancock, Mad Max Fury Road, and Atomic Blonde.) <br/><br/>But Gal Gadot turns out to be great. I've seen this 4 times, and every time I've come away more impressed with her. Going in the first time around I expected she'd turn in just a steady 'OK' type of performance -- but she was a LOT better than OK. She has the necessary athleticism, she inhabits WW from the inside out, and she delivers her lines with absolute conviction. She *is* Diana so thoroughly that now you can't imagine anyone else doing it. Casting Gal Gadot might be the best thing Zack Snyder will ever do for the DCEU.<br/><br/>And the No Man's Land sequence! It's the central pivot on which the entire movie turns, because (as Patty Jenkins said) it's where Diana becomes Wonder Woman. I haven't felt a deep-seated thrill like this from a movie scene since the finale of X2, or the Lord of the Rings classics (remember the signal fires on the mountaintops from ROTK? Or the opening of The Two Towers? Like that.). But also huge credit to Rupert Gregson Williams' music: instead of something hard and jittery, he composes majestic, measured, deeply emotional music that is all the more effective to accompany the heroism on screen -- which not coincidentally, reminded me of Howard Shore's music for LOTR. I hope his luminous score gets an Oscar nom.<br/><br/>Diana of Themiscyra, as Wonder Woman, is heroic, but oddly, she is never courageous (!). That's because one of Diana's defining characteristics is that she's fearless, and without fear you don't need courage. She has an utterly clear mission in her mind and simply tackles everything head-on without letting anyone or anything stand in her way. (After all, why should she follow the lead of any of the men fighting this endless war? She's an Amazon, and Amazonian royalty to boot.) Another surprising treat is Gadot's thousand-watt smile, which we never got to see in the humorless BvS. and boy can she fight! The action sequences are among the best in this whole genre. <br/><br/>I loved the two scenes that framed Diana's time with Steve (which I haven't seen anyone else mention). On their first meeting, having saved him from drowning, she reaches toward his face with a flickering smile while curiosity and delight run across her face. The last time, looking at his photo in Trafalgar Square, she again reaches gently toward his picture while grief, memory, and (again) a flickering smile cross her face. Lovely.<br/><br/>My favorite line in the whole film is the very last one spoken, and it comes just before Diana blasts Ares to pieces: ""Goodbye, brother"". It shows that (a) she has finally come to terms with her full identity and power, and (b) she is now the only Greek god left on Earth.<br/><br/>Among lots of positives in this movie, two things that didn't really work for me were the sidekicks who tag along with Diana and Steve (although I was more OK with them on the second viewing), and the evil/mad chemist Dr. Maru (her character never got filled out and just felt odd).<br/><br/>Bottom line? I'm with the young kids who think Wonder Woman is awesome. Hope, idealism, and love do not go out of style. I can't wait to see WW in Justice League, and in her own sequel!"
"kynick2","6","7","18","6 June 2017"," Underwhelmed but entertaining.
","I know I'm probably in the minority but for me Wonder Woman was not all that. Let me start with the good. 1. Gal is FINE! 2. The fight scenes were pretty cool. 3. It had a decent villain. 4. Gal is FINE! Now the bad.<br/><br/>1. I felt NOTHING. With Logan I felt something. I was connected With Ant Man I felt something (Joy) In Wonder woman, I cared so little about every character that no sooner than I left theater the film didn't register. This was the biggest one for me.<br/><br/>2. I didn't know the origin story but by the time Diana left the island without being ""told the truth"" I figured the sword wasn't't that big of a deal. It was also pretty obvious that the guy they wanted us to think was Ares...wasn't't. I was however surprised by who he turned out to be.<br/><br/>3. The only thing more irksome that Robin Wright Penn's accent was the contrived romantic and comedic elements. A few examples...""What's that?"" ""Oh, it's a watch"" #CRICKETS The whole sleep with each other thing on the boat...#AWKWARD <br/><br/>4. The numerous things that made no sense. Exhibit A) Is it me or did it feel like the sole purpose of Steve's suicide mission was to serve as a catalyst for WW to get mad? Was there really no other way of disposing of the bombs? Exhibit B) It was established that gas masks were useless. I guess the British speaking German bad guys didn't get the message. Exhibit C) Since its creation, no one has ever stumbled across their island? There are a ton more nonsensical things that could have been put together tighter.<br/><br/>5. Continuity errors are common in films but how glaring was it when within a matter of seconds it went from daylight to pitch black? Think, motorcycle chase in Dark Knight Rises.<br/><br/>I would have liked...back story on The chemist or anyone. It would have been cool to see more of the Gods...maybe I missed a few things, I dozed off no fewer than 3 times. Is this better than B V S? Yeah. Is it the best DC film so far. Maybe, but it does not approach Dark Knight greatness.<br/><br/>SCORE 6.5/10"

","Wonder Woman was a fantastic movie. The underlying theme that ""absolute good"" and ""absolute evil"" don't exist was beautifully weaved into a movie that had to be a little over commercialized in order to succeed. Speaking of things that had to be kept in order to please the masses, I love that the creators knew the original sexy costume (created by a man to sell comic books) had to be kept, but changed it so that Diana created & took complete ownership of it. It was her outfit to choose, not anyone else's to force on her. That coupled with the hilarious scenes showing the hypocritical over-sexualization of women/the Virgin Mary complex that society pushes made it one of the best super hero movies I've seen. Congrats to all involved including Patty Jenkins, the director, you made a character little girls will look up to for years to come. I can't wait for the future of cinema and all the progressive women and men involved."
"pivguy","5","7","18","4 June 2017"," Very Mediocre If I Do Say So Myself
","Wonder Woman is not a terrible film. There are very noticeable qualities in this film. The two main characters, Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor, are very likable, their acting is so good, and they have a well written romance. Some of the visuals are nice to look at such as the island of Themyscira. The film also offers really good messages like how humans in general are messed up and stuff. <br/><br/>Unfortunately that's where the positive stuff ends. Everyone besides the two main characters and the two or three characters that were okay, are so incompetent, it makes my head hurt. The villains are very weak, probably the 2nd weakest villains of the DCEU so far, and that's saying a lot. The CGI, action scenes, cinematography, and score/music ranges from terrible to passable. And that ending....If it weren't for that ending, I would've given this film a 6 or 6.5, but that ending killed the film. <br/><br/>So in the ending, it's Wonder Woman's character being destroyed by fighting Aries in the most mindless way possible. They had a very wonderfully written, well executed message and shat on it. The reason for Steve Trevor's death, my favorite character in the film, was so unreal and forced, I wanted to scream in the theater. But I guess Wonder Woman, so far, is the best or least bad DCEU movie. It's a 4.5/10 but I didn't hate it as much as Suicide Squad or Batman vs Superman."
"onionbagel","5","7","18","4 June 2017"," A pathetic copy of both Captain America AND Thor!?
","I have recently joked that I am ""switching to 'Team DC' due to all the politically correct BS in Marvel's comics that is slowly creeping into their movies (changing characters' gender, sexual orientation, etc.); in all seriousness, I do think DC movies tend to have better stories than Marvel movies...until now! The story-line of Wonder Woman seems like nothing more than a blend of Captain America (1) and Thor (1); Diana comes from a world of gods, journeys to civilization on Earth (Thor), at a time when we at currently at war (Captain America). The resemblances DON'T stop there though. If you recall the ending of Captain America: Steve crashes the ship in the ice to save others while on the phone with Peggy (all-the-while looking at a picture of her); in Wonder Woman, Steve (Chris Pine) blows up a plane to stop a deadly chemical warfare gas from being unleashed, and Diana/Wonder Woman looks at his picture at the war memorial afterwards...seems familiar??? <br/><br/>Also, if you've seen Daredevil and Elektra, you'd probably agree that Elektra's brief part in DD was better than her ENTIRE solo film; i feel the same about Wonder Woman's part in Batman V Superman (compared to her own movie).<br/><br/>Lastly, as a lot of people said about Deadpool, I felt that Wonder Woman (the movie in general, not WW herself) tried TOO hard to be funny at times.<br/><br/>If it wasn't a copy, I'd probably give it a 6/10 (passing by college standards); it wasn't anything new (an origin story), it was slow (but most DC movies seem so the first time around; I'd have probably changed my review later like I did with BVS, and not nearly as good a story as something like BVS.<br/><br/>All in all, I set my expectations high with ALL DC movies, and this one fell short."
"JoshuaDysart","5","7","18","3 June 2017"," I didn't like it, but that's not what's important
","Wonder Woman is a sincere film. Its heart is in the right place. It's thematically bang on. It's important. I'm very glad it exists. I'm glad it's being universally praised. It has some fantastic costume work in it and some strong production design. It is, indeed, better than recent previous attempts at bringing DC characters to the big screen (but then the bar has been set pretty low). I see little girls dressing as the protagonist and it makes my heart sing. I see comic book stores hosting Wonder Woman Day, I see the world falling in love with a character that I've always adored. These are all wonderful things. <br/><br/>I was very excited for this flick. When the reviews were coming in strong, I let my hopes get high. I admit that I actively ignored my Rotten Tomatoes rule of thumb (any movie with more than 90% RT rating has a huge probability of sucking).<br/><br/>But the film is, subjectively, pretty bad.<br/><br/>It is overwrought. It is written as if by algorithm, meaning that it is simply an amalgamation of standard scenes you've seen before in other movies, just reskinned for this world and this character, everyone acts out every scene in extremely predictable ways. Its third act fight scene is extremely problematic and boring. It is inconsistent, Wonder Woman's presence and powers fluctuate so wildly that she can fight and kill a god, but not a handful of German's with WW I era rifles on a beach? <br/><br/>The CGI is criminally bad, the physics in the special effects shots are so off that it seems like I'm watching a last gen video game.<br/><br/>Its dialogue has exactly three modes: exposition, clumsy attempts at humor, and stating out loud the thematic intent of the scene.<br/><br/>Its fight scenes are more often excuses to pose the character than acts of complex, readable staging, particularly the awful final fight. The use of slow motion in the fight scenes is so reliable and consistent that it seems like a parody of Zach Snyder's already completely unengaged video game fight choreography.<br/><br/>The villains mean nothing. They are uninspired, dreary, and underutilized. Apart from seeing the very well visualized Themyscira, and the handful of times we get to see Wonder Woman in action, there is very little fun to be had in this movie. There is almost nothing that feels inventive and most of the film is colored in that same drab, dreary way that all of the recent DC films are colored.<br/><br/>The movie is looooong, with a running time that used to be reserved for movies like The Piano, The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now, films with sprawling cinematic, thematic, and emotive ambitions that this does not even begin to have.<br/><br/>Lastly, I can't tell if Gadot is incapable of acting or if the script gave her so little of substance to work with that she did an amazing job just keeping it all together.<br/><br/>I have to ask why? Why does the DC universe so actively avoid fun, immersive, well crafted, and inventive storytelling? Why do they double down on this faux-epic, dismal pap? Why are they so afraid of color? Of bold comic-book like choices? <br/><br/>Personally, I wish I had watched a little bit of Wonder Woman on cable and then turned it off like I have every other recent DC movie, but maybe voting with my dollar at least helped change the backward ass notion that women can't open big budget movies.<br/><br/>Oh, well. As I said, the most important thing is that this movie exists, that people like it and that the character is back in the spotlight. That's all that matters. My opinion certainly doesn't. This wasn't a soulless or intellectually bankrupt film like the other DC movies have been, it was just bad, but maybe bad is good enough."

Well, here's an idea Zeus, since you're the god of gods, why not take away your little boys toys. Aries, you are now demoted to gardener. Grow some flowers. No, Mr. Zeus let's Aries corrupt man. Wasn't that Satan's job? Since man is now waging wars, Mr Zeus creates the Amazons to help man, and with his last powers stops Aries, before dying. Nonsense. Was that in the comic books? If it was, then stupid is, what stupid is.<br/><br/>WWI, Dr. Plastic Ugly Face creates a deadly poison with the help of Evil German General who may be wearing WWII uniform. Captain Kirk steals the formula and single handedly destroys the German compound. Great stuff right. No! The Germans chase Kirk to Amazon Island and the Amazon/German battle. All the Germans are dead. A bunch of Amazons are dead. This is one of the stupidest battle scenes I have ever seen. Wonder W's life is saved by her teacher. Watch this scene again in slow mo. It's confusing. Bad cinematography. All we see is the Teacher saying something like ""No"", then a blur, bullet, and she's dead. Maybe someone should hire a real cinematographer.<br/><br/>Now, take a look at Amazon island, and the surrounding water. Is this movie a cartoon? Because that is what we have here! A Cartoon!<br/><br/>After reviewing Star Wars, VII, The Farce Awakens for more than a year before IMDB went south, and now I cannot read the new user reviews in chronological order, I have learned a lot about films, societies gullible consumption of the film and society production. Here's the deal: Farce is a lie. It copied and pasted, garbage cgi fx, quick edit, garbage story, garbage acting. Build it and they will come. That is the philosophy of the film industry. Like all industries. It's about money. If they can't sell tickets they will stop producing. The story in Farce is garbage. The story in Wonder Woman is garbage. It was probably taken literately from the comic books. It's a joke. The acting is crap. Any serious actor would probably cash in on being in the film, but will probably never watch their own performance. Anybody want to come out and say that Gal Gadot is a serious actress. She's definitely a pretty woman. Maybe that's what they should have named the movie. But she is not an actress. Captain Kirk did a fine job for what he was given. All the other so called actors were just there to read their lines. All the Amazon ladies, just plain joke actors. Nothing face.<br/><br/>
So, you want to love this movie because it's about women's empowerment. Great. As a symbol of that you may have a point. But if you take a look at the movie objectively, without prejudice or per-conceived idea of what you want it to be, then you will see it for the garbage fill that it is. It all starts with the story.

","This is one of those movies that made me want never again to trust or even read what the ""professional"" critics have to say, particularly after I encouraged a few friends (or so they were before seeing the film), to see it with me.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot may be pretty and someone to watch out for on a battlefield, but she's not very impressive as an actor, particularly when viewed in the company of other more experienced players such as Chris Pine and Robin Wright. You can take the better episodes of Lynda Carter's 1970s TV series or just about any of 2015's Agent Carter (with Hayley Atwell), and you'll find more impressive acting and a touch of humour as well.<br/><br/>I enjoy good superhero movies and admittedly I don't expect the writing and story twists employed in this genre to be stellar; however, even a Gail Gadot with super acting powers couldn't save this one. The back story at the start of the film is passably interesting, but then the story just degenerates into good guys versus Nazis, which ""has been done"" more than a few times already. The writing, such as it is, is flat and the overuse of CGI makes the film appear even worse. The end (guess who wins) was a relief."

Anybody with any intelligence and understanding of the character will find this ""movie"" a hard crack upside their head with a baseball bat by DC and WB!<br/><br/>Lynda Carters Wonder Woman may have been cheese-tastic, but at least she held the traits of what and who Wonder Woman is, even though they got convoluted by season 3. And on top of that, she was pretty much THE iconic Wonder Woman. <br/><br/>This little hobbit of a woman, pretending to be an Amazon, much less Wonder Woman is just laughable beyond being a sick joke. Sure there were a LOT of holes and problems with the movie, but the REAL horror of this movie was the casting! OMG! What is with that horrific accent?! She looks like a 12 year old girl trying on mommies clothes, trying to act like a grown woman. A hysterical laugh riot in itself!<br/><br/>Wonder Girl she could have been, but she is NOT and NEVER will be Wonder WOMAN! <br/><br/>And what is with Chris Pine trying to be Steve Trevor? Yet another shortie put in the role of a tall, masculine, soldier character. WHY are these tiny, short people put into these rolls of BIG, TALL, STATUESQUE characters?????? It's like watching a one of the Justice League episodes where they get changed into 10 year olds!<br/><br/>And don't get me started on that soundtrack! I really don't know what to say about that horrible sound....there just are no words for it. The only thing that comes to mind is that sound you hear when garbage is flushed down a pipe. Which I guess DOES fit the movie then.<br/><br/>Marvel apparently has the brains and intelligence to hire the RIGHT people to make their movies, as the people they pick for their superheroes are excellent choices. Those actors fit their characters perfectly. DC on the other hand.......apparently they have a monkey throwing darts at magazines, in order to pick ""actors"" for some of these roles. <br/><br/>Yes, sometimes DC does get it right, but 90% of the time, they don't. Christopher Reeve, Lynda Carter, Michael Keaton, even Jason Mamoa as Aquaman was brilliant. Hell, I'd even go so far as to say Ben Affleck as Batman is a much better choice that Cavill as Stouperman and Gadot as Wretched Woman.<br/><br/>But, as I've read in other reviews also........it seems that this ""movie"" was fed to a Wonder Woman fan base and a feminist fan base that has been teased and starved so long, they just gobbled up what garbage that was fed to them.<br/><br/>I mean, look at the YEARS and YEARS and YEARS of TEASING, with movies that were constantly shelved, a TV show that was shelved halfway through the first episode, and false promises of other Wonder Woman related media that never came to be.<br/><br/>I mean really......we are literally DROWNING in Batman propaganda, movies, TV shows, anime, animation, shorts, etc.... But hardly ANYTHING on Wonder Woman!<br/><br/>Maybe one day all these people will wake up and see what has happened. Hollywood feeding us garbage and passing it off as something spectacular, only because we've been teased for SO many years!!!<br/><br/>Too bad I don't have the money to make a Wonder Woman movie the RIGHT way. It would be nice if DC would listen to their fans the way Marvel listens to theirs! But I guess that will never happen. So more DC fans keep jumping the fence to Marvel.<br/><br/>What a shame."

Great character with a great personality.<br/><br/>Dc at the end makes a good film. I without exaggeration i left vomiting of the hundred, after seeing Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad.

Wonder Woman has a well managed story, screenplay, casting and more importantly no ruining moments like the Martha scene from Batman vs Superman. The movie was so good that at some point you get to think that the whole story of Ares was just a myth and would be thinking what would happen next as wonder woman lost her belief on the humans. And then comes the god of war. The whole action sequence was so damn good and the end where she gets to remember Steve's words. Those words were fab. Gal Gadot answers to everyone by her action & glamour, who initially thought she would be a bad choice for Wonder Woman. Chris pine was so good, he made justice to Steve's role.

","This is one DC Comic movie I really enjoyed. I remembered the 1974 early movie starring Cathy Lee Crosby. That one was disappointing because they had a blonde Wonder Woman. The TV series starring Lynda Carter is legend in its own right. This version starring Gal Gadot puts the ""A"" in action! It goes back into the Origin of the famed Amazing Amazon. Through the rough and rugged training she received as a young girl, Princess Diana(Gadot). After her training, a pilot enters the island of Themyscira which man is forbidden. He does help the Amazon community fight the Germans. And it was tough for Diana's mother to accept her decision to fight against the Germans. When she goes to London, she and Steve Trevor(Chris Pine) infiltrate and go to stop the enemy from dispersing a powerful version of mustard gas. To the world, she is known as Wonder Woman, and is one fine warrior to everyone's eyes. The high octane action in the film is remarkable. Gal Gadot has a slight resemblance to Lynda Carter. I liked how she handles herself against the Germans and against Ares. I enjoyed the movie very much. I think it is one of the best DC Comics films ever made. Recommended for all the women and girls. Like Supergirl, this Wonder Woman is a must see! Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars!"
"Kingslaay","Null","6","15","13 June 2017"," Wonder Woman hits it out of the park
","Wonder Woman was an exceptional film that highly exceeded expectations. From story line to acting and directing this film was perfectly executed. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine give stellar performances in this entertaining film. <br/><br/>At the outset we see a world of gods and legend that coincides with the world we know. The film beautifully merges these two worlds in a way that makes it realistic and plausible. The story of Aries and his existence is well woven in the film and it pulls off a nice twist that explains him being the dark force behind war. Gal Gadot is excellent as Wonder Woman and brings back to life a heroine that has been absent for some time and buried under numerous superhero films. This film has its moments and does a marvelous job in living up to those moments accompanied by the right music. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine did an excellent job in bringing these moments to life. Thankfully an unnecessary and fully fledged romance was not used. It is as if Wonder Women exists firmly in its own universe and nicely executes its story without too much attention to other films or even a franchise, it exists in its own right. Perhaps that is a successful strategy in making films that are part of a series.<br/><br/>When this film was first announced I was unsure about how it would perform. Batman vs Superman was a disappointment for many fans. We also had Wonder Woman in this film who seemed mysterious and possessed powers and tools most were unfamiliar with. Her fighting scenes left many asking how questions. This film explains this somewhat forgotten heroine with clarity. It is easily the most successful installment in the DC franchise. Thankfully Zac Synder was not the director and it shows because this was a very well made film. He should be prevented from making others and other directors should take the lead. <br/><br/>Overall Wonder Woman has the right amount of intrigue, depth and uniqueness to make it a memorable superhero film. It should very well go down as one of the best Superhero films made in recent times.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","Superhero movies always find their way to the Indian theaters. I have watched the Avengers, Winter Soldier and Civil War. Last year my friend had gone to Batman vs Superman without inviting me and I was so glad! This year I was expecting Wonder Woman to fail miserably. But as the movie opened critics started pouring positive reviews. So I decided to take my friend to Wonder Woman and it easily became my favorite Superhero movie (The Dark Knight series not considered). I would say it is slightly better than Winter Soldier which is my favorite MCU movie.<br/><br/>The reason is simple. Unlike normal movies which focus on elevating and glorifying the character of the Superhero, Wonder Woman takes the audience and herself along a journey that eventually leads to her self-realization. The film has a smooth flow compared to other Superhero movies and the acting is brilliant. The concept of Gods and Humans, was in my opinion properly defined in this movie. As a lover of Greek mythology I understood the charterers Diana and Ares. Except the last action packed CGI battle of Wonder Woman and Ares, this film is perfect. Another reason that Wonder Woman differentiates itself from other movies is because of its emotion packed story. There is so much to laugh, so much to be excited and so much to be sad. As I walked out of the theater I have to say I was so content!<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie not just to MCU or DC or superhero fans but to all movie lover because it's not just a good superhero movie, it's a good movie."
"theokat","10","6","15","12 June 2017"," Epic fighting, good background story and narrative in general, a few cringy moments but overall very good (contains spoilers)
","I was really concerned about the DCU after I saw the ridiculous plot drive in Batman vs. Superman and the clichés used in Suicide Squad as well as their chaotic construction of the narrative (a really poor job on the director's behalf) which ruined both films for me. Fortunately, it seems that director Patty Jenkins had more sense than directors Zack Snider and David Ayer as the film is so well constructed that not only do you feel immersed in the story but you are allowed time to actually know most of the characters and develop a connection (Antiope, Sameer, Charlie or The Chief). Thus when one of these characters meets an unfortunate end, you actually feel something for said character. <br/><br/>Elena Anaya does an amazing job in her performance as Dr. Maru, Chris Pine is perfect for the role of Steve Trevor and Gal Godot of course shines as Wonder Woman. A round of applause should also go to the two amazing actresses who portray Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and Antiope (Robin Wringht). Overall the movie saved the DCU and stole Marvel's thunder (finally!).<br/><br/>On the down side, there are a few cringy moments right around the end after Steve takes off to save the day and Diana reveals that she is fighting for love (a good message but it could have been portrayed better) as well as the villain reveal. I mean come on! Lupin from Harry Potter? I just can't see that guy being Ares. He's a very good British actor but David Thewlis just didn't seem right for the part if you ask me. <br/><br/>All in all, the movie is good, awesome job Patty Jenkins for this lovely DCU representation."
"ryandannar","8","6","15","11 June 2017"," Just a darn good superhero flick.
","I liked ""Wonder Woman"" a whole lot. Not only is it a ""fun"" movie -- but it's also a ""good"" one, with solid writing and character-development to match the larger-than-life heroics.<br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the lengthy prologue, which introduces Diana and her Amazonian family on their home island, a faux-Grecian paradise which is hidden away from the rest of the world behind a kind of supernatural cloaking-device. The film takes its time with these early scenes, revealing the nature of Diana's upbringing and the reasons for her simplistic but naive goodheartedness. <br/><br/>These scenes are also beautiful, depicting a paradise that looks remarkably real, without excessive CGI work. I was reminded, in a way, of the old Greek-themed adventure films, such as Hercules, Jason and the Argonauts, and Clash of the Titans. There's an on-location quality to the island scenes in ""Wonder Woman"" that does more to establish a sense of reality than even the best CGI can muster.<br/><br/>And then the film becomes a WWI espionage adventure, as Diana finds herself drawn into the world of mortals to try and stop a kind of violence she doesn't fully understand. I was entertained by the colorful cast of characters, as well as by the film's charmingly earnest sensibility. This is easily the most downright ""earnest"" superhero film since Marvel's original ""Captain America,"" and I think it's a better film to boot. Diana's strong-but-naive persona brings out the finer qualities in Steve Trevor, the British spy with whom her life has become entangled, and they have a chemistry that's a lot of fun to watch. <br/><br/>Like most superhero films, ""Wonder Woman"" had a few too many action- climaxes for my taste, some fairly gaping plot-holes -- (For starters, what happened to that battleship off the coast of the island, which looms ominously before the film totally forgets about it?) -- and the final act is a bit messy. I also thought, for all the talk about the film's Feminist narrative -- well, I'll just say that whatever Feminist narrative it offers is fairly superficial, contained almost entirely in the fact that the film's protagonist is a strong woman who doesn't require a man to save her. <br/><br/>But perhaps that's all fine enough. Ultimately, I just wanted a good, fun movie, and ""Wonder Woman"" delivered a better time than I had expected. It does a great job of establishing its world and characters, and it tells its story in a satisfying, fun, and emotionally meaningful way. In its best moments, it even achieves a kind of wholesome, humorous, iconic quality that I don't believe we've seen on screen since Richard Donner's original ""Superman."" So yes, I am comparing it unironically to that classic of the genre. One might consider the two films as equals."
"diegopp-51779","8","6","15","10 June 2017"," Wonderful (pun intended), but not great
","I must first say I am very glad this film turned out to be so good. I thought it was going to be terrible like previous DCEU movies, but I was very glad when I saw that it was far from that. ""Wonder Woman"" is a fantastic film with some fantastic moments... Nevertheless, it's not flawless.<br/><br/>Acting is fantastic. The role of Diana fits Gal Gadot perfectly and the rest of the cast is also very good. Even people who aren't given much screen time (Robin Wright, Connie Nielsen, Lucy Davis) shine in their roles. Patty Jenkins directs the movie marvelously; all elements seem in the right balance and, unlike previous DCEU films, this one doesn't favor style over substance: It keeps both in just the right amount. The editing is fantastic. Visual effects are enjoyable, though not great. Costumes are incredible (particularly Wonder Woman's, needless to say). The score is brilliant... Almost everything is good.<br/><br/>Keyword: Almost. I have only two problems with this film: One is that it has some moments that feel too far-fetched, even considering the rules of this fictional world. You see those moments and go ""Oh, come on, that can't happen"". The other problem and the one that bothered me the most is that the film is a little too formulaic. It's just another superhero origin story. At least Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, as awful as they were, had something in their favor: Originality. The concepts were unlike anything we'd seen before. ""Wonder Woman"" decides not to take that risk and to stick to your normal superhero origin story recipe: An unwilling hero unaware of her true powers, a love story, an unexpected villain, the hero learning to live with her abilities... Nothing new.<br/><br/>In the end of the day, even though ""Wonder Woman"" isn't great, it certainly is a fantastic and enjoyable experience, one that gives me faith that the DCEU is not doomed like we thought it was."
"tankace","9","6","15","10 June 2017"," I was waiting for this film in years and it paid off!!
","Wonder Woman is one of the most iconic character from the comics and also one of the oldest ,been in adventures ever since 1940. To add to that, it was irritating to many, myself included, that from the trio of the Trinity of the Justice League ,Batman and Superman had already dozens of films and series dedicated to them ,but perhaps the most famous super-heroine in history lacked the same level of screen time ,until now!<br/><br/>To the film itself, is the origins story of Diana for Themyscira to the trenches of the First World War, as she goes in order to end it as soon as possible. Accompanied her is Steve Roger eh Trevor who acts both as her guide and tutor for the world outside the domain of the Amazons. To the Princess of Themyscira herself Gal Gadot was excellent in her role not just playing but been this Amazon ,strong ,decisive, ready for fight at any time ,but at the same time showing how outside of the world she is, but always willing to learn new things for it ,from the nationalities to dancing(!). Chris Pine after finishing traveling around in the Enterprise, was the right mix of comedy and sidekick to Diana ,more or less reacting in a normal manner to these ex-ordinary events. To his credit ,we don't crash land in a island full of Amazons using swords, bows and arrows and wearing tunics everyday. And the support crew played their part and delivered with great quotes and well placed action and comedic wits!<br/><br/>To the crew I glad that the men in the film weren't all of the douses (with the team of Trevor been the best example) ,unlike with previous women leading films. As for the actions ,godness was directed excellently and at any time I understood were each character was or what was doing. Over all what we want from Man of Steel ,Batman vs Superman and Suiside Squad ,it was fulfilled here. Ah and color ,a lot of color, made the watching so much more entertaining! <br/><br/>And as for the setting ,I was worried how a 100% good character would be in a war in which wasn't any good or bad ,only gray and mud and morally questionable tactics. But my fears were subdued as the director's team find the solution and worked out in the end. <br/><br/>However I have to say I have some nit-pitch. Firstly it seems to have ""borrowed"" plot elements from Captain America the First Avenger, just saying. Some clichés weren't avoided, but were used cleverly I might say. But the biggest issues were the villains. In all honesty the antagonists were a bit generic (war-monder and mad scientist) and a small plot twist (no spoilers) which has become a bit of an issues to superhero movies for since Captain America the Winter Soldier we haven't seen yet a truly awesome villain. By the way they were quit inaccurate with the portrait of general Lunderdorf, but I am not to bug about it ,as this a superhero film not a historical one .<br/><br/>Over all this one of the best origin story for a super-hero film and I proudly put it along side Kill Bill, Aliens, Terminator 2 and Mad Max Fury Road as great action film with females in the leading roles, girls this is the film you were waiting to add to that collection. Addictionally I am glad that women now have in public a symbol of feminism and fight to the rights of women , taking the big screen treatment!! And DC ,it took long enough."

All my fears were completely vanished after watching WW. After decades of lame female superhero movies, they finally got one right. Wonder Woman is everything we could ever wanted. Let's analyze it:<br/><br/>PROS<br/><br/><ul><li>The movie is a lot of fun! It keeps you entertained from beginning to the end.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The acting: everybody delivered great performances throughout the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Action: Fantastic! I haven't seen great action scenes since CA: Civil War. The No Man's Land sequence is already iconic.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Score: I liked the score, it wasn't mind blowing, but it did what it had to do. Every time I heard WW's theme from BvS was very exciting.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Themyscira: I loved this world, the Amazons, everything.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Cinematography: What a gorgeous film. I loved the contrast between Themyscira and London.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Directing: Can Patty Jenkins direct every DCEU movie from now on? Please?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Script: Really well written, well paced, full of great lines, heart and charismatic characters. The humor worked absolutely well.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Wonder Woman: They did the character so right, her motivations, her attitude, her kindness, everything. Also, it was very refreshing to watch a female superhero being the center at least once.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gal Gadot: She was absolutely fantastic, really charismatic. Her chemistry with Chris Pine was incredible. Gadot IS Wonder Woman and I can't imagine no one else playing the part.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Emotion: If you don't cry watching WW, you will at least get goosebumps in some scenes.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Messages: This is a superhero with something to say. It talks about humanity, love, patriarchy and war.</li></ul><br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/><ul><li>Villains: A superhero movie with forgettable villains, wow, I've never seen that before!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Third act: predictable, kinda generic, too much CGI, silly and almost lost me. The movie was so simple and original until the ending, when it turned out to be like every recent superhero movie climax ever.</li></ul><br/><br/>If they changed the third act and villains, it would have been an perfect movie. But still, WW is a ton of fun and the best DCEU movie yet. Go see it!"
"eyes-0nly","9","6","15","5 June 2017"," Not another childish superhero movie
","**Contains spoiler<br/><br/>I like most of the choreography, however I find the movements lack proper physics. In the scenes when Diana fights, many of the moves, mainly in mid-flight movements lacked power. In the final fight, I find Gal Gadot didn't show proper emotion, mainly in the angry/sad moments. Somehow the acting seemed dull. I think the idea of exploding villains is very silly nowadays. Can be made to be more mature, which is expected from DC movies, unfortunately the rating prevents realistic things to be shown.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the overall quality of the movie is great. Highly recommended."

","After a good but later mediocre standoff that is BvS, and the disappointment that is Suicide Squad, many people believe that DCEU is doomed to fail...<br/><br/>Let's be honest: 2017 is DC's year, and yes, this is from a Marvel fan.<br/><br/>Directed by Patty Jenkins and stars Gal Gadot in the title character, Wonder Woman is a sharp spear that finally, breaks the bad DCEU curse. In fact, it's the best superhero origin story since Iron Man. Even though Marvel has given us the masterpiece that is Logan (technically, it's Fox. but hey, it's still Marvel to me), the awesome mix that is GotG2, and maybe the unexpectedly great Thor: Ragnarok and Spiderman: Homecoming this year, You've gotta give at least a chance for DC to proof itself, and this year, they made it. DC won this year, period.<br/><br/>Pros: Gal Gadot owned the character! She's very good in this movie. I like how she's not comfortable during the city scene. She also brings a sense of humanity to the character, which is also a plus. Chris Pine is great as Steve Trevor. The rest of the cast also gives their best performances, especially the character of Charlie, Chief and the German general guy. The relationship between Diana and Steve, my god it's heartwarming.<br/><br/>The script is great. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. Zack Snyder proofs himself that he IS a good writer (as long as he's away from the typical somber/sad tone in literary every DC movie (execpt The Dark Knight trilogy)). It can be cheesy sometimes, but it doesn't matter, it don't affect the movie much. The script is, surprisingly hits a emotional tone as well. It's unbelievably sad and it's definitely a plus for the movie. Oh, and the movie's more lighthearted, much like Marvel, and that I definitely appreciate it. <br/><br/>The action scenes were great as usual. A mix of practical and CGI which blended perfectly. The final fight is a CGI fest, which is cheesy yet glorious at the same time. Thankfully, the producers realize their mistakes in BvS, and as the result, the fight didn't went as bad as BvS. Oh, and I already tell that the music is eargasmic?<br/><br/>Cons: A typical problem in every superhero movie: Plot holes, bad CGI, and a weak villain. Otherwise, I don't see a flaw in this movie<br/><br/>Overall, Wonder Woman exceeds all expectations, and proofing that DC can be as good as Marvel. Beautifully shot, well acted, great writing, awesome action sequences, and well directed, Wonder Woman is definitely worth your time, and it is DC's best since The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>Congratulations DCEU you've striked a homer. Sincrely, from a MCU fan<br/><br/>*did I also tell you that Gal Gadot is freakin beautiful?"
"ariannavalentine","9","6","15","3 June 2017"," First time movie goer
","A very good movie. It makes sure to show you where Wonder Woman comes from and the type of life she lives there. It also depicts her going to the ""real world"" and how it changes her. I did make the mistake of seeing this in 3D which in my opinion was a waste of extra money. Nothing popped off the screen at me like one would expect. But that could have been the theater i went to as well. Overall the movie is great and has a great story line that explains about the history of Wonder Woman. I myself gave this movie 9* for the action, adventure and story line. It definitely doesn't leave you bored."
"illumiinati","9","6","15","1 June 2017"," A big welcome to Wonder Woman on the big screen
","Finally DC gets it right and how!<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is the movie DC fans have been waiting all along. It has a soul of its own and a very good story to tell. It catches your attention from the first scene and keeps you glued to your seat (almost), till the end. Diana's origin story, self realization and her inner conflicts are very well depicted. Almost all the central characters are etched out very well & as an audience you would definitely connect with them, emotionally too. The screenplay is well structured. Action scenes are good and CGI is apt.<br/><br/>Performance wise Gal Gadot and Chris Pine do an amazing job. Gal Gadot brings life to the character. She makes Wonder Woman's naiveness, innocence, strength and emotions very real. Chris Pine is perfectly cast as Steve. He gets ample one liners and delivers them with panache. Like Gal, Chris too really makes the character very believable. Great work!<br/><br/>Negatives? Yeah a few - DC still leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to choreographing action sequences. The moment action sequences begin, CGI takes over. And there are instances you almost lose your connect to the on goings on screen. Because the scenes are too CGI heavy. At couple instances you could easily make out that the action figures are completely CGI. This makes the action sequences lack the soul and indulgence, that Marvel movies do so amazingly well. The movie starts out very well and maintains a good pace until the last 20 - 30 mins. There are clichés and some forced twist elements, that genuinely don't work. The bad guy does not have the desired impact, as his character is not developed as good as it should be. <br/><br/>This is the best movie in the DC universe but if WB wants to give Marvel a run for their money, there's still some work to be done. Overall, it is still a great movie. Go for it!!"
"alindsay-al","8","6","15","1 June 2017"," A great important comic book movie
","There was so much riding on this film and I was really excited for wonder woman and I can happily say that this is a great film that I really enjoyed. The premise of this film set in ww1 as it sees an amazonian princess go on a mission with an American pilot to try and stop the war. Gal gadot made her debut as wonder woman in dawn of justice but this is her solo movie now and she does a truly great job. She sells the physicality of the role and she did a really good job in the action scenes, but I was truly surprised by the humour and humanity that she really bought to the role. Chris pine plays Steve Trevor in this film and I thought he was fantastic in the role, he had likability, charisma and a great chemistry with gadot, i enjoyed watching their relationship develop and his performance was so enjoyable. However, I gotta be honest the rest of the cast doesn't really add anything to this film especially when it comes to the villains and it does bring this film down. The story has a great fish out of water coming of age story for Diana and I truly bought it. I loved her development in this film and how her development with Steve Trevor really drew me into the story and seeing how Diana really develops in this world of man. The script was a really surprise as I found this film pretty funny at times, especially with the great drama used as well. It really adds a lot of depth too the main characters and really helps. The style of the film is quite contrasting, there is some great action scenes especially in no man's land that sold women woman as a hero. However, this film really overuses slow-mo that i really found a bit irritating and the final fight does overuse CGI and I found it the least interesting part of the film. Overall though this is a truly great comic book film that in my opinion does need to be watched."
"trublu215","7","11","33","30 May 2017"," This is One Surprisingly Good Movie
","Wonder Woman is the latest film in the (up until now) failed DCEU and it seriously kicks some ass. With the 2016 arrivals of Batman V Superman and the atrocious Suicide Squad, expectations were tempered with this film and rightfully so. Batman V Superman may have redeemed itself with a self-indulgent but much needed director's cut and Suicide Squad...well, yeah-that just was terrible so any pessimistic antics regarding this film are sort of justified given the track record thus far. Well, I can say without a doubt in my mind, this is one seriously cool film. Directed by Patty Jenkins and also stars Chris Pine, Danny Huston and Robin Wright, Wonder Woman is the DCEU's Marvel equivalent to Thor and it is just as good, if not, better. <br/><br/>First off, the film is very informative even to a layman. It doesn't treat things as common knowledge but it doesn't hold your hand either. This is a smart movie when it comes down to it because it doesn't rush anything. Everything in the film flows naturally, it doesn't feel like these characters are boring or that the story is not engaging. The pacing is very well set and for a film that is pushing 150 minutes, that's impressive. The acting is also surprisingly great. Gal Gadot as Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman is probably the most perfect casting in cinema history. Gadot is fierce, brave and absolutely stunning in her portrayal. It reminded me a lot of Christopher Reeve when he was Superman. The supporting cast lead by Chris Pine is also great. Pine is proving himself to be one great actor. With last year's Hell or High Water and now this, Pine is slowly proving what it means to be a movie star. Another stand out in the film is Danny Huston who seems to relish in villainous roles. Huston is really great here and I'm hoping he gets the credit he deserves. While there is much to praise with this film, there is also so issues I had with it as well. Many people were actually comparing this film to The Dark Knight at my screening. As much as I did like this film, I am also here to say: No. Not even close.<br/><br/>The issues I had with the film were more so directed in the way of the script. While I thought the pacing was great in the film, I thought some of the dialog was horrendous and cheesy. The film does escape and shed some of the very things that landed DC in hot water but it also can't seem to escape one very damaging part of DC: bad dialog. While I am sure that many people are not going to care about a misplaced line or two in between Wonder Woman kicking butt and taking names during trench warfare, it does become a bit of distraction during the less exciting moments. The moments between Pine and Gadot are very melodramatic and feel more like a soap opera at times. Many people will like it, I personally thought the cheeky stuff was more so thrown into the film rather than feeling natural.<br/><br/>Overall, Wonder Woman is a great addition to the superhero genre. It has heart, it is lighter than other DC films but also has the edge it needed to be a cut above the rest. Fans of Wonder Woman comics should be pleased and tickled pink by this lovely film adaptation and those of you who were skeptical can breathe a sigh if relief because this movie is definitely worth the price of admission."

","Usually I don't write a review but seeing all the positive ones i'm shocked that no one seams to just notice how bad the acting was, pretty face and a good body does not compensate for bad acting and terrible characters accent! Heloooo.. all the visual FX, explosion and beauty cannot shake that away!.. could unlike many other Marvel and DC movies that cast most actors that knows what they where doing, this one falls short! Ill give credit to Gal for taking this lead role but beyond the facial training for the part its a shame there was no acting classes and vocal catch .. <br/><br/>Even when comparing Wonder W character as a kid to the adult the kid was more believable in acting skills with a batter accent, the supporting actors carried the film by a mile other wise it would have been a complete flop .."
"srdjan_veljkovic","4","8","22","6 June 2017"," After you take out feminist propaganda and misandry - a mediocre superhero film
","Granted, if you compare to Elektra or Catwoman, this is better. But, other than that, it's nothing special really.<br/><br/>Feminist propaganda is too much (we are ""reminded"" every 15 minutes or so that ""men are bad and only useful for procreation""), but misandry is not as bad as one might expect (it's mostly to feel sorry for the men, not to treat them bad). But, if one were to take them out, what is left is a bunch of stuff that don't make much sense, even if you consider it's about some comic book version of Greek Gods - thus, not even superheroes, really.<br/><br/>Take, for example, the praised ""No Man's Land"" scene. Is Wonder Woman invulnerable or not? That is, like Superman, if a bullet hits her, it doesn't harm her. There are two options:<br/><br/>1. She is not invulnerable - then, she can't possibly protect herself with those glorified bracelets against a whole army shooting. At least some bullets will hit her in the legs and, also, she's fast, but even as a goddess, she can't be at more than two places at once with her arms, so, if 3 bullets are going towards her...<br/><br/>2. She is invulnerable - then, what's with the bracelets? Just walk over and beat them up.<br/><br/>There's not much fun or funny moments, most jokes are with at least a touch of misandry.<br/><br/>Last, but not the least, Gal Gadot is not a good actress and doesn't really look that good. She's OK, but she's far from the ""most beautiful woman in the world"" and, while she obviously trained a lot, doesn't fit that great in that silly armor. She fit much better in the white dress in Batman vs Superman. A better actress would do a better job of showing her innocence in learning about the real world, which could have been much more fun."

","I never do reviews for any movies, but I had to for this one. Simply put it was amazing; and if you haven't seen it yet, do so asap. DC has struggled immensely over the years it seems with movies, well this is the spark (or the break rather) that it needed to (eventually) catch up to Marvel. Wonder Woman most certainly compares to.the likes of the first Avengers movie and the likes of Batman the Dark Knight. What an incredible movie!!!"

"pepe4u22","3","8","22","3 June 2017"," typical dc promise turns wrong
","Went to this movie with high expectations and the first third of movie started terrific with terrific character development and wonderful acting then with the introduction of the Chris Pine the movie starts a quick descent. Pine plays the damsal in distress and has the screen presence of a slug no emotion and just a pretty face but vacuous. then the movie shifts to London and we are met with an array of characters who come and go in a heartbeat. then we go to the part that absolutely annoyed me is how this movie treated in many ways the character of Ludendorff and I hope the producers are ashamed of the way they showed a true military leader in such disregard that they killed him in movie when the real Ludendorff died almost 20 years later is a joke and as a person who's family served in the first war under Ludendorff I found this offensive. now if they had any clue why not just make up a character like movies have done for the last 100 years and use some creativing have the aries character move from Ludendorff character to an obscure Austrian corporal known as Hitler. also the scene where pines character infiltrated the German high command castle was stupid too having an character of eastern descent driving a car to a German retreat and they would not be alarmed stupid and ludicrous. plus the pacing of movie slow could have been tightened easily 20 minutes and the constant cuts in action scenes made me want to watch good action scenes like in john wick and john wick 2. the best part of movie was gal gadat the lead giving a wonderful performance everything else was an abdomination"
"alex-vaewsorn","5","8","22","3 June 2017"," It's a movie, not fine cinema, yet it's 2.5hrs?
","Watch about half this film, like I did, and you'll see that it's all pretty typical superhero fare. But it is not engaging enough to be a 2.5hr movie. For me it just felt like repetition of the last 10yrs of fantasy action.<br/><br/>Gal is stunning, so I'm happy I saw the first half of it. But everything else about the movie is pretty lame. Good things about this movie.. hmm.. Gal Gadot... and......<br/><br/>Anyways, total retread of things past. I guess superhero movies went out with a bang in 2008. Ah the Dark Knight. It's 2017 and we'd better wake up. I feel like the 10 star reviews are by children, and adults out of some kind of dystopia where Trump is president"
"dreamdemon-1","4","8","22","1 June 2017"," Enjoyable for the most part but editing kills it in the end
","Can't say I was ever a fan of Wonder Woman but then again I'm not a fan of DCU in general with the exception of Batman (hated the atrocious embodiment by Ben Affleck though). Given that I thoroughly hated the new Superman movies as well as the awful Superman vs Batman ... whatever that was, I still decided to give WW a shot ... and I was pleasantly surprised for the most part. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman puts all other recent DC movies to shame through a nice character introduction and the build-up, though predictable (well, it's a comics inspired movie after all) it's well supported by Pine and Gadot and once their little band comes together, Taghmaoui also gets a piece of spotlight. Several in fact.<br/><br/>I was half expecting to dread the WWI background but instead I found it refreshing. Marvel's Captain American went on for WWII, a decision saved by keeping the war in the background. Here it serves as a vehicle for the discovery of humanity, as shallow as it may be. <br/><br/>There's plenty to like in the movie, the fighting scenes are decently choreographed, the soundtrack is great, the characters are expectedly one-dimensional.<br/><br/>On the downside: - the editing keeps the movie from being a blast. At one point, the group who met WW couple of days ago and barely exchanged words somehow find it to give her a boost the same way she was trained as a child. I bet somewhere there's a scene that would've explained that moment - the nonsense about love and humanity that Gadot is made to spew at the very end basically wrecks the entire character buildup - David Thewlis is completely miscast. His appearance in armour is ridiculous (seriously, professor Lupin as a full fledged action hero??), at one point he's without helmet and the mustache complements the armour like a dog flea complements a cup of Earl Grey. - the movie takes itself much to seriously and I do take into account that the few bits of humour revolve around a formerly isolated person who gets updated on to the current state of things. It does pull a few laughs but not nearly enough."
"hippo-36385","9","12","37","2 June 2017"," The new savior of DC series
","I didn't expect much from this movie in the begin because I usually don't like the style of DC hero movies. But after watching Gal Gadot playing the role so beautifully and so fiercely, I changed my whole mind. The movie addressed a bit of gender equality, a bit of history, a bit of culture, a bit of humor, and lots of actions. I enjoy all the slow motion of Wonder Woman's fighting. The soundtracks and ending credits song are all good. In short, this movie and Wonder Woman is the new savior of DC movie series"
"kevinM23","3","5","12","5 January 2020"," Wonder Woman???
","Is this movie really about Wonder Woman or that guy who discovered an island full of women? (An island full of women .... isn't that interesting? LOL. Everytime I see that, a sexually frustrated man's fantasy comes to mind.) Anyways, with a little spoilers, the movie sort of goes like this. Wonder Woman got encouraged to leave the island cuz the guy found her. Wonder Woman got into the war with the guidance of the guy. Wonder Woman thoughtlessly and rashly about to do something stupid but prevented by the wisdom and the courage of the guy in time. Wonder Woman awakened her true godlike power due to the guy's heroic sacrifice.<br/><br/>The movie should have been called ""Scott, the Wonder Woman Maker."" Was his name Scott? Idk. And that's not important cuz Scott or whatever his name was should not have ever been the origin in the making of Wonder Woman but Wonder Woman herself. How dare a woman finds her true calling without a heroic man's help, right? How dare a woman finds her own way out of a swam of obstacles like Batman, Superman, Spiderman, right? TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE story.<br/><br/>A story is the foundation of its storytelling and anything else. Since it sucks in this movie, everything else just looked meh and uninteresting."

"kersundomagoj","2","5","12","12 November 2017"," Just another overrated hero movie!
","As the title of my review says Wonder Women is just another overrated hero movie. <br/><br/>Wonder Women follows the same line of story as any other hero movie. You have a hero A who fights the villain A because villain A wants to bring chaos, agony or what not to the World and with that formula of to conveyor belt to produce million hero movies per year so Hollywood can make money from mediocrity and low intelligence of the viewers.<br/><br/>Side note...I did not pay any money to watch this movie. I do not support crap.<br/><br/>Acting is nothing special, last battle is the definition of cliché, plot twist is lame, in some scenes they are trying to be funny but they are failing, it is full of PG-13 crap so no blood, bad language or any sign of maturity that can attract smart movie viewers, etc...<br/><br/>Plot twist is that they are presenting some German Officer to be the bad guy and it is then discovered the true bad guy is some dude who was helping them all the way and OFC he wants to bring chaos because he is a ""badass"" bad guy, wow, omg! Plus it is predictable as hell.<br/><br/>Another plot twist is that Amazons are saying Zeus left them a weapon to fight a bad guy. It is supposedly a sword but from start you know that is Wonder Women and not some rusty sword or whatever, wow, omg again. Here I raise another question. So if Wonder Women was the only one who could defeat the bad guy so at the start of the movie why did her mother object about her training? They know the bad guy is alive and will return so why refuse to train the only weapon they have against the bad guy? Awesome writing I guess...#Sarcasm<br/><br/>Overall Wonder Women is really one bad movie like any other hero movie. Today hero movies don't offer anything special in the term of story and they only switch names of the heroes and bad guys like I said at the start of the review. They produce what I will say a cancer genre to movie industry. Hero movies are destroying the movie industry with their dumb ideas and lame stories.<br/><br/>2 out of 10 only because Gal is beautiful women but mediocre actor."
"lovelypagesreviews","9","5","12","12 November 2017"," A 'Wonder' Woman Saved DCEU
","Ask and you shall receive a few years later but it was worth the wait. For years, DC fans have asked for a superhero movie to push DC up a level. And Wonder Woman did it. Patty Jenkins did it. Gat Gadot did it. Women did it. It's really hard not to gloat especially when for years the narrative was that women aren't into action movies or superhero movies. That women can't direct them and a woman as a lead can't appeal to the audience.<br/><br/>Well, how about that?<br/><br/>Coming out of the cinema, and barely two hours after the Wonder Woman premiere, I can barely find the words to describe the experience. Because that's what it was. Last year I was in awe to see Batman and Superman on the same screen. I didn't care for the quality of the movie or the fighting that didn't happen between them; I'm a fan who's easily pleased and just seeing them on the screen together was enough. Martha ridiculousness put aside. But the moment Wonder Woman appeared out of nowhere in the middle, shield on one arm and sword on the other, I was sold. Diana became a bright spot in this dark and gloomy universe to look forward to and boy did she deliver.<br/><br/>No matter how many times I'd seen the trailer nothing could possible prepare me for the places this movie would take me.<br/><br/>Origin story? Check. <br/><br/>Coming of age story? Check. <br/><br/>Badass action scenes? Check. <br/><br/>Unbelievable character growth? Check. <br/><br/>Humor? Check check check check. <br/><br/>Love story? Check. <br/><br/>WW1? Check. <br/><br/>Mythology? Check.<br/><br/>It checks all the freaking boxes. Wonder Woman is a movie DC fans can be proud of and actually scream it from the rooftops, DC DID THAT! The movie starts as an origin story of Diana, I didn't expect there to be so much of her background, yes for future movies the character had to be properly set but this went deep and it felt amazing to be in their world and see the Amazons training and fight, they were majestic, so beautiful and out of this world – literally. And it moves to a coming of age story as Diana realizes her powers are unlike her fellow Amazons. Enter Steve Trevor, a spy who crushes on her island.<br/><br/>As Diana arrives in London ready to stop the war that will end all wars, WW1 becomes the center of the story. It did remind me a lot of Captain America: The First Avenger, and that's a huge compliment. WW allows the character's arc to slowly build up and especially during the second act, Diana takes a huge step as Wonder Woman and reveals her true identity, walking into No Man's Land.<br/><br/>Apart from the color that was greatly lacking in the previous DC movies, color matters people use it, WW managed to give each character the amount of screen time required to make me care for them. Diana wasn't just WW, kicking asses and being a God among people. Steve wasn't just her romantic partner, he brought a lot to this movie, and the sidekicks each brought something small that in the third act mattered a lot.<br/><br/>If I had to nitpick and say something negative, that would be the villain, sure by now I'm used to villains being a little over the top and so dramatic.. could it have been better? Sure. Did that make the movie less wonderful than it was? No. Is it re-watchable as a standalone superhero movie that covers multiple genres? Yes!<br/><br/>With a run time of 2h 21min and even with my OCD, there's not a minute to spare on this one, every second was captivating, every scene valuable, every character irreplaceable. Kudos to Patty Jenkins for finally bringing us a memorable DC movie, kudos to the cast for delivering top- notch performances. <br/><br/>There's a scene where Queen Hippolyta stays to Diana, be careful in the world of men, Diana, they do not deserve you. And we truly do not."
"jacobs-greenwood","8","5","12","10 October 2017"," Lots of action, and some symbolism, in this entertaining superhero adventure
","Gal Gadot is beautifully believable in the title role as Diana 'Prince', the brave Amazon whose mission is to defeat the evil Greek god Ares, whom she naively thinks is the source of all evil in the world when she learns it's in the throes of the ""war to end all wars"" (aka World War I).<br/><br/>The film opens briefly in modern day Paris with Gadot's character, a curator at The Louvre, receiving then opening a case containing a photographic plate depicting her in a post battle pose with a ragtag group of soldiers from that war. She reflects on her childhood growing up on Themyscira, a paradise hidden from the outside world and populated by Amazon women, all beautiful and prepared for a fight.<br/><br/>Initially, Diana's mother Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) resists having her spunky 'daughter' Princess Diana - whom she'd formed from clay - train as all Amazonians under her sister Antiope (Robin Wright), who insists that not preparing Diana for ""what she was made for"" is dangerous. ""What she was made for"" is kept under wraps, even from Diana, until later though - pushed by Antiope -Diana gets a glimpse of her special gifting shortly before the world interrupts.<br/><br/>Suddenly the outside, foggy barrier of Themyscira is breached by a Nazi plane which we soon learn is flown by an escaping American spy named Steve Trevor; Chris Pine is perfect as the ""above average"" hero. Diana rescues Steve from drowning and pulls him ashore shortly before the two are shot at from some German boats that followed his plane into the idyllic setting. Soon Amazon women are swooping down from the cliffs into the battle on the beach where they're joined by Diana, Steve and Amazons on horseback. But several lose their lives before the last of the invaders do, including Antiope.<br/><br/>Diana's innocent upbringing shattered, and convinced that her mother's stories are true - that Ares, though wounded by Zeus thousands of years earlier, must still be alive because of the war - she is determined to leave the island to defeat Ares so it will end. Since the Queen is against this, Diana steals the sword she'd been told is the god- killer before leaving with Steve to travel to the front.<br/><br/>But Steve has lied to Diana, a new concept for her, and first takes her to London where he hopes a book of formulas he'd stolen earlier from Dr. 'Poison' Maru (Elena Anaya) and Nazi General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) will convince the Allied command that the Germans aren't interested in armistice but instead in using an horrific weapon at the front. In truth, it's Ludendorff, powerful thanks to a gas the doctor has given him, that plans on using the game- changing gas to kill thousands. When Steve sees that the high command is unmoved by his claims, he pretends to back down while planning to do the ""right thing"".<br/><br/>Steve assembles that ragtag group, which consists of profiteer Sameer (Saïd Taghmaoui), weary sharpshooter drunk Charlie (Ewen Bremner), and deposed American Indian tracker Chief (Eugene Brave Rock). Lucy Davis provides comic relief as Steve's helpful secretary Etta. Just as the unfunded group is about to get underway, the top British diplomat Sir Patrick (David Thewlis) provides financial assistance while arranging for Etta to be their communications center in his office.<br/><br/>The action begins after Steve, Diana and the others arrive at the front and enter the trenches, where progress is measured in years. When she learns from a refugee woman that there's a nearby Belgian German-occupied town where its people are starving, Diana decides to stop following Steve and his plan. She emerges from the trenches as Wonder Woman in full regalia - a stunning red-white-and-blue outfit with shield and sword - and fearlessly approaches the enemy. Deflecting single bullets with her forearm armor, she soon has to crouch down behind her shield as the German's machine guns train on her. When Steve realizes that she has the Nazis' full attention, he leads an assault on their positions and the Allies overrun their enemy. Diana, Steve and the others then continue into the Belgian village where she leads another impressive assault against the odds to defeat the German occupiers.<br/><br/>It is at this point that the action wanes while the drama intensifies. Diana comes to believe that Ludendorff is Ares in the flesh, but she's initially stopped from killing him by Steve. While he's been impressed with Diana's considerable talents, Steve's not sure he believes the whole Ares legend thing. Unfortunately, this gives Ludendorff the opportunity to test his weapon on the Belgian town, and all of its villagers are wiped out by the deadly gas. Losing her trust in Steve, Diana goes after Ludendorff herself but, after successfully killing him, learns that man has evil within himself, and is disillusioned. Steve leaves her to join his compatriots in an attempt to destroy the rest of the gas, which has been loaded onto a bomber (plane).<br/><br/>Diana is then visited by Sir Patrick, who is in fact Ares. He reveals to her that it is she - and not the sword - that was made to be the god-killer Zeus left behind. Though Diana doesn't believe him, they fight an epic battle and, while the Germans are distracted by the ""fireworks"", Steve and the ragtags successfully hijack the bomber. But it isn't until she is nearly down for the count, and Steve successfully detonates the gas container filled bomber safely out of killing range, that Diana realizes man also has good within himself, and comes to believe that she can defeat Ares. When she does, the next scene indicates that the war is indeed over and the narrative returns to the present day where the promise of Diana's future (cinematic) interventions into man's affairs is foreshadowed."

"patalingjugaeron","9","5","12","29 July 2017"," A great, stunning and wonderful movie but with a flaw
","Truly, this is the best movie that DCEU had to offer, following the critically maligned Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad. First of all, Patty Jenkins was great in directing this movie since Monster in 2003 in which Charlize Theron won an Academy Award for Best Actress and like Monster, Wonder Woman also does apply the same formula.<br/><br/>Second, this movie also contained messages of humanity, heart and depth which is truly good and Third, Gal Gadot also possessed the charms, heart, and soul to make her wonderful performance excellent and memorable plus her kick-ass action sequences are awesome. Some of the references from The Little Mermaid in which the main character explores the outside world and becomes fascinated (calling it ""fish out of water"") is also a good inclusion. Chris Pine, Connie Nielsen, and Danny Huston does give a good performances but Danny Huston's performance is somehow intimidating.<br/><br/>Even the action sequences, it's mind-blowing with slow-motion references from The Matrix that makes the movie cool and the pacing is also good. Plus, the musical score even the thematic tune is bombastic.<br/><br/>But the flaw in this movie is that it gives too much exposition, David Thewlis somehow fell a bit flat in his performance though not terrible."
"diac228","8","5","12","14 July 2017"," DC Finding Its Groove Back, Wonder Woman is propelled by great direction and Gal Gadot
","I have been a vocal critic of the Warner Brothers/DC array of entertainment since Dark Knight Rises disappointed me immensely during that one fateful night. And for years after that I have been led down a dark path of pure disillusionment that ranges from the frustrating Snyder saga that gets nearly everything wrong, the unforgivable Teen Titans reboot, the strange cartoons we've seen of Batman, and of course the fiasco involving the animated adaptation of Killing Joke's abysmal first act. It's reached a point in which I was accused of just hating DC altogether. But I have finally seen a good side of DC cinematically, and it's in the shape of Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman isn't perfect, but is hands-down the best product from the DC/Warner Brothers spectrum since The Dark Knight ignited and changed the film industry back in 2008. Whatever issues you can dig up in the movie will be eradicated by a superb cast, great amount of respect for the source material, and an entertaining flick with a nice blend of action, comedy, drama, and comic book flair. The film doesn't try too hard to win you over, as it paces nicely to allow you to warm up to our newest Wonder Woman and her allies.<br/><br/>Damaging some of the momentum of Wonder Woman has nothing to do with the movie, but its actually the timing. If this had been made and released before Batman vs. Superman and the revelation of Justice League it could have had a deeper impact to the DCEU; similar to when the original Iron Man jump-started the ultra-successful Marvel series of films. Wonder Woman sets the correct tone and mood for the DCEU and is the first of the modern DC properties to successfully establish the direction the comic book company was engaging in. It's dark, its gritty, doesn't have much time for jokes, even if we saw plenty of them in the first two acts.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is absolutely perfect as Wonder Woman. Whatever complaints you may have had about her should be diminished off of the face of the earth because she gave the role life, personality, a sense of wonderment, a layer of feminist power, and the exotic flavor to truly separate her from the rest of the characters in World War 1 Europe. She has great chemistry with everyone around her, especially Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, the WW1 spy that accidentally stumbles upon the hidden world of Themyscira. Trevor's initial appearance allows the plot to move from Diana's hometown to wartorn England, where she wants to find the source of the war and end it as soon as possible using her warrior skillset, determination, and desire to make the world good again. Of course, with war, there is no easy answer, there is no person to point to, which contradicts Princess Diana's viewpoints of the way the world works.<br/><br/>Not sure how Patty Jenkins, a great but quiet director, wound up with the director's chair since she isn't as big a name in Hollywood. Nonetheless, she does a great job with Wonder Woman by spending time with the characters, allowing us to get to know everyone, and showcasing the horrors and consequences of war to complicate a simple plot. Then we have the feminist empowerment imagery and the well-designed action sequences that make up for the budget that isn't quite as high as that of the Marvel blockbusters. The village battle sequence especially is a delight. The final act however behaves a bit much like Marvel when it could have behaved more like the grounded Dark Knight in terms of content and execution (the villain should have been handled differently, common theme in recent comic book films), but it won't ruin the overall experience in the least bit.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman connects better with the audience than the modern Batman and modern Superman. Chalk that up to Snyder and the subpar writing team, but Wonder Woman just might wind up being the new face of the DCEU because of Gadot and the way she has handled the character. This is the one branch of the franchise that needs to be protected from weak sequels and weak decision-making towards the character's future. They have something great here, about as strong as Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man portrayal. I beg they don't mess this up, as Wonder Woman is the best-written and performed cinematic female superhero since Elastigirl from The Incredibles.<br/><br/>We finally have a DC movie on par with Marvel. Even though Wonder Woman imitated Marvel a bit too much in the climax, this is still a step in the right direction. Jenkins, Gadot (especially), Pine, Allen Heinberg (wrote the script), and the rest of the cast should be proud for striking the right combination between comic book mayhem and great emotional depth to allow us to care for the cast. I am silently begging that DC and Snyder doesn't mess this up, even though the track record would say otherwise. Wonder Woman is a long-awaited empowering delight, and hopefully a sign of more great DC-related works to come."
"dssadhyapak","9","5","12","10 July 2017"," Simply brilliant and amazing!
","So here we are in 2017! Audience and critics alike still criticizing DC for not being able to make a solid movie in the right tone, without studio interventions etc. Well, they can all watch this fantastic movie called Wonder Woman (2017) and finally bring back their hopes in the DC Movie Universe or DC Cinematic Universe :)<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a marvelous movie, that has finally revived the DCCU, and made it for a fun, ""multiple-times watchable"" movie experience. (I'm not including Christopher Nolan's the Dark Knight trilogy, as that's just on a whole different level above all this!). Gal Gadot proved all her naysayers wrong, and was absolutely amazing in this movie (I mean her acting and her role, obviously :P).<br/><br/>Jokes apart, this was a well-directed, beautifully shot, properly edited movie. The drastic effects of war, the spirit of women empowerment, the visual effects, story, the colors (Yes this movie has some colorful imagery for different scenes, her lasso, her powers etc) and the fight sequences were downright splendid.<br/><br/>The movie starts with Diana receiving the photo of her posing with Steve and others, which Bruce Wayne found out in Batman vs Superman, and she goes on to narrate her origin story. We go to Themyscira, a home to the Amazon race of warrior women created by the gods of Mount Olympus to protect humankind against the corruption of Ares, the God of war. We meet her mother Hippolyta, who feels she does not require any training as Ares is dead, and her aunt Antiope, who secretly trains her to become a skilled warrior.<br/><br/>We get proper introductions of who she was, what was the urge in her to become a skilled warrior, how she is THE one and only Wonder Woman, why she feels the need to go help Steve and the others in the World War after he crashes onto her island and tells them about what is going on in the real world outside, and why she is such a badass!<br/><br/>The movie takes it's own time in the first half to get to this though. After a pretty good battle sequence at Themyscira, the movie slows down a little in the middle to build character/relationship between our protagonists Steve and Diana. They travel to London to return a book containing important information obtained by Steve to defeat the Germans, led by General Ludendorff and Dr. Maru (Dr. Poison). During their visit to London, the movie provides for some good comic relief when Diana tries to adjust to the general mannerisms in the society, and thankfully the jokes do land! Phew!<br/><br/>And then the awesome stuff starts! Some of the best moments of Wonder Woman are the fight scenes. The one at the Western front in Belgium, where she pretty much kicks everyone's ass and saves the villagers was arguably the best scene in the movie. What inspired her to finally reveal herself to the world and become Wonder Woman, was shown brilliantly in this fight scene, where she gets up from the trenches, bravely stands out and starts defending the bullets with her shield! Wow! No point in me describing it here. You must see for it yourself! The one in the end with Ares was good too. I'm no CGI expert, but I definitely believe they did the CGI heavy action better here than in Doomsday in Batman vs Superman. Both these and other action scenes were jaw-droppingly amazing! What you saw in the trailers is nothing. When you see all those fight sequences in the theatres with Hans Zimmer's instrumental in the background, it sure is guaranteed to get your feet kicking with joy and excitement!<br/><br/>The one small problem I had with this movie was some of the villains. This seems to be a recurring problem across many comic book movies these past few years, be it Marvel or DC, and God knows who can make this right (Thanos, you better be good). In this movie, Ares was a pretty good villain, and was an equal match for our Diana. Sadly, not much could be done with him, as revealing that Sir Patrick was Ares could have ruined the twist. Ludendorff was okayish. He inhaled some gas and was somewhat powerful, but was nothing in front of Diana. The worst was Dr. Poison. Not much character development was given to her at all, and she was at best a disposable villain. Sigh!<br/><br/>I usually don't like romantic or rom-com stuff in movies. Don't know why though. In this movie however, I bought into the relationship between Steve and Diana. During the 1st half when they both were ""romancing?"" I was like ""Urgh!"", but it had a good payoff in the end with Steve sacrificing his life by flying the plane full of bombs in the air due to his love for Diana (Unfortunately though, I'd already seen a similar ending in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D so the effect wasn't that much). That being mentioned, Chris Pine did a good job portraying his character. Thankfully, this movie was also not all about ""Women are good, Men are bad!"". Steve and his other mates also had something to do! Not bad, movie. Not bad.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic movie that needs to be watched multiple times. It has seriously brought back hopes in me regarding the DCCU, and now I so can't wait for Justice League! My rating - 9/10!<br/><br/>If you liked this review, check out my blog for more reviews on English movies and TV, and Tamil movies here-<br/><br/>https://sudarshanmovieandtvreviews.blogspot.in/ Thanks for reading. :)"
"Vartiainen","Null","5","12","29 June 2017"," The movie we need and deserve
","Directed by Patty Jenkins and starring the amazing Gal Gadot, this film finally delivered what we have been expecting from both DCEU, and superhero films in general, for years. Not only does it have a female superhero as the unchallenged lead character, but it's also a genuinely great film with fantastic characters, an engaging storyline, beautiful action scenes and phenomenal production values.<br/><br/>And this could have gone wrong so easily. Chris Pine could have been made the actual lead character, with Wonder Woman playing a support role in her own title movie. It could have been just as dark and gloomy as the previous DCEU films. It could so easily have been too corny and pandering.<br/><br/>But it's not. Chris Pine is fantastic as the male lead, but this story is about Wonder Woman, and Gadot delivers us one of the best superheros in cinema history. It's so refreshing, almost revolutionary, to see superhero that does good not because she has to, or because she believes she's the only one that can or because she just happened to be there, but because she wants to. Because it's the right thing to do. When you think about it, that's much rarer than you think. There's Captain America. But aside from him, who else? Certainly no one in the DC films. And not all characters can be like that, not all should be like that. But some do.<br/><br/>And that whole ideal permeates the entire film. It's honest and goodhearted. It delivers a straightforward origins story that still has the capacity to talk about the meaning of human life, about responsibility, about corruptibility, about the duality of human morality. It believes that people can do terrible things, but also that they can rise up and stand for what they believe to be right. Its heroine is not some distant god-figure - despite being the only literal god in the DC film canon so far - that flies far above us bringing with her chaos and destruction. Rather she walks amongst us and raises us up to stand next to her.<br/><br/>It even has colours in it. Actual vibrant colours. And the fight scenes are some of the best I've ever see. The characters have depth and forge actual bonds between one another. It's even funny. Actually funny. I laughed multiple times throughout the film.<br/><br/>And yes, the end battle is weaker than the rest of the film. Noticeably so. But it is preceded by a great twist, looks pretty cool and the final ending after that is heartwarming. But the rest of the film is so good that I can forgive that one scene.<br/><br/>I healed a little bit inside as I watched this film. It is an honest film, with no trickery, no wise-cracking at the audience, no emotional manipulation. It isn't afraid to be called cheesy because it knows that you have to take that risk in order to connect emotionally. And by gods, does it succeed. Easily one of the best superhero films ever made. Please, do yourself a favour."
"RocheK01","8","5","12","27 June 2017"," Close to magnificent
","Movie was just as I hoped for, as Diana is my favorite DC character. The movie portrays her wonderfully in the fact that she is ferocious and strong. But the movie also tries to make her to much of a romantic, which I thought kind of made the movie not as much fun. If it stuck to just the dancing and maybe just a kiss it would have worked much better, but her reminiscing on Steve in the last fight kind of blew it for me."

"xamtaro","9","5","12","26 June 2017"," Continuing DCEU's more serious and philosophical examination of superheroes
","The origin story of the quintessential female superhero is finally realised on the big screen. Only the fourth entry into the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), WONDER WOMAN is an feature length flashback detailing the events behind the mysterious photo from the First World War that was shown in 2016's BATMAN V SUPERMAN. <br/><br/>Before she became a hero, Diana of the Amazons had only known a paradise of sisters forged in the ideals of cooperation and a Mission to defend the world against Ares, the last of the old Greek gods. Her perfect world is shattered when war comes to Paradise Island in the form of the American spy Steve Trevor and a ship full of German enemy pursuers. Diana in her innocent idealism believes Ares to be responsible for the war and leaves the island with Trevor in the hope that killing Ares will spare innocent lives from the horrors of war.<br/><br/>Giving life to the character of Diana is actress Gal Gadot. Gal is a dead ringer for the iconic superhero, looking exactly like she stepped out of the comic books. The earnestness she brings to the role perfectly conveys Diana's innocence and idealistic outlook. Much time is spent focused on the characters such that even side characters receive decent characterisation and development. <br/><br/>Diana shares a magnificent chemistry with co-star Chris Pine playing the world weary captain Steve Trevor. Their romantic sub plot can be compared to classic romances like Casablanca, masterfully and tastefully realised on screen. But the more intriguing aspect is when the movie goes into their minds, showing their contrasting perspectives on life.<br/><br/>Diana approaches her Mission like a child approaching a fairy tale story. Clear black and white morality, destroy the bad guy and the world is saved. That simple. Unfortunately, it is not that simple and her entire story is one of growing up and seeing the truth about humanity's ugly nature. On the flip side, Trevor straddles the line of cynicism; he knows full well the worst that humanity is capable of yet cannot bring himself to break Diana's innocent worldview.<br/><br/>What begins as a relatively run of the mill superhero origin story morphs into a surprisingly deep narrative that seeks to shatter viewer expectations. True to the DCEU, WONDER WOMAN, like its predecessors, explores some heady themes against the backdrop of war. Key of which is weighing Diana's idealism against worldly cynicism and outright nihilism. <br/><br/>The movie explores those perspectives through its characters, never preaching one over the other and coming to a mature conclusion that ties into an ongoing theme of ""hero by choice, not by obligation"" that the DCEU movies had been conveying.<br/><br/>The movie never shies away from showing the true horrors of combat, broken families, broken people, a hero helpless against the odds, a truly dark time serving as a stark contrast to the amazon's paradise island. Into this darkness comes Diana herself who is given ample opportunity to flex her powers in a spectacular show of Super heroics. Patty Jenkins approaches the action like a pro, keeping to the more fantastic, speed ramped portrayal of superhero fighting as established by Zack Snyder, while adding her own touches such as the amazons' uniquely cooperative battle tactics (which gets a wonderful payoff later in the movie). Her masterful direction extends to the balanced tone of the movie. Many comic book movies prefer to stuff their narrative with humour, even in the middle of intense battle scenes, such that the movie fails to take itself seriously. WONDER WOMAN does not fall into that trap. <br/><br/>The battles are approached with respectful gravitas, and a genuine sense of peril. Bookending such sequences are character centred scenes in a peaceful setting which help to develop their relationships in a very natural and heartfelt way. There is humour and it is used sparingly, never detracting from the underlying themes or the seriousness of the setting.<br/><br/>This balance gives us a product that can easily appeal to everyone. Diana as a character is one that anyone who had ever been a child can relate to. The epic action, consistently focused on the characters and set to an emotionally rousing score by Rupert Gregson Williams (Legend of Tarzan), will please the typical blockbuster fan. <br/><br/>For those who love the deeper more thematically complex cinematic offerings, you will not be disappointed by the themes explored in this move. And as a refreshing surprise, WONDER WOMAN features what I can unabashedly say is the most genuine and well written romance in a comic book movie, ever.<br/><br/>Truly wonderful."

You get the same truly intelligent respect for the source material, while not being afraid to move things around so that the character can have more of a realistic root to the world (Richard Donner used the term ""Verisimilitude!"") and the myth that helped create the story. <br/><br/>By the end, I had zero doubt that Wonder Woman was protector of the Earth.<br/><br/>This film is a truly entertaining superhero romp featuring a character that stands as one of the pillars of comic book lore. We finally have the Wonder Woman we deserve."

You not only felt attached to the characters, but you felt that any of them could die and that fact kept you on your feet while watching the movie. However, it wasn't all intensity. Perfectly timed jokes, humor, and more filled the movie with brightness and it was really great to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, one of the greatest super hero movies of all time.

Gal Gadot plays Diana, the Amazon Princess, Chris Pine (you may remember from Star Trek) is Steve Taylor, Robin Wright (from House of Cards) plays Antiope, and Connie Nielsen is Hippolyta, the Queen of the Amazons and Diana's mother. <br/><br/>The story is played as a flashback, in which the present day Diana Prince meditates on a photograph of herself with a group of men taken during the Great War of 1914-1918. It tells the background to the whole story, which involves a struggle of the gods between Zeus and Ares: Ares prevails but Zeus manages to leave a weapon to be used by the Amazon warriors when the time should come. Well, guess what, the time has come. With the prelude out of the way, the main story gets underway with the appearance of Taylor whose place crashes just off the island of Themiscyra. He brings news of the Great War currently being waged and the dreadful slaughter going on. Since the Amazons' very purpose is to bring peace and justice, Diana argues that they have a duty to take part, but Hippolyta forbids it. Diana defies the Queen and escapes, taking what she believes to be the weapons Zeus devised to be used for her purpose. Diana and Taylor head for London where they deliver vital information concerning the development of poison gas which will lead to millions more deaths and prolong the warfare. This time Taylor is forbidden from taking any further action, but he defies his orders. The pair go to war in Belgium along with a small groups of misfits – the scenario reminds me very much of the Guns of Navarone. They deliver a small Belgian village from their occupying force, but soon after the village itself is destroyed in a gas attack. Diana realizes that Ares, her ancient nemesis, is behind all this and defeats him in a final battle. <br/><br/>There are some quite humorous scenes of Diana trying to figure out how to fit into life in the wider world, but the general anti-war message is far more important, indeed sometimes the movie gets rather repetitive about the horrors of modern warfare. Diana demonstrates the positive value of standing up for the weak and powerless against a brutal and oppressive power, and shows compassion for those who are weak. It is interesting to watch her development from one who is idealistic and slightly naive – she thinks that if she destroys Ares that the war will end, while Taylor claims that the problem is in the hearts of men who are too willing to use force for their own gain, who employ whatever means Ares may place in their hands. <br/><br/>There is certainly plenty of fighting and lots of loud booming explosions. At times I felt that the fight scenes looked pretty much like something out of X-Men or the recent Batman / Superman movies, whose genre they share. Diana's special gadgets – her armlets, shield and whip – are all principally defensive weapons rather that offensive, but her style of doing battle was not really all that different from that of the men around her. <br/><br/>All in all though, it was very good to see a strong, self-confident central female character who drives the action throughout the movie. I recommend all men to bring their wives and daughters to see this movie, to introduce them to a new kind of feminism. The line that sums it all up for me is : ""It's about what you believe. And I believe in love. Only love will truly save the world."""

","I just watched it tonight and I am probably going to watch it next week as well but in 4DX cause, I think it will be amazing!! While I was watching it, I was so into it which made me realise that it took the crown of favourite origins story from Iron Man for me. It was amazing. I also understand why she was different than the Diana from Dawn of Justice, and the difference is amazing!! As you can see from the title, this movie is definitely up there with the Dark Knight Trilogy movies! Great acting, in my opinion, awesome visuals and an AMAZING soundtrack!! I am so glad it could give the chance to more women directors to direct a Blockbuster! An AWESOME Job from director Patty Jenkins, she deffo deserves the new record she broke. All of my friends who were with me loved it as well which says a lot because we usually disagree on the smallest details about the movies we watch. Go watch it people, give it a chance and it will amaze you! Enjoy! Keep up the good work DC and WB! Amazing job on this movie!!"
"bankofmarquis","8","5","12","5 June 2017"," DC finally gets it right!
","We can all exhale, DC finally got a movie right.<br/><br/>WONDER WOMAN is the DC movie that we have been waiting for.  It has it all - a good cast, good action, pathos, high stakes and - ready for this? - humor!  With a central character that is easy to root for and real chemistry between the two leads, this film is entertaining from start to finish.<br/><br/>Director Patty Jenkins hits a home run with this one and nearly avoids almost all of the traps of a Comic Book SuperHero Origin film - almost.  The biggest issue I had with this film is the first 1/2 hour, the time that Wonder Woman grows up on the hidden island with the Amazon women.  Young Diana is precocious and inquisitive and is raised to be a warrior by her Queen Mother, Hippolyta (a serviceable Connie Nielsen) and her Warrior Aunt, Antiope (an interestingly cast Robin Wright).  This part of the film was a pretty ""by-the-books"" origin film and is fine, but not more than that.  However, this film picks up speed when Chris Pine's spy/pilot, Steve Trevor, crashes onto the scene.<br/><br/>If you wonder if there is such a thing as film chemistry, check out the scenes, banter and verbal sparring being Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot - more on her later) and Pine.  The screen crackles when these two are together and I really, really wanted them to get together and loved spending 2 hours with them.  Chris Pine is a ""no doubt"" movie star, commanding the screen with charisma, charm and poise.<br/><br/>But Gadot's Diana Prince is his equal in every way.  The biggest concern I had about this film was whether Gadot could fill the screen for a full film, after being the best thing (by far) in the BATMAN V SUPERMAN film of last year.  My fears were calmed as Gadot was able to hold this film together as her Diana Prince was fierce, vulnerable, funny, sad, charming and confused - often at the same time.  She really has captured this role - and the film - and is the main reason that it is so strong.<br/><br/>Director Jenkins and screenplay writer Allan Heinberg populate this world with rich, muted tones, representing the WWI setting of the story while populating this world with interesting supporting characters - mostly the ragtag group that Pine's Trevor recruits to help Wonder Woman complete her task.  Said Taghmaoui (Sameer), Ewen Bremmer (Charlie) and Eugene Brave Rock (The Chief) were welcome companions on this journey - as were Lucy Davis as Trevor's ass't, Etta and good ol' David Thewlis who chewed the scenery very well as Sir Patrick.  The only actor who did not fair well was Danny Huston as the main villain - a bit cartoonish and one dimensional.  But, of course, this is a comic book film, so I guess I should not have expected more.<br/><br/>As for the action - Jenkins direction was revelatory to me - her choreographing of the action was solid, simple and well thought out.  When Diana Prince finally rises to the occasion as WonderWoman - in a thrilling sequence right in the middle of the film - I was grinning from ear to ear and was cheering her on.  It was the uplifting, positive SuperHero moment that the dour DC films have been missing.  I hope they learn to keep that up for the next installment in this Universe - JUSTICE LEAGUE.<br/><br/>But, if not, I look forward to WONDER WOMAN 2!<br/><br/>Letter Grade A-<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
"stevendbeard","8","5","12","2 June 2017"," DC Got It Right!
","I saw ""Wonder Woman"", starring Gal Gadot-Keeping Up With the Joneses, the Fast & the Furious movies; Chris Pine-The New Star Trek movies, Into the Woods; Robin Wright-Moneyball, Forrest Gump; Danny Huston-Big Eyes, Clash of the Titans_2010 and David Thewlis-Red 2, the Harry Potter movies.<br/><br/>This is the first female starring superhero film that is directed by a woman, Patty Jenkins, who directed Monster-and before you get your panties all knotted up, I said directed by a woman, because there have been female superhero movies before. Gal plays Princess Diana of Themyscira, home of the Amazons. If you remember her debut in the not as good Batman vs. Superman, this movie starts in the present time as she gets the photograph from Bruce Wayne of her that was taken during WW1. The majority of the movie is a flashback telling the story behind the picture, plus her origin, too, of course. Robin plays Gal's Amazon aunt that helps train Gal in the finer points of being a warrior. These training sessions and other battle scenes are unbelievably athletic and graceful and there is a lot of humor throughout the movie, too. Chris plays Steve Trevor, a British spy that crash lands right off the coast of Themyscira during a top secret mission. Gal saves him from drowning and discovers the horrors of war in the outside world. She travels back with Chris and when she comes face to face with a certain Nazi officer, Danny, she believes Danny is actually the God of War, Ares, in disguise. David plays a British commander that helps Chris on his and Gal's mission to end the war and restore peace. DC has not had the track record of good movies like Marvel has but I think they got it right on this one. FYI: I heard a rumor-before seeing the movie-that Linda Carter would make a cameo appearance, but she did not show up. It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence and sexual content-partial nudity and before you get too excited, it was of Chris, not Gal-and has a running time of 2 hours & 21 minutes. I really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"Gordon-11","Null","5","12","1 June 2017"," Enjoyable
","This film tells the story of a British spy, who is saved by a princess on an island with only female warriors. Together they fight against evil forces drives the great war, hoping to stop the war and save innocent lives.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" is a fantasy tale, telling how a super heroine stops the great war by personally going to the front and fight. I find Gal Gadot very apt as the heroine. She is attractive but still has a fierce and formidable feel to her. The story is a little slow, and it could be edited down by a lot especially in the beginning of the film. The romance subplot distracts rather than adds, but that's just my opinion. There is a good climax, which I think is too short. It could have been lengthened and still remains thrilling."
"awomble02","10","7","19","2 July 2017"," Great Film!
","Wonder Woman shows us that the DC Extended Universe finally can be a match to Marvel after a series of forgettable movies. <br/><br/>The Story is great! Acting is fantastic! Gal Gadot and Chris Pine steal the show and make it thoroughly enjoyable. Special Effects are impressive (reminds me of 300), nice soundtrack and great direction (Well done Patty Jenkins). The use of colour throughout the film was good at creating the right tone. Would highly recommend this movie, any review below a 6 is just hating on the film. GO AND SEE IT!"

","First of all, I tip my hat and give a salute to Gal Gadot, my sister in arms. OK, with that been say, some may say that it bias. It is what it is, but you can not deny the box office numbers, like it or not it is what it is and it did what it did, even still doing. Awesome movie from opening to closing. Very entertaining solid story line, and yes if you didn't know the history of her existence you got a glimpse of it from the movie, but(yes there is a but) it is far more deeper than what's in the movie. Do your research, and not just pulling from the movie script. Straight from the Side Bar Review. The movie save the summer blockbuster openings. The only disappointing thing about this movie is the fact all that it did in 1 week of opening worldwide. She got robbed! Gal Gadot, got paid far less then her male counter part actors that did less not even coming close to what Wonder Woman did in it opening. Nevertheless, she killed it while she made the statement about female super heroes. Love Marvel, but DC nailed it with Wonder Woman. Awesome movie, a wonder woman with a super bang!"

Gal Gabot was just stunning and of course there's the ever dreamy Chris Pine who I crave for. This film is going to be talked about for a very long time not just because it's a female directed movie but it can shine a light for many female directors and artists such as myself to have doors open in the industry."

"drrussfuller","10","7","19","16 June 2017"," A beautiful vision
","Although this film has received terrific reviews, it still seems that the director's vision is not sufficiently appreciated. Wonder woman is not just a wonderfully entertaining film; it also provides a new and beautiful vision of gender relations in America. The Feminist movement went completely off the rails when Gloria Steinem and her ilk began judging women who wanted to be housewives and mothers. The so-called men's movement sputtered and died almost before it began. The relationship between Chris Pine and Gal Gadot gives us a vision of relationships that honors both the feminine and the masculine. This vision takes us beyond the petty power struggles that destroy the vast majority of relationships in America. It is a relationship in which each person shows up with all of their passion, their presence, and their gifts. No one is diminished. Thank you, Patty, for such a wonderful vision."

","Wonder Woman <br/><br/><ul><li>Patty Jenkins When Zack Snyder made ""Man of Steel"" in 2013, he had laid the groundwork for a bunch of DC movies to come the following years. Although the reception was bad for ""Batman vs Superman"", I liked it very much. Zack Snyder has done a pretty good job. But, Wonder Woman is the DC movie that everybody could comprehend and accept, which is not brooding and polarizing like the other movies.</li></ul><br/><br/>Wonder Woman is the movie that all loved and even the critics couldn't find flaws with it, Yes, the movie is flawless and has every elements that a Superhero movie needs.<br/><br/>Focusing on the origin of the Amazon Goddess, right from the beginning the movie captures the attention of the audience. It shows how Diana adapts to the human world and how Diana became the Wonder Woman.The screenplay and cinematography enhances the perfection with which Patty Jenkins has directed the movie.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is the perfect Wonder Woman( not that Lynda Carter was bad), she has carried the whole thing on in spite of being 5 months pregnant, massive respect. Chris Pine was the best counter-part, although we had our doubts initially that he couldn't do any other role as good as James.T.Kirk in Star Trek. Kudos to the casting as every character has been used well and has a certain trait that is seen distinctively.<br/><br/>Every dialogue in the movie had a deeper meaning and nothing was to fill the conversations. The movie had its light moments, opposed to how dark DC movies will be and it wasn't void of serious moments either. Just the theme music was enough to give goosebumps and it was beautifully shown how humans were seen from Diana's point of view and she still chose to help 'em.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but notice how Wonder Woman was little parallel to Captain Steve Rogers with both carrying shields and having their time line from World War II to the present. Still no Marvel movie can come close to this SOLO female Superhero. We have all the rights to hope that the Justice League movie is going to be awesome.<br/><br/>The movie is worth a lot of re-watches and did somebody notice Zack Snyder's cameo in the trenches? Neither did I."

","Gal Gadot... the newest female super hero that all girls can look up to. Playing the iconic Princess Diana of Themyscira who grows up without ever knowing what war is all about or for that matter... who man is. With ever present warriors surrounding her Diana comes to witness the first trespasser Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) after crashing into the ocean to which Diana then rescues. Learning about the outside world which is at war with itself Diana comes to the realization that Aries is the one to blame.<br/><br/>Teamed up with a motley crew of misfit mercenaries Steve, Diana, and his mates take it upon themselves to stopping a cruel, and sadistic general who is about unleash with the help of his psychotic chemist Isabel Maru (Elena Anaya) a highly toxic form of Mustard gas more powerful than the original predecessor during its use in WW1. Between a rock, and a hard place Diana soon discovers that man or woman is not what the tales of old were describing humans as just a simple peaceful race. Like an innocent child she is exposed to the real truth of what or how or why humans war with one another whether Aries had a hand in it or not.<br/><br/>Choosing a resolve Diana then relinquishes her status from her homeland to live among us. Watching, waiting for us to make a mistake with dreadful consequences just so that Wonder Woman can set things right with her brand of justice, fortitude, and determination to keep the earth safe from itself. I found Gal Gadot the right choice for the role. She has the audacious mannerisms found from inside the comic version. From childhood on up to her adult life learning more each day as she continues to thrive. Chris pine was an excellent pick as Steve Trevor because of his witty banter, and obvious charms in the midst of disaster one after another. The music was top notch, as was the action along with the human emotion that brewed between Diana, and Steve.<br/><br/>Fans from around the world will love this film for its newly revamped Super hero bringing us closer to the brink of the ultimate movie... hopefully to be released in the future. The Justice League. I highly recommend this film for ages of ten and above. Great fun, laughs, heartache, and wonderful story line."
"ssingh-50552","3","7","19","5 June 2017"," Not at all wonderful!!
","I usually don't write reviews but seeing the hype going around this movie and finding nothing in the movie to make me feel it is worth all the praise, I decided to give my 2 cents on this movie. Superhero movies now-a-days are the thing to be in. Everybody loves them, and they earn well. That said I think they are becoming increasingly predictive and mind-numbing boring. I know mine is not the popular opinion out there but this movie enters my long list of over hyped superhero movies.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman starts of with us being introduced to the world of Amazons and their home Themyscira. I have to say I was pretty thrilled till the first half hour. But that is when the movie starts to go down. The story moves at a snail's pace with some humor in the form of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) and his secretary. Diana's introduction to the human world makes up for some funny moments which after a point seem forced. Although I do give credit to Patty Jenkins for capturing the naivety of Diana perfectly. The second act sees Diana and Steve going to the front which seems to take forever. In between they pick up three mercenaries who apart from providing some comedic relief don't do much. The third act gives us some much awaited action sequences which I must say have been very well done. Although, the final showdown, just like the previous DC movies comes as a letdown considering the preceding action sequences. Also, the ending king of ruined the effect of the movie for me (you have to see it to know).<br/><br/>In all, Wonder Woman delivers on a lot of fronts. Action sequences have been well choreographed, acting was decent (except some cringe-worthy moments from Gal Gadot), and the comedic tone was also there. But the long running time makes the movie boring and thinking back I can surely say that some scenes shouldn't have been there. The movie does provide some powerful moments towards the end, but by then you are wondering if this was worth all that came before. Also, the ending... aaaarghhhhh. <br/><br/>I guess too many superhero movies have done what Wonder Woman tried to do, thus nothing really stands out. Except, obviously the fact that this is the first female superhero feature film."
"bhavandeepsingh","5","7","19","5 June 2017"," Disappointing
","Weak Story, Weak Cast, even worse supporting characters 20 mins of special effects, 2 hours of cringe-inducing dialogue, Diana - our Juvenile protagonist who is willing to kill someone solely based on what her mother has told her instead of finding out the truth herself. The male protagonist is somewhat sane. The supporting characters are severely cliché and generic having NO performing role in the movie. The German facilities they are breaching seem to be guarded by a handful of soldiers - its borderline laughable how easily Wonder Woman and her band of muppets are able to overcome a key German Officer.<br/><br/>The movie suffers from overbearing cringy dialogue, some special effects and a story that you won't notice beginning and ending. <br/><br/>Skip this crap."
"TheFearmakers","6","7","19","4 June 2017"," An Overrated yet Pretty Decent Ride
","First things first, and not to be shallow... although both male and female will readily admit that Gal Gadot is, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful women ever filmed... <br/><br/>Which makes perfect sense in the WONDER WOMAN origin story because — she's no ordinary dame. Even living on an island with a race of Amazon beauties, who spend their long days practice-fighting in a slow-motion MATRIX style fashion, she stands out and alone — the only vixen with powers far beyond her kind. Superpowers, indeed...<br/><br/>Gadot's Diana is a lot like.... get ready for this utterly random comparison... Arnold Schwarzenegger in TWINS: Brought up on an island paradise as an impeccable human being, and then some, it takes a mortal... in this case, World War I American Spy/Flying Ace Chris Pine as Steve Trevor... to teach her about humanity and its multitude of flaws... <br/><br/>The action scenes, continuing the MATRIX style slow-mo... bullets moving like flying snails along with people being rammed at high speed, and then pummeling fifty yards backward... are perpetually in-check with an anti-war message that quite simply — gets in the way: Of not only thrills but the story-line...<br/><br/>Instead of fully developing the characters around Diana as she follows Steve onto the Front Lines, where she thinks the God of War exists in this ""War to End All Wars"" while meeting three of his forgettable buddies, there's a barrage of lectures spouting from our title heroine — not the typical Hollywood-preachy but more like an unscathed child to an experienced father. Her naiveté obviously masks what the writers are trying to say about mankind (there's even a hackneyed, forced reminder of how bad the Native Americans had it), while Chris Pine, despite looking good for the part and great as Captain Kirk in the new STAR TREK franchise, isn't witty or caustic enough to make for a stunned semi-straight-man for this surreal woman's bizarre reality...<br/><br/>For instance: On a boat, after leaving her island (near where Steve had crash- landed with Germans on his tail), Diana tells him she's not only fatherless, but was made of clay by her mother. Setting up for the type of stunned disbelief that could be downright hilarious, he hardly seems to care much at all. Not that every superhero movie-character should have a Robert Downey Jr. rapid-fire wit... <br/><br/>But since this WONDER WOMAN is so outrageously gorgeous and mysterious, wielding powers straight from the gods, a more humorous and realistic sense of comparably inferior Reaction is very much needed. Then again, the two do click, visually. And the flaws are partially made up for by an adventure that takes the viewer into several locations where, to quote the old pulp radio shows, Danger lurks around every corner... <br/><br/>How Diana takes on the human menace i.e. German troops makes for a genuinely entertaining roller-coaster. Too bad the people around this stunning goddess can't equal her powers with the kind of earthy charisma that makes her battles worth fighting. And like the first CAPTAIN America, having a superhero movie take place in the historic past makes for villains that feel tacked-on, unrealistic and, for the most part, unnecessary. In either World War I or II, while up against the massive German army, a primary Antagonist adds up to a sprinkler in the ocean. Sure, they're needed to move the story, and this is a comic book tale. But in WONDER WOMAN, the enemies are a mere afterthought. But hey, on the lighter side, this time the folks at DC lessened their narcissistic whining and brooding, going all out to please the audience: most of whom will ignore any faults and simply enjoy the ride. And with the price of admission so high, why the hell not? (CultFilmFreaks.com)"

","Walking out of Wonder Woman, my husband and I instantly thought about how much our sons and granddaughters would like this movie. Although its creators playfully and conveniently mix Greek and Roman mythologies (names of Diana paired with Zeus and Ares, for example, and Ares rather than Apollo--who's not in the movie--laying claim to divine truthiness), the plot more than works and holds together logically. There is no foul language. In the Greek tradition, goriness is not shown ""on the stage."" The audience realizes that people have been decapitated, impaled, etc., but the gore is not shown, so girls will not run from the theater and boys will not get aroused by the wrong stuff. <br/><br/>Diana is not a sexualized hero although she and the leading man are certainly sexual beings in the best and modest senses. Fighting is like the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon sort, though not quite so ""Ninja."" A special effects Oscar is a definite probably. <br/><br/>And the acting is SO good despite the fantasy element. The hero is like a combo of Pitt, Damon, and DiCaprio in their youth. The Amazonian accents are a little disarming, but since all the Amazons are supposedly polyglots, it's okay. And they do sound a little Israeli like the leading lady.<br/><br/>This is a funny, laugh-out-loud script. The ending is inevitable since the script is honest and intelligent. <br/><br/>I haven't really liked an action movie since The Fugitive, but this one I loved!"

","Normally, I do not write reviews, ever. However, in the case of WW, this movie truly deserves my time to reflect on. The script, actors, and scenes of the movie all flowed flawlessly together, leaving the spectator to truly respect what was presented on screen. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine as well as the supporting cast were excellent. What DC, Snyder, and Jenkins did was phenomenal. I will not spoil if for anyone, as far as the action sequences and general story/plot, however, I will elaborate on how powerful the views that were expressed in the movie. WW is a movie that truly shows the audience why fighting for the little guy, and why truth, honesty, and integrity are so important in life. To me, this movie teaches people why empathy and consideration as well as willing to put someone else first before yourself can really change things. Bravo DC, you have definitely set a new bar in superhero movies."

You will not be dead if you dont watch it. You will not miss any tremendous thing in your life if you dont go for this crap. Dont waste your time. No focus on story but Too much focus on Diana's looks. Forgettable supporting cast and a dumb CGI. Irritating Relentless Slo-Mo. No memorable Villain. and in my opinion the important lack is To this day, World War I is viewed by historians as an immensely complex and misunderstood period in history, and as such it's a hugely controversial subject.<br/><br/>So whilst Wonder Woman should be admired for its willingness to set the action in and amongst the horrors of The Great War, a territory that most action films these days - especially superhero movies - would be eager to steer clear of, it does ultimately end up feeling like something of a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>There were no clear bad guys in World War I, after all; no easy-to-hate Nazis to fight, like in the far more clear-cut conflict that was World War II. But the complex nature of the war isn't really explored: the Germans are still painted as pretty generic bad guys, and there's no attempt in the movie to explore the war as anything other than a ""setting."" It serves as an aesthetic, when it could have been a whole lot more In total, lost of loops. Don't go for it.
Its Truly disappointment."

Another golden rule of screenwriting is that the protagonist MUST have weaknesses...Wonder Woman is apparently a Goddess with none. It follows that I did not care for any single one of the characters. I could go on all day about all the things wrong but then again this movie has already wasted enough of my time."

"kellerae","9","8","23","8 June 2017"," Absolutely incredible
","I was getting really tired of superhero movies, and DC has had such a weak start. BvS and Suicide Squad was a really depressing portfolio thus far, but Wonder Woman has crushed it, and it feels like an apology for the aforementioned titles. This truly feels like the start of DCEU, and it is so so special.<br/><br/>It also includes the satisfying destruction of many harmful stereotypes and tropes found within the genre as well. This alone was enough for me, but it didn't stop there.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot was totally relentless. She had the perfect amount of energy and drive to be Wonder Woman. I love how her character has been built. With a satisfying transition from BvS to Wonder Woman, we get to see how she has grown with time and experience, which is so crucial for a superhero movie to be realistic and relatable.<br/><br/>It was such a fun addition as well, it's hard to make me laugh out loud in a theater and they did it. Aside from just that, now I have incredibly high hopes for Justice League (which, hopefully, won't be a mistake). I feel like DCEU will soon be a better competitor for the MCU with more successful movies moving in the same direction and the same velocity as Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>I couldn't be happier. All my childhood wishes have been granted. It has been a long time since I have waited many years for something and not been disappointed. If you wasted your ""redemption shot"" on Suicide Squad after seeing BvS, please, reassess your choices and get into this hype."

Last year, I was a 9 grade student when I watched WW. So apparently, it was a great discover of my life. People do things, right or wrong, what they believe. DC and Marvel fans, Messi and Ronaldo fans, every religion, political party, atheist and theist ... they always fight each other, try to establish their own beliefs. Somehow I realized that, they all are right in their own places. You can throw a lot of strong logics but only that one is right which you believe.

I'd reached the point of swearing off watching anything from either Marvel or DC, which has also been infected, albeit to a slightly lesser extent, with the leftist Virus which is simultaneously attacking all elements of American society, values and culture. Although this movie was released in 2017, I have avoided viewing it, and all other offerings from the cinematic super-hero world until just now (July 8th, 2018). I finally broke my promise to myself at the fervent behest of a dear friend who assured me that THIS movie would restore my faith and hope!
 Well, I'm here to tell you that, in my opinion, THIS movie is unarguably and without question the ABSOLUTE BEST I have seen-from EITHER brand!!! From the acting, to the plot line, characterizations, dramatic depth, and it's ability to draw the viewer in and deeply care....I cannot remember a movie of this genre with more going for it than this one!!! Gal Gadot was BORN to be Wonder Woman! The direction, editing, CGI and all other production values are off-the-charts STELLAR in quality!!! In terms of overall greatness, this leaves every single Marvel offering-including the entire Avenger-related and the pathetically pandering Black Panther ""wanna-be"" franchises IN THE DUST!

"antoniokowatsch","6","3","6","19 May 2018"," An over-hyped movie, much too predictable:
","I really don't understand all the hype that surrounds this particular movie. I had pretty high expectations for it and was quite disappointed when I actually got to see it. The only good thing that the movie had going for it was the film score and the cinematography. But if you look at the story line the movie is extremely one-dimensional. There is no real plot and almost no character development, literally. So, there's not much substance to all these high praises that this movie managed to accumulate. It seems. <br/><br/>But just to be perfectly clear about it; this movie felt like feminist propaganda. And when I'm saying feminist I'm not referring to the textbook definition of feminism but rather the now established cult of man-hating individuals. As an egalitarian I can totally get behind the ""third wave of feminism"", which has very little in common with today's feminism. But I digress. The reason why I believe this to be the aforementioned type of propaganda is pretty simple to deduce; the protagonist is female, morally superior and virtually invincible (at no point during the movie was the life of the protagonist in any real danger*). Meanwhile all the men are portrayed as ""horny"", dumb, ""needlessly"" violent, expendable, and anything but virtuous. With the sole exception of the other protagonist (aka the ""crashed pilot"") who I'd dare to call a ""token man"" because of what fate awaits him during the end segment of the movie. I don't know about you but I call this very bad story telling. Ideally one should try to make every character just a little bit flawed (even the protagonist), otherwise the whole story just feels like literal propaganda. The writers intent clearly bleeds into the script in this particular case. One would have to be blind to not see that.<br/><br/>just to elaborate on the point that I made earlier: the protagonist was never in any situation that one could describe as ""dangerous"". She was clearly overpowered, and just to take the point home; the movie literally starts out with a scene from the end segment of another movie ""Batman Vs Superman"", which literally tells us that no matter what happens in this movie, at the end she'll make it out alive with a memento of a war (the photo). So that scene right there pretty much summarizes half of the movie, no pun intended. <br/><br/>To conclude: I feel really saddened. Not by the fact that the movie was rather mediocre but by the fact that most people don't even realize it. That's the real tragedy.<br/><br/>Final verdict: watchable, but don't believe the hype. It's not ""that"" good."

Somebody said it's a rip off of Captain America, but I still cannot decide which one is worst. Maybe both are. I remember the main critics towards Jupiter Ascending was that the female character was weak. If Wonder Woman is a strong female character, I'm speechless. Because it's arguable that WW was even the main character of this movie, to me she looked more like a pretty background face. Anyway, I highly recommend people not to watch this movie. And I'm ashamed I fell victim of the Hollywood blockbuster scam."
"edithp-37476","1","6","16","30 August 2017"," Script doctor.
","1: Lighten up on the inspirational music. I thought I was watching a car advertisement, I really did. <br/><br/>2: Multi-faceted characters. All the characters in this movie are one-dimensional and none of them has any appreciable arc. Chris Pine's character starts off a heroic good guy, he ends up a heroic good guy. Same with Gal Gadot. How about you introduce a little tension and misunderstanding between Gadot and Pine early on? Make him more of an ambiguous character, a rough diamond who is generally decent but makes some selfish decisions, which Gadot disapproves of. She can be more haughty, high-minded and judgmental early on, believing in her own righteousness and thinking he is a scoundrel. As the movie goes on, Gadot discovers her own flaws but makes Pine want to become a better man. This makes the end scene more touching, as her influence over him has completed his arc, he makes a huge sacrifice because he believes in her and she in turn learns that people can be both bad and good, but are better when they have someone to admire. Her arc is similarly completed when she learns that she is not perfect, that she too is flawed, just like the people she previously looked down on.<br/><br/>3: Morality: The morality of this film is disturbing to say the least. Wonder Woman goes around murdering ordinary working class German men because they happen to be unfortunate enough to be conscripted into the wrong army, at the wrong time. But at the end of the film she spares the life of a truly evil, genocidal torturer - who deserves to die by anyone's reckoning. Pity is indeed a noble and important human attribute, but where was her pity for the ordinary working class men she murdered? Why does she feel pity for a genocidal maniac who deserves to die? How about instead of having her kill ordinary working class men who were just conscripted at the wrong time and in the wrong place, she shows them pity and mercy, and kills the genocidal torturer? Why make the message of the film that people are both good and bad, but have everyone hugging once Ares dies, as if they were all under a spell? The morality of this film is all over the place. If everyone hugs once Ares dies, just kill Ares and don't kill his unfortunate minions. Were they under a spell, or weren't they?<br/><br/>4. Ditch the theme music. Seriously; it's totally at odds with the character you're trying to represent. The director has chosen to make the main character a pure and inspirational goddess, but allowed her to be represented by the raunchy, aggressive theme music of an angry stripper on PCP. I get that the theme tune was composed for a different movie, under a different director, but does anyone else involved with the debacle? Leave the theme tune to the end credits, if you have to use it at all.<br/><br/>5. Don't have the Amazons fight like they have no clue about war. They have bows, they have the high ground, why did they jump off the cliffs only to get slaughtered on the beach? It doesn't matter how much technology advances in warfare, you don't give up the high ground, especially to an unknown enemy. By doing so, it undoes all the early work of the film which portrays them as fierce and capable warriors and makes them look like silly girls playing games. If you need to have a scene in which people are dying and Wonder Woman gets to both show off her fighting skills and be tragically rescued, make it an ambush. Watching the Amazons fling themselves from the cliffs was one of the most ridiculous things I've seen in a movie, almost as bad as the time James Bond surfed a tidal wave and equally cringe-worthy. Have them ambushed by the soldiers, you can have the same result with far more credibility and emotional resonance. It's difficult to feel too sorry for people who fling themselves off cliffs, shooting grappling arrows, only to Tarzan into a 8.22 mm round fired by a man with probably a fortnight's basic training. These women came across more Cirque Du Soleil than Amazon warrior, but on the plus side; if their island ever sinks under rising tides caused by global warming, they've got a steady career in Vegas just waiting for them. Three shows a day and all the shrimp they can eat. Yum.<br/><br/>6. The sidekicks were a confused mess. I'm not against the idea of having a disparate group of mercenaries all fighting for various things with ambiguous morality, in fact it was quite a good idea to teach Diana the nuance of human relationships and interactions. That said, the characters were poorly-fleshed out and didn't really serve much purpose. It felt like the director couldn't decide whether they wanted comedy sidekicks, or Saving Private Ryan type tragic soldiers, and so chose the former, but scripted the latter. What we ended up with was comedy sidekicks without the comedy, which was the worst of all worlds. My solution to this is simple, don't try to make them all individual characters with poorly thought out back-stories, that don't come to anything (like the sniper who couldn't shoot) - let them fulfill their destinies as comedy-sidekicks who make the audience laugh. You can still add serious moments, like when the Native American is talking about how his land was stolen by Chris Pine's people and Diana's criticism of his mercenary actions suddenly rings childish and hollow. That was a great moment, probably the best in the film in fact. By interspersing comedy banter with serious moments like those, you can created a much more powerful effect than by explicitly giving every one of them a tragic backstory, but never exploring it beyond hearing them complain a bit because you think it gives your movie substance."

I remember watching it through until both WW and Chris pine left for London and somehow I kinda lost it from there. The movie somehow didn't interest me anymore and it was more like slogging through and let time past by. When it's no longer interesting, your mind wanders off and thinking what you had eaten before coming in the theater. So, enough of my rambling, I'm just going to give a 4/10, why 4? because Chris Pine did a good job for his part and I am not into Ms. Gadot style of acting ever since BvS and that movie was also uninteresting for me. This is just my personal opinion. However, I definitely could watch DC animation movies though. Until this day, I still love WW & Big Barda fight scenes against the Furies & Granny Goodness.

DC finally learned to make movies not too boring like they always do. The content was great and the mist interesting part of the movie was the action scenes. Sick and cool. The action scenes is one of the best on the planet.

"greggs_nbacon","8","6","16","28 June 2017"," A solid entry in the DCEU...for once
","(Originally posted from confessionsofasavagemind.blogspot.com)<br/><br/>The DC Comics Extended Universe of films has been so an abysmal drag as a film goer. Man of Steel was all style and no substance, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice was a dull snoozefest, while Suicide Squad was the cinematic equivalent of injecting liquid Lucky Charms into your brain. However, I am here to say that DC and Warner Brothers has finally produced a good movie to their resume. That comes in the form of Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Earlier this summer, I was very cynical about Wonder Woman's chances of being successful at all. I predicted it could be one of the biggest flops of this year. In hindsight, I will admit that my view might have been slightly misogynistic. In all fairness though, there has never been a movie with this kind of budget not only centered around a woman but directed by a woman. The studio system has forever sold us, the moviegoer, the idea that a film directed or about women cannot be a box office success. That being said, the ideology needs to change to a film can be a box office success no matter what the topic or who directs it, as long as the film is well made. Wonder Woman has proved this to me and should be noted for its cinematic achievement.<br/><br/>Now, after the praise, I will say one thing: Wonder Woman is a good movie. Not a great movie, but a good one. I think that the film has gotten grossly over-hyped because of how amazing it is in comparison to the other DC films. It's like comparing a tortilla to moldy bread. There's nothing wrong with the tortilla, but it's a hell of a lot better than some moldy bread. I don't hate the film for the exact template of generic superhero movies (one that was perfected by Marvel) It succeeds at being a solid entity. The film also does a better job of selling its themes of the morality of war and the nature of humanity far better than most Marvel movies. It is to be noted that even though the film had three story credits, Allan Heinberg is the only credited writer for the screenplay. As many of these big budget films go, there are several ideas on how the film should go. The studio then gets several screenwriters to write several different screenplays. The studio then takes the best parts of each screenplay and then creates Frankenstein's monster out of the remains. So it was to my surprise when the story was actually cohesive and well thought out. The film is not only a good superhero film but a good war film. Director Patty Jenkins adds the proper feminine touch that is so needed in gritty war films, as Kathryn Bigelow proved in The Hurt Locker. One problem that arose for me in the film is the lack of consequence of the violence of war. Yes, some disturbing images were shown in the film to try and get this point across, but the lack of bloodshed I found disturbing. There is a theory that young people who kill because of what they have seen in the movies would understand the severity of using guns. Some movies such as Deadpool and Logan have proved that violence can work in blockbusters, so why would Wonder Woman avoid it?<br/><br/>In terms of performances, I thought the show was completely stolen by Gal Gadot. When Gadot was chosen for the role, I was entirely unsure if she could overcome her looks to give good performances. After all, many performers whose physiques are aesthetically pleasing rest on the laurels of their looks far too often. Gadot proves this through the absolute charm and wit she shows with a combined sense of naivety and strength exuded in her performance. Chris Pine did actually well considering he has always reminded me in looks and performances of one of the puppets from Team America: World Police. The current superhero films are still lacking some truly great contemporary villains, however, and I am disappointed again by Wonder Woman. No other performances particularly enamored me, as my eyesight was always drawn to Gadot the entire length of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Wonder Woman hits every note it needs to hit with strength, poise, and grace. It is truly a crime that this film was director Patty Jenkins first film since she wowed audiences with her horrific biopic Monster. Jenkins puts out a strong case against industry sexism while producing a solid superhero film.<br/><br/>Grade: (8/10)"

","Loved it. Gal Gadot is AMAZING. She is quite stunning, and not just on the outside. She plays this part with all the honor and truth that it deserves. The role shows how much more pure humankind and the world could be if we just let go of the ignorance that clouds our judgment, and Gal executed it perfectly so I give it a perfect 10. I also loved how the issue of sexual attraction was handled - very enlightened and classy. Loved that men's ""intelligence"" illustrated in the fears of 'risk' and the strength of the enemy was not ascribed to by Diana and therefore eliminated the barriers to her courage; like we face every day. Much of what stops us from doing what we truly want to do comes from fear. She was FEARLESS. Worth every penny and every minute. Take your daughters, and don't leave it in the theater. <3"

","As a child my favorite super hero growing up was Wonder Woman. You can imagine my excitement when it was announced that Wonder Woman was getting her own movie. However, with the recent failures of the DC franchise in the past, I was very skeptical when going to see the movie. Out of loyalty for my love of super hero movie, I watched it regardless. Before the movie I could only think of what DC did with Batman and Superman (or more specifically everything they didn't do but should have done). My fear was that Wonder Woman would fall the same way. <br/><br/>To my surprise, Wonder Woman was an amazing film. My hopes for the movie is that it would give rise and attention to the power young girls can look up to and eventually have. Clearly they cannot have super powers, but they can surely finally have someone to look up to who's like them, a female. I of course wanted the movie to be successful in other ways as well, as it was suppose to be the movie to save DC so to speak. Wonder Woman delivered and surpassed all expectations. The film itself was made beautifully. Yes, it was heavy on CGI and effects at some parts, but so is every movie no a days. Especially super hero movies. One difference is that it didn't completely rely on those effects. The actors were developed very well too. For example the movie goes through Diana and her childhood and highlights important moments that lead to her leaving the Amazonians, stepping into her role as Wonder Woman. The films effect on the general public was great as well. Not only has it been (continues to be) a great boost for the DC franchise, but it's had effect on children everywhere. Being the first movie of its kind directed by a woman AND having a woman as the main character has resounded through young girls always in search of someone to look up to other than a barbie or princess."
"redfor","10","6","16","11 June 2017"," Wonder Woman: A Wonderfully Wild Ride
","I saw the film last Monday, and still it replays clearly in my mind.<br/><br/>Where and how it begins:<br/><br/>'Themyscira' is the name of the city – on one of 'The Paradise Islands'. The lone child – Diana Prince, who will become Wonder Woman – observes a number of Amazons, who are training to defend against whatever may come their way. This opening irresistibly pulled me in, without a chance of even momentary distraction.<br/><br/>The equestrian aspects of these sequences are spectacular, as is the collective-athleticism of the actresses (er, the women warriors in battle preparation). During the film, at least two references are made to the ancient Greeks; the early training and battle sequence are all but Olympian.<br/><br/>The first man Diana meets is Steve Trevor (Chris Pine killing it, as usual), who's mere existence is in peril at that moment. Amazonian fighting and sacrifices save him, and Diana will soon partner with him to save the world. The most hilarious part of the film occurs when Diana – full of curiosity – asks how he compares to other human males.<br/><br/>The cinematography is hypnotically picturesque – I could not look away. A huge fan of Robin Wright's acting since Forest Gump, I still failed to notice it was she also adding to this fabulous feature. All but the visual aspects shot in nearly-total darkness, are mind- boggling. <br/><br/>The score nearly knocked me out on numerous occasions. It's rare that I can't habitually analyze what's musically happening, yet it happened here. One musical cue featured strings and (I believe), clarinets as the only other instruments. Breaks into battle scenes featured beautiful brass parts – there may not have been woodwinds in these segments.<br/><br/>I'd be remiss if I failed to acknowledge Connie Nielsen in this review. As with Ms. Wright, I was so drawn in I couldn't pause to recognize her. Movie-theater fascination such as this hasn't happened to me since childhood; should I confess to it now? David Thewlis as Ares (God of War), Danny Huston as General Ludendorff, and Elena Anaya as 'Doctor Poison', are proof positive of this film's greatness: villains this delicious are not found in every movie. The entire cast and crew have much to be proud of.<br/><br/>At two hours and twenty one minutes, there was a need for some expository moments. With all elements landing as they do, they're far from deal breakers.<br/><br/>I have but a two-word request of everyone involved with the making of Wonder Woman:<br/><br/>More, please."

She turned out to be a total meathead. She was shown to be a fragile meathead who wanted Chris Pine to show her military tactics, communication skills,social interactions. Sure she is from another world, but they showed her to be a brainwashed soldier. I wanted a Wonder woman who was a leader, a general, a tactician. You would think they would have taught her all of that in Amazonia. Nope.she is just multilingual and a good fighter.And Chris Pine had to restrain her from making stupid decisions throughout the movie. Zack Snyder is the Uwe Boll for DC superheroes. Good god they need to cut all ties with this virus. Overall,its a movie worth watching once.Great action sequences and cinematography. The actor for Ares lacked depth. I really didn't feel like hating him. I didn't feel the connection like I had with Heath Ledger's Joker or Tom Hardy's Bane. There was not much time invested in him.

"jcolyer1229","10","6","16","9 June 2017"," Wonder Woman - great movie!
","Wonder Woman opens with Diana Prince in Paris, probably in 1980. We see the Eiffel Tower, the Seine and the Pyramid in front of the Louvre. A vehicle from (Bruce) Wayne Enterprises delivers a picture taken during World War I. Then, we flash back to Diana's childhood on the island of Themyscira. Diana is an Amazon, intrigued by combat and training. Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielson) is protective of her daughter and hopes she never has to fight. Hippolyta sculpted Diana from clay, and Zeus brought her to life. Hippolyta recounts how Ares, the god of war, rebelled and killed all the gods except Zeus. Hippolyta takes young Diana to a tower and shows her the sword known as the God Killer. Time passes, and Antiope (Robin Wright) begins to train Diana. Antiope knows Ares is alive and will return. Grown-up Diana (Gal Gadot) stands on a cliff looking into the Aegean Sea. Steve Trevor's (Chris Pine) plane crashes into the water, and Diana dives in to save him. She drags him to the beach. She has never seen a man! The German's are pursuing Trevor because he is a spy and has stolen Dr. Isabel Maru's (Dr. Poison) book of formulas. There is a battle on the beach, and the Germans are no match for the Amazons. But Antiope is killed with her final word being ""God Killer!"" Hippolyta thinks Trevor is a German and wants to kill him. Diana assures her mother that he fought on her side. The Lasso of Truth compels Trevor to tell his story. He infiltrated the Germans, grabbed Dr. Poison's book and ran. Trevor tells the women about the war to end all wars, and Diana is certain that Ares is behind the conflict. Trevor bathes in healing water. Diana climbs the tower to get the God Killer. No easy task even for her! Gal Gadot looks like Wonder Woman! She and Steve leave the island by boat after a touching goodbye scene with her mother. Hippolyta gives her Antiope's tiera, and it is off to the war! Diana and Steve have some sex talk on the boat while sailing to London. They pass under the Tower Bridge, which I crossed on foot in 1994. Enter Erich Ludendorff (a real general in World War I) and his deadly chemist. Dr. Poison creates the mustard gas for which the war is famous. We meet Etta Candy, Steve's secretary and a comic character, who helps Diana choose appropriate clothes. Gal Gadot is charming as she tries on various outfits. She is stunning in her hat and glasses. Steve and Diana are followed and have to fight off assailants. Thank goodness for ""bullets and bracelets!"" The couple deliver the stolen notebook to Steve's superiors, and we encounter Sir Patrick Morgan (who is actually Ares). Diana translates the formulas written in Sumerian. Amazons know hundreds of languages! Diana is still convinced Ares is behind the war. She and Steve head for the front after Steve enlists the help of 3 oddballs. These are Sammy (a womanizer), Charlie (a marksman) and the Chief (a smuggler). Sammy likes women and when Wonder Woman does her thing, he is ""both frightened and aroused."" Steve wants to destroy a second weapons facility. At the front, Diana confronts the horrors of war! It is trench warfare. Frustrated by the lack of progress, she transforms herself into Wonder Woman and leads the charge across ""no man's land."" It is an inspiring scene with Wonder Woman taking all the fire, deflecting it with her shield. Goddess Gadot! She has that look! We stare into Gal's eyes! Or does she stare into ours? She uses her lasso, tossing Germans left and right. That eerie music from the soundtrack starts, and Wonder Woman demonstrates her strength. The Belgium town of Veld is liberated, and a period of calm follows. A picture is taken, the same one we saw at the beginning of the movie. Sammy says he wanted to be an actor but is the wrong color. Charlie sings and plays the piano. It starts snowing as Steve and Diana get romantic. They dance, then retire to an upstairs room where they make love. Diana now believes Ludendorff is Ares and sets out to kill him. She thinks it will stop the war. They crash the German high command's party. Gal is gorgeous in the blue dress! Diana and Ludendorff dance. Steve and Dr. Poison talk. Steve wants to find and destroy the gas. Diana realizes that all men are to blame for war, not just the Germans and not just Ares. As Wonder Woman, she follows Ludendorff and kills him. But the war continues! Great quote: ""It's not about what you deserve. It's about what you believe."" Suddenly, Sir Patrick shows! He is Ares! An epic fight ensues: Wonder Woman versus Sir Patrick! The God Killer proves useless, and Ares says only a god can kill another god. Steve hijacks the plane carrying mustard gas to London. He blows it up while sacrificing his own life. Ares is a formidable foe, even for Wonder Woman, providing the comic book violence so prevalent in modern movies. Steve gives Diana his watch to remember him by before running down the plane. She watches the plane explode and Steve die, and this gives her the adrenaline to defeat Ares. Gadot expresses emotions well. She was born to play Wonder Woman! She conveys her passion! Steve tells Diana he can save the day, but she can save the world. ""I love you!"" are his last words. With Ares' demise, the war ends. Should our history books give Wonder Woman credit for stopping World War I? We cut to celebrations and flag-waving in London. Diana touches a picture of Steve next to his plane. It is 1980 again, and she confides that only love can save the world. She has found her mission! Forever!"

"mike48128","10","7","20","19 June 2017"," A ""10"" means excellent but not perfect. Best Superhero film ever?
","I could also pick this film apart as there are so many stereotypes in it. ""The Chief"" (American Indian) is the worst! The story could have been set in either World War, except for the early aircraft. I have to keep reminding myself that it is a fantasy-comic book creation and it far outclasses even ""Superman-I"", ""Batman Returns"", and it's reboot. It opens with a fascinating ""travelogue"" to the hidden Island of the Amazons. ""Diana"" is truly unique, but does not know that she is the daughter of Zeus; not even told by her own mother. Curious that Amazons are almost invincible, but can be felled by a single lead bullet. The legend was changed as a man landing on the island should have taken away the women's powers. Also, I want to comment about Wonder Woman's costume. Briefer than a Trump statement yet un-revealing to all, like cheerleader ""spanky pants"". Perhaps aided by CGI? Now back to the movie. The Germans are even more evil than usual. The Amazons ""take no prisoners"" and even Wonder Woman kills off a lot of people. That's a different ""take"" than most DC heroes. The mad ""Dr. Maru"" wears a ""Phantom of the Opera"" mask and she creates hideous gases that promise uncontrollable strength and nightmarish execution. The film deserves it's PG-13 rating as it is quite violent (without being too overly graphic).""Ares"" the God of War, is disguised as an elderly British aristocrat. He will allow Mankind to destroy the Earth so that he can recreate it in his image of peace? A-1 in most respects, and if it doesn't ""run-away"" with several technical Oscars then the Academy is truly blind to mainstream films. Some of it is almost spellbinding and most of the roles are very well-cast. I suppose that a ""Clash of the Titans"" finish (Diana vs. Ares) was necessary, but as always, it's too grandiose and overdone. Does Diana ""drop a plane"" (no houses available) on evil Dr. Poison or not? (I failed to stay to the end of the titles for a possible ""Easter Egg"".) A great performance by Gal Gadot. Like most ""Batmans"", some of her chest is padded! She runs and leaps (aided by CGI) quite convincingly and looks the part as she does many of her own stunts. Chris Pine is a likable ""Bill Shatner-type"", and doesn't quite ""become"" his character ""Steve"". In ""Wonder Woman Magazine"" ""Ares"" cannot die, so I expect him to return again in spite of his apparent demise in this movie. Worth seeing on a big screen, so don't just wait for the Blu-Ray!"

I was born in the seventies and for me seeing these characters brought to life with crazy realistic effects just blows me away. The things they can do now is truly beautiful. I give superhero moves a 10 across the board, every time, no matter how awful the script may be.

","There were many parts of this movie that just made me stop and say, 'wait, what?' to my girlfriend and she did the same with me, being a person who appreciated comics herself for many years and we both had different reasons for doing so. I mostly came up with points that were about how contrary the movie kept being in terms of ideas already established. For me this is unforgivable as it ruins the flow of the movie and makes you doubt how much thought was put into maintaining continuity and facts presented. My girlfriend was more about how they had change aspects of the story of Wonder Woman and her origin and she's not big on that either as the lore is long since established and she like it when the movies stay true to the sources, as they should but are regularly changed for convenience of the film makers. Both of us were pretty bored by the fact that there were no stakes. Wonder Woman was just Superman in a skirt, could fire lazer beams, could fly, could throw a tank, could be pummeled multiple times BY A GOD and she didn't bare a single scratch. It's like playing Doom back in the day in God Mode, boring. We were also nonplussed by the fact that there was a warrior who was waving her sword around like a fool who and like it was made of foam when coming out of department store or wondering how WAR works, despite having been shown that she was highly educated (to degrees that are quite impossible and immersion breaking). None of the characters spoke like they were in the 191X's and a SAIL boat can sail from what must have been the Mediterranean (given the Ottoman placement) to London overnight. There is I suppose if you can be like the popcorn consumption juggernauts behind us and turn your brain off, or are oblivious to geography and common sense this would be a pretty good movie but if you can't and you have to be 'one of those people' who must have a story make sense and have reasons behind actions, clear morals and ethics and demand some tension created by stakes you're only going to think this is just another average 'unbelieveably overpowered, unstoppable, godlike being makes holes in CGI things'.

"slicedbread117","5","7","20","2 June 2017"," The Final Straw for the DC Extended Universe
","The tools were finally there, the tools necessary to build the true ""saving grace"" of the mess that is the DCEU, the potential to deliver a Wonder Woman film worthy of the character's name, and to start mending the broken bones of the franchise. Alas, at least for this disappointed fan, the DCEU has completely lost my interest, and Wonder Woman (WW) was the final straw to do it.<br/><br/>Not since 2013's Man of Steel has the DCEU had a solo film, and with DC's plan to play catch-up to Marvel showing it's signs of over- doing it, WW was the perfect opportunity to slow things down and develop a character properly. While I'll say the movie succeeds in at least developing Wonder Woman as a character, and is a refreshing change of pace to the clustered storytelling the DCEU has come to be known for, overall, the script was too safe for its own good, bland and unoriginal, almost to an extreme. The less than admirable narrative delivers a decent first act, a sloppy and disjointed second act, and a third act that delivers some spectacle and heartfelt emotion, but nothing more that makes the film stand out. There are numerous plot holes, comic book inaccuracies and a litany of clichés from start to finish, and I don't have enough words available to describe all of them. The climax of the film was so generic, I honestly felt like I was watching an Iron Man 3/Star Wars rip-off, with the villain fake-out (which was as predictable as you could get), the ""join the dark side"" motive, to the using your anger and rage for personal gain. Not besides the beginnings of the film did the plot deliver much of any originality, and even that was a borderline disgrace to the Wonder Woman comics and Greek mythology as a whole. The writers of the film, which include Zack Snyder, and director Patty Jekins failed to give the world an original, inspiring and exciting Wonder Woman story, and that hits hard.<br/><br/>We are introduced to numerous new characters along the course of the run time, and while that usually is a positive, WW fails in almost every aspect of producing a meaningful, interesting supporting cast. Wonder Woman herself was written decently; her motives mean well and her power, while still developing, is strong and intriguing. While it sure would have been nice to see a full-power WW more often, the path to discovering her powers is an exciting piece of the film. The issues I faced with the character was only that too often she was ordered around in the world of men. Wonder Woman knows her mission, but it takes her too long to break free of everyone else and just do what she does best, which isn't trying on clothes to fit in, or being reluctant to help others in need it's simply finding and killing Ares, and this is a heavy flaw in the characters writing. <br/><br/>Steve Trevor, the love interest, and arguably his friend Sam, are the only other acceptable characters in the film, which gives WW some sense of connecting to its characters, something the DCEU has little to none of. Aside from them, however, every other character is utterly useless. The rest of Trevor's crew, his secretary, the Amazons on Themyscira and more were a total misfire. The movie puts a handful of scenes in to try and make you care about these characters, but you never once do, especially General Antiope, who has the cheesiest death possible. The first set of villains, Ludendorff and Dr. Poison, are so poorly written and developed it's laughable, some of the worst antagonists in superhero film history. They create plot holes (like what in the hell was Ludendorff snorting and how did it give him magic power?), pose zero threat and overall, waste time that could have been better spent on the real villain, Ares. If the film had spent all of it's time developing Ares from the start, the movie could have turned out very differently, for the better. Ares is the god of war, yet he is under-powered, underdeveloped and criminally underused as the main villain. Even his cool looks, monologues and action sequence can't save him from being one of the weaker villains in recent comic book film history.<br/><br/>The action and choreography, while a brief step up from past DCEU films, is bogged down so heavily by slow motion and more action scene clichés that it's hard to consistently enjoy. The opening battle scene (while totally inaccurate, Amazons could never be harmed by any form of bullet) was fun to watch and as WW grew stronger she became more exciting to watch fight, which especially held true in the final act. But I can't in good faith say the action, regardless of pretty visuals, was groundbreaking or jaw dropping in any way. It was, in a term, so-so. <br/><br/>The cast is mediocre, and that largely has to do the abysmal character writing and poor script. Gal Gadot does her job at portraying the Amazon Princess, she looks the part, delivers her lines in a convincing enough fashion, and sets a solid tone for female superhero lead films. Chris Pine also is OK as Steve Trevor, doing his best with what he had to work with, but literally every other actor failed to stand out, which I believe, again, was solely based on the horrible writing.<br/><br/>I'll be the first to say how atrocious BvS and Suicide Squad were, but even still, I held my expectations high that maybe, just maybe DC could regain its touch they found with Man of Steel and reignite my interest through Wonder Woman. However, with the most disappointed heart I can say, Wonder Woman is another swing and a miss for the DCEU and now with 3 strikes in a row, for me personally, DC is out.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Though DC has the best superheroes, they seemed to be having a really hard time presenting good characters and stories for their live action movies, and its really too bad that wonder woman is no exception. I was really looking forward to this movie and after stellar reviews I really thought I would enjoy it. Sadly I didn't. Like Man of Steel, the opening is done well. But once Steve Trevor reaches Paradise island it all goes to pot. Everything they tried to keep 'secret' was telegraphed from the beginning and the silly story-line just made me mad. In Batman versus Superman, Gadot was the only shining light. She was again the point of interest in this story with Chris Pine's doing a good job. The Amazons were great characters. But one character proved totally out of place for his role in the film. The special effects were kind of sucky with everything looking fake. With all its stellar reviews, the audience was silent after the movie was over and everyone rushed for the exits; that's not a good sign. I know the film will make money but DC will continue to follow Marvel instead of leading."
"michaelmcdonald-20730","7","8","24","1 June 2017"," Entertaining, but unoriginal and a bit dull at times.
","I'm not involved in the D.C. vs Marvel debate, but it's pretty apparent this film is a mishmash of the first Captain America and Thor movies. The plot is the same as Captain America (stop the evil rouge German general from using the spooky weapon he's making in his secret lab), while the romance and humor are very similar to Thor (a man/woman from a mythical planet/island awkwardly interact with human society along side their romantic partners). <br/><br/>The plot doesn't move quite smoothly, and it's often difficult to determine how characters got from point A to point B. The secondary characters are forgettable, as is the villain (the perennial problem with comic book movies it seems). Chris Pine and Gal Gadot have great chemistry, and the humor mostly works, being lighthearted without becoming unnecessarily goofy. The action scenes are too few, and lacking the intensity to create enough suspense, but it's still fun to see Wonder Woman kickass, especially with that lasso. <br/><br/>I won't spoil the movie, but the ending is a letdown down, and quite inexplicable upon further reflection. That being said, the stunning Gal Gadot carries this movie, and her performance so encapsulates the intelligence, heroism and beauty of Wonder Woman, that it's enough to make the movie worth it."

","Wonder Woman is one of the best films I've ever seen even if the other people think that the plot is not that much complicated. Maybe because everything is perfect, the film turned out to be a great one.<br/><br/>Even though it's a great film, it's so sad to see Steve died. His love on Diana touched me. When he said ""I can save today, you can save the world"", I really cried. (And that sentence is my favourite.) His death is the saddest scene in the entire film.<br/><br/>Since Wonder Woman is flawless, so, there is not much things to point out in this review. Thus, to be short, this film is highly enjoyable and I totally recommend you all to watch. I'm quite sure you won't regret it because it's really, really a great film. Totally loved it."

Batman vs Super Man did nothing other from make us like Lois. If it was cannon to the dark knight series then things may be better but it isn't. However, after the amount of sexism from Ghostbusters, people actually rated Wonder Woman a high score.<br/><br/>It was one of the best DC films, I'm not a DC fan to be honest, Marvel is better but on this occasion, Wonder Woman did a fantastic job. The villains, fights and settings were all perfect. Although I'm attracted to hundreds of girls, I don't have much of an opinion on Gal Gadot other from the fact that she's a good actress. Wonder Woman is one of the better DC characters, followed by Bane and Batman. Anyone who liked Wonder Woman can now re-watch Ghostbusters and say that is was fine and not terrible. Like, it beat the second original one. <br/><br/>I loom forward to the Wonder Woman sequel and seeing her in Justice League. Ares was a cool villain."

The BAD acting! The screwed up Wonder Woman story-line! The inaccuracies GALORE!! The laughable and incorrect ""accents""!!!! The FLAT CHESTED, DWARF woman playing the Amazon! The superlative BAD, BAD casting (except for Etta Candy)! <br/><br/>OMG! Patty Jenkins is a COMEDIC MASTER!!!

She put everybody else to shame!<br/><br/>This movie isn't billed as a comedy, so I fully expected some actual serious stuff. But after almost cracking a few ribs laughing so hard after watching this enormously hysterical comedy of errors, I can see now why so many people liked it.<br/><br/>SUCH a good laugh! <br/><br/>But I have to say, DC has destroyed Wonder Woman for me.

"mpless","4","5","13","9 September 2017"," The best collection of limited-range actors - EVER!
","I rate the title so highly because of some of the special effects which were truly adequate. The rest of the movie deserves oblivion.<br/><br/>Chris Pine, Gal Gadot, Connie Nielsen, and Robin Wright all have such poor acting skills that their performances were standard and unmoving expressions throughout the film. I half expected Pine to flip open a communicator and call out ""Spock?"" and Wright to address him as ""Frank."" Others have already pointed out astonishing continuity errors in the movie, but for me the worst was Pine's entrance when a German warship enters the ""bubble"" that hides the Amazon's home from view. Some boats with soldiers (not sailors) are launched and the soldiers get wiped-out eventually shown with interminable slow-mo ""action"" scenes. Next scene, the warship is gone. No mention of it, and it would seem there's no radio communication from the captain back to base because it is never seen again, nor is there any investigation into this mysterious island that is on nobody's charts. Never mind that dozens of highly-trained archers couldn't wipe out most of the soldiers before they got within 50 metres of shore because few marksmen could aim faithfully on a badly wallowing boat in choppy seas. And when the soldiers do reach shore, it appears the archers promptly pack up and go home but for a few who remain around to be picked-off at will.<br/><br/>There are of course, the mandatory sexist comments against Diana by the older men but none seems to have strong enough views to enforce them. And although her skimpy costume (by the day's standards) shocks Pine's secretary, not one other member of the population of London or France, or Germany sees fit to comment.<br/><br/>On the topic of costumes, the Amazons all seem to have selected their garments from a 14-years-old boy's fantasies and this appears to be pretty much their sole wardrobe. Other credibility issues revolve around the artfully sculpted eyebrows and hair, perfectly waxed bodies and the lipstick that most of the island's residents wear. But then WW is no worse than most post-apocalypse sc-fi movies in this regard.<br/><br/>There are far too many slo-mo sequences in the movie and these quickly contributed to the boredom already founded by the wooden acting and shoddy script. Since when did Wonder Woman gain the ability to fly, too? When I last read the comic books she certainly couldn't because she had an invisible plane to get around in. Yet, superman-like in the final scene she launches herself into the air and soars towards the horizon.<br/><br/>Like so much that is produced nowadays the film is big on explosive spectacle and special effects; short on good (never mind great) acting, a formulaic script, and a plot that's calculated to be simple enough for the lowest common denominator to understand.<br/><br/>Sure it made money, but the obligatory sequel will not see any of my hard-earned spent on it."
"rdnyscott","10","5","13","3 September 2017"," Treaty of Versailles
","The FAQs for this movie quite incorrectly claims that WWII would still occur after the events of this movie. It actually would not, and the reason has nothing to do with Ares being killed. WWII could not occur because, in this movie, the TREATY OF VERSAILLES was killed. In real life, Ludendorff (as well as Hitler) blamed the signers of that treaty for ""stabbing Germany in the back"", and ultimately gassed Jews, partially in response to that. In this movie, the original signers are gassed by Ludendorff before they can even complete the process of signing. As a result, WWI ends, but not because of the Treaty of Versailles. This means Germany owes no reparations, so Germany is not impoverished, Jews are not blamed for betraying Germany, Hitler does not rise to power, and Poland does not become a separate country, so it can't be invaded by Germany because it remains part of German territory. Therefore, no WWII.<br/><br/>However, I had not wanted to make my movie review about that, though it is one of the most amazing insights of this movie, especially given the ethnic identities of the screenwriters, producers, and the star. Naturally, Ares is lying when he says ""I am not the god of war, but the god of truth"", meaning the lasso of truth does not work on him. You can't trust anything he says once that lasso is around him. He is, ironically, much more honest before that lasso winds up around him. However, this masterfully done movie is a major gem of truth. Ares is the father of Hippolyta and Antiope, making him the grandfather of Diana. Despite his claims, he had no intentions of crushing his granddaughter when he first met her, and he mostly hopes to scare her into joining him. He is not lying when he tells her he does not want to fight her. Diana's mother doesn't think humans are worth all of the family bickering, but she also lies to Diana when she claims Diana was fashioned from clay and therefore is not an Amazon. It is only because Diana IS an Amazon that she has the power to kill another god. Diana also knows her mother lied about that, because she repeatedly tells Steve that she IS an Amazon, but she is also trying to seduce Steve, so she also claims to Steve that she was fashioned from clay. She hopes that Steve will attempt to demonstrate for her where infants come from, and also prove to her that men are, indeed, necessary for sexual pleasure.<br/><br/>The symbolism of war originating in Britain, with ""Sir Patrick Morgan"" pretending to be too weak to personally fight, but hoping to profit from the war while he remains perfectly safe from afar, is also apt commentary about WWI. Symbolically, this movie is quite a history lesson that Americans have long remained unaware of."
"residentgrigo","8","5","13","18 August 2017"," A long overdue film
","The DCEU is now 4 films deep and finally landed the first universally acclaimed entry. I liked all, the director's cut for BvS is even one of my favorite films (look up my review), yet WW comes ""last"" despite doing many thing rights. Let's start with the positives: Gal presented great potential for being a unique action actress in Fast 5 and Snyder showed pure genius in casting her. A more fitting actress for Wonder Woman might not exist! Chris Pine equally delivered the strongest performance of his career, despite being given a role that frequently leads to nothing in the comics. A lot of his charm comes due to his chemistry with Diana and I would make a case for him being the ""real"" hero of the story, due to his willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty and keeping a cool head throughout. His actions in the 3rd act especially put a key moment in BvS in a new perspective... The whole cast is very good, with Apache Chief and Etta Candy (literally the first time I like the character!) standing out but I will admit that Steve's band of agents could have used 1 member less. Let's go with the highly clichÃ©d sniper, not that I truly disliked him. Dr. Poison and the actual god form of Ares were great too but more about the way the film reaches him later.<br/><br/>The film is divided in 3 VERY different acts. The highly comic accurate first 40 minutes show Diana growing up on the hidden amazon island Themyscira. The way the film intermixes the 1987 Post Crisis comic reboot with the more violent New52 version is borderline perfect and i look forward to see the amazons again in JLA. The decision keep the Greek gods as actual gods is worthy of praise too, especially due to their universal recognition, but Suicide Squad and JLA also feature deities. I hope that a sequel can follow up on the mystical aspect of the film and Diana's heritage and form a connection to the New Gods in JLA. Not to derail into spoilers or complex comic canon. The 2nd act is a humorous fish out of water story, intermixed with social commentary and surface level insight into WW1 that is deep enough to work, without overtaxing an unfamiliar audience why the war was so complex. I suspect that this part of the film connected the most with audience but I like it the least. Much time is spend with Diana dressing up, attending war councils and setting up Steve's band of international men of mystery. Even the German side is shown a few times, to point out how bad the ""enemy's"" infantry has it. It also becomes easy to see why WW 1 was chosen over WW 2. It lacks true villains, while allowing the filmmakers to touch on the darker sides of war without going into bleak topics as concentration camps and how fascism swept Europe. Something The First Avenger completely sides-stepped by inventing a faceless enemy vaguely affiliated with the Nazis, to not offend international viewers. Sigh. This core portion of the film is undeniably an important step for the DCEU, as even I must admit that a truly lighthearted film needs to come sooner than later. We get glimpses of it here, yet i again found the 2nd act a bit unfocused. Especially if I consider how out of nowhere the 3rd act comes. This part is what seemingly connected least with audiences but it has the best scenes in the whole film, despite being a bit rough overall. I 100% get why the film handled the Ares reveal the way it did. The overall idea is clever but I don't think that the character of (the historic) Ludendorff was needed, not to go into spoilers. Dr. Poison should have been the single German villain, with proper glimpses of the actual God of War's machinations interspersed throughout the film to build him up, as he borderline comes out of nowhere. His proper confrontation with Diana and the fight are pure gold. Especially due to how dark the film is willing to go (WW sure kills a lot of poor grunts while going berserk). Imagine if Zod only showed up in the 3rd act of Man of Steel, with only talk about him before nearly the 2 hour mark. I love where the film ended up but the way there could have used a re-write, with a shorter 2nd act.<br/><br/>It's still quite an achievement that such a serious, and frankly child inappropriate, film near universally managed to connect with audiences. The 3rd act is as dark as BvS or TDK and the film resembles the somewhat divisive MoS more than it does Superman 78. The slightly anti-chronological structure, the muddy color pallet and the relentless action scenes quickly betray Zack Snyder's fingerprint, in the same way Christoper Nolan loomed larger over MoS. Director Patty Jenkins should get more control over the next film and I hope for a much different follow-up but this Snyder X Jenkins ""cross-over"" undeniably worked. The main reason for WW getting a better reception than MoS is likely due to fewer expectations from the audience, as her (often changing) comic characterization and canon are largely unknown to the public. The film is also easier to ""digest"" than previous DCEU films but I will note that the last WW feature, an animated movie from 2009, is neither better nor worse than this first cinematic solo outing. One of many more to come, so I look forward to Diana being the deuteragonist of JLA and the star if her solo franchise. I lastly recommend to rediscover her in the Ultimate Cut of BvS. The film may surprisingly grow on you on 2nd viewing."

","We've been living in the superhero film adaptation world for quite some time now. The current DCEU has struggled to create an adaptation that is memorable or even worthy of its source material. ""Wonder Woman"" approaches its core character with the intention of telling a compelling origin story, and in my opinion, it succeeds immensely. The strengths are found in a very likable Gal Gadot as our hero, beautifully rendered action sequences, a healthy amount of humor, a worthy villain, and an extremely memorable score. Let's be honest, the DCEU needed a boost, and no one could have predicted it to be Princess Diana. #wonderwoman"
"stephenabell","8","5","13","19 July 2017"," The Best Of The New DC Universe Movies By Far
","Finally, the DC Movie Universe has made a film they can be proud of. This film is definitely a step in the right direction for the DC Superheros, though, it doesn't make up for the travesties which came before it. They should use this as the mile stick with which to measure their up and coming films. Though I cannot help but feel Justice League will be taking a few steps backwards from this film.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that the writers decided to use mix the origin stories up and have Diana coming to the world of man during the First World War; this strengthens the concept of her being immortal. As well as allowing for some nice special effects in the dog fight scenes and other period specific weaponry. Zeus created the Amazons to bring love and peace to mankind, though mankind corrupted by Ares enslaved them. Hippolyte led a revolt to free the Amazons and when Zeus brought the god to help in their defence Ares killed them. Zeus with his dying breath crippled Ares and created Themyscira to hide the Amazons from mankind. So here is the first error, Zeus is dead but yet he later breathes life into a clay-shaped human effigy to create Diana. All is well on the island until Steve Trevor's plane crashes off the coast and Diana dives in to save him. Trevor has the secret poison book of Dr, Maru; the Germans hot on his trail shoot him down, Here comes a second error, there's a group of Germans in a rowboat looking for the wreckage of the plane, they stick their head through the fog which hides the island and then attacks the Amazons... and lose, of course. Though I did wonder where the battleship they came from and the one which had shot Trevor down has disappeared to... as we see no more Germans (sloppy writing). Believing Ares is to blame for the ongoing war, Trevor describes, Diana takes it upon herself to hunt him down and kill him, with the God Killer sword.<br/><br/>As I stated there are a couple of obvious errors in the opening set up and this continues throughout the film. It would have been nice if somebody had pointed them out so they could be taken care off. Most of them are small issues and easily resolved but they do hinder the film a little. <br/><br/>However, they are only small and the movie is pretty massive so the good does outweigh the bad. Though Gal Gadot does a good job in the Wonder Woman persona, she's not too great as Diana Prince. Saying she's coming from an island where the main way to travel is by horse and foot, where they are trained in sword fighting and archery, and the main food is fresh fish, vegetables and fruit she doesn't appear too surprised by automobiles, aeroplanes, ships, and the modern weaponry... let alone the ""new food"". Though they include the ""Ice Cream"" scene it would have been nice to have seen a little more childish enthusiasm and awe in this character.<br/><br/>Chris Pine fits the Steve Trevor character like a glove and gets his persona down pat, though a little more womanising, or even hints at it would've added strength to it. Lucy Davis is splendid as Etta Candy, Steve Trevor's secretary, and actually has the air of awe I wished Diana Prince to have. The bad guy Ludendorff and his crony Dr Maru are brilliantly played by Danny Huston and Elena Anaya, respectively. They give a creepy and flesh-crawling performance in their roles. David Thewlis was an inspired choice for Sir Patrick, though I have to admit I'm not too sure that he was completely right for the part, though I do know what the writers and director were doing when they cast him. Not a completely genius move, but close.<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins does a marvellous job of the directing. She keeps the action tight and fast paced though has the nerve to slow it down at the right times to emphasize an action, a movement, or a special effect. This keeps it interesting for the viewer. Though in the more drama based sets she opts for a more standard style of camera work. A few differing camera angles would have been nice. Though this is a lighter film in atmosphere to other DC adaptations there are a lot of scenes shot in dark atmosphere's A little normal lighting and brighter sets would've strengthened the darkness and grimness of the front line, which was filmed with the same filters as their entry into London. So the front line could have been a muddy football field in London. It would have been nice to bring DC out of the dark fully.<br/><br/>That said this is a really entertaining film, which sticks to the characters basic ethos. It is a spectacularly nice waste of time which I would recommend anybody to see and unlike previous DC Universe Movies, this one is really worth watching... and may even be worth keeping. As stated before, I hope they take heed of this movie and implement this style of film making and storytelling into their upcoming films."

","The main reason why I loved this film is because it showed strong women without the narrative of their empowerment being contrived. In other words, no one was yelling ""LOOK, I'M A WOMAN AND I'M STRONG""; their strength was displayed in their action. For me, the best parts were the fighting sequences (especially the battles on Themyscira and No Man's Land), Wonder Woman's compassion for people (in a time where women were suppressed, she stood tall because she understood/embraced her purpose), the ""fish out of water"" plot was done well, Diana and Steve's chemistry (their banter was hilarious; kudos to Gal and Chris), Queen Hippolyta and General Antiope were awesome (Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright were amazing) and most of all, the Amazonians were diverse, which is socially relevant nowadays. A few scenes moved a little too slow for me, which I can overlook as I feel that happens with most origin stories I watch. Overall, I LOVED this film; the only person that loved it more than me is my 8 year old daughter.

"theandrewahern","9","5","13","27 June 2017"," Wonder Woman (2017) Movie Review
","It's about time a movie within the DC Extended Universe garnered some favorable reviews from both critics and fans alike. Not only has director Patty Jenkins and star Gal Gadot's 'Wonder Woman', managed to do just that, it has been praised and hailed as one of the best comic-book movies to date, and the best made under the DC banner since Christopher Nolan's 2008 masterpiece, 'The Dark Knight'. I agree wholeheartedly, and I'm proud to say that I absolutely loved Zack Snyder's 'Man of Steel' and the 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' Ultimate Edition.<br/><br/>There's something about 'Wonder Woman' that really makes it stand out from the crowded sea of superhero films that have flooded the market over the past few years. Actually, there are a number of things. First and foremost is the performance given by Israeli actress Gal Gadot, who absolutely owns the role as Diana Prince. In every line she speaks and expression she makes, the emotional weight of the story on her character and the people are her is visible and palpable. Diana's innocence and desire to protect the world and make it a better place are perfectly displayed, as is her strength and skill in the movie's amazing fight scenes. Gal Gadot simply is Wonder Woman. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor also gives a great performance, playing off of the innocence of Gadot's Diana Prince very nicely, succeeding in creating a believable relationship between the two. The rest of the cast, including Connie Neilson, Robin Wright, SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui, Ewen Bremner, and Eugene Brave Rock, among others, do a very fine job in their supporting roles.<br/><br/>As with any superhero movie, and with ones within the DCEU specifically, the action sequences are one of the most important aspects of the film- and the fight scenes and action sequences in 'Wonder Woman' certainly do not disappoint, (even if one or two of them features some CGI that isn't absolutely perfect). The choreography throughout the film is amazing and the scenes are enhanced through an incredibly emotional score by Rupert Gregson-Williams, both during action sequences and during slower moments. Not since Hans Zimmer's work in 'The Dark Knight Rises', 'Man of Steel', and 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', has a film's score stood out to me so magnificently. You will not soon forget the action and music in this movie. Not a chance.<br/><br/>While I'm not one of the many who believes the DC Extended Universe has been a complete mess up until this point, I will absolutely agree that the franchise needed win with both critics and fans- and 'Wonder Woman' delivers in full. The entire movie is a success, and from start to finish provides a sense of wonder similar to that of the 'flight' sequence in 'Man of Steel'. Never before have I felt so much genuine emotion and passion from an actor or actress than what Gal Gadot provides in 'Wonder Woman'. This is the perfect superhero movie, and if the rest of the coming DCEU films are anything like what Patty Jenkins and her crew have done with this movie, then we're all in for something truly special.<br/><br/>A success in every way, 'Wonder Woman' is something truly special- cementing itself as one of the greatest superhero movies yet to be created, and Gal Gadot's performance as one of- if not the best, superhero portrayal of all time."

","A beautiful movie showcasing an awe-inspiring female protagonist who brilliantly portrays an iconic comic book character that never really got its due till now. Patty Jenkins deserves lavish praise for the sensitivity, empathy, and grace that she infuses in Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is spot on, creating a memorable character that now occupies pride of place in a pantheon hitherto dominated by male superheroes. Sigh! If only this movie had come before Dawn of Justice! Only two points of discord; the movie takes its time pacing the viewer through WW's early stages - bad news for viewers battling attention deficit issues. Then the villain lacks punch and isn't quite worthy of WW's golden lasso. Barring these debatable issues, this is a movie ya gotta see, one that presses all pleasure parameters!"

","In 2015, the post-credits zinger for Marvel's Ant-Man had Evangeline Lily's heroine, the Wasp, promised her own super suit. Her retort: ""It's about damn time."" The world echoed her sentiments. And waited. But alas: you snooze you lose, Marvel. Wonder Woman is here, loud, proud, heartfelt, and almost absurdly fun. Not to mention: in the super-super-saturated cinemas of late, it's the first female-led superhero film in 13(?!) years? Suddenly Wasp's pithy barb feels like the understatement of the century. <br/><br/>If we're going to continue to play the Marvel card (and we should, for Wonder Woman is more akin to the MCU's bright, mischievously fun fare than any of its sombre, melodramatic, ludicrously unironic DC precedents), director Patty Jenkins magpies the best bits of Captain America and Thor into a robustly satisfying romp. It's a lot to juggle, simultaneously sating the twin bastions of feminism and fun in the rare superhero film expected to be About Something, but Jenkins, drawing upon nearly 80 years of fandom and iconography, is rightly confident. Her social commentary streak is as hearty as her flair for fun, and she gamely plunges into the film's WWI setting as a potent vehicle for one of the genre's most potent explorations of the ethics of action combat. Jenkins juxtaposing the sparking, saturated sapphire colour scheme of Diana's Amazon island with the sepia soot on the war-torn outside world (and just when we'd been enjoying a welcome break from the gloomy DC greysÂ… sigh) succinctly feeds into Diana's indictment of human cruelty. A superhero film sincere enough to advocate for empathy and benevolent compassion instead of revenge, justice, or simply violence? It's a core moral streak so puppy-eyed and earnest it would verge on cornball were it not sold with a ferocious fervour heartfelt enough to trigger twinges of guilty reflection in between bites of popcorn. And that's nothing to sneeze at. <br/><br/>But, paradoxically, in spite of this effective call for compassionÂ… there's almost never been a movie where watching someone punch things has felt so goddamn awesome. Jenkins uncorks action interludes with a zippy abandon, as balletic as they are concussively cathartic, so stupendously fun that you shouldn't be surprised to see audience members unconsciously swept to their feet with the infectious, heady momentum (Robin Wright, in particular, nearly steals the show with a functional cameo just by making ass-kicking in a leather miniskirt look so ferociously cool). Paired with the crisply perfect period wartime dÃ©cor, and especially when accompanied by her exhilarating and impossibly catchy guitar riff, Wonder Woman is the first superhero film in years where the fight scenes, rather than merely pleasant diversions, are moving, almost overwhelmingly endorphin-flooding experiences. The mere memory of Diana crumbling a clock tower or flattening a roof with single blows, or granted her very own Ã‰owyn moment by storming into no man's land (get it?) is enough to bring shivers of magnificence.<br/><br/>And that's when the shoe drops, and the 'women only Texas screening'-shaped elephant in the room rears its head: we've had decades for the exuberance of men hitting things to wear off. Wonder Woman reminds us of how much fun it can be to watch WOMEN hitting things, and how desperately rare it is. Mercilessly scrutinized under the gender policing microscope, Jenkins, cannily, doesn't oversell her gender politics. Instead, she calmly naturalizes them by steering the film through Diana's headstrong, take-no-sh*t character, with each feminist beat emerging naturally through her personality. It's oodles more effective than any polarizing, dogmatic diatribe, and yields many of the film's moments of sneaky humour. One aside in particular, where an exasperated Diana condemns petticoats and skirts for impeding high-kicks, instantly cements itself as an iconic reprieve of solidarity for women's dressing rooms for the next century. <br/><br/>Still, a Wonder Woman film would be moot without the right Gal in the lead. Here, it's indisputably clear that it's been worth waiting for Godot. Anchored by a tempestuous, fiery charisma, Godot's remarkable performance is just as unforgettable in her small moments of zealous humanity (her almost childlike indignation at a war counsel willing to abandon soldiers as a strategic coup, or equivalent jubilation when tasting ice cream for the first time) as she is fiercely convincing tossing tanks or bridling enemies with a glowing lasso. Supporting her, Chris Pine is at his most disarmingly hysterical and irreverently lovable here, and provides a welcome anchoring of incredulous realism when the film threatens to topple into being too steeped in mythology. Danny Huston's Red Skull clone hits all the requisite skulking, ominously pontificating adversarial notes, but he's nowhere near as interesting as Elena Anayu's luridly sinister and tragic Dr. Poison, who, disappointingly, is relegated to sidekick status. Thankfully, Diana's remarkably diverse cabal of 'Howling Commandos' pals remain on the right side of fun without overstaying their welcome (though Ewen Bremner is just one bug-eyed nibble of haggis away from belonging in a live action cartoon). Finally, David Thewlis' droll prissiness perfectly befits Diana's befuddled ambassador to the human world, even if his range isn't quite up for the challenge plot twists demand of him. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman isn't perfect â€“ there are expanses when Jenkins' juggernaut pacing fumbles (especially an overlong expository origin governed by an overbearingly dour Connie Nielsen), and it toes the line of being a touch too derivative, leaning on its superhero predecessors so liberally that key emotional moments threaten to belly flop from over-familiarity. Still, it's only a fleeting wobble of tentativeness and creative laziness, that only serves to reinforce Robin Wright's advice: Wonder Woman is at its (/her) best when she truly believes in herself. Still, when Godot is armoured up, flashing her gauntlets and kicking through walls, the film achieves an almost peerless sense of infectious awesomeness. Will its legacy abide? Well, I'll let the waves of young girls (and boys!) jump-kicking and slamming their forearms together when stampeding out of the auditorium of my screening speak for themselves. <br/><br/>-9/10"

","Great movie to see at the theater. DC hit's a homer with this one. Not knowing the Wonder Woman story, it was great to progress through this origin with her. Great use of the Matrix style slow and stop action. I love this because you can really take in all the beauty of the scene and respect the production elements that go into it. Marvels Days of Future Past set the bar high with the Quick Silver segment and there is enough sprinkling of that filming technique used in this movie...more please.

"kut_u_up-1","8","5","13","17 June 2017"," Great, if a little clichÃ© at times.
","Finally got around to seeing it this afternoon. I went along with a friend who really wanted to see it. I wasn't too fussed, but I was pleasantly surprised. The character of Diana Prince was well fleshed out, even if her origin story was a bit rushed, and large parts of her upbringing were skimmed over, we saw enough to get a good picture of her as a person. I felt like they were in a bit of a rush to get her origin out of the way so the action could start. The real charm comes when she enters the realm of mankind and has to deal with the reality of the WWI world vs. the world she had been taught as a child to be the world of mankind, full of honour, love etc. but with pockets of corruption and war as a result of the god of war holding sway.<br/><br/>There are a lot of funny moments as she learns about how the real world differs from the stories she was brought up with, as well as numerous moments where the reality really hits home and she has to deal with the reality of mankind as a flawed, ambiguous species.<br/><br/>A few moments felt quite clichÃ©, such as the ""NOOOOO!"" bodyguard-jump-in-front-of-the-bullet moment in which her mother is killed early on, or the ""the power was always in you, not the weapon"" speech towards the end, but they're not too numerous.<br/><br/>There were also a few facepalm moments such as when the American soldier companion continually implores Diana that taking direct action against the Germans is ""too dangerous"", despite having, the previous day no less, witnessed her walk across no man's land like it was nothing and liberate an entire town almost single handed. Another large part of the story that felt unnecessary was the romance subplot between Diana and the American companion. Earlier in the story, Diana clearly stated that she saw little point in romantic relationships or sex, yet not a week later she seems to have completely changed her mind, and jumps into bed with someone who up until that point has lied to her, mislead her, and continues to question her abilities despite, as I said before, having literally just seen her stroll across no man's land with next to no difficulty and liberate an entire town. A feat which included crushing a tank like a beer can. Why would she be interested in him? He's a good character, and has great intentions, but I can't see how he would have won her over. I felt like her absolute morality and virtue, and the development of those qualities was for more interesting than the romance side of the plot.<br/><br/>On the good side, the action sequences were superbly shot and visually amazing. The character of Diana was charming and engaging as we saw her go from someone who saw only good in mankind, to someone who was faced with the dark reality of humankind, to reconciling that by seeing the good in people in a dark time and sticking to her convictions against great odds. The supporting characters were all unique and distinct in their characterization, with the soldiers Diana travels with providing some great comedic moments, as well as some very moving ones. The villains were a little more flat and cookie cutter, but they were presented and developed enough to form a solid disdain for. I genuinely didn't see the reveal of the true mastermind villain coming, and the final showdown was satisfying and suitably epic.<br/><br/>The conclusion was well presented and emotional, leaving me wanting more from this character, which I think is the goal with any movie of this genre. I hope to see a return from these characters, and feel there is a lot to work from moving forward, as Diana is a character with pretty much endless possibility given her nature.<br/><br/>Overall, I had a blast, and would definitely see it again. I'm glad to see DC putting out a movie more on the level of their peak during the Dark Knight series, and I'm hopeful to see continued high quality comic book action from them in the future."

","Loved this movie. I was one of those skeptical people after Superman vs. Batman. I was heartened by the choice of Director Patty Jenkins. As the cast started rounding out and names like David Thewlis started popping up I became more hopeful. This film far exceeded my expectations. Gal Gadot was, of course, everything she was supposed to be and more: strong while still being feminine, engaging, smart, believable and of course beautiful. Robin Wright who I mistakenly had thought was going to play her mother was incredible. Jenkins knows women and obviously respects them. The Amazons were racially mixed and that was a welcome surprise that shouldn't be overlooked. Chris Pine is so reliable. He anchored his portrayal of Steve Trevor in charm, longing, and humor. His chemistry with Gal Gadot worked thru and thru. Of course, David Thewlis couldn't give a bad performance if he tried and Lucy Davis was perfect as Etta Candy. The big question of how they were going to deal with the time frame and get her back to the Justice League and Superman vs. Batman era was answered in the first five minutes. Jenkins knows women and obviously respects them. I thought the fight scenes were shot with originality and purpose. Not once did I mix up who was who or lose sight of Wonder Woman. Patty Jenkins could teach some of these other directors a thing or two about staging. Way back when I was a reader of comic books and knew Wonder Woman's story thru and thru and was not offended by any changes this adaptation brought. In fact, I thought unlike some liberties that were taken in the past, they were an improvement. Sticking with my usual review practice of (trying to) not give anything away I will simply say: Go see this one. you won't be disappointed."
"Shonsu","9","5","13","16 June 2017"," The absolute best movie of the DCEU so far
","First impression? Wow. Second impression? Wow.<br/><br/>This is what Man of Steel should have been. Wonder Woman is a better Superman movie than the one we got. It has heart, it has style, it has hope, it has love, it has comedy, it has action. Patti Jenkins did a fantastic job directing this movie. This is not a great female superhero film. It's not a great superhero film. It is a great film.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot plays a tremendous Diana Prince. Lilly Aspell plays an adorable young Diana. I feel like she nailed it as well. Not only was she very cute, but she showed a lot of the same determination that Diana shows. The other Amazons were also really good. Patti made a good choice having all the extras be real life athletes and such play the parts. Every single one of them look like they could kick your ass.<br/><br/>I feel Steve's introduction was handled well, and the interaction between him and her was perfect. Like the film itself, it had heart, style, laughter, and love. Not that the it made a big deal about them loving each other. It was done very organically in my opinion. You could see and feel the connection growing between the two of them, but it never felt that it was over done.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved Lucy Davis as Etta. This is another good quality on display here. It's still done in a ""realistic"" sort of way. Etta is still a strong woman, but she is still a woman of her time. She's not weak at all, in fact she is quite strong. But she doesn't suddenly become a hero just because she's a woman. She's stronger than you might expect, but not in an exaggerated way. Instead she's also quite human. Cute and funny, yes, but still a woman from that era.<br/><br/>Which brings me to another point. I'll admit I had some doubts about how awesome this would be. The hype from some of the more hard-core feminists made me worry that it was going to be a typical ""strong woman"" movie. The ones where the women can do everything and the men are just bumbling idiots (to be fair, this does happen the other way around, and it's irritating then too). But Patti didn't do that.<br/><br/>It is a female led superhero movie, but it doesn't feel like it was directed that way. Instead Patti just focused on making a good movie. Yes, the star is female, Yes, the director is female. And yes, there are quite a few powerful women, but the kicker is that it wasn't the goal. It wasn't even really the heart of the movie. It doesn't feel like there's any ""agenda"". It's just a very well done movie.<br/><br/>Diana is very clearly the star (as she should be) and doesn't take a back seat to Steve at all. However, he is definitely not worthless. He's still a very competent soldier and Diana would have run into serious problems if she had tried to go solo. Which makes sense, she is unfamiliar with our world. She has spent her entire life on Themyscira and was clearly naive about our world.<br/><br/>Which humanized her. She was clearly a goddess and a powerful being, but unlike Man of Steel, she was shown to have heart and was someone you could relate to. Or as Patti put it, she's a warrior and a goddess, but she's still a woman. And there's nothing wrong with that! I've known similar women in my life. Women who seem about as girly as a pile of mud, but offer them flowers or something pretty and they get all giddy. Not that Diana gets giddy, but she shows clear signs of still being a woman. Despite the fact that she could kill just about anyone. Back to the movie itself.<br/><br/>I also feel that it is very well paced. There's action before it ever gets boring. There's well placed and appropriate dialogue. There's a variety of emotions and scenery. This film very much stands out from the rest of the DCEU. The other films so far have seemed rather dark and dreary, this film has hope. There are dark and dreary parts, but they are interspersed with light and beauty. It has balance, something lacking in the rest of the DCEU offerings.<br/><br/>OK, so that's a partial list of my praises for the movie (Did I mention it's awesome?). Now on to the critiques.<br/><br/>Most of them are minor and are basically common movie complaints. The first battle scene was pretty cool, but I felt the Amazonians came across as a bit stupid. Which they wouldn't be. Couple of other small things like that here and there, but nothing particularly memorable.<br/><br/>Except for the ending. The final fight. It had some cool parts and it was well choreographed, but it didn't feel like it belonged in this movie. It went from Patti's movie to Synder's movie. It's possible Snyder wasn't involved at all in the final fight sequence, but it certainly felt like he was. Compared to the rest of the movie this was mostly lackluster and rather typical. I'm not saying it was horrible, it just isn't nearly as good as the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Overall I easily give this a 9/10. It's good enough that I watched it twice and thoroughly enjoyed it both times.<br/><br/>People who should watch this movie.<br/><br/>People who like comic book movies and/or superheroes People who like strong female heroes People who like movies set in a war zone People who like movies with great dialogue Â… People who like movies."

","Wonder Woman is, as it seems after the first critic reviews, movie- goers' impressions and financial success, an answer to the age old question asked not just by DC fans, but also critics, film lovers and Hollywood itself - Can DC make good movies (again)? After seeing Wonder Woman last night I can say that Marvel might have a tougher opponent than we've thought. So yes, DC is back! And who do we have to thank? It would take long to describe all the positive aspects of this film; ranging from the script which isn't rough at all - the dialogue flows smoothly, it's not trying to be ""Marvel funny"", and therefore feels real almost to the point of losing the feeling of watching a movie; to fitting, this time even colorful sets, great action pieces and other scenes, and to the biggest stars - the actors. Gal Gadot is a perfect choice. As Wonder Woman she's highly likable, true, convincing, strong but not independent, and she works great with co-actor Chris Pine, who is at the very top with his performance, right next to Gadot. The side characters vary from underdeveloped, yet believable to completely unimportant. Luckily, the movie doesn't suffer from this. We can point out two flaws. Usually Marvel has poorly written villains but now it seems DC tried to beat them at that. No worries. But then there's the CGI which gets heavy at times. All in all the flaws are overshadowed by the good. Now the question is how will Justice League do. If I tie this to a line from the film:""Im both frightened and aroused."""
"mitchell5954","9","5","13","14 June 2017"," The First Good DCEU Movie
","Wonder Woman is the newest entry in the DCEU line-up. Amazingly, it's the first truly great film in this universe; I'm surprised and delighted to say. Man of steel I like, but it has its glaring faults, especially in the third act. BVS has its moments but it is a bad film overall. Suicide Squad is just horrible. It was one of the worst movie theater experiences I've had. Thankfully, this film is legitimately good. It not only has great action, but also a plot that makes coherent sense, characters with personality I actually like, and heart. Wonder Woman is basically a mix of Richard Donner's Superman and Captain America the First Avenger. Like Superman, the film is an epic that covers the highlights of Diana's (Wonder Woman) life on her isolated island of amazons, up until becoming a superhero. The film is also a period piece, taking place primarily in a war-torn setting, like Captain America. This time, it's World War I instead of WWII. When Steve Trevor, the first man to set foot on the island, crash lands there he tells Diana about the war outside in the world of man. Diana decides to go with him to destroy Ares, the God of War and stop the war. The rest of the film is basically that, with some character expansion and growth in between. I cannot think of a major fault with this film. It delivered in every way it was supposed to. One minor complaint is that the battles, especially early on, were very slow-motion heavy. Slow-motion has been milked to death since the Matrix, and I'm getting sick of it. It's not a huge issue, but it bothered me a bit. The villains are not the strongest either, which has been a trend in superhero films lately. Other than that the action was on-point, as was the effects, cinematography, and music. Wonder Woman's them in particular was amazing. I think it's one of the best superhero themes to date, up there with Superman's and Iron Man's. The acting is on-point in the film as well from everyone in the cast. I've always been a fan of Chris Pine. He did fine in the new Star Trek films and he was great in Unstoppable, which is underrated. I will say this is probably his best performance yet. Gal Gadot ultimately does a good job as Wonder Woman. I found her a bit wooden in BVS. She was still a bit wooden in the beginning of this film as well, which had me somewhat worried. However, as the film progresses, she does come into the role and gives a worthwhile performance. What this film truly has in its favor is that it has heart, which has been sorely lacking in the DCEU movies. What makes the majority of MCU movies loved my many is that they have heart to them. The characters feel like people rather than plot devices like in BVS or Suicide Squad. While the majority of the film had a rather downbeat tone, it had an upbeat message and feel, which the other DCEU movies up until now didn't really have. Overall, Wonder Woman is certainly a step in the right direction for the DCEU. Let's just hope Justice League doesn't screw it up. As a fan of the character I'm glad to finally have her adapted on the big screen, and done well."

","I took my 11 year old daughter to see this. She doens't miss a superhero flick. I, on the other hand, have superhero fatigue. I thought this would be a gaudy, cheesy Thor-fest.<br/><br/>But this movie absolutely delighted both of us. It held my attention all the way through, and I really pulled for the characters. Gal Gadot was born to play that role. It's an understatement to say she's gorgeous. But I was really amazed with how vulnerable she was for the first half of the film. Her naive nature was very charming as she began to learn the world of humans. Her fascination with Steve T was genuinely humorous. And then, as she witnessed atrocities, her disgust and sorrow was believable.<br/><br/>Diana was a warrior and a half. The battle scenes were impressive and innovative. She seemed to get stronger as the movie went on, reaching Superman levels of power. While her fellow Amazons were felled by bullets, she seemed more bullet-proof. Her final victory over Ares was something to witness.<br/><br/>On the negative side, it was too long. Could've used a nip and tuck to trim out 15 minutes. And the bad guys were quite broad and campy. The General was almost mustache twirling evil. And Ares was played by a doughy guy who actually had a huge mustache that he could've twirled. He was mediocre as the all-powerful God that Diana has to take down. That's the goofy guy from Harry Potter after all. Not exactly a commanding God-like actor. Anyway...<br/><br/>Check it out. You'll love it. Best superhero movie since the Dark Knight."

","When Wonder Woman made her first appearance in 'All-Star Comics' 8 (October 1941) she plunged straight into the Second World War. The film version differs: *her* world war is the *first*. That's not the only difference: gone is William Moulton Marston's Paradise Island, populated by warrior Amazons preaching the virtues of loving submission mixed with bondage and a little light spanking; in comes Greg Potter and George PÃ©rez's Themyscira, whose Amazons spend their days honing their warcraft. The film opens there, trots quickly through the young Diana's childhood (with an annex of Amazonian history) before we arrive at the main story: American (but working for the Brits) spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash-lands off the island's coast, unwittingly leading a German warboat to discover the island. In the first of many impressively-staged battle scenes, Diana (Gal Gadot), Trevor and the Amazonian swords 'n' sandals military repel the Germans and Diana, convinced that the war is the fulfilment of Greek war god Ares' plans, elects to travel to ""Man's World"".<br/><br/>There is some humour: eg Pine and Gadot re-enacting the old 'man rises naked from bath just as woman walks into room' schtick. But on the whole this is a fairly dark film, such as when Diana witnesses life in the trenches and Belgian villagers being killed with poison gas. (So no ""Fighting for your rights/In your satin tights"" here!) I guessed which one of the 'goodies' would turn out to be a 'baddie' (after all, it always happens in this sort of film), but the individual's motivations were a refreshing change from the usual desire to rule the world. Acting-wise, the statuesque Gadot of course looks the part and portrays a confident young woman whose innocence at the ways of Man's World never becomes annoying. In the supporting roles, stand-outs for me are Robin Wright, icy-cold but ferociously sexy as Amazonian general (and Diana's aunt) Antiope; and SaÃ¯d Taghmaoui, whose romantic, life-and-soul-of-the-party sidekick to Trevor hides secret ambitions. I wonder if for David Thewlis this was a 'got to pay the mortgage' sort of job, but he still adds value as a crusty British official.<br/><br/>Quite why the decision was made to set the film during the First World War I do not know; however, it gives a nice period feel to the piece and, of course, opens the tantalising possibility of a WWII-set sequel. I have a couple of quibbles: on isolated occasions the CGI flying sequences look distinctly animated; the closing 'love will conquer anything' speech is resoundingly clunky; and the implication that Diana and Trevor have sex is just wrong! But on the whole this is a very enjoyable film - I have not seen any of the other DC movies but the widely-expressed opinion that this is better than the rest does not surprise me."

","Thank you DC and Warner Bros. for finally getting the message. Thank you for finally figuring out that the reason Marvel Studios movies work isn't because they have a fun soundtrack or because they do a bunch of cameos, but because they actually make decent movies that are true to the spirit of their heroes. Thank you for finally making a live- action Wonder Woman movie. And last, but certainly not least, thank you for making a female led superhero movie that doesn't suck.<br/><br/>As you might've been able to guess, ""Wonder Woman"" is an astonishingly good movie. After the disasters of ""Batman v Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"", it seemed like the studio had no idea how to run a successful superhero franchise. This was particularly sad since Warner Bros. essentially invented the genre with 1978's ""Superman"". However, ""Wonder Woman"" dodged all the problems that made ""Batman v Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"" so abysmally bad.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" gives us a true to comic book version of the character without any shame. It's dark sure, but it also has levity. It embraces Greek mythologies and a hidden island of warrior women completely. It even manages to mix two of her origins into the movie seamlessly.<br/><br/>Director Patty Jenkins and screenwriter Allan Feinberg must be given the most credit. Many might be tempted to handle the silly aspects of Wonder Woman's story with a wink to the audience. But instead they treat it with all the gravity needed to give the world a Wonder Woman that is both strong and human. <br/><br/>Part of that also comes down to the performance of Gal Gadot. Although sometimes her line delivery leaves a bit to be desired, she carries herself as a hero. The whole cast here should be commended. Chris Pine's Steve Trevor is a good man in a world where sometimes good men must make hard decisions. David Thewlis and Robin Wright also provide strong roles that essentially just push the plot forward, but it feels natural here.<br/><br/>I actually find myself wondering if ""Wonder Woman"" is actually as good as I thought or if my expectations for the DCEU are so rock bottom that the movie appears all that much better when compared to other entrants. No matter what, the fact that Wonder Woman finally presents a strong female superhero and is, at the very least, a decent movie makes it worthy to check out.<br/><br/>The question we now have to ask, is Wonder Woman the course correction the DCEU desperately needed, or was it just a fluke? With Justice League is just around the corner, we'll know the answer soon."

"ryanskywalker-87402","8","5","13","9 June 2017"," ""Only love can truly save the world""
","Wonder Woman is the latest installment in Warner Bros. DC Extended Universe, the first female led superhero film in over a decade (we can try to forget that Catwoman and Elektra happened....but they did) and also the first female director to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist (the second in comic book films behind Lexi Alexander for 2008's Punisher: War Zone). From these points, plus the fact that the films within the DCEU haven't received the critical claim that I'm sure the studio hoped to gain and what the fans hoped to achieve, there seemed to be a question of how much pressure is riding on Wonder Woman to be appease both the fans and the critics of the DCEU, let alone the number of people that have been waiting over seventy-five years for her to have her big screen outing. Wonder Woman is set before the other installments of the DCEU, taking place during World War I. One day just off the shores of Themyscira, an Allied intelligence officer, Steve Trevor, crashes his plane and warns the Amazons of the war to end all wars that is taking place outside of their bubble. Shocked to hear of the atrocities and casualties of the war, Diana decides to go with Trevor to the front of the war and fight for the helpless and discover her true destiny.<br/><br/>I had relatively high expectations leading up to the release of this film due to how well I thought the trailers were done and I must say that the film even managed to surpass them. The film starts off strong introducing the audience to the island of Themyscira and the Amazon warriors that live on it, telling us the history behind their existence which on paper sounds completely ridiculous and yet with Patty Jenkins at the helm, that origin is fully embraced and isn't afraid to make a joke at its own expense to generate a laugh or two. Jenkins has made it clear that she was influenced by Richard Donner's Superman and when you're watching the film you can clearly see shades of that influence, from showing us the heroes homeland in the first act, to the superhero figure coming out as a beacon of hope in a grey world and the character gets to shine brightly within the World War I setting. Following Diana's journey to mankind's world and seeing her naivety about seeking out immediately to help those in need within a black and white viewpoint about right and wrong, whilst learning of the evil that men are capable of, actually feels refreshing in the landscape of comic book films we've had as of late. The films key strength and glue that keeps the audience invested is the relationship between Diana and Steve Trevor. Both of them fold into the 'fish out of water' mould that perfectly compliment each other as they are both bemused by the others origins as one has never seen a man before and the other has never met a....well, a God. Their journey throughout the film feels more authentic than forced and that's due to the terrific chemistry that they have together on screen. Steve is, in his words an 'above average' man that is more than capable of handling himself within the settings of the war but can't help but deliver some sharp sense of humour as he stares in awe when Diana begins to unleash her powers and I thought Chris Pine gave a really good performance in the role. Gal Gadot on the other hand.....I thought she was excellent as Diana. Much has questioned about her ability as an actress capable of playing the role since she was cast back in 2013, rather unfairly in my opinion. Here she manages to find the balance of bringing innocence, sincerity and badassery to the role and with the action sequences she has and the material that she has to work with, this is comfortably her best performance to date. From the supporting cast I thought Robin Wright's performance as General Antiope stood out the most for me, though I did also like Connie Nielsen, David Thewlis and Saïd Taghmaoui. There's a few scenes that stood out to me, with the action sequence that will be referred to as No Man's Land I thought was perfectly done, from the buildup of the scene to the pacing of the sequence and the editing and then there's the small moments such as Steve teaching Diana how to dance or sway really well. <br/><br/>Even within the positively, there's a few issues I have with the film that many comic book films fall victim to. The key one being the use of special effects. While it relies heavily on it in the final acts battle scene, it feels more justified than say how the CGI is handled on a battle scene on Themyscira where it is terribly noticeable to the point of distracting, to the rather poor use of green screen as two characters are having a conversation with one another. The other issue is that the films main villains, as in General Ludendorff and mad scientist Doctor Poison are just too flat and one-dimensional as we're giving nothing to develop even hatred towards them and one certain aspect of Lundendorff is never really addressed thinking back on the film that's actually bugging me. The performances from Danny Huston and Elena Anaya were rather 'too theatrical' at one point, involving one scene and a group of Germans. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a wonderfully inspiring and compassionate superhero film that is a breath of fresh air in the genre thanks to Patty Jenkins at the helm. The action sequences are more often than not fantastic to watch and the performances from Gadot and Pine keep you invested. Her time is now indeed."

","""I am both frightened and aroused,"" says Sameer after Wonder Woman tosses a gun-wielding bully across the floor of the pub where she has been introduced to Sameer and other allies by her main ally, Steve Trevor. <br/><br/>I am not a big fan of super-hero movies, but this one has remarkable acting, writing, direction as well as impressive sets and costumes. (It is set during World War I.)<br/><br/>The opening scenes are richly imaginative as they take place on the mystical island where the Amazons live and where Diana (Wonder Woman) has been raised. The world of young Diana is sun-drenched and Greek-ified and establishes the mythological universe that informs Wonder Woman and all that she does for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>After Steve Trevor is chased into the island's airspace and has to be rescued from his Imperial German pursuers by Diana and all of the Amazons, more and more of the world of (circa) 1918 is evoked. Diana goes with him back to Europe and becomes Wonder Woman as she battles the German Army and a fancifully villainous version of General Erich Ludendorff, one of the chief leaders of Germany during the war. (Though he would go on - historically speaking - to be largely responsible for introducing a nobody named Adolf Hitler to many of the influential people who helped the future dictator in his rise to power.)<br/><br/>There are formulaic action scenes that get Wonder Woman and her band of allies into and out of all kinds of predictable trouble. These are well-done dramatically with the help of bold special effects.<br/><br/>Most of all, the casting is terrific with the breath-taking Gal Gadot, as the title character, holding up the movie in all of her many scenes.<br/><br/>There is good chemistry between her and co-star Chris Pine as Steve Trevor. Their band of allies are entertainingly quirky if often ineffectual.<br/><br/>The most grievous fault is that the villains are too numerous and their villainy too spread out among them, and the Big Bad is only introduced at the very end. Almost anticlimactically.<br/><br/>The battle tactics of the Amazons are inexplicably poor. I am reminded of the titular protagonists in ""13 Assassins"" (2010) who shoot arrows from the roof at their enemies below until they voluntarily stop and jump down into their enemies' midst because their samurai pride won't allow them to take advantage of anything better than ten to one odds. In ""Wonder Woman"", no explanation is given for the Amazons giving up their similar but greater high-ground advantage over the Germans in the first battle sequence of the movie.<br/><br/>I found most of the humor organic, not strained, and the preachiness that some talk about was really kept to a minimum. (Native American grievances are alluded to and Wonder Woman recognizes that the Germans did not start the war alone. As presented, though, these things are acknowledged even by many conservative historians.)<br/><br/>When Trevor's secretary describes her obedience in her duties, Wonder Woman says, ""Where I come from that is called slavery"". But this is funny, and, otherwise, Wonder Woman takes the advice of her allies in fitting into a ""patriarchal"" society.<br/><br/>A big, fun, escapist movie with some vivid touches of realism for atmosphere. I particularly liked the scene where Wonder Woman, the super-hero and goddess, rises above the historically accurate portrayal of the stalemate along the Western Front to march across No-Man's Land. (Though maybe there were too many trees and not enough barbed wire. The trees were dead and short but should have been non-existent due to frequent barrages.) She single-handedly defeats the German defenders, inspiring not only her band of allies but most of a British regiment to follow her. (If such a miraculous, un-ordered and unplanned attack had the faintest chance of working, it would have been because the higher-ups did not spoil it with a preliminary artillery barrage, which always tended to warn the enemy you were coming and tore up No Man's Land in ways that made it more, not less, impassable)."
"jquinlan19","10","5","13","6 June 2017"," The best DC movie yet!
","The tale of Wonder Woman's origin, training, and the philosophy of the Amazons is very interesting to those of us who immersed ourselves in the myths of the gods. Even Shakespeare used them in his plays, like ""Twelfth Night"", and references to them are in many, many novels. Statues of Zeus abound in palaces and museums everywhere. Hopefully young people who see this film will be inspired to read about them and widen their literary horizons. That said, of course this is a mythic tale, but what a heroic one! Casting is simply perfect. Premises are intelligent. Action is unbelievably good! There's humor, but a lot of pathos. Mistakes are made, but humans are portrayed sympathetically. Steve Trevor is a definite hero and worthy of Wonder Woman's love and respect. The horror of war is fully shown, and probably children will find it too violent. Definitely not for the under-10s. Women are portrayed with respect for their abilities and sensibilities. All in all, a must-see movie for everyone who has ever read a DC comic. And everyone else, too."

","Just came home from a 3D screening of the movie. First of all Wonder Woman is the best DCEU movie so far, there's no question about that. H*ll, the longer the movie had rolled the more I thought that it is equivalent to ones by Marvel - if not even better! Sure there are bits and pieces that I personally would've left to the cutting room but those were minor things and didn't bother me much in the end... But then came the Grand Finale... F*ck! Why couldn't they let ""Ares"" be The Ares and _bluntly_ smash the fact to her face that people are doing these things on their own? No, they had to add some useless CGI crap with bad dialog and a boring villain to make her see this and that and to realize that and this. With a better / shorter ending the movie could've easily been 9/10 but now it is just more or less a solid 8/10.<br/><br/>However to my eyes there is even more pressure on Justice League now!

"keith-w8888","2","6","17","16 June 2017"," Why does DC suck and Marvel rock? I just don't get it...
","First off, I no longer believe in the 'ratings' that IMDb have - there is no way this movie got rated as an 8.1 - no way. It was rubbish. The only redeeming feature was Chris Pine - who is a class act - but even he couldn't save this. It was too badly written, badly directed and badly executed. Gal Gadot is just awful, wooden, with that thick, ugly Israeli accent - that's not Greek, that's Israeli and we all know why she's there. Catapulted into 'stardom' by Hollywood's racial supremacy agenda, not unlike Amy Tumer and Sarah Silverman. Gal has no presence, little talent, she's not physical, despite the hype, she's pedestrian. Compare this to Sofia Boutella's performance as Ahmanet in The Mummy - where she goes from seductress to evil rage monster seamlessly and where, during her escape she climbs her chains upside down to free herself, there's no CGI, no stunt woman, she actually does it herself. It makes the scene electrifying. But, back to this mediocrity, the plot trivialises history, they do keep a final 'surprise' until the end, but it's hardly exciting, coming so late in the movie you know it's not going to amount to much. The other supporting roles are just weak and underdeveloped, even as baddies, it comes from the 'spell it out to the morons' school of directing. No subtly, no perception, just formulaic writing aiming at an imagined target audience. The ONLY DC franchise I have seen that rocks is the Lego Batman Movie - that was awesome - an unrelenting joy ride of humour and fun - with a moral imperative for kids and lots of dark adult humour that goes right over the kids' heads. In this movie they should have paid more attention to the making of the movie rather than the packaging... But the DC franchise just never seems to learn. Mind you the DC Comics were always lacklustre."

"ericstevenson","10","6","17","10 June 2017"," Best movie of the year
","You know, I really did misjudge the DC Cinematic Universe. When ""Man Of Steel"" came out, I thought it was just alright. I knew ""Batman Vs. Superman"" would be a disappointment and didn't have high hopes for ""Suicide Squad"". I had little faith in this movie and boy, was I wrong. Is there some way to spell a clap in this review? I became quite familiar with the Wonder Woman mythos upon watching the 2009 direct to video film and I knew this movie couldn't be better than it. And you know what? I stand by that opinion. This still isn't as good as that movie.<br/><br/>Ever since the first female superhero movie came out in 1984 with ""Supergirl"" we've had nothing but bombs with these characters for over thirty years. Having come fresh from Superhero Month, I am so glad to have seen this. It was worth the price. I was always myself confused as to how there was never a theatrically released Wonder Woman movie and I guess they just needed all the time they could take with this true masterpiece. This movie features Wonder Woman, although she's never referred to that, only as Diana. I guess ""Princess Diana"" is an awkward title now.<br/><br/>At first, I thought this film took place in World War II given how that's when nearly all war films took place. Instead, it was World War I and I thank the creators for the variety. The movie's plot is that a pilot named Steve has crash landed on Wonder Woman's island, but is followed by Germans as he was a spy trying to infiltrate them. We get the first great fight sequence with the Amazons fighting the Germans. It's easy to recognize the main villain Ares, whom she believes to be the source of the conflict.<br/><br/>Steve on the other hand, finds this silly and thinks that all of this conflict is caused by the true spirit of mankind. In the end, it turns out they're BOTH right. Ares is indeed among the Germans, but he insists that he just aided the humans and it's their doing that the world is at war. This film has absolutely fantastic battle sequences with such strong willed characters. It takes chances, as we actually see Steve pull off a heroic sacrifice in the end and he stays dead. Yeah, I wanted to see them together but this is made all the more effective.<br/><br/>I kept thinking that Batman or Superman was going to show up some time in this movie. Maybe with the Flash time traveling, they would have cameos or at least the Flash himself would. This is what bothered me about the other movies. They just had these random cameos to try to promote other movies. I am so happy this has none of that and is simply a movie featuring Wonder Woman. Zack Synder really impressed me and it's so easy to say that is his best work because it is. This is better than all other female superhero movies combined and is something everyone can and should watch. Thanks for the hope. ****"
"Hellmant","10","6","17","6 June 2017"," Really happy with the progress it's helped advance for women in film!
","'WONDER WOMAN': Five Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>The new superhero film based on the classic DC Comics character (of the same name), and the fourth movie in the DC Extended Universe. It's an origin story starring Gal Gadot as the titular character (a role she previously played in last year's 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE'). In this film she's an Amazon princess (in the year 1918) that aids an American pilot who crash lands on her home island of Themyscira (a place only inhabited by Amazonian women). She helps him try to stop the German Empire, from conquering the world during World War I, and she must leave her home for the first time in order to do so; by traveling with the pilot to London (where she becomes Wonder Woman for the first time). The film costars Chris Pine, Connie Nielson, Robin Wright, David Thewlis, Danny Huston and Elena Anaya. It was directed by Patty Jenkins (who also helmed the 2003 critically acclaimed female serial killer flick 'MONSTER') and it was written by Allan Heinberg, Zack Snyder (who also co-produced the movie) and Jason Fuchs. The blockbuster was made on a budget of $149 million, and it's the first summer tent pole superhero film directed by a woman. It's also received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, it was voted the most anticipated summer blockbuster of 2017 as well (in a recent pole), and it's exceeded all expectations at the Box Office (including becoming the biggest opening weekend ever for a film directed by a woman). I think it's one of the best superhero movies ever made.<br/><br/>The story begins in modern day, with Wonder Woman (Gadot) recollecting on her past as a young Amazonian princess named Diana (Emily Carey). Diana is taught to be a powerful warrior, in case the God of War ever returns to the hidden island they live on. A United States Army Air Service Captain, named Steve Trevor (Pine), crash lands on their island and is being pursued by German military forces. After stopping the attacking soldiers, the Amazonian people interrogate Steve. They then learn about the war, and the threat it poses to the entire planet. Diana feels that it's her duty to go with Steve, and defeat the God of War (if she can find him).<br/><br/>The film is a heck of a lot of fun; it's action-packed and the 'fish out of water' comedy scenes are hilariously classic (they're really well done). The movie is also surprisingly emotional, I even cried a little towards the end of the film. They couldn't have found a better director than Jenkins to direct this movie too. She really knows the character well, and she has a lot of passion for telling her story obviously. They couldn't have cast a better actress than Gadot in the title role either. She's perfect as Wonder Woman, and I think she gives the best performance of the year (so far). She's definitely a huge movie star waiting to happen; she's breathtakingly gorgeous and amazingly talented as well. I'm amazed at how much I actually love this film (I wasn't even excited to see it until recently too). It really blew me away, and I'm really happy with the progress it's helped advance for women in film!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/221789603"

But as the first film in a new push toward more female action leads, Wonder Woman is memorable despite being unremarkable."
"regula1","9","6","17","1 June 2017"," Best superhero movie ever? No. But third place is not bad at all...
","If we were to rank all of the modern superhero movies, and by that I mean starting with 2000's X-Men, which was the first true modern superhero movie after the glory days of Tim Burton's Batman and Christopher Reeve's Superman, number one would probably have to be The Dark Knight, followed closely by Captain America: The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman would be third on that list, and since we live in an age overflowing with superhero films, third place is nothing to be ashamed of.<br/><br/>This film is, in a word, epic. Not in the same way as a film like Lord of the Rings is epic, with large scope and breathtaking battle scenes. Rather, its epic feel comes from the great performances and sheer raw emotion Gal Gadot conveys as the titular heroine Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>The film takes place as a flashback, beginning with Diana being sent a photo sometime after the events of Batman v. Superman from Bruce Wayne, a photo teased in that previous film, and brings us to Diana's childhood on the island of the Amazons, guardians of the world tasked with one day defeating Ares, the god of war, should he ever return.<br/><br/>One day, Diana sees a plane crash off the shores of her island. The pilot, Steve Trevor, played excellently by Chris Pine, informs Diana of the war going on in Europe, the War to End All Wars aka World War I.<br/><br/>She then embarks on her quest to fulfill her people's mission, for she believes Ares has returned and is at the heart of this war, and if she defeats him, the war will end. Thus begins her transformation into the heroine that would be known as Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>This film had a lot riding on it, mainly because the DC Extended Universe has had to play catch-up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the past four years, with Marvel having a five year head start (Iron Man came out in 2008, whereas Man of Steel, the DCEU's first film, came out in 2013).<br/><br/>Therefore, it's all the more impressive that a cinematic universe still in its infancy, and after the relative disappointments of Batman v. Superman and Suicide Squad, can produce such a strong origin story of a superhero that many may not know too much about.<br/><br/>Where this movie shines is the chemistry between Gadot and Pine, and the levity that comes from misunderstandings, a common comedic trope but it feels so genuine between these two that it feels fresh.<br/><br/>Also, props to Hans Zimmer, who, while not composing the score for this film, made the unofficial Wonder Woman theme (refer to ""Is She With You?"" from the Batman v. Superman soundtrack). Whenever it plays in this film, it sends chills down my spine because that means something bad-ass is going to go down. Way to go!<br/><br/>Where this movie may falter is in the inevitable comparisons. There's no getting around the fact that this film, for all of its great qualities, bears much resemblance to Captain America: The First Avenger, due to its period setting origin story, among other things.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this film is a testament to what the DCEU can be, and I can only hope that Justice League lives up the the very, VERY high standard Wonder Woman has now set."

","I have to say that, when I walked into this movie I didn't have any great expectations. But walking out of the theater, I was amazed at how great this movie really was. Gal Gadot was excellent in this film. I couldn't see anyone else playing the role of Wonder Woman. Chris Pine was also really good in this film, as Steve Trevor. Honestly I loved everything about this movie. The plot, the action sequences, and even Wonder Woman's costume.<br/><br/>I never really cared for Wonder Woman until this movie came out. It showed how Wonder Woman is such a strong woman. Especially the scene where she just comes out of the dugout, taking the stage and getting things done. As the men all follow behind her. I can say this is probably one of my favorite movies now. And is the best movie so far, out of the DCEU. Batman vs. Superman was terrible until Wonder Woman came in. I also find her as a huge role model for any woman who doesn't feel like they can accomplish anything. And remember ""It's about what you believe. And I believe in love. Only love will truly save the world."""

"andy-392-495352","1","4","10","28 January 2018"," Truly Awful
","Probably the worst movie I have ever seen and I have sat through some rubbish. In fact I don't mind watching shlock when it's super low budget and that's the expectation but WW was a multi-million dollar 'blockbuster' and on that basis it should be trounced. <br/><br/>WW epitomises the worst aspects of modern film-making: paper-thin plots designed around set-pieces and action sequences with the laziest effort to make things hang together even for five minutes. There is 'suspending your disbelief' and then there's insulting the audiences intelligence. It might have worked well as a plot for a music video.<br/><br/>It's so bad its hard to know where to start. It's not that the direction or cast are spectacularly bad though I bet they are all thanking the stars that WW didn't make it through to any serious film-awards as this will be one they will want to forget. David Thewlis particularly feels a sad waste for such a film. Pine was built for these kind of roles as one can never take him seriously anyway (I think he's perfect as Shatner's Kirk).<br/><br/>Gadot is bearable but I'd only give her hammy over-acting a pass as she is trying to demonstrate the naivety of the character. This could have been handled much more subtley to better effect. If anything the praise should go to her stunt doubles and the editors for making her appear the slightest bit athletic.<br/><br/>Whilst Snyder is the writer it feels like he proxy-directed the whole thing as it has all his hallmarks. Its not that he doesn't have his moments it's just he comes across as a one-trick pony rather than a seasoned director capable of delivering what the story needs. On that basis I'm not sure what Patty Jenkins achieved herself with this. Definitely a huge step backwards from Monster (but then not much else in the last 14 years?).<br/><br/>The setting as world war one was a terrible mistake and contradiction. I could understand a really simple-stupid movie aimed at kids but it clearly isn't. Mixing candy-floss nonsense with the dark ravages of war just to make a protracted point (men are evil). Deaths are frequent and all too easy which often feels like poor taste.<br/><br/>The characters are all stereotypes, paperthin and cliched - nothing original at all which adds to the boredom as you genuinely feel you have seen everything before.<br/><br/>The pacing is poor and again this is poor storytelling and scripting. There have been very many successful films which have told a back story interweaved through the experiences of the main character as an alternative to dragging through an hour just to reach the main acts of the film. You can wander off and make a cup of tea several times and you won't really miss anything of subtance either.<br/><br/>Even the action is awful.. typically over-used Snyder-esque slow-mo sequences. Used sparingly this can be a great technique to emphasise a moment (as employed within the Matrix) but use it as the main effect and it drags the pace of everything down and loses that natural excitement of keeping up with fast complex action. You never reach the end of a point and think 'wow', what did I just see.<br/><br/>CGI generally has come good over the last 10 years, really good, but this is back to some of the cheesiest effects you will see on film. And the more they throw at you the more your brain goes 'meh'. Its like making a 2hr film just composed of CGI explosions - after 2 minutes you'll be bored to tears.<br/><br/>Some will like it - probably those types who can't sit in a cinema for more than a minute without opening another bag of crisps or checking their phone. For them the film will work well as those kind of interruptions won't spoil anything. But if you've got anything else to do with your life today, do that instead."

"Michael_Elliott","Null","4","10","5 November 2017"," Gadot Makes the Film
","Wonder Woman (2017) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Amazonian warrior Diana (Gal Gadot) witnesses a plane crash into an ocean so she rushes to save the pilot (Chris Pine). Soon she realizes that there's some sort of war going on in the outside world and the two travel to London where Diana is going to get to reveal her full powers.<br/><br/>It seems that next to Donald Trump, WONDER WOMAN was the most political discussion held by people on social media in 2017. I must admit that I skipped the movie in theaters and waited for its Blu-ray release and as an outsider I was just shocked at the countless political rants that were going on with the film. I don't plan on getting political in this review but I should also point out that I've never read a comic book in my life. With that said, WONDER WOMAN was certainly a good movie but I'm going to stop well short before calling it great or anything special.<br/><br/>There were some wonderful things throughout the picture and we can start with Gadot. She was certainly the perfect choice for the role as she has the look down as well as the physical need for the role. I thought she perfectly owned every aspect of the role and she was certainly the best thing about the picture. I found Pine to be quite good as well and the two of them had a nice chemistry throughout. The Amazonian world was another good aspect as the look of it was wonderful and it really did come off as a fantasy world. The WWI setting was another plus.<br/><br/>With that said, there really wasn't anything overly original here except for the lead being a woman. In fact, some of the things here I found to be quite lame including the non-stop sexual innuendo that starts right from the start to the very end of the picture. For all the ""she's a great role model for girls"" we certainly got a lot of lame jokes. I'd also argue that the CGI was used way too much. I know CGI is the king of the world in movies but for me when it's used poorly or too much it just takes away from everything on the screen and I thought that happened here.<br/><br/>With that said, WONDER WOMAN is certainly a film that is worth watching but I'm just not going to celebrate it as some sort of great film."

I really liked it, a story, a back story to the central character, excellent Special effects, ignore the obvious naysayers, this is a darn good film."
"tanishanand","7","4","10","4 October 2017"," Despite some minor shortcomings, Wonder Woman is an enjoyable film.
","Wonder Woman is the best DC movie since The Dark Knight Rises. Now that isn't saying much, but it's a fact. The two DCEU movies before Wonder Woman, Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad have been horrendous misfires. Wonder Woman is definitely the breakthrough DC needed.<br/><br/>The best part about Wonder Woman? That's Wonder Woman. Yes, Gal Gadot is now irreplaceable as the titular character. She has executed the role flawlessly. I can not think of anyone else as in her place now. Chris Pine has also done an excellent job. He has truly given a memorable and joyful performance as the male lead. In fact, the excellent performances and direction are the biggest strengths of the film. The setting of World War I is perfectly portrayed with attention to detail.<br/><br/>However, the movie is certainly not flawless. Some of the shortcomings I noticed are:<br/><br/><ul><li>The Climax of the film. While Steve Trevor's death scene is well done, the sequence that follows is largely underwhelming. In fact, the portrayal of Ares himself is quite underwhelming. His presence is felt throughout the film, but in person he is in the movie for less than 20 minutes and isn't at all threatening in the very least. Danny Huston, who plays the other major negative role is sadly one-dimensional and bland. Though in his defense, his role was a bit poorly written in my opinion.</li></ul><br/><br/>-I also felt the pace of the movie slows down unnecessarily at certain scenes. Mainly the boat scene in which Diana and Steve leave Themiscyra. I would have much rather preferred the scene to be a lot briefer. Some portions of the conversation were not important and slowed down the movie. Same goes with the dance scene in the second half. <br/><br/>Despite the quibbles noted above, Wonder Woman is a well-made film. It could have been slightly better, but it's still quite good. And as noted, the performances and the direction are the biggest strengths of the film. Also, I appreciate the lighter tone of the movie, in contrast to the other DCEU movies, which had a very dull tone. The film is a pure origin story and plays no role in any sort of universe-building. <br/><br/>It might not be completely path-breaking, but Wonder Woman is a must-watch, no doubt about it. Watch it for... Wonder Woman."
"FerdinandoLM","4","4","10","14 September 2017"," Childish writing
","Wonder Woman is just another Zack Snyder attempt to bring on cinemas a childish script made by DC. <br/><br/>Hear me out, wonder woman comics character is awesome, but this movie is all about FX and showing how beauty Gal Gadot is. <br/><br/>The movie starts with a young Diana who lives in the Amazon island, protecting people. We'll discover that she is a demi-god but there is no true discovery of that sentence. Only ""hey, my mother made me out of clay and Zeus gave me life"". <br/><br/>When she encounters the human world for the first time there are a lot of contradictions between her actions. Sometimes she seems to be a whole new baby in the world, willing to discover it. Sometimes she seems to be living within it since always.<br/><br/>Let's skip to the enemy: an awful David Thewlis that gives nothing to the movie, that's truly one of the worst villains ever. All that even happens with this villain is the final fight with it. <br/><br/>There are a lot of obnoxious GFX works in this movie. Every jump in action scenes about WW is made in a way that you feel the GFX and feel bad for it. Even slight dodges are done with GFX.<br/><br/>DC is trying in the worst way to copy what Marvel did 10+ years ago, with the technology of today. <br/><br/>Tossing money at the bin is what the studio is truly doing."
"JordanGMorrell","7","4","10","29 June 2017"," Without a doubt a step in the right direction for DC
","Wonder Woman does exactly what Man of Steel and Batman vs. Superman failed to do, this is a quality film. The story, the characters and the setup is the best I have seen from DC since The Dark Knight Rises. The only thing I don't understand is why DC has to have scenes that are so profoundly made of CGI that we as the viewer are almost unable to tell if we are still watching people act or if we accidentally walked into the latest Pixar movie. However I think the reason why this aspect doesn't completely kill the film is because it only takes place for a short period of time. Unlike Man of Steel which makes its use of CGI very prominently known. Wonder Woman is without a doubt moving and personally one of my favorite films of the summer. It is easy to see why this film is loved by millions the second the projector (metaphorical projector of course, we all know most theaters are all digital now) starts to roll. The story is more in focus and even if you aren't the biggest DC fan you can still appreciate this movie. I would highly recommend this movie and even if you don't like it as much as I did then you will at least be entertained so it is worth the watch."
"TinseltownReviews","7","4","10","29 June 2017"," Solid entry in the DCEU and for female-led superhero movies
","While not amazing by any means, Wonder Woman delivers its promise of a strong entry in the DCEU as well as the first truly good female superhero film.<br/><br/>Gadot owns the role as Wonder Woman in the iconic character's first ever live-action adaptation on the big screen, breathing new life in the DCEU with a heroine that is radiant, uplifting, and relatable (a first for DCEU movies). Her performance as Diana Prince the character is very well done and her interpretation of Wonder Woman the warrior is excellent, the noticeably lacking some intensity in the final battle.<br/><br/>Pine's Steve Trevor is a charming and charismatic English spy who has great chemistry with Gadot and gives an overall excellent performance, as does Robin Wright who plays Antiope, Diana's aunt. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast give decent, but highly forgettable performances. Because so much of the film focuses on the core duo, characters like Etta Candy (Trevor's secretary as seen in all the trailers) and the three other members of Trevor's team do not get much focus.<br/><br/>The villain is comparative to the subpar roster of MCU villains that can be summed up as ""fine, but forgettable,"" though there is a twist that is somewhat interesting. Ultimately though, nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>The plot can be considered ""above average Marvel movie"", which is absolutely fine. It's better to have a simple and solid story rather than try too hard to have an overly complex one like previous DCEU films. The pacing of the movie can be compared to that of Rogue One. While the action scenes are better spread out and the movie has a riveting final thirty minutes, a decent portion of the middle is slow and boring. A bit too much time is spent with characters we don't care much about, leaving the movie a bit watered-down.<br/><br/>Immediately noticeable is how saturated, bright, and colorful the film is compared to the previous doom and gloom DCEU movies. Themyscira is an absolutely gorgeous sight to behold and Wonder Woman's beautiful costume truly shines as one of the best looking live-action superhero costumes I've ever seen. The action scenes are fairly well filmed, though the frequent use of slow-motion can get a bit annoying at times.<br/><br/>Read my full review at http://tinseltownreviews.blogspot.com/2017/06/wonder-woman-2017-new- hope-for-dceu-and.html"

","Right, well it was with some mixed anticipation that I went to watch ""Wonder Woman"" in the cinema this weekend. Why? Well, first of all, I am not overly keen on superhero movies, so I had no real incitement or drive for watching this. But then again, I had been told by several people that this was definitely an impressive movie, and one that was well worth the watch even for a non-superhero fan.<br/><br/>I watched ""Wonder Woman"" in 3D in the cinema, which was completely pointless, because there were no outstanding or particularly impressive 3D scenes that made you go ""wow!"" So an ordinary 2D viewing of this movie is recommendable.<br/><br/>I am somewhat familiar with Wonder Woman from the comic books that I read during my childhood, and also having seen a few episodes here and there from the mid-1970s TV show ""Wonder Woman"". So I didn't really have much of any expectations of what the movie had to deliver for it to be worthwhile.<br/><br/>And I must say that I was actually impressed. For a superhero movie then ""Wonder Woman"" turned out to be at the higher end of the scale in terms of being entertaining and watchable.<br/><br/>This was definitely Gal Gadot's movie through and through, because she carried the movie so well with her performance as Diana. She has a very charismatic demeanor and her on-screen appearance just demands attention from the audience. So I think that she has been very well cast for the role of Wonder Woman, and I think it will actually be nice to see her again in upcoming superhero movies.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" was a visual tour-de-force, and the special effects were impressive and worked very well in favor of the movie. Most of the time it felt like you were right there in the movie yourself, because of the believable special and visual effects. And it was an amazing visual experience to witness Diana run about on the World War II battlefield and take on the Nazis, especially when the scenes were spiced up by those impressive visual effects.<br/><br/>And it should also be said that the camera work and cinematography in ""Wonder Woman"" really helped the movie to stand out as well. Lots of great visual presentation of the various scenes throughout the course of the entire movie.<br/><br/>The cast in the movie was good, and aside from Gal Gadot, then I was more than impressed with the performances put on by Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Saïd Taghmaoui, Ewen Bremner and Elena Anaya. Danny Huston was great in the villainous role of Ludendorff, and Elena Anaya really nailed the role of Dr. Maru. It was a shame that the Dr. Maru character weren't given more on-screen time, because that character had a lot of potential and could have proved so much more effective had the writers opted for more focus on her. However, the casting of Chris Pine was puzzling to me, because he will forever be Associated with a substitute captain Kirk from the ""Star Trek"" reboots.<br/><br/>The characters found in the movie were well-rounded and quite nicely detailed and fleshed out on the screen. There was just about enough character development and growth for all characters to make them all matter and have importance to the storyline. However, some could have benefited more from having more on-screen time, of course.<br/><br/>One thing that failed, aside from the offbeat and misplaced attempts of comedy, was the fact that the German's didn't speak German. That small feat and detail brings so much flavor and believably to the movie. So I was puzzled why they hadn't opted for that kind of authenticity.<br/><br/>There were some misplaced attempts at bringing humor into the movie, which didn't sit well with me, and it stuck out like a sore thumb in comparison to the rest of the movie. For example, with the impressive feats and abilities that the Amazons showed, then why did Diana have such problems with a simple, rotating swing door? It was just a laughable attempt at comedy that should never have been in the final cut of the movie.<br/><br/>I was genuinely entertained by ""Wonder Woman"", and I will say that director Patty Jenkins definitely stepped up to the task and delivered where it mattered and where it counted. Regardless of if you like superhero movies or not, then ""Wonder Woman"" is definitely worth taking the time to sit down and watch."

"kevinxirau","8","4","10","17 June 2017"," Truly a wonder to behold.
","I was starting to have my doubts about the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). ""Man of Steel"" was a nice enough movie that, like Superman, struggled to find its place, ""Batman v Superman"" was a polarizing flick that was too ambitious for its own good, and ""Suicide Squad"" was an entertaining film that lacked cohesion. Then along came ""Wonder Woman"", which I can confidently say restored my faith. For a character that started as an icon of feminism and is a member of the Trinity, it's shocking how long it took for the heroine to grace the big screen (with only a 70s live-action series and a 2009 animated solo film to speak of) without any involvement with the Justice League; personally, I blame DC's over-reliance on Batman and Superman and bad experience with female superhero movies (*cough* Catwoman).<br/><br/>Plot: Diana is the princess of the Amazons who has lived in peace on the hidden island of Themyscira until soldier Steve Trevor crash lands and tells of World War 1. Unwilling to let innocents suffer and suspecting powers greater than man at work, she goes with Steve to fight evil, but as she does she learns what lies beyond her home and what dwells within all of humanity.<br/><br/>From beginning to end I was impressed. The film understands the core of Wonder Woman's character and what she represents, the potential for greatness in all of us in the face of adversity. Gal Gadot nails it, not only being bad-ass, but also bringing much needed depth and charm to her role. I can't help but smile at her innocent and well-meaning view of the world. Chris Pine was perfectly cast as Steve Trevor as well; just seems like a role he was born to play. The two share a very believable chemistry the way they play off each other such as their questions of how their respective worlds work and what do they know about life. The rest of the cast holds up well, offering some nice dynamics and even a humorous moment here and there. In fact, none of the comedy feels forced like in ""Suicide Squad"", feeling more natural especially given the time period. The story has this interesting shift in its tone and color throughout, starting from the beauty and innocence of Themyscira to the dreary ugliness of the outside world to the hopefulness of the future. Diana's journey reflects this as well, developing in the best way possible into the hero she was meant to be. It's clear that the writers and director knew exactly what they were doing and I give them props.<br/><br/>The action scenes are a great spectacle, especially with the now iconic Wonder Woman theme playing in the background adding to the excitement, with lots of good choreography involving a mix of classic fantasy combat and modern warfare. Even better is that they each serve their purpose in the story rather than being there just for the hell of it. There are some surprising twists I didn't see coming, especially when it came to the villains (who are grim reflections of the real world and each entertaining in their own right), and moments that are both heartwarming and heartbreaking.<br/><br/>As of yet, I can't think of anything negative about the film unlike the other ones. As of yet, this is the best DCEU film ever made and it gave me more investment in seeing more to come. Go ahead and see ""Wonder Woman"", but don't expect any after-credit scene."

","So far the best DCEU film, although that is not a difficult task. I really expected the film to fail until the first reviews came in. And while it is not a perfect film, its a very good superhero drama with many great elements. Putting Patty Jenkins on the director chair was a brave and inspired choice and it paid off. She did a fantastic job creating the world around this iconic character. And not only when it comes to story telling Jenkins succeeded, also the action scenes were perfectly choreographed. Another reason why the film works so well is leading actress Gal Gadot who was already the best thing in Batman Vs. Superman and now again convinces with her charismatic performance that has a lot of depth to it. Chris Pine was also decent enough and an ideal choice for that role. I had loved to see more of the amazon mythology especially with Robin Wright's great character but the World War I setting also gave the film a good touch. And they did the implementation better than Marvel did with the first Captain America. The score was great, the cinematography and editing wonderful. I could have done with less slow motion moments but in general this is for DC to go the right direction with."

","The film opens with a hint of a superhero crossover, as a courier from Wayne Enterprises delivers a package to Diana Prince, containing a century old photograph. The photograph sets her off on a reverie of her childhood on the hidden island of Themyscira, which ends when a plane piloted by Steve Trevor crashes through their shield followed soon after by a German gunboat. The Amazons kill the Germans but several Amazons are killed, including their beloved general. Trevor tells them of World War I raging outside. So the first question is, if a stray plane and gunboat can discover them, why weren't they repeatedly discovered by stray ships many times before? In response to his question as to how she speaks English, Diana tells Steve that they speak hundreds of languages. So how can they know hundreds of modern languages and yet be unaware of World War I? Diana decides she must leave to help end the slaughter. They set out in a small boat and when they wake up at dawn, they're in London. How did they get from a presumably Greek island to London in a single night?<br/><br/>The historical nexus is well chosen. A fanatical German general and a mad scientist are plotting to unleash a super gas against the Allies on the eve of the Armistice, to prolong the war and ultimately win it for Germany. Trevor, Diana, and a few of Trevor's seedy friends decide to infiltrate behind German lines and stop the Germans. Diana's astonishment and horror at the effects of modern war are moving and wonderfully acted out, and the scene where she leads a charge across No- Man's Land to rescue a village would be utterly absurd if it weren't so thrilling and inspiring.<br/><br/>Diana believes the plot is master-minded by the god Ares, who rebelled against Zeus in anger over the creation of mankind. In due course they infiltrate the German base, Steve hijacks the German plane full of gas bombs and pilots it to his inevitable heroic death. Diana and Ares have it out. Ares explains to Diana that he merely plants suggestions in people's minds, but that humans cause wars all by themselves. <br/><br/>So Diana and Ares slam into each other, each flinging the other hundreds of yards, landing hard enough to shatter pavement. Didn't Superman and Zod do that in ""Man of Steel?"" They each hurl lightning bolts at each other, so very Palpatine and Darth Vader. The utter unoriginality and physical absurdity of this climactic fight detracts sadly from the film.<br/><br/>So at the end we understand the photograph. It shows her, Steve Trevor and his motley crew just after they liberate the village. She types an e-mail to Bruce Wayne, thanking him. Then we see her on a high perch above modern London, aware that her mission is far more complicated than she ever imagined."

","After the last DC movies I was quite worried though very excited to watch Wonder Woman. I have to say this was not bad at all. The script was not very good and some lead roles' acting was not up to the mark but as a whole the movie was quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot has the perfect look for Wonder Woman. But her dialogue delivery wasn't quite convincing. The weird Amazonian accents didn't add up. But the best cast was definitely Chris Pine as Steve Trevor. He gave a genuine performance. The music was pretty good.<br/><br/>The action was well composed and the heroine stances from Gal was pretty cool to watch. The chemistry between Gal & Chris was solid and funny but sometimes a little exaggerated. But the representation of the main antagonist was one of the weakest points of this movie.<br/><br/>Overall it's a good movie centering a female superhero which gives positive messages."

","Certainly a fun and entertaining movie. I particularly enjoyed the performances of the two leading actors. Some of the script is a bit of an ouch. The way that Princess Diana says ""Excuse Me"" to her mother The Queen being one example early on. There was an over extended sexual undertone that I disliked in two parts of the movie. No bad language that I noticed, but one (unnecessary?) extremely sudden violent assassination of a German Officer shot in the head that had our audience gasping. Yes focus on ""Love"" being good is there, but could probably write an essay on the anti-Christian aspects of this movie. Generally liked the CGI effects but the opening shots from a cliff of an island covered sea looked very unconvincing. A lot of trouble has been taken with WW1 period artifacts, costume and atmosphere. Some incredulity included as one would expect, such as the tiny WW1 bomb dropped by hand is not likely to result in an entire factory exploding instantaneously. Pretty sure there are a few continuity errors to. Is the pilot shown in flashback stealing aircraft without cap/goggles, pushing pilot with items on to the ground, only to crash in the sea with them on? ""Southern Railway (1923) carriage was clearly shown in 1918, yet some nice period props were made, including a Foden Steam Lorry which was destroyed later on in the film. Personally found the very sudden changes in period a bit tough to take. Movie seemed to want to cover enormous scope, but it really was entertaining."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","4","10","9 June 2017"," No matter how you slice it, ""Wonder Woman"" draws its strength from its ladies
","DC Entertainment needed a superhero hit badly, and what better way to make a comeback than with a female heroine? Maybe ""Wonder Woman"" should be evaluated apart from its exciting feminist energy, but in a prolific superhero movie landscape, individuality matters, and the female star-director duo of Gal Gadot and Patty Jenkins is a large part of what makes ""Wonder Woman"" stand out.<br/><br/>Aside from the very obvious, however, nothing groundbreaking is at play here in this movie in terms of its genre and storytelling. Even its wartime period setting (""Captain America: The First Avenger"") and mix of mythology and the real world (""Thor"") have been done before. Diana (Gadot) exhibits similar traits to the optimism and principled nature of Captain America and the joie de vivre and brazenness of Thor. So if ""Wonder Woman"" feels fresh at all, you have to strongly consider the impact of the feminine factor.<br/><br/>What's great about Diana in this film is that she doesn't fit in a box and she can't be told what to do. Gadot exhibits a subtle but definitive confidence with the ability to step back for lighter moments and forward when we need to connect with the ferocity of her feelings and beliefs. Screenwrtier Allan Heinberg, whose credits include a number of female-driven TV shows, does his best work giving Gadot opportunities to display Diana's personality, and the way her sex factors into this World War I setting is forthright but not overbearing.<br/><br/>The script's only other strength is in delivering a message about war and love and humanity's capacity for good and evil. Superhero films and similar genres have treaded in this territory plenty of times, but Diana's journey to her epiphany is well-realized. The rest of the story, however, leans too much on formula and cliché. <br/><br/>In fact, aside from Robin Wright and a solid enough beach battle, ""Wonder Woman"" is a pretty terrible movie until Diana leaves her home on the island of Themyscira. She's just another rebellious hero with a destiny who wants to defy a parent and leave her home. Some of the film's distractingly poor CGI shots (like young Diana jumping off a cliff) don't help. It also takes about halfway through the movie to adjust and accept Jenkins' reliance on slow-motion and computer- driven action shots and appreciate the heavy stylization. <br/><br/>Once Diana sets sail with Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), a spy for the British who washed up on her island and told her of the ""war to end all wars"" that she feels destined to end, ""Wonder Woman"" begins a gradual but sure-footed ascent toward quality. The initial boat scene, in which she turns Trevor into a bumbling fool with her confidence and poise, hints at the character development to come.<br/><br/>The prevailing tone and sentiment of ""Wonder Woman"" very closely echoes that first ""Captain America"" movie, which was extremely solid, so even though it doesn't transcend it, it's a fair and positive comparison, better even for those who haven't seen that movie. Both heroes discover the positive impact that one gifted individual can have on the world (with the right team), which in ""Wonder Woman"" comes in the form of a pretty unforgettable sequence between the trenches of the Western front.<br/><br/>Like many of the ensuing scenes, this ""No Man's Land"" sequence isn't mind-blowing, but everything that does happen from this point on is particularly attuned to Diana. Everything caters to her emotional journey and the place her worldview is meant to arrive, even if it isn't especially gripping, compelling or surprising.<br/><br/>There's no better way to describe how Jenkins captures her star and main character other than inspiring. Although not immediately evident to this cisgender male reviewer, you can see the effect the film is having on women and girls and understand it. <br/><br/>Although Gadot's hair is blowing about a lot and we get Diana in slow motion action poses, Jenkins – whether because she's a woman herself or understands the sensitivities having a woman action star requires – avoids over-sexualizing Gadot. The sexiness of Diana comes from her strength and confidence more than Gadot's physical attractiveness. The slow motion is about letting that sink in and inspire, not about ogling her. By the end, Diana's strength, intelligence and sexiness is only matched by her mindfulness and compassion, which we haven't seen to the same degree in Wonder Woman's male counterparts.<br/><br/>I don't want to make ""Wonder Woman"" into a movie that's only about its hero's gender, but having seen enough superhero movies, so much of what sets ""Wonder Woman"" apart is the result of its female star and female director. After so many male-dominated superhero films, that perspective really makes a difference in carving out a space for ""Wonder Woman"" among its contemporaries.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"stoopsjosh","8","4","10","9 June 2017"," Great action movie from the DCEU
","Watched this opening weekend and really enjoyed it. Just now getting to write this review so I'll Star it off with this: I'm so tired of the ""Marvel vs DC"" debate. I understand they're both comic book movies and should be compared, but at the same time they're different in tone, characters, and overall style. A good movie is a good movie whether it be a Marvel movie or a DC movie. That being said, this is a fantastic action flick. A couple spoilers below.<br/><br/>The slow-mo shots were a bit over the top. I enjoy tasteful slow motion and sometimes that means I don't even want to notice the slow motion. Slow motion started as a cinematic element to make the audience focus on something. When a woman is beating the crap out of a bunch of men, it's cool... in fact, it's really cool... but there's some parts where they slowed down every punch and kick (not actually but that's what it felt like). Not saying they should've taken all the slow motion out... some of the shots were sick. Others were redundant and just took me out of the mood to enjoy the sequence. I feel like the movie could've been almost 20 minutes shorter if the filmmakers used the slow-mo sparingly. <br/><br/>I loved the character development. For once the DCEU actually makes me feel like the characters aren't doing things for their own selfish desires. Everything felt genuine. From the part where little Diana is running away from school, to the beach battle, to the fight scenes. For every action there was a reaction, whether that be from another character or the scene around them. Everything is explained really well, and the humor was tasteful, ALTHOUGH, I thought the scene in the boat and dialogue about ""pleasure"" was a bit too far. <br/><br/>The final act (boss) felt like a video game cut scene to me. Didn't hate it though. I thought it was epic, but I felt it was missing something and I don't know what that was. Maybe it was the fact they were surrounded by fire and made it seem like the VFX editors got lazy. I understand that there were explosions and what not, but Diana was literally getting thrown hundreds of yards at some points, and yet, still surrounded by fire... yet she never landed in it? I also thought it was stupid of ""Aries"" to fight her with lightning... okay... the first time she absorbed it so try it again but twice as strong. Where's the logic in that? They literally reveal that she's the daughter of Zeus.... THE SKY GOD THAT CONTROLS LIGHTNING!!! That's like fighting a water type Pokémon with water. When your enemy literally absorbs your attack I think it's time to try something different. Especially from Aries being the God of War; you would think he'd have a better tactic. But like I said, it was a really cool battle scene those were just a couple things that bugged me. <br/><br/>One last thing. At the end when Steve (Chris Pine) hands her the watch and we can't hear anything he says because we're allegedly hearing through Diana's ears I thought that was neat. What I didn't think was neat was when 5 minutes later there's a flashback to that scene and we can now hear what he said... really? Why couldn't we save the time and just hear it the first time? It could've saved a couple minutes. <br/><br/>Overall, it was a really good action/comic movie from the DCEU. It had all the elements m, and even a surprise twist for those of us who didn't read the comics (if the twist even happened in the comics), which were well sculpted wonderfully by director Patty Jenkins. This is definitely one that I'll consider buying when it's out on Blu Ray. <br/><br/>8/10"
"eagandersongil","7","4","10","9 June 2017"," The back over DC
","The best movie of the new era of DC superheroes in the movies, we can safely say that with a timeline completely confused in its chronology, the DC universe finally began to make sense in theaters. Wonder woman is not a perfect movie, it's far from that, but it's a sigh of hope. Telling a story of origin, the film is a great flashback, and make it clear in the first scene, the script of the film is good, especially in the construction of the character and creation of the myth, but in the unfolding of history itself is diffuse. WONDERFUL, GOOD, PASSIVE, these are the 3 adjectives that we can use to describe each act of the film, with a very well built beginning, we have the presentation of the hero and the call to adventure, even if it follows a structure already known, the film is Great, with great scenes and a creation of the world, the Amazons are incredible, and the whole representation of their mythology also, in the second moment we have the acceptance of the adventure, the movie falls, but still good, passing in the first war more with taste Of cold war, we have fights veiled, great dialogues, a great team building, and even the great help of the wonder woman in the reconquest of a village (great sequence), the problems begin in the third act, where the film calls for a villain , Which appears out of nowhere (although the movie is all foreseeable), super forced and that badly helps in the character's progression, maybe if the film did not have a super powerful villain, just an analogy of the war in r To Ares, would be much more interesting, even because the wonder woman was not yet a ready heroine, but insist on putting the hero in the test of fire, do what né .... the end is disconnected with everything that until then came Being presented. The film seems to have been directed by zack Snyder (who despite the critics, I really like a lot of his filmography), we have his cameras used excessively in the slow motion mode, we have his photograph characteristically gray, the scenes of battles that seems to have His signature and even the clear evidence and affirmation that the hero is the hero, in spite of all this evidence, we know that the film was directed by the experienced in television but new in cinema patty jenkins, that sends well, and to notice that the fall Circumstantial in the film is more the script's fault than its direction. We can not fail to praise Gal Gado, who, although not having the best of dramatic charges, behaves well in all scenes of the film, especially in action. ""Wonder Woman"" is not a good thing, but it is a confirmation of what we already knew, DC knows how to make a hero movie!"
"mcmugged","9","4","10","9 June 2017"," Great stand-alone movie from the DC super hero brand
","I hope that the producers of this movie realize that what made it so good was most of the movie told a good stand-alone story--how Wonder Woman came to be and how she discovers her path in the world outside of her Amazon island. <br/><br/>Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were really good together. They both have charisma and chemistry.<br/><br/>There was plenty of action just in the war scenes from WWl. At the end, it got loud with Wonder Woman battling Ares (an evil God).<br/><br/>I am glad that they didn't overdo the destruction scenes. The theater I watched this at had the sound on very loud and it was deafening. If there had been a lot of these scenes, I would not have liked the movie at all. In fact, I probably will not go see Justice League because there are too many super heroes which means there will be too many super villains. I grew up reading Superman and other DC comics back in the 60s. Today's super heroes are not as exciting. But Wonder Woman has brought back the kind of super hero I used to love."
"rogerdarlington","Null","4","10","6 June 2017"," Refreshingly different and successfully entertaining
","This is a refreshingly different super-hero movie: one with a female central character (Diana Prince - the name Wonder Woman is never used in the film - played by the tall and beautiful Israeli martial artist, model and actress Gal Gadot) and a female director (Patty Jenkins who previously gave us ""Monster"", another work with a central female personage) with a significant number of female support roles (Amazonian heroines, a chemist villainess, and a comedic aide). <br/><br/>Of course, we've seen WW before in ""Batman vs Superman: Dawn Of Justice"" and we'll see her again soon in the forthcoming ""Justice League"". What works so well with this movie is that it is an origin story that stands alone and does not require the audience to have any familiarity with other super-heroes which enables it to reach out to a new (especially female) audience.<br/><br/>The narrative is straightforward, starting on the well-realised Amazonian island of Themyscira and then moving, via 1918 London, onto a blood-splattered battlefield at the conclusion of the First World War. There are effective action sequences but also some nice humorous touches in a work that does not take itself too seriously and delivers handsomely on the entertainment front. Chris Pine is ideal as the good-looking American who leads Diana from one world to the other and introduces her to the best and the worst of humankind, while David Thewlis is interesting casting for a vital dual role. <br/><br/>The flaws in the film include the easy defeat of the main villain (after all, he is a god) and an excessive running time and some feminists will criticise the portrayal of the titular heroine, but overall the work is a major success that deservedly will do well at the box office."
"vikyaiyer","9","4","10","6 June 2017"," Hmm, read the whole damn thing...
","Gal Gadot does play a Fierce woman character, awesome side-character(Chris Pine as Steve Trevor), little comedic, awesome soundtrack, good CGI, fascinating stunts(some of them seemed repetitive), good old plot twists but still Dark Knight is the gem for DC not this one not even close as it seriously lacked character development for villain.<br/><br/>Another serious problem with DC in this movie is the adaption of Greek mythology for this story. They expect the global audience to know the backstory of these Greek gods and feel the power and importance of them but that surely doesn't seem to be working.The exponential growth in power at the end seemed illogical.<br/><br/>But one major thing established before DC venturing into justice league is that wonder woman is way more powerful and has the capacity to do anything. This is major achievement by DC as Marvel has continuously failed to portray powerful woman character in big screens.<br/><br/>It's one time watch and I wouldn't be waiting for it's blue-ray disk release to watch it again."
"alfCycle","7","4","10","5 June 2017"," Very entertaining, well made superhero epic
","I was not looking forward to this movie at all. The first three DC Extended Universe films were all poor entries into the superhero genre. I can't say that I enjoyed any of them. Batman V Superman was OK, I guess. It had some good things mixed with a lot of crap. One of the positives being Wonder Woman. I thought Man of Steel and Suicide Squad were both pretty crappy. Based on this track record, I was not in a rush to see Wonder Woman and kind of forgot it was even coming out. Then I saw some online buzz from some sources I trust indicating that this film was actually really good. So I decided to go see it and I'm glad I did. This was a very entertaining, well made superhero epic. I felt the pacing of the movie was great, taking time to develop the characters and the world they inhabit. Most of the action sequences were very well done. Also, the film does a great job of incorporating humor without feeling forced. I think this movie was pretty successful at making me buy into the mythology, which could have come across as too silly, even for a superhero movie. My least favorite of the Marvel films are the Thor standalones, mostly for that reason. The only real negatives I had were with the less than compelling villains and the big CGI fight sequence at the end. I've kind of grown tired of the big laser, lightning, fireball exploding green screen fight sequences in these movies. I enjoyed the more, literally, grounded, well choreographed hand to hand, sword, arrow, gun battles that came earlier in the movie. Overall, if you like fun fantasy adventure films, you'll probably enjoy this movie quite a bit.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>************SPOILERS************<br/><br/>Recommended for those that enjoy strong kickass female characters, Xena Warrior Princess Island, Captain James T.

","Probably the best DC movie since The Dark Knight. The action sequences were phenomenal. The slow motion affects in the fights added to awesomeness.

It was a small dip but past that first hour, it was non stop action. The chemistry between Chris Pine and Gal Gadot was great. This movie is definitely a must see. Maybe it's even worthy of owning on Blu-Ray."
"ayoreinf","8","4","10","4 June 2017"," Best delivery of superficial slogans ever, with the right amount of pathos
","It's a good film, firstly because it has an abundance of humanity and human feeling to it. It's something often forgotten in the DC comics, because unlike marvel, it centers on the heroic part. That's the reason, DC characters, are so much better in TV series than they are in their drawn version or in their cinematic version. In the extended TV versions, there's no choice but to develop the personal life - the human part of the super heroes. Yes I know it's an over simplified generalization, but as a rule that's the main difference between Marvel's superheroes, and the DC ones, except Batman, where the line between the hero and the human is all but nonexistent. And that's why Batman movies did work better than any other DC movies we know about. Yes, there's another short lived exception to this rule that is the first two movies of Christopher Reeve's Superman, where they managed to counter the pomposity with the right amount of campiness. It was a very fine balance, and a very hard one to maintain. It took some very fine acting and a very careful script, and they half lost it by the 3rd one, not to mention the 4th.<br/><br/>So here we have a first human DC superhero, in a long while. And it's a combined effort. Gal Gadot is mostly great, but she's still a rookie, and does have two or three off moments, during the film, so here comes the director and the editing, not to mention the other stellar cast, they all cover for her, making sure the movie stays true. Making sure that all the melodrama, is balanced, some jokes at the right moment also help, but the truth is that the humor is very limited. Compare it with most of Marvel's productions and you'll see I'm right. It's simply more humorous than recent DC movies, but that's easy. It's once again a fine balance kept by a combined effort of the entire production.<br/><br/>And here I return to my title. Why do I say Gal Gadot is great despite her few off moments during the film. Because she delivers the most superficial pompous slogans with such conviction, you don't really feel how banal they were, until you rethink the whole thing. Not many veterans of the trade can get away with it, she does. All she still has to do is polish her act a bit more and she'll be one of the best"
"The-Sarkologist","7","4","10","4 June 2017"," The Goddess of the Geeks
","My first question when I saw the trailer to this film was not only how old Wonder Woman was, but why was it that she doesn't seem to age. You see this film is set during World War 1, and could be considered the Wonder Woman origin story. However, Batman vs Superman was set in the modern era and sure enough Wonder Woman hadn't aged. Well, as it turns out Wonder Woman is not quite human, and for those who are familiar with the comics, you will know that she was created out of clay and given life by Zues – that's right, Wonder Woman is actually the Roman Goddess Diana (hence her name), for more specifically Artmenis (though for some reason they default to her Roman identity as opposed to the original Greek, which sort of runs counter to the background).<br/><br/>The movie begins on the Island of the Amazons and Diana growing up. However one day a plane crashes, and following that plane is a German Dreadnaught. Diana is thus drawn into the horrors of World War 1. Actually, the back story is that the god of war, Ares, had been defeated by Zeus, but has been simmering for centuries waiting for a time to destroy humanity. Well, that time arrived during World War 1, and when Diana hears that the war to end all wars is being waged beyond the shores of her island, it is time for her to leave and take her place in the world of men.<br/><br/>There are a few interesting things in this film, one of them being the nature of the character. I realised as I was watching this film that Wonder Woman takes the form of that perfect girl that all comic book geeks would love – not only is she incredibly attractive, but she is incredibly strong as well. The thing is that she takes the masculine side that many geeks lack, but also has a very strong feminine side as well. In a way she would be seen by many as that perfect girl, one who is strong, but who is beautiful as well. However, the thing that attracts me is that she is apparently the goddess Artemis.<br/><br/>This is an interesting thing because the Greeks were a very male dominated society - the women basically were not allowed out of the house, and had absolutely no rights whatsoever. Yet we have these gods, such as Artemis and Athena, who personify both wisdom, strength, and beauty. However, they also stand out in a way that they are not married, and it is clear that they never will marry. There is actually a story where a hunter, Acteaon, stumbled upon Artemis while she was taking a bath, and Acteaon left that encounter much worse for wear – he was turned into a stag and Artemis' hounds chased him down and killed him.<br/><br/>Thus putting her into a World War 1 setting is fitting because this is basically a story of a woman in a man's world. In a way she must not only prove herself, but she must also stand and fight against the male prejudice that dominated at the time – that is women don't go to war. However, this was also the beginning of the feminist movement as while the men were at war, the women were all doing the men's work. There is a love story here as well, and a rather tragic one at that, however I won't go any further because that will probably ruin what turned out to be a really good movie."

","Just got in from ""Wonder Woman"". some random thoughts...<br/><br/>I liked it, but I didn't love it. I thought it was pretty good, but I didn't think it was great. It didn't ""Wow"" me...I would however,recommend it and give it a thumbs up...I know some will disagree with me.<br/><br/>I think the two best things about the film were: 1 - Gal Gadot nailed it as Wonder Woman. Fine acting, fine look and fine physicality (When it's not a CGI Wonder Woman leaping around). She was clearly the best thing in that Superman/Batman train wreck movie and pretty much carries this movie and franchise squarely on her shoulders. 2 - All of the scenes featuring Diana's naive and humorous interactions with the civilized world. Welcome light moments in the very dark DC movie universe.<br/><br/>I also like the vibe that they really tried to make a good Wonder Woman movie and not hack out the same old usual dreck (And succeeded most of the time).<br/><br/>What I didn't like... - I liked the parts better than the sum of the whole (The same way I feel about movies like ""Remo Williams"")...I just really didn't care much about the Ares super villain story line, I was more interested in her dealing with the horrors of WWI. That was a more interesting movie to me. The whole Ares thing just seemed ""standard"" and lackluster and the only thing missing was some magic orb!. - While I liked some of the action, I felt that the bad camera work and uber hyper editing during the action scenes, deterred from some solid choreography. When are these people going to learn how to shoot and edit action, so that people can see, comprehend and enjoy it, instead of being visually assaulted!<br/><br/>Overall, I liked it, I liked Gadot, it will make many quatloos and the franchise will move forward.. I'm just glad it wasn't a Marvel movie, otherwise Stan Lee would have shown up somewhere as a German soldier or a baggage handler."

","DC did good with this one. Great Origins story of wonder woman and an enjoyable experience overall. I am pleasantly surprised by Gal Gadot's performance and her ability to carry this film. Any doubts about Gal's ability to portray wonder woman in all her glory will be put to rest. She and other cast member do a good job of doing justice to their roles but that standout was Chris Pine who steals the show, for me. The action scene are nice, and remind me a bit of Justice league visual style. the CGI is good but can be improved in some places, especially during Gal Gadot's fighting scene. The story is entertaining and the mild humour offer moments of relaxation. Overall, this film is an enjoyable film that does justice to the greatest female superhero of all time. Good job DC. Let hope the trend continues."
"oldchummer","7","7","22","2 June 2017"," There's already a low bar set for Female superhero movies
","Seeing as how the last two female led superhero movies were Electra and Catwoman, the quality of female superhero movies have mostly been quite poor. While I wouldn't say this is a bad movie, its perfectly average at best. <br/><br/>Gal Gadot is fine in the movie, she did have a little more charisma than most of her past performances, which have been very flat. This was refreshing, because going into the movie I didn't have very high expectations for her acting, but she did a decent job. As a lot of reviews have pointed out, Wonder Woman as a character lacks cynicism and has a very black and white view of the world. The scenes where Wonder Woman adapting to the real world are sort of like Thor, and the humor being that she's very out of place in this world. However, the humor parts were very one note in that way, as that was the center focus for the majority of comedic moments in the movie, and it got a little old. The actions scenes are fun while its on screen, as its fun seeing the lasso being used and Wonder Woman being able to punch through brick walls, but again as with most superhero and action movies it becomes really explosion heavy and mostly predictable in the last 30 minutes or so.<br/><br/>I'd say the biggest negatives in the movie are the character's that aren't Wonder Woman or Steve Trevor. The majority of them have one defining character trait, and that seems to be especially present in the soldier characters that team up with the Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor. There's the pervy one, the drunk guy that likes to fight, and an Indian guy (don't really remember what he did in the movie). Then for the villains, there's Aries who wants to *gasp* destroy mankind, an evil German general, and an evil German scientist. All three of the villains were like cardboard cutouts, zero depth. Other character's such as Steve's secretary (a slightly annoying character), and some British military officers were all very one note as well. <br/><br/>Other slight issues I had, were that it didn't seem like there was a whole lot to the Amazons other than being warriors, it seems like if there's a world with only women that fighting wouldn't necessarily be the main focus they would have."

"NormanCroucher","5","5","14","22 October 2017"," Unexceptional superhero adventure elevated due to its gender politics
","A mainstream blockbuster fronted by a female superhero has long been overdue. You can count on one hand the amount of women-led comic book movies, so this was both an important and necessary project to see come to life. And it arrives at a politically and culturally divisive time, which I suspect played a large part in its thunderous praise and success, because this is totally unremarkable superhero fare. Pedestrian at best, risible at worst.<br/><br/>The problems begin with Gal Gadot in the title role. She certainly looks the part and is at her best when playing up the fish-out-of- water comedy (which is surprisingly prevalent throughout) but she comes off as wooden and stilted in the more dramatic scenes and makes for a super bland super-protagonist. Her uneven, clumsy performance is occasionally salvaged by the eclectic supporting cast around her, from Robin Wright's steely warrior mentor (who would have been a great Wonder Woman herself in the 1990s) to Chris Pine's love interest (who essentially just replicates the charming rogue he plays in everything).<br/><br/>As the late Roger Ebert once said, a film is only ever as good as its villains, and by that measure 'Wonder Woman' falls well short. Danny Huston has absolutely nothing to do as a generic evil German General who makes the Nazis in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' look three dimensional, while David Thewlis as the surprise villain at the end feels like a personality-free version of Tom Hiddleston's Loki character from the 'Thor' movies, which is fitting considering 'Wonder Woman' is a mishmash of the plot elements from Marvel's first installments of 'Thor' and 'Captain America'.<br/><br/>Director Patty Jenkins achieves the right visual aesthetic for the material, presenting vibrant colours for the fantasy realms of Wonder Woman's Amazonian home, and washed-out muted blues and greys for the grit and grime of the real world at war. Some of the imagery she architects looks as beautiful as a Renaissance-era work of art, but her absolute insistence on over-stylizing her generic action sequences soon wears thin. Whenever someone jumps, flips or runs, we instantly slide into slow motion to emphasize EVERY. SINGLE. MOVEMENT. and it often breaks the momentum of the action itself. It's almost like Jenkins didn't realise that the bullet-time effects from 'The Matrix' are no longer fashionable to imitate. In the years to come, the action set-pieces and shockingly ropy CGI effects will be the first thing to date.<br/><br/>With that said, 'Wonder Woman' has a good heart, much like its main character, and it is impossible to dislike entirely. Jenkins ensures that the story never takes itself too seriously, peppering the voyage with plenty of jokes and culture clash gags along the way, and while the plot is ripped straight from the pages of the superhero origin story playbook and plods along with no real sense of propulsion, it surpasses the turgid misfires of its DC universe siblings 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'.<br/><br/>If nothing else, 'Wonder Woman' has proved one thing for sure; women can be just as capable and competent at making generic and uninspired blockbuster balderdash as the men."

","My trust to IMDb's credibility has just expired. At least to its rating part.

And that is a very bad syndrome, when a trash like this scores something in vicinity of Forman, Scorsese or Coppola at their best.

","Zack Snyder strikes again. He wrote the script. It shows!<br/><br/>No character development - this is an origin story. I wanted to see how Diana becomes Wonder woman, what experiences shape her on her journey, is she ever at conflict with her values? There is no single incident that actually affects or moulds her in anyway. Diana is essentially WW at the beginning of the movie. She does not grow into or earn this role. Nothing shapes or impacts her after she is WW either. She falls in love but would she have been a different WW otherwise? NO! <br/><br/>In Iron Man, it took 2/3 of the movie, failures and multiple iterations, for Tony Stark to become Iron Man. His experience in the cave and learning that his weapons are used by terrorists, deeply impact and change him. Spider-man has to live with the guilt of his uncle's death, learn to use his powers, understand the balance of power and responsibility. Thor is born with all the power but it takes a whole movie for him to learn what it means to be a hero. Captain America has to become a leader and earn everyone's respect. Batman, Doctor Strange... there are so many examples of origin stories. The self discovery and growth are not implied, they are core and intrinsic to the story. WW does not have this core - she has an objective which is entirely different. For this reason alone, this movie is an epic fail in my book.<br/><br/>Themyscira: I just hated this in its entirety <br/><br/><ul><li>Weird accent. Gal Gadot couldn't fake an American accent, so they had everyone else try to talk like her. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Young Diana. The primary purpose is to elicit a 'cho chweet' response. She is a demi-god. There is no self discovery... why is she different, stronger than everyone else; how does that affect her? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The 'train her, don't train her' non-issue. Diana gets combat trained despite her mother (and Queen!) not consenting. The arising conflict should have taken more than 2 lines of dialogue to be resolved. This would have also impacted Diana, her mother didn't want her to learn combat and suddenly wants her to be the best. Why? This is a page right out of Zack Snyder's Martha handbook of resolving issues.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Fighting. The creative decision was that Amazonians don't fight, they ballet. Every jump, swing from a rope, shooting an arrow, getting off a horse is a dance move. It just looked ridiculous.</li></ul><br/><br/>Strike a pose: WW literally poses in each and every shot. She has her shoulders pushed back like she is trying to make her shoulder blades meet. It looks unnatural and odd. The poses are the exact same as in BvS. There is...wrists crossed in front of the face, crouching behind the shield, standing in a wide stance and the jumping pose with one knee bent. And they are shot exactly the same as in BvS. They probably just reused clips. They are not poses in the middle of a range of movements. It's pose, pause for 5 secs, next pose, pause for 5, repeat.<br/><br/>Humour: This is not comic relief. They dedicated a continuous 15-20 min segment and it all stems from the cultural differences between the Amazonians and us. The bath scene, sleeping in the boat, the secretary, the clothes trials... all stems from the same issue. It's the same material stretched for 15 mins and frankly gets tiresome.<br/><br/>Villain: In a weak attempt to create twist, the villain is introduced late in the film. There is no time to associate with the character. The villain exists simply as someone to be fought.<br/><br/>Final battle: Visually, this sequence is identical to the doomsday fight in BvS. If someone mashes these 2 scenes up, it will be hard to differentiate one from the other.<br/><br/>The McGuffin: There is no reason given why WW goes into hiding. What is the entire deal with the photograph and the secrecy? There's so much focus on this but it's not resolved.<br/><br/>Gol Gadot: O!M!G! Could there possibly be a better WW? But she's posing and grunting though the entire movie. Very off putting. Her acting skills fluctuate quite a bit too. Perhaps since her character also fluctuates. WW goes from being head strong, doing what SHE wants, to naive and easily persuaded, to emotionally distraught by the horrors of war, to a super hero that's reckless. BTW since she has no clue of the real world, how does she know if she's fighting on the right side? Also considering Amazonians are warriors, for whom battle training is the only form of recreation, why is she horrified by war?<br/><br/>Fight Choreography: Other than the training sequence, the choreography is a close second if not at par with the fights in Captain America 2 but the slow motion ruins it completely. It's not used to accentuate the fight, every punch goes in to slo-mo. If! everything! is! accentuated! nothing! stands! out! This coupled with the grunting just spoils each fight.<br/><br/>Chris Pine: The best thing in the movie by a mile. His is the only character given some depth and Chris Pine did justice to the role.<br/><br/>I understand the cultural, social and contemporary significance of this movie. But that is not reason enough for me to love it. I feel it completely failed to live up to the hype, even though reviews and box office prove contrary. But there may be a silver lining here. All the hype shows the love for WW and how long overdue the movie really is. I'm hoping they are going to make another one soon and I hope it's going to be far better. Isn't that what a superhero movie is about...hope?"

","A high score for this film is an affront to common sense, to good taste and to IMDb users. I rarely had the chance to see such a (really) bad movie. I felt dismayed, even though I understood the logic that led to this grotesque result: 1) With more and more countries as a target audience, scripts now need to worry, even more, about not displeasing anyone - Chinese, Russians, Brazilians, Germans or Indians - which makes large productions increasingly ""lukewarm"" and tasteless; 2) Being created already thinking of innumerable sequences - which, however, need to be able to be assisted independently, because the studios do not pretend to sell part 2 only for those who watched the first part, nor part 5 only for those who already watched the Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4) - the films can not be either original or even realistic or deep (which would generate issues and complications that would not allow to watch part 6 without having previously seen part 3, for example).<br/><br/>But, by itself, none of this explains the sad experience of watching Wonder Woman. I already went to the cinema aware of this limitations, but was waiting for at least some quality. I am easy to please, with a well thought out script (I knew it would not be the case), with original or well-executed visual effects (not even that are in this movie!), good performances, or even a good soundtrack. Unfortunately Wonder Woman does not deliver any of this.<br/><br/>Is a complete waste of time and money.<br/><br/>And, being clear, it is not feminist at all."

Gal Gadot is a perfect choice for the role of Wonder Woman. Her looks, athleticism and the somewhat exotic accent fit well into this franchise. Better still, the story line, whilst a bit contrived, works well enough to make this a mostly enjoyable, action packed romp. <br/><br/>Perhaps the only downside being, what I felt, was a somewhat subdued and uninteresting performance by Chris Pine. I don't mind Pine but somehow I felt he was more fizzle than burn this outing.

"milk-carton-reviews","7","5","14","29 June 2017"," the best entry in the DCEU cinematic universe so far
","While not a perfect movie, ""Wonder Woman"" is definitely good and by far the best movie of the DCEU. After the likes of ""Batman v Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"", my bar was set pretty low for this movie, and I'm glad to say that it exceeded my expectations. <br/><br/>The beginning starts off a bit weak and exposition-heavy, which was slightly off-putting but still enjoyable enough. However, the second that Steve (Chris Pine) and Diana leave her island, the movie takes a turn for the better. It was refreshing to see that the two love interests in a superhero movie actually had chemistry for a change, and watching them interacting and learning things from each other was just a delight. Without a doubt, the middle was the strongest part of the movie, and the most enjoyable aspect was Diana and Steve's relationship, partly because of the script, but mostly because of the performances by Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. Speaking of Chris Pine, his character actually serves a purpose in the movie and works perfectly next to Diana. Both characters learn from the relationship and grow as people, Diana learning about the realism of the world from Steve, and Steve learning something from Diana's childish optimism, and that there is always something to believe in. Gal Gadot was a delight in the role of Wonder Woman. I was slightly worried while watching ""Batman v Superman"" because I thought she would play a bland and boring version of the character, but this movie just shoved that fear aside. Her line delivery at times could have been better, but it was the emotional lines that counted, and boy, does she know how to deliver a blow. Aside from that, the movie also raises a few interesting points about war and the goodness of men. It forces you to see war from the perspective of someone who never witnessed anything like that before, and who is genuinely baffled by this war and why anybody would choose to start something like it. All of this is brought up in some very powerful scenes, and the goodness of Diana can actually move you, separating her from some other ""purely good"" characters we've seen before, such as Superman and Captain America. <br/><br/>Now on to the negatives. Most of the problems with this movie come with the villains and the obvious meddling of the studio. Let's talk about the villains first. There's two major villains in the real world - Dr Poison and a German general (I believe), but there's also obviously Ares, whom Diana is set on finding because she believes it will end the war if she kills him. The two ""real world"" villains were pretty generic and over the top, with unclear motivations and just completely forgettable. Without spoiling anything, ""Ares"" is not much better. There was a clear point in the movie where I thought ""Okay, this is beautiful, I hope they stop right here and end on a quiet, but enlightening note"", but they just HAD to shove in a major, over-blown CGI battle at the end, which I thought was completely unnecessary. It completely ruined the point that the movie was trying to raise, and if the ending was different, I would have given this movie a higher rating. Also, a minor thing that sort of bugged me (I know it bothered some people more, it was just a minor thing for me, though), is the excessive use of slow motion. I'm not really a fan of Zack Snyder, and as we all know, he really does go overboard with the slow motion. And yes, I know that the movie was directed by Patty Jenkins, and not Zack Snyder, but he was involved with the film and clearly had a role in it. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie was definitely better than what I had expected, I'm just slightly disappointed that it went the traditional superhero route by the end when it could have been so much more, but otherwise, I think it's a great, fun movie that DC fans are going to love."

","First, I want to say that I never expect to be blown away by superhero movies. They all utilize the same formula that produces the same result every single time. However, I enjoy seeing the characters. Thus, I usually walk away from the movies feeling pretty content.<br/><br/>I don't know why, but I got my hopes up for this movie. I've been waiting for it since Gal Gadot was cast in title role. That was my mistake.<br/><br/>The movie begins well enough with the audience getting a taste of life on Themyscira for the first half hour. After that, it took a nose dive. It felt as though Diana's story was put on the back burner to allow for telling the audience about WWI. It reminded me of the first Captain America movie, and I'm glad I'm not the only one who got that vibe.<br/><br/>At the hour mark, I began to constantly check the time, wondering when the movie would end. I did enjoy watching Diana tear through the Germans on the battlefield. However, that felt like one of the few occasions where I actually got to see Wonder Woman, not simply Diana Prince. <br/><br/>The plot twist at the end was perhaps the most unnerving aspect of this movie to me. Since when is Wonder Woman a god? Sure, I'm no expert, but I've read some comics and watched shows and movies. In every incarnation, she's the princess of the Amazons, not some goddess. Of course, I learned later that Zack Snyder wrote the story, so perhaps that's why this made so little sense. <br/><br/>The acting was fine. I always enjoy Chris Pine and I've been enamored with Gal Gadot since Fast and Furious. I truly wish that we'd seen more of Etta Candy; she was pretty funny. I especially enjoyed the repartee between Gadot and Said Taghmaoui.<br/><br/>I can't say that I always enjoyed the lighting. It was way too dark. I felt like I was watching a Batman movie. The CGI wasn't the best, but it wasn't awful. Some of the fight scenes look pretty fake. I wish studios would try to rely more on actors than CGI, but we can't always get we want. I know you'll have some CGI for a superhero movie, but it doesn't need to go overboard.<br/><br/>If I'm being honest, I can't see why this movie's getting such great reviews. It's not a bad movie, but it could've been a lot better. It seems as though the thing nowadays is to laud every movie as exceptional, but then that takes away from those that are truly deserving of such an epithet. <br/><br/>At this rate, I don't have much hope for the upcoming DCEU movies."
"elale-573-971300","10","5","14","15 June 2017"," outstanding!
","Fighting:<br/><br/>This movie has some really excellent fighting. Even the training scenes are great. It was really cool to see the Amazons training and fighting, and I liked that some of them are real fighters. I liked the horse tricks, too, which reminded me of the Cossack riders of the Moscow Circus. The Amazon costumes look good while still being practical to fight in. <br/><br/>The horrors of WWI trench warfare are shown, including the big guns, the gas, and the wounded coming back from the front. Diana has been trying to reach the front to achieve her goal, but she doesn't stay hung ho when Chief tells her the sound she thought was thunder was the sound of the war.<br/><br/>There's a moment in the trench scene when Trevor tells her, ""This is No Man's Land. That means no man can cross it."" I was sure she was about to say ""I am No Man."" But she didn't say it-- she did it. <br/><br/>I liked that the group's sniper doesn't actually snipe. It's realistic that soldiers sometimes don't actually shoot their weapons in battle. Of course that provided an excuse for Wonder Woman to save the day, but that could have been achieved without that touch of realism. <br/><br/>Humor<br/><br/>The script didn't go overboard with the humor, but there was enough there to relieve tension in what was otherwise more of a war movie than a superhero film audience might expect. Yes, there is a penis joke, but hey, Shakespeare did penis jokes, too, right? I liked that the sword-in-the-dress scene, which I knew about from Facebook friends sharing ""got your back"" pics, turned out to be a moment of humor instead of a serious fight scene, because the actual fight scene that happened later was way better than it would have been in a room full of noncombatants. <br/><br/>Stranger in a Strange Land<br/><br/>This movie did the fish-out-of-water thing way better than the first Thor movie did. In part that was because Diana didn't know things, like whether men slept, that were really basic things about our world but which she genuinely had a good story reason not to know. There was the inevitable ""getting local clothes"" scene, but it wasn't overplayed. <br/><br/>The villain<br/><br/>At first, when the backstory of Ares was explained by the Amazons, it seemed like Ares was going to be the sort of evil villain that does evil just for the sake of evil. Of course a superhero story needs a supervillain, and given that Diana is the daughter of Zeus (which I already knew before they made this movie, but which Diana herself doesn't know until late in the movie) of course no mere human villain could be much of an obstacle to her. In the actual Greek mythology, a human/ god offspring is a demigod, and like Hercules, is expected to be better than any human being. The same goes for the story logic here. So of course only another god could be much of a challenge to her. So I saw story logic, rather than the excessive influence of Christian dualism, in turning Ares into some kind of Satan in this movie. I was prepared to accept that for the sake of the story, which is, after all, fiction. But oh, they did so much more with him by the end.<br/><br/>Ares turned out to be completely different than Diana had thought. Not only was he a different person, with a different name and body, than she had thought, but his motivation turned out to be exactly the same as her own: to eliminate evil by killing it. Diana went to find Ares to kill him because she thought he was evil and responsible for war and suffering, and Ares was trying to kill humankind because he thought humans were evil and responsible for war and suffering. Diana and Ares were alike, two of a kind, in a way that went far beyond being brother and sister gods. Ares only appeared to be evil if one first centers humanity and bases moral judgments off of what benefits or harms humankind. It turned out, this was not a story of dualism at all, not a story of an evil being fighting a good being, but a story of two beings that share the same motivation and dedication to eradicating evil, but differ only on their opinion of mankind. This complicated view of how one defines evil was a truly wonderful thing to find in a superhero movie. <br/><br/>The hero's character arc<br/><br/>Diana starts out as a young idealist and enthusiast of the fighting arts from a warrior culture that believes in love in the abstract, toward humanity. Along the way she loses her naivety and gains romantic, attached love. She develops as a warrior and hero the more she loses her fascination with fighting for its own sake and gives her attention to saving others, especially those she loves. That is a standard journey of maturity for a hero, and it barely references her gender except in the details. The bones of the story could have been told about any superhero; the story was fleshed out in such a way that Wonder Woman was both truly a wonder and most definitely a woman, and those two things did not conflict with each other."

","Wow. I have to say, DC. I am impressed. My brother and I both like reviewing movies and discussing them together, and most people, I am guessing, thought, 'wow, this is going to be an average movie, not too spectacular, but just about average.' and, I have to say, the beginning of the movie was a little rough for me, but it got better and better!<br/><br/>So, it made the audience think halfway through the movie if the god Aries actually existed or not, or if Wonder Woman's island society actually were right about Aries. The mystery of who he might be and if he really exists or not makes people sit there and think. I love the movies that make you think. I loved ""Inception"" because of all of the big words and confusing concepts in it, which made me love it because I actually had to think! I hate the movies that tell you everything and just make you sit there and watch. I mean, come on, it's not very interesting just sitting there and watching a movie.<br/><br/>This is by far the best DC movie I have ever seen since the Superman of 1980. That is how bad DC has gotten. ""Suicide Squad"" was a total flop. I expected something better of you, DC. And ""Batman Vs. Superman"" was definitely utter garbage. Everyone was anticipating those two movies to be the DC comebacks, but they both turned out being the same trash DC has been writing ever since the 70s and 80s.<br/><br/>In ""Wonder Woman"" I absolutely loved Chris Pine's character. It was a bummer in the ending what happened to him, though. I must admit, that's why I gave it a 9 instead of 10, because I became so attached to his character that I cried in the ending because of him. He is a great actor, and I bet he has a great career ahead of him in acting. Gal Gadot's acting wasn't exactly idyllic, but it was pretty decent. Definitely above average.<br/><br/>I loved the story line! And I totally didn't see that twist where Sir Patrick ended up being Aries! That is awesome! I mean, I knew it wasn't that Ludendorff guy all along-but it still made you wonder who it was all along. <br/><br/>So, overall, this movie deserves a 9 out of 10-it's a complete masterpiece to me. Thank you DC!"
"kennyforrest96","7","5","14","13 June 2017"," Good But Could Have Been Better
","Overall Wonder Woman, starring Gal Gadot and Chris Pine, was a good film, but I think with a few alterations it could have been phenomenal. It starts off a little slow while director Patty Jenkins explains Diana's past and her encounter with Steve, but begins to pick up once Diana and Steve leave for London. Throughout the movie, the audience gets to watch as Wonder Woman experiences the world outside of Themyscira and all the hatred that comes with the war. Speaking of the war, the best part of the film is when Diana rushes out of the trenches directly into German gunfire. This scene really shows how strong Wonder Woman is not just physically, but emotionally as well, and it demonstrates to the audience what exactly Diana is passionate about. The color scheme during the London and war scenes and that of Themyscira clash brilliantly. At the beginning the colors are vibrant compared to the dark, gloomy, dull colors of the war torn Europe. Finally, the end battle between Diana and Ares seemed very repetitive with her getting knocked down and then getting up just to get knocked right back down. And the purpose for Wonder Woman, Steve, and the remaining allies to fight being love, friendship, and determination seemed very clichÃ© and cheesy. In general, Wonder Woman made for a very good film and an essential for the DCEU. I am very interested to see where the DCEU goes next."

","I could hardly wait for the WW release given her engaging performance in Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice. <br/><br/>I was not disappointed at all. The movie was fast paced, thoughtful, offered strong performances, and overall a good watch. My test question of ""how long is this movie"" was never realized meaning my attention never wavered. CGI clearly is important for the supernatural scenes especially, but IMHO they were decent.<br/><br/>While many reviewers talk about the cinematic elements of this movie, I reflected on many of the cultural implications of the story and castings. It is a world movie. WASPs were not the superheroes in this film, but clearly a variety from who-knows-where made the movie so much stronger. It makes the case for working collectively on threats of cruelty, inhumanity, violence, and others. It is NOT a lecture film pushing you in any direction other than humanity elements of good vs evil need our superheroes. Gods and humanity both were examined and brought to life whether evil or not.<br/><br/>Now that I have said that, I only thought about these issues after the movie, and during the movie I was thoroughly engaged with the action. It was a smart and satisfying experience. It deserves my 10 out of ten score. I cannot imagine a better casting choice for Wonder Woman than Gadot. Pine was excellent. And there were some surprises. And Lynda Carter even received ""special thanks"" in the final credits."

I did enjoy The Dark Knight in 2008 with Heath Ledger in probably his finest performance of all time. And I must now add Gal Gadot to that list of performances that left me cheering for more! I also enjoyed Batman Vs.Superman but mainly due to Ben Affleck.

","Much can be said about why certain films are a success. Do I think Wonder Woman is an entirely amazing or original film? Not at all. Do I think it has enough distinct features to succeed as what is easily one of the best superhero films of this decade? Definitely. It's great that here we have a film that actually tackles more relevant themes that include the brutality of war and humankind, rather than another generic Marvel ""Let's save the world from this evil supernatural guy."" The entire storyline and villains aren't a complete success, and sometimes there's some awkwardness to be found. However, the two leads of the film, Gal Gadot and Chris Pine, are endlessly charming and have such electric chemistry. Truly a great duo. Their dialogue together make up the best sections of the film and they're fantastic together. For that reason the film succeeds as much as it does."

But did you SEE all those VFX people in the credits? Holy moly. It was like 4 entire companies and I'm pretty sure one company was hired solely for horse hair and one on water. Seriously there was a ton of VFX.<br/><br/>There were also a couple of jumps where their trajectories made no sense and that bugged me. There was also a tad too much CG but I appreciated that the entire movie was like that versus in the hobbit where you could CLEARLY tell when they were adding them - aka Smaug / Legolas.<br/><br/>The bad guy was great but I wish they switched out the actor after the reveal. After being hyped up the entire movie it was odd to see Aries end up being so scrawny. I do agree that he did have the gravitas of Aries which may have been hard to transfer if they did switch actors. I mean he did look good in that shirtless scene but he's no Jason Mamoa (which BTW I can't wait for, I love Aquaman).<br/><br/>There were some subtle nuances that I really appreciated in it though that definitely had a lot of thought to it. It made scenes more realistic and less forced. The acting was also really good and the costuming was on point. Story was great, pacing was great, super pretty, and amazing acting. I'd probably give it an 8-9/10 on rotten tomatoes."

After all, it's all business, but for me it also matters the quality, plot and resolution of the film.<br/><br/>It is not to compare but for something Marvel has grown so much because it has adapted to this new era and somehow has challenged reality. DC Comics has stalled in a big black hole. There are no influential characters.<br/><br/>How sad that movies gain popularity and status by name and not by quality.

","""It is our sacred duty to defend the world. And it is what I am going to do."" Diana (Gal Gadot)<br/><br/>That's a simple manifesto spoken by Amazonian princess Diana, aka to us Wonder Woman. Here's a DC Comics hero to go nose to nose with the big boys from Marvel, at least on a par with the best of them. You go, Girl.<br/><br/>From Diana's island paradise, Themyscria, to the WWI front lines, she remains steadfast in her goal to rid the world of war, starting with the one to end all wars. That she cannot end any of our wild wars, even as a demigod, is a lesson she learns.<br/><br/>That simplicity is also naivety, but innocence is part of her charm leading to a satisfactory second act where the comedy is affecting in a heroine-out-of water motif in London. <br/><br/>The love affair between her and spy Steve (Chris Pine) may be the best this summer because like her, it has innocence and idealism all in one. Although Pine's role may seem to be better written, the actors have an unmistakable chemistry. Do the characters make love? See for yourself, and let me know if you like the answer.<br/><br/>The scenes of the origin at the island have a freshness I haven't seen this summer. Amazonian women fly like Cirque-du-Soleil acrobats to dispatch German soldiers; Queen Hippolyta (Connie Neilsen) and her sister, Antiope (Robin Wright), are as believable warriors as Thor and Wolverine, and certainly just as pretty. The idea of an island of competent women does more for feminism than all the high-blown speeches of sociologists, and without the rant.<br/><br/>How Diana and Steve help the war to its armistice is part of the film's fun to figure out. The film does not have the rampant sardonic humor of the mature Marvel series (although the mercenary soldiers are amusing), and it relies too much in the third act on those old superhero staples, electricity and excessive mayhem. Yet it does have a heroine more interesting than many of the males who have dominated the genre. <br/><br/>Wait, wait! Could a reason for its success be that it's directed by a competent Patty Jenkins? Female hero, female director. That's a Marvelous combination!"

This is the hype I don't understand and I don't know which movie is worse Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Man of Steel or this one? A lot of people hate to death Suicide Squad and say it is the worst DC movie that come out in my opinion I didn't mind Suicide Squad I thought was an okay time waster but wasn't that god awful horrible movie to me that's my opinion! Will Smith and Margot Robbie were good I liked those two. Wonder Woman is horrible f****** horrible mess it is way too long, too boring just like Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice both are horrible sh**y movies. The first day of watching I come to 52 min's of the first half then I had to turn off this movie and I had to continue next day and by the end of the fighting scene I fall a sleep so bad this movie was.<br/><br/>I personally felt that this movie copied and stole the ideas from Captain America: The First Avenger I thought Gal Gadot imitated Captain America this movie tried to be Captain America: The First Avenger on a s***y way and it failed miserably! I also thought this movie stole and copied on the s***y way Thor when the villain on the end of the movie pops out and acts like a god and keeps talking about gods, I thought this movie stole scenes from Thor and make it in to one movie, sorry this is just my opinion. It is way too long, too boring, too overrated over the place. Gal Gadot sucks she is so terrible and one of the worst actress on the screen. Gal Gadot couldn't fake American accent and she was so terrible she didn't know how to act. I hated her in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and I said she was useless and wasted in this movie she is god awful make her stop she is terrible.<br/><br/>I saw one of the worst fake CGI ever in the inter movie. Action and fight's? No they are all CGI the crap CGI all over the movie. The shootouts and gun battles in WWII are unrealistic you can see it is all CGI and it is not real. A Wonder Woman goes in to WWII and ends WWII and wins the war for us?! The writers for this movie must be a brainless morons you know it was Hitler in WWII the leader right? Here he isn't even mentioned at all these people must be really that dumb? Are people really buying this in this movie? The origin of this movie was pointless and over long over boring over dull over slow really slow paced. I hated the slow motion in this movie it was so fake that my eyes hurt.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is terrible awful she is so horrible crap actress for a lead she is horrible not just here but in the most of the movies I have seen her. In Fast & Furious movie she was so good that she was invisible to me. Criminal the only reason I watch it was Kevin Costner the movie was good because of Kevin Costner. She was horrible and god awful with her fake ascent and the worst part of the film for me. With her un tolerable dialogue I thought she didn't had the talent for playing Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>This movie is a disappointment a failure and a let down and it stole scenes from Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor and yes those two movies were way better movies in my opinion.<br/><br/>Personally I have nothing against lead actresses they are so many good actresses that are forgotten and they are better at acting then Gal Gadot: Amy Steel from Friday the 13th Part 2 and April Fool's Day much better actress then Gal Gadot she was better at acting then this sh**y god damn awful actress, did she get anything? nothing! Lar Park-Lincoln I liked her hell more in Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood way much better actress. Shawnee Smith in the Blob from 1988 did a great job was a strong character was a bad ass was a much 100 times better actress than Gal Gadot but did Shawnee Smith get anything? No. Heather Langenkamp from A Nightmare on Elm Street and New Nightmare she was much better actress I love Heather she is better then Gal Gadot and she did got nothing. Amanda Pays from Leviathan and The Flash is much better actress then Gal Gadot. Lisa Wilcox from A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master and A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child was much, much better actress way better than Gal Gadot! did she get anything? No. Gal Gadot got all awards but must of these actresses are forgotten and didn't get nothing for their work! She get's the praise for this movies while other actresses did not got anything! <br/><br/>DC movies I think are better in my opinion: Superman I,II and III with Christopher Reeve, Supergirl, Tim Burton's Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever, The Dark Knight, Constantine, Green Lantern and Suicide Squad. DC Animated films: The Dark Knight Returns with Peter Weller Batman: Under the Red Hood, The New Frontier, The Flashpoint Paradox, Batman/Superman: Public Enemies, Justice League: War <br/><br/>This movie can kiss my ass f*** this awful STINKER S**t movie F 1/10 avoid like a plague of this abomination!!"

","I should probably start off by saying that I grew up watching Wonder Woman on television every afternoon. She was a part of my Monday through Friday viewing and I grew up wanting to be Wonder Woman (or any other type of strong female lead) when playing pretend with my male counterparts. It was with this myths in mind that I set to watching this movie during the Fourth of July holiday last night.<br/><br/>Without giving away any spoilers, this movie started off by showing the backstory that was never fully explored in the show. (Some of us superhero nerds don't actually read comic books, but appreciate the genre and the robust characters they have created.) I was thrilled to the point of shaking in my seat as backstory turned into action sequences that I would defy a male-dominated entertainment industry to find fault with.<br/><br/>Perhaps my review is based partly on nostalgia, but what reviewer of any comic book/superhero is not nostalgic? If you're drawn to the genre, you're drawn to strong archetype characters.<br/><br/>I was in tears throughout the film because so many of the themes and dialogue expressed by Diana Prince (aka Wonder Woman), were ideas that I've tried impressing on my sons and daughter throughout the course of my tenure in raising them. (Two of my sons were with my husband and I last night and laughed that some of the dialogue was verbatim to some of the lectures/talks they got growing up.)<br/><br/>Wonder Woman taught us Gen-Xer women that we could be strong, we didn't need to be mean, that taking charge of a tense situation didn't make us ""bitchy"", our relationship to others was what made us stronger, to stand up for the weak, and to look good while doing it. Being a strong female was a good thing. Not needing to be rescued was a point of pride. :)<br/><br/>I'm happy to see from this film that my ""take away"" from Wonder Woman growing up would appear to be a shared ideal. (I must confess that I never have spoken with any of my female friends about Wonder Woman and don't remember speaking to any girls when I was younger either.)<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins was flawless in her Direction from the start to the credits (which are vaguely reminiscent of James Bond).<br/><br/>I would recommend to anyone to see this film.

","Really? This movie has been getting great reviews, and I was really excited to see it. I get that it's cool that there is a strong female lead, but that doesn't automatically make it a good movie. At the beginning of the movie, the acting and writing is painfully clichè, which is rare in modern superhero movies. It gradually gets better, but there are still parts that make you want to die throughout the movie. I don't know how all of the rotten tomatoes critics are overlooking the plot holes in this film. There are probably more plot holes in this movie than planets in the universe. The writing is really cliché. Before a character does something important, they have a dramatic, five minute speech. There is one part where an evil person shouts: ""I WILL DESTROY YOU!"" I was laughing really hard at how bad the writing and acting was in that scene. It then launched into a fully CGI fight. And as for the story: it isn't really that good, and there is a plethora of plot holes. The acting is mediocre, and it is really lacking humor."

It really suits her, just like Robert Downey Jr. was born to play Iron Man, or Hugh Jackman to play Wolverine, I really think she is the perfect choice to play Wonder Woman. Music in the movie was excellent, visuals were really good for the most part of the movie, and costumes were pretty good too.<br/><br/>Now that we got those things out of the way, we have negatives, and boy is that a long list. Casting for this movie was horrible. I cannot express how bad it was. Every single character besides Gal Gadot's was horrible, acting was over the top, at moments reminded me of villains from Austin Powers. Character development was non- existent. People just appear from out of nowhere, they introduce themselves and that's it, literally no explanation or what they do, or even why are they in the movie, they have no purpose, nor do they contribute to the story line. I am trying not to give any spoilers, so I am not mentioning any names, but I was shocked with the choice and development of the main bad guy. He was horrible. Movie has dark and serious tone, but they tried to break that with a few silly jokes, and corny humor, which completely didn't work. Script was bad. Really bad. They tried to pull female version of Captain America, but they failed miserably. I really don't wanna watch another Wonder Woman movie, at least not in Cinema, maybe I would pirate it, because it was worth no money.<br/><br/>And yes, rating that it has got, it is really feminist-hyped for no obvious reason. Movie is truly bad."

","Not much of a spoiler but the same old story of a hero growing up without knowing his/her powers. Suddenly realizes their powers and then a big fight with a more powerful enemy who comes out of shadows and that too without any valid reason<br/><br/>More or less Man of Steel with a female protagonist but the plot of MoS was better and the villain too And also trying too​ hard to be a feminist movie by objectifying men"

It got to the point where Wonder Woman is charging across no man's land, machine gun bullets bouncing off her bracelets, and I could bear it no longer. Why bring the First World War into it? That wasn't a time of superheroes, to be made light of.

","Born of the ancient Greek gods, ""Diana"" (Gal Gadot) lives on a isolated and unchartered island with the Amazons who train her to be the most skilled warrior possible. Then one day she sees an airplane in the skies which crashes in the ocean near the island and she rushes out to save the occupant. It's then that she discovers that this person is a man-and she has never seen one before as her entire island is populated by females. But before she can get much information from him the island is attacked by German soldiers who are eventually killed in a very fierce battle. Not long afterward she is told that his name is ""Captain Steve Trevor"" (Chris Pine) and he is an American soldier working with British Intelligence. Not only that, but he also tells her that the entire world is involved in a war on the scale of something that has never happened before. So having already witnessed the ruthlessness of the Germans, she decides to go with Captain Trevor to London to track down and kill the individual responsible-Aires, the God of War. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good ""Comic Book movie"" which had plenty of action and an interesting plot. Likewise, the presence of an attractive actress like Gal Gadot certainly didn't hurt matters either. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this film and have rated it accordingly."
"livia-49912","10","3","7","28 August 2018"," An Amazing Way to See Diana Finally On the Big Screen!
","I was blown away by this film, to see Diana go from animated to Live action was awesome. Yes Lynda Carter was great as 'Wonder Woman' in her 1975 hit show, which will never be forgotten. It was a shame that it only went to three seasons, I watched a few episodes. But I need to catch up on all three seasons. <br/><br/>Anyway, the way that Patty Jenkins imagined the film made me feel like a kid all over again. It was like seeing Wonder Woman for the first time all over again. Patty really knows how to use history, I am a sucker for history. Gal Gadot is the perfect Wonder Woman to get the job done. I am so glad that Zack chose her to play Diana, I couldn't think of anyone else to play her. <br/><br/>The warehouse fighting scene was absolutely amazing, to see Diana take out all of those soldiers on each floor was breath taking. Also the No Mans Land scene was so great that I was speechless. I still watch the film, I can't get annoyed by this film at all. I cannot wait until the next installment of Wonder Woman."

"madplayer-55528","5","3","7","3 April 2018"," Decent but overrated and lazy movie.
","Is this movie the best recent DC movie? Yes, but this isn't very hard to achieve, with such terrible titles such as Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad. So this movie is decent, we can all agree on that, but that's it. It's no masterpiece. The Plot is lazy and all characters except for Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor lack any connection or arc.<br/><br/>This movie could've been better, if it hadn't taken itself so seriously. Take marvel as an example. Their movies aren't great, but they know that their movies are ridiculous, comedic action movies. They use it to their advantage.
This movie tries to make us question our morality, but then makes a dumb joke or contradicts what they try to teach us.<br/><br/>Wonder woman, for example, blames Ares for the war and thinks that humans are pacifist creatures, but then Wonder Woman kills German soldiers. This movie has to make up it's mind. Is Wonder Woman a pacifist like Gandhi or just brutal and heartless like Deadpool!<br/><br/>The ending is the worst though. Steve tries to teach Wonder Woman throughout the movie, that there isn't one person to blame for the war. Humans are just messed up. This part is actually pretty good, it made me feel something, but then Ares comes and says that he was the bad guy all along. 
This ruins what the movie tried to teach us. They wasted it all for a laughable and boring fight scene.<br/><br/>Speaking of fight scene. This movie is not a good action film. The fight scenes are poorly executed and shot, and that terrible wonder woman theme song always plays in the background. I know many people like the theme song, but for me it's totally misplaced. It's like a rock cover. That doesn't match to a WW movie. Even when I listen to the song without the movie, many friends tell me it's great, but it's just ok, nothing I would listen to, and I like Rock and Metal.<br/><br/>Compared to the horrible recent DC movies, this movie is great, but compared to Superhero movies (marvel and the Dark Knight trilogy) this movie blows. Don't waste your time. This movie won't make you feel anything. After the movie I wasn't angry, sad or happy."

","Diana sees that although Humanity is capable of great evil, there is ""so much more"" to them. This is a very touching movie, in spite of the great deal of violence. 
In opposition to the comment in the Frequently Asked Questions section, I believe that the death of Ludendorff indicates that, in the Wonder Woman universe, World War II might have been averted. Ludendorff invented the ""stab in the back"" myth that the German army was not defeated on the field of battle, and that the surrender of Germany was due to the betrayal of the army by civilians on the home front, especially by Jews. This idea was picked up by Nationalists, e.g., Hitler. Without the stab in the back myth, perhaps Hitler would never have been able to seize power, and therefore, no WWII."

","I made the mistake of going to see this at 9 at night. As a stay at home mom with a toddler and a preschooler, this was not my best decision, but hey, margaritas were involved. Anyway, the movie was excellent but for a few mehs in my opinion.<br/><br/>First the pros, it was nice to see a strong female lead who was able to take care of herself. I know Diana is a comic character written years upon years ago, but I liked that the director and story moved with her development from a idealistic ""girl"" to a jaded woman to a demigod willing to protect humanity from itself if need be. I liked that she was physically superior to the male lead but didn't feel the need to flaunt it. And she could hold her own intellectually. I'm a huge action nerd, so the fight scenes were amazing! And, unlike Batman Vs Superman, which I had to force myself to finish, it had an involving story. I felt connected to the characters and enjoyed the telling of their story.<br/><br/>The cons, of course her outfit. I honestly couldn't imagine saying, ""I'm going to fight the Nazis"" (I can't even type it without hearing Brad Pitt from Inglorious Basterds doing voice-over) then pick out my shiniest unitard, and thigh high boots, but you do you girl. I also didn't like that, having read not one of the comics nor seen any reviews/articles on it, I was able to pick out the bad guy the first time he showed up on camera. Maybe I'm jaded, but it's getting way too easy to figure out who done it. And the Wonder Woman theme. Y'all, I had nightmares with that song playing over and over for days. They played it to the point I wanted to stuff the popcorn in my ears instead of my mouth.<br/><br/>All in all though, it was entertaining, it had a love scene, the fight scenes are still awesome (explosions everywhere!!!) and it had a great cast who did a terrific job selling the story."

","This movie has heart, humor and non gratuitous action. It surprised me because I expected to be disappointed since DC movies are usually pretty bad. Like Superman in Man Of Steel this main character, Wonderwoman, has a calm and innocence about her which is quite attractive. The plot has some small holes in it and it does jump forwards in time quite often but it's a popcorn action movie so that's fine. This is definitely one of the better DC universe movies in my opinion. Go see it without expecting to be 'marvelled' and you will be pleasantly entertained."

So I went. I am not familiar with Comic Universes, but familiar a bit with Greek mythology. Too many inconsistencies. At least I could see enough skin to keep my primitive male brain occupied.<br/><br/>The movie itself was good, hence eight but why all this chick flick stuff in an action movie? Every time I got pumped following the action, some stereotypical romantic comedy thing came up, leaving me confused. <br/><br/>Effects were good, but ripping Neo bullet scene was I think unnecessary.

","I grew up in the Linda Carter era and remember the male response to her physique well. She was perceived as a bimbo by many and received no respect. That memory made me oppose the idea of this movie. ""Here we go again.""<br/><br/>What changed my mind was reading some initial reviews by women and looking at Gal Gadot's bio. I was astonished to read a woman say she was going to take her daughters to see the film. That could only mean strong approval for Gal Gadot's presentation, and no 'jiggle-factor'. Reading that she was a combat instructor in the Israeli Army as well as being a former Miss Israel was intriguing. This might work! Seeing it was a great experience!<br/><br/>I am not a sociologist, but ""Wonder Woman"" seems to come at a time when girls/women are yearning for an ideal heroine they can own. Strong female disapproval of this film would have killed it in days. Gal Gadot superbly provides a believable, fully-developed character that taps into what women want. A woman director was the key to ""Wonder Woman"". Chris Pine, Robin Wright, and Connie Nielson are all effective in shaping Wonder Woman's growth and evolution as a person. Well recommended, BUT, the final climactic battle is way Overdone. It follow the same kitchen-sink formula as Man of Steel, Transformers, etc."

I don't think Gal Gadot is the best actress in the world but she did fine there were a few moments where I thought that it didn't completely sell, but it did not take away from my experience in the movie. Chris Pine was great in this movie and I wish he played a more dominant role in the DCEU like a Hal Jordan or an Oliver Queen. Wonder Womans theme was great like it was BvS. The cinematography in this movie was actually really good and the colors palate was different and fresh compared to the typical DC movie. A lot of the issues I have with Wonder Woman are spoilers, but also very minor. Overall this movie is a solid 8.2/10.

"Equalizer16","8","3","7","5 June 2017"," The Right film for the Moment
","As the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) has not had a great track record so far, a lot of hope has been put into the Queen of the Amazons, and a very well done to director Patty Jenkins I have to say. It looks like there is hope for the DCEU after all.<br/><br/>Ambitious Amazon Warrior Diana (Gal Gadot) seeks to fight for good and triumph over evil, but is restrained by her mother, until USA Army spy Steven Trevor (Chris Pine) accidentally lands in the hidden Amazon island, Diana fins her opportunity to become a great hero as Trevor tells about the great war of all wars bringing terror to his world. Accompanying him to the First World War, Diana is determined to bring an end to the suffering and promote piece.<br/><br/>Not paying tribute the cheesy 70s show, Wonder Woman becomes its own film, fitting into the classic superhero criteria and being a mash up of others. Its Superman meets Thor, meets Captain America. Patty Jenkins has put the DCEU on track with a exciting, surprisingly fun adventure.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot wielding the Lasso of truth, really invests in her character as a spectacular ambitious warrior princess but also a caring morally strong figure dedicated to bringing about peace. It is great to see probably the first great female superhero film, matching the quality of a classic marvel film, but also with no female gaze at all, and just so enriching to see this strong female lead be the driving force of power and good.<br/><br/>Supporting her brave acts is Chris Pine being pretty much Chris Pine but not in a captain Kirk way, but as an admirable noble fighter, and love interest of the female lead, not a damsel in distress, just with amusing quirkiness.<br/><br/>Although it starts fairly slow and shall I say a tad awkward in atmosphere, what escalates is a journey of gorgeous fun and thrills, really air punching excitement and joy. It may appear as another dark shady Snyder esc CGI parade is actually much more depend in its substance and values, but still including is grand a special effects performance. One of the great surprises was its heart and moral themes examining human nature and violence and war, which is mostly brought to life by the leading lady herself. With all that is going on in the world at the moment, I really do think we could all do with a bit of Diana Prince, encouraging us with high spirited drive for peace.<br/><br/>What is one of it strengths is the fact that the film does take time to establish story and context, which is then beautifully combined with the grand action sequences. Maybe too many slow Mo action shots for my taste but still wonderfully put together thrilling set pieces. Accompanied by Rupert Gregson-Williams' music, we enter an empowering tone of heroics and spirit. As per usual, they just can't resist that big CGI ending, as we do bare witness to another explosive final act, that is not as heavy as BvS or mad as Man of Steal, but still remains part of this growing superhero tradition.<br/><br/>What can only be said is just a great fun experience, and hope for the future of the DCEU. I do really hope to see more of Wonder Woman, and really do recommend this to be a encouraging film for the moment. It may be unlikely that is message will reach the whole world, but still acts n its own as an inspiring portrait. 8.4/10"
"themovieparadise","8","3","7","4 June 2017"," Best DC Movie Since Man of Steel By Far!
","Ever since Gal Gadot was first cast to play Wonder Woman, I was skeptical of her. She had only been acting for a couple of years, and I didn't believe she really had what it took to carry a franchise like this. She was good in Batman v. Superman, but she had only a handful of lines and a few minutes of total screen time. But I have to say, I was very pleased with her performance in this movie. It wasn't groundbreaking or anything like that, but she showed a lot of range that I didn't think she was capable of. She hits the emotional and the comedic beats equally well, as well as the action sequences. She captures the physicality of the role excellently, which I believe was her strongest suit. I went in nervous about how she would do, and she surpassed all of my expectations! So I give major props to her. Chris Pine is also fantastic in this movie! He is certainly a better actor than Gadot, but director Patty Jenkins does an excellent job of balancing the two so that Pine never truly outshines Gadot. But I think the biggest thing that needed to be pulled off in this film was Gadot and Pine's chemistry, and it was radiant. If that didn't work, then I don't think this movie would have worked as a whole. But it does, and it only elevates the two actors..."
"williethemole","8","3","7","3 June 2017"," Good movie, not perfect but certainly worth watching
","Everybody has an opinion so I make it a point to read both good and bad movie reviews on this site. ""Wonder Woman"" was not perfect, so few movies made today are. I can agree with the 1 star rating naysayers on a point or two as it indeed needed a little more action, the CGI is pretty obvious at times and it did contain a bit of the obligatory Hollywood commentary on the current state of modern society. Having said that, none of the above made this movie unwatchable. In fact, it was quite good.<br/><br/>However, the poster who claimed Gil Gadot is less attractive than Lynda Carter has lost his mind, or at the very least, his eye sight. Lynda Carter was/is a beautiful actress, but she can't polish Gadot's magic wrist bands. The Israeli actress is a wonder to look at and her acting in ""Wonder Woman"" was good enough. <br/><br/>Good flick. Go see it."

","Gal Gadot IS Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>For all those out there who have witnessed the previous incarnations of Wonder Woman, you will know exactly what I mean. Gadot's interpretation is compassionate and fierce with a hint of naivety and a smattering of humour. She is the best I have seen for this character and the closest to the characterisation in the comics, of which I have many.<br/><br/>I never got bored throughout this movie, which I thought was well paced and beautifully filmed, perfectly capturing the introduction of a Goddess, not a super heroine, into what was then modern-day warfare. I am just sorry I didn't get to see it on the big screen.<br/><br/>To all those commenting on her legs and feminine charms, what the hell has it got to do with the movie itself? Get over yourselves!

","With stunning cinematography, jaw-dropping war scenes, and an iconic and hopeful portrayal not seen since the likes of Reeve's Superman, Wonder Woman is the film DC's 75-year old hero deserves. 9.6/10<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>It would not be unfair to say that the DCEU's fate was riding on Wonder Woman's reception. After a divisive and polarizing trio of films in Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Suicide Squad, both die-hard DC fans (like myself) and DCEU haters were hoping to not have this endless debate again with WW and get a universally and critically- liked film that would perform well at the box office and please everyone. Well, thankfully, that's exactly what we got. <br/><br/>Pros: For one, the cinematography and location settings are absolutely BEAUTIFUL. You truly believe that Themyscira is a place of fantasy with how stunning (and colorful- a huge DCEU complaint for many, myself included) it looks. Even London, with its purposely dreary atmosphere to show the marked difference between Amazons and lower humans, is still well-shot and crafted in things like shots and mise-en-scene.<br/><br/>Next, Diana's training. Her portrayal as a young girl who just always wanted to fight will be inspiring for many girls, and rightfully so as that is the power of Wonder Woman and what I'm sure Jenkins was trying to achieve. The feminism factor is on full display here, and while some men will write it off, that is just unfair. That's what Wonder Woman was BUILT ON, being a game-changer in the world of superheroes by showing that a woman could beat up criminals just as well as a man, and in that sense Jenkins was spot-on in understanding the character.<br/><br/>The best part in the whole movie was the action/war scenes. They are absolutely jaw-dropping. Set in WWI, the portrayal of things like battles in the trenches and Wonder Woman fighting off a barricade of soldiers with guns is just stunning to behold, especially during my favorite scene of the movie and one of the most incredible scenes I've seen in a superhero scene: the No Man's Land scene. In the face of impossibility like charging a battalion of machine guns head-on, we get a hero who shines as a beacon of hope I have not seen or felt as invested in since the likes of Reeves' Superman in 1978.<br/><br/>The movie is also hilarious. It is so refreshing to see the DCEU not take itself too seriously as in the Snyder era, and actually have some fun too. Chris Pine and Gal Gadot's chemistry is so realistic and believable, unsurprising due to the fact that Jenkins revealed that entire scenes of the movie such as the Boat dialogue scene were entirely improvised and ad-libbed on the spot by Gadot and Pine. The jokes in the film were all spot-on too, unlike Marvel movies in which a sometimes large portion of the jokes are insultingly juvenile/cringy, ala Orange Slices in Civil War or Dance-Offs in GoTG.<br/><br/>Finally, Ares. The plot twist in Ares' identity reveal is downright shocking and threw me for an absolute loop. No possible way you could have seen that coming. It is one of the best kept secrets I have seen in a superhero film and an absolute gut-punch when it was revealed, reminiscent of Bucky's killing of Howard Stark in CA: Civil War but even more shocking. Besides his reveal, Ares' powers, costume, and overpowered-ness are insane. While Marvel has had a remarkable slew of weak villains in their on-going villain problem, DC absolutely shines in this category. The final Wonder Woman v Ares was epic.<br/><br/>Now, the cons (Few): First, Ares' costume. While Ares is an incredible villain, perhaps my favorite in the entire DCEU which has had strong villain entries consistently, I have a problem with his appearance: his mask. The metal look is serviceable, although I would have preferred the blue costume from the comics. But, I don't understand why they didn't obscure his face a little better in the mask, creating the shadow in between his eyes that made him so anonymously frightening in the comics.<br/><br/>Also, the beginning and ending framing were unnecessary and I wish they weren't there. You have an incredible story and brilliant execution by Gadot and Pine, so why frame it with a modern-day look-back on the memory instead of just starting the movie in Themyscira? And throwing in Batman for no reason, I love Batman but why throw him into every movie even as an Easter Egg?<br/><br/>Finally, Steve Trevor's ending. Why end his story? I get that WWI happened a long time ago from where Justice League is set, but Steve Trevor is supposed to be Wonder Woman's main love interest, and his end seemed premature. The ending works for this film alone, but it could pose a problem in the sequel.<br/><br/>Overall, while there are flaws, they are so minor that they don't really affect the movie as a whole. Wonder Woman is a triumph for superhero movies and easily one of the greatest ever.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Most Memorable Moment(s): 1. No Man's Land fight, 2. Wonder Woman v. Ares final fight and plot twist<br/><br/>Pros: Visually stunning form and cinematography, jaw-dropping action and war scenes, amazing fight choreography, Hilarious jokes a refreshing and welcome addition in DCEU, sure-handed direction from Jenkins, an iconic and hopeful portrayal by Gadot we haven't seen since the likes of Reeve in '78, Great chemistry between Gadot and Pine, overall strong acting and writing, incredible and shocking plot twist in the Ares reveal<br/><br/>Cons: Ares' costume could've been a tiny bit better (helmet area more obscuring), the beginning and ending framing of the story were unnecessary, Steve Trevor's ending<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9.6/10"

I did, I flipped through it, and was instantly addicted and hooked on the glory that was the Amazonian Princess, Wonder Woman!<br/><br/>Even being a guy, I hated....no, I despised movies and TV shows that had women in them who were always the ""poor little female"", cowering under the big bad men who were either abusing them or harassing them. Wonder Woman was anything BUT that. A woman who didn't take ""NO"" for an answer, a woman who kicked butt and did't take crap from NO man! And she did it with grace, style, and class, even if it meant she had to get ""down and dirty"" once in a while.<br/><br/>Then Lynda Carter hit the small screen in a BIG way. The first season of Wonder Woman the TV show, she WAS Wonder Woman! Beauty, brains, brawn, and wisdom of the ages. She epitomized the whole heart of what Wonder Woman is and has been.<br/><br/>Even though the comic books have changed her and even belittled her in some formats, she's still got the power of the woman I came to adore when I really needed a friend, back in my teen years.<br/><br/>Now, as for the movie.........<br/><br/>I saw this review online, and it speaks my sentiments exactly. <br/><br/>""I shall yell ""TRIPE"" whenever tripe is served, and I shall continue to do so as long as Hollywood serves up tripe and sells it as ""filet mignon""!!!<br/><br/>Horrible movie! Worst acting job I've ever seenÂ…. Most catastrophic casting I've ever seen in my life! Is it a ""Wonder"" that Marvel is raking in the big bucks, since they obviously KNOW HOW to choose the RIGHT people! They couldn't have picked a WORSE person to play Wonder Woman! In fact, they've completely ruined the legacy of the Amazon.<br/><br/>DC, again, just serving tripe and claiming it's filet mignon! <br/><br/>Wonder Woman fans have been teased and starved for SO long by DC, that it's obvious they will eat up anything at this point and think it's the best thing ever. Sad really.<br/><br/>You feed a starving dog a bowl of crap, it's gonna gobble it up thinking it's the best food ever! Thats whats going on here! DC has teased and starved WW fans for so long, they think this nauseating attempt at a REAL Wonder Woman is something special, when it's nothing more than tripe, crap, and a huge slap in the face to the Wonder Woman legacy, as well as a kick in the face to REAL Wonder Woman fans! <br/><br/>And feminists haven't had a strong female role model since Sigourney Weaver hit the screen in the Alien saga, so they are ready to take anything they can get in the way of women kicking butt on the screen, even if it is garbage.<br/><br/>The lack of taste and high expectations from the public nowadays is completely appalling.<br/><br/>A now, EX-fan of the REAL Wonder Woman.""<br/><br/>I am still a fan of the ORIGINAL, REAL Wonder Woman. But I am NOT a fan of this horrific monstrosity DC is trying to pass off as ""excellent"". <br/><br/>The story of Wonder Woman is a good one, no matter WHO tells it. However, the people who portray the characters in the story are something altogether different. And these people, as stated above, are the worst. I would say that DC couldn't have picked a worse person to portray Wonder Woman, but then again............George Clooney as Batman. Nuff said."
"lschouder-04582","4","6","19","3 June 2017"," All flash and hype. No substance
","This movie had absolutely zero character development. Chris Pine's character, Steve Carter, for example was so one-dimensional. His character had a few funny lines, spent the entire movie pleading with Diana to help his cause and that was about it. He carried the same tone of voice through out the entire film. He was so one-dimensional that by the time he sacrifices himself at the end I had zero emotion over it. I couldn't have cared less. The movie has a lot of cool shots but the lack of character development leaves you to simply feel numb as the empty action unfolds. <br/><br/>The big reveal about Diana's true past was empty as well. All it really meant was that she went from being a shot-gun to a cannon; it just meant she's a stronger weapon but didn't meaningfully change her. The reveal itself and the fact that it happened at the end of the film draws no emotion from the character because A.)it's unimportant and doesn't matter and B.)she's given no chance to reflect on it. The villain is completely neutered by admitting that, when it comes to mankind's destruction, he's pretty much been hands-off. He's barely even a bad guy in the whole thing. And how the hell do you have a WWII movie and not mention Hitler at least once? It's a long movie that somehow still felt rushed and as if nothing really happened. Patty Jenkins made it feel very Snyder-ish by making it all flash with cool shots and effects but having no substance. The parts that were supposed to contain emotion didn't because the entire film leading up to those points were executed poorly. It wasn't terrible by any means. It was about on par with Transformers and the like but it was far from Iron Man good. I was pretty disappointed."

","When we receive an artistic creation, we should not wear the robes of extreme seriousness because - paradoxically - we risk getting into derision ... And attention, I mean those who have the ability, competence (knowledge, skills) to issue judgments Value in this regard! ""Wonder Woman"" offers the world in the grip of the innocent soul of its own age, of course, but of course it does not justify the angry attacks that seek to disqualify it without the right to appeal from valuable artistic creations. It must be read among the rows / cadres making the concessions necessary for the younger age, as I was saying. Whatever might be said, the way in which ... the film treats the eternal theme of the struggle between good and evil still retains it in the gallery of valuable artistic creations. We are not talking about Oscar awards, masterpieces ... but from here to to throw it in the garbage (""Wonder Woman"") is a long way ... An interesting aspect - in a negative role is also a very beautiful woman physically, but ugly of her evil choice. There is a lot to say, but I would only stop on one aspect. Attacking ""Wonder Woman"" too serious advocates of the rigors of artistic creation move away from subtle truth. Let us now think about Romania, although we can offer many other examples. Are we intrigued by the way the film shows the physical strength of the heroine (exponent) Diana, of the female principle in general? Is it a young artistic representation? If so, let's say that Diana's amazing physical powers are small childhood in addition to the efforts and achievements they have done for the Romanian nation (in a context of hell) Queen Maria or Ecaterina Teodoroiu ... And not only They obviously. ""Wonder Woman"" is a film that tells the younger age a fundamental truth: love is true to the extent that it is unconditional, and the ultimate test is the acceptance of personal sacrifice when needed."
"nguyenluke","10","5","15","8 July 2017"," Great movie and responding to the complaints to this movie
","Holy moly, this movie was fun. For all the people who reviewed this movie as bad, let me explain. The plot was simple clean and done correctly. Not too complex. Many reviews I heard said it's basically the same thing as Captain America. Well that's just too bad because this movie stayed true to the comics. Is it bad for a movie to be true to the comics. Of course not. Some people never read the comics and just judge the movie without even reading the damn comics. They only judge by watching the movies both Wonder Woman and Captain America. Saying oh it's too similar. Also, another issue saying it completely defies logic well.. what do you know.. this movie is listed science ""FICTION"" and FANTASY. So of course some things are not realistic and some are CGI cause something like this movie would really not happen in reality. Some people thought the movie was boring and barely action. Well its an origin story, its going to tell you how Diana became Wonder Woman, with these small parts that help define the character, like the scene when Steve shows her to dance. Many others thought it didn't show how Diana actually became Wonder Woman.. and I'm like bish are you blind? It basically shows how in this movie.. like are you serious? And also its not like a feminist movie. It was actually a very equal movie. Its like a Ghostbusters (2016) reminding me that I'm an awful human being cause I'm a man. Overall, this movie was fantastic. I recommend on watching it if you love the comics."
"gotmyorangecrush","9","5","15","6 July 2017"," Without Question the Best film in the DCEU to Date, BY FAR!!
","Like many people, I went into Wonder Woman hoping for the best, but having serious doubts due to DC's previous entries in the DCEU. In my opinion, there were many reasons why DC's DCEU films were coming out mediocre at best, but the one that stood out the most for me was the fact that the films were simply trying to be WAY too serious. There was absolutely no lightheartedness or humor and IMO, those kinds of scenes are extremely important as they really help to break up the action scenes and more serious scenes. Even scenes between Lois Lane and Superman were so serious, one would think each scene was the last time each of them would ever see each other again. It was like DC was taking the exact opposite approach Marvel was taking just so they could say they weren't following in Marvel's footsteps, even tho Marvel really handed DC (or any other comic company for that matter) the perfect blueprint for super hero films. <br/><br/>I did have a bit more hope with Wonder Woman, and even for Justice League, based on the previews as both previews showed lighthearted moments and even a little bit of humor. And it winds up, at least in Wonder Woman's case, those previews were definitely a good indication of the kind of film it was going to be as Wonder Woman has those elements that were so lacking in the previous DCEU films and it winds up being the best DCEU film to date as a result. The pacing is one of the best aspects of this film. The beginning basically focuses on the origin of Diana and the events that ultimately lead to her decision to leave Themyscira. This part of the film is handled extremely well as it gives you all the information you need, gives you a great glimpse of Themyscira and it shows just how deadly and talented the Amazons really are as warriors. And this part of the film doesn't drag at all. Its really a brilliant opening for the film. <br/><br/>The thing I was most impressed with is actually Gal Gadot's performance. She did an absolutely amazing job with this part. If I had to rank all of the super hero's from both the MCU and DCEU, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman would rank #3 for me, only behind Robert Downy Jr's Iron Man and Chris Evans Captain America. Going into this film, I really didn't know that Gal Gadot had this level of acting ability in her. Not only was she up to the task physically, but she also brought an emotional element to Diana that really raised this film to a completely different level. In particular, her facial expressions in many scenes really were brilliant. While this film had a great script, was directed amazingly well, had fantastic supporting characters, and had fantastic cinematography and well choreographed action scenes, it was ultimately Gal Gadot's performance as Wonder Woman that really made this film so amazing. There is a child like wonder to Diana as she learns of the outside world and its in these scenes that Gal really shines. For example, there is a scene where Diana sees snow for the first time and she has a child like amazement at its beauty. These kinds of scenes between characters are desperately needed to help break up the more serious scenes and action scenes and it was these kinds of scenes that were so lacking in DC's previous DCEU entries.If you were to reedit this film and got rid of all these kinds of scenes, so it was more like the previous DC films in regards to its level of seriousness, this film wouldn't have been anywhere near as good as it wound up being. Hopefully DC recognizes this now and this approach is used in all of DC's upcoming DCEU films.<br/><br/>Its pretty amazing that it took as long as it did to finally get a solo Wonder Woman film up on the screen, but it winds up that it was well worth the wait. Not only is Wonder Woman the best DCEU film to date, but one of the best all around super hero films made to date. Gal Gadot is absolutely perfect as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She has the beauty, the physicality, and most importantly the heart that makes Wonder Woman who she is. I honestly cant give this film a higher recommendation, both for comic book fans and just movie fans alike. Just a brilliant job by everyone involved and it finally gives DC a much needed success with the DCEU. I now anxiously look forward to any DCEU film that has Wonder Woman in it.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Having just left the movie theater, my thoughts are a jumble. But overall I'm left with this wonderful feeling about what I just saw. I honestly have no criticism. I loved the character'a journey from innocence to knowledge. I loved the action sequences. The story made sense. The characters were like-able. And the important ones weren't forgettable! And that plot twist! I did not expect the Aries reveal! Nor for all the real-ish war depiction. She's a woman who's not afraid to kill and kick ass. <br/><br/>Well, my only critique is regarding the last fight and the villains. How did literally only a handful of people notice the freaking GOD fight happening feet away?! Also the villains in general weren't given much backstory or development. Like the Dr. Poison. Who was she and what were her motivations? But I am willing to let that go as the rest of the plot and movie seemed well put together and I'm hoping for future appearances in the future. <br/><br/>Overall, great movie. Loved this incarnation of Wonder Woman. Can't wait to see more."
"nimdude","5","5","15","31 May 2017"," Pretty good DC movie, pretty average movie
","I didn't have expectations for this movie walking into it. I did see the 96% score on RT but it didn't make a difference because I was fairly sure it was the whole ""feminism"" thing that propelled the score. There is no way this movie was going to be better than movies like Shawshank or La La Land or any high rated Marvel movie. In short it isn't but its a fairly competent movie. My biggest problem with the movie is the ""formulaicness"" of it. It seems like it is just following the superhero movie formula. Especially the way the third act was realized. My second biggest problem is the huge miscast of the villain (not the general but the other one). The actor that plays him (who I will not mention cause it's a spoiler) is great in general but he didn't fit this role at all. Some jokes that are completely directed towards men are a bit forced. Some are pretty funny though. Some of the action scenes were overflowing with slow motion which is epic and grand for the first 10 seconds but then it becomes too much and it stops being a film technique and starts being a gimmick. There are quite a few action scenes that felt a bit wonky in the choreography area and cgi area. There are moments in this movie that I can only describe as cheesy. I hate the word when it comes to film but it really works here. In general the flaws make this movie a flick and it would be a bad one if it weren't for the good qualities. Gal Gadot is great. I liked her portrayal even though she is in no way revolutionary, she can fall flat sometimes in the film when it comes to facial expressions and conveying emotion. In my opinion Chris Pine steals the show when it comes to character arc and acting. His character was the funniest and most charming in the film and maybe in all of dc's films. There is a decision that the writers decided to make for Pines character at the very end of the movie that delighted me because it doesn't usually happen in these types of superhero movies. Or even movies in general as a matter of fact. Good on them. Bremner, Taghmaoui and Rock play sidekicks to Pine's character and all of them did their job well. The main villain was fine and so was the other one. The story was fine, the action was mostly fine, the cinematography was a bit more than fine, the effects were mostly fine and the acting was great. There are more fines than greats in this movie so that's why I'm giving it a lower rating than others. Mainly because this film is just competent. Not brilliant.<br/><br/>6.8/10"

"Shiryu05","3","4","11","24 November 2019"," Wrong Actor...so so wrong
","I found it disturbing that Gadot was cast as the ""defender"" of humankind when she not only served, but is proud of serving in the Israeli army (IDF). When Steve was describing the death of innocents, women and children while compelled by the lasso, it was a slap in the face considering that army (IDF) has no compunction about imprisoning and killing innocent men, women and children and a former army member is on screen, talking about her experiences. Her ""naive"" persona, her outrage etc. falls flat for me considering I've seen footage of dying Palestinians that puts any previous war to shame.<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins' decision to cast Gadot (under pressure from higher powers perhaps?) made me cry, as dumb as that sounds.<br/><br/>I can look past the fact that Gadot is skinny as hell (versus WW having the physique of a bodybuilder - think Gal Yates) but the implication that this was the ""best"" Hollywood could find boggles the mind.<br/><br/>3 stars for the appearance by Chris Pine."

"laurenberman","1","4","11","1 April 2018"," Poor Representation of Disability
","The 2017 film Wonder Woman tells the story of DC Comics's female superhero, Diana (Gal Gadot). Diana is an Amazonian warrior that leaves home to help fight WWII and ends up discovering her full powers and true destiny. There has been much debate surrounding whether or not the movie should be lauded or condemned by feminists. Some argue that the film is a ""masterpiece of subversive feminism"" due to its featuring of a gender norm defying, strong female lead while others claim that Diana's objectification is ""a step backwards"".<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the film has received a lot of attention from progressive people who are concerned about norms and stereotypes, the negative portrayal of disability in the film seems to have slipped by them. Few critics in the mainstream media are discussing how the one obviously disabled character in the film is the villain, Doctor Isabel Maru (Elena Anaya) that is nicknamed Doctor Poison. The character has a scarred face that she wears a mask to cover, and these facial differences are supposed to make her worthy of both fear and pity:<br/><br/>""With her primitive facial prosthetic and raspy voice, both due to the horrific scarring one has to assume was a result of her work, she comes off as vulnerable and haunted. However, that vulnerability helps mask the real darkness she hides within.""<br/><br/>DC Comics is using and enforcing the notion that differences are 'horrific' and sources of 'vulnerability'. Unlike many villains that oppose comic book heroes, Dr. Maru does not have a special power and is not only known by a nickname like 'The Green Goblin' or 'Doomsday'. She is just a human, and only her facial scarring sets her apart from the very humans that Diana spends the whole movie trying to save. Dr. Maru is portrayed as disabled to dehumanize her.<br/><br/>This message, that to be disabled is to be evil, is not unique to Wonder Woman. In fact, it is a common pattern in movies. Captain Hook in Peter Pan, Darth Vader in Star Wars, and the evil witch in Snow White are all in some way disabled. These villain's disabilities are supposed to make them seem scarier to the audience.<br/><br/>The ubiquity of this movie trope is a testament to the fact that there is already a common conception that disabilities are something to be feared - it only works because people already believe it. Negative portrayal of disability in film is both a cause and an effect of this stereotype, and using the stereotype serves to deepen the pervasive stigma surrounding disability.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the film, Diana is faced with the option of whether or not to kill Dr. Maru. While she is making this decision, Dr. Maru's mask falls off and her scarred face is revealed. Diana takes pity on Dr. Maru and chooses not to kill her. By showing Dr. Maru's deformed face for the first time, the audience is meant to see her vulnerability and also pity her. Her disability is supposed to define her as helpless, regardless of how evil she was made to seem earlier on. With just one image of a disability, the audience is meant to completely change their perception of the character - yet again, defining the character by her disability.<br/><br/>Movie viewers, especially children, are impressionable. Writer Alaina Leary explains that only showing disabled characters as ""sympathetic and pitiable or villainous and evil"" enforces ""the idea that disabled people don't live full, meaningful lives the same way non-disabled people do"". Children whose interaction with disability may be limited to what they see on a screen will not understand the experiences of people with disabilities, and they will grow up to be adults who further ableist ideas.<br/><br/>People with disabilities are not defined by just their disability, and they are definitely not something to only be feared or pitied. Like anyone else, people with disabilities are to be loved, admired, respected, and more. It is time for some disabled characters that enhance these aspects."

"veinctor","5","4","11","17 October 2017"," So many questions and plot holes!
","I wished for this movie to be great because I like the DC universe. Nice action, nice effects but the story.... If the movie is divided in 3 parts, the beginning the middle and the end, the middle part was good. The other two parts suffer greatly.<br/><br/>I get it, they want to create some kind of new mythology, a powerful origins story. But in the process they create so many problems! Where do I start? Diana as a kid Jumps off a cliff and her mother catches her just because she happened to be there. Would she die otherwise? Why did she jumped anyways? It seemed like something very casual without any seriousness. I have no idea what was the point of that scene.<br/><br/>We don't know what Diana's bracelets are or do... why they repel bullets? Why she needs a shield if she has the bracelets? You don't know how long it takes for Diana to grow up (which in turn would explain why she hasn't grow old since 1945). The director said that Diana is 3000 years old but that doesn't show in the movie at all. Then.. why she grow up anyways, she is made of clay! Well, OK she is not made of clay as it is revealed, but why lie to your daughter for 3000 years? (that would make sense if Ares was Dianas father).<br/><br/>We don't know where the island is... the hero is English, he was fighting Germans and they get to England by boat in a day! The amazons are training for millennia, but they have no traps at the beach for any intruders! The Amazons fight the Germans just because a stranger told them that they are the bad guys. The Amazons are not getting old, so they are immortal? Then why some are older than others? And if they are immortal but they can die.. then what the difference between them and the Gods, who also died? And between immortal Amazons and Gods, why is Diana special? Diana's super powers such as flying, is not explained at all. What are the origins of the lasso? Why the Amazons were isolated on an island if they were destined to bring balance to the world? And how they learn the thousands of different modern languages that they speak if they never left the island in thousands of years? And if they know so many languages, then how come they don't know what Germans are? Why the Amazons hide? Why there are no men in the island? And what her mom said, that ""the more she knows, the faster Ares will find her"" that makes no sense at all. Also, Diana's mom trying to shield her from training made no sense, because in that island everyone learns to fight and Diana's destiny was to kill Ares and that's why she was created. So that was just forced drama and tension between Diana's mom and her sister. And then suddenly Diana's mom goes from one extreme to the other, making Diana to train 10 times more than anyone else. Everyone has an extreme viewpoint in this movie.<br/><br/>How did Ares killed all the Gods? the Greek Gods were dozens, surely someone would notice that someone murders Gods and they would find out who is the killer. If Anything, Ares would be the prime suspect, as opposed to Hestia for example. Most of the other Gods were Ares family and it's not justified why Ares kills his family.<br/><br/>Also, since they are Gods, how come they don't know that Ares is on to something? How come Athena the Goddess of Wisdom didn't know about any of that? Also who makes those rules about ""only Gods can kill Gods""? How did the Gods were created? Nothing of real importance is explained.<br/><br/>Ares had the face of a drunk farmer. No offense to the actor or the drunk farmers, but that was not the face of an epic war-God. It would be redeeming if he had another ""true"" face in his final form, but nah. The Wonder Woman cartoon movie and Xena had much better Ares. A better plot would be Ares convincing Diana that he is a good guy and make her question her beliefs.<br/><br/>Then Ares says that he didn't make men fight, he only provided the weapons, which doesn't make sense because according to Greek myths, Hephaestus made the weapons. Even if Ares only provided the weapons, then his appearance there and killing all the Gods was meaningless! Ares here had no real philosophy and his death didn't change the world at all.<br/><br/>How is it possible for the God of war to lose to a woman that only got out of her island like 5 days ago? That makes him a complete loser. Ares has the power to melt swords, he can teleport, he can telepathically move objects, and yet Diana suddenly has super magical speed and wins. Ares could easily teleport away from that final explosion. The final battle had no stakes either: they were both immortals with superpowers. If Diana died, nothing would change because we are like that even now. If Ares only gives us weapons, then why Diana fights him instead of humanity itself? They only fought only to kill each other.<br/><br/>The message of the movie was pointless. Diana said that love wins all but... she didn't win with love but with force and killing. Every singe one of her battles. The movie would have a better meaning if there was no Ares and human made the wars on their own and Diana could help with that. If anything, blaming a fictional figure for a real war may sound like mocking the people who actually died in that war."

"jppage-867-857706","4","4","11","10 September 2017"," Just average & like most comic movies...predictable
","This review ""Contains Spoilers"", but is vague enough that if you don't know already what will happen in any DC comic or Marvel comic movie you are new to this ""genre"" or have your head buried in the sand. This is Wonder Woman's ""origin story"" which the comic movie crowd like to call these types of movies...how the comic hero came to be...how the hero became a superhero.<br/><br/>Today's comic-movie formula is predictable...we are treated to an early intense and loud action scene in which the superhero's direction develops. More of the story continues interspersed with some less intense action scenes which lead to the final most intense (usually to SAVE THE WORLD) action scenes where, like I mentioned before, if you don't know already the superhero is somehow going to come out on top you are must be very naive. This is particularly true of the ""first"" movie of a possible sequel cycle of three. Three is the magic number today, and I suppose that's become ingrained due to the success of the original Star Wars trilogy. The superhero could die in a third movie because at that point a reboot of the ""series"" is due. If you are in movie two of a series the hero could be left for dead...a cliffhanger to get you to see movie three. So predictable...so boring.<br/><br/>And typical of most comic superhero movies nowadays (which are sequel-led, rebooted and remade at will on a what appears to be a Hollywood production line) the computer generated imagery allows such unrealistic outcomes like the ever popular falling off a steep cliff or tall building, just to catch yourself or be caught by your fingertips or a piece of clothing snagging at the last moment. Cartoonish feats of unrealistic strength are so easily depicted you are soon numb to all of it that you have no connection to the movie or the characters. At least laws of physics or gravity should be followed, but often aren't. The point that needs to be made is computer graphics can be used to add to a real filmed scene, but instead these kinds of movies have become computer generated animations into which human characters are inserted. They are starting with the fake and trying to insert the real. How about start with the real and try very hard to disguise the inserted fake?<br/><br/>Going back specifically to this movie it is barely an above average comic book action movie even by today's standards. As a movie it's below average because being so formulaic it's hard for any real drama to develop. Sure even a great movie has an underlying formula, but if you are drawn into an original or real story, the drama, and/or the characters you are less focused on the predictable formula. <br/><br/>One of the underlying subplots is the vague ""love story"" between Gadot and Chris Pine's character. It was a little confusing because the fact she was Amazonian where no males exist and being ""created from clay"" by Zeus what caused her to ""do it"" with Pine. (There's a real spoiler) As a movie it is somewhat improved from the Batman vs. Superman disaster where Gal Gadot first appeared as Wonder Woman. Probably this opinion is due to not having to watch Henry Cavill's flat depiction of Superman.<br/><br/>But sadly when it comes right down to it, like Tanya Roberts in Beast Master, the best part of this movie is looking at Gal Gadot's body (if you have appreciation for the female body). As far as her and Chris Pine's acting? What's to say...they did their jobs well disappearing into their characters. This is a movie not really of acting, but the actors becoming more or less props in another run of the mill Hollywood comic production line CGI-heavy action movie."

","DC comics lately has not been impressive and only batman alone is keeping it alive. When i saw the trailer of wonder woman, i was amazed , finally something interesting, the start of the movie was so amazing, the story, the plot, the involvements of gods, beautiful chicks fighting, finally some good scenarios as dc comics are notorious for dark backgrounds . Movie started so well i almost forgot i had to pee. After 40 minutes, addition of a world war stupidity to it was pathetic. CGI effects were like that of a child. An intern of graphic designing could have done a better job in these effect. <br/><br/>The god of war, he was a useless character, of all the world with so many available options for this villain, they chose a cripple with useless end. I was so disappointed. Fat secretary, childish acting, crippled plot line, killed the movie since 40th minute and then it kept sucking, only thing had me wait for the god of war and then that happened, i finally realized, DC comics need an upgrade. They have been persistently disappointing in last two years. First that stupid suicide squad and now this mindless freak show, they really need to learn from Stan lee. I am disappointed. I will still give it six due to the chick and her dimples in her cheek and of course first 20 minutes of the movie. Rest i am unable to find any thing good in it. I am sorry DC comics, but you have failed yet again. What a waste of time."
"ajbarm","6","4","11","27 July 2017"," Disappointing
","I basically fell for the raving reviews of most people calling it the best superhero movie to date and other similar adjectives just to find out that, even when the movie as a whole kind of works as a superhero movie, it's parts are severely flawed and disjointed in themselves.<br/><br/>If you can get past the fact that Gal's acting is so one-dimensional at best (she's kinda charming and that's it), the lousy story (including villain, plot devices and even some dialogue) which makes impossible to let you suspend disbelief and the cgi fest which wasn't bad but uncomfortable to watch at times, you might enjoy the movie (which seems to be the case for a lot of people). But if you are looking for something refreshing and different in the genre, this movie is not it and DC (and WB) seem to be very far from understanding the game that Disney is getting away with (even when their movies are not perfect, they are at least good enough in most cases).<br/><br/>Unfortunately with the success of this, they basically are now showcasing wonder woman as the leader of the justice league at least until superman gets back, and even then she might be given a role that will attempt to steal the spotlight.<br/><br/>All in all, this had potential, at least as a black horse of the genre, but the effort was so wasted in mediocre scenarios and lame execution that it just fell too short."

"claudiahoelting","4","4","11","9 July 2017"," Great acting, sloppy plot
","Okay, this does contain spoilers. First of all I have to say that I really like superhero films and I'm totally fine with the CGI blockbuster, action filled, hero worship thing. I'm a bit of a comic nerd as well. But I'm also a history teacher and that doesn't always mix well. Whereas I totally ship Magneto and Professor X influencing the Cuba Crisis or Captain America trying to destroy the fictional(!!) organisation called Hydra, I simply cannot accept Wonderwoman killing General Ludendorff. Why, for sanity's sake couldn't they just make up a fictional general here? One that didn't have a substantial role in events nine years after WW1 ended. And not a single critic seems to be bothered by that! I know it's difficult to keep all the historical facts straight, especially when you're not doing a history documentary, and that's alright to a certain extent. But killing off real people that played important roles later is crossing a line that just shouldn't be crossed. Apart from that I found character development to be lacking depth, which might be remedied by a director's cut, though. Gal Gadot did a really good job with her character, it just seemed that the script didn't allow her more fluent development. Chris Pine is a brilliant actor with a knack for comedic timing and expression and he delivered in this film just as he does in Star Trek, so nothing to criticize about the actors, they were great. But the story was just not good enough for them to really go deep. I was really looking forward to watching this film and it's just a little sad that it doesn't live up to my expectations"
"nonomkay","8","4","11","5 July 2017"," Great film, somewhat lacking supporting cast
","Gal Gadot was just as we imagine a young heroin to be, and Chris Pine played the right balance of bold and caring with ""Ms. Prince"". The action was excellent. The story-line flowed well. My only issue is that I had great difficulty overcoming Danny Hutson's character (General Ludendorff), because he has been so recycled as the villain (i.e. Wolverine Origins, How to lose Friends and Alienate People, etc.) that I feel his performance was very weak, I suppose because of how small the role was. The same could be said of David Thewlis. His part was small yet somehow integral to the film. David Thewlis should have been replaced with a stronger character/actor."

The director really nailed it when it comes to rep up the DC's reputation as well giving the audiences a proper movie to watch It's quite entertaining maybe the last fight scene is just awesome but I don't mind with a heavy CGI (at least they us properly, compare to other DC movie btw) This the movie that I hoped for and can compete with MCU"

","So we bought our tickets and our medium sized popcorn box (usually lasts about 15 minutes in the movie), grabbed the 3D spectacles and sat in the theater to watch Wonder Woman. That's the way to do it. Each genre has its rules and one needs to know a minimum of them before entering the cinema theater or starting to see a movie on TV or on his/her preferred viewing device. When I chose to see a super-heroes comics inspired movie I do not expect a lot of realism or credibility from the story, and these are not the films where I am looking for lessons about life. On the other hand I am ready for fun entertainment, for action and special effects, I hope to see a coherent story with actors performances that make me care about the characters. I do not care about the laws of physics, but I hope there will be some humor and that the good guys will eventually prevail.<br/><br/>Many of the super-heroes movies nowadays do actually carry some cultural background, it's just a different type of culture, and it helps, although it is not mandatory, to know it. 'Wonder Woman' is a character that combines the mythology of comics stories with the other mythology, the ancient Greek one, the one we read about and maybe learned about in school. Invented during WWII, at a time when women were playing an increasing role in supporting the war effort, mostly by undertaking the roles played in economy by the men sent to fight, but not on the first line of the front, the character of princess Diana (yes, this is the name of the character) carries a strong feminist message. The authors of the script and director Patty Jenkins moved the origins of the story to the end of WWI, the war that was supposed to end all wars. By the way, hard to believe that this talented director is at her only second film, and that 14 years passed since her remarkable debut with Monster. They brought the princess from her isolated island somehow hidden in the mist of mythology, in a tentative to really end all wars. We all know that the tentative failed. In the process the hero will learn a few things about men and evils of mankind, will avoid and block a whole arsenal of bullets and bombs and will kick many bad guys to dust.<br/><br/>I enjoyed 'Wonder Woman' because of a few good reasons. The feminism of the message is never dogmatic and almost always impregnated with a dose of self-irony. Gal Gadot who plays the lead role may not be a great actress, but she has the looks, is very well fit physically and typologically for the role. The film is very much the story of her coming to age while learning to understand mankind and fighting on the side of the good guys. She does it with the smile of a teenager on her face and radiates optimism and belief in truth which somehow becomes credible and succeeds to overcome the horrors of the carnage fields of the world war we see on screen. While playing well on the mythology grounds, the story has enough humor to avoid being dry or pathetic and lets us understand we are still in fantasy land. I also liked the special effects, especially in the opening scenes when the Amazons fight the uneven battle with the war machines created by men since they were lost in history. The color palette of the cinematography was well adapted to the different phases of the story, although the 3D spectacles made it (again) too dark - there is something that needs improvement in the technology here. I also liked two of the supporting actors - Chris Pine who succeeded to be the nice guy without being over-sweet (also because of the dose of humor invested in his role), and especially David Thewlis which I have seen previously in Fargo and who develops to be a formidable actor. I liked less the other characters, especially the bad guys, who were, well ... cartoonish. The end of the story was a little disappointing. It looked like one of these epic superheroes endings, but the careful preparation and building that preceded prepared me for something better. It leaves however clearly the path open for the sequels and I will be making reservations when pre-sales tickets become available."
"jameskidac","9","4","11","12 June 2017"," Its a brilliant marketing masterpiece
","I guess this is how they will make movies now. The story is bad, the acting is mediocre, Gadot cannot hold an American accent as well as her blue steel stare and yet it is brilliantly billed as a coming-of-age empowerment story that instantly got everyone to fall in line to support it, especially its central idea of a strong woman. <br/><br/>The most important characteristic of this movie, following Beauty and Ghostbusters is is this the new innovation in making movies? The marketing is now more important than having a good director and it seems to be the way forward but thankfully we have tapes if we want to revel in the glories of the past, where films focused almost to a fault on characters, struggles (flaws), acting, story, props, costumes, music and design."
"lasttimeisaw","7","4","11","11 June 2017"," DC Comics' first critical darling
","Mired in the discouraging dearth of a blockbuster leading by a super-heroine, Hollywood finally dishes up WONDER WOMAN, one of DC Comics' venerable triumvirate, directed by Patty Jenkins, it is a much belated sophomoric feature after her promising debut MONSTER (2003), and a legitimate star-making vehicle for Gal Gadot, who brilliantly incarnates herself in this iconic character with thorough conviction and pizazz. <br/><br/>As a superhero's origin story, inherently the film has no alternative to spare audience the mandatory ex-positional narrative arc of Diana's backstory, she is a deicidal creation conceived by Zeus and Hippolyta (Nielsen), the Queen of the Amazons, to stop Ares, the God of War, from wrecking havoc in planet earth. The advent of a WWI Allied spy Steve Trevor (Pine) disrupts the tranquility of Themyscira, a hidden and empyrean island where resides the kingdom of these all- female Amazonians. After having the first contact with advanced mass-killing weaponry, pitched battlefield and sacrifice, against the will of her mother, Diana resolves to plunge herself into the WWI front, and firmly believes that if she can assassinate the evil German General Erich Ludendorff (Huston), whom she redeems as the reincarnation of Ares, the war will end. Aided by Steve and his allies, Diana gallantly enters into the mankind turmoil, and her faith will be put into test when things fail to turn out as she expected, does mankind really deserve her? An honest-to- goodness script shoots blunt barbs towards our patriarchal society and innate frailties, which emphatically differentiates the film from most its peers with its sobriety of what causes all the mayhem. The turning point also hits the mark when a heroic act viscerally teaches her what love means and why us, the lesser mortals still deserve her protection. What makes the movie click with mass audience is the humble and self-deprecating attitude in its backbone.<br/><br/>On the other side of the coin, WONDER WOMAN is nevertheless, hampered by its comic strip puerility, from a black-or-white characterization to slipshod plot designation, villains are ill-fatedly sidelined to leave more room for catalyzing the improbable cross-species romance, and its comic relief is essentially PG-13 and in shortfall before everything will be duly embroiled with gravitas, pathos and moral conundrum. <br/><br/>Be that as it may, Gal Gadot is indisputably an entrancing Wonder Woman, particularly in the action scenes, where she jumps, dashes, whomps, high-kicks like a genuine warrior choreographed with female-empowering confidence, wet behind her ears sometimes, but ultimately virtuous, courageous, lethal and unyielding. Accordingly, Chris Pine, although pigeonholed in a lesser salient role, breathes an air of endearment into the scene, Pine's personal charisma is a force to be reckoned with in spite of the limit of his potency, which is essential to precipitate the game- changing shift during the crescendo. <br/><br/>From a strategic point, the movie's success bracingly reassures the stuffy studio bosses that audience is heartily welcoming female talents both before and behind the camera, and also substantiates that DC Comics can finally take up the gauntlet from Marvel Universe after many an underperformed juggernaut and at the very least it sparks a possibility that it may interrupt the latter's hyper-prolific monopoly in the market, which is always a good thing for audience looking for diversity and pluralism."
"billychuatan","8","4","11","11 June 2017"," Best DCEU Movie (so far)
","When I notice that Wonder Woman is going to be released on theater this year. I have mixed feelings about it because 3 previous DCEU movie receive many negative reviews and I feel that they are rushing on getting this movie out on the theater. I have no expectation on this film. I only watch the first trailer for Wonder Woman and then done. I didn't watch the rest of the trailer anymore.<br/><br/>But, when I finally watch Wonder Woman. all i can say is... ""You finally nailed it DC"". Wonder Woman is a very very good movie. I love the script. I love the story. I love the color of the film, it's very vibrant. I love the camera work and shot in this film, it's really beautiful. I love this movie also takes time to develop their characters, so we do care about every decision that they are making.<br/><br/>I love almost every character in this movie. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is very good. because she shows that she's not just an amazon with god-like power. but, she also has some vulnerability. We can see that she's been through and we can see how she feels conflicted with her decision. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor is also very good, i love how he interact with Gal Gadot in this film. their chemistry is very good. I like how they both learn about each other's cultures. because they are from a very very different universe. I also like other character like Antiope, Sameer, Charlie, Chief, Etta. They are tiny characters but they can give a big impact to the film and with only small moments we can learn a lot more about them. <br/><br/>The jokes in this film is also handle very well. Seriously, this is film is quite hilarious. What i love about the script is that, we do learn more and sometimes question our way of act as human. Because when Diana (Wonder Woman) ask Steve Trevor about something we would be like ""ohhh.. yeah why did we do that?"". <br/><br/>My favorite part in this film is in the third act where they are resting after and before they fight in a town. Because we learn more things about Charlie, Sameer and Chief and we see what they are dealing with, we learn more about them. <br/><br/>Okay, let's get to the part what I don't like about this film. The villains, how the action was portrayed and the final act of the film. For me, The problem with DCEU right now is they are not good at casting the villain. The villain in this film is the weakest character in this film I think. Because their motives is unclear, although they explained it. Still, it's very weak motive and we don't feel for them. We didn't care a little bit about their motives. <br/><br/>The action of the film is not really bad. But, what I don't like is that there's too many slow motion. Like the other typical Zack Snyder's movie. also, the action sometimes is a little bit too much. Just a little bit. It's not bad. I just don't like it. But I feel some people would be fine with it.<br/><br/>Then, the final act for the film is the second biggest problem of the film after the villain. The final act is where I think the movie falls off a little bit. They start really strong. it's like up up up up up and then they start declining a little bit. The final act is very CGI heavy. They are not bad. The CGI is very good actually. But I just feel it's not necessary and then that's also one shot in the film where it's very random, like very out of place. Like, ""why would she do that?"" and also there's a line in the final act where it's very out of place too. <br/><br/>But, those are my small problems with this movie. Other than that, Wonder Woman is a very good film. I'm very happy with it. Patty Jenkins as the director did a very well job on directing it. I highly recommended this film if you guys haven't watch it. I'm gonna give Wonder Woman 8/10.<br/><br/>I think that's all for my review of Wonder Woman. Thank you for reading this review and please do rate it if you find this review useful and thank you again for spending your time to read my review. I'll see you in the next review."

"The Grand Master","7","4","11","10 June 2017"," Gal Gadot magnificently does well bringing Wonder Woman to life on the big screen.
","We saw a glimpse of what was to come in Batman v Superman (2016) when Gal Gadot appeared as Wonder Woman. Finally after so many years, Wonder Woman has her own movie and Gal Gadot magnificently does well in the titular role.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman starts off by exploring the origins of Diana Prince being born and raised on the island of Themyscira being raised by her mother Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and later undergoing secret training by her Aunty General Antiope (Robin Wright) to become an Amazon Warrior to which Hippolyta forbids at first but later relents. Things change when Diana rescues pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) after he crashes off the coast of Themyscira while trying to escape from the German military. Steve reveals that he is actually a spy and has uncovered a sinister plot by General Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and his chief chemist known as Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya) to develop a bioweapon that is deadlier than mustard gas. Steve wants to put a stop to the deadly bioweapon and Diana, believing that Ares is behind World War I, wants to help Steve.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is a welcome addition to the DC superhero franchise and deserves a well earned spot as one of the best superhero portrayals as Wonder Woman. Not sure what Wonder Woman would have turned out to be like had the plans for a movie came to fruition in the late 1990's and in 2009 with Megan Gale almost earning herself the role however the movie never eventuated.<br/><br/>Chris Pine who is frequently cast in leading man roles does well taking a step back and playing second fiddle as Steve Trevor to Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. He is not a wimp nor is he relying on Wonder Woman all the time, but still wants to prove he can hold his own and lead the charge to prevent the German's deadly plot. The rest of the supporting cast including Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, Danny Huston (a quality villain), Said Taghmaoui and Ewen Bremner (can't do any wrong) also do well in their respective roles.<br/><br/>Director Patty Jenkins does a terrific job bringing Wonder Woman to life. Well known for the crime drama Monster (2003) which netted Charlize Theron an Academy Award for Best Actress, Patty Jenkins also earns the distinction of being the first woman to direct a superhero movie.<br/><br/>The only downside is that it could have done with more action and less time on the backstory. That being said, the movie was far from dull.<br/><br/>After seeing the various trailer of Wonder Woman beforehand, it certainly lived up to the hype. The movie was definitely well worth the experience and I left the cinema very content and fulfilled. Wonder Woman has deserved its popularity with critics and audiences alike, and it looks like it will be one of the most popular movies of 2017. Audiences are sure to see more of Wonder Woman pop up in Justice League in November 2017 and any future sequels down the track. <br/><br/>7/10."

"please_stand_by","7","4","11","9 June 2017"," Exceeding Expectations, but not Perfect
","With the last DC film to come out being Suicide Squad, there was good reason to be concerned about Wonder Woman. Even after the initial wave of positive reviews for it started coming in I was extremely skeptical. With DC having been in a slump of critically unpopular movies and with superhero movie fatigue on the rise, I really thought there was almost no possible way this would be good or be received well. For the most part, I was wrong. That being said, it is by no means perfect. The fact that this movie is being lauded by many critics as some kind of masterpiece is strange. I was reasonably satisfied overall, but let's not get carried away.<br/><br/>First, the good news: The overall premise of Wonder Woman helping to bring about an end to WWI by finding and battling the god of war Ares, is a perfectly straightforward and compelling superhero plot. The characters mostly work well, even if some of the side characters that accompany her later on feel a bit pointless and underused. Tonally this is also substantially lighter fare than the other recent DC films, which are all pretty heavy and dark and grim.<br/><br/>Initially, I doubted Gal Gadot could pull off carrying an entire movie, but once again, I was (mostly) wrong. She embodies the role to the point where she is probably the best part of the movie and carries it with surprising competence. Part of my skepticism came from the fact that she is/was a model whose previous forays into the world of acting have more or less been as eye candy in the mind-numbing Fast and Furious franchise.<br/><br/>Thankfully, her model looks are not used as a cheap device to hijack the movie into the realm of fan service. That said, her looks do help her to believably pull off a character that is essentially a goddess. Her character is also very clearly a warrior, yet she still mostly plays the character as feminine, not as a male proxy. She also plays the character with an innocent earnestness that, along with her looks, help her to stand out like a beacon in the drab, dreary, and miserable setting of WWI era Europe. And even though she may not have the acting chops of a top tier actress (and it shows in a few scenes), her being cast here fits well enough that I would have a hard time seeing anyone else in the role now. Strong casting usually trumps raw acting experience.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes she is in with Chris Pine's character, who she has an appropriately awkward chemistry with, were allowed to be improvised, which sometimes leads to some very clunky interactions. It kind of works with the naiveté of the character, but perhaps a more clever scripted sequence could accomplish the same thing better. I also wasn't a fan of the early sequences of the movie where Diana is growing up and receiving lots of exposition about her homeland and history. It's a beautiful setting and it sets up the rationale for her leaving, but it drags on and the other characters there are mostly uninteresting. Once she leaves, the plot picks up, with a few rocky patches here and there.<br/><br/>The usage of slow motion during action sequences all the way until the ending is excessive, but not to the point where it's overly obnoxious. My thoughts on the ending and the accompanying battle are mixed. It works as a flashy and climactic way to resolve her motivations for entering the war, but it almost becomes a completely different movie at that point. I think this could've been executed differently so it didn't feel as out of place.<br/><br/>One other problem which personally bothers me the most is the body count. Superman, Batman, and now even Wonder Woman all kill tons of people (Marvel is occasionally guilty of this as well). With Wonder Woman it feels especially wrong, since not only is she against the idea of war to begin with, but the German soldiers she is so easily crushing with her incredible strength are to her merely innocent men being manipulated by Ares. Yes, this is a war, but at no point is subdual or allowing surrender even considered after demonstrating her immense power. I understand that an action movie needs action, but action doesn't need to mean killing everybody. The early fight on the beaches of her homeland is also strange, with both sides just immediately deciding to kill the other despite having no idea who they even are. If you were a WWI era German soldier who accidentally sailed up to an unknown island and saw a bunch of women riding horses on the beach wearing ancient Greek looking armor, would you immediately open fire on them? It just doesn't make much sense.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a good movie made better by the fact that it exceeded expectations, but I wouldn't overdo it with the praise. Let's hope DC movies can stay at this level or improve, and maybe Gal Gadot can counterbalance that dark pessimism in the DCEU with some refreshing hopeful optimism."

","Wonder Woman is the latest Superhero movie for the summer and stars Gal Gadot,Chris Pine and Robin Wright and tells the tale of a beautiful princess named Diana, Princess of The Amazons(Gadot)who saves mankind after she saves a pilot/spy named Steve(Pine)who accidentally finds her place. He tells her that her place is in grave danger and so Diana and Steve travel to London to save mankind and also for Diana to track down Zeus who is a powerful warrior who is tracking her down. But who is Zeus and can Diana and Steve save mankind and Diana's home place.<br/><br/>Packed with action sequences,great acting and a stellar cast I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as I dragged my mom and my younger brother with me to see it yesterday. Gal Gadot is terrific as Wonder Woman she is a real feminist as there is a lot of feminist quotes in this film about men and we see Wonder Woman's background in the beginning from her being a baby to being a teenager. She kinda reminds me of Zena the Warrior Princess. Chris Pine was very good as Wonder Woman's love interest I always liked Chris Pine as he is a good actor and not to mention very handsome too. The villain twist though was very well done as I thought one time that the guy that was snuffling the poison in him was the bad guy but nope it was someone else. <br/><br/>I am happy that superhero movies are bringing in more women as super heroes because it was always men that were the heroes and not the women.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Wonder Woman then check it out. <br/><br/>7/10"
"kjell-ahlstrom","8","4","11","1 June 2017"," Great adaption, not perfect
","SPOILERS!!! As an origin story, this movie does the job really well. It borrows much from Marstens original vision, muddles it up a bit with later interpretations and creates its own tale that is very enjoyable to watch. The playful sexual bdsm undertones of Marsten's original vision of Paradise Island has been removed and we are left with a less controversial interpretation where the warrior aspect of the amazons are at front and center for the movie. Even so, the Amazons are reluctant to fight and this is an annoyance for me in the movie. This isn't the people where they fight to see who the strongest of them are, so they can decide who will represent them. This is the people where only one Amazon can be bothered to go to war to do their peoples sacred duty. The movie is then filled with unnecessary small annoyances and inconsistencies that takes away small pieces of the experience. Why would the most agile woman on earth be unable to walk through a revolving door? How did the amazons take out the battleship with their bows? Why would a person who speaks every language use English to guide German speaking citizens to safety? Then there is the issue of emotions. After recently seeing the season finale of Supergirl and the Karamel moment, and recently watching Kara's expression as she in Injustice leaves Krypton, Wonder Woman comes across as emotionally dead in relative terms. I didn't feel the love between Diana and Steve and I wasn't emotionally invested in what happens between them. While Gal Gadot looks the part I wish she had a larger emotional register. Despite the many small grievances I have with the movie it is really entertaining though... Until the end that is. The ending fight is just a horrible power creep that is actually a power sprint. In a few minutes they pretty much go from WW being an amazing sword and board fighter to an omnipotent goddess, completely ruining her character for future movies, destroying the suspension of disbelief. She is full on IDDQD. For all future movies with Wonder Woman we will now have to ask ourselves at every fight, ""Why don't you just do what you did in the ending of the first movie? And we won't have a good answer, because she should never have been allowed to do that in the first place. Amazing movie that should have been reviewed once more before release. 8/10"

","Truly a triumph of casting, writing and directing, this massive superhero enterprise manages to get most things right. Gal Gadot makes a powerful, charismatic titular superhero, with great assist from Chris Pine, perfectly cast here as both foil and romantic interest that never feels reductive for either character. Director Patty Jenkins tackles the project with clear-eyed confidence, including some truly awe-inspiring battle shots that recall the graphic novel roots without pandering to them, while also simultaneously managing to honor Wonder Woman's visual branding without being silly nor straying too far. The movie starts to lag towards the middle but the thunderous and emotionally compelling climax more than makes up for it. While most of the movie's elements come together well (not to mention great support from Ewen Bremner, Said Taghmaoui and the always-compelling Robin Wright, among others), no ""Wonder Woman"" review can be complete without noting Lucy Davis as Pine's assistant Etta, who provides much of the movie's comedic relief without ever becoming one-note or a joke herself."

","Now I'm not known for my love of superhero films, but this got a lot of praise on release... So would it be the film to change my mind about this genre? It is good. It's refreshing to see strong female characters, all the female characters in fact and Gadot is worthy of most of the praise she received. The action sequences are fun, Matrix inspired slamfests and there's few good jokes thrown in that did make me chuckle. It's far too long though, with a storyline that (I know its a superhero fantasy plot) is weak, plodding, often boring, unimaginative and generally crap. The cast is pretty underwhelming, with even the usually relieable Thewlis leaving me with a feeling of disappointing lacklustre. It made a killing at the box office, so of course they're making another one, but I won't be bothering. Superhero films are, for me, still a waste of time, in this case over 2 hours of it!"

"JamesHitchcock","7","2","4","10 April 2018"," One of the better superhero flicks
","Although Wonder Woman is, together with Batman and Superman, one of the most iconic of all comic-book superheroes, she has not featured very much in Hollywood's long-running love-affair with the superhero movie, an affair dating back at least as far as the original Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" from forty years ago. This is surprising, because some much more obscure characters (Electra anyone?) have been dredged up from the Marvel and DC universes and given their own films. Hollywood has even taken to inventing its own superheroes, like Black Scorpion who was a film character first, a television one second and a comic-book one third. <br/><br/>I have heard two possible explanations for the neglect of Wonder Woman. One is that, although she was originally intended as a symbol of female empowerment, her skimpy costume has made her more of a male fantasy-figure, and film-makers have been afraid that they will be accused of sexism if they allow her to keep that costume and of political over-correctness if she is forced to exchange it for something less revealing. The other is that the character is too closely associated in the public's mind with Lynda Carter from the seventies TV series for them to accept any other actress in the role. In ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" from 2016, however, she was given a supporting role, and now she takes centre stage. <br/><br/>Superheroes fall into three categories. There are those like Batman who have no actual superpowers and rely upon a combination of athleticism and hi-tech devices. There are those like Spiderman and the Hulk who are born normal humans but acquire their powers by accident. And then there are those who possess superhuman powers because they are not actually human, like Superman who is an alien from the planet Krypton. Wonder Woman falls into this last category. She is an Amazon, one of a race of demi-goddesses created by Zeus to defend the world against the evil war-god Ares. (This is a version of Greek mythology which might have been unfamiliar to the Ancient Greeks, who generally regarded the Amazons either as mortal women or as daughters of Ares). Among the Amazons Wonder Woman goes by the Latin name Diana whereas all the others have Greek ones. Some might claim this as a goof, but this was her name in the original comic strip, and the film-makers doubtless wanted to respect tradition. In any case ""Diana"" is more familiar to English speakers and easier to pronounce than the likes of ""Hippolyta"", ""Antiope"" or ""Melanippe"". <br/><br/>The story is set in late 1918, during the closing days of World War One. If Zeus charged the Amazons with watching over the world they seem to have been asleep on their watch because, isolated on their hidden island of Themyscira, they have been blissfully unaware of the war raging in the rest of the world until Steve Trevor, an American spy, crashes a stolen German aircraft on their shores. When Diana, as Wonder Woman is known on Themiscyra, learns from Steve about this dreadful conflict she leaves her home to try and end it and to thwart the machinations of Ares. At first it seems that Diana's task will not be too difficult because the German General Staff, convinced that the military situation is hopeless, have persuaded the Kaiser to sue for peace. The fly in the ointment, however, is General Ludendorff who believes that the war can still be won with the aid of a new type of poison gas invented by a brilliant but evil female scientist. (This plotline may owe something to the sixties movie ""Fraulein Doktor""). <br/><br/>I must admit that I deliberately missed this film when it was shown in cinemas, largely because I had less-than-fond memories of the aforementioned TV series. Carter was undoubtedly one of the most beautiful young actresses of the seventies, but her talent did not match her beauty, and her fellow cast members were no better; I was surprised when Debra Winger, who played Carter's equally scantily clad little sister, later emerged as a successful, gifted and rather serious Hollywood actress. The plots, whether Wonder Woman was helping the Allies defeat the Nazis or assisting with law enforcement in contemporary America, were dull and predictable. <br/><br/>Fortunately, the film is a lot better than its television predecessor. The statuesque Gal Gadot not only has the looks needed for the title role but also has the acting skills to go with them. There is another good performance from Chris Pine as Steve, initially a rather cocky, headstrong young man, but one who proves himself capable of courage and self-sacrifice. <br/><br/>The relocation of the story from the 1940s to 1918 caused some controversy, but I felt it was the right idea. Wonder Woman in World War Two was always going to be a warrior in a partisan cause, fighting for our side (good) against their side (evil). Here Gadot plays her as a fighter for peace, someone who is not only strong and courageous but also loving and compassionate. Her enemies are not the Germans, but anyone of any nationality who rejects peace and seeks to prolong the conflict, and this characterisation gives the story a greater moral depth and power than would have been possible with a simple goodies-against-baddies storyline. This depth is emphasised by director Patty Jenkins, who gives the film a surprisingly dark and sombre visual tone, about as far from the cartoonish look of the television series as you can get. Superhero flicks have not always been my favourite film genre, but this is one of the better ones of recent years. 7/10<br/><br/>A goof. The idea of producing a new poison gas by replacing the sulphur in mustard gas with hydrogen just would not work, scientifically speaking."

"classicsoncall","7","2","4","11 February 2018"," ""...your wrath upon this world is over.""
","It must be I'm becoming jaded watching super-hero movies because this film, given all the hype, left me mostly unimpressed. Sure it had colorful costumes and action galore, but don't they all? The film worked better for me as an origin story for Wonder Woman, but not so much when it moved to the World War I setting. With what's going on in the DC Comic movie universe, I thought the action would have been better placed in the present day. Gal Gadot does cut an impressive figure as Wonder Woman, but surprisingly, she seemed out of her league with the other female warriors on Themyiscira doing battle with the Germans. Maybe it was her youthful appearance beside Robin Wright's Antiope and Connie Nielsen's Hippolyta. The other distracting thing that kept intruding on my thoughts was how does a guy like Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis) manage his role as a leader of the Allies while at the same time commanding the enemy as Ares, the God of War? You would think he'd be missed by one side or the other during strategic missions. Anyway, the picture left me with virtually no feelings about it at all when it was over, and that's not a good thing for building and extending a franchise. I'm glad I stuck around for the end credits though, or I would not have come across the name of the actor who portrayed The Chief. It was Eugene Brave Rock - how cool a name is that?"

This struggle is so much more relatable than watching Superman try to beat up another strongman who is going to enslave humanity.<br/><br/>Diana empathizes with dying soldier's and comes to the rescue of small villages instead of flying past dying civilians and toppling building by throwing bad guys into them.

","Patty Jenkins's 'Wonder Woman' is a decent film. It has the disadvantage of being associated with the other films of the DCEU, and that is a shame since the film is quite excellent, there's actually a story that keeps you interested. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman varies between good character to confusing character, but Gadot makes the character her own and by the end of the film you will not be able to see anyone as Wonder Woman but Gadot. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor made the film feel grounded and gave a lot of heart to it, watching him and Gadot have scenes where its just banter and is probably improvised make the movie great. The music is alright and fits the standard for okay superhero movie music, not relying 100% on ZImmer and JunkieXL's music only when it needs to, and that makes it great, showing that they won't rely simply off of ""badass"" music. The villain and the big twist towards the end is very weak and makes for an awful final fight similar to the doomsday fight in 'Dawn of Justice'. The final fight and the special effects are what bring this movie down. The special effects in this film are awful, obvious green screen during combat and reused shots of Gadot leaping in the air. The cgi is awful and very noticeable. The big ""twist"" is equivalent to picking the background character as the villain. Of course you would be shocked but the film never even hinted at it and the final villain could've been anyone. This film presents an excellent female lead for young children to look up to, and is a very inspirational film with a lot of heart. The film overall is fun and a step in the right direction for DC."
"tabuno","7","0","0","11 January 2019"," Nice Gender Try But Something Is Still Missing
","3 June 2017. It's not easy to grasp the significance of a female director overseeing a female superhero movie based on a male written script. The use of culture clashing humor, the attempts at a female perspective of violence on an epic scale may not be sufficient to draw out the substantive and substantial gender distinction that one finds in the more intimate and relatable relational importance as one might find in Jennifer Garner's presentation, more human and vulnerable, but more emotive and compelling experience in the highly under-rated Elektra (2005). Operating on a smaller and personal scale using an even more powerful human/supernatural theme, its pacing and intimacy easily rivals Wonder Woman's blockbuster special effects bluster. Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft in Tomb Raider (2001) offers up a much more female perspective on violence oriented movies while even Uma Thurman's coming of new age in Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004) captures the more demanding mental infusion of mind and body that is missing in Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>While perhaps the male critics and the women audience members might enjoy the shift in superhero focus, overall, this movie doesn't quite break the bright line of the summer action testosterone action figure blockbuster theme and performance that many suggest it does. Even with the 3-D, the technical quality still hasn't achieved that reality-based visual impact that 3-D potential offers. Hugo (2011) and its 3-D from six years ago still holds up better. Maybe the likely Wonder Woman stand-alone sequel that this initial origin movie justifies will bring a more starkly dramatic and comic fantasy franchise with an emphasis on intimate emotive values such as seen on television like The Magicians (2015-2017) offers."

","When you strip away the feminism and don't feel like superhero movies are a must watch. This turns into a decently entertaining action movie. It suffers from cliché and lazy writing, the CG is mediocre for a superhero movie, it often gets the typical marvel treatment, where nothing seems to have the right weight and the effects just isn't on the same wave length as the acting. It makes some moment ment to be very powerful, just look silly. But don't get me wrong, there is funny moments, bad ass action sequences and absolutely no substance. I'm glad to see women getting more attention as action hero, but this shouldn't be a get out of jail free card for the entire movie. We need more diversity in movies, but we can't start mercy liking. We can't call bland run of the mill superhero movies for masterpieces, because the lead doesn't have male genitalia. But if you're looking for some brainless entertainment, this is definetly fine.

","""Wonder Woman"" is an action fantasy movie in which we watch a woman who is the princess of the Amazons, trained to be the best and strongest warrior. She is raised on an isolated island and when a pilot crashes on their land, everything chases and she leaves her home in order to help this pilot to stop the war. She will also try to find her destiny and discover her true powers and limits.<br/><br/>In general, I have to say that my expectations were very low before watching this film because of ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" which was very boring so, I was happily surprised when ""Wonder Woman"" was not a bad movie. It has plenty of action, it's an interesting movie with a well-written plot which makes the movie more interesting. In my opinion, it's the best DC movie until now but DC has room for improvement in order to just be compared with Marvel not surpass it because I find it extremely difficult. I liked the interpretation of Gal Gadot who played as Diana and Chris Pine who played as Steve Trevor. Despite that, I have to mention a moment in the movie that I didn't like and I will put it as a general term that would be good for movies with superheroes to be considered before the direction of it. When there is a reveal of a character and there is also a soundtrack behind this, it would be good if the combination of both is or happens the same time and especially in the correct moment in the movie.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to admit that ""Wonder Woman"" is a good and interesting movie for everyone to watch and I strongly recommend it. If you hesitate of watching it because of the previous movies of DC like the ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" then I advise you to reconsider your opinion and watch this movie."

I ignored all annoying backslashes the movie was getting from fanboys, haters, nerds and anti-Israelis.<br/><br/>The movie had everything going so well: the cast, everyone was amazing with the acting, flawless. Props, costumes and settings were top notch. I don't know how they built the old England but was it believable and amazing! I love Wonder Woman's costume so much.<br/><br/>It had some comedy to it which were really nice.<br/><br/>The story was the biggest gripe for me, I was quite surprised they put a lot of back story to Diana when she was little. But things just went down hill after she kissed the guy. Everything became a messed and it felt like the movie makers ran out of ideas, had budget restrains and just didn't know what to do so they rushed it.<br/><br/>One thing I liked about Diana is her naive personality.<br/><br/>So far the best DC movie which I approve is Suicide Squad. Every other DC Movies had not impressed me yet and I was hoping this movie would, but sadly DC missed the mark.<br/><br/>The thing about Marvel's movie adaptations is that they aim the movie towards people who are aware of who the comic character is. But the story is freshened out for people who are not comic book readers nor do not know about a comic character. And for the hardcore fans of the character who are deep in knowledge with the character's story and universe. Marvel will add little nuggets, clues and cameos in the movie.<br/><br/>However this movie just missed the mark. The movie was just aimed at people who don't know anything about Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Also anyone seen God of War Ares use thunder has his powers? shouldn't that be Zeus? also how could Diana be created if Zeus gave his life to create shield for Namascrara?<br/><br/>One thing I hated about Wonder Woman is she keeps clapping her wrist together, that thing is so annoying! It is meant to reflect bullets and projectiles but why does she use it as a special attack???<br/><br/>R0ttenT0mato obviously gave a false review ratings because of the backslash the movie was getting.<br/><br/>Zack Synder wrote the movie, and after 1hr of the movie, the story just turned to mess. I don't think i will be watching Justice League because I was disappointed with this movie!<br/><br/>Captain American First Avenger sucked, but Winter Soldier was too freaking amazing!

","OK so it's a superhero film so allowances need to be made for silliness, but even by the internal logic of the film there are some glaring errors.<br/><br/>First a big part of the story is the danger presented by a new kind of gas which can melt gas masks and kill any one who comes in to contact with it. Later in the movie several characters come in to contact with the gas, have a few coughs, then just carry on like it was a mild annoyance.<br/><br/>Second, during a big battle scene in a Belgian town, Wonder Woman gets to do her super stuff, jumping 100 metres in the air, throwing tanks etc, does any one bat an eyelid? Nope. The rest of the characters and the rescued villagers don't react at all to this display of super powers. It's as if they think it's completely normal for a woman in hotpants to pick up tanks and throw them around.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this movie is Gal Gadot. She simply can not act. She has all the nuance and depth you would expect from a former beauty queen, or a plank of wood. There is no chemistry between her and Chris Pine, he is a good actor, but he can't make her look good. Gadot has a strong Israeli accent, and it seems in an effort to try and cover this they got the other Amazons to fake some weird hybrid accent so Gadot wouldn't stand out so much. The overall effect is to make all the Amazons to sound ridiculous and it really takes away from the film.<br/><br/>Yet again Warner bros have messed up a superhero film and it doesn't bode well for the upcoming Justice League.

","Maybe to all the ignorant DC fanboys this was a great movie, but I hated it. First of all the Greek Mythology was so incorrect it hurt. First of all the Amazones are daughters of Ares. The Amazones' purpose wasn't to save the world, if anything their main concern of life was war. Second of all Diana is the Roman version of the Goddess of Hunt and the Moon. And she has nothing to do with the Amazones, the only correct thing about Diana is that she is a daughter of Zeus.<br/><br/>The Ares went rogue thingy: It doesn't make sense, if there would be one God who would want to overthrow the rule of the Gods it would be Hades. Also Ares didn't hate the humans, he loved them. Humans even worshiped him, and prayed to him whenever they went to war. oh also: GODS CANNOT DIE. Did you know that Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, Hera and Demeter spent their first years of life in the stomach of their father Cronos. Finally, Since when does Ares look like an English little prick and not like a blond firm Greek God?"

","About the actor playing Wonder Woman is some controversy being a former IDF soldier and zionazi praising the Gaza massacre. So I was not easily won over, but her appearance is great and she really shines. But she can not save the movie, which has too plain a story, non engaging characters - and the whole thing has a taste of cheap propaganda. US American propaganda that is. The US soldiers are fighting the good fight against evil Nazis, the bullets are flying, explosions everywhere and our American super woman is leading from the front taking all the heat reflecting it with her superpowers. << be a superhero too - join the army >> .. and forget, that the US is acting today like the Nazis did in the 30th. A Israeli superzionazi heroin is just what is needed making it to work. <br/><br/>The CGi is unrealistic, the story shallow and is a nice enough film for 10 year old kids with the bonus of a female superhero. If you did not had a lobotomy stay away or fast forward the cheesy dialogues - plenty of them - and enjoy the few action scenes with poor CGI.<br/><br/>Her infight scenes are not exactly martial art but rely too heavy on CGI <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the first minutes though, when superwoman as a kid wanted to learn fighting, the rest I think not."

","Seriously, am I just an absolute idiot or is everybody raving about it simply because it's the first superhero movie with a woman in the lead role? Don't get me wrong I don't mind that fact at all, it's just I don't get why this movie is getting praised so hard at all!<br/><br/>The good stuff right here: Gal Gadot is great as Wonder Woman. She is likable, heroic and even funny when she needs to be. I also like Chris Pine's character, he was a charming fellow. The romance between the two also really worked well for the film. It felt way better paced than most of the romances in these superhero movies. Furthermore, I think most of the humor in the movie worked well too! It's got that fish out of water element and manages to keep it funny despite the fact that we've seen it all before. <br/><br/>Just about everything aside from this was either average or outright awful. The whole plot about stopping World War 1, and something about some German super weapon, was so boring it nearly put me to sleep during the expository scenes. Add to this a pair of comically bad villains including a German officer and a painfully underdeveloped female scientist and you've got a plot that is as dull and predictable as it is unoriginal. <br/><br/>And for the love of God, who is in charge of these VFX!? They look absolutely horrible! There's seriously not a single CGI shot in this movie that doesn't stick out like a sore-thumb. This problem was particularly bad during the final fight scene, which made me feel like I was watching one of the Matrix sequels or something.<br/><br/>The action is directed with some serious lack of taste too. The angles are hard to make out at times and the choppy editing goes by way too quickly. There's also a lot of that stupid slow-fast-mo crap where they keep switching in and out of slow motion. It made me feel like I was watching 300, which is weird because this movie actually WASN'T directed by Zack Snyder. <br/><br/>So seriously I really don't get it. Is it a competent film with decent characters and a beginning, middle and an end? Yes, but is that really all it takes? Just because the past DC movies have been awful they get a pass immediately when they make a somewhat watchable film? I'm seriously just baffled and confused here. I dunno, hard to recommend this one very strongly. An improvement for sure, but still very far from grace..."
"TheBestBork","5","5","16","3 June 2017"," A Step Forward For The DCEU
","Considering the quality of other DCEU films like Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad, I think I was justified in being skeptical before seeing this movie. I came into this movie expecting the worst, but I was definitely surprised. Is Wonder Woman one of the best superhero movies ever made? No way. But I do think this is the best DC movie since The Dark Knight Rises (which I know isn't saying much), and I think I have a tiny bit more faith in upcoming DC movies now.<br/><br/>I'll start off with my biggest complaints. Everything that happens until Wonder Woman and Steve leave the island is terrible...it's full of bad acting, clichés, and awful CGI. This movie can be so cheesy and so cliché sometimes, and it's not self aware of it. Some scenes that are meant to be dramatic come off as laughable. The movie's tone is very inconsistent, and again, it's unaware. There's some pretty bad green scene too. Most characters besides Wonder Woman and Steve are either uninteresting and/or annoying. The soundtrack can also be repetitive. This movie also has like three villains for some reason, the main one being so underdeveloped and forgettable. Some elements of the story are very predictable too, and the climax of the movie is so horrendously awful. From the cringe-worthy one liners to the goofy effects, I was just waiting for the movie to end from that point. Basically when the main villain is introduced (which is like 20 minutes before the end of the movie) the movie becomes 10 times worse.<br/><br/>I don't want the cons to turn you off though, because I'd still recommend this to action/superhero movie fans. There's actually a lot of good humor in this movie that's a refreshing take from the previous entries in this universe. This movie felt like a breed between the first Captain America movie and the first Thor movie, although I like Wonder Woman better than both of those. The action in this movie is also pretty intense and riveting, minus the climax. The movie really nails the WWI setting as well. I liked the banter between Wonder Woman and Steve too, the chemistry between them was there. I was unsure if Gal Gadot was a good Wonder Woman when I saw her in BvS, but I now see that she's a great choice. She's very funny and charming, and not a wooden, thrown-in prop like she is in BvS.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go into this movie expecting a 10/10 rating, because this movie has a lot of flaws. The 96% you're seeing on Rotten Tomatoes and other critic sites are a lie. If you can suspend your disbelief for a bit and accept it for a cheesy superhero movie, then you'll like it. I enjoyed it so much more than the previous entries in this universe that it gives me a small bit of hope in the future of DC, even though we deserve better than this."

","This movie should be in everyone's library! Patty Jenkins brought the amazon princess to life!!!<br/><br/>The movie starts in present day (after the events of BvS:Dawn of Justice). Diana receives a picture from Bruce Wayne (the photo was seen in BvS), and begins to reminisce about what led to that photo of her being taken during WWI (yes,, the first world war).<br/><br/>Diana was raised on Themyscira, Island of the Amazons. Her mother, Hippolyta, ruled the Amazons as queen. As Diana grows up, she is trained to be a warrior, as all the Amazons are.<br/><br/>Themyscira is hidden from the outside world, but like all things hidden, it cannot stay that way forever. One day, while admiring the ocean view, Diana sees a small engine plane crash not far from their shore. Without hesitation, Diana dives into water and rescues the pilot from drowning. The pilot's name is Steve Trevor,, and he's an American working as a spy for British Intelligence in WWI,, and he's being closely pursued by the German forces,,,<br/><br/>
I've been reading a lot of the reviews that say this movie is boring, and that Gal Gadot's acting was terrible,,, I don't know what movie they were watching or what they were expecting. (I'll agree there was one or two moments that I thought could've been acted better,, but then again I remembered that the character Diana has led a pretty sheltered life. Maybe Jenkins and Gadot were playing into that part of the character,, idk) I thought the movie was excellent all around! Gal Gadot is Diana Prince imo. She just looks exactly like what you'd imagine Wonder Woman would look like,, and I thought she portrayed her very well. The rest of the cast was great as well, including Pine, Houston, and Thewlis especially. I especially enjoyed the recreation of WWI and the creation of Themyscira (loved the Amazon warriors!!!).

"fernandoschiavi","8","4","12","3 May 2020"," It is full of light, color, heart and a cohesive history, characteristics that make it one of the best of its kind in recent times
","With the proper introduction of the Man of Steel, with the new older summer of Batman and the anti-heroes who are part of the Suicide Squad, we can finally enjoy a movie of Wonder Woman, the most powerful heroine in the DC universe. After being introduced to the general public in cinemas in ""Batman vc Superman"" that already gave us a very good idea of who the character was and what she was capable of doing and now, the wait is finally over. To bring this super powerful woman to the screen, she was called Patty Jenkins, who does not have as many jobs on her resume, but who became known worldwide for directing Monster (2003) that gave the Oscar for Best Actress to Charlize Theron for playing Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who becomes the first serial killer woman in history.
One of the great strengths of the production is the script by Allan Heinberg - egress from TV series like ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Sex and The City"" - which builds a script with many merits, respecting the origin story of Wonder Woman bringing to it highlights several other aspects. Setting the plot at the end of the First World War, the script manages to present aspects of the behavior and customs of society from the beginning of the 20th century, and issues related to the power of those who are in charge of nations, political decisions, all still permeated with gods and legends. mythological, as well as dilemmas of whether or not humanity deserves to be protected by the Amazon.
The film begins today, after the events of 'Batman v Superman - Origin of Justice', and shows Diana Prince, who works in the Antiques Department of the Louvre, receiving a World War I photograph from his mail sent by Wayne Enterprises, when you start to remember your past. So we are transported to the beginning of the 20th century, when we see little Diana, who has always wanted to train with the other Azones, but who was prevented by her mother Hippolyta, who hid her father's identity from Diana, thought she you shouldn't worry about that in times and peace and that you should play like a child and not fight. Over time, Hippolyta is convinced by Antiope and Diana then starts to train more than any other Amazon. When pilot Steve Trevor crashes on his plane and is rescued by Diana, all Amazons learn about the dangers that surround the isolated Paradise Island in the world of men.
These first forty minutes of the plot are dedicated to telling Diana's childhood, showing how life is on Paradise Island, and better setting the viewer in Greek-Roman legends. With Diana's departure with Steve, it is interesting to note Diana's still naive gaze on humanity, especially in a time of war. The contrast of this naivete in her eyes with that of the experienced pilot and spy Steve is when we realize that she was there embarking on a transformative journey towards London where her beliefs would be confronted. In fact, arriving in the English capital, more aspects of this naivety in relation to the customs of society are understandable and a highlight of the film alongside Etta Candy (Lucy Davis), Steve's secretary. While Diana was born and raised trained to be a warrior, she does not understand the use of dresses, fashion, etc. Even going through a revolving door in your new outfits and a sword becomes a hilarious challenge and trying ice cream for the first time becomes a unique experience. There is also time to be impressed by man-made weapons to kill people. Even the struggle for the right to vote - which would only be won years later - is cited as a criticism of society at the time. The same criticism used later when Diana enters a military audience where only men are allowed. And what about Diana confronting the coldness of political decision and calling the general a coward for allowing soldiers to die on the front lines of battles? Just what we expect from the character. The best of ""Wonder Woman"" is due to this meeting of two peoples: Diana's, composed only by women; and ours, where women had (still have) fewer rights and opportunities than men. The script is fanciful in scenes where the current machismo is ridiculed with pleasure by the protagonist.
The script uses the entire first half of the plot to insert Diana into the world of men and develops the character in a slow, careful and skillful way. And from the final half, Diana is able to show her skills to humans, with special emphasis on the scenes when the team reaches the Western Front in Belgium, they are interrupted by enemy machine guns, but Diana leaves alone in the middle of no-man's-land and gathers allied forces behind it to free the village of Veld. The scenes of Diana appearing behind the barricades and facing the enemy soldiers is epic, as well as the scenes in which she invades through the windows the places where she faces

The scenes of Diana appearing behind the barricades and facing the enemy soldiers is epic, as well as the scenes in which she invades through the windows the places where she faces several German soldiers to the sound of the heroine's theme song. In the final stretch, there are also the excellent action sequences with Diana's fight with Ludendorff and, especially afterwards, against another unexpected villain amidst many destructions, shots and explosions.
One of the highlights of the film is the relationship between Diana and Steve and that was essential for the film to work. Since Diana rescued him from the sea, we have noticed a sexual tension between them. The complicity between the two only grows over the two hours of projection and makes us cheer for the couple at all times. The chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine is evident and the scene in which he teaches her to dance under the snow and then go to the bedroom and surrender to the love they feel for each other is the culmination of the couple's relationship building. It is in Steve that she knows love and better understands the human action. Humanity's decision is the cause of war and violence, but humanity is also much more than that. It is a humanity capable of loving and that deserves another opportunity. It is also worth highlighting the duo that leave with Diana and Steve to destroy another arms factory together with Ludendorff and Maru. Spy Sameer (Saïd Taghmaoui), excellent sniper Charlie (Ewen Bremner).
If most of the film builds an exciting film in both visual and narrative, the ending, despite having twists and turns, cannot escape much of the concept of elevating action at the expense of coherence. They are minutes of much noise for nothing, without any direct contribution to the lesson that the heroine needed to learn about humanity. These are moments when the director changes the retro look and uses more practical effects for a more obscure and full of green screen effects.
The production of the film also deserves all the praise. Production designer Aline Bonetto, photography by Matthew Jensen are incredible in perfectly setting the time of the First World War in both sets and costumes. It is a war movie with the presence of a superhero, making everything more real and believable even with all the fantastical aspects that involve the origin of the heroine. The soundtrack by Rupert Gregson-Williams is sensational. The composer mixes action themes very well, using the character's theme music very well in moments when he detonates his enemies and also several stretches of pure emotion in the midst of the climate of war. In the post-credits we still have the Australian singer Sia, who wrote a song for the film, entitled ""To Be Human"", with the English musician Labrinth, who is also on the soundtrack.
'Wonder Woman' is a film with excellent production, with a first script and that works thanks to the direction of Patty Jenkins and the scenic presence of Gal Gadot. The choice of the dietician is not only for the symbology of a woman directing a film of a female protagonist in an action film but, consequently, also for being the first woman to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist in Hollywood. Just to abuse the clichés of films of the genre such as slow cameras and camera turns in the beating scenes, the scenarios where these scenes take place end up differentiating the film from so many others of the genre.
The Israeli actress, on the other hand, manages to pass the still naive look of young Diana in the land of men, all her discoveries and dilemmas, which contrast very well with the wiser posture of the character of the first and last scenes of the projection. Diana was very well represented as a normal woman. A woman with very high values, but still a woman. It can be sensitive. She is smart and emotionally independent. She may be confused. She may lose her confidence or not. She's everything. She has a human heart. The actress exudes charisma, easily switching between the sweetness of a young woman discovering a world different from her own and the strength of a warrior who distributes tapas without losing her hairstyle.
'Wonder Woman' is the best film in DC's eccentric extended universe, a work of great quality, quite faithful to its original material, which was a box office success and which will certainly generate new sequences. It is a symbol for women and it came to break barriers and prejudices. It is full of light, color, heart and a cohesive history, characteristics that make it one of the best of its kind in recent times."

Wonder Woman got encouraged to leave the island cuz the guy found her. Wonder Woman got into the war with the guidance of the guy.

The animation or CGI is execellent. It is good to have Steve Trevor there for the romance. The setting is awesome. The slow-motion scene is also great. On the other hand, I have a problem in music in the end while Wonder Woman is fighting Ares. I don't feel the music.

The character has a quest hinging on a romanticized destiny...check, a love interest...check, a nemesis...check, the bad guys have a secret weapon....check. More bewildering is the praise of feminism that has elevated the film to greater acclaim than it deserves. This is nonsense. <br/><br/>The hero is a heroine; that is pretty much it. Gadot has enough conviction to command the screen but she is not a great actress, Fortunately she doesn't need to be. The script doesn't give her much of an inner life. In particular, her romance with Steve Trevor is fairly staged and seldom organic. Her claim to understand the power of human love by the end of the movie is no more earnest than Trump's claim to understanding the problems of America.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is unusual in its structure. It has an enjoyable middle section bookended by a fairy cheesy first and third act. Diana leaves her home in the over green screened Amazon world and enters WWII Europe with Steve Trevor. The film handles her displacement in the real world with some good humour before allowing her to shine on the front lines of the battle. The action scene are fine, although there are a few too many kicks and punches in slow motion. Watching this effect in 21st century cinema is like watching a sporting gear commercial. The climax is disappointing because it is dull. Diana exchanges gimmicky banner with her nemesis Ares while engaging it a relatively lifeless fireball fight.<br/><br/>The movie succeeds in making you want to see more of Gadot in the hope that maybe a sequel will have more imagination in the writing. However, that seems unlikely."

","Wonder Woman - One of the many super hero movies from DC comics and for a change, the super hero is actually a Super Heroine!!! Yes, I accept that one of the reasons I went to watch this movie is for the heroine - Gal Gadot. She was a part of the F&F franchise and I was bit sad that she was taken out from the F&F series, but, glad to hear that she is part of the Justice League!!!<br/><br/>As always, Wonder Woman movie is slated as the origin of Wonder Woman and the only expectation I had is to know how are they going to link this with Justice League. The beginning of the movie provides you the justification and also sets the tone for the journey. The movie is all about a pre-historic event that happened which gave way to the introduction of Wonder Woman. If you had seen Batman Vs Superman:Dawn of Justice, you would be able to relate the sequences.<br/><br/>Coming to the movie, it is an action packed entertainer and as usual filled with logic defying action sequences. However, the choreography of the stunts are amazing, especially, the Slow-Mo in- between the action is very much to be appreciated. Special accolades to the CG work to showcase the kingdom of Themyscira, which was amazing!!! The sequence of explaining the creation of Themyscira is to be appreciated (told by the queen as a bed time story to her daughter) which forms the crux of the daughter's belief and the understanding of Go(o)d vs Evil.<br/><br/>The war sequences (1st World War) is well taken and is visually well planned and executed. The dialogues between Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) and Wonder Woman, in the first half, is filled with great sense of humor. If compared, this is the only super hero movie to have less action sequences. Especially, towards the end, the director could have avoided few dialogue exchanges, which are not required and I saw them as clichéd.<br/><br/>It's is very hard to remember a super hero movie without Danny Huston (General Stryker of Wolverine series) and he does his role to perfection (Gn.Ludendorff). Also, the performance of Patrick Morgan/Ares (David Thewlis) is also respectable and fits aptly.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is a fun filled action entertainer and as always, go with your hands full (with popcorn and beverages) and mind free!!!!"

It's not perfect, but I found it supremely entertaining with a terrific lead actress and a compelling story (up to a point).<br/><br/>Entertaining - For me, the 2+ hours just flew by. From Diana's backstory as a small child growing up on the Island full of Amazons to her first steps off the island to her battles with the Germans, it was pretty much a thrill-a-minute. And I appreciate the fact that the filmmakers decided to inject some humor. My biggest complaint with most of DCs other efforts is the complete lack of anything remotely funny. They're dark and depressing - and as a general rule, dark and depressing do not equal entertaining in my book.<br/><br/>Lead Actress, Gal Gadot - What a woman! As someone who adored Lynda Carter in the Wonder Woman TV series, I'm glad Gadot resembles Carter. It made it easier for me to believe in her performance. And what a performance it was! For someone with a relatively limited acting background, I thought she was magnificent. She held her own acting- wise. Her comedic timing was spot-on. She delivered some of the best deadpan funny lines I've heard in a long time. And her ability to be at least somewhat convincing in the fight scenes was a real plus. She's just amazing!<br/><br/>The Story - I enjoyed most all of the plot. If I have one complaint, it's with the film's ending. The whole god vs god thing at the end just didn't work on me. There was too much CGI and too little storytelling. But, as evidenced by my rating, it wasn't enough to spoil the entire movie for me. I was having way too much fun to let this get in the way. And up to that point, the plot worked for me. I bought the rest of Wonder Woman's story hook, line, and sinker. They made her a believable, real character - something that's hard to do with a superhero. Sure, there were holes and illogical things going on, but as I've repeatedly said, when it's this much fun, who cares?"

And I hope it's just a start and we get to see more of this wonderful character.<br/><br/>The best thing is the response it got and how everyone accepted a woman as a superhero. But that has a lot to do with what woman are doing right now in the world. The work real world woman are doing makes it easier to visualize a female superhero. So this one is for all the woman and the work they are doing."

","Positives: Can't think of any. Negatives: 1. Really bad science such as jumping off a moving horse and landing without a forward momentum. Failed middle school science. Effortless jumps of hundreds or more feet. Would work if we knew what force (other than leg muscles) she utilized, but none given as none exists even in ""Wonderland"". 2. Grade school dialogue with lots of petty arguments amongst the Amazonians which is unworthy of their stature (pun). 3. Lots of middles ages weapons and fighting skills. Why just that period of tech & culture? For a people who live forever you would think they would educate themselves to something a little better, or at least venture into ""man's"" world and borrow a few ideas. Dumb! 4. Since they don't venture into ""man's"" world how and why does each person learn a 100 different languages, to what end. More dumb. 5. Why all the makeup? 6. Why the synthetic Hollywood costume shop plastic looking clothing that never seems to get dirty or torn? 7. Action scenes were stereotypic, non-creative, borrowing of the same moves found in all action flicks. One typical puzzler is while she's being shot at (several hundred rounds/min) by several machine guns she just stands there holding a shield for upper body protection leaving legs exposed yet not a single round strays in that direction. Add in wrist bullet deflectors and the really cheap CGI of electrical zapping and her wonder skills become laughing skills. 8. Acting was moronic & robotic to satisfy middle school audiences willing to accept anything with attractive women. Add in the romantic scenes for money making audience appeal which did nothing to enhance her specialness. 9. Overbearing musical/sound effects give-away and often used to bolster shallow plots in movies. 10. Made a mockery of Greek classical characters. Summary: Very cartoonish level writing, acting, effects."

","The movie has an interesting cast, I only know Chris Pine and Said Taghmaoui by name and those among others did a great job and saved the movie from a more dramatic fail. The choice of Gal Gadot is not a great choice, definitely not what I imagined. His acting lacks talent and convincing. Although the director tries to emphasise her ""cuteness"" but anyone who is actually familiar with the wonder woman character would know it's not about cuteness alone. I think they could have easily found a more convincing Actor for such an iconic character. <br/><br/>About her superpowers now, this part is so messed up, apparently she can be hurt by a bullet but surprisingly survive big explosions. She never actually fought a decent foe before but still can kill the ""God of War"" himself on first try. I mean WOW!<br/><br/>She seem clearly overpowered, the scene when she stops projectiles with her mind was too much. She is like superman, but superman knew very young about his capacities but it took her forever to know she is a ""God""?! C'mon! That's ridiculous. Those poor Nazis had no chance.<br/><br/>I think what makes a good superhero movie is a challenging Villain, it was not the case in this movie. I think this movie tried too much to avoid any controversial critics from feminists. Eitherway, I'm glad I didn't actually pay to watch this movie. I hope her over-powered character doesn't jeopordise the ""justice league"" movie. I had the impression that if someone kick her ass, the movie will be banned or something.<br/><br/>It's still an okay movie if you have nothing else to watch. Chris Pine was very Charismatic and Said Taghmaoui was also an interesting add to the mixte, considering that more than 100 thousand north africans died in France alone. So I see it like a nice tribute to a groupe who was never really recognised as a defining factor in WW2."

","It's sad that so many obviously talented people contributed to this film considering it's so dire. The fact it's made so much money shows that poorly made teenager centric films obviously have a huge audience.<br/><br/>The script is shockingly clichéd and poorly written with many characters that wouldn't be out of place in a below average Video Game ie terrible. Maybe that's intentional as many scenes resemble the cut-scenes in a video game, especially the ""bad guy's"" scenes. That bodes badly for the future of cinema. The acting follows suit.<br/><br/>Surprisingly for the budget, too many effects look fake and cheesy. Even the large city crowds fail to convince it's real.<br/><br/>As for the fight choreography, it's American so expect more edits than punches. Except of course when it's full CGI complete with slow-mo. When will directors and editors learn!<br/><br/>It's not all bad. There are the usual cgi influenced battles, which obviously talented people have worked on. They must however feel disappointed when the see their work in the completed movie.<br/><br/>I love decent action films, unfortunately this isn't close to decent.

","Imagine Superman without kryptonite. Bullets bounce off and tanks are a mere nuisance. God smites him, and he just shrugs it off. This is Wonder Woman the movie, and it's boring.<br/><br/>There's no character development, as Wonder Woman is already perfect (unlike in the comics). Supporting characters don't fare much better, and are as stereotypically one-dimensional as a cardboard cutout. Bad Germans are bad. Even the main villain seems somehow empty, existing just for the final fight in slow-motion before credits roll.<br/><br/>The writing is generally quite sloppy, and the story is filled with insultingly obvious loopholes. Many scenes seem to be glued on only to look cool, and the character's motivations are not clear beyond the general good vs evil.<br/><br/>Visuals rotate between CGI landscapes and power poses during slow- motion ballet fights. Pacing is poor, filled with cuts, and many scenes feel artificially constructed. Instead of feeling impressed I felt like someone was forcing ""cool"" things down my throat.<br/><br/>It's ironic that the role model praised by feminists is that of an impervious pretty girl with no personality. We have strong women leads in many movies (Alien, Terminator 2, Nikita, Avatar, Hunger Games) and series (Buffy, Alias, Game of Thrones, Orphan Black, S.H.I.E.L.D.) - and they're forceful, independent and charismatic, but also flawed and *interesting*."
"DeafFrog","4","4","12","4 September 2017"," Gal Gadot is hot, that's it, the entirety of the good things.
","Disclaimer: I was unable to finish the movie: I got bored.<br/><br/>Like most superhero movies, Wonder Woman takes itself seriously, and fails at it. So, let's start with that: the plot is unnecessarily dark, but stupid, those two things, just don't work together. It's a movie about a daft Amazonian woman that can kick arse with plenty of CGI, and a dark story about how evil the German's were in WW ONE-- where yes, atrocities were committed by BOTH sides, but by no means were generals gassing their entire command structure to kill more people--The plot, as you can see, is an odd mix.<br/><br/>Next, let's talk about Gal Godot's accent: I hate it: it sounds stupid. I get why she has it, that's fine, she has never heard another accent, but yet, we need to suspend our disbelief to the fact that she can speak English: a language she has never heard before; just take it a bit further and get rid of the grating accent. Which leads on nicely to my next point: it's a superhero movie, we're supposed to suspend our disbelief, but Wonder Woman asks for way to much: dramatically changing the way WWI happened. It's fine if a few small things happened differently, but to actually change the course of human history is asking for way too much.<br/><br/>The comedic relief relies only on awkward sex talk, or Wonder Woman's lack of knowledge. Chris Pine does all the work and Gal Gadot is a sexy set-piece. Example of both: when they are walking through London, and Gal Gadot is wearing her armour with an overcoat. I don't remember why, but she starts to open it up, and Chris Pine has a fit that she can't walk around like that, he needs to buy her some clothes. So they go to buy clothes, and we get about five minutes of Gal Gadot trying on clothes, doing high kicks in a dress (which tears), and asking how a woman can fight it these things. We are gifted with five minutes of seeing Gal Gadot try on different clothes and some really shoddy humour.<br/><br/>All in all, this another generic superhero that has received way too much praise, it's boring--where a superhero movie should be fun--, the plot is contrived, the comedic relief is bad, the things that happen go way too far. I'd put this in a similar basket to the second two Iron Man movies."

","I do wonder when the superhero theme will lose it's appeal. Every story is much the same when it comes right down to it. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman starts off OK, you see the island that the warrior women are on and a snippet of their training and warrior ways. You get a bit of a background on how they came to be. <br/><br/>Soon it jumps to World War 1, whether it is WW1 period where the island is or the island is in it's own time zone I am not sure. The Warrior women haven't advanced beyond the bronze age though as they prepare to fight the invading German's who have pierced some kind of invisible cloak into their world still use swords and horse cavalry. <br/><br/>And why is it always the Germans in these films? How cliché has that become? Especially in films set in WW2, what about the Japanese? The Russians? The Italians? The Turks? <br/><br/>WW then befriends an American spy and goes off to the real world to fight war himself. Or so she thinks. It starts going from mildly interesting to cliché comic book about here. <br/><br/>WW is a pacifist but a warrior. She is a warrior but shocked by how much more brutal war is in the real world then her home island where they trained for war as if it were B grade sexploitation gladiator flick. <br/><br/>She is shocked to find that the people (mostly men) aren't as perfect as she seemingly is. She criticizes the Scottish sniper for not being able to shoot, yet she is a pacifist. <br/><br/>On the front line she charges into German machine gun fire, German soldiers too stupid or poorly trained to aim for her mostly unprotected legs. <br/><br/>And how is it that these Goddesses can die from gun shots anyway?<br/><br/>And so it goes on.

Then the widest and mass usage of chemical weapons was British using it against Russian Bolsheviks. <br/><br/>Furthermore, there was no plan or what so ever like preparing an attack with chemical weapons to hit allied forces, especially from German's nor the Turks.

"asifahsankhan","9","4","12","25 July 2017"," The DC Extended Universe finally finds a balance between troubled philosophy and thrilling action through Wonder Woman.
","Like it or not, 'Wonder Woman' kicked some serious asses this year as Cinematic justice was served with a female-lead movie, and by a Woman!<br/><br/>The few critics who have written sexist/poor reviews of the film (for reasons that are generally nothing to do with its calibre just FYI) have been roundly dragged by the Wonder Woman fans online. The worst of which came from the fans of DC's rival itself and those who are mostly blog writers, garnered a fair amount of negative attention for his scathing, salivating review of the film, in which they criticised Gal Gadot (Because the film's star is Israeli, duh!) and accuses positive critics of ""grading on a big curve"" (um, ouch!). <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Wonder Woman continued (still continues) to smash the pitifully low critics and the expectations of every film industry out there.<br/><br/>(Sidebar: The two best and utterly shockingly genre-shifting superhero films of this year: Logan and Wonder Woman both will go down in history as comic-book genre landmarks).<br/><br/>Wonder Woman, the film represents a number of delicate balancing acts: between humour and gravitas; angst and adventure; full-blown, unvarnished superhero fantasy and the DCEU's usual unpacking of what those fantasies mean. But its most impressive balancing routine may be the one that plays out between Steve and Diana over whether the Ares myth is real, and whether the histories of gods, Amazons, and magical hidden islands have any place in the modern world. The movie's opening act on Themyscira is out-sized and mythic, but once the story returns to Steve's familiar, grubby world, Wonder Woman seems like a surreal figure, a children's story brought to life. The people who see Diana seem to recognise that she's larger than life, no less startling than a unicorn walking through 1918 London. <br/><br/>And yet there are no heroes yet in their world, so the characters have a strong urge to treat Diana as just another strikingly beautiful woman — in other words, to protect her, sideline her, and politely diminish her. And without making a fuss about it, she is in no way willing to be diminished. She's a fish out of water in 1918 London, which gives Wonder Woman a fair number of comedy pegs and opportunities for banter — and also its strongest feminist leanings, as Steve tries to control and contain Diana, and she shrugs him off and does whatever makes sense to her instead. But she's also the ultimate home-schooled kid, confidently operating under assumptions that have never come up against real-world facts. Wonder Woman gets its philosophical bent from the conflict between her pure, untested idealism and the actual gruesome realities of war, and it finds rich ground in the gap between them.<br/><br/>Such high stakes for women filmmakers and female superheroes — Jenkins' Wonder Woman is being hyped as a litmus test for whether modern cinema audiences will pack theatres to watch a superhero movie with a woman protagonist, and whether a woman director can bring the blockbuster action. But while Wonder Woman is supremely calculated in its gender politics and its gender role reversals, the question of how a female hero sees the world winds up being less interesting than the question of how an entirely self-assured hero sees it. The DCEU's Batman and Superman are both tormented by their solitude and their histories; as a one-of-a-kind being, Wonder Woman takes her solitude for granted, and her history is almost entirely of her own choosing. Her femininity is part of the story, for the way it makes even the other heroes in the movie underestimate and discount her. But her gender is never the story's primary thrust.<br/><br/>Instead, Wonder Woman focuses on the horrors of war, the pleasures of camaraderie, and plain, old-fashioned super-heroics. The DCEU's Batman tortures criminals and tries to murder Superman, while Superman himself accidentally destroys cities, and is forced to murder villains. Wonder Woman simply fights injustice and saves lives. It is, frankly, a relief.<br/><br/>This is indeed a tremendous win for a franchise that desperately needed one. Doesn't matter whether you're a Marvel fan or a DC fan, this isn't about you or your fandom, it's about the industry and the whole comic-book genre itself. <br/><br/>This DC movie has the charm to burn. And that's no back-hand compliment. It's genuine praise. This is nit-picking of the highest order. Wonder Woman is a solid Crowd-Pleaser, so go join the crowd!"
"georgegaeke","3","4","12","22 July 2017"," An Insult to Veterans and a Disservice to Humanity
","Let me first say that I am not a fan of superhero movies at the best of times. I don't like them for several reasons. Even though they are considered fantasy, they still propagate the myth that making this world a better place is the responsibility of someone else: some hero will eventually come along and save the day. As viewers, we are drawn into a dreamy state of false security, instead of doing our part to better the world here and now. Plus, they are almost always male. And, the solution to the problem presented in the movie is always violence.<br/><br/>I had a hope, then, that Wonder Woman would be something different. A female lead, perhaps solutions other than violence, something other than the usual superhero garbage.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this superhero movie was even worse than the usual fantasy superhero movie as it tried to tie into real history. In fact, in an interview that I saw with the director, Patty Jenkins, she even stated that was one of her goals for the movie, to accurately represent WWI history. What an insult to veterans.<br/><br/>Why do I say that? Throughout the movie, Diana keeps saying if she can kill Ares, then the war will end. She kills Ares, and lo and behold, the war does end. If I was a veteran of any war, I would boycott a movie with that kind of message, especially one that is set in a real, historical context.<br/><br/>I have one more criticism. The movie ends with Diana basically saying that she has learned that love is the only way to really solve the worlds problems. Um, how did she learn that? She only solved anything in the movie by fighting and killing. Very hypocritical. Did she learn that little gem from Chris Pine's character's self sacrifice? Perhaps, but that was a completely unnecessary sacrifice (he's close to the ocean, fly the plane into the water, jump with a parachute) - and rumour has it he really didn't die as he is expected to be in the sequel.<br/><br/>No redeeming of superhero movies for me here. If you want to turn your mind off and watch some mindless action, then that's what you'll get."

Chris Pine played a fantastic Steve Trevor because of how charismatic he was, and that just made the whole role that much more great. When the movie opens it is on the Amazonian island where there is only women and no men. The island looks beautiful and they didn't over use CGI it looked stunning. When they tell us that the sword created by the Gods is not the weapon to kill Ares and it's actually Wonder Woman was GREAT! I'm a DC fanboy so I already knew that but if I didn't I would be amazed.

I guess there were secret shipments of language books from Amazon.com going into the island.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>You never see a weak point for Wonder Woman during the film. She was basically invincible.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A dreadful interpretation of WW1, a catastrophe with so many dead on all sides. The movie simplifies it as: The Germans are the evil bad guys and can be killed without remorse, and the British are the good guys.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Germans are speaking to each other in English throughout the whole film. What?!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Overuse of slow motion during the fight sequences.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The CGI at times was so bad it was comparable to that of the low budget CW DC shows.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The twist revealing the main villain was so badly executed. The casting choice was a no-no in my opinion, not to mention the battle was more of a video game than a film, and every word he said during this battle was cringe-worthy.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ares has Zeus's lightning powers for some reason.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ares kept telling Diana that humans choose to be evil and that he does not force them to, yet once she kills him the German soldiers drop their weapons and become good people.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Steve Trevor decided to commit suicide for no reason. He had control of the plane containing the lethal poison, which he could have gotten rid of in so many ways, but he decided to fly high up in the sky and blow up the plane with himself in it.</li></ul><br/><br/>I do not understand all the praise this average film has gotten from the professional film critics. Perhaps they were afraid they would be considered as ""anti-feminist"" and would be boycotted by everyone if they had given it a low score?"

","So DC finally got one right, isn't that what everyone's saying? I completely agree, Wonder Woman was much better than anything else DC has released in a very long time, and it was a pretty great film, but was it as amazing as everyone say it was or are we all a bit bias due to the hype surrounding the film? In the first blockbuster superhero film featuring Wonder Woman since the 1970's, we see Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) sitting in her office, remembering how it all started, and we are thrown back to the Island of the Amazons, where she is a little girl. We see her grow up and go through her training, with her aunt played admirably by the Princess Bride herself, Robin Wright, making an epic comeback. After which, a series of events lead her to meet a man and leave the island to join the war effort in England. Gal Gadot played Wonder Woman and she was truly something special, I mean to take nothing away from her or her performance with this next statement, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't point this out. While everyone got caught up in the hype of the fact that DC made a good movie, that didn't center around Batman, and the fact that this film was centered on a female superhero, they failed to see just how unoriginal the story actually was. As I was watching the scenes on this Island, with Diana growing up, not knowing what she really was, and leaving before she was ready, I was very much reminded of Thor, but that was just the first hour of the film. I thought things would get better but they didn't. She becomes this unexpected larger than life hero in World War I, much in the way that Captain America did in World War II. Both of them fought really bad guys who weren't the ""main"" bad guy behind the war, and then there is the whole God angle, which brings us right back to Thor again. The film was so well done, I think it is more than time we had a strong female hero that young girl can emulate and look up to, and I thought Gal Gadot was a breath of fresh air, who gave an outstanding performance. As far as originality goes, to me it just wasn't there, as it seems the writers took elements from two of the more popular Marvel films and mashed them together. The Bottom Line, Wonder Woman is absolutely worth seeing, however I'm all for original ideas, and I want to see something different, especially at a time when a new superhero film is coming out every month."
"nepeta","5","4","12","28 June 2017"," Not really feminist
","I don't like super heroes and action movies in general, but because so many people posted that it was a feminist movie I had to check it up. But in my opinion it's not really feminist, it's only less sexist than the average Hollywood film. The female protagonist is a very pretty young woman, she is a warrior, but she doesn't look at all like a warrior, she's not the skinny model type, but she's too slender if compared to real life martial arts or top sportswomen, no broad shoulders, no visible arm muscles. During the film she was fighting a lot, but her face remained mainly relaxed with the lips a bit open to look sexy. A male fighter would frown, grind the teeth and spit like fighters and top athletes of both sexes do when in action. When she met people for the first time, mainly males, they would get impressed by her beauty first, so she's still a object woman. Her shoes had heels, not really handy for martial arts. The age gap between her and the male is OK, 5 years, something not common in Hollywood where most women are mainly almost 1 generation younger than men. She was too easily seduced by the first male she saw. She was frequently interrupted or given orders by the male and mostly she was OK with that. A really feminist woman would not accept a man to be giving her orders. When she sees a baby for the first time she's delighted and wants to touch it, mother instinct stereotype. At least in the beginning of the films some older women were also in the scene."
"saniyissilly","5","4","12","26 June 2017"," Standout film among the new DCEU
","After the mild success of man of steel and the dreadful BvS, I din't know what to think of DC's next installment to their cinematic universe. After my first viewing I was genuinely surprised by Patty Jenkins' ""Wonder Woman."" Lets break it all down.<br/><br/>Acting: Gal Gadot is fantastic as Princess Diana/WW. After watching it I can't really think of anyone who could fit the character better than her. Due to Gal's success it's easy for another person's great performance to get overlooked. Chris pine shines as Diana's sidekick, Steve Trevor. His character had depth, was layered, and his sacrifice at the end felt very in character.<br/><br/>Visual Effects: I was not in love with the the visual effects. Everything looked a little fake, especially wonder woman's jumping. The slo-mo was overused to the point where it got ridiculous.<br/><br/>The main problem I had with this film was the underwhelming reveal of Ares' true identity as Sir Patrick. After Diana kills General Ludendorff and sees the soldiers continuing to prepare for battle, she realizes that he wasn't Ares. She then breaks down and Steve explains to her that maybe she was wrong, maybe it's humanity that has the destructive tendencies that leads inevitably lead to war and fighting. I wish the film had followed up on this idea because it would have been a cool introspective commentary on the volatility of humankind, as well as a new approach to a superhero film that I did not see coming at all. Instead they had to ruin with a by the numbers face off between a villain who wants to team up with the hero in order to fulfill his violent aspirations, and the hero who refuses to give in. The actual fighting reminded me a lot of the final battle in BvS.<br/><br/>I loved how we got to see Diana's motives, how the film started out in the present and you got to see how the past affected her choices that she made in BvS, and ones she'll likely make in the future film. Overall, there was a great development of Diana's character, to the point where everything she did felt in character and natural. It was awesome finally seeing a good Female superhero movie. Aside from the final battle and the visual effects, I thought wonder woman was a great film and a step in the right direction for the new DC universe.<br/><br/>8/10"
"clismanrr","9","4","12","24 June 2017"," Great and inspiring, with okay cgi
","i overheard a few fans at premiere day calling it a bad movie, that Gal's performance was weak, that she lacked the fierce and bold character, it wasn't feminist enough, I just couldn't see any of that after watching the movie.. Besides the okay CGI, the film almost met my expectations, and they were pretty high. Those that complain on the lack of wonder woman's boldness, independence and feminism know too little on parenting, Diana's mom did not allow her to abide by the philosophies of a being a warrior at a young age, which means that Diana would grow as an innocent and naive young lady. Yes she has her training, yes people wanted her character to be just as Antiope's was, but you have to be wise enough to understand that she is still too young and unfamiliar to threat, someone who was first raised as a sweet, pacifist, respectful and innocent little girl protected by her mother. She then walks into a world full of violence, which she was not ready for psychologically, This ""lack of feminism"" I constantly hear about outstandingly appears when she stands strong against high ranking officers and leaders, denouncing them as cowards in hiding, while her desire was to fight injustice alongside those in the front lines, proving that she is worthy of being Wonder Woman. To be honest, Gal portrays the perfect woman, who respects Steve, listens to Steve, dressed up for Steve, follows Steve, but also challenges him and other people when she knows her beliefs are justified and takes action herself without their approval, but never goes psycho and nuts like 99% of women in this world. She led the men into battle, where even a blind man can see that the indecisive soldiers were under the right leader. Once she stands up against the evils of men and war, she tenderly goes back to Steve and dances with him. As the proudly straight, women loving man that I am, I applaud this character and film for standing up against the overused and awful baby and sandwich making-only stereotype. It didn't meet my expectations because the villain was a disappointment. The film did a great job hyping it up, only to finally see Ares as an old and laughable looking villain. And just like Batman vs superman, this film was setting up for what's to come in justice league, can't wait!"
"roegasu","8","4","12","22 June 2017"," Easily the best DCEU movie
","WW is easily the best DCEU movie so far. While the plot is similar to the first Captain America - because they're both origin stories, and set in the WW1 - WW2 era -, the action and atmosphere are much better.<br/><br/>There is no extreme feminist agenda here, WW is simply a woman who sees something wrong and has the power and the will to take action against it. Gal Gadot performs her role beautifully, acting as a woman who's both tactful and a pacifist by nature, while displaying amazing battle prowess and her supernatural powers in beautiful combat choreography when required. But she never boasts, never shows any kind of negative pride or a desire to look down on others. Her abilities, wit and intellect flow off of her naturally. By her actions, or lack thereof, she earns the respect of the men around her, and the viewers on the other side of the screen.<br/><br/>The plot is nothing special, but since when is it ever when it comes to superhero flicks? It's not bad either, and the storytelling and visuals are more than good enough to deliver a thoroughly entertaining experience. While the movie suffers from a few scenes with merely average CGI, and a few clichés too, which bring the score down to 8 for me, the fact remains that WW had multiple scenes that literally rocked so hard that I and my friends got goosebumps more than once.<br/><br/>Knowing Gal Gadot's background as a woman trained (and training others) in Israeli defense forces, someone who was not simply happily building her career on her looks and beauty competitions alone, but wanted more - someone who walked their own way through life, who went and earned her success with more than just her looks and sex -, the connection to the way she portrays Wonder Woman is especially strong and meaningful. It's an incredibly rare thing to see women on screen that are effortlessly beautiful, feminine, and genuinely nice and likable, yet have such powerful leadership charisma, obvious strength of will and character, and a great sense of purpose all at the same time. Which is exactly what Wonder Woman is supposed to be.<br/><br/>In conclusion I have to say that I went in with some high expectations, and still came out positively surprised. I can honestly recommend this movie to anyone. And while I don't want to go on about political agendas here, it has to be said: If there has ever been a perfect figurehead for real feminism for grown-ups and children alike in the world of movies and entertainment, this is it. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. No complaining, no excuses, just attitude, hard work, and passion. She sees something she wants, and she does it. Herself. Period."
"mdtrot","9","4","12","14 June 2017"," Best comic book movie I've seen!
","First, I don't claim to be any sort of sophisticated movie reviewer. I just know I cared about the characters, as well as the poor civilians and soldiers depicted paying the price of war. I thought Gadot strongly evinced a sense of shock and grief at what was happening to the children.<br/><br/>I like the way they employed long scenes of conversation between characters who were deliberating issues of right and wrong. Many super hero movies, such as the recent Guardians of the Galaxy(which I did enjoy), just have way too much constant action and fighting, to the point that they don't make you care as much about the outcome of the conflict. In WW, they spend the requisite time to leave no doubt that the Germans were evil and the allies were good, plain and simple, and you want Diana to prevail. And not only that, but they also explored the issue that it is a danger to all our futures when good people throw up their hands and fail to oppose evil. <br/><br/>Also, I like the way they made it clear that, while Ares could put it into peoples' minds to commit heinous acts against their fellow man, it was ultimately the decision and responsibility of individual persons for carrying out such evil deeds. I will definitely be getting this on Blu-ray!"
"Sparse","Null","4","12","13 June 2017"," Far Better than the DCEU Deserved (Up to this Point)
","I wouldn't call Wonder Woman, as some seem to be doing, ""one of the greatest superhero movies of all time"", though I'd still say it's. . . . above average.<br/><br/>Not-as-clever-as-I-think-they-are references aside, this film is of somewhat mixed quality, yet its strengths greatly outshine its weaknesses. It's a very refreshing film, not only within context of the DCEU, but as a superhero film, period. Wonder Woman not only has ambitions, but its ambitions (generally) pan out. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is the second theatrical, feature-length film directed by Patty Jenkins. Overall, this film left positive impressions, and I'll be watching her first film ""Monster"" shortly. The film is generally well-framed, well-paced, and well-directed. Throughout the film you get a great sense of space, and that the world you see on screen is actually inhabited (unlike the preceding DCEU films). However, there are a handful of notable flaws, specifically the inconsistency of direction when it regards action.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is admittedly all over the place. The better action sequences are actually rather impressive, using long takes and organic choreography in stunning fashion and execution. If the film had stayed consistent in that regard, it would have been far more engaging. However, there is a jarring, over-presence of slow-motion, presumably in efforts to maintain stylistic consistency with the preceding Snyder-isms. Said Snyder-isms however were also bizarre and jarring, and the decision to continue such stylizations was frankly a bad decision. The slow motion in Wonder Woman more often than not takes you out of the film from what otherwise could have been an engaging action sequence. There is also an instance-or-two of shaky-cam, though in comparison to the aforementioned offence is bearable.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is the first movie in the DCEU to get the hang of the basics of storytelling, and not only that, but it's done generally pretty well. The screenplay was written by Allan Heinberg, with Patty Jenkins working with him closely to ensure the film's competency. One of the story credits however is by Snyder himself, which thankfully seems to have been kept to a minimum. The dialogue contains some good humor throughout the film, and the overall plot, refreshingly, is an actual plot! Things happen, and cohesively too! There are a few problems I had, mainly in regards to the climax/ending.<br/><br/>First, the extra battle with Ares (containing a frankly dumb character twist) at the end is completely overblown, and undermines what would otherwise have been a strong climax with a fairly powerful statement about humanity. I'll give the better, preceding climax credit for being emotionally-potent though, and even provoking a tear. Why they decided to send it all to hell after that is completely beyond me. The show-don't- tell principle was also respected, albeit briefly, as the very end contains a redundantly irritating narration. There was also a shoehorned reminder that this film is connected to Batman v Superman (which fills me with unending frustration and heartbreak), and decides that a completely forced, poorly framed, and poorly composited shot of Wonder Woman soaring through the air is necessary for some reason. As dumb as that was, I'm not going to hold it against its overall quality too much.<br/><br/>Now for the strongest part of the writing: There is definitely a strong theme of duality within this film, and not only about good/evil within humanity. Tale the focus on women at the beginning of the film, and the focus on men towards the end. The color in the first act, and the greys towards third. It's a deconstruction of dichotomies, revealing the similarities and close relation of it all in a rather well-done painting of duality. This alone makes it more ambitious than most other superhero films, and better yet, its ambitions are executed with competency.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are a delight in this movie. They have great chemistry, and really carry the film with strong, funny, and emotionally-invested performances. The supporting cast is generally fine, and sometimes even good as well, but it's Pine and Gatot that really stole the show. The villains are admittedly a little over the top, though I'd attribute that particular flaw to the writing.<br/><br/>The CGI isn't very strong all of the time. I usually found it passable, but the more overblown segments suffer from this lack-of-quality heavily. That being said, the colors are very nice, the costume design is good, and the art direction especially is spot on: particularly the war sets, and the magnificent highlight that is the island of Themyscira. <br/><br/>I have mixed feelings on the music in this movie. The score is by Rupert Gregson- Williams. . . . and also at least five other people, and it shows (I check the music department credits, I don't make this up y'know). On one hand, this is the first DCEU movie in which the music is solidly serviceable to the film, rather than minimally so. On the other hand however, the score is still very generic, as you'd expect from a score produced by Remote Control Studios. The largest detriment in the score however is still the painfully out-of-place Wonder Woman theme carrying over from Dawn of Justice--which to be fair is a fine melody on its own, but it doesn't fit Wonder Woman in the slightest. I'll at least give them credit for attempting thematic consistency though, I just wish there was a different and more fitting theme to be consistent with.<br/><br/>Parts of this film are worthy of a 9/10. Other parts are more suited for a 7/10 or lower, but its strengths persist and carry the film nicely. I am happy to say that Wonder Woman is the first DCEU film that I'd give a solid recommendation to. It also might be the last one until Matt Reeve's ""Batman"", so yeah. . . . um. . . .<br/><br/>Score: 8/10"
"RodrigAndrisan","7","4","12","11 June 2017"," Gal Gadot much sexy than Brigitte Bardot!

However, in the end, it lacked storyline and emotional connection that it was trying for mostly because it was rated PG-13. I get that the studio is trying to pander to the widest audience as possible but in the end it doesn't pander to anyone beyond the basic 5 year old whose parents brought them to the movie because it was a 'Super-Hero' movie that they believed their kids would like the movie.

"gortx","Null","4","12","7 June 2017"," Wonder Woman - Keep Calm & Enjoy
","WONDER WOMAN is a fine, solid superhero film. Usually, that would suffice, but, in this social media age, the movie has become a symbol. A cause. As a result, it is being both over and under praised, often for reasons far removed from what is actually on screen.<br/><br/>I didn't grow up watching the Lynda Carter TV series and have only the vaguest memories of the Cathy Lee Crosby TV movie, so my main introduction to the character was the Super Friends cartoons of the 70s with her invisible plane and truth lasso. I give credit to D.C., Warners and the filmmakers for casting a foreign actress with a distinct accent, keeping it a period production and for shooting it on 35mm Film (even seen on digital, it gives the film a certain heavier, more dense look).<br/><br/>On a story level, it follows a pretty standard comic book origin story, with a couple of unique twists. The pacing is fairly slow and certain elements didn't really need to be lingered on so long (it's the 377th superhero film - we can fill in most of the details). But, Director Patty Jenkins does a really good job of delivering on the promise of giving this female led tale a genuine P.O.V., without overstating her case. It's a tricky balance but she pulls it off. Of course, she is abetted by a strong cast, pretty much from top to bottom, and not confined to the leads. Casting David Thewlis in the pivotal Sir Patrick role really makes the film work (so, too Pine as the male lead). Naturally, if Gal Gadot didn't succeed in the title role, the whole thing collapses. Gadot is more than up to the challenge. She more than carries off the different beats to her character (and the story). And, yes, this ex-Israeli military woman convinces as a warrior (although a couple of shots do give away that her stunt double is a bit thicker body-wise). Hopefully, future films in the series will allow her to display a lighter side to the character.<br/><br/>The only real problems with the film (aside from the pacing issues) are that there is tension between the superhero story-line and the deadly serious WWI backdrop. It's not fatal by any means, but you have a sense that they wanted to be able to let Wonder Woman loose, but felt constrained at times. Add in the dark ugly hues employed (despite Jenkins in the Director's seat, it was still produced by Zach Snyder, after all). And, sadly, there is the inevitable superhero movie cliché of the 'epic' battle at the end with an accompanying CGI overload (and can we please put a moratorium on slow-mo/ramping digital effects during battle scenes?). Fortunately, the aftermath of the battle and the epilogue return the film to it's emotional core.<br/><br/>WONDER WOMAN is just fine as a film, but, it's not the greatest thing since sliced-bread as it's strongest backers would have it. It does very well, but, it stays pretty much within the lane of current superhero movies, even if superior to most. The female touch and perspective ARE very important and I am heartened to see so many young women and girls who have bonded with the character (and many of their elders even openly weeping with joy), but, the over-praise has resulted in the inevitable backlash. I urge everybody to approach the film with perspective. Just sit back and savor it. As the British might say: Keep Calm and Enjoy.<br/><br/>P.S. Gregson-Williams' ""score"" is awful. More like blathering notes used as a sound effect than actual musical backing. I put score in quotes in deference to actual composers like Herrmann, Rosza and John Williams."

"PyroSikTh","8","4","12","3 June 2017"," Proof that Women can make Superhero Movies too.
","Wonder Woman is an origin story, following Diana Prince as she grows up in Themyscira; an island hidden from the rest of humanity, and entirely inhabited by women known as the Amazons. The Amazons are a race of women placed on Earth by Zeus to instil love and hope into the hearts of mankind, but after a betrayal from Ares causes mankind to turn on itself, they secluded themselves from the outside world. Enter Steve Trevor who crash lands on the island during World War One, followed by his German pursuers, opening Diana's eyes to the outside world for the first time, and pitting her on a path to face Ares himself and stop the war to end all wars.<br/><br/>As is becoming the running theme of the DCEU, and setting itself thematically apart from the MCU, Diana is a literal demi-goddess. Even at an early age she shows that she's more than just your regular Amazon. Even outside of Themyscira she shows that she's more than just a woman. She represents an ideal, she's a symbol of love and hope, and her quest to kill Ares is as symbolic as stopping the war itself - not just World War One, but all wars (of course, only to realise that that's just human nature).<br/><br/>And yet Patty Jenkins very deliberately makes sure that this larger-than-life take on Wonder Woman doesn't run away with her. She grounds her and makes her relatable with a three-dimensional personality. Gal Gadot certainly lives up to the pressures the role demands of her. I was extremely skeptical of her casting (she wasn't even the best actor in the Fast & Furious franchise, which is saying a lot), and even BvS didn't really do enough to allay my fears. And yet here we are, and she is absolutely the best Wonder Woman we could have ever hoped for. She perfectly embodies Diana's charming naivety and innocence in this world that's completely new to her, and carefully ensures that Diana doesn't just appear dimwitted in the face of it all. Her reactions to seeing a baby and tasting ice cream for the first time are quintessentially endearing, and her complete disregard for societal expectations of women at the turn of the 20th century lends to a lot of comedy at humanity's expense rather than hers.<br/><br/>Her relationship with Steve Trevor is also a big success of the movie, not shying away from the more romantic perspective of it, but also without making it a big focus. Gadot and Chris Pine share such a tantalising chemistry together that it makes Pine's unlikeliness to come back a real shame (the sequel is reportedly taking place in modern times, post-Justice League). Pine gives Trevor such a charming persona that its hard not to like him, even when he shows signs of an inflated ego. His interactions with Gadot's Diana are hugely entertaining to watch, whether they be for comedic, romantic, or dramatic purposes. Every line of dialogue between them feels natural and sticks the landing perfectly.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman's visuals are a bit of a mixed bag across the board. There are some great visual treats to behold, particularly the recreation of Themyscira and Gadot's entire wardrobe department. Set-pieces and costumes are top-notch design work and all look great. However much of the CGI appears unfinished (and may explain Ares god-awful tin can appearance). Many of the backdrops in action sequences are green-screen, and it's plainly obvious, and many of the more outlandish stunts, as impressive as they are to watch, are almost entirely computer- generated. There's one moment early on when an Amazon dramatically swings down a cliff, but is shot by a German rifleman on the way down. It's great until she's hit by the bullet and suddenly it becomes obvious she was entirely computer-generated, with unnatural movements and reactions. The kicker is this sequence was completely unnecessary to CGI; they could've easily done it with a crane and stuntwoman instead, and kept far away from the uncanny valley being an issue.<br/><br/>That said there are some bits of stuntwork that absolutely needed CGI to bring to life, and even without the fine tuning the effects needed, they still look hugely impressive. Wonder Woman is bristling with fantastic action sequences, the standout of which being her first big one as Wonder Woman, as she steps out into No Man's Land, takes everything the Germans have, and bursts through the trenches to get to a village on the other side, flipping tanks, demolishing church towers and liberating the village from it's German enslavers. Everything from the bullet-deflections, to her twirling and spinning in stylish choreography, to the brute force of tank-flipping looks great and is massively entertaining.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is not only the movie the DCEU needed, but also the movie Hollywood, and specifically big action blockbusters needed. It's strive for gender equality was pitch perfect, being as important behind the scenes as it was in front of the camera. It boasts the best Wonder Woman we could hope for, with a perfect performance from Gal Gadot and an equally as great performance from Chris Pine to bounce off. The action sequences are breathtaking and are certain to mark this movie out from the realm of superhero movies alone. But, and I must stress this, it's not perfect. It falters in the third act, Ares is a massive letdown of a beatstick (although the revelation of his identity is fantastic), and it doesn't give enough personality to it's lesser characters. I give Wonder Woman a high 8/10, letdown mostly by the awful presentation and appearance of Ares."

","Princess Diana of Themyscira is DC Comics' most recognizable female superhero – and actually one of the most famous and most popular overall. It's a wonder that this woman had to wait so long to have a movie of her own, especially considering how long Hollywood has been giving us superhero movies and how many of them have been made. Wonder Woman first appeared in DC Comics in 1941 and has had her own comic book series ever since. In 1975, the character finally made her flesh-and-blood debut with her eponymous TV series starring Lynda Carter as the Amazon princess who, under the name of Diana Prince, used her superpowers, her Lasso of Truth and her invisible airplane to help the U.S. Army fight the Nazis in World War II. But that series only lasted until 1979. In the years since, DC superheroes like Superman and Batman have each appeared on the big screen in multiple incarnations, with different actors playing the roles. When those two made a movie together in 2016, Wonder Woman (played by Israeli actress Gal Gadot) joined them and the following year finally gets a movie all her own. And ""Wonder Woman"" (PG-13, 2:21) is only the beginning.<br/><br/>Diana (Gadot) grows up on the isolated, uncharted island of Themyscira, the only child on the island and last child of the Greek god Zeus. Diana is fascinated by the constant close combat training of the adult Amazon women around her and wants to learn to fight too. Diana's mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), doesn't want that for her daughter, but Hippolyta's sister, General Antiope (Robin Wright, from Netflix's ""House of Cards""), secretly indulges the young girl's desire. Diana grows up hearing tales of how Ares, the God of War, killed all of the other gods and, jealous of Zeus' affection for mankind, wants to use his powers to end their existence on earth. Ares' rivalry with Zeus culminates in Ares mortally wounding Zeus, who created and placed on Themyscira a weapon capable of killing Ares. As Diana matures, she becomes well-educated and, eventually with her mother's grudging approval, also becomes a skilled fighter. She instructs Antiope to train Diana harder than any Amazon has ever been trained, alluding to a secret from Diana's past, and a destiny she doesn't want to reveal to her daughter.<br/><br/>Diana's idyllic world is shattered one day when an American fighter pilot named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands in the waters surrounding Themyscira. Diana saves his life and protects him as the Germans pursuing him come ashore and get into a fierce battle with the Amazons. Afterwards, Diana, struggling to get over the novelty of seeing her first man, uses her Lasso of Truth to learn who Steve is and what he's doing there. She hears of the horrors of the ongoing War to End All Wars (which no one yet realizes is only the First World War) and becomes convinced that Ares must be responsible. Steve has stolen the notes of a German chemical warfare mastermind known as Doctor Poison (Elena Anaya) and is determined to deliver it to his superiors in London. Diana convinces Steve that she can help him do that if he will then take her to the front where she is convinced that she can stop the war. These goals run the pair afoul of sadistic German General Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis), a government official who doesn't want his armistice negotiations derailed.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" serves the time-honored character, her followers and your average #MovieFan fairly well. The script comes from Allan Heinberg (a long-time television writer crossing over into film for the first time), based on a story by himself, Jason Fuchs (writer of ""Pan"" & ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"") and Zach Snyder (who is one of the producers of this film and is known for writing and/or directing the ""300"" films, ""Sucker Punch"", the 2013 and 2016 Superman movies and November 2017's ""Justice League""). The plot serves as a good origin story for the title character, even enhancing her mythology and placing her in World War I (rather than WWII, like the 1970s TV series), allowing for subtext which includes women's rights (the suffrage movement) and the development of modern mechanized warfare (large-scale killing of people at a distance). The culture shock she experiences meeting men and encountering western society for the first time allows for amusing and humorous moments which feel organic. The action is intense, but the violence relatively bloodless. And the heroine's appearance is terrifically styled.<br/><br/>Topping the list of the movie's significant strengths (and hiding its weaknesses) is the great acting, especially Godot's. The beautiful, agile and talented actress is the perfect choice to bring this character into the 21st century, giving her a complex and pleasing mix of strength, vulnerability, determination, compassion, intelligence and sex appeal. She's a warrior, a woman and, most of all, a human being. On closer inspection, however, the film's flaws emerge. The character of General Ludendorff behaves and transforms in ways that aren't only far removed from the historical record, but which don't even make sense in the context of the plot. The same holds true for some of the other characters, but the film's larger problem is in its overall plotting. The rote interpretation of superhero genre conventions keeps the movie from being as creative and exciting as it could have and should have been. Still, ""Wonder Woman"" is the best DC film since the 2005-2012 Christopher Nolan / Christian Bale ""Batman"" series and it's refreshingly lighter in tone than that trilogy and other cinematic incarnations of the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This movie, in spite of its imperfections, is strong and entertaining enough to warrant a recommendation – and give Movie Fans hope for the cinematic future of the Amazon princess and her DC partners in fighting for justice.

","After reading reviews and forcing myself to watch this ""movie"", as well as having been a LONG time WW fan..........I can honestly say that WB/DC has blatantly paid off critics, padded box office receipts, and planted ""fans"" of the movie around the globe in order to prevent the box office FLOP this truly is. I wouldn't even put it past them to have a squadron of paid people online writing fake five star reviews for this disaster. It's been done before with many movies that companies could not lose money on.<br/><br/>WB/DC could not afford yet another dull loser movie at the box office. And seeing as NOBODY on this film did ANY research into the story or character of the REAL Wonder Woman (as they even stated in interviews), it shows. And WB/DC knowing that they had created another HUGE dullard of a movie, had to run to their checkbooks to start paying off critics right and left. Otherwise, how could critics give it such high reviews before the thing was ever even put on film? BIG RED FLAG on that right there.<br/><br/>If the REAL box office numbers were published, I can guarantee they would be less than half of what WB/DC claim they are. The ONLY thing that was ""Wonder Woman"" about this movie was the title.<br/><br/>This piece of garbage is the exact OPPOSITE of what the REAL, TRUE Wonder Woman is. She is definitely not a mass murdering killing machine!<br/><br/>And what makes this even more horrible, is that Lynda Carter allowed herself to be brought in on this ludicrous fiasco. A sad day indeed.<br/><br/>So much for this now EX-Wonder Woman fan."
"Ganters","3","3","8","30 April 2018"," Thin USA superhero action film
","I've seen the same film so many times now, the superhero discovering their abilites and saving the whole world in a battle with the bad guy, the end. And sometimes the formula works, wether it's because the film-making, writing and acting is just that good, or because an element is added or style is changed. Here however, we have the basic dumb plot with the same special effects we've seen again and again. Are we really this gullable? Have we been fed with this so long that our best defence for cinema like this is ""Sometimes you just want to shut down the brain.""?<br/><br/>The style of Wonder Woman is so USA that it feels like a parody. The action shots are too quick and emotionless, I feel like I'm watching actors fight with special effects instead of watching superheroes battling important fights. The music is bland, like the rest of the Marvel Universe Film Series, with the exception of one rocking song played a couple of times during the film (f.e. during a fight in a room with guns and a table). We see no real shine among the actors or the dialogue.<br/><br/>Before I watched this I actually heard it was supposed to be a bit feministic. I found the opposit to be true, what with men and women having stereotypical film traits and the women being scantily clad for the enjoyment of the eye and objectification. What annoyed me the most about this was that Wonderwoman herself, who was supposed to be this extremely powerful superhero with high intelligence, was constantly made out to be dumb and weak. I was hoping that for once a female superhero could have the spotlight the men of the USA superhero genre has, with the same coolness and ability. Instead we follow along as Wonderwoman gets babysat throughout the film by a male character who sometimes actually feels like the protagonist instead of Wonderwoman.<br/><br/>The three stars it gets is for the high production and the dull enjoyment, and the good moments the movie did have."

","I just saw Wonder Woman for the first time.
I was expecting a lightweight popcorn action movie, where I could just shut off my brain and enjoy some PG13 action...<br/><br/>Now there are many issues with this movie.
The special effects are questionable at best, considering this is supposed to be a blockbuster movie.
The story is about as flat as the Bolivian salt flats.<br/><br/>But what actually restarted my brain into working condition was the depicition of the german (soldiers) people...
I am german. And I felt ptiy for the people that actually think this movie describes germans as we are or were at the time!<br/><br/>Germans are portraied as stupid, cruel, heartless and incredibly violent people.
Now, as this theme has been apparent in many movies since the second world war. (Germans usually are portraied as either stupid and/or ruthless in their efforts)
This movie was so much over the top. It was a propaganda show par excellence, that made my blood boil red hot in anger.
I am not a german nationalist. I see myself as a European, who wants all of Europe (and I also would refer to Russa as a European state, as about 80% of the Russian people actually live in Europe) to live in peace and to aim for a common goal of unity and prosperity. 
But this movie acutually makes me hate America and its views of German people, German heritage and German behaviour toward others.<br/><br/>The people who made this should be ashamed of themselves for creating such a pile of garbage!"
"bob the moo","Null","3","8","24 March 2018"," Solid genre movie - but still a genre movie
","I watched this before watching Spiderman: Homecoming, but wrote this after doing so. Without the comparison I was already disappointed in Wonder Woman; but after watching a Marvel film, the difference was all the more evident.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman starts with a link to the modern attempt at a franchise before jumping back to an origin story. It is a simple affair in terms of setting up one main villain, and letting it play out. It does have some interesting and brave aspects to it, and I appreciated what it did in terms of the male lead and the ultimate villain, but there was a lot of baggy material around it. The supporting characters offer color but the film itself doesn't seem to spark. It is too earnest for the most part, and never gives the audience permission to enjoy it as a piece of entertainment (something that Marvel does well). The action sequences suffer from being too obviously CGI in nature, and some of the effects are surprisingly weak - in some moments it already looks dated and it has not been out that long.<br/><br/>The cast are good though, and deserve more. Gadot is much more effective on the promotional appearances than she is here. At times she is limited by her range, at others she is limited by the material. Pine is good throughout but not much more than a twinkle and good humor in terms of character. Thewlis, Huston, Bremner, and others all add quality to the cast but there is not always the material there for them. Like all the superhero films, it ends up with two special effects hitting each other surrounded by lots of CGI destruction; but what matters is what it does outside of that and leading up to it. In the case of Wonder Woman, it doesn't do enough, and takes too long to do it."

","One of the most far fetched and unrealistic movies I'd seen in a long time. The scenes of WW blocking bullets with her wrist bands get old rather quickly, yet they keep going back to it.

","Hollywood did it again. They took a great story idea and under-used it. Or just plainly screwed it up. Evil rules during WW I?? How about Evil ruling during WW II!! Now that would have been something. Diana kills the god of War in 1943. Then the SS stops hunting Jews. Wouldn't an Israeli like Gal Gadot find that more appealing? Also, I found the script pedantic and outdated for its time. I must have heard ""War is bad! Save Lives!"" about 30 times. You can tell the writers want everyone else to be total liberals, too. That's why I think the background should have been WW II. Sometimes, War is necessary. I'm also an Army Reservist with three Mobilizations. So I don't ""make war from an office"" as Diana once said self-righteously to a general, who's an obviously unlikable character (Hollywood again). And women don't bear kids! Just make them out of clay. Hollywood is full of feminists. Some scenes were very cool. Diana fights the Kaiser's Army without really killing any of them; I found that appealing. She discovers ice cream! She looks stylish in a 1916 outfit."

","Not perfect and not the feminist icon that is herald to be, but it was kind of fun. Certainly better than several other super hero movies that have come out in the past few years. I particularly liked the first part on the island where the amazons shine. Young Diana is funny (Hello Mother! How are you today?"" is my favourite quote of the movie) and the battle on the beach is really good. Antiope was the best character with Steve Trevor, I'm really sorry they both died. It was unnecessary certainly in her case, in his case he had to die as an act of human redemption.<br/><br/>As for other comments I agree that she is not the icon of independence and self determination that she usually is. And Steve Trevor drives the plot she follows. And she only finds her powers as result of the loss of her lover. Typically feminine. Life always spins around a man.<br/><br/>Many people who complain about the similarities with captain America seem to forget that they were born in the same year, 1941, during World War II. They unavoidably have some similarities.<br/><br/>People who complain about her destroying the tower when she jumps in I'm afraid never watched a DC cartoon in their lives or even the previous movies in which common people are tired of these super heroes destroying buildings and buldozing cities in their fights. Superhero movies don't have to be credible that way. As a matter of fact one of the positive things of this movie is that they kept her strength and also her capacity of taking a good beating as well as destroying buildings when she jumps into them."

That is one of the few good things I can say about the movie. To me it is quite shocking that most people don't see the heavy propaganda in this movie. Really, it is a pity as the movie could have become a quite good anti-war movie. Instead they decide that Wonder Woman takes side with the allied forces and they do very little to show how both sides were slaughtering their own people for their imperial demands. Why do they show only the Germans to use poison gas? Churchill had no problem using poison gas against civilists as he stated 1919: ""I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes"" Why don't they show the British empire enslave the people of their colonies? Why don't they show the peace movement in all countries over the world? Why doesn't wonder woman join THEM instead of one of the obviously equally evil fighting forces? They could have shown the revolutions in all over europe that actually did a lot to end the war. Instead they make a propaganda flick for a ""humanitarian"" war.A pity."

I would pay admission to watch her read from the dictionary for two hours. <br/><br/>But she was also perfect as Wonder Woman. I can't imagine anyone else ever playing that part. They'd better retire the character when Gal Gadot either gets too old or no longer wants to play Diana. <br/><br/>And, holy crap, sunshine in a DC movie? Who'd have thought that was possible?<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was excellent, too. Chris Pine does an excellent job. Ewen Bremner is great for comedy relief and compassion. I won't name everyone, but they were all perfectly cast. <br/><br/>I have to agree with the critics who say the exposition and origin story was WAAAAAYYYY too long. It's worth enduring, though, for the rest of the movie. And although I noticed the occasional Social Justice Warrior preaching in the movie, it was easy to overlook. <br/><br/>Anyway, easily an 8/10, and a fine exception to the normal DC garbage. <br/><br/>Correction: I admit, I did enjoy the first Batman with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson.

All the acting, with the exception of Ewen Bremner and Elena Anaya, is awful and pathetic; the script is full of holes (like the conversation between Dr. Maru and Chris Pine or the mercenary than only want to be an actor or the boat than in a single day sails from the Mediterranean to London), and the historic revisionism is all no sense. Gal Gadot. She do not seem very strong in this film, the other Amazons seem ten times more strong and with more character than her. Now, she say than believe in love but all the movie, she kill dozens and dozens of German soldiers without the minor remorse. OK, are German Nazis (althought in the WWI, the more criminal of all recent wars, the nazi party, they did not even exist yet). Then, we have the nice multicultural British Empire against the Evil Empire of the Pre-Nazis and his evil chemical weapons, but in the real WWI British and Frenchs used chemical weapons too!

","Wonderwoman marks the Dawn of New Hope for Justice League and DC Comics. A pretty well crafted story and action sequences (meaningful as well)peppered with witty dialogues steal the show, which was sadly missing in the over-hyped DC offering – Batman v Superman – Dawn of Justice, which almost brought dawn of distress for DC fans like me. Thankfully, Wonder Woman has exceeded all expectations and how!! The battle between the feisty Amazon warriors (residents of Themyscira) against German invaders in first few minutes of the movie sets the tone for the adventurous journey. But mind you – it's not just plain adventure but has a wonderfully woven narrative on the increasingly treacherous world with diminishing tolerance and morality.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot has given all superheroes a run for their money. She is empathetic and relentless at the same time. Chris Pine, too, holds his own in front of Gadot's gutsy play. He steps in with wisdom and presence of mind just when Diana seems a tad vulnerable. It's a superb team effort, as evidenced by Pine's parting words to Diana – I can save today, you can save the world! A must watch! <br/><br/>The underlying message that I took home was that an eye for an eye won't get the world anywhere – that's what Wonder Woman teaches you. Although the movie is set in the backdrop of World War I, the narrative holds true for today's times as well. Now, more than ever, the world needs to be tolerant and empathetic. As Wonder Woman would say – Yes humans are flawed, but they are so much more than that!"

","Patty Jenkins gave the character a softness that was perfectly combined with the harshness of the worlds created by Snyder, where the violence is not funny, the wars leave victims and consequences, and where the evil is defeated but it doesn't wash away the pain it generated. In that dark world, Wonder Woman's (and/or Gal Gadot) light shines brighter.<br/><br/>All Themyscira is perfect and beautiful, as it is all Diana's origin. But the story told works in more than the literal level. The script is superb and well above the generic ones. We have the literal Diana's adventure that ends up with her becoming the hero we know. Then we have the interpretation of War in the world. The naive notion that Diana has, about ending the world by defeating one villain. That translates to the believe that in our world there are clear ""good guys and bad guys"" and with the defeat of the ""bad one"" the wars would stop, when is clearly way more complicated than that.
And it also brings the notion of the people that benefits from War and tries to influence humans to give to them nature of war and conflict, for their benefit. I'm referring to Banks that finance wars, the industrial military complex or just plain and simply the militar arm of x country.<br/><br/>And then we have Jenkins really using the Snyder visual style, with amazing sequences and fights choreography with slow motion, but also a bombastic third act that can be a bit much. The villains could've been a bit better. And maybe a bit faster here and there, maybe. Maybe one or two less ""slow motion"" scenes."

Chris Pine is brilliant as usual and there is a definite chemistry on screen.
The action is superb with some fantastic fight scenes.
Despite a number of reviews saying it was boring the pacing is one of the best aspects of the film. Knowing when to slow it down enough for us to get some build the characters and the world without ever letting it drag.
My only gripe is the final act isn't as strong as the first and second. A little predictable and a tad CGI heavy. That said there is one scene that with Chris that hits the mark perfectly.<br/><br/>A film that stands up on multiple rewatches I give this 9/10.<br/><br/>I fealt inclined to review this after reading so many of the sad little bed wetters give it one out of ten despite not actually finding much to say about it. Too many people afraid of a film about female hero, by a female director changing the status quo.

","I don't understand how and why this movie is getting good reviews when there are a lot of things in this that are just awful. <br/><br/>Gal Gadot is a very bad actress, she looks the part, but sadly cannot act the part. And much like Man of Steel this is a movie that has very little tension with our main character because they are completely invincible and have no weaknesses. If you're going to remove weakness of a character then the movie is just going to fail. All main characters have to have a weakness to overcome, or at least some sort of purposeful character flaw to make them interesting. So whenever I see Wonder Woman fighting in battle and barely taking any damage or even scratches then there's n tension and then there's no investment. People say that this movie is colorful; I don't see it. All I see is a bunch of black, blue's and grey's. Wonder Woman's costume looks great but that's only because it has any sort of pop to it to make it stand out. Some would see that as a positive, but it unfortunately makes her surroundings all the more unappealing. I don't know who does the visual effects for these movies, but they're awful. There's nothing dynamic about each shot, nothing stands out, nothing is visually appealing, nothing is anything! I didn't even think the movie was that funny. These are jokes that have been done a million times and are not done in anyway to make them feel fresh and new. All of the other characters are completely forgettable with the exception of Chris Pine - he was OK. Wonder Woman herself is surrounded by clichés. If the movie is supposed to be pro feminism, I expect to not see any of the typical clichés associated with most movies about women. I saw a lot of them: the prejudice daughter going against her overbearing mother, the changing of the clothes scene, the fact that in the end Wonder Woman has a love interest instead of just being friends and/or partners, etc. And that ending...just ugh. OK so the movie is about how Wonder Woman wants to find Ares so she can kill him and end WWI. At the very end, it seems that Ares isn't real and that the war is still going. Chris Pine even has a speech saying that there is no one-person to blame, but rather multiple people. That would've been very smart, and even have some commentary on todays events. But what happens then? Ares turns out is real and we spend the last 10 to 15 minutes with Wonder Woman fighting Ares. In the end Ares is dead and the war is over, showing that there is only one person to blame in war; which is not only preachy but also offensive considering that they're saying that Ares was responsible for WWI. <br/><br/>I know that Marvel likes to do clichés as well, but they either do it in a way to make it feel new and original, or they only use the best little but big clichés: like walking away from explosions, things blowing in the wind, etc. But this movie doesn't do any of that. And that ending completely ruins the film. For the most part, the film was rather solid, but by the time we get to that ending everything falls apart. I will compliment that this movie has a more consistent tone and a focused narrative, but that's not to say that what it has is any good. <br/><br/>This movie wan't as annoying or unfocused or offensive as the previous DC movies - in fact I can say that this is the least awful of them so far - but at best it is simply OK, and at worst is very stupid and nonsensical. There were some things that I liked, but as a whole, In the words of Roger Ebert, ""Thumbs down."""

"dolcemylife","8","4","13","7 July 2017"," Lives up to the hype
","I would first like to address all the nay-sayers, many of whom were utterly distraught by the thought of such a sub-par movie garnering all these positive reviews and glorious box-office figures, so much so that they were compelled to pay enormous attention to every detail of the film so as to faithfully recall every moment in their critique of such a terrible film, one so horrifyingly bad that people were apparently throwing good money at it in spades just to highlight its inadequacies.<br/><br/>Personally, I feel that WW is a well-balanced, emotive and empowering cinematic achievement. It stays true to the origin of the main characters AND that rather sexist costume of WW whilst threading a credible plot-line that satisfies the adult in me yet still manage to seamlessly weave highlights of supernatural accents within.<br/><br/>I can understand why the many female movie-goers are so enthralled by this movie. Once and for all, it's finally been proved that a lady can look good in combat even with her hair loose and nary a muscle-bound man in sight to lend a hand. Also helps that the female lead is multi-linguistic, has an unwavering sense of justice and doesn't pine (pun intended) her life away or feel an urgent need for another man when the last one bites the dust.<br/><br/>For a comic character to assume AND realize such a compelling and powerful persona is certainly no mean feat. Credit surely must go to the script writer and director for translating words to film and what an incredible one at that.<br/><br/>WW in essence is a tale of a SNAG (sensitive new age gal) with that 'je ne sais quoi' quality. One cannot help but root for her and wants her to succeed. It's this powerful message of hope and optimism that's probably driving all the negative critics crazy: the audacity of a CGI-driven film with a female comic character lead evoking an unfathomable sense of triumph and goodwill; what's next, females sitting on the Supreme Court? <br/><br/>The above is certainly plausible for the hate literature but then there's also the equally if not more likely fact that, said motley crew of jaded men/women have probably, at one point or another of their collectively miserable lives, harbour the secret desire to be Wonder Woman herself, if only even to rock a metallic head-band half as good as the way she does in this epic movie."

I'm not sure if it is because I entered the theater with no expectations of a good movie based on DC's track record of ruining good classics, but this movie if anything gave Wonder Woman the name it deserved in this generation. Not to be an annoying feminist, but the superhero world of DC (and a little bit of marvel) lacks an amazing stand-out woman superhero like Wonder Woman who sets an ideal example for girls of all ages that ya don't need no man to be a powerful ""af"" God whipping bullet proof woman. Besides the fact that I left the theater feeling incredibly powerful, the humor in this movie was so tasteful, every sexual gag from Chris Pine to Gal Gadot was so freaking hilarious to me.

I did not find any inconsistencies at all with Wonder Woman. Yes it was a bit slow at first, but when compared to Batman vrs Superman it was like comparing quicksilver to molasses. Also I have to point out that IMDb needs to overhaul the rating system. Some people are giving this one star just to try to bring down the over all rating as quickly as possible. I can only hope that IMDb disregards these kind of sabotage attempts on their system.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman has just grossed more money at the box office in its 25th day of release than Man of Steel, BM vrs SM and Suicide Squad combined.

I thought it was a fun popcorn muncher. The opening scene of Diana's Amazonian roots and the weird battle with Germans who just happen to accidentally find their way through some sort of portal...is just not that compelling. <br/><br/>All these women who train all their lives to be these mystical warriors, doing flips and jumps...are no match for a bullet? I suppose they are supposed to be normal human women who can just leap 20 feet? It doesn't make much sense. <br/><br/>You have to wait almost an hour for the first good action scene, which is quite thrilling with Diana charging the world war 1 trenches.

And I love superhero movies. I even love them when they're slightly bad, because comic-books and what they stand for, is about having someone to look up to, someone to tell you you're not alone, someone to show you that you're not weird. <br/><br/>I am in no way an Amazon Goddess, but to be able to see this woman - someone I could see myself as, kick ass, - was incredible. And I'm not saying that easily.<br/><br/>I cried when we see a young Diana wanting to join in on the fighting. I cried when her aunt taught her to fight in secret, because she knew she should be able to. I cried when she talked back at men when she felt they were mistreating her, and I loved every line of ""No man has ever done that"" and then Diana showing them that she is not a man at all, she's Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>I've been waiting for a movie like this for forever, and I'm so sorry that people will see this and maybe not get it. The impact. I'm thinking it's going to be the same thing with Black Panther, and I will be rooting for that one as well.<br/><br/>I feel incredible proud of this movie, of the people behind it.

Similar time frame, similar story-line, bad guys, etc. I half expected them to bump into each other somewhere in the movie, lol...<br/><br/>Gal is very pretty, and that never hurts, but overall I found the entire plot a little flat.

"shobanchittuprolu","8","4","13","8 June 2017"," Wonder Woman is a must watch for Gal Gadot's stunning performance and action.
","Wonder Woman (2017):<br/><br/>Despite her status as a central member of the DC Trinity, Diana Prince/Wonder Woman is least popular in my gang back when I was a kid.I never expected a live screen version of Wonder Woman as I never cared about he role in Justice League.But my opinion entirely changed only because of Gal Gadot.Most of us will remember Gadot's scene-stealing appearance in the unfortunate Justice League prelude, Dawn of Justice.Standing firm against the DCEU's recent critical misfires, as well as the inherent risk of making a Wonder Woman standalone movie,fortunately Wonder Woman did a pretty good job.<br/><br/>Plot:<br/><br/>A young and wide-eyed Diana Prince lives in seclusion with Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielson), General Antiope (Robin Wright) and the rest of the Amazons of Themyscira, hidden away from the vengeful eye of Ares -- the God of Conflict. However, one day an American spy named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands in the waters off the shore of Paradise Island and informs the Amazons of the horrors of The Great War, and the distinct possibility that those horrors may one day reach Themyscira itself. Suspecting Ares as the cause of World War I, Diana joins Steve on a journey to the front to face off against the maniacal General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and the brilliant yet sadistic Doctor Poison (Elena Anaya) before they can unleash a new chemical weapon that will embroil the entire planet in endless war.<br/><br/>Plus Points:<br/><br/>1)Gal Gadot: Even now I wouldn't care about Wonder Woman if not for Gal Gadot.She is one of the most sexiest and cutest actress I have seen in recent times. Although the Israeli actress already proved herself as a scene-stealer in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, Wonder Woman allows her to deliver a far more complex and nuanced performance. Gadot shows a surprising level of deftness with the film's comedic moments and the battle scenes continue to show her as one of the most capable female action stars working today. She throws herself into the fight scenes, and the sheer amount of physicality on display in this film is far more than anyone could ever demand from a live-action Diana Prince. Gal Gadot IS Wonder Woman and we would definitely expect DC to make a lot of movies with her.<br/><br/>2)Music: Wonder Woman's another best part is its kick-ass theme music composed by Hans Zimmer.It is one of the best theme musics and its my current ringtone now.<br/><br/>3)Screenplay: Wonder Woman's screenplay may not have nothing special but Gal Gadot and Chris Pine's combo along with few light heart moments and some kick-ass action sequences,Wonder Woman is highly entertaining.<br/><br/>4)Chris Pine: Chris Pine delivered a mesmerizing performance as Steve Trevor with enough action,humor and innocence.<br/><br/>Minus Points:<br/><br/>1)Cliched Plot: Except with the use of war backdrop,Wonder Woman has clichÃ©d super hero plot.There will be no surprises and mostly a popcorn entertainment.<br/><br/>2)Lengthy Climax: The film's climax is yet another bloated CGI spectacle, and the film's central antagonist is almost entirely forgettable when compared to the charm and emotional depth of its heroes.Weak Villain is another con for this film.<br/><br/>So,Wonder Woman is a must watch for Gal Gadot's stunning performance and action.<br/><br/>My rating 7.5/10"

While she soars, the Writing never allows the narrative to remain consistently strong. Its entertaining, but far from amazing.<br/><br/>'Wonder Women' Synopsis: Before she was Wonder Woman she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained warrior. When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, she leaves home to fight a war to end all wars, discovering her full powers and true destiny.<br/><br/>'Wonder Woman' begins grippingly & holds well until our strong leading-lady comes to London with her Leading-Man (A Likable, Earnest Chris Pine) . But, soon after, the pace drops & gets sluggish. Also, despite some excellent action set-pieces, the film never Wow's you, as the Writing gets lazy. What starts off as an engaging origin story, suddenly becomes a regular Good versus Evil Fight. The villains lack the punch, so its all about upto the wondrous superwoman to keep it going.<br/><br/>And Gadot does it with spectacular success. I was mesmerized by Gadot's heroic turn, that is sure to send the audiences into a high. Gadot is a Star & is certainly here to stay. I can't wait to see her in the Justice League Movie, which opens later this year.<br/><br/>Allan Heinberg's Screenplay is super initially, but settles for regular stuff in its second-hour. Patty Jenkins's Direction is well-done. Graphics, expectedly, are extraordinary. And special mentions for the nicely done Cinematography by Matthew Jensen & the wonderfully done art & costume design. The Editing needed to be crisper. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Wonder Woman' is a Gal Gadot show all the way. Watch it for her & you'll be rewarded!"

The only movie based on a comic book or superhero that is worse than this is Batman v Superman. This is a close second to how bad that movie is, which is really saying something as that movie completely destroyed both Batman and Superman and made them into something neither of them are. Clearly all the hype for Wonder Woman is purely manufactured in order to attempt to save DC comics movies from total failure. However, after this, I don't have much hope left for them. Which is sad as I really hoped they could turn their movies around and finally produce something good.<br/><br/>The script is a complete rip off of the Captain America movie, with zero deviation from the overall plot, that you have to wonder if they're just going to start copying Marvel.

Hopefully, we are not relying on the obesity civilization to guarantee our continuity, but they certainly spit video material at awesome speed.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman was once a little innocent girl living in a paradise island inhabited by more women who constantly train in makeshift hand to hand combat.

That was a poor casting decision - even the CGI couldn't get me to believe he was an all-powerful god.<br/><br/>Additionally, I couldn't figure out the ""truth"" about Diana that her aunt and mother kept talking about. Even after watching the whole movie, I had to come here to read the synopsis to figure out that plot line.<br/><br/>In terms of Diana's arc, there were missed opportunities from the beginning. When she accidentally created the power expulsion from her arm braces near the beginning, better plot exposition could have been done to keep the audience hungry. Instead, I was waiting for the whole dang movie for her to do it again as some big reveal. Nope.<br/><br/>I know in the comics world, it's a friendly rivalry between Marvel & DC. As a writer myself, I believe the MCU team has done a better job crafting their stories individually, and intertwining them, and making their fantasies believable. When you compare this with other strong female characters and their motivations/development (Captain Marvel, Agent Carter, Okoye, Nakia, Shuri, Maria Hill, Black Widow, Valkyrie to name a few), this movie doesn't do it for me.<br/><br/>Litmus test: I won't be buying it."

"matthewjloller","8","3","9","14 August 2019"," Close to a masterpiece but not quite
","Wonder Woman is a gritty war film with a central conflict not between the hero and a villain, but between the hero and an idea, and the movie is so much better for it. For the majority of the run time, Diana must try to discover whether Arese or man's nature is behind the war of the world. This conflict forces Diana to go through a full character arc while facing many physical threats as well. Chris Pine is also a welcome addition as his character has some of the best moments in the movie. Unfortunately, the movie does not know how quite to end. Due to the lack of a dominant physical threat, the movie has to force one in at the end making for a sloppy third act, but the first two are done so well it easily makes up for it, and a few emotional beats salvage the end so that the audience is still left with a positive response to the film."

","I SHOULD like this movie. But I really don't.<br/><br/>I believe that equality between sexes shouldn't even be a question. It should be like oxygen. It's there but it is so normal that people just don't care about it.<br/><br/>I despise those who say a person should be less because of his gender or look. That is completely insane.
I support the #MeToo movement because that is a geniune problem in this world. Men having power over women just because of their sexuality. <br/><br/>But, there is something I hate even more! People who think of this as an opportunity for stardom and fame.
They don't help the cause they just use their sexuality (the same way as men did and still does) to reach their goals and that is just as insane as people like Weinstein.<br/><br/>You don't use your sexuality for anything in your career. You use your talent, your brain, your logic.<br/><br/>So when I see another dumb movie about a person with superpowers I won't say anything good about about just because that person happens to be a woman. It doesn't matter. If it's a good movie it will stay as one no matter the gender, skin color. If I don't like the movie I won't change my mind just because instead of seeing Superman do stuff in an illogical and boring movie I see Wonder Woman doing the same thing.<br/><br/>So yeah, i am completely for equality. In my life, I don't even talk about it really, because I never understood how it even matters. All people are people. It is so obvious I really don't know how is it possible that we are still having this problem.<br/><br/>But, then again, I won't say anything nice about a movie I didn't like just so that I can be politically correct."

","If potatoes could feel, they'd cried over this movie. If tomatoes could speak, they'd shouted over this movie. If all men had a brain, they'd never ever watched such wasteful garbage. <br/><br/>I deeply feel as I'm being fooled by a bunch of bad made CGI and an actress, who most probably got this role, because she is nice and sexy, but possesses in no way, any kind of acting abilities. Basically, all she does all the movie is to pose in front of camera with shoulders wide, getting into jump mode with one knee bent etc etc. I mean, do men don't see enough beautiful women nowadays, so even the movie actresses must be beautiful and sexy to attract people to the theaters? <br/><br/>Beside that, the only positive thing about this movie is Chris Pine. Without him, I'd stood up and left the theater. <br/><br/>Expect to watch absolutely no character built up, no worthy dialogues, no real fights, even if it is a fantasy film, it all makes no sense at all. Two villains who come out of nowhere with no real background or any story behind. They suddenly get killed like they're not important at all. I mean, come on, give us something to enjoy. I'd watch Baywatch, if it's all about seeing a sexy woman acting like a super hero!"
"p-jonsson","8","3","9","2 November 2017"," Good entertainment if you brain is tired.
","I quite enjoyed this movie. When I learned that Zack Snyder had his fingers in it I got a worried since he recently wrote such atrocities as Batman vs Superman and sure enough the story is a really the weakest part of the movie. A typical nonsensical, unintelligent, Hollywood story/script were you are better off putting your brain in idle when watching it.<br/><br/>However it makes up for this with cool special effects and, surprisingly, quite enjoyable characters. This is definitely a movie that you watch for the sake of the special effects. Well, if you are a male teenager you might also be watching it to drool over Gal Gadot of course (I have to admit that she is hot).<br/><br/>There is not too much to say about the plot. Our Amazon hot chick discovers that there is a war going on and goes out to stop it. Since she has been overly protected by her guardian she is amazingly clueless about life outside of her little island. Especially aspects involving men. Something which creates some funny moments as well as some embarrassingly silly ones. This, Diana's gradual evolution where she not only is learning about life but also discovers her considerable powers, is one of the enjoyable aspects of the movie though. It is of course also one of the dummer aspects of the movie. How the f could the Amazon Queen race Diana to be so ignorant about everything?<br/><br/>Another not so enjoyable part of the movie is the ludicrous scenes where the britts are trying to obtain peace at all costs as well as the stereotypical portrayal of Ludendorff as some megalomaniacal, half crazy war-mongerer. This was just dumb. I guess Zac Snyder just picked the name out of some history book without bothering to read up on the character. Typical lack of intelligence and respect, a la Hollywood, for anything outside of their, very limited, sphere of knowledge. Well, at least Danny Huston did a pretty decent job of the shitty role he was given. So did most of the rest of actors. I definitely liked Gal Gadot as Super Woman but then, although I am not a teenager, I am still a male so maybe I am biased when it comes to her?<br/><br/>I definitely liked the special effects. The showdown at the end was great as far as I am concerned and the rest not bad either. They could have been even better though if it would not have been so obvious that the Germans where mostly incompetent extras waiting for Wonder Woman to show off her gymnastics and slow motion abilities. Come on, even superhero special effects should make some pretense of being ""realistic"" superhero special effects.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely aimed at the young adult segment. Unfortunately it do not seem to know what it is aiming for. Sometimes it is almost adult, sometimes it is late teen and sometimes just so bloody TV-show silly that you're wondering if it is aiming for even pre-teens.<br/><br/>Anyway, regardless of its faults I did enjoy my 2+ hour spent on this movie. Enough to give it a 4 out of 5 rating"

I have to say I wasn't very impressed by how the story unfolded but I did like how they presented the comic book hero, it gives us some insight as to who she is and some foresight with what to expect in future movies starring our amazon goddess. All in all the movie was well directed, the acting and actors were more than good and some scenes even gave me some goosebumps.<br/><br/>If you like the comics, if you like the hero, if you like Gal Gadot then you will surely at least enjoy watching the movie.

"MovieSoup","3","3","9","6 September 2017"," Awful but a step in the right direction
","Thanks to movies like Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman the DC universe is known for its SH*T high budget flops that ooze product placement and awful plots. So I was not expecting anything going into this movie and was prepared to waste 2 hours of my life sitting watching a train wreck of a film.<br/><br/>I was, however, a bit surprised when I watched Wonder Woman as it had some half decent scenes in it. The character interaction between Gadot and pine was believable and surprisingly charming. As well as some of the other characters too. For instance Charlie and Sammy are actually semi decent characters who have a few gags and are given something to do in the film. <br/><br/>The plot, however, is really boring and falls short many times. Wonder woman suspects that Ares, god of war, is behind WW1 and goes to fight him while trying to find out who she really is. See how I just described the plot in 25 wordsthat's how simple and boring it is! There are no lessons learned and no real issues dealt with in the 2 hour time frame.<br/><br/>There is a point near the end of the movie where I thought there would be a moral message about war being caused by bad people and not gods. Wonder Woman had just killed a guy who she thought was Ares and theWW1 did not stop because the god of war was ""dead"". Chris Pine says that maybe it was not Ares that started the WW1 but just bad people who want to do bad things.<br/><br/>This would have deviated from the norm of having a big boss battle at the end, like in all superhero movies. It would have led to a great message about the evils of humans and I would have applauded it for doing something different. Instead Wonder Woman had to fight Ares and cause as much destruction as possible. So yeah a bit disappointed that they had a chance to do something different but instead took the easy way out with a big CGI action scene. <br/><br/>In fact the action scenes in this movie are pretty poor considering Zack Snyder was attached to this film. Don't get me wrong he is a fu**ing Sh*t director, and I hate that I share a name with him, but he does put effort into his visuals at least. The director for this, Patty Jenkins, just cannot direct a good action scene. The fight scenes are just not interesting to watch and feel slow paced even though it is something dynamic happening in the scene. <br/><br/>To her credit she is much better at character interactions than Snyder. This is clear if you see the interactions between Gadot and Pine in this film, and then compare it with Superman and Lois Lane in BvS. I guarantee that you will see that BvS has the weaker character acting because the director is terrible at getting the best out of his actors on set and only cares about visuals and product placement. <br/><br/>The music for this film is garbage. The Wonder Woman score music that is like her theme song is jarring and annoying. The whole point of a song in a movie is to make you feel a connection to the character or scene you are watching. Wonder Woman's theme music completely takes me out of what's happening every time I heard it.<br/><br/>The actual look of the movie was better than previous DC films. In this they actually tried colour in some shots and not underexpose everything in an attempt to create atmosphere. The editing whilst having a few continuity errors was good as well and certainly better than other DC films. <br/><br/>All in all is Wonder Woman a good movieNO. The plot is boring, the action scenes are boring and the music is boring. No amount of good character interaction is going to make me feel that this movie is good. If DC took the character development of this movie and put together a coherent plot around it, with some good action scenes they would have a great movie. This movie is crap but is a step in the right direction."

","Let me start with a simple reminder in order for a movie to be decent it must have an excellent cast a story line easy to follow and still intrigue the audience and last to make the movie even better it must have a plot twist no one sees coming. <br/><br/>Wonder woman had all that from a great group of cast who each character you enjoyed and some you couldn't wait get taken off. Gal portrayed a wonderful wonder woman from Batman vs Superman so I knew she would slay this movie. <br/><br/>The story line was rather exceptional beginning with the origin of Diana and learning of her people's history they did great on not staying completely focused on her history and quickly moved to all the action and learning of her potential <br/><br/>The biggest thing that won me over though besides great story line and many comedic moments is the big plot twist no none could of seen coming. We spend the entire movie knowing the main villains is Ares yet we are convinced it's the German general working with Dr poison. However after a quick defeat and Diana kills the general I was left confused and realized that maybe someone else was Ares and moments later a character who appeared early on was the villain no one seen coming<br/><br/>And a jam pact fight scene and a heroic death this movie truly changed my view on it."
"bowmanblue","8","3","9","20 July 2017"," Wonder Woman – DC finally finds its feet
","In case you're not aware of the 'shared cinematic universe' wars that are going on in the cinemas, I'll try and put it simply. One studio makes superhero films that everyone seems to love. Another studio makes superhero films that you'd think the same audience would loves, but everyone seems to hate. And there you have my brief history of 'Marvel' and 'DC.' Wonder Woman falls into the 'DC bracket' and fans have already expressed their disapproval with DC's previous attempts at getting all their most famous heroes together on the big screen with the various Superman and Suicide Squad films, some even saying that DC's 'shared cinematic universe' is already dead in the water. However, just when it looked like this franchise was as dead as the new General Zod, along comes Gal Gadot as the titular Wonder Woman. And, just as most people agreed that the other DC films don't work, now most people seem to agree that Wonder Woman is awesome! I have to say that I agree, but then maybe I'm easily pleased as I also really liked Batman versus Superman and Suicide Squad! I've never read the comics, but I believe the film is a little different here and there. Apparently, they've changed her origins and set the story in World War I as opposed to WWII. Apparently, that did irk some people, but my lack of backstory knowledge of the source material meant that I never noticed! Anyway, we meet Diana (aka Wonder Woman) on her Amazonian island as a child. We see her obsess over becoming like the warrior women she idolises and yearns to join them in their eternal fight against the forces of darkness. Don't worry. This doesn't last for long. It's pretty tedious and definitely the low-point of the whole film. In fact, it could quite easily have been cut and no one would have really noticed. All it feels like is pointless exposition. However, like I say, it doesn't last long and Diana quickly grows up in time to rescue crashed Allied fighter pilot Captain Kirk from his stricken plane as it nose dives in the sea (or rather Chris Pine, anyway).<br/><br/>And from then on it's pretty non-stop. You have everything you can want from a superhero movie. Despite Gal Gadot's inexperience with acting (I believe she's primarily a model), she plays the character perfectly. She's one part fish out of water as she arrives in the 'real' world and interacts with people who weren't raised without war on a paradise island. But she's never totally naïve. You cannot help but root for her as she's just so damn likable without ever been a goody-two-shoes. Then there's the chemistry with Kirk – sorry, Pine – they bounce off each other brilliantly. And the characters are seamlessly woven into expert direction when it comes to the fight scenes – after all, Wonder Woman is literally going to war and the scene where she charges an entire German trench sends goosebumps down your arms – it's that good.<br/><br/>If there is a negative it's the beginning, plus an annoying comedy relief character (you'll spot her straight away), but thankfully both bad elements are brief. This is normally the point where I say that fans of superhero movies will love this. And, although I believe that to be true, I reckon that Wonder Woman is the kind of film where pretty much anyone who enjoys good cinema should enjoy it, plus – special shout-out to the weird grinding soundtrack that seems to come on every time Diana fights (it's weird and definitely as memorable to the action as other classic tunes such as the Bond and Indiana Jones themes).<br/><br/>After a shaky start DC are finally off and running. And this can only be good to give Marvel a bit of competition at the Box Office. Bring on Wonder Woman 2 (or was that technically Batman versus Superman?!)."

"crybabystinkypoo","6","3","9","30 June 2017"," Some criticism(s)
","Wonder Woman's home isn't explained; with Superman it was straightforward; General Zod and Superman came from another planet but in Wonder Woman it's a zone that you cross in and out of. Why had no one, a sailor for instance, discovered Wonder Woman's island before? You might think I'm nitpicking but it's lazy writing and bad storytelling. Also, I reckon the writers got the idea from 'Time Bandits' (1981). When the pilot and Wonder Woman get to London (which looked awesome) there's this questionable clothes shopping scene; Wonder Woman cloaked in black seemed to be blending in; concealing her sword and shield just fine without having to change into civilian clothes. Also, the scene where the pilot, Wonder Woman and friends are sitting around the campfire before getting to the Western Front; it seemed out of place, like it should've been left in the editing room. Which brings me to the red haired lady, the Scottish sniper and the Indian chief; I found them annoying, like the writers were following standard procedure 'now it's time to introduce friends and allies'. And those sped up/slowed down leaps and kicks; great directors like Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese don't do this. Then there was that heavy metal/guitar music used in 'Batman vs Superman'; I was hoping that since the first half of Wonder Woman was free of this horrible music, it would be left out. And the evil chemist lady who wore a mask concealing part of her face; I reckon the writers got the idea from the 1989 'Batman' film; the Joker's girlfriend had something similar to cover her disfigured face. Wonder Woman had it's moments, for instance the beginning e.g. the Zeus/Aries story (artfully done) and when Diana's growing up and training to become Wonder Woman. And Wonder Woman's island was nice to look at; worth seeing for that, plus the other sets. And the battle scene where Wonder Woman crosses no man's land was good. And Aries's armor looked good, as did the other costumes. You'll probably see Wonder Woman. And it will make/is making lots of money. I think people were expecting Wonder Woman be a silly (like 'Captain America') but it was better than expected. But it wasn't that good either. Technically/production wise Wonder Woman was very good. With a better script, more editing/better pacing; dropping the heavy metal music and those slowed down/sped up fights, Wonder Woman could've been wonderful."

","Personally, I'm not really a fan of DC, I do watch DC movies, but Marvel is my favorite, this review may be a bit bias, it could be a 8/10 for some people, but for me it's a 7/10.<br/><br/>Story: 7/10<br/><br/>The movie starts off with Diana (Wonder Woman) as a child, and you watch her grow up to an adult. She was sculpted out of clay by her mother, and she is an Amazonian warrior, she later sees Steve Trevor crash land in the ocean, and she saves him from drowning, the Amazonian warriors find him and question him. Wonder Woman leaves with Steve Trevor to fight in world war 2, the only reason why she fought was because she wanted to kill Ares. The story is very cliché, and there is some bits that is kind of stupid or unnecessary.<br/><br/>Characters: 9/10<br/><br/>Diana: Diana is an amazonian warrior and is the daughter of the queen, I think she is a good character because of how naive she is, and Gal Gadot does a fantastic job.<br/><br/>Steve Trevor: Steve is pretty cliché, he's the average hero of any other movie, but Chris Pine plays the role amazingly.<br/><br/>Ludendorff: Ludendorff is one of many bad guys, he's the weakest of the three, he's so average it's painful.<br/><br/>Ares: Ares is the god of war, i'm guessing he can shape shift and have telekinesis powers, which I don't think Ares has those abilities, but it's a fantasy movie, so i'll give it the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>Sameer: Sameer isn't really crucial to the story, he's just there to be a member of the team.<br/><br/>Dr. Maru: Dr. Maru is a strong bad guy even though she's not that important, she is interesting and unique.<br/><br/>Action: 9/10<br/><br/>The movie takes a while to get to the action, but when it does, it's entertaining, the movie has great gun fights, and the final fight was amazing, one of the best boss fight iv'e seen in a while. There are some points in the movie when the physics are a bit off, which kind of ruins the action, but overall good action.<br/><br/>Wonder is a good movie, recently DC has been doing poorly in their movies, but now we have a movie that is actually good. I recommend this movie to anyone, it's a solid entertaining superhero movie."

"Laakbaar","7","3","9","16 June 2017"," ""Magnificent as she is""
","I've been thinking a lot about this movie since I saw it. If you had told me a month ago that I would go to (never mind enjoy) a Wonder Woman movie, I would have written you off as bonkers. And yet that's what has happened. I enjoyed this movie, although there were some aspects of it that I didn't buy.<br/><br/>This movie is about female empowerment v. male violence (represented here by the Great War). Diana v. Ares. Much of the fun of the film was in seeing Diana experience the modern world (well, the world a century ago) and seeing whether her idealism would crack under the weight of reality.<br/><br/>I liked Wonder Woman, played by Gal Gadot. She was indeed ""magnificent"" (as Ludendorff needlessly points out to the viewers), a shining light. Diana is propelled into an extraordinary adventure, and yet handles everything that comes her way. It is an important mission that gives her society, her family and her life meaning. There was a lot to enjoy here, including her formation, her beliefs, her innocence and idealism, her determination, her shock at the modern world. Just awesome.<br/><br/>They did a great job in showing how WW could work as a superhero. I just had not bought into it before (shield? lasso? bracelets? -- c'mon). But they made it work. Some real cleverness there.<br/><br/>One major theme in this movie is female athleticism. It's not just women engaged in, um, ancient Greek martial arts though. (In this regard, it's similar to ""The 100"".) I really have no idea how they do it, but the result is spectacular. I suppose it's a combination of martial arts, gymnastics, choreography, CGI animation and cinematography. Once it is all combined for the viewer on the screen, the result is exciting and appealing.<br/><br/>These were powerful women, portrayed (as far as I know) in a way never shown on the screen before. It felt new and different, although I suppose it's what we see now in Crossfit competitions and shows like Steve Austin's Broken Skull Ranch. For anyone who hasn't seen these things, I'm sure the depiction in this movie was mind-blowing. Showing this aspect of the movie in a convincing way must have been a huge undertaking on the part of the filmmakers. I think this was successful.<br/><br/>Another important theme in the movie is the Great War. This is a war most of us don't hear about much anymore. We've all seen the historical footage and historical movies attempting to show it to us. I'm not sure the movie was accurate in depicting this war as genocidal and oriented at mass destruction. It wasn't, was it? This bothered me. <br/><br/>The portrayal of the war here was different than one I'm used to. This movie attempts to show it in a way that is relevant to its theme (""Ares must be destroyed"") and interesting to modern internet-generation viewers (especially those demanding action). Whether this depiction of the Great War was successful I am less certain, but they get an ""A"" for effort.<br/><br/>I didn't like the Trevor character. I blame the writing and story here. His job was to be the foil to Diana, and most of it didn't work for me. It didn't help that I'm generally not into Chris Pine. I think Pine was given a very tough role here. There is a lot more I could say about this, but I will refrain.<br/><br/>I didn't buy Capt Trevor's little gang of misfits on the front. Sorry, but I just didn't feel they belonged on the front or in the movie. When they were on, I played on my phone.<br/><br/>Ares was ""meh"".<br/><br/>This is the thing: I feel that this movie had some tedious aspects and some awesome aspects. Yes, the two themes were dealt with in a camp way -- how else could you deal with it in a Wonder Woman movie? -- but I admired the effort. This movie is worth about 7.5."
"vborn","8","3","9","16 June 2017"," A movie you're supposed to watch with heart
","As I said this is a very emotional movie and they did great in making the people see the world in Wonder Woman's perspective. It gets emotionally deeper and deeper. I'm sure after seeing this movie the decision of WW to come back will be more delightful for everyone. <br/><br/>Don't listen to people who watched this movie with brain and didn't even try to get entertained. I don't want to offend you. This movie might be too slow-paced and too incomplete for you. Then it's just not your type of movie and that's okay. But please don't act like you're more intelligent than people, who liked the movie, because this has nothing to do with intelligence. I'll come later to this point. <br/><br/>So what's beautiful about this movie besides the emotional value? Again the background score was good and sometimes you didn't notice it's not Hans Zimmer. The acting of Gal Gadot as Diana was great. Some might not like to character of Wonder Woman, but that has nothing to do with the performance of her, since she has embodied the naive Diana in the way she should be for this movie. I liked the character ""Steve"" as well. He was responsible for creating an inner fight with yourself combined with the perspective of WW. It resulted into a great message. <br/><br/>Still it's not a masterpiece in my eyes. CGI wasn't bad enough to get distracted, but still it could have been better sometimes. The action scenes in Act III could have been better, too. It was kind of an exaggerated superpower fight. And just like that there have been few little negative points, that makes the movie worse than before, when you keep thinking about that.<br/><br/>Still it's a great movie, if you watch it like it should be watched. It totally makes you understand the mind of WW, although she has a very different thinking.<br/><br/>The following point is directional towards the points some negative critics have mentioned. So this will definitely contain SPOILER!<br/><br/>I read that people wanted to see how Diana became Wonder Woman. Well, that's the way she became Wonder Woman. She was born with/as a superpower. Why should Synder change that, just because it's different in other superhero movies? A director does NOT write a superhero movie, because the best way to make a superhero movie is to not make a superhero movie. <br/><br/>Some claimed that the decisions of characters were stupid, e.g. Steve had many other options to save and not to die. Well, that's what I mean with watching with heart! There are always plenty of safer decisions. But a character make his decision in a dramatic situation without thinking much about the logic. And on top of that Steve was proud to save many people by giving up his life. Try to understand it, because if you think about the logic and not the desire and feelings of the character, you shouldn't watch any movie.<br/><br/>Some said it's stupid how the Germans are treated like cartoon villains and the Britians are treated like the best people in the world. People who have claimed that didn't even understand the main aspect of this movie. This wanted to show the perspective of WW. And her naive thinking is that there is a good and bad side, which is why it's shown in the same way first. If you did watch the movie, you should actually understand that the movie point out that the Britians and actually every other nation is responsible for all the suffer, too. There is actually one scene extra for this. The one, when the chief said that the Britians have destroyed his native country. Actually this is the main message of the movie, that everything has a good and a bad side. <br/><br/>There are plenty of other critics, where you only have to think with heart and not with the brain. You don't watch a movie to find mistakes. You watch a movie to get entertained. Just as I said it: You don't have to like it, it's not a movie for everyone. But please don't act like you're more intelligent than other people, because this movie isn't about intelligence."
"nick_ribb","8","3","9","14 June 2017"," My review of Wonder Woman
","My review of Wonder Woman consists of a few ideas. First is that out of all the super hero(Marvel/DC) movies that have come out in the past 5 years, it has had one of the most understandable plots as far as the realistic aspect of the film gives. Although the Amazonian's are not a real culture and their culture is superficial, as are most superhero films, she follows her destiny to help the human race as well as facing her problems that are set out for her by finding Aries and killing him to bring balance to everything, including her people. Overall it inspires you to believe in Wonder Woman as a protagonist and it gives you hope to what she will accomplish in the future."
"wanglum","7","3","9","12 June 2017"," Not disappointed but not good enough
","I am a wonder woman fan. I loved the TV show and having another person be the wonder woman is weird but inevitable. She is likable in this movie. Chris is also okay but I guess he is not coming back. I just don't think the God was picked the right person. If he was kind looking but at the end shows the evil side I think it will be more interesting. I really like Wonder woman's mom. She does look like the part. The part where Steve was dancing with Diana was too cheesy..and then went into a room together? wow what are you suggesting? I enjoy the effects. There are times that I believe it is not possible to move certain way. It is sad to say there are things should have been better. I love the part where WW's mom told the goddesses story, that part is really pretty."
"danielharden","8","3","9","12 June 2017"," Wonder Woman: The First Avenger
","If you have followed the DC extended universe like I have, you would know that it's the cinema equivalent of a delayed flight. It just hasn't gotten itself off the ground yet. Man of Steel had a mixed reception (I personally liked it) while Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad were simply bad films. Fortunately this isn't the case for Wonder Woman that has not only managed commercial success, but has gotten both critics and commercial audiences to do something almost unheard of in the world of film... Positively agree. Wonder Woman is the take off the delayed flight that is the DCEU needed, and boy was it needed.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is by far the best DCEU film and this is thanks to Patty Jenkins's brilliant direction. It's been 14 years since Jenkins brought us the very human account of America's first female serial killer, Aileen Wuornos, in the fantastic film that is Monster. Its surprising how long its been since Jenkins did a feature film, but fortunately she hasn't lost her footing with this considerably larger film. Jenkins's greatest success with this film, to me lies in the way she empowers women and handles the characters in this film. Yes this is a feminist film, or at least a film feminists can enjoy, but it doesn't mean men can't enjoy the film either. Wonder Woman doesn't empower woman at the expense of men's masculinity, but instead presents both men and women as equal which must be a film first and is extremely refreshing to see.<br/><br/>The film is also visually stunning and surprisingly full of colour, as opposed to the previous three entries to the DCEU. Patty Jenkins finds this sweet spot as the film is paced in such a way as to move quickly and so not to bore audiences, but also slow enough for relationships and characters to develop. Wonder Woman still maintains the DC style established by Zack Snyder in Man of Steel and Batman V Superman, with slo mo speed up action scenes and metallic colour tones, this further express' Jenkins's unbelievable directing, as she is able to make Wonder Woman her own, while also staying true to the traits of the DCEU franchise thus far. I feel Wonder Woman had a lot to prove, with Ghostbusters last year and the failure of live action, female superhero films such as; Elektra, Catwoman and Supergirl. So I'm very pleased that Wonder Woman is a film about a woman, directed by a talented woman, starring a talented actress, and is actually a really good film. The film and those involved have definitely proved themselves/itself even if it/they shouldn't have had to.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the next person who should be praised for Wonder Woman, and that is Gal Gadot. Gal Gadot does as Michael Keaton and Heath Ledger did before her, took quite a bit of criticism when initially cast in a superhero film, and then proved the naysayers wrong. Gadot plays Diana Prince with an air of childlike naivety and optimism that really warms you to her, and makes her reminiscent of other heroes you love like Superman and Captain America. Chris Pine is also good in this film, playing more than just the male love interest role and actually being as much of an asset as Diana in this story. The two have a good on screen relationship which, although could have benefited from slightly better dialogue or just something that's a little more mature, the two manage to make the best of it and make a believable pair.<br/><br/>Although this film was very good there are some flaws within it. The film is intertextual to other superhero films such as when Diana deflects the bullet in the alley way, as well as the revolving door scene, both of which being references to Christopher Reeves' Superman. I don't have an issue with this reference, however, the film feels very similar to Captain America: First Avenger in several ways; the character of our hero, the World War setting, the real life German soldier villain, the colour palette/ visual style etc. Although Wonder Woman is, in my own opinion, miles better than First Avenger, I can't help but feel the studio is attempting to copy it. Thankfully Patty Jenkins makes the best of this, making Wonder Woman her own. Secondly, although I enjoyed the pacing and relationship of Steve and Diana, I do feel that the film, and their relationship, lacked a little bit of depth. The film is fast moving and their relationship is believable, but I feel that they just reach the minimum amount of depth and development required for the film to be considered good, and so would like to hopefully get a little bit more out of them... But then again I may be being unfair. Finally, there are a lot of unanswered questions at the end of the film, such as; how come she doesn't seem to age in the human world yet aged in the Themyscira? The comics will have the answers to the questions I'm sure, but not everyone is aware/ has read/ has the time to read the comics. However I will give the film the benefit of the doubt that it may explain things in future films.<br/><br/>To conclude, Wonder Woman is the best DCEU film and the first good female lead superhero film. Handled phenomenally by a used-to-be-underrated director and with great acting performances from Chris Pine and Gal Gadot, Wonder Woman is a solid origin story that incorporated it's feminist messages correctly. Although some aspects remain unexplained, the depth of the film is merely passable, and the last act verges on the cusp of being too CGI heavy, Wonder Woman is able to overpower and overshadow its minor flaws with the mountains of good it was able to achieve. I wanted this film to be good and thank goddess it was."

"mr_bickle_the_pickle","7","3","9","10 June 2017"," Fun, but a bit over-hyped
","I enjoyed the film a lot more than the other DCEU movies. That being said, it was a bit over-hyped. The story fell a little flat to me. It was fairly predictable (I could tell who Ares really was as soon as that character came on screen). Steve's secretary (honestly don't even remember her name) was so one note. She obviously was written in to be some comic relief but she just didn't end up feeling real. Like for instance, Steve (who was presumed dead) shows up with a strange woman, and she just doesn't question it. Not too mention that whole scene in general was silly to me. Steve has made it clear that getting this notebook back to his superior is incredibly important, so why waste time making Diana try on a bajillion dresses. I mean, I know its to have a funny scene where Diana rips a dress as she tries to fight in them, but it just doesn't make sense in context of the movie. I will say though that I did like the war scenes. I felt like it accurately portrayed what war would have felt like back then. The desperation, the pain, the fear in people's eyes. And I also liked that the film had elements of PTSD in there. It brought another layer of realism in there. Those were some aspects of the story I appreciated.<br/><br/>The CGI was lackluster. Certainly not the worst thing ever, but there was a number of times where it looked fairly obvious they were standing in front of a green screen. And they overused the slo-mo in fight scenes.<br/><br/>I know this review seems fairly negative, but honestly the film was still really entertaining. And I do appreciate seeing more women driven films, and specifically women superheroes. I just don't think its some huge game changer that people are making it out to be."
"Ingrouille181","7","3","9","9 June 2017"," Not a Savior for the DCEU, but a good start
","I didn't know what I wanted to expect from a Wonder Woman movie. I wasn't impressed by Gal Gadot in Batman v Superman, and the WWI setting put me off. But the more I thought of it, it was a perfect setting. The only Wonder Woman movie I'd seen up to that point was the 2009 animated film, and all it felt like was anti-male propaganda, so waiting for a live-action movie about the character, especially in a WWII setting, I was cringing at how much it would jump on the man- hating band wagon. But to my surprise, the DCEU decided to have a more mature approach, it's not about men-kind, it's about mankind, and explores one of the world's chosen saviors, an Amazon, exploring man's world and discovering there's more to it than simply bad and good; that everyone can have shades of gray to them. I like the cast, some more than others, with Gadot making a decent portrayal as Diana, and Chris Pine doing a good job as Trevor.<br/><br/>So Diana, princess of the Amazons, leaves with Steve Trevor in order to end the war before the villains, general Ludendorff and Doctor Poison, can release a deadly toxin that will kill millions of others, creating a war that never ends. Diana is set on defeating Ludendorff, whom she believes to be the god of war himself, Ares. Along the way, Diana and Steve put together a group of soldiers to help them fight. I really like the action in this movie, and my favorite segment has to be when Diana steps over the trenches, choosing to do something instead of allowing the fight to continue.<br/><br/>As for negatives, I do have one thing; the portrayal of the villains. I have no problem with with Ludendorff and Maru, AKA Doctor Poison. My problem lies in the fact that, the German army are portrayed as the deadly villains. Watching the movie again, it occurred to me that the people of Germany, and the country itself, was forced into the war. It was different in WWII as they WERE the bad guys; the SS, the Nazi's, of course they were the bad guys. I just wish the would have portrayed how the people of Germany we're in those days; just like the British and the French, the Germans were just as much people who we're forced to fight, and without the obvious bad guy and their destructive plan, I feel like had a German crash landed on Themyscira instead at the beginning, Diana would have been fighting with the Germans instead. Looking through the group Diana and Steve put together, I just wished there could have been a German guy in there as well, to show that gray area that they had to fight. It's a good mix of characters too, and shows how things were in those days.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed this movie, and I think the director Patty Jenkins handled the story and setting well, I just wish it handled portraying the gray area there was in that war. I also wished they had left the Ares fight at the end to another movie instead using it for the cliché end fight between the hero and villain."

","DCEU, after 2 disastrous movies has finally got a movie and a star other than Batman that they can build around. Patty Jenkins Wonder Woman played by Gal Gadot is a thrill ride that lives up to the hype. I have been very critical of the first 2 DCEU movies and came in to this one hoping that they would give Wonder Woman some justice after she helped save Superman v Batman. The origin story of Wonder Woman has always fascinated me and they give you her beginnings in this movie. While I would like to have seen more of the story focused on this aspect they did an excellent job of setting the stage with the time they had. Gal Gadot gets an A+ for her performance as Wonder Woman. She brought to that character a brilliant balance of; honor, duty, imagination and strength all while adhering to an innocence that made her that much more likable. It was a refreshing portrayal of an iconic hero that allowed me to simply enjoy without the rhetoric of sexism, racism and all the complaining in the world. Chris Pine also gets an A+ for his role as Steve. I applaud him for setting aside his ego and playing the 2nd lead to Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. As for the negatives or things I did not agree with. There is a stolen plot from a MCU movie in the finale act that I would have went in a different direction. More emphasis on her home island and there was one antagonist who was misused. Other than that Wonder Woman is a great movie to see while in theaters and will not leave you disappointed."

"AnishMisra","9","3","9","6 June 2017"," Wonder Woman review
","Wonder Woman is a film directed by Patty Jenkins. I saw all the 4 trailers of the film and had high hopes. But still there was a part in me that was scared for this film since we didn't get some impressive films from the DC Extended Universe. But man, I breathed relief as I came out of the hall.<br/><br/>Plot: Diana, an Amazonian from Themysciara decides to go to the outside world to defeat Ares and restore peace in the world.<br/><br/>Story and direction: The story was as good as it got. The woman director move by Zac Snyder (who happens to be the story writer and producer of the film) was great. Although I had my reservations (Patty has directed only one film- Monster that was not a commercial film), but they were all cleared few minutes into the film. I could see the film go wrong in many ways but I guess the sailor of the ship (ie director) was apt. The first act was kind of slow. But yes we needed that to strengthen Diana as a character. The second act is where we get a sense of comedy, as Diana trying to understand what is happening around her. It could have become way absurd with the comedy. But thank god, that didn't happen. We get to see characters fleshed out so nicely. We see Steve's friends who are actually in the horrors of war or who don't want to be a part of the war but have to be due to some reason. The third act is where actually most of the action happens, which was phenomenal. The only problem I had was actually with the main villain: Ares. There was a tension, frustration, etc.. But I wanted more of that. Even the General taking some kind of drug to increase his strength, I saw no use actually in that.<br/><br/>Acting: Gal Gadot was par excellence in her role as Wonder Woman. I couldn't picture any other actress for this role. The fierceness needed for the role was there in her. Hats Off!!!. Chris Pine will be loved by me for the role of Steve Trevor (although I still don't understand his ""multi picture deal"" thing). Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright were good as Hippolyta and Antiope respectively. David Thewelis as Sir Patrick Morgan was good (Love him as Varga in Fargo) but he was so so in Ares. I wished to see a much younger actor for the role of Ares.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: I guess it would be where Steve expresses his love for Diana before going on a flight full of gas canisters. That was kind of intense for me.<br/><br/>Verdict: This film although not fully perfect but has instilled in me that there is hope for the extended Dc Universe. I am rooting for the Justice League (given the fact that 2 Directors are giving their contributions to this film). Go enjoy this film. I can assure you it will not be a disappointing experience.<br/><br/>I give it a 9/10."
"maurice_yacowar","7","3","9","5 June 2017"," Diana Prince saves mankind from WW I Germany with help from male Brit.
","A package from Bruce Wayne sets this narrative going. That adds a popular culture level of mythology to the original two: the life of the gods and the life of mortals. In the former our heroine was born when Zeus infused life into the clay doll her mother had shaped. In the latter the Amazonians live their man-free warrior existence in splendid isolation until discovered (attacked) by German soldiers at the end of WW I. <br/><br/>Of course Diana Prince (WW) bridges all three mythologies. Her evil counterpart only is Ares, the god of war, who visits earth in the opposing bodies of the German officer and the British traitor. War transcends religion, politics and philosophies because the murderous spirit is innate in all of us, the option that the better eschew. This Ares steps into the comic mythology when he becomes a shape-shifting Transformer beast in the final fight. <br/><br/>The film's presiding spirit, though, is feminism, as we might expect from a woman superhero and a woman director. What's interesting is the breadth of values this feminism propounds. <br/><br/>First, it's not Woman Good, Man Bad. The evil woman scientist — popularly known as Dr Poison — proves you don't have to be male to be evil. Though, of course, it helps. Dr. Maru's marred face, with its plastic cover-up, turns the convention of cosmetics sinister. <br/><br/>On the other side of the ledger, Steve Trevor — who's such a good guy he gets two male first names — has the kind of compassion, courage and decency we'd normally expect in a woman. In fact he's the one who makes the Ultimate Sacrifice to save the world from a planeful of poison gas. He gives Diana the most impressive First Sighting of a Man since Miranda's in The Tempest.<br/><br/>Steve is feminist enough to joke about his manhood. When he tells Diana he's ""above average"" its an estimation of his overall qualifications. In the film's best joke, when she sees him full frontal, Diana wonders why men let their lives be dictated by that silly, small little thing. No, dear reader, the reference is to his watch, passed on from his father and which he passes on to her as his loving keepsake. We're doubtless intended to respond wrong.<br/><br/>This feminist hero is certainly strong, with superhuman skills, flight and strength. Her command of 100 languages also gives her a bit of an edge over the Old Boys bumbling through the British government. From Steve she learns the respect for human potential that keeps her from joining Ares. <br/><br/>Finally, this feminism extends beyond women to the marginalized and suppressed of any nation or gender. Hence her quartet of comrades at the end include three stereotype personae: the amorous little Frenchman (""voila""), Spud from Trainspotting and the alien Indian (Will Sampson's image played by Eugene Brave Rock). Diana Prince is a woman for all seasons."

He could've flown the plane to a remote location and parachuted out<br/><br/>Conclusion: - DC's best so far, however, that's not saying much. The film's Act One was on track for an 8/10 but the momentum tapered off a little towards the end.

"targe1314","7","3","9","5 June 2017"," Wait... Ares God of War is... wait...
","I am somewhat surprised by the overwhelming female reaction to Gal  Gadot's Wonder Woman, seeing as she is the product of a distraught  1940's shrink and his BDSM fantasy woman, designed to save him from  WWII while domming him with her knee high boots and truth extracting  bondage rope.  Gal G. pulls in a serviceable work on the big WW, bringing the required  'foreign' tang to her, the cheeky hints of sexuality, and leaving the  'Americanized' parts in the garbage where they belong.  Despite the length of this movie, there is precious little time spent  on any 'splainin' to her main sidekick, the very boytoy designed Chris  Pine, who asks painfully few questions and is nearly 100% obsessed with  sex when they are not shooting evil Germans. Why does Diana grow up yet  her other Amazons do not? Why are there no boytoy men as playthings on  the island? Why is their solution to war violence?  I wonder how this movie will play in Germany, who are apparently made  to be evil by a malicious god of war, Ares. German soldiers are  dispatched like cockroaches in short order by our supposed heroine.  We are not told that the British also used poison gas in WWI, and this  is made a strictly German horror, spurred on by a demonic Greek god  hiding in the wings... as David Thewlis.  It's painfully obvious from the moment he starts his 'Chamberlain peace  in our Time' speech that Thewlis is the real evil in sheep's clothing.  However, for some completely bizarre reason, the director KEEPS HIM IN  CHARACTER after he reveals himself as the God of War. So we have a  super powered god of war flying around, with David Thewlis's face and  British accent. It is so cringe-worthy it destroys the entire battle  sequence at the end of the movie.  Amazing fight visuals, the best being WW's attack on a German WWI  trench, and second being the complete slaughter of a poor hapless band  of German shipwreck survivors at the beginning of the movie, who feel  the strange need to fight to the last man against an army of super-  model women, I guess again, because Ares is making them 'evil'.  A strange and not at all well-written movie, and yet, visually a treat.  There you go."
"Troy_Campbell","7","3","9","3 June 2017"," Gadot is magnificent in the best DCEU entry.
","Warner Bros have been playing catch up with their DC Extended Universe (DCEU) for years, fruitlessly trying to match Marvel Studio's critically and commercially successful Avengers-led franchise. Wonder Woman, although not perfect, edges the DCEU closer to its goal, thanks to a refreshingly optimistic hero and a plot that is neither convoluted nor cut to pieces in the editing room. Told via a flashback framing device, this WWI-set blockbuster follows the eponymous Amazonian princess Diana as she discovers mankind during one of its ugliest eras, yet continues fighting in an attempt to bring peace and harmony. It's a simple tale, but one director Patty Jenkins manages to keep on the right side of earnest with a steady flow of action and fish-out-of-water comedy. Very much shot in the style of Zack Snyder—chockfull of speed ramping and flying sparks—the action sequences are wonderfully choreographed, but the CGI lacks photorealism at times, particularly during the opening act staged on Diana's idyllic home island. An extended set piece in which our titular goddess emerges from the trenches on the Western Front to overrun the Nazis is captivating; the dazzling cinematography and rousing score fusing together to create one the DCEU's finest moments. It helps that Jenkins has the likes of Gal Gadot in front of the camera portraying the peace-seeking warrior. Gadot is a terrific blend of strength, passion and beauty, imbuing Diana with an unstoppable righteousness that in lesser hands could have been preachy and pretentious. Relatively free from the confines of the DCEU's overlapping storytelling, Wonder Woman is an exciting superhero adventure anchored by a magnificent central performance."
"CriticomLink_YT","8","3","9","3 June 2017"," The DCEU has FINALLY hit a home run!
","Wonder Woman is the fourth film in the DCEU and takes place during World War One, therefore placing it before the events of the previous DCEU entries. It is the first female-led superhero film, as Patty Jenkins takes on the role of director and Gal Gadot stars as the titular superhero. On top of that, it's the first theatrically- released live action adaptation of the character of Wonder Woman. Chris Pine portrays Steve Trevor, and the films also stars Robin Wright as General Antiope, Danny Huston as General Ludendorff, David Thewlis as Ares, Connie Nielsen as Queen Hippolyta, Elena Anaya as Doctor Poison, and Lucy Davis as Etta Candy.<br/><br/>I'll just start right off the bat; Wonder Woman is a triumph for the DCEU and the best DC film since The Dark Knight, no question. Wonder Woman hits such a glorious home run that I almost got out of my seat and started cheering. And this is the darn truth, half of the people in my theater gave the film a standing ovation when the credits started rolling. But why? Well let me tell you. When it comes to films that are centered around one character in a vast multi-verse, it is imperative that the filmmakers get that character right. Wonder Woman is written by Zack Snyder, Allan Heinberg and Jason Fuchs and portrayed by Gal Gadot superbly. Her entire dynamic screams ""fish-out-of-water,"" and those types of characters are the ones I find to be easily relatable. As Diana Prince walks along the streets of London, marveling at the fashion popular at the time, or witnesses soldiers coming home from the war, battered and broken, you can relate to her. She isn't some experienced veteran who's used to seeing brutality like this, or some fashion supernova, she is a minnow in a pond chock full of piranhas. A minnow capable of cracking open a can of whoop-ass whenever she feels like it, I might add. The characterization of Wonder Woman/Diana Prince is unmatched in this Extended Universe, and that's complemented by Gal Gadot's colossally charismatic performance. Gadot exhibits on-point line delivery and excellent displays of emotion, and this is her best work to date in my opinion.<br/><br/>Chris Pine also put on a great performance as Steve Trevor, and the romance between Trevor and Diana was satisfyingly investing and not sappy, as the main romance is one of the most common areas where superhero movies fall flat, but not when it comes to this film. Everyone else put on really good or great performances, with Lucy Davis particularly shining.<br/><br/>On the flip side of substance, the visual/CGI effects were top- notch, although there were some parts that boasted uneven CGI (specifically the fire effects). However, one particular department I must single out is the stunt work. The stunts are amazing, and something I can appreciate is that Patty Jenkins does not use varying camera angles to mask the not-so-spectacular stunts. Not that that's a bad thing, cause even the worst stunts were still good. That tells you how dedicated Jenkins was to this project, and I dearly hope that she helms more films in the DCEU. Now back to what I was previously discussing, the fighting sequences themselves are something to behold. Unlike Captain America: Civil War, where there were some fighting scenes worth complaining about, I can't recall one dull moment of action throughout this entire film. The action and fighting sequences kept me on the edge of my seat throughout this movie's run time, while the drama rarely ever lets up. Dang, what a gem this is.<br/><br/>Is Wonder Woman just as great as The Dark Knight? No. But it does come close. Overall, Wonder Woman is a standout among the DCEU. Not just because it's colorful and not a depression-inducing shade of gray, but the film's handling and representation of the iconic titular character is unparalleled. Wonder Woman/Diana Prince is both a fierce warrior and a curious individual, determined to restore peace to mankind and learn all about their ways of life as well. Intensely terrific action, a cohesive plot, a satisfying main romance, and a colorful tone with serious elements all gel together to form my favorite film of 2017 so far. Whether you're a long-time fan of the character, or recently introduced, you'll get your money's worth and more with the DCEU's magnum opus, and hopefully this will set an example for the folks at DC in the years to come.<br/><br/>Rating - 8.4/10 stars"
"jonas_bassforce","7","3","9","3 June 2017"," Ended up decent!
","Looking at every single DC movie made after The Dark Knight trilogy, you wouldn't expect them to ever be capable of making anything more than a big CGI mess with a lot of destroying asphalt and buildings. Man Of Steel had it, Batman Vs. Superman had it and Suicide Squad was just the most horrible piece of crap ever made. But to my surprise Wonder Woman is actually a decent superhero movie very much in the same league as most of the Marvel movies! And that makes me wonder if it's not a director thing? Both BVS and Man Of Steel were made by Zack Snyder and they both are filled with destruction. This one is made by Patty Jenkins, which clearly was a good move.<br/><br/>It's interesting, exciting, funny, well made and I couldn't find anything that I disliked about it for the first two hours. Except for Robin Wright's weird attempt at speaking in an accent that just comes out Russian for some reason (reminds me a bit of Cate Blanchett in Indiana Jones 4), and of course the countless slow motion action sequences which are over-used. I thought Gal Gadot did a great job at portraying the heroine, who I disliked in BVS. It's a movie about her and her alone. It doesn't make a lot of attempts to tying the story together with the other DC movies. The music during the end credits is really good. <br/><br/>The first two hours I thought it was a really good movie. Then the main villain appears and as superhero-movie-standard they have to have a final showdown. Then they went all Zack Snyder on it and in walks big explosions, lots of destruction and a very badly executed main villain whose CGI appearance looks like he escaped off a Mortal Combat cover. After that the movie and Wonder Woman herself turned too cliché in my opinion and I rolled my eyes countless times. Luckily we didn't have to endure that for more than a couple of minutes, but it was soooo close to being a great movie. Now it just ended up decent. 7/10"
"heatsink98","7","3","9","2 June 2017"," DC finally gets going
","What's going on: We see Diana Prince at her current job, working at the Louvre, and then launch into the backstory that sees her leaving the island of the Amazons and heading off to turn the tide of World War I. The journey starts with a fairly large dollop of exposition on Zeus and the Greek gods, then on Ares--the main troublemaker--then heads to the crash of Steve Trevor's plane, which catalyzes Diana to head off to war in an attempt to find Ares and end his corrupting influence in the world. So, this movie is one large flashback. The problem with flashbacks is that they remove all worry over our hero, since he/she is clearly fine in the present.<br/><br/>The plot does have its logical issues, but the story is easily the strongest of any recent DC efforts. Notably, Zack Snyder didn't write this screenplay, and that's a positive thing. Gal Gadot does a fine job portraying Diana and showing her character's child-like delight in discovering the world she's never seen. Ice cream especially. Action scenes are really good. No problems there.<br/><br/>Back to plot logic issues. Ares is a big question mark as to what's going on with his character. We find out he despises humanity and resents Zeus, which led to the original spat with the other gods that ended them. Ares likes to prove humans are destructive prats, so he goes around prodding them toward warfare. Since the other gods are now gone, that eliminates his motivation to thumb his nose at Zeus. <br/><br/>Ares then states he wants to rid the world of humanity and return everything to a much nicer state--a pitch he makes to Diana at one point. Ares is a powerful Greek god. Why not just wipe out humanity and skip the behind-the-scenes prodding to give humans ideas on how to make weapons? Ares also seems to work against his own interests in various parts of the film by helping our heroes along. Other than providing a plot twist, why does he do that? Then there's the casting of our main villain, which didn't quite fit, but I suppose that's a matter of taste.<br/><br/>Anyway, Wonder Woman is worth seeing. It's much better than Batman v. Superman by miles, and the recent DC films before it. Toss the logic for a few hours and watch Gal Gadot beat the tar out of the bad guys."

As noted, we know that Diana Prince eventually ventures out for the greater good. Gal Gadot is beautiful, and charismatic, her portrayal of Wonder Woman is the bedrock of the film. Wonder Woman on paper sets itself up to be a cheesy superhero but this film has you take her seriously. Her adjustment to mankind outside of her daily lifestyle is intriguing and you really begin to understand her values, and how to adapt them.

That said, there is some chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine and David Thewlis is quite menacing at times as ""Sir Patrick/Ares"".

Acting wise, these superhero movies aren't Shakespeare, but I do not believe Gadot is a good actress. I also didn't find the villains to be that intimidating or scary. I know Hollywood is going to continue to give us these female driven movies but I'd like to see one that pays just as much attention to the story/plot/acting as they do the cultural significance."

","An overall mediocre movie made by-the-numbers by an unqualified director who only has one low budget film credit on her resume she made 14 years ago. Only reason I can figure why they chose her is that she was the cheapest out of a list of female directors. I could name off more qualified female directors in my sleep. And Warner Brothers obviously had little faith in her because they only signed her for one movie, and that almost never happens. <br/><br/>The movie is made even worse by a totally miscast Gal Gadot. Not only is she a bad actress, she also doesn't fit the massive popular perception of what Wonder Woman - the world's greatest female hero and a demi-goddess - should look like. Gadot is just a pretty face on top of a stick figure. They had to give her a heavily-stuffed and padded costume for her to (literally) fill the role. I never bought her as WW for a moment. <br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of female superheroes, especially Wonder Woman, but she is the total opposite of that character. It's like casting PeeWee Herman to play Superman or when they miscast short, skinny Michael Keaton to play Batman. Even director Patty Jenkins said in an interview that she never would have chosen Gadot. <br/><br/>I'm already looking forward to the next reboot and recasting. It took DC/WB 25 years to get Batman right on the big screen. Hopefully it won't take that long with WW."

If there's nothing wrong with women being sexually attracted to strong male stars like Brad Pit, Daniel Craig or Keanue Reaves for example, why is it wrong for men like us to be sexually attracted to women like Gal Gadot, Charlize Theron, Kate Beckinsale and Milla Jovovich. And make them own it. Let them be Hot and sexy and bad ass. Why hold them back for the sake of political narratives. I enjoyed this movie through and through.

Many people are going to try and tear it down saying it's a 'step-back', 'unrealistic' or just simply 'dumb', when it's everything but. It is empowering but yet so realistic, funny and sad at the same time, and of course: we have the best female superhero of all time. Wonder Woman is kind and compassionate, brave and heroic... and she doesn't have to be less to make people feel more. Steve Travor is one of the best supporting characters ever, and their romance feels real. The story feels real. The fact that it's directed by a woman just adds to it - but because of the mere fact of Patty Jenkins being a woman - but for the movie being so amazingly shot and well directed! The No Mans Land scene made me emotional such ways that not even Saving Private Ryan could. There you go I said it.

My doubts were so very unfounded, Gadot proved to be the only choice for a contemporary Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>The only problem I really had with this movie was the inclusion of a love interest.

Instead we get romance, dancing in the snow, character sub- plots that are dropped or unnecessary, the villains acting like Nazis in WWI, forced humor, a ""trying on dresses scene"" and the occasional action scene. The script cannot decide if it wants Wonder Woman to be an excitable hero ready to stop the war or a moody teenage girl. The one time Chris pine's character is actually right is when she finally doesn't listen to him and runs off. Quality writing <br/><br/>Gal Gadot cannot act and anytime she has to say a serious line(An entire village is bombed with chemicals) it sounds laughable almost every time. Her delivery was completely wooden and at times made me wonder if this movie was trying to be campy like the 70s series. After about 2 hours it finally decides ""OH! LET'S BE A ZACK SNYDER MOVIE"", the REAL villain finally appears (with a porn mustache) and breaks out a mediocre final boss fight CGI schlock fest that has been done to death in every Zack Snyder DC movie.<br/><br/>This movie spends so much time trying to figure out which way it wants to go that in the end it goes nowhere.

I'm also super-picky about movies in general. Having said this, I found Wonder Woman uncommonly refreshing...better than 99% of what comes out of Hollywood these days. Why?<br/><br/>Gal Gadot - Her screen presence is breathtaking...mesmerizing. She portrays strength with vulnerability, naivete with intelligence.<br/><br/>Chris Pine - His timing and delivery are spot-on as usual. I bet every director loves working with this guy.<br/><br/>Cinematography - From the muted colors of WWI to the lush island paradise, brilliant.<br/><br/>The story - It's not Shawshank but the emotive elements are all there. Engaging from start to finish.<br/><br/>The mythology - Basic but intriguing and credible. Great tension is created against the prevailing left-brained mindsets.<br/><br/>The jokes - Corny at times but for the most part they provided nice relief from the drama without ripping the viewer out of the moment like every other superhero movie.<br/><br/>The twist - People hate on it but I bet no one saw it coming.<br/><br/>Anyway, forget all of this -- the movie just works.

To make this review mercifully short, NO amount of action or CGI special effects will ever make up for a great script, or great acting performances. That why, like sugar-sweet breakfast cereal, ""Trix are for Kids,"" which this pile of overrated movie-making is. When I judge any film, I simply count how many times I YAWN during the movie. I can't even count how many times I yawned watching this tedious bore, out loud. The writing was comic book, the acting was comic book, and so was the water-weak plot. But where the director REALLY took a stumble was during the midpoint, where this action flick suddenly took an unexpected (and fatal) 180-degree change of pace, attempting to build on the love affair between the principals by inserting a useless ""serious"" moment in the play that only succeeded in unnecessarily slowing the film's genre pace to a bizarre exposition of supposed ""seriousness"" where it had no business being at all.

Two things take away from the experience: <br/><br/>First, the slow motion effects. When they are well done, like in 300, they work incredibly well, but when they fail they are a major turn off. Zooms on the face or animated jump sequences look incredibly out of place and spoil the pace of the otherwise well choreographed action. <br/><br/>Second, and I am sure a lot of people will disagree with me here, the political correctness agenda in this film.

","Black screen and a deep narration Backstory and World Establishment for 10 minutes Mini Greek Mythology (here is more similar to Christianity) And I'm honest I had to fight through the first 20 minutes of the movie I was about to get up 5 times and drive home. (Because the costumes are almost as awful as in ""God of Egypt."") Well, I have to say the backgrounds are quite pretty but the back story is pretty clumsy and the music is too monotonous. The film was clearly made just to destroy the Bechtel test, but I would like to ask why the Queen Hipólita was so naively written. Having heard the training instructions I've just gotten one head the movie is pretty dumb but only our main character is written with competence.<br/><br/>Seriously! All are incompetent and naive except for Princess Diana and that puts the film and its massage in the wrong light.<br/><br/>Even if I should just rate the movie as a movie, I can not say much good because I have seen and heard little good in this movie and the good things were not good enough. The only positive things I want to mention is: They gave Chris Pine the role that usually women in superheroes play movies with male heroes, I did not like it anyway but the idea was really thought through. Good job. So I admit it was a nice idea to pack this whole in that scenario of the First World War. Instead of the second but the cut is editing dreadful and the CGI look FAKE.<br/><br/>Its back to the principle that many stories are used that come with the evaluation, of course, 20 years would be kept away from the battlefield so the 0 fight-experience and yes not discovered his powers. But my biggest problem is the fact that Princess Diana will be denied fighting for as long as I'm not going to say what was in the comics or in the animated series and so on, because that's not the point at all. My problem just it's DUMP!<br/><br/>If I give birth to a child that is a demigod and I know the father will come back and visit her at some point, I train the child until the Super Saiyan-Mode so that my child can defend herself and is adequately competent enough later to take over the job as a monarch. I also think it's pretty awful to still see films that look and are made exactly the same as they were 20 years ago without any improvement or real reason. This is backward development and as a movie fan I hate to see that. The story arc could be done better, as is the character arc in this movie. The fights are .... okay.<br/><br/>The film is just full of stupid decisions empty comments and people who have not thought through to the end. I'm a bit confused and why the movie gets such good reviews but maybe I'm just a minute active, but I can not sympathize with you. Serious the movie can go to hell.<br/><br/>So the movie is not even in ""the top 50 of the worst"" I've ever seen, but definitely in the top 3 of ""the movies that upset me the most.""<br/><br/>PS .: Wonder Woman - ""I believe in love.""

","This review might have spoilers (of course, depending on what you consider a spoiler). Consider yourself warned.<br/><br/>One of the most common things I hear people say is that the only reason this movie is so popular is because it had a female lead and director, and since the only thing they can actually cite as being wrong with the movie is lacklustre special effects, it becomes clear what they really think. It's time to be real: Wonder Woman has been a radical feminist from the beginning. The William Marston creation was ultra-radical feminist, and that was only toned back after his death.<br/><br/>This movie, while certainly feminist movie, with clearly feminist moments, largely steers away from feminism. That's not to say that there aren't decidedly feminist moments. References to suffrage and suggestions of lesbianism abound in the first act, but while on balance, we see the juxtaposition of a female-dominated society with a male-dominated society, there is never a suggestion that either men or women are somehow superior to the other, though it's clearly acknowledged that men, in general, see themselves as such, and many of these tertiary characters are quite insufferable about. The male leads respect and honor their female counterparts. Luddendorf (one of the villains) respects and trusts Isabel Maru as an equal, and Steve Trevor, though some minor chauvinist behavior does show itself in the form of being unnecessarily protective, he does trust Diana to ultimately fulfill her purpose. Ares even sees an equal in Diana, someone he feels he can bargain with, and someone he believes is worth putting faith in.<br/><br/>And I just realized that I don't have enough space to say what I want to say.<br/><br/>So, I've already mentioned lacklustre effects. Its practical effects are great, but being entirely truthful, this movie is a bad CGI movie, but if taken on balance, I doubt that is what it will be remembered for. This movie has what most Hollywood movies these days don't; heart. You care about the characters, not just as protagonists, but as people. The performances are very human. Diana's reactions to the world around her are delightful; her reaction to ice cream, her joy at seeing a baby. What stands out most is Diana's inherent kindness and overall compassion. You believe she hurts seeing the suffering of other people. You believe her helplessness when she realizes that there are no solutions to the world's problems.<br/><br/>People cry about the CGI, say the third act was weak, and complain about too much slow-motion (of which there's barely two minutes). Yes, the CGI was bad. But no, the third act was not weak. Either they aren't really watching the movie, or they're trying to see something that isn't there. I'm inclined towards the later."
"Blackbird013-1","4","3","10","3 October 2017"," Deceptive in it's anti-feminism and propaganda
","This film was amusing in the start, and as it continued I became ashamed I had bought it.<br/><br/>The film is misleading in a number of ways. It portrays wonder woman as a mindless military girl (which I suppose is why they wanted an actress with vehement military propaganda history involved) with no real mind for true philosophy, education, and refinement in spite of her good heart making her a intellectually needy character (The character, not the actress). We are led to believe the daughter of a god was raised by the amazons with only a military war training and lacked education on politics (which existed even in ancient history), the arrogance of men, or any clue how to behave or operate in the real world where she was not a central figure in the eyes of everyone. She floundered in the city in a very unbecoming way. She could see only her obsession on the horizon without applying any tactics about how to achieve her goal other than insist he guide her there. Too many things here point to a false feminine icon that is actually more of a female barbarian with a weapon. The times would change but a true royal education even if ancient would have included tactical presentation.<br/><br/>Wonderwoman was more than just formidable she was thoughtful and intelligent. The original bungled a little, but not so badly that she would not be aware that everyone else in a city was not wearing a sword and fur cape and that she was not blending in when they stared. The man had to guide her to appropriate clothing pointing out she was being noticed (somewhat anti-feminist when you consider she had centuries to be educated). She then handed over her sword tipping off a total stranger that she believed everything depended on it being guarded safely. The wonder woman we knew was intellectually formidable as well as physically. A true classical tactician would have known how to find a way to address a room of men rather than be ignored completely. If I'm reading too much into the downplay of feminism here it's because I'm familiar with how the original wonder woman entered the city without help and handled everything almost seamlessly without help installing herself as an in the know secretary.<br/><br/>Reading after watching (which I should have done before buying it) revealed that a lot of the hype was pro Israel military going as far as saying that wonder woman was an Israeli hero from the start claiming the character nationally when the movie clearly labeled her as a descendant of a Greek god. If the movie was going to be used for propaganda they should have hired a Greek actress so the right country would herald and claim her boosting the ratings. This is very ironic since the function of Wonderwoman in this movie was to stop the god of war which is the exact opposite of propagating war.<br/><br/>While it is supposed to portray a strong female hero, I think it portrays wonder woman as an indestructible barbarian with a good heart. So far as the death of her main interest it was a cliché' way to avoid any entanglements that could last long enough to imply anything could happen. I apologize for any offense, I'm just being realistic about my reaction to this it's a bit insulting to wonder woman, feminism, and the concept of the amazons as well as ancient Greek culture which was one of the most advanced at that time. <br/><br/>Is the message that women can work out and train physically but even a goddess after centuries or millennia of education is incapable of true intelligence?"
"knapman-75654","3","3","10","11 September 2017"," Mixing fantasy with actual history is a big no-no
","Wonder Woman, for me, was overall just a ludicrous movie. <br/><br/>It began as most superhero movies do, setting the scene of the hero. However, Wonder Woman did this like no other superhero movie I've seen before, in that it barely tells you anything about Wonder Woman. Sure it tells you a bit about Greek mythology and the whole Aries vs. Zeus thing and how the Amazonian's came to exist, but it barely scratches the surface of Wonder Woman herself.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman discovered she had these powers during her training, but never questioned why she had them. Nearly every superhero movie you see, the hero goes through a difficult time understanding their origins and why they have these powers. Wonder Woman just sort of shrugs her shoulders as if it's totally normal to have no father and have these powers. There was zero character development, which led me not to care about Wonder Woman at all.<br/><br/>Also, she seems to flip and flop about her beliefs. She preaches pacifism and love yet goes killing ""bad guys"". How does she even know these people are bad? Why are the Germans bad but the British aren't? She just naively believes what she is told about the war without ever questioning anything. <br/><br/>The main issue I had with the movie though, was the merging of fantasy and ACTUAL historical events. I know superheros and real world merge all the time, but it's the first I've seen an historical event get taken over by some superhero. Throughout the movie I couldn't help but question all of the events going on with what actually happened in WWI. The whole no man's land scene was absolutely ridiculous in this regard. She just wanders across this land whilst soaking up bullets to allow the entire British army to advance? Please! <br/><br/>Another problem is a lack of a protagonist in the movie. We're told how Aries is a terrible person from the get go, but we never see Aries. WW simply believes Aries is the leader of the Germans because anybody who leads an army to war HAS to be Aries, duh! The problem is, who we think is Aries never actually does anything that bad. Okay he develops a gas that can kill people and uses it during the war. So? No different than any other killing going on throughout the movie. I never felt like the bad guy was all that bad, which made me feel like WW's personal crusade was largely pointless. I couldn't care less if she killed him or not. <br/><br/>Finally, once WW kills who she thinks is Aries, she discovers nothing changes and the war continues. This is when the REAL Aries suddenly shows up, some guy you've barely seen the entire movie. I wouldn't even give it the respect of calling it a twist as it was just stupid. A twist you can understand in hindsight, this guy just shows up from nowhere and is apparently Aries. Some huge battle takes place, at which point you've probably stopped caring, and WW kills him too. Magically, the armistice is then signed and the war is over. WW claims love is the answer to everything and the movie ends."
"paulp-17-642936","6","3","10","2 September 2017"," Some good sequences but overall formulaic and ultimately sappy
","I went into this movie with high expectations anticipating a creative ""origins"" movie in the class of Ironman and Batman Begins. Instead the movie lacked both the creativity and authenticity of these other films. While there are rather long sequences of supposed meaningful dialogue that attempt to give the film depth, I found them neither inspiring nor believable. Ultimately, the movie ends with a ""message"" that came across as corny and had me and others who watched it with me rolling our eyes in embarrassment.<br/><br/>The movie did have a couple of great sequences. The depiction of how the Greek pantheon ended up in the state they were in is very well done and was very engaging. And foxhole sequence was the most authentic in the movie and one that should have been the pattern for the entire film. The costumes are excellent as well.<br/><br/>But the movie lacks a grittiness and realism that makes other origin movies so enjoyable. Where it attempts to be gritty, it feels contrived. The world of the early 1900s created in the film feels computer generated and that made it difficult to lose yourself in the narrative (I found myself looking at the clock continually). I never got into ""flow"" with this film.<br/><br/>Finally, the story is too grandiose. The story should have been about Diana and the complex development of her as a hero. Instead the writers bit off far too much and attempt narratives on six other principle characters, a world war, the Greek pantheon, and an Amazonian society. They end up doing justice to none of them and end up less with a character study as they do a disjointed and shallow video game like experience.<br/><br/>While the movie is fine entertainment for family film night, unfortunately it doesn't have a place in the pantheon of the excellent origin films of recent years. Too bad."
"jamesrupert2014","6","3","10","27 July 2017"," Over-rated superhero film - watchable but neither novel nor special
","At the risk of being accused of misogyny, I didn't think 'Wonder Woman' was a particularly good movie. The opening sequences, albeit colourful, were slow and, in the context of subsequent events, made little sense (why learn to shoot arrows and wield swords when your destiny is to fight an indestructible God who wields lightening?). The standard fish-out-of water scenes as Diana first experiences London were OK, but the movie went downhill as the pace picked up. There were a number of plot holes (commented on at length elsewhere) but my biggest problem was the inconsistency of Wonder Woman's 'powers', which seemed to fall into the sloppy writing trap of being whatever the plot requires at the moment. Early on, we see that she can be hurt by a grazing bullet (but heals quickly), yet she can climb a stone wall by smashing handholds into the rock with her bare hands without as much as breaking a nail and later runs through a hail of bullets, shell fragments, and flying debris without even a nick). Similarly, we establish that she can jump great distances but at the climax of the film she seems to be able to fly (or at least hover). The movies is full of freeze frames during fights, dramatic poses (presumably for lobby cards), the clichéd superhero ground-shattering three-point landing, and some scenes that are just silly (Godot looks stunning in the blue gown she steals but the implication that she is still wearing her ""Wonder Women"" outfit underneath the dress is ridiculous). Gal Godot is fine (and has the looks for the part), Chris Pine is serviceable, and the rest of the cast play their generic 'characters' adequately (except David Thewlis, who is a great actor, but as Ares, God of War, was about as menacing as an Ewok). All-in-all, 'Wonder Woman' is a routine superhero movie that covers much of the same ground as the far better (IMO) ""Captain America"". The movie would have benefited by tighter writing and more attention to details and consistency (i.e. set whatever rules you want but then play within them) and less cartoon-physics (presumably if you hold up a 30-ton tank, your feet will sink into the ground or at least crack the pavement). I suspect that much of the acclaim for this film reflects a hesitation to criticise a female-superhero movie directed by a women and in fact, 'Wonder Woman' supports the idea of gender equity by demonstrating that a woman can direct an over-blown, 100 million dollar, mediocre action film as well as a man can."

","This movie has very good special effects and good action scenes. I wonder if any super hero movie will ever get by without overdone martial arts battles but this one has them too. Anyway ... it's an absolutely ordinary action movie in most of the parts. The humor is shallow, all the characters are painfully stereotypical and the plot is easily predictable."
"christinapichler","6","3","10","30 June 2017"," DC is on the right way but still has to improve a lot
","""Wonder Woman"" is the latest installment in the DC Extended Universe and the first one to receive excellent critical responses. The movie is considered an empowerment for women and equality. Having finally seen the movie, my feelings towards it are unfortunately mixed.<br/><br/>There are many aspects I really liked about the movie. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are perfectly cast in their roles. Diana Prince is a naive but fierce heroine and very likable. She definitely is the best part of the movie for me. Her character is well fleshed out and she has great chemistry with Chris Pine's character. Furthermore there are some spectacular action sequences in the movie. The stunt work is just stunning and the often present slow motion additionally helps to appreciate the action scenes. Despite the brilliant action throughout the movie, the film really thrives on its quite moments that focus on the character development, which is very present in this superhero flick. <br/><br/>Sadly there are a few aspects about the movie that I did not like. The humor was not funny at all in my opinion and the movie could have easily gone without it. Further there were a few scenes that appeared forced to me like the conversation at the gala between Wonder Woman and General Ludendorff. These minor points of criticism did not ruin the movie for me though. <br/><br/>However, the third part of the movie did. I do not want to go into spoilers here but one character was in my opinion extremely miscast and appeared quite hilarious to me. Additionally, the last part of the movie is quite CGI heavy which also added to taking away the tension, since the CGI was not exceptionally well done and could have been handled better. Also the big reveal at the end was kind of disappointing and felt forced in my opinion, since there has not been a single hint towards it and I had the impression that it was included simply because they felt that they could not go for a straight forward plot. For all the reasons, I was not able to enjoy the last part of the movie and unfortunately it took away a lot from the experience.<br/><br/>To sum up, Wonder Woman is definitely the best DC Extended Universe movie that has been released yet but I simply cannot relate to the excellent reviews it receives. Most part of the movie I really enjoyed but the third part just ruined so much for me that it makes it impossible for me to say I am a fan of the film. Nonetheless, I think DC is on the right path with investing more into character driven movies instead of cramping every possible into a single film."
"brainy_physio","6","3","10","28 June 2017"," Overrated. Needs a lot of refinements.
","In spite of all the marketing hype, a shallow story, meaningless fight moves, barely-acceptable performances of the protagonist and her side kicks, and a poor casting choice of the main antagonist; all make for a mediocre movie that is highly overrated. I cannot believe that some people are even comparing this movie to Nolan's dark knight trilogy which were not only good superhero movies, but really good movies. Wonder woman is not even a good superhero movie. It is, however, the best big screen adaptation of the DC heroine so far. Let's hope justice league will be better."
"briannavaldiviezobv","5","3","10","26 June 2017"," Failed; just as every DC movie has so far
","All of DC movies have been bombing horrifically, except for Man of Steel. Batman v Superman was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Suicide Squad was not as awful as B v. S, but was incredibly corny and cringe. Wonder Woman is continuing this DC tradition. First off, the movie was much too long. There was so much extra crap that was not at all necessary to the plot of the movie or character development. The beginning was a drag because there was too much time spent on her as a child; it could have been cut in half and worked just fine. DC also seems to always to have multiple, very dramatic and drawn out, scenes followed up with extremely corny dialogue. The first few fighting scenes were decent but they were all so repetitive and, of course, there was about 50 scenes of her in slow motion walking towards the enemy. The director should have saved the dramatic, slow motion clips for the end, if any at all. Second, there was so many rip-offs of Captain America. The fight against the Germans, the love interest leading the protagonist into the conflict, the shield that deflected many bullets and the martyr scene at the end (Except Captain Steve Rogers survives). Captain America was a very good movie and this was a bad knock-off. DC is trying to hard to keep up with Marvel but Marvel has been building up the Avengers for 9 years. Marvel had so much time to produce many great movies, while DC is failing. Wonder Woman is a prime example. Do not pay to see this in theaters."
"john_seater","5","3","10","25 June 2017"," Gal Gadot Ten, Script Writers Zero
","I was very disappointed with this movie. The preview clips gave the impression it would be a lot of fun. Unfortunately it is so badly and routinely written that it wasn't much fun. That's too bad because Gal Gadot does a great job as Wonder Woman. Chris Pine is good, too, in his supporting role, but it is Gadot who carries the film and prevents it from being a total flop.<br/><br/>The main problem with the writing is that there is no tension, no suspense, no real surprise anywhere. Wonder Woman uses all her powers early in the show, so the rest of the action becomes predictable. It also becomes clear early on that Wonder Woman is invincible, so there you never are sitting on the edge of your chair wondering what is going to happen next. The bad guys are the World War I Germans, and they are all really bad, out-of-historical-context proto-Nazis. The result is just another trumped up routine superhero action flick. Who cares? Well, I wouldn't care if it weren't for Gal Gadot. She's terrific as Wonder Woman. She has the right combination of humor, sweet simplicity, and bad ass attitude to pull off the role. She seems to have real talent as an actress. I hope to see more performances by her in productions that are worthy of her skills."
"steerpike_2002","6","3","10","21 June 2017"," Strong performances not quite enough to rescue muddled themes
","There is a lot of expectation going into this movie which I think has probably helped it critically. On the one hand, it is the latest instalment in the DCEU franchise, which I think even critics want to eventually give a good score to, if only to provide some balance against the all-conquering critical success of the Marvel universe movies. Then there's the fact that this is the big female-lead movie of the year and critics will go in wanting to like it for this fact alone. With these factors combined, an average movie will probably pass, in the short term at least, for a great one.<br/><br/>And I think that this is what has happened in this case. ""Wonder Woman"" is far from being a bad movie. A lot of reviewers have focused on the fun feel to the movie as a positive. It's certainly the most cartoon-y superhero movie to come out of the DCEU so far which seems to be a response from Warner Brothers to criticism of the drained palette and humourlessness of ""Batman vs. Superman"". While it is fun, there are definitely negatives to this style, with considerably less grit in the overly bouncy action scenes. These cannot escape from Zack Snyder's creative influence and suffer as a result. <br/><br/>The core strengths of the movie are the central characters, Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). The characters are written well, with Wonder Woman's do-gooder resolve offset by her naivety. Gal Gadot gives a great physical and emotional performance, her movements, postures and facial expressions capturing her strength and, well, goodness perfectly. Comparisons to Christopher Reeve as Superman are fitting, and she is every bit as dashing as Reeve was. Pine almost steals the show as the love interest. He has tremendous chemistry with Gadot and his character has enough depth to be interesting in his own right.<br/><br/>I did find the setting of the story in WWI a big distraction and a flawed choice thematically. The character Wonder Woman was created in the 1940s and her origins placed in WWII, where she battles the evil Nazis alongside Allied forces. The writers' choice here to shift this back to WWI could have been justified. For such a staunchly anti-war character, in some ways WWI is a better fit. It serves as a symbol of a mechanised embodiment of war which simply consumed men and resources rather than serving any cause. Had the creators of the movie emphasised the meaninglessness of the conflict, with no clear distinction between good sides and bad sides, it would have been a great setting to test Wonder Woman's moral strength. It also fits with Wonder Woman's key motive during the film - she must destroy Ares, as it is his external agency that she believes has corrupted men and drawn them into the conflict.<br/><br/>Sadly the writers want to have their cake and eat it, so alongside this core theme we get some gleefully evil German villains who would clearly be more at home in a WWII setting. Wonder Woman is always fighting the Germans and never seems to really question whether the Triple Entente are any better. This isn't a hard choice, since it's the Germans here, and not the British, who are out to create super death gas (never mind the fact that both sides used chemical weapons during the actual war). I genuinely don't think that the movie ever really makes up its mind about which of its conflicting ideas is right, a non-trivial problem at the heart of the film.<br/><br/>The motivation for the change of setting appears, to me at least, to have been largely aesthetic and probably driven by a desire for something less familiar than WWII. Director Patty Jenkins showed a shocking ignorance of this problem when she said ""World War I is...not something that we really know the history of."" This ignorance of the issues raised by this creative decision only increases the validity of these criticisms.<br/><br/>It's a real shame because, action scenes aside, so much of the hard work to make this movie great is in place. The look and mood of the film and the casting choices are all spot on and the story could really have worked with more sensitivity and courage from the writers. As it is, the film must be seen as a decent, but undeniably flawed effort."

","After the disappointments of Man of Steel, BvS, Suicide Squad.. I still had my hopes up for Wonder Woman, because she was the only thing that made BvS bearable!<br/><br/>And finally this movie made it. It is a simple origins story, but that is beside the point. Gal Gadot brings to it a simple innocence and 'clean slate' sort of feel to the whole DCEU. For once, this hero had no excess baggage and just wanted to do the right thing.<br/><br/>There's a lot other positive things that can be said about WW, but mainly the fact that we finally get a female superhero as the lead, in her own solo film, and what a good film it is, who is not seen as the sexy character, or the stupid 'i don't know how the world works' character, or one who needs help from her man (although she did get help, it wasn't because she needed it, it was because the world needed it).

I wasn't looking for a physics lesson.<br/><br/>A lot of media attention was focused on the femi-nazi's zeal of the movie because of the female heroine. Boy I bet they were disappointed. The island of tough chicks who made their outfits look hot were created by the leader of a group of Greek gods. They were created for the purpose of helping the gods or the people.

She's just a mortal (or so it seemed for most of the movie), and she manages to charge lines of armed enemy soldiers, deflecting hundreds of bullets coming at her all at once in different directions (even with her bracelets, etc). (Superman came from a different world and had super powers. Batman was human (like seemingly Wonder Woman) but handled just small crime gangs and individual criminals.) I also cringed at the fierce practice sword fighting scenes among the Amazon women: a wonder no one would get hurt. (2) I am not a prude but at one point in the movie there was continual references to nude Steve Trevor's (offscreen) genitalia -- blatant references and much innuendo.

"szearc","9","3","10","11 June 2017"," My favorite DC movie so far, on par with one of the better Marvel movies
","I watched Batman vs Superman, and in my opinion, the best thing that movie had going for it was the appearance of Wonder Woman in the final fight against Doomsday... Gal Gadot is perfect for the role, it was really refreshing that DC went with a little known new face rather than an established actress. She commands the screen, is likable, beautiful, heroic, human, and believably genuine in her performance.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of comicbook movies, my favorites include the original Guardians of the Galaxy, the first Iron Man, the Avengers, and Hellboy, and for an old classic, Superman II with Christopher Reeve. I think what makes for a successful comicbook movie is the ability to make the protagonists relatable to the audience despite their amazing powers, to have a touch of humor mixed in with the amazing spectacular cinematic action sequences where if you took a snapshot of it, it could easily be a frame from an artful comicbook page. Wonderwoman I think is one of the few DC movies that captures all of these qualities.<br/><br/>In most of the Batman movies, and in each of the newer Superman movies, I find that I really don't care about the protagonist. The heroes seem unrelatable, powerful but not very likable or heroic. In most of the DC films, it's really hard to understand what the hero is doing, what their motivations are, Batman and Superman seem like abstract caricatures rather than real people... Wonderwoman is the first DC movie that I think has heart and really feels ""heroic"" in the DC cinematic universe. I wish every DC movie was this good."

"tinyfordst","7","3","10","11 June 2017"," Plot holes covered by beautiful casting
","So to get right to the core Wonder Woman was not a great film. The plot holes were massive and the progress was way to slow. The directing was okay and the production was high budget quality (maybe a bit higher than what you would expect from the budget they had). The CGI was brilliant and the acting was spot on... So why would I only give it a 7 then?<br/><br/>Well to put it in the words of Louie CK ""There is no such thing as an accent, it's just a whole country of people saying words wrong"". The movie starts off with some of the strangest takes on the English accent that you have ever heard, all because Gal Gadot cannot speak English with an American accent, so for that reason everyone needs to talk weird. Then there is the fact that day and night differs in areas one moment and the next they are perfectly aligned. The battles were against horrible fighters and it almost made iron man 3's battle against the falling rocks look more credible. Diana had no knowledge of who she is yet she possessed perfect knowledge of her abilities within seconds. <br/><br/>All of this was not thought through well enough, but then you realize that this is not about a good story. It's about a beautiful woman who can also fight, and that is CLEARLY stated in the film. I think that the biggest challenge in the film was to get Gal Gadot and Chris Pine's hottest angles right every time. If you see the film you'll know what I mean. It all revolves around their beauty and granted it worked. Every guy walking out of the cinema now has a new Hollywood crush and every girl revived their Hollywood crush on Chris Pine. <br/><br/>BUT I don't think that is what stories are about. Any two other actors that were a bit less ""hot"" would've seriously tanked this film. Good effort for a film and luckily not another attempt at making comedy superhero movies."

However, it is still energetic and the story is refreshingly simple compared to other DC movies. It is the best DC movie that has been released in recent years (besides Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" trilogy of course). ""Wonder Woman"" also breaks down some stereotypes in action movies- for example, the male romantic interest in ""Wonder Woman"" is shown naked while women in other action movies are typically the ones to be shown in a ""sexy"" point of view. This movie is important to me because l am a woman that loves superhero movies and film in general.

I wrote a very positive review and in the end, mentioned that I'd gladly pay a ticket for the sequel. But over the days since I posted the review, I have had uncomfortable thoughts about the script even if the movie has been very well made. It has a story based loosely on events around World War I or II and projects the Germans(of that era) as villains. Yes Germany in the early 1900s were the ""bad guys"" like how maybe North Korea is looked upon today. It's a past that people want to forget, so it can feel uncomfortable for many who are natives of the country to see glimpses of their dark history show up on screen again, especially as an entertainment. Is this how a comic need to be? But then, Hollywood has, over the last many decades, made entertainment and profit from past misdeeds of other countries like the Vietnam, Russia, Iraq, North Korea or Afghanistan. It's ironic since in this movie, Wonder Woman accuses a character that he's into the war for profits. My dislike is just not about Wonder Woman really. I have had issues with the scripts of few other DC or Marvel movies released over the last few years(not to mention some of the violence shown) too.<br/><br/>So although I score Wonder Woman high for sincere performances(Gal Gadot, Chris Pine and Robin Wright especially) and lot of technical hard work(music, visuals, effects, action or cinematography), I cannot recommend it unfortunately.

"AggressivePizza","7","3","10","3 June 2017"," Gal Gadot breathes life into the character of Diana, exalting her emotion and perseverance
","In the fourth entry into the DC Extended Universe, Gal Gadot lights up the screen as the pure and brave Diana. The film begins with rather clunky exposition to establish who Diana is, where and what she represents, etc. Although essential to her character development, the first 20 minutes or so are rather painful to sit through, as there is nothing kinetic or noteworthy about the first few scenes on the Amazons' island. However, once the plot is jump-started to life by the arrival of Chris Pine's character, an American acting as a spy within the German ranks, this movie finally begins to bloom.<br/><br/>Gadot and Pine's chemistry is immediately recognizable, and a funny and thought-provoking scene on the sailboat is one of the highlights of the film. The rest of the acting is perfectly decent, but the two leads are downright extraordinary that it almost detracts from the supporting cast. Gadot in particular is perfect for the part: she was born to be Wonder Woman. She flows seamlessly from being the fish out of water to the fearless war hero; her consistent interpretation of the role was crucial to the success of the narrative especially considering most comic book origin stories have the hero evolve too quickly and/or drastically.<br/><br/>The action scenes are often plagued by cheesy slow-motion cuts, which would have worked much better in a lighter movie. Unfortunately, the confusing contrast between Diana's fervent battle prowess and her soft spot for preserving humanity was not readily apparent, and the way the action was shot further shed light on this flaw. On the bright side, however, I was pleasantly surprised by how refreshing most of the action set pieces were. A lesser filmmaker would have opted for larger, less intimate scenes, but director Patti Jenkins made the right call by focusing on tight, mostly self-contained battles where Diana's fighting carried more emotional weight.<br/><br/>The key success of the movie, besides Gadot's performance, is definitely what it has to say about humanity through its depiction of the final months of World War One. Even though many creative liberties were taken in regards to the actual historical events, ""Wonder Woman"" is the first DCEU film to succeed in matching its dark tone to a quality, easily-digested message. The revelations about the villain Ares, although predictable and not all that groundbreaking, rang true because of how well the film allows the viewer to see the conflict as Diana does.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" does have a few flaws, but thankfully it doesn't inherit too many from the three previous DCEU films. Nonetheless, the villain Ares suffers the same fate as nearly every comic book villain: pure evil and chaos with no nuance. The final battle between Diana and Ares, while visually passable, is too long, too flashy, and honestly boring. After watching Diana nimbly weave her way through German soldiers for the entire movie, being subjected to watch her awkwardly throw herself at Ares is really unsatisfying.<br/><br/>All things considered, ""Wonder Woman"" succeeds because it channels more emotion and less eye candy than its peers. It devotes itself wholeheartedly to trying to be different on a narrative level, to meld the otherworldly power of the superhero with the conscience and soul that all people naturally have. Diana just so happens to be the perfect superhero to perform this with, due to how well she can oscillate between compassion and courage; between empathy and valor."
"mrbeardjs","7","3","10","3 June 2017"," A WONDERful New Step for the DCEU
","Following the average films which came before, the eyes and hopes for the DCEU was on the shoulders of WW. WW is the step in the right direction for the universe and gives it the kick it needs to hopefully make this universe stronger. While this film was a vast improvement over the other outings in the DCEU it still suffers from issues that plague most modern superhero movies. <br/><br/>First the strong points. The first act set on Themyscira is a department from other films in the DCEU in that it actually has colour which makes the world seem like a better place and helps to show the strength of the amazons. This setting helps to see that WW is a good character with hope, something which the DCEU version of superman lacks. The first act also gives us the start of the relationship between WW and ST (Chris Pine), while I have issues with the Love of the relationship I could not help but notice the incredible chemistry between the two and both put in some of their best acting ever. This acting continued all through the film and only got stronger. Unlike the previous films in the universe it actually has moments of light and comic relief. The setting of WW1 is strong as it is not a time period which is used in major films to often. In tone with the setting the costumes help in selling the period with all players looking like soldiers. WW costume has went through slight changes from her appearance on BvS in that its more colourful, this is a strong change as it helps to sell the hope that she has for the world and mankind The action in the movie is incredible and the stunt work is done extremely well. The film is well paced with each part moving at a reasonable rate. This is down to the lack of any sharp editing of the movie like what happened to BvS and SS. Last point, the film is allowed to breath and only contains small nods to a wider universe, it acts as its own movie.<br/><br/>Now for the negatives. While the action in the movie is strong, it suffers from an overuse of slow-mo as well as moving to fast which makes some action beats seem rushed. The film relies to heavily on cgi and it is most clear in the final act of the film. Their are moments in the film when it is clear that the actors are working with a green screen. The film suffers from some of the same problems that plague both DC and Marvel movies such as the cgi heavy final act as well as the weak villain characters and most supporting characters. The villains of the film are not used enough in the film which hampers any character development for them. The same goes for the supporting cast of the film, some are used for comic relief and others are barely used at all. Their are some great actors on the movie who are not giving enough screen time which is a shame. Some of the best jokes and action beats have been ruined in the trailers and while it does not hamper the film too much, it would have been nice to see them fresh in the film. The relationship between the two leads at times felt too forced. There were certain moments that felt to similar to events that happened in the first captain America film and it ruined the story a bit. <br/><br/>So while the film did have its issues, it was still a good movie and is the best in the DCEU. It hopefully shows that the studio now sees what needs to be done and they are willing to fix it."

","As a lot of DC movies so far, Wonder Woman suffers from a lot of heavy exposition, pacing problems, and rushed villains. However, what keeps Wonder Woman strong is its interesting story, characters, and world building. It has a 2 sided argument between man's and woman's world and it's very well balanced. The characters have real conversations now and not like a bunch of cut board robots. The tone and style of the film presents Wonder Woman in an accurate way. There's colorful cinematography that reminds audience of the first Superman films. Although, it may not look like true technicolor was used, it's still breathtaking to watch. The action is standard to above average. There's several moments of distracting slow motion, but it's not abused compared to 300. The visual effects or fine, sometimes they will be very distracting, but it's a movie about gods and superhero people. Of course there will be a lot of CGI. There's a whole lot of good DC has got right instead of bad, but they still need to work on their marketing skills and fix things the MCU has not fixed. There are three villains in Wonder Woman and they are all rushed with barely much screen time. They are not underdeveloped to the extent of Doomsday in BvS, but they are wasted potential for sure. The performances are average to good, Gal Gadot does a good job as Wonder Woman, except for one over-dramatic part in the final battle. The best performer is Chris Pine as Steve Trevor. He brings a shred of charm and courage to the film and he is a great side man for Wonder Woman. Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen also do great jobs as convincing mentors of Diana. The villain performers on the other hand very much overcooked their performances. They were over the top and they weren't all that great. Where the movie falls and rises is the third act. The final battle adds tons of heart and character to Wonder Woman as well as the message the film accumulates to, but like any other superhero flick, a wasted villain. Do not be surprised if the villain twist was so predictable, I blame it on early Wonder Woman marketing that Warner Bros. didn't keep as a secret. <br/><br/>Overall, I give it a 7.6/10. Definitely the best superhero flick so far this year."
"ljlaffend","8","3","10","2 June 2017"," Well worth your time.
","We begged, we pleaded, and finally Warner Bros. and DC Comics have given us a live-action movie worth getting excited about. After the plot holes of Man of Steel and the disappointments of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad, the Patty Jenkins directed Wonder Woman is the first DC movie to be, at least, on level with the films being churned out for the Marvel cinematic universe. Additionally, as the first live-action superhero movie led by a woman both as the protagonist and the director, Wonder Woman, which comes out June 2, is well worth your local theater's ticket price.<br/><br/>For those not familiar with Wonder Woman's story, audiences are introduced to Princess Diana (aka Wonder Woman), played by Lilly Aspell (8) and Emily Carey (12), as the only child living on the secret Amazon-inhabited island of Themyscira. She desperately wants to become a warrior like the superhuman women who surround her, but her mother, Queen Hippolyta (played by Connie Nielsen), tries her hardest to forbid it. Predictably, Diana betrays her mother's wishes and becomes the strongest Amazonian and most bad-ass woman the world has ever seen. At the peak of her training, a World War I Central Powers fighter pilot-slash-Allies spy, Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine), crashes into the ocean off the shores of the hidden island of Themyscira, sparking Diana's adventures in the world of men and war.<br/><br/>Read More: https://www.ljlaffend.com/single-post/2017/06/01/Review- Wonder-Woman"
"bkrauser-81-311064","8","3","10","31 May 2017"," Finally DC Makes a Halfway Decent Film!
","Part of the problem with the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) is it often feels like it's beholden to a lot of different masters. From the get go, it needed to be immediately palpable to mainstream audiences while throwing in enough fan-service for those who knew every esoteric piece of increasingly convoluted mythology. It then needed to balance that same mythology on the backs of a multitude of reoccurring characters, a plethora of converging themes, a gauntlet of story dynamics and, because the whole circus had the unmistakable tinge of a franchise geared towards Monster swilling, Call of Duty playing, insecure 13-year-olds, it also throws in pretentious amounts of Philosophy 101 under the auspice of being ""mind-blowing"". Add to all that Warner Bros.'s desire to copy Marvel while emphatically denying they're copying Marvel, and their pesky need to, you know, keep the lights on, it's become pretty clear they've bitten off a lot more than they can chew.<br/><br/>Thankfully Wonder Woman douses the still raging dumpster fire that is the DCEU with a tall glass of soothing bio-luminescent water. It takes out half the algebra, concentrates on the basics and leaves you with a singularly excellent movie. It's not perfect, and it may not give DC the course correction it truly needs but it still conjures memories of Christopher Reeves's Superman (1978) in the best possible sense. So for now I say, stand aside superherodom, Wonder Woman has finally arrived and boy is it about d**n time.<br/><br/>Nearly the entirety of Wonder Woman takes place before the events of BvS: Electric Boogaloo (2016); which places our titular character on the island of Themyscira somewhere between Ancient Antiquity and the early twentieth century. It's established early on that Diana (Gadot) is a near-immortal, living in relative peace with her mother Queen Hippolyta (Nielsen), her aunt General Antiope (Wright) and the rest of her Amazonian peers.<br/><br/>That is until the day Steve Trevor (Pine), a roguish American pilot and British Intelligence spy, crash lands on the shores of the island and fills everyone in on The Great War (WWI). Hearing that millions of innocents have already been slaughtered, Diana concludes that Ares, the mythical God of War, must be behind all the carnage and vows to stop him. It's a simplistic and naive worldview that Steve doesn't truly buy, but she saved his life and can kill him in nearly a hundred ways..so off they go to stop the war.<br/><br/>Now there are many reasons to celebrate the arrival of Wonder Woman. It's a controlled and structured narrative (emphasis on the word: structured) that sustains itself with interesting, believable characters, organic fish-out-of-water humor and a clear black hat, white hat binary. It introduces Diana as a source of both physical and inner strength and never thinks to undermine that strength in the service of cultural appeasement. It includes both the best and most far-fetched aspects of Wonder Woman's mythos, while grounding everything in reality and, and here's the greatest part, the movie makes it all look easy. This thing isn't molded with the jagged edges of plot contrivances and misplaced bluster but rather meets its overall serious tone with a simple story that's ironically about the complexities of human nature.<br/><br/>If we're being honest though, the whole enterprise would arguably be for not, if it wasn't in the capable hands Gal Gadot. She takes what could have been a female Superman clone and turns Diana into a fun, engaging character who's energy is bolstered by her determinism and purity of heart. She not only brings a level of command and natural chemistry to the party, she also brings a physicality to the role which was only hinted at in BvS: The Silent Killer, because it's hard to pit your Kung Fu kickboxing, capoeira, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and swordsmanship skills against a CGI ug-monster.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the movies third act which, by in-large sticks the landing but fits a little too comfortably in the ""hero v large, fake-looking monster"" box. Worse still, because the film cashes in on the audience's goodwill to relay what might come across as a sappy mission statement, many may feel Wonder Woman's character change is loose and unearned. I'd argue that by simply stressing an economy of thought (there's also a love story at play, let's not forget) in what is essentially a summer popcorn flick, the overall product should be met with appreciation if not applause.<br/><br/>Okay DC bro's you can stop complaining no one likes your movies Maybe I'm just so used to the DCEU s**tting the bed on a regular basis, that finding halfway decent sheets with hospital corners feels like a godsend. In the months to come, the faults may loom larger and the positives may dissipate in a cloud of noxious bat gas. For now though, I'm going to safely announce that Wonder Woman is unarguably the best in the franchise and I'll also put a little skin in the game by saying this movie will stand the test of time."

","What did we expect from Wonder Woman? After all, who was this Gal Gadot who is more Fast & Furious in this film? These were the questions that ran through my mind before and after watching the new DC Comics release.<br/><br/>After the hit Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad, expectations have increased even more for this film in which the protagonist is a woman, what the hell of woman! Not to be outdone, Gal Gadot makes us forget for a moment the classic Lynda Carter of the 1970s and does not even make us think about the only female protagonist of a DC movie, Halle Berry. The story is clear, it takes you from beginning to end directly, here there is no time to introduce the profile of the character on the screen! - sorry David Ayer. <br/><br/>The plot is divided into two parts and follows what is proposed, development and conclusion, a prime factor that was not seen in this new phase of DC films and that left the fans afraid to embark on a new journey.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman fulfills what it promises and Gal Gadot further confirms the rise of the new female characters that are appearing on the screens of the theaters. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is that kind of film that you leave the cinema and cannot wait to see the next one."
"Darksidecrew","Null","3","10","1 June 2017"," Best from the DC extended universe yet but still room for better
","Well the DCEU has got off to a pretty rough start but this long gestating Wonder Woman adaptation is a step in the right direction. For a start it feels like a real film, with time to set things up properly, character development and a color pallet that looks like a film rather than a de-saturated computer game. Not unlike Captain America: The First Avenger, this has a period setting that breaths some fresh air into it. Set in World War One, Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot)wants to end the great war and is surrounded by some interesting characters led by Chris Pine (Hell Over High Water) as the love interest. The third act is where it falls apart for me, it feels messy and the support characters are given very little to do. I can imagine a handful of scenarios that would have been more thrilling while sitting on my chuff for five minutes. Still on the whole this is a good adventure and hopefully we will see some good things from the Aquaman movie... I am not holding my breath on the Justice League film."

","It's that bad. I'm not even sure why I'm giving this mess 3 stars. There's so many things wrong, it's easier to point out the few good things. I mean I guess the fighting scenes were okay (for example, the Amazons' training at the beginning was nice), there was obviously some money put into things like set, costumes etc (production value), and I must admit that Chris Pine was quite charming ... at least compared to Gal Gadot, who unfortunately can't act, leading to heaps of cringe-inducing moments (I'm sorry, but Wonder Woman is portrayed like an imbecile).
Apart from that, the story was bonkers, the character development was non-existent, there were more plot-holes than things that made sense, the humor was off ... But what irked me the most was that all things combined, Wonder Woman bored me to death. I don't expect a superhero movie to be Oscar-material, but I want to be able to follow the story, get immersed into a different world that is fictional but makes sense in itself, I want to feel with the protagonists and I want to be entertained. All of that didn't happen here. I don't know if I'll ever waste my time watching a DC movie again to be honest ... Wonder Woman, you stink!"

","I have to ask, why is this movie so well regarded? I heard nothing but praise from everyone I talked to before watching this movie. So when I sat down to finally watch it I was expecting something pretty decent. What I got was...adequate at its best, and quite insulting at its worst. <br/><br/>Dianna begins the movie incredibly naive. This is fine and perfectly appropriate for someone who has never seen the world. But here's the problem: she never learns anything. Worse than that, her naïveté is encouraged and rewarded at every step. When everyone is telling her not to rush in blindly and she does so anyway, it all works out and she was right all along. All those people were just being callous or cowardly for not rushing in to help every innocent they saw. I don't want to put a spoiler tag so I'll avoid specifics, but I just found this insulting, both to my own intelligence as a viewer and especially to the millions of men who died in the Great War. <br/><br/>Historical accuracy is hardly that important for a superhero movie, so this is not a huge deal, but I have to ask, why General Ludendorff? He's a pretty significant historical figure after the war ends, playing a pretty central role in Hitler's rise to power. Maybe using him was not the smartest move given what they did with him, particularly as it was a completely unnecessary choice. <br/><br/>Apart from Dianna's issues above (basically the entirety of the story) the film itself was...OK. The action was good, the acting was pretty good all around. Gal Gadot did a great job showing a mix of innocence and righteousness. David Thewlis as always was fantastic in his ability to go from utter calm civility to raging intensity in no time flat. Costume design was pretty good, and the soundtrack was awesome. <br/><br/>Bottom line: if you're only watching this movie to see an awesome Wonder Woman kick ass, you'll love it. If you are looking for a story that makes any kind of sense, shows any kind of character growth, and encourages a morality beyond that of a 6-year-old, don't watch this movie."
"JWBly","4","3","11","21 October 2017"," Gadot - wonderful! The rest of the film? Not so much. :(
","I finally got around to watching WONDER WOMAN last night. Despite its popularity and all the rave reviews, it is mediocre at best. Gal Gadot herself is wonderful and a perfect choice for the part. She is able to project both the strength, courage and determination of a superhero, as well as empathy, love and happiness with equal ease. Her lithe, athletic form fits well into the costume, highlighting her natural sexiness. She is every bit the fighter you would expect, the worthy successor to the warrior tradition of her mother and her aunt. <br/><br/>The scenes on her home island are the best in the film. I enjoyed watching the character as a young child and later beginning her training. Robin Wright again demonstrates her acting skills in a small but memorable role as Antiope. The training and battle sequences on the island are a pleasure to watch. The use of super slow-motion is truly amazing.<br/><br/>But then of course, it is time for our young heroine to leave the island....and the movie promptly falls apart. The entire storyline becomes absolutely ludicrous. And I don't mean ""comic-book"" silly, I mean downright stupid. The grossly-overrated Chris Pine is hopelessly overmatched by Gadot, and the ancillary characters are the predictable group of politically-correct caricatures. Half the characters in the film could simply have been written out completely. The final superhero battle does restore some dignity, but not as much as it should. By that point, the ridiculous plot had so insulted my intellect and wasted my time that I had already begun to check my watch – which is always my personal gauge for a film's success or failure. <br/><br/>Watch this film, just to see Gal Gadot. She really is the embodiment of a superhero. But even her superior strength can't drag the baggage of this train wreck through to the end."

"reza_86","2","3","11","5 September 2017"," Over-hyped
","First of all, this movie only made money because it's a superhero movie, don't get me wrong, I love superhero movies and i wanted to like Wonder Woman, but I just can't get aboard the hype train. <br/><br/>** Here's why this movie sucks on its own merits: **<br/><br/>Movie part: <br/><br/>-For a superhero movie the CGI was horribly bad (they were also poorly edited). It is so obvious. I kept wondering if this movie was made in the early 2000's!!! How poorly can such an expensive movie use such bad camera angles in front of something as simple as a green screen? And every action scene was in slow motions! you can't do that!!!<br/><br/>-The first half of the movie was sooo slow I had to hold my eyes open To prevent me from falling asleep, then the rest I couldn't make sense Of the movie and I really don't think the writers knew either. Wonder A woman stumbles through the movie like a naive 15 year old imbecile who Hasn't hit puberty yet., she's a goddess for crying out loud (I know they tried to make it obvious she was a stranger to the World she just Entered, but for love of Gods they didn't have to make her stupid!!), the logic for not telling her who she really is, screwed up the movie . The way she kills Ares at the end, could have been achieved by telling her who she really was earlier, granted, it would have been a short movie but better. <br/><br/>-And me-Wow, she can talk different languages such superhero powers very amazing! I don't get why they tried to make it so obvious, they could have focused on something else.<br/><br/>-i didn't get why they had to show different races so obviously i mean, come on skirt, hat,... Are we 8?<br/><br/>Gal Gadot part: <br/><br/>-First of all, she was not a good choice for WW, physically amazon ladies are not stick thin models surviving on a lettuce leaf diet. and i don't get why everyone was praising the ""Israeli actress"" ,She had this weird accent and when she talked, she did this extra head movement which looked ridiculous. also bad bad acting oh my god.<br/><br/>-It seemed like Gal Gadot was constantly posing for a photo shoot instead of acting!! I don't know if it was all the feminists that boosted the rating of this movie, if it was that's extremely sad.<br/><br/>Logic/mythology:<br/><br/>-WW's aunt sacrifices her life so that WW doesn't get shot from behind early in the movie. Later in the movie the villain tells her she's a god and only a god can kill a god. This renders her aunt's sacrifice an act of suicide because the movie went out of its way to tell the audience that all the Amazon Women knew she was a god. <br/><br/>-WW's mom, the queen, tells everyone not to do something only to have everyone disobey her. Not just once, but EVERY time she says don't do something, someone does exactly the opposite. I.E.

This sounds odd and forced in a Greek setting. <br/><br/>Humor:<br/><br/>-They dedicated a continuous 15-20 min segment and it all stems from the cultural differences between the Amazonians and humans.

It's the same material stretched for 15 mins <br/><br/>Music: Not bad. Not memorable either. in other word, Meh.<br/><br/>**Overall, this is a bad movie, made not to entertain but a quick money maker with main selling point: ""Female Lead"". Very overrated.

","Oh dear, this was awful. After all the hyped reviews for this movie I thought there might finally be a DC movie worth watching and was looking forward to checking it out.

She looks amazing but seriously, she can not act. At.

It's full of inconsistencies, poor logic, one dimensional characters etc etc<br/><br/>I lasted about 45 minutes before my attention wandered on to more interesting things (that I lasted that long is entirely down to Chris Pine who is the only bright spark in this). If it gets better after that I probably will never attempt to find out. <br/><br/>One star for Gadot's Zoolander 'Blue Steel' impressions + 2 for Chris Pine = a generous 3 stars."
"kimberlymckayauthor","10","3","11","27 August 2017"," Worth it
","From start to finish, this film was spellbinding. From the second it came on screen, an action-filled soundtrack paired with flat two-dimensional graphics flooded the screen & allowed a glimpse of Wonder Woman's journey in life before she evolved into a pop culture world-while phenomenon. Her Amazon spirit set an entirely different tone for anyone who was used to the television version of Diana Prince.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot, an Isreali actress, martial arts expert, and model easily stepped into the tall boots of the warrior princess and made the transition making us feel she wasn't just an actress playing a part. She breathed the essence of Diana, Princess of Themyscira - originally known in DC comics as Paradise Island. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman showcases how loyal and fierce women can be in the same breath. It colors a bold picture of how hard we fight when there's a cause while still respecting the softer side of life. Diana showcases this brilliantly as she champions forth in her battles kicking ass and saving the world all in the name of love.<br/><br/>The romantic chemistry between Gadot and Pine was just enough to paint a vivid picture of what happens behind closed doors, without being blatant or obscene. I loved the tenderness between these two. Their love symbolized so much in this film ... but again, I don't want to give any of the details away. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this film for men and women alike as there's plenty of gore, action, and fight scenes that will satisfy the male population while providing insight into the female psyche offering a glimpse of humanity, tenderness, and passion for humankind."

Acting was bad. They should of paired down this movie to 90 minutes and removed some of the silly dialog that Gadot was saying. Some of the special effects were cheesy and looks like DC movies might be in trouble. This was tough to get through....even with my 12 year old son. I used to collect comic books and watch ALL the superhero movies. And out of all the Superhero movies I rated, this is above only a few (Green Lantern) being one of them. After 5 years of ratings, this fake 7.9 rating which stands today will drop to a solid 6. All in all....this movie is entertaining for a 10-16 year old and then it drops off from there. If you do watch this movie and ignore this review, enjoy the boredom and cheesy acting."
"j-d-ignatius","8","3","11","8 July 2017"," Depth beyond Marvel, and a step up since Nolan
","I love the Marvel films, but in my opinion, the best superhero movies to be adapted to film are the Christopher Nolan Batman films. I consider these films to be the only ones that truly depict the complexity of the characters that were developed in the comics (even if they took some liberal assumptions into plotting). To the Non-Comic readers... don't lose me here. <br/><br/>What I think is great about comics is the depth of which the characters are, or at least are intended to be, developed. They share the same, if somewhat more intense, experiences as typical people face. However, their experiences (combined with resources and abilities) allow them to make a larger impact for good or evil. <br/><br/>Now, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Which again, I love), there is very little depth in character development. First film is always; gifted/rich Person->great tragedy- >overcoming hardships->superhero. Then the following films are simply a new foe. This allows MCU to crank out a new film every six months. However, in the Nolan films there is a depth of character and plot. For example, the underlying theme of fear. In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne overcomes his fear of Bats, utilizes it as a strength, and then fights fear. Fear comes in the form in Batman Begins as ""a panic inducing toxin"" from Scarecrow, derived from a plant developed/provided by the league of shadows. Only by understanding fear is Bruce able to understand the implications of the League of Shadows' attack. In Dark knight, Joker serves as an ""agent of chaos"". Bruce understands this danger and is only able to overcome it through his resources and history with overcoming hardship. In Dark Knight Rises, fear is it in its greatest form.. All of Gotham in the prospect of annihilation. Bruce has already overcome his fear and defeated it, but didn't realize that fear is a necessity if ones intention is to reach true strength, which is a requirement to escape the prison and defeat the films depiction of fear and evil, Bane (again the league of shadows). <br/><br/>Back to Wonder Woman. While not quite to the depth of the Nolan films, there is certainly a depth to her in character development by which she faces the fact that hate and war are innate human instincts. Though they may be instigated by the god, Ares, these traits are ingrained in all humans. This is a learning lesson for her, and one that she overcomes. By overcoming, she develops as a character, an Amazonian away from Themyscira, to a hero (if a confused one). <br/><br/>None of this would be possible without the fantastic character depictions of Chris Pine and Gal Gadot. In summary I would say DC lost its track with suicide squad and batman vs. superman with the depth of plot, but they are on a great track with Wonder Woman. Best of luck for Justice League and beyond!"

","the performance which actress been giving was mentally retarded,i don't understand the blood-line between Wonder Women and Zeus but if the actress was trying to portray a character as progeny of Consanguineous marriage then she will have my applause,because she did it.Basically i consider this film is female version of Captain American after i saw the shield,the WWⅡ scenario,the hyper-strength melee combat ,and when i say that i actually was trying to tell that there was nothing worth to remember .NO twist coming through no plot need be regurgitate ,because there was no plot at all.So i start to think that probably DC really don't know how to make movie."

","DC Comics and Warner Brothers are expanding their universe. After Wonder Woman's appearance in Batman v Superman in 2016, she gets her own standalone film.<br/><br/>In keeping with the Justice League universe, the film has that dark and murky look. We get a long drawn out beginning of a young girl who is a descendant of a Greek god wishing to train to be a warrior despite her mother's resistance to the idea.<br/><br/>We then see a grown up Amazonian princess, Diana (Gal Gadot) who develops little muscular physique despite all her training with fellow warrior sisters on a mystical isolated island of Themyscira.<br/><br/>When an an American pilot Steve (Chris Pine) crashes near this island followed by German soldiers, the Amazonians learn of an outside world where humans are engaged in a great war, the first world war. Diana leaves her island with Steve and goes to London with a desire to stop the war.<br/><br/>Steve has found out about a German chemist called Dr Poison trying to develop chemical weapons that would render gas masks useless in a background of both sides to the war having peace talks. Diane believes that Ares, the god of war is responsible for the human misery caused by warfare. <br/><br/>The film improves once the action moves to London but there are problems with the story. It is weak, when a sinister German general is disposed off well before the end of the film, it just confirms that a certain character is going to be the big bad of the movie.<br/><br/>Some of Steve's ragbag of associates who are there for camaraderie and comic relief are useless. A marksman who cannot shoot.<br/><br/>The film feels overlong and underwhelming. You have to suspend a lot of disbelief in Wonder Woman's acrobatic abilities as well parrying bullets with her wrist bands.<br/><br/>Gadot showed promise in her appearance in Batman v Superman last year, but carrying a film on her own exposed her limitations as an actress. Her range is limited and in many scenes she is just required to pose and replaced by CGI either in slow motion or sped up."

","I'm still wondering why Wonder Woman is currently averaging 8 stars on IMDb. Yes, I appreciate the diction, comedy, interesting romance, and brilliant perspective about humanity that builds up in the first 30 minutes of the movie. That's brilliant. Not something we see often these days. But all of these lovely aspects were ruined by the unbelievably childish show of thrills, unnecessary slow motion effects, not to talk about the annoying game-style graphics. Not the first time we've seen this from DC anyway. (Warning: Spoilers!) Sorry, I can't do this without spoiling a little bit: You realize how much you've lost connection with the characters when a character you love dies and you feel nothing at all. A totally unnecessary death that makes you want to ask for your money back. Then Ares suddenly made himself defeat-able. It made the last battle less enjoyable. Also, you fail to understand the villains' rationales​. People don't just wake up and decide to destroy the world. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I think both users and critics are either ignoring too many flaws in this movie or they are simply being dishonest."

"onestephenis","10","3","11","7 June 2017"," Of course it's not perfect, but...
","Wonder Woman was a serious breath of fresh air. It wasn't just a great comic book movie. It was a great movie period. The script contained no major flaws, though there were things I would have liked to see done a little different. The 'main villain' in almost all the more recent comic book movies have been rather poorly developed and this one is no exception. I guess that's the worst flaw in this movie.<br/><br/>I can tell you what wasn't a flaw. Gal Gadot. When I first heard who was going to play Wonder Woman I looked her up and was baffled. I didn't automatically assume she would suck because that's just not in my nature. I was also shocked that Ben Affleck was cast as Batman, but I actually saw some potential there and I think I was right despite Batman v Superman not being the greatest film. Gal Gadot's performance in that movie was fine but too brief for me to determine how she would do in a stand alone film. Well, she did great. I can, if I'm being honest, see some room for improvement, but I was more than merely satisfied with her performance. As I said, the movie was great and had no major flaws.<br/><br/>There was really only one other truly well developed character and that was played by Chris Pine who I feel might be one of the most underrated actors out there. He gets major roles frequently, sometimes HUGE roles like James T. Kirk, but you rarely hear all that much praise for his acting skills. I hope this movie helps change that. He is practically irresistible in this role and just oozes charm and confidence while somehow never overshadowing our other main hero. The chemistry between our leads is damn near perfect.<br/><br/>This will naturally lead into the romantic subplot. It is so organic and unforced that it is far superior to many 'love stories' that have been made. The mutual admiration, respect and more physical feelings that develop between the main characters is so natural and subtle that if they had tried to leave any romantic interest out it would have been almost obnoxious. She has never seen another man at all and he is far from lacking in good looks or charm. He's 'a little more than average' (hehe, you'll see) and as they travel together she will learn that he is a man of honor, integrity, and is obviously superior to the average man both physically and intellectually. And if you're thinking 'well she's super hot so he's obviously down for it' then you'd misjudge there as well. Of course they are initially physically attracted to each other, but that is the furthest thing from his mind. There's a brutal and horrible war going on killing more and more people everyday and he has to do what he can to stop it. The development of his feelings for her are just as gradual and understandable as hers. He's constantly surprised by her strength and skill for sure, but he is also shocked by her kind-hearted nature and blatant displays of intelligence (she speaks a hundred languages) He sees her almost disabling innocence and naivety slowly get stripped away by the horrors the world begins to show her. She plainly struggles yet she displays an inner strength that matches her physical powers. She shows persistent determination to meet a goal he finds ridiculous (she has to slay the god of war after all) but when faced with obstacles that might slow her down she fights despite being told 'we can't save them all' she tries and when she learns that he was right she doesn't break down. She grits her teeth and marches on. Of course he would fall for her.<br/><br/>Heroes. I've seen so many portrayed. Wonder Woman was possibly the best. Captain America did everything he could to be a hero. He tried desperately to join the military despite being too pathetic to serve. He agreed to risk death to try to become something more. He lead men into battle and fought with courage. But he wanted that glory and he got it.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman has no interest in glory. She wanted to be a warrior because that's what every single person she had ever known was. So what else COULD she have aspired to become? She has a singular goal to fulfill a destiny she never asked for. She goes out into the world knowing nothing about it except that she had a duty to protect it. All along the way she sees pain and suffering. She sees people she can help, but keeps going because she thinks she must. Her drive and determination are relentless and more than admirable, but then she breaks... or does she? She finally steps up. She climbs out of that trench and in that moment you realize that this woman is a freaking hero not just a superhero, she somehow makes THAT title seem like less. She puts her endless drive to the side and saves the day. When she wins the day and praise is heaped on her she accepts it graciously, but it is obvious that that was never the goal. When it all turns out to have been in vain she does not crumble, but she isn't perfectly stoic about it either. She feels more human to us than ever. When the final confrontation approaches and she is faced with the challenge of defeating the god of war himself she is not going into the fight thinking she is making some kind of sacrifice. She has some doubts, but she is confident. She believes in her ability to accomplish what seems impossible. But at no point does she ever seem actually arrogant in any way. She is simply performing a duty. Facing her destiny head on."

","Wonder Woman is directed by Patty Jenkins and stars Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, David Thewlis, Danny Huston, Saïd Taghmaoui and Ewen Bremner.<br/><br/>Before she was Wonder Woman she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained warrior. When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, she leaves home to fight a war to end all wars, discovering her full powers and true destiny. (12A cert; 141 mins)<br/><br/>The DC Extended Universe (DCEU) is now in full swing. We've seen Superman take flight, Batman battling evil in Gotham, and the Suicide Squad fighting the bad with bad. Now, it's time to welcome a new hero; Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins has received a lot of praise from fans and critics alike as Wonder Woman takes the world by storm. It's clear why; she's a very talented director and skilled within the action genre. Some of the action sequences are wonderfully captured, it's easy to follow and smooth in the edit. She understands the characters and directs the two leads well. Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are both incredible in their respective roles. Their writing is realistic, you care for them both, truly. However, the screenplay is just as bland as the other DCEU entries. It's funny and inviting, but as the film progresses in its slow pace, the layers start to uncover, revealing its generic story and predictable outcome. Gadot's Wonder Woman is fierce, bold, beautiful. She and Pine are the saving grace, that goes without saying, but the overdose of CGI and the exaggerated yet anti-climatic finale left me feeling empty.<br/><br/>That said, it is without a doubt the best DCEU instalment yet, in terms of production and performances. The WWI setting is gritty and dark, as it should be. We get to see how Diana reacts to the evils of war and that was a really nice direction. We see her vulnerable, but we also see her stronger than ever. You'll leave the theatre thinking about one scene in particular; No Man's Land. It's beautifully crafted with some goosebump-worthy moments. I'm sure it'll go down as one of the most memorable scenes in DCEU history.<br/><br/>Rupert Gregson-Williams' original score is powerfully moving. There's a moment where Tina Guo skilfully performs Hans Zimmer's kick-ass Wonder Woman theme in one of the most rewarding fights I've seen. Rupert's music is action-packed, but it's the grounded connection between Diana and Steve where he truly delivers. It's a delightful score and functionally superb.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film, it's still enjoyable as a stand-alone Wonder Woman epic. Just don't go ahead with high expectations, you'll more than likely leave disappointed. Perhaps I expected too much, given the flooding positive response. There's a lot that could have gone wrong, making it as lacklustre as BvS and Suicide Squad, but it stood up and at least tried to tell a unique and fulfilling story. Above all else, the evolution of Gadot's Wonder Woman is inspiring to watch.<br/><br/>Verdict; Gal Gadot & Chris Pine are both wonderful and deliver some truly beautiful moments, but the story lacks momentum, suffering pacing issues and becoming just as tedious as the other DCEU entries.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman – ★★★ (6/10)"

","Wonder woman begins with Bruce Wayne asking her to tell him her story, which she does, but to us. Lets go over the plot. It has a weak villain which for one I hate the most in a movie. If you have a villain , make it strong. Like Joker in the Dark Knight or Bane in The Dark Knight Rises( Both were DC films ). But the film becomes a mere showcase for Diana to show us her talents and that also for a handful of moments that too come in the last half of the film. The CGI does look bad in a few scenes. However that's not too bad CGI. The acting department, I must say the men in the movie did a better job then Gal. Especially, Chris Pine who for one didn't even need a dialogue to tell you what he feels. The action sequences are average and less than what I was expecting. The film is slow at times and the uneven pace is to it's disadvantage. The film's humor really holds up the movie along with the dramatic scenes, but for one I feel it's a bit over rated. Nevertheless, a welcome improvement from the DCEU, it will surely be remembered. I will definitely go to The Justice League with lower expectations . By the way, there are no post credit scenes."

The screenplay was horrendous, with dialogues so stupid it was like the script was written by the nine years old daughter of the producer. In kid movies I've seen more professionality than in this hundred millions dollars budgeted one. The acting was awful and mediocre, and only Chris Pine and Gal Gadot had characters with an actual personality. This personality was banal and static, yes, but at least the movie didn't get an 1 star rating for this. The bad guy is the WORST VILLAIN I HAVE EVER SEEN. Seriously, it's just ridiculous. Both Ares and the german officer were so stupid and nonsense that I laughed hard every time they were on screen. And finally, it follows Pearl Harbor in the side of historical veridicity, with some aspects that made me quite angry. The german soldiers look like static enemies of chinese RPGs, like statues with a bullseye drawn on the forehead. What? The war is a serious theme, and if you want to make a movie about the Great War, you make a pearl that describes accurately every little aspect of the trench life, the horror of war and the condition of the soldiers, or either you stop being a producer and start picking up manure along the train rails. Please. I think that if a german ww1 soldier watches this movie (they're all dead, but whatever), he would probably kill himself. How can you enjoy watching this commercial excrement comed out of mother Hollywood's big ass? How can this have so high ratings? This is not sufficient at all. How a mistake. DC is definitely dead."

"feyipuk","4","2","6","9 June 2018"," Needs more depth
","Given the amount of material produced by DC, the film lacks the substance of the multitude of other superhero films being produced at the moment. 
The film starts with Diana (Lilly Aspell) living on an idyllic Greek looking island. We don't know where or what time period she grows up in (and it seems like she is the only one who does grow up), honing her skills and learning huge amounts, but suddenly the First World War arrives on her doorstep, in the shape of Chris Pine as Steve Trevor and changes her life. <br/><br/>Following on from Dawn of Justice - and lets face it, pretty much everyone knows the Batman and Superman back stories - it makes sense to have an origin story for Wonder Woman for those who don't know who she is (and it would have been good to have an Aquaman (2018) and Cyborg (2020!!!!) film before the Justice League film, but ho-hum).
Yet, considering scale of the backdrop of WW1, the camera spends an inordinate amount of time looking straight at Dianas face when they could have spent more time on the plot. DC seem to love these pretentious posing shots, evident through out all the recent films, when they could go back to the Christian Bale style Batman style, or even the Michael Keaton era that at least has some humour and engaging plots.<br/><br/>The supporting cast carry the main character, but could have done with more screen time. Connie Nielsen (Hippolyta) and Robin Wright (Antiope) have such presence on the screen as sword wielding, Amazonian warriors and balance nicely with the Lucy Davis (Etta), as a feisty London secretary, and Elena Anaya (Dr. Maru) as a sadistic chemical expert. All these women play pivotal roles in the film and I wish they'd had more lines.<br/><br/>Sadly, Saïd Taghmaoui (Sameer), Ewen Bremner(Charlie) and Eugene Brave Rock (The Chief) I think could have been used better; seemingly deep characters with a similar camaraderie as Marvels Howling Commandos, yet they're more played as foils to help Diana better understand the ""world of men"". You can't miss that you have a native American working with an American on a mission to stop a group of people who've invaded another nation. <br/><br/>Looking at DC's list of future films, it looks like Diana Prince will be around for a few years to come, and maybe we'll get some more flash backs to better expand on this wonderful character."

The acting was mediocre at best (Robin Wright's character, Antiope, most of all) and the ""Amazon kingdom"", where Diana (Wonder Woman) is from, felt hastily pieced together. Once the film leaves the island, however, things improve quite a bit. <br/><br/>Now on to some positives. I felt that the supporting cast did an excellent job in this film. Chris Pine delivers another solid performance, which is to be expected these days. Danny Huston puts in a believable performance as the evil German general and, in my opinion, served as the best antagonist in the film. Ewen Bremner also does a good job in his usual ""silly character"" role which has seemingly followed him since his first big performance in ""Trainspotting"". Gal Gadot does a fine job in the leading role, delivering what I felt was a fairly authentic performance overall. <br/><br/>This film takes place during the Great War of 1918 which was an intriguing choice in my opinion. The setting seems pretty believable considering the context, which helps draw you into the film. The action scenes are, for the most part, well executed and aren't so frequent as to compromise the plot. This film does have a semblence of a plot, too, which is a big reason why I liked it. Many superhero movies forgo the plot for constant action, which luckily ""Wonder Woman"" does not do. This allows us a chance to spend some time with the interesting characters. I felt the humor in this film was really well done as well, and did not seem forced like so many movies do. It also fit the time period fairly well. <br/><br/>The ending has it's issues, but overall I felt it climaxed at the proper time and ended at the proper time as well. While the runtime is quite long (2 hours 20 minutes), it never felt dull apart from the first 25 minutes or so. There is one particularly emotional scene right before the end that I felt was really well done, especially for a movie such as this. The conclusion leaves room for sequels like all superhero movies do, and while I don't really care for these types of endings, it was expected nonetheless. <br/><br/>Overall this film is indeed flawed, but I still enjoyed it as a whole. it is certainly not worthy of all these 1 star reviews it is receiving (is this movie seriously on par with Battlefield: Earth? I think not). While I was hesitant to watch it, in the end i'm glad I did. Watch it for yourself before passing judgement and see if you agree with me. This is the best DC movie thus far in my opinion, and well worth the chance."
"alexandregatineau","6","2","6","30 January 2018"," Disappointing
","Why is it disappointing? Because people hyped this so much, it got so much attention and good reviews, I was expecting to be mind blown.<br/><br/>Have you seen Captain America? Or like, any other super hero movie? Yes, that's another one. There's nothing original, just an origin story. How about ""a hero with beyond human strength wearing american colors to fight germans under the influence of an evil force"". Captain America or Wonder woman? Both. Oh I forgot they even went as far as having a suicide in a bomber in the end. <br/><br/>I could have given this movie 7 stars but there's something I can't ignore: the CGI. Marvel movies, you like them or you hate them, your opinion. But you can't deny that, everything looks real. Iron man, the flying ship in the avengers etc etc, it looks real. This movie, what the hell, you can see everything is green background, they tried so hard making it look beautiful like the amazon island that it looks way too fake. Same for the fighting scenes. Big meh. <br/><br/>I don't know if Gal Gadot is a good actress, but in this movie, she's been asked to be naïve and incredibly pretty, which she does. <br/><br/>Music is okay, the main wonder woman theme we discovered in Batman V superman is there, but maybe not enough. <br/><br/>Anyway, no, it's not different than your average origin movie. It's entertaining alright but way too predictable and the CGI isn't even close to what Marvel does. Small fact: my girlfriend found it pretty cringe worthy and was laughing all the way through the final fight because, for some reason, the villain speaks and screams as cliché as possible ""I will destroy youuuu, hahaha, I'm evil"". You get the idea."

","This film is an abomination. Terrible script, clunky dialogue, stupid plot, frankly weird imagination by whoever concocted it. Who on earth and in what studio could have bought this idea?: er, let's take an iconic female super hero steeped in irony, pazazz, style and gender-subtext and plant her in a grey blood stained doom-laden first world war trench scenario where people are getting their arms and legs blown off, that is if they manage to survive the gas poisoning of course. How many grams must have been consumed at the studio planning sessions to come up with this drivel? My guess? Many. First principle here: make sure there can be one or more (preferably 3 or 4 or 5) sequels to the movie. And prequels of course. This is by far the most important thing. Dollars in abundance. Next, add 95% CGI. CGI cor! and wow! - how impressive. Is the year actually 2003 and I've over-slept? Dull dull dull. Look at our software, Clever innit? Next, recreate 'Indiana Jones...' but with a female lead. And in WW1 trenches!! With gas... Brilliant idea!!! Next: it's OK to slaughter literally hundreds of German soldiers, because obviously they were all nasty evil baddies and the Allies were all goody goody freedom fighters. (Er, sorry, but in reality the slaughtered - slaughtered by the film's 'heroes' - German soldiers would actually have been conscripts just like the Allied soldiers were. Doing what they were told). I really hope this movie does not become a history lesson/synopsis/precis to anyone, anywhere. Read some history books, quick. And, finally, to have the audacity to try to trowel on to this mess of a film some kind of humanitarian anti-war message??!! The final insult to one's intelligence in a long series of insults to one's intelligence. Seriously? Let's bring world peace by killing everybody who isn't in our team?? Ye gods. Ye Gods....

","While this movie is far from perfect and seems to be getting good reviews, a lot of critics seem to have a vendetta against it. As a person who has seen lots of films and love both Marvel and DC equally I don't get why it's a lot of fun. The plot is well... wonder woman. An Amazonian Princess who gets brought to the real world to supposedly stop Ares the god of war, it's a fish out of water scenario. It's easily the best DC movie made in a while, whether or not you think that may vary but personally it definitely holds up on being a wonder-ful.<br/><br/>I'm really glad we finally did get a Wonder Woman movie because we really don't get much of her (excluding the fun 70s show). I'd say it's easily worth checking out but still isn't a masterpiece like the dark knight trilogy or Superman. I guess I'm pretty split, I'm NO RalphTheMovieMaker but I am not going to instantly praise it but I'll still give credit where it is do. It has a lot of heart.<br/><br/>Go take the family or buy it, It's a lot of fun and has decent acting all around. Gal Gadot really did steal the show though,so good on her.

"jay-techie2007","7","2","6","1 September 2017"," Could have been much better. But still a good watch, especially as it breaks into the male dominated superhero world. Bravo to Gal Gadot!!
","A good watch, overall. It is a bit high on melodrama and they fail to do the justice to the character of Wonder Woman with weak background story. Having said that, Gal Gadot definitely gave her best, even though I feel she was more intimidating in FF franchise. <br/><br/>Story (6/10): There is a fine line between sounding fascinating and sounding ridiculous and I guess the writers here crossed that line. Set up in the era of WW2 (1930s and 40s), Princess Diana of Amazon is raised in a well protected - all ladies - environment among female warriors of Amazon in a remote island where she is the only kid. As she grows up, she realizes her potential and super powers. The island is specially protected to prevent any attack from their nemesis, Ares. However, Diana has her first encounter with the real world when Steve crashes his plane near the island and Diana comes to know about the world war. This triggers her to help Steve end the war by killing Areas (who she thinks is responsible for the war) and, in the process, ends up discovering her true supernatural powers. The beginning of the story was very weak and that almost killed the story department. Certain events were inexplicable and not coherent with the events shown a couple of scenes back. Screenplay was much better than the story per se - some of the punches, especially related to Diana's first encounter in the real world were great. <br/><br/>Acting (8/10): Clearly it was Gal Gadot's movie and she dominated very well. Her natural aggression without putting up explicit expressions gave her a good edge when playing a super woman. Her chemistry with Chris Pine was perhaps the next best thing in the movie. Chris Pine was amazing to watch. Besides the lead pair, two other characters made a very strong presence felt in the movie, Danny Huston and David Thewlis. Danny Huston was brilliant, playing a very intimidating character of Ludendorff - a German General. David Thewlis, playing Sir Patrick - a member of the Supreme War Council of Allied forces in WW2, was great to watch. <br/><br/>Direction (7/10): Patty Jenkins made a good effort with a little weak story at hand. The pacing of the movie was quite good. With the above average length, he perhaps ended up creating more than required which could have been edited out. The climax, in particular, was quite long with hyper melodramatic sequences which tested the patience of the audience. His use of Diana's character, who was experiencing the male dominated world for the first time to convey an unbiased view of how things should be in an ideal world, was great. Aesthetically as well, the movie was made really well. <br/><br/>Overall (7/10): Definitely to be watched, especially as it breaks into the male dominated superhero world. Bravo to Gal Gadot, whom we would love to see more in such strong characters - even if not a superhero."
"wackywhovian11","7","2","6","2 August 2017"," Girl Power!!!
","My review of Wonder Woman (2017)<br/><br/>Girl Power overload is what this film is really about. Gal Gabot plays the Amazing Amazon Woman aka Wonder Woman who was created by the all powerful Zeus and raised to be the ulitmate warrior and defender of the earth. Now that we have our introduction of the film written let's get into reviewing this film. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman aka Diana had never seen a man and when a WWII pilot crashes on the secluded island and goes to save him because it's in her nature to save humanity and becomes fascinated by Steve Trevor played by Chris Pine. Steve opens up Diana world with learning how to act in society from dancing and dressing in normal clothing. <br/><br/>The film takes place in WWII when war is everywhere and Diana wants to help take down her enemies Aries who is really another name for Hitler if you ask me BUT let's not split hairs here. During the war scenes is when Diana really shows her true strength and some of my favorite scenes. <br/><br/>I wasn't a huge Wonder Woman when I was growing up but this film was really entertaining and made me look up the TV show and get some comic books from the library and when a movie can do that it's a win win for me. Should you watch this film? Well if you like superhero films then yes, you'll like this film. The first female superhero to be number one at the Box Office and make 700 Million dollars so far isn't bad for a girl power film. If you're not sure about the film rent it on Redbox it'll only cost you a few dollars but you'll enjoy it."
"oscarholmstrand","7","2","6","28 July 2017"," Decent movie not amazing but for sure not bad either, it does not deserve all the praise it get's when it's just okay Imo
","Waning spoilers will ensue.<br/><br/>I see so much praise for wonder woman but I don't really get it, I think Gal Godot is an average actress at most, I like her personality but her acting was very meh in wonder woman, she looked the part for sure and seeing her kick ass was to me awesome. To me the meh pretty much sums up the whole wonder woman movie, it's kinda meh. Chris pine to me was great, good comedic timing but you still bought him as a spy and a guy who knew how to fight. The general was also very meh to me. But the problem to me wasn't so much the leads as it was some of the weird plot points, the use of to much slow mo in my opinion and the poor character development for the side characters. The Irish guy had a decent arc but nothing that made me care much about him same with the Indian guy, he was charming and funny but there was no real substance to the character it was like they brought substance to one character and interesting personality to the other. I loved the guy the great sir who played Ares he was amazing and he kinda had shades of gray to him, I think that they could have handled the last act with him a little better because there was not much set up for him turning into the god of war you would expect. <br/><br/>That is also another thing that didn't bother me about the movie at all but is something I think could have improved the movie slightly, Greek mythology, I personally love Greek mythology and the terrifically horrible nature of it which I think could have been slightly explored at least. Also the god-killer thing was to me apparent as soon as you saw the mom linger for the sword then went like OK!, her linger was enough for me to get that Diana was the god-killer, like OK she is the only child born and she was sent by Zeus, ofc it is her but they had to beat it over your head for the next 15 min of the movie with Robin wrights death and all. The reveal of her being a god was to me awesome though and the beating it over my head did not in fact ruin that, I thought she could just kill Ares cuz ya know magic or w/e but the god reveal was exciting but also made me even more mad over the fact that superman sacrificed himself like an idiot when wonder woman is literally unkillable except by another god. Random BvS side track aside the movie was just average to me and I don't get the praise it get's. Yes it was a female lead super hero movie but we have had bad ass women lead movies before so I don't see the reason for just this particular one to be so praised.<br/><br/>Also I seemed to like the side characters action more than wonder woman's at some points, some of her action scenes were freaking awesome but all of the scenes with the military guys were equally or sometimes even more awesome, maybe it has to do with the fact that they were more relatable or maybe it was just that Patty Jenkins shoots amazing war cinema. And the weird plot points like why when Chris Pine does not let Gal Gadot kill the general does she run outside instead of running towards the general swinging her sword? The whole ball scene was kind off useless to me except to show of Chris Pine's acting skills.<br/><br/>TL; DR Wonder woman was to me decent had some good performances some meh and the same goes for the plot and the action some parts where woo F yeah and some were... meh. Definitely not a bad movie but not the great movie it is praised to be"
"alexanderlchen","7","2","6","18 July 2017"," Great movie with good casting but bad plot (SPOILER ALERT)
","As much as I liked the movie, I did think that the movie lacked substance in the story/plot and in character development. When we first see Diana as a child, we learn that she wants to learn how to fight and loves to fight. We don't see this in the context of a moral crusade or a belief of helping other's in the movie which leads me to ask the question, does Wonder Woman love the people she is fighting to save or does she innately love fighting? Adding some context in those childhood scenes of seeing her use fighting as a last resort to help another person I think would have been more powerful/effective in her character development. <br/><br/>Second, I thought the movie tried to evoke emotions that it had not devoted time investing in. For example, when the village at the end is bombed with the gas and everyone dies in it, we know no one in the village so we, as an audience, are tempted not to care. Adding a scene where we see the humanity and life of the village (a few montage shots to allow us to empathize and care about the villagers) or the introduction of a few villagers whom we feel we know intimately changes the story from a bombed village to the loss of good people. I did love the investment and development of the two main characters, Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor. The buildup of the relationship between Steve and Wonder Woman makes that last scene so wrenching because we actually care about Steve and see his good heart and selflessness. We don't get that kind of emotional investment in the villagers so it isn't a sacrifice that evokes the same amount of emotion. <br/><br/>Lastly, I think DC needs to make better villains because I was able to figure out who Ares was early on in the movie. I like the added dimensionality that Ares brings but I felt that his character portrayal, introduction, and impact on the store could have been much improved. I personally felt as though leading us to believe the German commander was Ares was a bit cheesy and needed some modification too. <br/><br/>I think casting for this movie was fantastic and my biggest qualms with DC movies isn't the casting but rather the sub par story-telling and plot. I'm starting to see a trend with DC movies and in my opinion, the biggest weaknesses are the villains (lack of depth), great casting with bad plots/stories, and lack of emotional investment (i.e. the people Amanda Waller kills in Suicide Squad or the villagers in Wonder Woman)."

Summary, system of organization of the characters copied to MCU, too much time spent on the primary character, less on the secondary and almost nothing on the development of the villain, which makes the third act completely unnecessary and silly"
"jediknight190501","7","2","6","3 July 2017"," Can War itself be made obsolete? Wonder Woman hopes it can.
","Most superhero action films are long on the action, and short on any real meaning. By that I mean films like ""Spiderman,"" ""The Avengers,"" and the endless series of sequels to those films and others serve to entertain us without actually making any kind of statement. Most of the angst provided by the aforementioned films deals with the personal lives of the heroes, and they generally don't take the time to comment on the reality we live in. ""Wonder Woman"" is really not like those movies in that regard. Sure, it entertains, but it also says something about what is happening in our world today.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" is set during the Great War (WWI), mostly. The film is as much about the horrors of war and the never ending conflict between human beings as it is about a superhero saving the day in daring and dashing fashion. The film begins in the present day and quickly moves to the past and a mysterious hidden island inhabited by female warriors called Amazons. We are all familiar with the Amazon concept, but the film explains their origins and why they are here.<br/><br/>Young Diana (Lily Aspell) is the only child on the island, daughter of the Amazon queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) (although Diana's actual origins are mysterious). The queen is protective of her child and doesn't want her to train with the other warriors. Of course the young girl wants to learn how to fight so badly she manages to get some training from Hippolyta's sister, Antiope (Robin Wright). It should be noted that both Nielsen and Wright are very good in their all too brief appearances in the film.<br/><br/>When an airplane breaches the secrecy of the island and crashes just off the beach, a now older Diana (Gal Gadot) rescues the pilot, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). She learns from him about the Great War being fought in the outside world, and Diana knows she must leave the island to find what she believes is the root cause of the conflict, the god Ares. She believes that by stopping (killing) Ares, she can put an end to war itself.<br/><br/>Diana gets a last name, Prince, from Trevor after she travels with him to London, England, and there are some amusing sequences because of her obvious naiveté and lack of experience with our world. Diana is kind of a wide eyed innocent, a lethal wide eyed innocent I might add, and Trevor has to keep her in line as best as he can. Ultimately the pair of them are joined by some of Trevor's less than respectable friends, Sameer (Said Taghmaoui), Charlie (Ewen Bremner), and The Chief (Eugene Brave Rock). Together the group heads to the front lines in search of Ares, and an end to War.<br/><br/>Directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster), the film's pacing is a strong point, as it never moves along too fast or too slowly. ""Wonder Woman"" is not a great movie, but it is a good one and worthy of being considered one of the best of the DC series of films."

","When finally it arrives, ""Wonder Woman"" delivers all the power you could wish for. Gal Gadot really shows impressive dedication to the role.<br/><br/>Director Patty Jenkins, who directed Charlize Theron in her legendary depiction of Aileen Wuornos in ""Monster"" (2003), was offered to helm this historic screen adaptation, despite only having one feature film on her résumé. Apart from some faltering CGI (which, regrettably, seems to have become a standard in blockbusters of late, despite the technical powers at display), there cannot be much negative to say about the craftsmanship. Jenkins and her actors (David Thewlis, not the least) do what they are supposed to. The design is impressive. Rupert Gregson-Williams score is a mighty one. All in all, it's a nice ride. If only we'd not seen the formula used a million times before."
"matrixpolaris","7","2","6","22 June 2017"," Great. Until the last 3rd of the movie.
","(Contains major spoilers!!)<br/><br/>Most, if not all critics think that Wonder Woman is the best movie in the DCEU. And I can understand why. But I would have to go with Man of Steel here. But I'll start with the positives. The acting is superb. The cast is perfect for their roles, and Diana is very likable. They wrote the characters very well, and because Diana ends up in a Crocodile Dundee-like situation, her naivety makes her even more likable and innocent (until she kills over a hundred German Soldiers of course). There is quite a bit of humour in the film, and it usually succeeds. And the action is for the most part quite good. There are also quite a few standout sequences, for example, the action scene at the Amazon fortress, the scene at the Front Line, and Diana's training. The first 2 thirds are great. The action, the time they spend in London, etc. But then it all crumbled down.<br/><br/>The Negatives: The only bad thing about the first 2 thirds, was probably the CGI. A lot of it just looks quite fake, and making Wonder Woman have the same super jumping powers Daredevil 2003 had, was a bad idea. Sorry, but she is no Spider-man. But there's a lot of bad things in the last bit of the film. A few people have already said this, but I just have to repeat it. The twist that Professor Lupin is Ares made absolutely no sense. Lupin wanted the peace treaty in the first place didn't he? But Ludendorf being Ares was pretty logical. He wanted the war to go on. He surprisingly knew quite a bit about the Greek Gods. And he had a weird superhuman potion with him too. Now, in my opinion, a much better ending would be with Wonder Woman realising that humans aren't just good, but are a mishmash between good and bad, and killing Ares won't change that. And that seems to be the whole message of the movie. But instead, Diana gets into a big, cliché superhero battle with Ares, realises she is actually a god (?), and kills Ares. The next day, the war is over, because Ares was controlling the men after all. And everything was happy ever after. Until WW2."

I don't know what happened there. He was so good in the ""Harry Potter"" movies, but here, he hammed it up a bit too much to the point where it was almost laughable. The action sequences were well done and the score was also great. My only other criticism is the film did move a bit fast in the beginining. The exposition should have been drawn out a bit longer because it was hard for me to transition to the next part of the story that quickly. I'm surprised that so many people liked this. Not because it's a bad film. I enjoyed it too, but because as of late DC has been the scapegoat in the superhero movie game. So if this pleased even a bunch of nitpickers, then you know it's good.

","Unfortunately just like the new Ghostbusters film, the male studio execs have spent so much time patting themselves on the back, they forgot to make sure the film was any good. <br/><br/>The special effects are awful. For a huge film you would expect it to have great effects. There are huge holes in the plot and logic. <br/><br/>I went into this with an open mind but found the film dull and self indulgent. <br/><br/>There are plenty of films that empower women and have strong female leads.

Instead of making token films they should spend the money encouraging an industry where films are taken on their merit not whether they tick a box."

","Dc is a good storyteller. It knows how and where to start and where to end. The connection between series are excellent as well by just put to words in an email:Bruce Wayne. Although Wonder woman has many advantages,it is dependent to its pretty first rule actress Diana who plays her role as better as she can and this recumbency on an actress is one of the remarkable disadvantages of this movie. It may occur this is a movie produce for an actress to play a role not an actress had contracted to play in a movie."
"gigitville","8","1","2","26 February 2018"," Best DC Movie, However Much That Says
","So, DC hasn't had a great track record for their cinematic universe so far. Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Suicide Squad haven't exactly been great, or anywhere close, so I had reservations about Wonder Woman. I was excited to finally see a female protagonist in a superhero movie, but overall, I was worried. However, I actually enjoyed it. It was entertaining, the relationship between Diana and Steve was convincing and pretty well developed, and the action was so awesome I could watch Wonder Woman kick guys' asses all day. And Diana actually had some depth, being a young princess who wants to prove herself and doesn't take war as seriously at first but comes to see how serious and devastating it is. Though they could've highlighted a bit more on the first part though to add even more depth to her character. I also love all the badass female characters that were actually strong characters; you had Diana who was physically badass as well as kind hearted, then you had her mother who was a fierce ass leader, and even the Germans' main ""weapon"" was a female super smart chemist. The movie was even directed by a woman. I love all the feminism. 
Okay, so the flaws. I think the beginning should've went right into her backstory instead of showing her in the present then going back to her past. I think they should've shortened the beginning part a bit with Wayne Enterprises dropping off that picture at the end, and still have her read that note about her telling her story someday. I also didn't really like that she was ""the chosen one"" essentially, just because it's a played out trope, but you can't change her comic backstory so. Anyway, I also wish we got to know more about Steve Trevor and his past, but his character wasn't flat and he had good chemistry with Diana. Like I said, their relationship was well developed since she saved his life, so he saved hers, then they had a curiosity towards each other and a start of a relationship then went from there, as it should go. Anyway, I also didn't like how the rouse villain was chemically doping up, for no reason? I guess it was so his fight with Diana would seem fair, but he could've just been using chemical weapons against her. It didn't end up mattering anyway, and it seemed forced and out of place. If they maybe developed it a bit better, maybe having him dying from an illness or something and needing it to stay alive, that's why he sought out the chemist in the first place or something like that. And some of the slow-mo dramatic shots, because there were a lot, were a bit much. 
But overall, very good movie. Good story, good superhero movie, and it had a well written female protagonist."
"tedd0093","6","1","2","19 February 2018"," Great Superhero movie in an era of cheesy garbage
","With the new era of superhero movies, turning away from the Grimm Burton-style batman, the genre is slowly diving into a comedy-heavy CGI mess... But this movie really stands out in the first 2 acts, as the action is alternative and fresh and the effects dialed down to a minimum. This could sound like a critique but is actually a compliment. See a lot of superhero movies tend to throw as many special effects on the screen as possible, which not only confuses the viewer at some points but also covers the fact that the script is poorly written, and therefore a need for CGI distractions.Wonder Woman stars off with the clichÃ© start of a hero-story, but goes deeper than just hero vs. antagonist. It shows the fear and strategy of war and really moves on the setting of the timeline. The actors are charming and really knock it out of the park when it comes to convincing the audience of their empathy. The biggest critique I have, is based on the final act of the film, which shy away from the deeper and more meaningful narrative. The ending leaves us with a very CGI-heavy and over the top dragonball-style-fight. This is the worst part of the movie - even though it's well made - it's still a complete shift in tone so that the tempo build up from the rest of the film, is completely ruined. It also ruins the first good antagonist from DC in a while (last one was Bane from the dark knight trilogy), from being a totalitarian war tyran - to being a literal God-of-War.... And the medieval skyrim-style armor doesn't really make it any better. Overall! the music and effects are great! actors performing really well! and the war narrative fits good until the end. The final act is boggus, and the antagonist turns to garbage. Really a shame that this could have been way better, but still a good movie."
"Richie-67-485852","7","1","2","12 February 2018"," I Wonder
","I like Wonder Woman because I grew up reading the comics and she could do no wrong plus pull her weight and it wasn't about her being a woman as much as just using her gifts, talents and abilities to do good and help others. This version tries to give it a feminist identity by emphasizing the female part instead of appreciating it. I also thought that the origin and development of her birth and rise would have been more dynamic and have more detail to it. This movie serves as a start-up for the subject but could have been so much more. I also didn't care for the supporting actors and their parts which were not plausible. I am willing to bend on Super-hero flicks to a point but not break. This one took its time getting started and by mid-way through the movie we are so glad to see some real good focused Wonder Woman action. The story lacks as does the final battle but whatever one thinks this ends up being the movie it is. Yes to watching it so you keep up. If those who story-tell would just put their hearts into it...."
"niallmaggs","10","1","2","5 January 2018"," Finally a great DCEU film! - Film Review By Niall Maggs (http://ateenstakeonfilm.com)
","'Wonder Woman' is the 4th film in the DCEU so far and most definitely the best by a long shot. As an avid fan of the DC universe, the DCEU, for the most part, was good, but I was slightly disappointed. 'Man of Steel' was the best before this one, but 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice's' muddled plot, made even comic book fans confused, and the disappointment of last year's 'Suicide Squad' was a let down. So thankfully Patty Jenkins came along to save the DCEU, by directing one of the best superhero films I've ever seen and my new favourite film of 2017!<br/><br/>I think the main reason I loved 'Wonder Woman' was because,*cough* Gal Gadot *cough*, I loved the World War 1 setting. Watching her beat enemies up in the trenches and no man's land was entertaining and brilliantly filmed!
Chris Pine's character brought comedy and lightened the tone, which is not DC's way, but it was nice to see a change. This made watching the film a fun and enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>The use of special effects as well was brilliantly done. The use of slow motion during fight scenes was mind blowing and made Wonder Woman even cooler then she already was!<br/><br/>What 'Wonder Woman' did right was creating the best origin story for a superhero we've ever seen. It explores Diana Prince's past when she was a child, and learning to fight and battle with the 'Amazon's' to defeat 'Ares'. Speaking of 'Ares', I was extremely pleased to see one of the best DC villains for the first time in a live action DC film! He was played brilliantly by David Thewlis, in a creepy and sinister performance.<br/><br/>Overall, Wonder Woman was good, but felt like the same superhero films we've been seeing for years."
"jenniblove","7","1","2","3 January 2018"," Just one beef
","It was good and I love that a woman was in such a powerful role. She was great in this movie. I just have one beef...<br/><br/>Why would it center on the big gas weapon that could kill ""thousands"" and leave out the nuclear weapon that killed MILLIONS? Especially when that nuclear weapon was dropped just to get a jump on communist economic influence. It would be wonderful to see a world war II movie that shows more nuance than the good guy bad guy narrative that's always told in America. I think we're all ready to be presented with complexity. Especially when we export our media around the world, it does not do well to romantisize history that paints a complex event in such simple light of ""good guys"" vs ""bad guys"" (actual words used in movie to refer to Americans and Germans.)"
"gavinp9","8","1","2","2 January 2018"," Great origin story and fun to watch
","'Wonder Woman' is the first good DC film of their attempt to create an extended universe to rival Marvel. It certainly has a livelier and less somber tone than 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman Vs Superman', and works better as an introduction to the character than either of those films. Most of this is down to Gadot, who plays Diana with innocence, as well as integrity and passion. Also, doesn't hurt that she's extremely beautiful. The film does a good job of introducing the Amazons and how their island-home, Themyscira, is hidden from the world.<br/><br/>Diana's mum, Queen Hippolyta (Nielsen) has kept her sheltered for her whole life (not certain if the Amazons are immortal, or not...), but this changes when World War I finds them, via Captain Trevor (Pine). Then, Diana's off to the real world to help mankind in their battle against Ares, God of War (a substitute for the Central Powers in WWI). There's plenty of funny moments as Diana is introduced to London in the early 20th century and especially with Trevor, since she's never met a male before. We quickly meet Trevor's rag-tag team and suddenly we're off to Belgium where the action begins and we get to see Wonder Woman in full flight/fight.<br/><br/>Ludendorff (Huston) is good as the evil German general, but there's a few similarities with 'Captain America: The First Avenger', as he is basically a ""Red Skull""-substitute, has an offsider who develops weapons of mass destruction, gets super-strength, and then has to fight someone super-strong wearing red and blue. The main difference is that Wonder Woman' is set WWI, but both comic book characters were created in 1941 during WWII. Still, it doesn't really detract for the film, with plenty of great hand-to-hand combat, as well as full-on war scenes. Pretty satisfying conclusion, with Diana's purpose, humour, powers and morals all being set-up nicely for 'Justice League', but works well as a standalone film."

I loved the opening sequences, the ""no man's land"" scene where she goes against him and climbs up and defends against the bullets,and the ""fish out of water"" scenes where Pine's character is on the island and where Wonder Woman first visits London. By the way, did anyone ever notice that the words ""Wonder Woman"" were never spoken in the film?

"darkguardian-99861","8","1","2","21 December 2017"," Best DCEU movie until now (December 2017)
","I saw this movie relatively recently. I have heard many good words from both reviews and crowd, but I was distrustful due to my general disappointment from Suicide Squad and BatmanVSuperman, but I decided to see it to have an opinion of myself and frankly, all the good words do the movie justice.
It takes place in World War I and has a simple premise. However, the dialogue is nice, all the actors are doing pretty well depicting their characters, the action is astonishing and the visuals are beyond magnificent.
The main critisism that exists is that the final part of the movie suffers and that the villain is too obvious. While, I can agree that the final part becomes a bit DBZ-like, the villain within the movie isn't that obvious. I had known about him, but he acts like nothing a villain, until his reveal, making it feel a bit forced.
To conclude, my final opinion is that this is a movie worth seeing and whatever issues one may have are more nitpicking than actual isses. I do recommend it as a nice Superhero movie and the best recent DC live-action movie to date."
"dwgmartin-33760","8","1","2","19 December 2017"," Colour in a DC movie!
","Wonder Woman: the first female led Superhero hero movie in this new era of superheroes and the first actually really good DC movie since the Dark Knight. <br/><br/>I am so glad I can say this is good, because it could very easily failed horribly but thanks to the confidence of the director (Patty Jenkins) and the performance of Gal Gadot, which is very similar to Christopher Reeves in the original Superman, make this a superb movie. <br/><br/>And unlike other DC movies there's COLOUR, by God there is colour in this movie and its glorious- Themyscira looks almost mythical in appearance. They also don't shy away from the horror of war, not going full blown war movie but enough to feel the real. 
The acting is also on point with a lot of subtle actions which just adds to the performances, and the film has a lot of slow moments to build up the characters, it's not all action. <br/><br/>But where WW falls is the ending, it's like every other DC movie a mass of CGI at night which is really disappointing as it was great up to then and saying that there's still good stuff happening but would be great if I can see the entirety of it. The other issue is the villian like all other Superhero movies are unremarkable- Aries would be better as a concept rather than an actual thing. <br/><br/>Nonetheless Wonder Women is a fantastic movie which display a strong female character that transcends gender and is simply a strong likeable character. And unlike Ghostbusters 2016, WW doesn't treat men as idiots or arseholes- this is a movie for both men and women and is an enjoyable out-of-world story with some fantastic action sequences told with a great sense of earnest. <br/><br/>I give Wonder Women a B+"
"McFrogg","9","4","18","9 November 2017"," Finally, a good DC movie.
","I always hate action movies where the main character is a woman. ""Look, people! She's tough as nails! She said the F- word! She doesn't give a damn! She's like a guy without a wiener!"". Heck, I don't even care that much about Wonder Woman either. Maybe it's because my older brother forced me to be Wonder Woman when we played Superfriends as kids? Who knows. She's just never been on any of my Top Ten favorite superheroes list...<br/><br/>...which is why I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the Wonder Woman movie. This is what Man of Steel should have been...It's (for the most part) lighthearted and optimistic, and the main character is so good and sweet, like Christopher Reeve's Superman. This is probably one of the best superhero movies since Spider-Man 2. <br/><br/>How refreshing to see a female hero in an action movie who retains her femininity when most female ""heroes"" act like (insert that word for female dogs). There's none of the politically correct, childish ""girls rule, boys drool"" garbage that plague modern movies here, just a fun, entertaining comic book movie with likable main characters.<br/><br/>I also think it's cool how this movie unintentionally debunks Neil DeGrasse Tyson's nihilistic propaganda from BvS. In Wonder Woman, people are made in the image of a god (not THE God, but WW is just a fantasy movie anyway). We now have two comic book movies that kick DeGrasse's grass, the other one being Doctor Strange.<br/><br/>The only problem I had with it was some of the language and unnecessary sexual content. But it's pretty mild compared to most of the slime that runs out Hollywood these days. <br/><br/>Hopefully, Wonder Woman 2 will be even better. <br/><br/>Trivia: According to some comic book historians, the creepy guy who created Wonder Woman based his character on Margaret Sanger. But if that's true, why didn't Wonder Woman kill the baby in London?"

And the Amazons were as convincing as a bunch of Victoria Secret's models trying to beat bare handedly a team of elite SEALS. And they even tried to speak with a lower voice, which was ridiculous.<br/><br/>The main actress is stiff, with no charisma, C. Pine and the guys playing Germans were way better than her.

","The film is a pretty fun origin story for a super hero. I don't know much about the Wonder Woman comics but other than the origin story within a flashback thing the film never really gets bogged down with excessive nerdy details. Enough of the world was explained to be understandable with enough of the world being unexplained to be engaging. It struck a nice balance of telling a single story while opening up the universe to be explored. The only major down side is the silly comic book villain that shows up in the 3rd act. Add in that Thewlis is horribly miscast as that character and really the film nearly comes off the rails by the end. I suspect Jenkins lost a few fights in the 3rd act.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, however, that problem amounts to very little. Jenkins fills the film with a lot of lyrical images. Unlike Snyder she realizes that beauty is derived from meaning and doesn't just create empty spectacle. Her direction coupled with the period aspects of the story provide a refreshing change of light optimism for the DCCU that is usually so needlessly dour.<br/><br/>This film was a surprise.

","General Conclusion: This is not a bad film but it certainly has its problems. Definitely a step up for DCEU movies.<br/><br/>Pro's:<br/><br/>-Gal Gadot in general is awesome, a great and strong female lead -Her chemistry with Chris Pine is undeniable. -The action scenes and choreography are incredible (especially the end fight) -Beautifully shot/directed -Robin Wright was awesome in what little screen time she got.<br/><br/>Con's:<br/><br/>-Terrible setting. WW1 is dreary, gray, and boring. -Abuses the ""foreigner that doesn't understand social norms"" trope/clichÃ© -Humor almost always doesn't land. -Weak primary villain -Character-ruining casting for the true, hidden villain. Couldn't take them seriously. -Twist reveal of actual villain is ridiculously unnecessary and forced. -Diana and Trevor's relationship should have remained platonic. The romantic tie was stupid for such a strong female lead. There was no need for her to have a love interest. -Dialogue was definitely better than past DCEU movies, but was subpar."

","I had high hopes for this remake, but like most remakes it did not live up to the previous wonder woman. I grew up watching the old Wonder Woman, and know the story line fairly well, in this they killed off Steve Trevor in the first episode, played it off that she was the sister of Aries, etc...the story line was terrible, and even worse than the story line was the ""Super Hero"" stuff she did, she was never able to do the things she did in this movie that she did in the original, and the computer generated graphics and stunts was just horrible, save your money and wait for them to make a remake of this remake, it is one of the worse shows I've seen this year.

","There might be a spoiler here I give ten out of ten to anything that ""holds together"" meaning ""has integrity"". This movie had something to say and said it. Wonder Woman was the creation of Professor Marston, a feminist. There is a whole book about it, him and his creation.<br/><br/>World War I (The Great War, The War to End All Wars, what irony) was only the first act of a twenty-year truce. The Treaty of Versailles and related treaties set up all the problems that we face now. Think of France and Great Britain dividing up the Middle East with no regard to ethnic and religious interpretation boundaries. Bad choices were made. And choice is a matter of love, which is what Wonder Woman is about, which is neither male nor female. That and kick-ass fighting skills. Both require being attentive. Humans are flawed but are known by their choices. In Existentialist terms, ""Man is known by his projects."" Think of the Flood. Mankind had become so bad that the gods (the Flood story comes from the Gilgamesh and is in Genesis) wanted to destroy it. But He, They, won't do it again. According to Jared Diamond, societies ""choose"" to fail or succeed. Some people choose to blame God, Allah, the gods, the devil, whatever. Events overwhelm them rather than what they think of events. This movie has that philosophical vibe without losing the tension. <br/><br/>That's enough. Well done. WWI has always held a fascination for me. My Irish immigrant uncles left Great Britain only to end end up fighting to save them from their bad choices."
"sternlicht","10","3","12","5 June 2017"," I'm an anti-feminist and I liked Wonder Woman. Here's why.
","I've been anticipating this movie since before I knew it was going to get made, long before Gal Gadot premiered her vision of the character in ""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Stop Letting Zack Snyder Ruin Superman"". I wanted Wonder Woman come to life on screen, not to inspire a generation of young women or somesuch, but because I like Wondy in comic books, and hoped to see her done justice.<br/><br/>Knowing how much social expectation was going to be attached to this film, I went in with my guard up, hoping that I was going to get my entertainment dollar's worth. And I have to say I did. While not the best superhero movie we've had, this work is very enjoyable. (I figured some 10% would be pandering to feminists, but the only ""SJW moment"" that I had while watching, besides Etta Candy, was a single exchange with a Muslim who speaks of wishing to be an actor, ""but I'm the wrong color; we all have our battles"".) The opening sequence is about what you'd expect, necessary humdrum exposition but hardly boring. In only slightly too long, we watch a little girl turn into a teenager and then Gal Gadot, who plays Wondy every bit as well as we pretty much knew she would, after her excellent appearance in BVS:DOJ. The film's inciting incident is more than a little contrived, but gets us out of this necessarily dull opening without too much trouble.<br/><br/>The first big battle scene showcases what is probably my biggest criticism about this mostly-good film - way, way too much slow-mo in the action sequences. Doing it this way gives us a good look at the stunts, but really breaks your suspension of belief during what should be a lightning-fast, pulse-pounding melee. This problem recurs again in the mid-movie battle scene, where Wondy takes out an entire village full of soldiers pretty much by herself; here it's more understandable that they'd want to slow down the action so that we can tell just what she's doing, but in this first fight, we're not even watching the main character for the most part, so it's all the more jarring. The battle's still cool, but feels artificial and unconvincing, on top of the other problems this early scene had.<br/><br/>Doctor Poison, IMO, steals the show despite how small her part is. I found her portrayal the single most interesting thing about the whole movie; she's extremely different from the usual comic-book bad guy, and rightly makes absolutely no attempt to fight Wondy, who would flatten her in an instant. Instead, we mostly only see her in the lab with her boss, and once exchanging dialogue with Chris Pine while he's undercover for some reason (this scene's existence doesn't really make sense in the plot, but it's still enjoyable, apart from the fact that Diana is clearly walking around with a sword on her back and nobody notices). Poison's makes a good illustration of the archetypal ""evil scientist"", but plays this role in a very understated way, rather than as some cackling maniac. Like Gadot herself in ""BVS"", Poison's role here is small, but extremely memorable.<br/><br/>The first great scene in the film comes when Diana breaks into the Amazons' treasure vault; we get a look at how insanely strong she is, when she smashes hand-holds into stone with her fingers! Once decked out in patriotic armor, she collects Chris Pine and the two of them head off. They chat on their boat about what Wondy does and does not know about men; though Pine's awkwardness isn't entirely convincing, the exchange does bring up some obvious questions (thankfully she handles the subject with tasteful aplomb, showing no defensiveness whatsoever).<br/><br/>Pine's behavior continues to be charmingly nonsensical; Diana wants to barge toward the action, but he manages to convince her to go along with his agenda of getting her a lower profile. We meet Etta Candy, this film's nod to the feminist audience; the plump suffragette takes an instant shine to Diana, but can't resist a couple of verbal swipes at someone more ""privileged"". Etta and Poison are the only actual women in the film (the Amazons, created separately by Zeus, are explicitly not human). But Etta's on screen time was brief enough not to bother me.<br/><br/>Diana refuses to be led around by Steve anymore; she single-handedly breaks a stalemate in the trenches by charging into fire. This scene retroactivates a plot hole in BVS (as if that film needed more problems), but is the most thrilling we've seen so far, even with too much slowmo. I do think that it would have been improved by having her suffer at least one minor setback during the sequence, maybe getting one bullet through the leg which slows her down a little. As is, she does suffer from just a little Boring Invincible Hero. Later there's some shaky dialogue between Diana and Chris Pine, which fails to sound profound; she later calls back two of these lines as if they had actually been cool.<br/><br/>Having seen most superhero movies, I'd rank ""Wonder Woman"" slightly behind the best, such as ""Doctor Strange"" and the original ""Iron Man"", probably about on par with ""The Avengers"" and better than ""Thor"". Far and away the best DC movie since ""Batman Begins"" or maybe ""The Dark Knight"". I'll be looking forward to seeing them bring her back.<br/><br/>We all know trailers are often false advertising, or (like BVS:DOJ) they show everything good in the entire movie. ""Wonder Woman"" avoids both of these traps; if you've seen the trailer, you know what you'll be getting in the movie, but there will still be surprises.<br/><br/>The 3D conversion of this movie is competent and not too distracting, but hardly the best I've ever seen in a theater. But a trailer for ""Thor: Ragnarok"" made SUPERB use of 3D, on par with ""Avatar"" and ""Pacific Rim""."
"vikitou","10","4","19","7 March 2020"," Far too meaningful but the seeing are blind
","This movie isn't for constricted close-minded fools.<br/><br/>I am not an experienced critic. Despite this, I am just a human and this movie reminded me of that.<br/><br/>The Amazonians' Island is beyond beautiful. Ethereal. It is magical and colorful - and Peaceful. The Amazonians represent women in the past and how they fought to not be treated as meaningless walking wombs without minds and opinions . The fought. They brought love and peace. They represent where women are today and the fact that there are better days for us to come.<br/><br/>The human world outside of the barrier-gray, ugly, hopeless. The result of endless hate and greed-Our world. Even to this day. In "" the Human world"", there were only blacks, grays, greens and brown-reds. A subtle terrifying representation of our biggest downfalls-wars. Death at the hands of brother, a child, a random person dreaming of living a sweet and colorful life. Blood soaking the earth. Tears spilled. Desperate pleads to one day see our loved ones who left to fight.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman represents our desire to learn, love, protect. Ares represents the hate and greed that have completely blackened the humans' hearts. A fight for who we want to be, who we choose to be.<br/><br/>There may have been some misses in the movie like how the Amazonian sacrificed herself to save Diana despite knowing she is Goddess who can only die at the hands of another God. However, I do not only watch a movie to find faults in it. I definitely enjoyed the fight scenes, the characters' development, the magnificent views. I tend to stare far too deeply into everything and this movie did not disappoint. It reminded me again of how much more there is to humans other than only negative things, how we are the ones who choose if we want to nurture the light or the darkness in our souls."

","I was quite disappointed when I learnt that they hadn't cast Alexandra Daddario as Wonder Woman, but I'm over that now (not really, but I am slowly coming to terms with it). In lieu of Daddario, I guess Gal Gadot isn't a terrible alternative, but I doubt that the film would have been great whoever played the title role: the story, by Zack Snyder, is a by-the-numbers exercise in superhero banality, while director Patty Jenkins goes for CGI-laden style over substance, her film reliant on flashy overblown set-pieces in which our heroine proves totally impervious to harm, whether it be poison gas attack or being hit broadside by a flying tank. With Wonder Woman able to withstand any onslaught, the film is totally lacking in excitement.<br/><br/>Having watched a handful of other DCU movies, including the recent over-rated effort that was Shazam!, I'm still waiting to be impressed. Casting David Thewlis as the villain definitely isn't the way to go...<br/><br/>4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb - Mindless generic popcorn superhero nonsense.

"nkitani","5","2","7","1 May 2018"," Doomed To Mediocrity By Star ""Actress""
","Considering the copy-and-paste job Hollywood has done with many of the comicbook movies of late, I fully expected this to be another piece of glossy garbage.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised. While it should by no means be taken seriously, the Wonder Woman movie provides some solid entertainment. It has some nice cinematic visuals, thrilling battles, a few laughs, and a moment or two of true emotion. Chris Pine plays a fantastic role - arguably the best of the film. The supporting characters are likeable and well-portrayed. I was particularly impressed with the writer's use of little-known biblical parallel. Despite several tongue-in-cheek moments and minor ""fail""s, I quite enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>However, a movie is only as good as its star, since even a great character can fail to convince viewers if his/her actor lacks talent. Gadot was a very, very poor choice for the role of Wonder Woman. Firstly, she is not an actress, but is actually a beauty pageant contestant. Secondly, her ethnicity, eye colour, build, and general appearance differ too greatly from the comicbook character she was chosen to portray. Thirdly - and most importantly - she has absolutely no acting ability. Her repertoire consists of two basic facial expressions and the movements of a fashion model. In the role of a warrior, she is laughably lacking in stature, physical strength, agility, and fluidity of motion. In the role of /any/ character with a heart, she is painfully devoid of emotion. She was chosen for her pageant looks and nothing more, and that fact is clear throughout the film.<br/><br/>Had a different ""actress"" been chosen for the starring role, Wonder Woman could have stood alongside the Avengers, Batman, and X-Men movies. Unfortunately, we're stuck with Gadot, and so any future Wonder Woman flicks are doomed to mediocrity."

"davidwoo-14482","4","2","7","27 March 2018"," Production was rushed.
","First let me just say that I love Gal Gadot for who she is. I believe she has great potential and will exceed far past people's expectations. <br/><br/>However if I were to be frank, Gal Gadot did not fit the role of Wonder Women. And I'd like to think that this was not her fault but the fault of the script writers and perhaps even the cast directors. Granted Patty Jenkins, the director, initially was not sure about Gal Gadot's casting as Wonder Woman but she eventually gave in and acclaimed her for her work....I'm not sure if I can say the same. If the script writers gave her less dialogue and more motion acting, would've portrayed Wonder Woman as an even more powerful and respected woman. Think about it, a woman who knows that she is powerful does not need to talk much, the people around her treats her as such. <br/><br/>ROBIN WRIGHT should have been Wonder Woman and I say this because she portrayed all the characteristics of what we all thought Wonder Woman would be like. Her attitude, her attributes, the way how her mental toughness and aggressiveness plays into her character all tied with empowering women probably more than Gal Gadot (just being frank, i still love Gal Galdot).<br/><br/>I have a pretty good feeling that DC was trying to play catch-up in producing good films against Marvel. This is probably where they really messed up. After DC got wind of the Justice League movie they decided to rush these films (which had such great potential) and ultimately produced a very poor story line with awkward script writing resulting in a confusing, non-impactful film. More money was spent on CGI than the actual build of the story line and I am so taken aback by how little was done for the story of Wonder Woman. Either Snyder was high, was preoccupied with something else or he was just having a bad year. <br/><br/>WONDER WOMAN is too goddamn powerful/enemies don't know how to shoot her at the legs/poison gas is weak sauce. <br/><br/>I mean think about this for a second, when Christopher Nolan created the Batman series we all expected him to follow corny CGI action scenes, follow the footsteps of previous Batman films, similar script writing as previous films, etc. But he blew us out of the water by creating a film that took on a WHOLE NEW perspective of Bruce Wayne's life. The movie was so artistic not just through the sequence of actions scenes but more so the plot of the story. It encapsulated the audience by allowing the main character to be more human than hero so that we'd be able to see ourselves in him (Bruce Wayne). Which is why in the end we end up rooting for Bruce Wayne after the turmoil he had to endure and all the training he had to go through. Nolan took it upon himself to create a serious movie, his goal was to create a Batman film that everyone would respect and take seriously. <br/><br/>Now I'm not saying that everyone is a Nolan, but I am saying that if the industry were to take into consideration of what Nolan did or took the time to produce a more enriched story line Wonder Woman would be a far greater film. The movie had such great potential and it's sad to see such a film follow the cliche standards of what a hero movie is supposed to be like on top of the really bad dialogues/story line. Again my assumption is that they rushed this film to be produced against Marvel movies which is why this film was less artistic and more like it was trying to copy a kids cartoon version of Wonder Woman. <br/><br/>How I would've cast the members:
Wonder Woman - ROBIN WRIGHT, Angelina Jolie or Zoe Saldana
Steve Trevor - Tom Hardy or Joel Edgerton
Ludendorff - Tom Hiddleston or Hugo Weaving or Rufus Sewell<br/><br/>Writers: Bob Kane, David S. Goyer, Gavin O'Connor, Anthony Tambakis, Kurt Johnstad, Jane Goldman, Matthew Vaughn"

In the distant past, Ares, the god of war, slew all his fellow gods, but his father, Zeus, struck him down. Before succumbing to his injuries, Zeus left the Amazons a weapon capable of killing his renegade son: the ""Godkiller"", presented as a ceremonial sword. Queen Hippolyta, Diana's mother, believes that Ares will never return and forbids Diana from training as a warrior, but Diana and her aunt General Antiope defy the queen and begin training in secret. When the two are discovered by Hippolyta, Antiope convinces her sister to allow Diana's training.<br/><br/>As a young woman in 1918, Diana rescues American pilot Captain Steve Trevor after his plane crashes off Themyscira's coast. The island is soon invaded by the landing party of a German cruiser pursuing Steve. The Amazons engage and kill all of the German sailors, but Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana by intercepting a bullet meant for her. Interrogated with the Lasso of Hestia, Steve reveals that ""The War to End All Wars"" is raging in the outside world, and that he is an Allied spy.

Believing Ares is responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the sword and leaves Themyscira with Steve to find and destroy Ares.<br/><br/>Diana translates Maru's notes and reveals that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the warfront. Although forbidden by his commanders to act, Steve, with secret funding from Sir Patrick, recruits spy Sameer, marksman Charlie, and smuggler Chief to help prevent the gas from being released. When the team reaches the Western Front in Belgium, they are halted by the enemy lines, but Diana pushes alone through no man's land and rallies the Allied forces behind her to liberate the village of Veld. The team briefly celebrates and takes the group photograph from the beginning of the film. That night, Diana and Steve become intimate and share a kiss.<br/><br/>The team learns a gala will be held at the nearby German High Command. Steve and Diana each infiltrate the party, he intending to locate the gas and destroy it, she intending to kill Ludendorff, believing he is Ares and that killing him will end the war. Steve stops her to avoid destroy his plan. Ludendorff unleashes the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Diana blames Steve for intervening and pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills Ludendorff but is confused when his death does not stop the war.<br/><br/>Sir Patrick appears, revealing himself as Ares and tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans The evil ideas and evil inspirations which is ultimately their decision to cause violence as they are inherently corrupt. He destroys the ceremonial sword, revealing Diana is the true ""Godkiller"" as she is Zeus' daughter, then tries to persuade her to help him destroy humankind to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battles and the rest of Steve's team destroy Maru's laboratory, Steve pilots the bomber carrying the gas to a safe altitude and detonates it, sacrificing himself in the process. Ares attempts to harness Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but her memories of Steve cause her to decide that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and kills Ares.<br/><br/>Later in Trafalgar Square, the team celebrates the end of the war."

","A question has been raised millions of times through Marvel series--- -a peculiarly fascinating question which the question itself turns to be the answer. I have seen this self-answering question haunts in Thor's struggling confliction towards his brother Loki, a marital quarrel that Tony Starks snared with Pepper Potts, or even in that looming cavern that Bruce Wayne dwells in. The question is extremely elementary as well as phantasmally incomprehensible----who is and not a hero?<br/><br/>This ancient puzzle has mazed human-beings since the very beginning of civilization, however, marvel series has bestowed that self- examination muse a fresh meaning, or to say a new bottle to hold new wine. From millennium battle between Amazon Diana and Ares the incarnation of war and chaos to Peter Benjamin Parker's vigilantism practice on Dr. Octopus, it seems that our heroes with incredibly powerful talents are eventually no more than any other human. The apparent weakness, almost each individual has severely suffered from, like thorn in their flesh, is where their power generates, the flaw in their characters, sometimes a considerably imperfection, has ironically inspired our protagonists to venture deeper into the valley of death, combating their archenemies dauntlessly. Yet sometimes after justice has been done, they too, like other common folks, facing unfounded accusations and vile slanders from the very people they saved.<br/><br/>Isn't it true that heroes do not exist, that no one is strong enough to redeem himself let alone the whole world. Isn't it also true that in fact every human being is capable of self-exaltation to a case of hero, to stand out, fight for what freedom and love demands.<br/><br/>Corinthians 12:10 That is why, for Christ sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships. In persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong."

"Special-K88","Null","2","7","5 June 2017"," a wonder to behold
","The first solo live-action Wonder Woman film is brought to the screen in impressive fashion by director Patty Jenkins. A prequel of sorts, the film chronicles young Amazonian warrior Diana Prince who trains for the impending return of Ares, the God of War. A chance encounter with American military pilot Steve Trevor leads her to believe that she can locate the unscrupulous Ares herself, so she leaves her homeland and finds herself in WWI era London still determined to complete her mission. Unlike previous DCEU films, this managers to tell a compelling—and coherent—story with splendid visual effects, a vivid sense of time and place, just the right blend of action, drama, and humor, along with believable (and engaging) characters. Follows an origin tale formula yet still feels fresh and exciting, and Gadot is magnificent in the central role; a definite step in the right direction for the expanding universe. ***"
"rockman182","8","2","7","4 June 2017"," Wonder Woman (2017)
","While the DC Extended Universe has been much maligned (quite understandably), Wonder Woman seemed to be the great hope in the universe. I didn't hate Batman v. Superman as much as everyone else seemed to hate it, but the film was very flawed and could have been way better. For me, the best part of that film was the introduction of Wonder Woman to the film world. People wanted to criticize Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman before they even got to see her. I've heard it all from ""she's a no name actress"" to ""she's not busty enough for the role."" Having now seen Wonder Woman I think those arguments has to be put to rest as she brings the character to life and completely embodies Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>The film is an origin story of Wonder Woman. We first find out how Diana of Themyscira came to be. We learn of the land of Amazons and how one day a pilot crashing into the island (played by Chris Pine) would change her life forever. She leaves with him, in a backdrop of European World War I, to London in order to find Ares (God of War) to end the war and the evilness of man. While her mission may sound ludicrous, it turns out she's not far off from the truth in what she seeks. Along the way she comes to grips with her power, her love for Steve Trevor, and what she must to do to stop the war and end suffering.<br/><br/>I'm quite a fan of Wonder Woman. I don't always read up on comics but I've followed what I can WW wise. I watch the show with Lynda Carter on a weekly basis and have tried watching as many animated DC films with Wonder Woman as a can. I was pleased with this addition to the universe of Wonder Woman. Its the first good DC universe film (since it started with man of Steel). You won't see dark, somber tones and colors here. This film is pretty vibrant and light hearted when it can be. The period set design is excellent for a comic book film, sort of reminiscent of Captain America: The First Avenger.<br/><br/>The cinematography is excellent especially at the beginning. Seeing the beautiful world of Themyscira is a joy to behold. It pops right onto the scene. For the most part the action scenes are filmed very well. I can't think of too many issues. My main gripe was the villain of the film feeling like it was shoe-horned in just to make everything more convenient. The film is quite long so the middle passage has to do a lot with getting introduced to the team that Trevor has assembled. I also think I missed how her hero costume came to be? There also isn't enough exposition and exploration into Doctor Poison or General Ludendorff; the film could have definitely benefited from more of that.<br/><br/>I thought there was good chemistry between the two leads which makes the silly and humorous moments between them work. It's spectacular to watch Wonder Woman in action. Gadot looks great kicking butt and she completely absorbs the screen and your mind with every bullet she deflects and every giant leap she takes. The film isn't without flaws but its definitely the first good to great DC Universe film. We finally get to see Wonder Woman in full glory and power on the big screen. If you've been toiling through BVS and Suicide Squad in disappointment, I think you will really like this. Its a great entry by Patty Jenkins who should really helm the sequel.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","First off this movie sucked. Whew, OK now lets go in chronological order to all the suckage.<br/><br/>Young WW: We see WW as a child, all she wants to do is fight bla bla bla. What I saw more than a horrible child actor was the fact that just about ALL the women appeared to have no less than 10 plastic surgery procedures done on them. Now, these are supposedly 'ancient times'. Even in the modern world at the time they did not have the capabilities of face lifts/nose jobs/cheek&chin implants, lips injections, and boob jobs. Among other things.<br/><br/>What powerful women they are that they are so insecure that they have to cut themselves open. Also why does no one age? But well they are apparently made of magic...or something. Reminds me of the sexism of a michael bay movie, no old women, no fat women, no ugly women, no little kids exist. Only hot model type women exist. Tall, big boobs, high cheekbones, etc.<br/><br/>So, according to this movie, women are valid, strong, equal....as long as they are young beautiful models. Umm...Fake feminism. Women should be equal since women are human beings. Being sexually desirable should NOT define women. WW is hot therefore according to this movie's logic she is powerful, wonderful, great, etc...*sigh*<br/><br/>Next, when she finally comes of age, the first thing that happens is that she meets a guy. OK now I gotta compare this movie to Twilight. And you know you are in some deep do-do if your movie is put in the same breath as Twilight. Well here goes sadly, both were directed by women, starring women, and supposedly empower women. LOL But WW's WHOLE life, just like Bella in Twilight, revolves around men. Aries, and her love interest. Just like Bella was all about Edward, not her own well being, not her family, not her education, not her future, but A MAN. When are we going to have a movie where a woman is not chasing after a man?<br/><br/>So then we have Chris Pine doing some subtle sexism as he does in all his films, undermining women. Even though this woman FREAKING jumped into the air and broke a whole bell tower. He SEES that she has magical powers YET he STILL can't suspended his disbelief in the fact that yet ANOTHER magical creature can exist!? Aries? Really? And THIS light misogynist is the man she falls for. And bases her WHOLE life on. ""Love is the answer."" Yeah he truly loved her, by undermining her the WHOLE time...and oh yeah she literally was a GOD. LMAO"

That flick was also way too long and did had a rare story.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Wonder Woman when the story was told were she grew up. Guess it took the first 20 minutes but suddenly a man comes ashore and he's the first man they ever saw but not only that and from there it's downhill, he brings war with him. <br/><br/>So off goes Wonder Woman to help the soldier in WWI.

For comparison - a masterpiece like Apocalypse Now is rated 8.4 by IMDb staff. King Arthur and Wonder Woman are not even on the same planet as the dark vision of Mr. Coppola.<br/><br/>For me IMDb loses it's creditability rapidly. Wonder Woman like King Arthur - mediocre movies at best. A rating of 8 or higher!? Ridiculous.<br/><br/>Some reviewers call this the best D.C. output so far - well, if this is the best D.C. can do, the company should pull back from movie bizz and focus on publishing comics again.<br/><br/>But I will confess, if I would be still aged around 10 or 12 I maybe would like Wonder Woman more.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the main theme, the setting of a woman fighting in the trenches of WWI is just a recycled idea - Mr. Zack Snyder did this already in Sucker Punch and the execution of the fighting scene there is zillion times better done.

So, my concerns around the discrimination in Hollywood and censorship across entertainment is proved by the mere fact that my previous review got censored. Good job IMDb!

"suzanneverderber","1","3","14","17 June 2017"," Disappointing Scripts
","Contains spoilers.<br/><br/>I grew up in the 1970s and 1980s reading Wonder Woman comics. In addition to having a subscription, I had reprints of the original comics from the 1940s that I read over and over again. Wonder Woman was a role model for me, I suppose, and so, even though I don't usually go to superhero movies anymore, I decided to see this film because I had heard it had gotten good reviews. I was disappointed on the verge of disgusted with the changes made to the origin story and with the masculinist, patriarchal bent of the script. It almost seem as if the intention of the writers was to eliminate any aspect of the Wonder Woman story that verged on feminist or radical.<br/><br/>First of all, the real Diana was made out of clay by her mother, Hippolyta, and it was Aphrodite who breathed life into her. This was an amazing take on the misogynistic Pygmalion myth, in which women are depicted as capable of reproduction. Why did this film mock the real origin story of WW, and even worse, claim that she was the offspring of Ares and Hippolyta? This is one of many ways that the film twisted the story to subtly privilege masculine power. In the comic, there are many young Amazons being trained to be warriors. When Steve crash lands, he is rescued by Diana and a friend who are careful not to let his feet touch Paradise Island. This is important because Aphrodite and Athena have decreed that because men are warlike, they are not allowed to set foot on the island, and if they do, the Amazons will lose their immortality. This was eliminated in the film. I'll just make one more point (I could go on all day): the film never explained Diana's bracelets. The comics do. Before the Amazons settled on Paradise island, they were conquered and enslaved by Hercules and his men; they rose up and defeated them, but always wore their bracelets to remind them to never again allow themselves to submit to men. Again, the film ignored this uncomfortable piece of radical feminist lore. I also am baffled by the switch from WWII to WWI: Wonder Woman is specifically sent to fight the Nazis (in her invisible plane), and her costume is supposed to resemble the American flag. As another reviewer noted, making Steve an American spy fighting with the British-- is absurdly convoluted. <br/><br/>I guess overall I thought it was terrible that the film departed so much from the original story. WW is a great character because she has a great story, inspiring especially to women because it has the same radical edge of a lot of Greek mythology and tragedy. This patriarchal script subtly blunted that edge, turning the Amazons into victims and Wonder Woman into a naif who spends her time gaping at Steve's ""equipment"" in a torturous attempt at humor."

DC has been trying to play catch up with Marvel in the cinematic universe, ultimately not executing their product effectively. DC just blasted ensemble films to the audience with out building to it. Where as Marvel has been building up a backstory of a continuous villain (hydra) while at same time making a sole story for specific films. This is what DC should have done and brought this film out first, then other solo films, create a continuous back story to keep audiences engaged. This is where Wonder Woman failed. There was no real story, it was just Wonder Woman doing her thing. It was more of a spin off to a trilogy that has ended. Pacing was off too. Action scenes, though great, but came out of nowhere and stopped out of nowhere. The villain was horrible. DC is known for iconic villains and they failed here which was disappointing. In fact I'm still wondering who the villain actually is? <br/><br/>Acting: 7/10 (Gal Gadot suits the action actress role, plays out her stunts with finesse, the innocence of Wonder Woman was well played too. Chris Pine was funny to watch with his great comic relief and charisma, but that it was it nothing too great by anyone else).<br/><br/>Action: 7/10 (There were some great visuals amazing sequences where you would go on YouTube and search the particular scenes but some scenes had too many, overly done slo-mo. CGI in some scenes just went from Oscar worthy to a B-Grade student film).<br/><br/>Sound: 7/10 (Wonder Woman theme played well with the action, the explosions, bullets and whips sounded decent in the Dolby Atmos theatre). <br/><br/>Story: 4/10 (Pacing was off, lot of up and down, fast paced to really slow and dull. I'm confused to where the DC universe wants to go? They haven't developed any solid back story that will carry on and tie in to a big finale. From a solo film perspective it was great to see how Wonder Woman became a warrior but the poor use and execution of a villain was major let down. DC is known for villains they should have not gone wrong on this department. Another let down were the side characters, no development, rushed them right into the plot).<br/><br/>Feels: 8/10 (Excellent heart throb moments towards the final act. Really felt the emotion of how it played out. Possible onion eyes for emotional romantic losers).<br/><br/>Final Rating: 6.6/10 (Compared to BvS: 5.5/10, SuicideSquad: 5/10)"

"MendicuttiD","2","2","8","14 December 2018"," The Actual ""False God"" of the DCEU
","I am a superhero movie fan. I wouldn't go as far as consider them masterpieces, but I personally believe that many of them are legit pieces of entertainment and, sometimes, a notorious source of inspiration and imagination for the audience. With that said, you can picture my enthusiasm when one of this films gets one or two Oscar nomination for something more than make-up, visual effects or any of the sound categories (The Dark Knight for example). So, I have to confess that when I found out that Wonder Woman was a serious contender for the awards season of 2017, I just let my hopes go sky high. Unfortunately, reality did its job and got my hopes about this movie down where they belong.<br/><br/>I've never been a huge fan of the Wonder Woman character. The reason behind this is that, very much like Superman, it is a character that has to rely on its unimaginable powers to get enough depth and complexity to be at least considered a good one in the first place and, instead of shining with its own light, it is constructed by the audience´s daydreaming about being like them. In this particular case, the feminist movements and women empowerment reflected on a female character with supernatural powers that grants her with leadership over human beings, many of which happen to be men. Does this give some sense of purpose and energizes the sector of the audience fighting for this cause? Absolutely. However, does this make Wonder Woman a masterpiece? I don´t think so.<br/><br/>I would not submit here any personal opinions regarding this social movement simply because, in this particular space, I am not writing about my position on politics, but about cinematographic projects and their quality. Under that specific rule, I have to label the Wonder Woman movie an overall mediocre film, pretty much like everything that has come out under the DCEU. Gal Gadot does not give a performance beyond the script, which obviously turns her character into a powerful female leader. Let the captain excuse me, but she miserably failed in inspiring any authority for any reason further the fact that she can do things that my humanity does not allow me to do. And being granted such importance just because of that, in my opinion, has no merit whatsoever if we talk about cinematographic quality and narrative.<br/><br/>Awful villain, predictable and empty plot overall, and absolutely nothing that makes it excel between any recent superhero-themed productions (except for the fact that the main character is a woman), this film does not deliver nothing for itself, and it seems that it just stands for the people that feel identified with the character just because of its gender. It only tries to construct a female character that is biologically superior to any man shown in the flick, including her love interest played by Chris Pine, using cheap methods like over exposition and situations in which only a superhero can achieve the main goal. Instead of being a powerful movie from which a new trend that inspire girls to dream with superhero movies too, it seems to me that this is just a sad excuse to keep on whining about everything.<br/><br/>This is a boring and empty film. As a big fan of fictional stories situated on a historical context, I can assure you that not even WWI could make this production at least fun to watch. Again, a goddess that can finish a war with nothing more that her own hands... and that's it. The only highlight against a war hero as the one portrayed in the movie Patton is that she can actually lift enemy troops and trash them against a wall without breaking a sweat.<br/><br/>I personally believe that the Me Too movement against sexual harassment on Hollywood caused this movie to gain significance to the audience, much more than it deserves I think. This is not about the movement itself, which is positive and carries a noble message. However, that does not make this movie any bigger or better. Like an empty glass, filled only by external elements like this empowerment movements, which are totally different from the war fought by Diana Prince, or her battle against Ares, which is very poorly constructed, leaving a sorry and pathetic excuse of a great comic villain. My advice to you is: If you really want to fill your favorite social cause with purpose from entertainment, watch a quality film that engages the topic."

And, with a driving passion to make the world a better place. <br/><br/>The director, a woman, portrays men in the film with extreme sensitivity and respect for true masculinity. The character played by Chris Pine is a true hero. More over, he is a gentleman in the truest sense.<br/><br/>The look of the film is fantastic, e.g. the scene in no-man's land was a tribute to the great Stanley Kubrick (All Quiet on the Western Front). The use of color was extraordinary. For its novelty, I am willing to entertain the strange revisionist history in the film, but I am sorry that the average movie goer has no knowledge of the true events."
"kaustubh-rajnish","9","2","8","10 May 2018"," Finally stunning stuff from the house of DC
","In a movie era known for its superhero movies. It is hard to make a film that tells an origin story, makes a definitive social point of view, is entertaining and above all looks and feels original. <br/><br/>Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman does all that and more. <br/><br/>It has an anti-war message at heart. And has feminism running in it's veins. And mind you - the good kind of feminism (less hate and anger and more fair opportunity). Not to mention it is a film set in WW1 which is actually reflective of today's times.<br/><br/>What drives it is an incredible turn by Gal Gadot whose persona literally makes every scene watchable. Her expressions of surprise, anger, love and empathy pretty much turns Wonder Woman (quite a fantastic superhero if you read the comics) into the most realistic superhero since Nolan's Batman trilogy. She gets full support from Chris Pine (As the superhero 'girlfriend') who does everything right and to be fair is an A-list actor. His scenes of him trying to explain the reality of humankind to WW are alone worth making WW a re-watch. Superhero films definitely need more girlfriend/boyfriend characters like that. <br/><br/>The action sequences are breathtaking. It also finally explains what is wrong with the DC extended universe which is indeed one man - 'Zack Snyder' and the studio should simply change him for a better director maybe - 'Patty Jenkins'. Jenkins btw had disappeared after Monster and returns more than a decade (13 years to be precise) later to the big screen to give us a film that will easily feature in the top 5 superhero movies of all times. <br/><br/>Dont miss this one - arguably one of the best films of what was a terrible movie year 2017."

","I'm not a fan of DC movies, but I was told that this one was very good. I was told by multiple people to go watch this movie. I did. That was a mistake. <br/><br/>Effects/Visuals - The effects are all really bad. The CG is really bad. There is a really bad shot of Wonder Woman jumping in front of a greenscreen that the director loved so much that the shot is reused at the very end with a different background. Some of the set design is decent but its ruined by bad CG. Whenever they aren't filming on location, its just really bad and obvious greenscreens. There's a few hilarious editing mistakes towards the middle of this movie. Some of these points don't sound too bad until you consider the budget of this movie. <br/><br/>Audio - The music is terrible and clashes with what's happening onscreen. Not only does it rarely fit the mood, it also doesn't fit the time period, but I don't think anyone in production cared about that. <br/><br/>Characters - There's a lot of bad acting. The actors aren't given very good direction, and the result is a mess. The only thing that is even kinda believable is the love story. The villain is absolutely terrible. Wonder Woman doesn't really have much of a character. Most of the characters are stupid both in intelligence and in concept alone. Everything is dumbed down to the point where its full of plot holes. <br/><br/>The Plot - Cliche and predictable. Most of the ""twists"" that are in the movie are just things that the audience usually already knows when they come in to watch this movie. The only thing that you could genuinely claim to not see coming is the reveal of WHO the villain really is. Mostly because the villain subplot is massive mess. <br/><br/>The Action - The action is terrible. Its poorly shot and makes no sense. The action scenes would only work in a comedy.<br/><br/>The History - This story takes place in WW1 but the Germans act like Nazis. I'm not an expert on WW1 Europe, but I'm pretty sure were a lot more errors. Also the Germans speak English throughout the movie. <br/><br/>There isn't really anything that this movie does well. There are like 2 or 3 kinda fun scenes but most of it is just boring and nonsensical."

","It's really hard for me to rate this movie. If I start detail analysis of everything wrong with it I'll spend half a day on bashing and I have o go to work in half an hour. First, this is school example of lazy screenwriting. The story is dumb linear, full of holes and illogicalities and characters are terribly developed, without any background or evolution during the movie, which is unacceptable for an origin story. Gal Gadot is perfect for the role, but her acting is artificial and it looks like she poses for every scene. Like if the accent isn't on portraying WW character in the best possible way, but they want to decoy us and draw our attention from bad movie to Gal's unbelievable beauty and skills. Amount of slow motion in action scenes is so excessive that after some time it goes from ridiculous to tragic. I had a feeling like I'm watching ballet adaptation of comic-book on Fashion channel. Special effects are not bad, but it could be done better and more convincing. This looks more like animated than a feature film. Also, in some scenes, it is more than obvious they violently refrained from natural development of the scene only to stay within PG-13 at any cost. If I go into details I could do this for hours. And then again, Gal Gadot is magical, hypnotizing. There are some beautiful scenes and few funny moments. Although I could list its flaws for hours and I have almost no compliments for this movie, I really enjoyed watching it. Briefly, catastrophe, but really entertaining one.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Objectively, I would give it 5/10, but it would be hypocritical to rate so low movie that I will most probably watch again.

","Although I didn't know the plot of the movie prior to seeing Wonder Woman, was aware of positive comments surrounding movie. Having seen the movie I can certainly agree with the positive vibe.<br/><br/>First of all the plot isn't quite what we are used too with a lot of superhero movies. Rather than being set in the future it is firmly in the past. The Wonder Women is Diana who is played by Gal Gadot. There is a real on screen chemistry with pilot Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine) and the plot builds nicely. You care what happens to the characters in the movie and this helps to make the action sequences thrilling. <br/><br/>A lot has been made by the lead role being female, but it is just a good action movie. It's quite possible this will be the best blockbuster movie of the year."

","I'm not sure how the movie could have been any better without being significantly different. But it wasn't exactly amazing, in my opinion. I thought the chemistry and the general romantic attraction between the two main characters was probably the biggest problem. It was superficial and just not very stirring. Maybe a nice, quiet three minute conversation between the two would have helped. You know, whispered voices, provocative smiles, a close-up of a hand offering a gentle caress.<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought some of the superhuman attributes of Wonder Woman were too often either kind of silly, or were used at the wrong times to optimize effect. Maybe I would have a different opinion if I were 15 years old.<br/><br/>It wasn't a bad movie by any stretch but there was something missing that was needed for me to give it a higher rating. As it is, I am not eagerly awaiting a sequel."

"cwglindn","7","2","8","15 June 2017"," Good, Best DC in the last few years, but still Off Target
","First off there will be SPOILERS, So before I get to that I just want to say, If you like superhero genre then you DO want to see this film. It is as good a creation as has occurred in the last few years since the Dark Knight reboot, but DC still cannot GRASP their own characters! (SIDE TANGENT: Ex: Superman always saves the day and is a Boy Scout)<br/><br/>So I watched this a week ago and it has really bothered me to think about what was missed. The WWI background was a small bother due to knowing that Wonder Woman started in WWII, and that the group brought together reminded me of Captain America: The First Avenger. My first thoughts were why did Wonder Woman have to sleep with Steve Trevor? why the awkward sex talk on the boat? Why such week looking villains? And my wife had a similar complaint as others about the thin looking Gal Gadot, but from what I read and saw she did bulk up and did do many of her stunts even while being pregnant. So her size was not an issue to me.<br/><br/>After reflection this week, here is what bugged me. 1) Amazons should have been knowledgeable of the world, knew about crisis's weapons and maybe lost one life on the beach. Hyppolyta should have held the contest to determine the one amazon to go to the man's world and when Diana won, leaving, she should have told Diana that she had power more than she knew she had and that it would also lead Ares to her. Otherwise, the amazons look unprepared, ignorant and cowardly by hiding.<br/><br/>2) The boat scene was reportedly ad lib-ed, but it was fine only if Diana emphasized the wisdom of staying warm, take it or leave it. Instead of emphasizing her lack of experience and 'innocence.' I think this also played in the lead up to the sex part, where a platonic strong love like the Captain America and Agent Carter relationship.<br/><br/>3) Really, you put Diana in a Dress?! Diana chose to wear the local clothing to fit it, not as a innocent trying to find 'fighting' clothes. I think about the first episode of Xena when Xena tries to put her weapons aside to wear peasant garb, but it does not hide her warrior spirit.<br/><br/>4) I could live with the rest and the Diana came out when she left the trenches to fight. But Dr. Poison and Ares, were so weak, especially Ares, and the fight was brute force with not the kind of slick moves I would expect from an Amazon and the long lived Ares God of War.<br/><br/>In summary, it was a good attempt-kind of reminded me of when Micheal Keaton took on Batman after the strong memories of Adam West. It was an improvement, but not on target. It took another set of movies to get the essence down. Just like Christopher Reeve nailed Superman, Wonder Woman has raised the bar but it still has a way to go. Wonder Woman needs to have Intelligence, Wisdom, Strength and lead others, not follow (this happened in Dawn of Justice). She was ahead of the game and Saved the day! There is no innocence to the man's world, she has a Amazon view that she chooses to carry or to voluntarily set aside in order to accomplish a task so that she does not understand or accept the gender bias in our society."
"Lefteris-Anagnostopoulos","7","2","8","15 June 2017"," Wonder Woman: The CPR of a Cinematic Universe
","1. With ""Man of Steel"" being an OK start to DC's cinematic universe and ""Batman V Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"" being downright amateurish especially in their scripts, here comes Wonder Woman to save the sinking ship of DC before it's too late.<br/><br/>2. Right from the beginning I want to say that ""Wonder Woman"" is not a masterpiece. ""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece, ""The Dark Knight"" is a masterpiece, ""Citizen Kane"" is a masterpiece and keep in mind that those movies have their flaws too. I did not want to start my review with negativity but I hate the early praise for movies. I think ""Wonder Woman"" started with 8,something in IMDb and in the top 250 and now it's in 8,1 and of course it will fall below that. Stop doing that.<br/><br/>3. So, putting the negativity aside, I want to talk about the script which is amazing. It was perfectly balanced showing a coming of age story and a superhero origins, I'm sure that on paper it would have been an amazing read. But seeing it on the big screen I'd say that it's pretty mediocre. I put a 7/10 because I believe that the story carried over the movie through its terrible CGI, action scenes and bad acting. <br/><br/>4. I am from Hellas (not Greece), so of course I know our mythology very well and also know that our mythology is just that, myths and stories. The gods and the heroes do not exist (or existed) and also I believe that anyone can take these stories and craft something fresh and new. That is not the case for ""Wonder Woman"" and the Hellenic mythological background of Themyscira. To be honest the mythology is idiotic and it does not make sense. There were moments that I thought ""The director will jump off the screen to tell us: Just don't overthink it, please.""OK movie! I will not overthink it, what else can you offer? And the answer comes in the form of Chris Pine, the standout performance of this movie. I love him, he even might be the best character of this cinematic universe thus far.<br/><br/>5. Patty Jenkins as the director of the movie was a missed opportunity. She delivered an OK movie but in her technique I saw more Snyder (from the slow-mo-speed-up action scenes) than Jenkins. Speaking of the action-scenes: they were terrible. Just terrible. The only time you could see what was happening is when there was slow motion which of course was fueled with CGI (looked fake). Other moments it was the usual recipe of quick cuts and loud sound effects. Oh, and the movie was dark. Very dark, even when there were bright colors on screen, it was dark. Not very good palette. <br/><br/>6. So, let's recap. We have a movie with: poor direction, poor CGI, poor acting and what remains to discuss is Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Passable. She was OK. As I said the script did the best job in the movie. Gal Gadot could say her lines convincingly but she was limited by her acting skills. She and Chris Pine had very good chemistry and let me say that the writers did their homework. Wonder Woman's character was amazing, she was inspiring and brave and naive and I loved her for being that naive. Sometimes in dark situations like World Wars naivety can go places and reach out the darkest corners. There were moments that I wanted to scream ""YES I AGREE WITH YOU!!!"" because her simple questions and curiosity is (and was for the movie) what the (her) world needs. Not to over-think and be stuck in technicalities. People need help. So we help the people. Simple as that but we were talking about ""Wonder Woman"". <br/><br/>7. I almost forgot to talk about the villains of the movie. OK. Forgettable. Boring. One-dimensional. Ares the GOD OF WAR, is practically the devil in the movie, not the GOD OF WAR. In the final showdown I expected to be a sword-fight or something like that, but no. He was just a sorcerer throwing stuff with telekinesis at her. When he decided to wear his armor it was already too late for me to care and too late to be impressed. Almost the entire third act of the movie was OK->bad. Except everything that involved Steve Trevor. <br/><br/>8. Anyway, to wrap up the review. ""Wonder Woman"" was exactly the movie DC needed for their cinematic universe. Manage your expectations and watch the movie. Wonder Woman is a great hero and protagonist, I will not stand another generations of teens to talk about Twilight or 50 Shaded of who gives a f--. We need great female protagonists, not moronic sex objects."
"pailoong","6","2","8","9 June 2017"," A definite improvement in the DCEU, but still lacking
","I've been waiting a long time to see this film and left the theater yesterday feeling strangely unfulfilled. It is MUCH better than ""Batman v. Superman"", but not as good as ""Man of Steel"", in my opinion. Let's not even insult it by comparing it to the Margot Robbie striptease film called ""Suicide Squad"".<br/><br/>Before I go on with one of my two main reasons why this film lacked for me, please know that I am no friend to third-wave feminists. I believe they should all be shot in the face and thrown into a volcano. The pissy political ""women only"" showings are just pitiful and pathetic. Having said that, I was disappointed at the lack of man-hating on WW's part. It's a central part of her character. No men are allowed on her home island (in fact, they're met with death if they try to stay), she has trouble trusting men, she disappeared from the world because of man's propensity for violence and wars... it's part of her weakness as a character and it's something she has worked on and has grown with, eventually trusting her fellow Justice League members and even tolerating Flash's sophomoric advances. in the film, her motivation for leaving the world of men is because her lover died (needlessly, I might add). This is the same as finding out that Wolverine's code name came about not because of his ferocity but because it referenced a story his lover told him (X-Men Origins). I felt there was no growth with her character. It felt lame and weak.<br/><br/>Speaking of weak, with the army of trainers and proved track record with actor's and actresses physique transformations for these superhero roles, there is no excuse for Gal Gadot to look as out of shape as she does. She's not unattractive, but she looks like she hasn't lifted a day in her life. WW is strong and beautiful. She has feminine muscle. In this regard, Gal Gadot looks nothing like the eponymous character and in a world where she's going up against the god of war, Batman and Superman, looking weak is unacceptable. I'm pretty sure I saw her hamstrings jiggle in one scene. This is Wonder Woman!<br/><br/>Like I said, this isn't a bad movie by any stretch and is a definite improvement on the DCEU films thus far (with the exception of ""Man of Steel""). I was entertained, even if the story felt recycled from previous superhero films (some have made the observation that it's the first Captain America paired with Thor 2, which is an apt description). Go see it, just don't expect to be blown away."
"metalrage666","7","2","8","7 June 2017"," A decent addition to the DC universe
","If you're prepared to go in with an open mind and not expect this to right all the wrongs with the recent DC movies, or compare it to the MCU, then this is worth seeing. Considering the constant conjecture that Wonder Woman was even going to get her own movie and that production on this was in the pipeline for years, the end result is a fairly good movie. <br/><br/>As for much of the naysaying, a lot of reviews seem to be focusing on the plot holes, (of which there are a few), and the implausibility of what WW gets up to and what she does, but even with that, it doesn't make for a bad movie in any way. Yes there are the usual comparisons with Captain America; they're both set during world wars, albeit WW is set in WW1 and CA set in WW2, The Germans in WW1 weren't Nazis just FYI. And yes WW's costume is very American-esque and heavily Stars & Stripes oriented, but keep in mind, the character was invented in 1941 and is a truly American inspired character created during a time in history when symbolism was rife and necessary for both sides, so don't hate the movie just because you don't understand the reasons behind something. Also, WW, like many original superheroes, has undergone a dramatic metamorphosis during the bronze, gold, silver and modern age of comics, so her origins, outfit, abilities etc have also altered, so trying to fit all of this into a 2 hour movie & have it all make sense to the uninitiated is virtually impossible. At one point in history, WW was as strong as Superman, so jumping across gorges and punching through stone was not uncommon for her. As for the feminist undertones in the movie, women from the early feminist movement were used as inspiration for this character, so it's obvious that's going to show through.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, to the movie itself; the idea of having this done as a flashback was a good idea, seeing as the live action character had already been introduced, Diana receives her old WW1 photo from Bruce Wayne which triggers her memories& from that we get the origin back story. The movie is enjoyable with several fight sequences done in a mix of reality and CGI effects, along with that slow motion technique being used more and more in movies. You get a flurry of activity and then a sudden slow-mo mid action sequence and then more flurry. If you hate that kind of thing, then you'll hate this as it's in every action segment. Some people love it, others don't. I don't care either way. The action sequence of WW running the German lines across No Mans Land, when the allied advance was in stalemate is perhaps one of the best parts of the movie. Yes it's unrealistic for German machine gunners to only target her shield (that's too small to really protect her), but it's not enough to make me hate this or the mythos of comic books made into movies.<br/><br/>Personally I thing Gal Gadot was well cast in the role, for the look if nothing else. I wasn't expecting Othello or Henry the V, so again, if that's what you're after, you'll hate this. I like Chris Pine who plays Steve Trevor, but thought that he was miscast in this. I couldn't help but feel that I was watching him just being Captain Kirk in this as well; always has to be right, disobeys orders and generally flies by the seat of his pants. For WW1 it's a bit unrealistic. I also didn't get the recruitment of his crack team of commandos who came with him for his incursion through enemy lines as they ended up being worse than useless. He may as well have brought along a team of cheerleaders for all the good they did. But these are all minor annoyances for me and didn't result in me taking my eyes off the screen.<br/><br/>This all brings me to the underlying issue, which is the lack of any defined antagonist and under-utilising of the ones there are. First we have the Germans, who in the dying stages of the war are preparing to negotiate an armistice to end hostilities and one officer who is circumventing all this by developing a secret weapon to tip the scales along with the aid of an actual WW villain, Doctor Poison. I felt that the Germans were just throwaway villains and didn't really add much to the fight. Secondly we have another WW villain, Ares, god of war. It turns out that he's ultimately responsible for WW1 and the manipulation of the efforts to drag the war on and on, however the fight between him and WW at the end felt a bit sloppy and haphazard, and the CGI effects seemed rather lazy when compared to the rest of the movie. The ending ruined it for me and I likened it to someone running out of time to clean a room, so all the dust is swept under the rug. It just felt rushed and the underlying message is that the real enemy here is war itself, so with all the Germans hugging each other after Ares is vanquished and the war essentially over, it's a very syrupy ending.<br/><br/>Personally I think this is still worth a look, it's perhaps not worthy of the hype that's being generated by ""finally"" having a female superhero. I don't get the desire of ""needing"" a woman with superpowers. WW has existed for almost 80 years, plus there's a ton of literary female figures that can empower, so if all it takes is a comic book heroine to provide your empowerment, you never really needed it. It's a good movie, with good effects for the most part. It's enjoyable, funny in parts and sets it up nicely for the Justice League movie."

"cbrownlaw-771-107746","8","2","8","2 June 2017"," Best DC since Batman SPOILERS
","There were several reviewer who intimated this movie was the best comic book movie. Gosh, please don't go see it thinking that. It is a GREAT movie, but it doesn't compare to Logan or Dark Knight. Think ""Thor"" level, I guess, without Loki. Logan and Dark Knight transcended the genre, and this movie does not.<br/><br/>The plot is non-essential, I'm sorry to say. World at war, and all. They picked WWI so as not not mimic Capt America TOO much (though you can switch Cpt America and Peggy Carter and pretty much get WW and Trevor). It is a coming to age story, and is done reasonably well. There is some secret about WW being a living weapon, but frankly we never find out much about the secret through the movie, so it much not have been great.<br/><br/>There are a few great action parts - the action scenes for the most part pretty good - clean, not confusing (not Michael Bay). There is a great leap from Thymiscara to Europe in her abilities, and not much of an explanation. The fight with Aries was normal DC disappointment. A lot of dramatic jumping, which is at least new.<br/><br/>HUGE Wonderwoman fan here, so this movie was going to get an 8 just for picking Gal Gadot. What a great choice! I do not believe her character could have been done better. She has the international flavor, the ancient world look, and has a naivety and sense of hope about that world that makes the rest of the movie better. Other than Gal Gadot, there is one outstanding performance and a few interesting ones. Lucy Davis was astonishing, folk. She was Steve Trevor's assistant. Every scene she had was lifted. Young Diana was played well enough. Sameer was wonderfully played - way to elevate a small part! He was funny enough, interesting, and decently acted. Charlie was really well played - would have like to know more about him, but DC doesn't like characterizations and fullness. ""The Chief"" - he was just there to make Chris Pine look bad, I guess. Smoke signals? FREAKING SMOKE SIGNALS? The Amazons were throw away characters, which was not fair. They could have had internal squabbling or betrayal or something interesting. <br/><br/>There were a few incredibly good parts about the story. The scene in the cave - well that was funny. Not great, but funny. The dressing scenes in London were great (Etta did that). The dancing scene in the town - wow. Just wow. If quality of directing and the lightness of touch in that scene had pervaded the movie, this movie would have transcended the genre.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is not great, folk, though it was entertaining. WW never got close to hurt, though she was not invincible. Moving onto the battlefield was useless CGI. The castle scene - WW med Ludendorff - was just weak. Pine as a spy was as subtle as a machete, which is strange as he has played spies before. <br/><br/>Other than the Batman 3, DC has a bad track record with characterization, and other than WW, this is no different. Chris Pine is a little flat as Steve Trevor - I have seen him better. At the end, you couldn't hear him speak, and you realized that his dialogue was never that important throughout the movie. His death (almost the same as Cpt America, which this movie copies faithfully) had none of the drama and deftness of Cpt America's crash scene. <br/><br/>Danny Houston/Ludendorff had a career low here. Nothing good about his performance, nothing good about his characterization. He was supposed to be a red herring, and the plot about him and his acting was so bad that you knew he was a red herring instantly. His death scene was pitiful.<br/><br/>Anyone NOT know that Sir Patrick was Aries? Seriously? From the first minute he spoke? If you weren't sure, by the time Ludendorff had his 3rd or so scene, it was obvious. What a waste of an incredible actor. You suit up Sir Patrick in armor? How did he get there, anyway? While we can assume a God can move quickly, I usually like better tie ins. His acting ALMOST made up for the bad writing, but he should have been menacing or crazy or intense, and was none of those.<br/><br/>There is some poison woman (Dr. Maru) with a strange face plate that is needlessly thrown in for some dramatic need I cannot ascertain. Not sure what happened to her, and definitely didn't have enough invested to care. <br/><br/>All in all, I will probably pay to see it again just for Gal Gadot. If the plot had been tighter, and there were thicker characterizations, this would have been up there with the three Batman movies. Think about the acting in FURY, folk, and think about how good this could have been if each of the minor characters were given fullness. DC is getting good actors, no denying that. As it is, this movie is an impressive move forward for DC, but it is a reminder AGAIN that they need to get better writers."

","I read so many fantastic reviews of this movie. People actually said it was a perfect movie. Maybe if you're 12. The best thing about this film, the only thing, is Gal Gadot. She has a ton of charisma and is amazing as a warrior princess with the mentality of a three year old. I really think, after having watched this, that the film got high ratings because it was supposed to be the feminist hurrah and it is not PC to rate the first and only feminist comic movie badly. But this movie is LAME. <br/><br/>I have enjoyed so many other comic book movies and was looking so forward to this female driven one. Have to say though, right when it started , I had my doubts. They just worsened as the movie progressed. The issues I had with the movie, were a poorly constructed script. Really cheated out there. No big words. But they made the actors act like they were saying big words. Nothing made sense either .. huge plot holes throughout, and especially in wonder woman's origins. That didn't get filled in till the end. But filled in with scraps. The Amazon island - a lesbian paradise filled with all different races , shapes and sizes , butch and femme. Apparently they do not need men to procreate, oh wait, they do, except there is no men and Wonder Woman was sculpted from clay. The island is hidden from everyone except the gods, oh and that spy in an airplane and the German navel command. Secondly ... the acting was pretty wooden which is shocking because of the talent involved. That just means that the script is that bad. My other biggest problem with this movie was that it was just so unbelievable.. not just with actual events , but the characters just seem like caricatures .. I mean I can watch an X Men movie and totally get into it. But for some reason when I see a woman clad in a bathing suit charge across the western front with what must have been hundreds of machines gun shooting at her and only have to dodge three bullets that magically hit her in the bracelets ; it's too much. Just retarded too much. like no way in heck,too much. Other issues? I appreciate diversity just like the next guy. But to have a Native American, and Arab sitting in a bar in England with a Scotsman? During World War 1, no less? Come on. Just too unrealistic and immature ... this is a great movie for teens and kids and tweens and stupid people. I am a big sucker when it comes to ideals and honor - and when Wonder Woman is giving her sermons on the mount about how great mankind is , i literally rolled my eyes. I fast forwarded through most of it just to see the end and find out if there was any god of war. Its that bad. For adults anyways. Just didn't penetrate and didn't feel anything .. the life lessons were dumb too. The entire script seemed written for a third grader. Yeah. Yeah. We all know people suck and we know we aren't going to be better and we are still worth saving kind of thing. Heard it ll before ... like for two thousand years actually. ( hello Jesus) so this was probably the worst comic book movie I've ever seen besides iron man 3. Save your money and rent it for your daughters."
"mistoppi","8","2","9","23 August 2017"," Amazing!
","Wonder Woman is an amazing superhero movie, and this comes from someone who's a bit tired of superhero movies already, and is really picky about which ones they're going to see. It stands out for several reasons, one of them being that there are more elements from fantasy than science fiction in this movie.<br/><br/>First and most important and obvious thing has to be the fact that it has a female lead. It's ridiculous that it has taken this long for DC or Marvel to actually make a movie with a woman playing the main role, considering there are amazing heroines in the comic books. Diana is an amazing character, because while she's being a hero and kicking ass, she can still be a woman. There are tons of characters who are ""strong female characters"" while strength being their only defining characteristic. But Diana actually has feelings and is feminine without being just eye candy for the male viewers, while still looking absolutely stunning, though. <br/><br/>One thing that bothers me is the excessive use of CGI and slow motion and all that, but Wonder Woman definitely isn't the only movie guilty of that.<br/><br/>Storywise this movie is enjoyable, and I felt amazing after I saw that. Is that how men feel all the time when they see other men in superhero movies constantly?"
"mgk98","Null","2","9","28 July 2017"," Nice superhero-movie but overly American and Hollywoodified and not much of a feminist icon
","I must admit that I'm very disappointed. The movie had been praised for being such a strong movie regarding feminism and finally giving us a non-sexualized, strong, bad ass female lead. This is not entirely the case in my opinion.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is strong and bad ass, that is true. I also love how all the Amazons are strong as hell and incredible good at fighting! But Wonder Woman is still sexualized to the skies! If you look at her outfit: HEELED shoes (they can't be very practical) and a tiny skirt (they could easily have made it just a few inches longer without it having any effect on her freedom of movement). I know that they were probably trying to be true to the comics, but I think they could have pulled that outfit together in other ways and still achieve that. And why would the Amazons, who have been isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years, shave? How did they even come up with that idea? It serves no real purpose. (Just to be clear - I shave and like being shaved, but I'm 100% sure that's because I've been socialized to like it, and I think it's unrealistic that the Amazons would shave).<br/><br/>Another thing I dislike about the movie is the whole WW1-plot. It's one of the most American movies I have ever seen (not meant in a good way), depicting the Germans as literal monsters and insane people, whereas the Brits and Americans are all heroes (very one-dimensional). It's an old, tired, American plot seen way too many times before. Very Hollywood. <br/><br/>Besides all that it has a looot of loopholes. <br/><br/>If you put all these things aside, then it's a nice superhero-movie - it's funny, filled with action and Chris Pine is exceptional. <br/><br/>If the movie hadn't been so hyped and praised I'm sure I wouldn't have been as disappointed. <br/><br/>So, if you like (very American and Hollywoodified) superhero-movies give it a try. Just don't expect too much."

She lives in a beautiful paradise with her own kind, wouldn't she stay to protect her own kind rather than, yeah, you get it..., maybe I'm just not clever enough to understand the nonsensical weirdness of superhero worlds.<br/><br/>Alas there is some positives to take from Wonder Woman, the whole presentation and cinematography was phenomenal, lush, vivid colours in Diana's home land, gritty, worn torn and overtones of dull and dreary darkness in war torn Europe. The action scenes were mildly enjoyable, and Gal Gadot does her utmost best to portray a convincing Wonder Woman, she's no Lynda Carter I'll give her that, but she was a good fit nevertheless.<br/><br/>One more thing that bugged me, Diana's accent, I know Gal Gadot is of Israeli origin, but she doesn't even try to do a convincing American accent, yes I know Diana isn't American, but when in ""disguise"" during the film, trying to portray an American while teaming up with Chris Pine's spy character, wouldn't people notice her accent and realise she wasn't actually American? <br/><br/>Indeed all the hype fell well flat and left me a tad disappointed shall we say, like a kid at Christmas expecting a new bike, but what he actually get's is a new jumper, boohoo! DC just can't keep up with Marvel can they? Alas they will keep trying well into the future."

Ugh! The rewardNOTHING! ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! The wars continued and humanity continues to kill itself off regardless. Let's face it folks, the only purpose of this movie was to introduce Wonder Womanand take your money. Ah hell, the movie continuity wasn't even that great but I blame BvS for that.<br/><br/>GoGv2 was a much more versatile film with bigger stakes using perhaps one of the most obscure teams in comics overall. That's a sign of great writing because you have to build the story and its characters from scratch, keep the audience interested in said story and characters, and keep said story and characters entertaining.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman has had a massive fan base since the early days. Even if it bombed it would have done well in the box office based solely on fandom just as BvS and S.Squad had done. Fortunately it was actually a good movie. I think that's what all of this is about really, rooting for the first DECENT female lead super hero movie (nobody has forgotten Catwoman).<br/><br/>So let's not lose our minds here.

"ConstantinePappas","Null","2","9","4 July 2017"," A worthy movie for a wonderful superhero
","Heard critics reviews and they liked it, saw IMDb users reviews and they are riddled by 1-star reviews. Being a comic reader myself, I felt compelled to watch this movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, wonder woman is a great movie. It's a movie about a female superhero, that as she should inspires hope and fights for the rights of people and their freedom. Thankfully, we don't get cringy I can do it because I am a woman moments in the movie, which in itself makes it more empowering to her character to do so; she does it because she can and because she wants to. Here lies another novelty amongst the slew of comic book movies: it strays away from the gritty but beaten to death ""I didn't ask for this"" moments, or ""superheroes are a danger to humanity"". WW inspires hope and has an inherit benevolence, which makes her a hero you want to root for.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it was pretty good. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine could've carried this movie with just their charm, but they actually built interesting characters with great chemistry between them. WW started as a naive idealist but as the movie progresses she becomes a strong willed woman who stands for and fights for her beliefs. Steve Trevor on the other side starts as a faceless spy who in the end has something to fight for.<br/><br/>The action scenes, especially those set in Themiscyra and the battlefield were she takes down an entire army were amazing and chilling should I say, with awesome direction and cinematography. Direction was great throughout the movie actually, with scenes in Themiscyra being filled with lush green and blues and WW1 scenes being in a shade of brown, almost mudlike.<br/><br/>Now for the not so good parts of the movie:<br/><br/>The villains in the movie got a Marvel treatment. Not that compelling that is. <br/><br/>Dr. Poison actually just created a chemical weapon and that is pretty much it regarding her presence. No fight with wonder woman, no fight with anyone that is, no reason for her being there, no conviction.<br/><br/>The German general was kind of a 80s villain. Just want to be bad for the sake of it. Especially one scene were he does the evil laugh was actually funny in a bad way<br/><br/>The biggest misfire though was Ares. Portrayed by an English fella with a mustache? What? I was hoping this would just be his human form and when revealed, he would take his badass godly one, but nope. <br/><br/>Ares and the scenes concerning him were the worst part of this movie. He was supposed to be the one that took down every god of the dodekatheon, an intimidating, war-torn god. No wrathful moments, just a heavy CGI, a la BvS, 10-minute scene were Wonder Woman discovers she can just kill him, because she is fueled by the power of love.<br/><br/>So overall, it was a great movie. Set a foundation for a sensational character, filled with charm, pure feelings, strong beliefs and badassery. Very interesting origin story, riveting action scenes, actually funny scenes between the two protagonists, only brought down by dull villains and a contradictory to the overall tone of the movie final fight. <br/><br/>8/10"

It turned out to be the best DC movie since The Dark Knight Rises; more enjoyable than Man of Steel or Batman v Superman, but still far less so than an average Marvel film.<br/><br/>I'm not an expert on what it takes to make a great movie. It seems like the actors did well and were well cast. It just feels like something is missing to bring everything together. The magic isn't there."
"homeofthefalcon","4","2","9","1 July 2017"," Wow.... Really?!
","I have never let the whole DC vs. Marvel thing be an issue for me. I like both universes equally - but for very different reasons. This movie is NOT a DC movie. It feels very ... syfy channel with a beefed up budget. The story is so flimsy it's almost unbelievable, the action is VERY ""CGI-cartoony"", the acting is aimed - it seems - at creating ""lovable characters"", but fails miserably. <br/><br/>OK we got the American fly-boy, the native Indian, the stumbling and bumbling middle eastern guy, and the crazy jittery Scotchman.... How freaking original! Never seen those characters together before! LOL. The fact that it's the ""always used generic Arab""-guy, Chris Pine (who actually plays Kirk like 70% of the time, only less sure of him self and a bit... emo?)... and to top it off the dude from Trainspotting - only furthers to make this whole movie feel cheap and unoriginal!<br/><br/>And Wonder Woman herself... Seriously I love Gal Gadot! She is amazing and probably one of the most beautiful women in the world... Seriously look at her in ""Keeping up with the Joneses"" - no one could pull off that role better! ... So you should take it with all seriousness when I tell you she falls FLAT on her rear end in this role... and let me explain why:<br/><br/>1: Her ""hero-shots"" seem too much like ""modeling"". They spent so much time trying to ""show off"" Gal it basically takes over the whole focus of the shots, and in many ways makes them seem laughably staged and unnatural! The CGI doesn't help her here AT ALL! If you want a good example of what I mean - notice her hair in the ""close up hero shots"" ... They CGI'ed it ... it looks REALLY horrible!<br/><br/>2: Her accent and line delivery doesn't fit the character. Again I ADORE her as an actress - but she constantly breaks the immersion by feeling unnatural in the role... It's sort of like George Clooneys portrait of Batman... It's not that George is a bad actor - he just feels WRONG in the role. And YES I'm ACTUALLY comparing the two - because the both left me with that ""MAN this movie could have been cool - but something was off""- feeling...<br/><br/>...... this is already TL:DR ... So I'll stop here - but I could keep going... I keep shaking my head when thinking about it... Seriously guys that CGI .......... SO bad! How this movie is getting an 8/10 rating is crazy... I could make tons of theories as to why this is - but SADLY - non of them is actually about the movie... Calling this a mediocre film of this genre is too being nice in my opinion. It tries really really really ..... really REALLY hard to impress, but it's sort of like a puppy trying to do tricks to get your attention - but then it pees on the carpet in over excitement!"
"sunny-susi","5","2","9","26 June 2017"," OK, good at times, but not great and definitely not revolutionary
","Gender-wise, I didn't see anything in it that was groundbreaking. There have been millions of other movies with strong female leads, with women who get what they want with their intelligence and personality, not their brute strength and fighting skills like Diana. Also, Dr.Poison's portrayal is more anti-feminist than feminist. She is undeniably evil and sadistic, but she's also a female scientist in the early 1900s in Nazi Germany. She overcame gender biases of time and place by becoming a scientist and that's pretty spectacular, but the movie takes away her agency and intelligence when Ares says that he whispered the formulas into her ear. So everything groundbreaking (though terrible, akin to the science behind the atom bomb) that Dr. Poison came up with was not the work of a woman, but of a man. Yeah, gender wise, that's not groundbreaking, it's problematic.<br/><br/>I was also bothered by the way the movie glorifies violence even though Diana is supposedly against war. She's a (supposed) pacifist who spends almost all her time killing people. Also, by glorifying Diana as she fights (she's so graceful, beautiful, skilled) the movie trivializes the fighting and efforts of the soldiers in WWI. The trenches seem so trivial in the movie after Diana leaps right out of them and crosses no man's land in a matter of minutes. <br/><br/>A few specifics that aggravated me: (1) Steve has to explain snow to Diana. She knows hundreds of languages but needs to be told that the falling flakes are snow? 2) There's a Scot in a kilt and an Arab in a fez: played heavily on stereotypes. (3) What's with the Chief hugging a random German after the war ends? And why are all the Germans suddenly peaceful when the plane blows up?"

","This film had the potential to be a decent film, but this potential is completely squandered. The film's strongest point are the characters. Diana and Steve are have fleshed out personalities and world views, and are fun to watch when they engage in mundane conversation. I also enjoyed how unabashedly cheesy some of the other characters were, such as the quirky sidekicks and the absurdly sinister villains. The characters alone would have been enough to earn the film a 6/10 rating, all the film needed to do was have a story that made sense and be competently made from a technical level but the film fails to clear either bar. The cinematography, editing and visual effects are very poor, and make every action scene completely incoherent. The story is riddled with numerous plot holes and inconsistencies, while they aren't obvious during the film are incredibly evident if any thought is given to the story. While I do appreciate the film's attempt at exploring the idea that a black/white morality world view is incompatible with the real world, the grand finale manages to completely contradict this thematic crutch, rendering the story meaningless. I review films based on how good it is rather than how much I liked it. While I liked most of the film, it just wasn't a good movie overall."
"generationofswine","5","2","9","24 June 2017"," An Honest Review
","OK, calm down....I am going to address the ""controversy"" around this first...and I can't believe I just had to write that. It's freaking Wonder Woman!!!!! I can see the X-Men being controversial, what with being primarily about Civil Rights and equality for minorities...but this is DC Comics.<br/><br/>OK, so let me put it this way...<br/><br/>...I do NOT think that Wonder Woman is the greatest female protagonist in an action movie or sci-fi movies...and I am NOT a misogynist.<br/><br/>My ""lack of respect"" of Wonder Woman doesn't stem from a hatred of strong female leads...I just think Sarah Conner (Especially in ""Terminator the Sarah Conner Chronicles"") is the absolute coolest and most bada$$ strong female lead that has ever graced the silver screen or your home television.<br/><br/>Not only that, I was livid when it got canceled and, for the cherry on top, if you want a strong female role model...have one with the cold soldier discipline and the willingness to sacrifice her life for the mission that Sarah Conner has.<br/><br/>Not only that, but to be further controversial, I don't believe that Wonder Woman is the first awesome strong female lead in an action movie. I mean, Ellen Ripely is almost as pure awesome as Sarah Conner...and who can forget Buffy, OK Buffy is touchy, when I mention her I am talking about Buffy from the TV show, not Buffy from the movie.<br/><br/>Those are only to name a few. And then there are lesser ones that we hate yet still came before Wonder Woman....most recently the Ghost Busters and Mary Sue from the new Star Wars.<br/><br/>So cool down on the politics...people that don't think Wonder Woman is the greatest female lead aren't necessarily misogynists forcing a male agenda....they may just be aware of Sarah Conner and Echo.<br/><br/>Now...back to Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE DARK, REALISTIC, AND GRITTY?!?!?! Seriously, I only like one (1) of the Nolan Batman movies and...Wonder Woman and Superman and the Justice League are NOT Batman.<br/><br/>I don't want to sit through a Super Hero movie that is bucking for ultra-realistic. If I wanted that, I'd see a drama.<br/><br/>There are few super heroes that you can go totally dark and Gritty with, Batman, Dare Devil, Green Arrow....<br/><br/>Speaking of Green Arrow, notice how he was dark and the Flash wasn't? Why can the WB understand this but not the film department? What you have here is a director trying to make a Batman movie using Wonder Woman and that doesn't work. If I want a dark and gritty female action protagonist I already have the Terminator and Alien franchises.<br/><br/>the director, the studio, the writers should have concentrated more on making a Wonder Woman film and not another Batman movie...this failed for the same reason Batman V Superman did."
"book-96014","5","2","9","23 June 2017"," I think this movie could have been more enjoyable without
","I think this movie could have been more enjoyable without the forced and faint social message approximations sprinkled here and there. These messages need be given against the background of an intellectually strong script in all its aspects. Otherwise, they do not go beyond being common platitudes that seasoned audiences are tired of seeing and watching. Apart from a yawn, however, the desire to integrate these banalities into the movie provokes glaring discrepancies in character development. We are expected to stand in awe as an Amazon, who received war training since she was a little girl, engages in anti-war tirades that neither grounded in experience, nor in reason but in sheer impulse. Granted, some impulsive acts may be admirable, but I think it takes more than that be a hero. Similarly, WW is very touched when she beholds people who have been maimed in war, and at times even expresses sympathy for German soldiers. Yet, she does not hesitate to kill enemy soldiers on the spot during her encounters with them. Therefore, her character falls short of consistency. And a character that is not consistent is no character at all."
"milstar","5","2","9","21 June 2017"," Good superhero spectacle, but overrated
","I watched it yesterday. First and foremost, I'll have to say this. I'll warn you that I may be chauvinistic to both sexes here. I was doubtful if female director can successfully pull off a testosterone ""male"" oriented blockbuster. Point Break is awesome, but Hurt Locker and Punisher:WZ I found to be boring and uninteresting. However, when it as announced that woman will direct WW, I felt they got it as I believe that only a female director can give the character justice. Of course, it if was a guy, it may totally be the same movie, so I digress.<br/><br/>But first before getting on the movie, let me say that I am not much of a fan of WW (neither I read many comics - Perez I love, Azzarello run and Hiketeia I intensely dislike, though I admire what the Finch couple did). About the movie: I think it's very, fair, honest and sympathetic portrayal of the title character, the best it can get and much in vein of Donner Superman IMO. Moreover, Gal is beautiful, sexy and lethal in equal measures (though I am bit nostalgic for Linda Carter:grin:) And this WW is bereft of the superhero antics I find in Nolan/Snyder verse, where are frustrated, confused character with phrases like:""should I do it; who am I; it hurts me being superhero, hurts me when being not..."". No, this character is a hero and wants it to be. And I believe, just as the poster for Superman (1978) - ""You'll believe a man can fly"".<br/><br/>On the other hand, the plot is already chewed-up and clichéd. It didn't engage me much. I am not particularly convinced with Pine's performance (but he did good). Thewlis, though, ruined it for me. His later ""reveal""... well, can't say I've seen it coming, but it didn't surprise me, either. Also, I find the main villain fight to be a bit cheap, tedious, and unconvincing, with WW all of suddenly unleash all her fury, before seriously eating dirt.<br/><br/>As for action scenes; the special effects are impressive, but the action itself I find just ostensibly thrilling. Don't know, probably because, I've grown spoiled, petulant and craving for more over the years, so that nothing much can surprise me. And flawed he may be, Snyder knows how to make a glory spectacle. Sorry, Patty."
"tpark-46368","7","2","9","18 June 2017"," Average Movie That is Not Close to the Hype
","To be truly honest, the reason why this movie is loved so much is because of the women's rights undertone people are weaving in. It seems that it is simply culturally and politically ""correct"" to be in love with this movie in the context of the current feminist movement embraced by major entertainment and news outlets. But let's look at the movie by its merits. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a perfectly average and entertaining superhero movie. The movie does have ""aha!"" moments that make us feel as though we have made moral strides toward better treatment of women, and it does focus on that issue rightly through this character. But here are the parts the movie falls short: <br/><br/>The movie, I think, has foregone that philosophical dialogue ""Man of Steele"" and ""Batman vs. Superman"" have undertaken under Zack Snyder. Many have seen the philosophical aspects of the previous two DC movies as its weakness. I think the studio took a wrong turn; they should have doubled-down on it and make the message clear. <br/><br/>The choice of setting as WW1 instead of WW2 is not coincidental, I think. The main antagonist is Ares, a god who manipulates people. WW1 is as gray as a war gets in modern history: there is no clear good and evil like, say, WW2 and the Korean War. The script could have explored the exploits of British imperialism along wit the cruelty of the Germans. But the movie went full WW2 and vilified the Germans only. In turn, the purpose of Ares is next to useless. <br/><br/>Speaking of Ares, the last fight scene was too cartooney in comparison to the rest of the movie. The previous fight scenes were of gritty fields of no-man's land. But the last scene was of a British gentleman cosplaying with a horned set of armor. <br/><br/>Another part is the complete lack of character development except Wonder Woman. The movie's protagonists are diverse, but getting diversity points is all they are good for. Sure, they have a few wisecracking lines here and there, but any character or actors could have delivered that. <br/><br/>The real highlight is Gal Gadot's portrayal of Wonder Woman. Many, including myself, loved her as Wonder Woman in Batman vs. Superman. She may be enough to dazzle the viewers into loving the movie. But, sadly, that is the only thing that's outstanding about the movie. Under stricter scrutiny, Wonder Woman is not great. It's good and entertaining, to be sure. But it's not one for the history books."
"tdongchen","5","2","9","18 June 2017"," great start, but with a bad ending
","The movie has a good start telling the story about the amazons, building characters personalities, it was funny too. But in the middle of the story, everything about the amazons was thrown. Ares appears out of nowhere, trying to manipulate the Wonder Woman, with a boring fight. Summing up, in my opinion, the movie has a great start, but with a bad ending<br/><br/>Sorry. English is not my native language."
"amine_chergui","6","2","9","16 June 2017"," Whats up with the special effects???
","OK so i was shocked at how inconsistent the special effects were in the movie. One great example is when, at the beginning of the movie, the young wonder woman (as a kid) jumps a few stories down and you could actually feel that there is a green screen behind, it was like we were back in the 90s. Apart from that the story isn't that great, i mean nothing special will surprise you really in the movie and a lot of parts reminded me of the Captain America first movie with all the fighting the German stuff and the hero having a diverse(nationality wise) special hit squad. Lastly, i would say that if you just want to watch a superhero action movie to pass the time, this will due. Otherwise, stick to the marvel universe"
"CherryBlossomBoy","5","2","9","15 June 2017"," Just stick to your bloody guns!
","Lately, DC have made some critical and commercial blunders which have seen them falling greatly behind the Marvel's juggernaut of dependable high-profit PG-13 films. An ideal response to the success of the competition would be to try and raise the quality of one's own products, but DC seem to think being more like Marvel is the way to go. That didn't do any favors to ""Suicide Squad"" and it's even worse a course of action for ""Wonder Woman"". There are too many good things to call ""Wonder Woman"" a bad film. It's not bad, it's just not as good as it could have been if it was allowed to benefit from DC sticking to their guns and be dark and serious.<br/><br/>Coinciding with the centennial anniversary of the USA entering the World War I, the choice of the setting couldn't be better. There aren't many WWI films out there, and it's a great topic to be explored even if it's just a vehicle for a superhero origin story. To that regard, I found the script remarkably restrained in the usual playing fast and loose with history, and I didn't notice many jarring transgressions other than making a historical German general Ludendorff a comic book villain. The general feeling of depression, futility and hypocrisy of ""The War To End All Wars"" is there, and that's what counts. Then there is that mesmerising golden-brown cinematography that is by now an established trademark for DC. Nowhere else did it serve a better purpose than in this throwback to the era of early colour photographs, and it helped the film look even more 1910s. The opening scenes, set in the Ancient Greece, quite make up for the current lack of good Greek mythology-themed films out there. Gal Gadot is very comfortable and believable as the titular heroine, with her presence and thick accent working very much in her favour. David Thewlis made wonders beyond what his dialogue would allow and was a pleasure to watch. Some action scenes, especially in the grand finale, do strike an emotional chord and are done rather neatly and cleanly, which is quite a refreshment in the sea of overedited, choppy action of nowadays.<br/><br/>Too bad the shortcomings of ""Wonder Woman"" stick out just as well as the good parts. There is, firstly, the silly plot. There are pronoun games, heavy handed expositions, twists and revelations which even a mildly keen viewer typically guessed halfway through the film. The motivation of the main character is incoherent, sometimes illogical and it often serves just to make the plot points happen. The vacuum between anything happening is filled with dialogue that ranges from awkward and clumsy to downright stupid. One exchange went like this: ""Humanity is good!"", ""You are lying and I must kill you!"", ""I believe in love!"". One doesn't get to hear that in an A-film often.<br/><br/>The ""Marvel"" part comes in the shape of the characters that help Diana aka Wonder Woman throughout the film. Chris Pine's rendition of Steve Trevor is over the top awkward. He never connects to Diana properly and the implied love story is unbelievable. Pine does have his moments thanks to his boyish charm, but generally he has been let to do too much. The sidekick characters do even worse. They are too goofy and their dialogue is too frivolous and trying too hard for a comic relief that they just stick out like a sore thumb in the gloomy setting. Also they are not given anything meaningful to do so they more or less just clutter up the screen and the screen time. Greatly lacking is the mise en scène. The backdrop is there and the sets are impeccably designed. But the scenes in London are not populated enough with interesting characters and the film would benefit from more people reacting to the novelty of armor-clad woman in the post-Victorian England. It would also benefit from showing more grit and horrors of the WWI, but I guess in the battle for the PG-13 label sacrifices had to be made.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the fact that one of the most expensive films with a female as the main character has been directed by a female director. It has even been touted as a big deal by recent female presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. Unfortunately, Patty Jenkins did in this production the same thing Mrs. Clinton would have done in the Oval Office - get lost. A Wander Woman, if you will. She lacks pace, focus and determination. Her shots are all over the place, editing is slow and inconsistent and the film overally doesn't get off the ground until it's almost over. She seems to leave the main actors too much on their own, but what's worse, she even lets the extras overact. Someone with a tighter grip over the production was sorely needed here. Jenkins just aimed to please the powers that be. The difference between the good and the bad action scenes in the film prompt me to believe that Zack Snyder took over at least for the final showdown, because that particular scene was almost every bit as good as the finale of ""Batman v Superman"". If that one was also done by Jenkins after all, power to her.<br/><br/>""Dumb but good-looking"" is not the label I like to ascribe to DC films. Not that they've ever been overly smart, but I remember how seeing ""Man of Steel"" left me with the feeling ""man, that's how it should be done"" and I wanted more of that. Come to think of it, I can't even say that the new direction is really trying to emulate Marvel. It's just an aimless departure from adult themed stories in the hope of winning that teen buck. And sure enough, the screening I attended was filled with kids. They were laughing in all the wrong places."
"pokedom","5","2","9","14 June 2017"," Meh. Could have been MUCH worse.
","This is by far the best DC cinematic universe movie that's been released to the public as of the time of writing. Does that say much on its own? Yes, but then you look at the other films and you realize just how much that actually means.<br/><br/>Let's start with positives. For a DC movie, I actually cared about the plot and main leads. The other films are so incredibly dull and full of themselves that they forget to make a plot that makes sense. In this one, Chris Pine (Steve) and Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) have great chemistry and have a good end goal. The plot makes sense and you actually care about the two stars.<br/><br/>Sadly, that's where the positives shortly and abruptly end. Everything else ranges from mediocre to terrible. Every actor outside of Gal and Chris ranged from meh to bleh. The best example of this is the supporting cast. The ""meh"" is the actor guy and the Scottish sniper who is haunted by war flashbacks. Those guys do an okay job. The ""bleh"" is the Native American guy, who just does stuff to contribute to the plot with no real rhyme or reason.<br/><br/>The villains all suck. Dr. Poison doesn't do much other than be a catalyst for the plot. If you took out... Lutendorf? Lugermorph? Ganondorf? If you took him out, nothing would really change. I really like Ares, but they chose the absolute worst actor they could for the role. I cannot look at this villain and not think ""Hey, it's Remus Lupin!"". Even in the final fight, his mustache is still visible, which ruins the spectacle.<br/><br/>All the effects are extremely fake looking. The Lasso of Truth cannot be made to look faker even if you tried. The one fight scene where Wonder Woman actually uses it is the fakest looking thing I've seen in a while. Even basic effects like bad green screen still stick out, like that one scene where young Wonder Woman jumps off a roof, and the green screen is so obvious it hurts the eyes.<br/><br/>Ultimately this film does do some good, but most of the other stuff does tend to undermine the good stuff. Mind you, the good stuff is worth the price of admission, just be prepared for other, less good stuff."

"Barbossas_Apples","7","2","9","4 June 2017"," Really wanted to love it
","This movie had everything I could want: A female lead, Chris Pine, and fantastic reviews. I went in with high expectations, excited to see this film that nearly everyone was praising, and for its part, it did sort of fulfill those expectations... until the last third of the film.<br/><br/>The first two thirds of Wonder Woman were exactly what I'd read online; they were fun, funny, and exciting. Gal Gadot is charismatic, entertaining, and really connects with the audience. The chemistry between her and Chris Pine is fantastic; their banter in the first two-thirds of the film is really what makes it worth watching. Enter Lucy Davis and the film becomes even more fun.<br/><br/>The fun is what keeps the film afloat and keeps the audience engaged, and the fun is what is suddenly sacrificed in the third act. The movie abruptly switches from refreshingly light-hearted to tiresomely typical of a comic book movie. The villain reveal is obvious, but I could forgive that if the show down were at least interesting. Instead, it is reminiscent of just about every comic book movie and quite frankly becomes boring. The fun, smart dialogue and pacing is sacrificed for an overly long, predictable, and clichéd fight scene. All of the emotional and character-based build-up is set aside and I found myself honestly not that affected by any of the sacrifices or revelations. Overall, it was seriously boring and Ares was a waste of a potentially great David Thewlis.<br/><br/>This disappointment is in addition to the excess of characters suddenly introduced halfway through the film. We see Etta fairly early on, so I expected her to have a larger role - and I was quite looking forward to that because I enjoyed her, Diana, and Steve on screen together - but she was set aside for three predictable and forgettable characters, who were half-developed and honestly quite pointless. The three could have easily been combined into one, which maybe would have given the audience a chance to connect with him.<br/><br/>Overall, I found it a little difficult to review and rate this movie. As I said, I enjoyed the beginning and the middle and would rate those a solid 8.5/10. However, it falls apart at the end and quickly checks every genre cliché that it had so deftly previously avoided. It's worth seeing, but it's not the game changer that internet would have you think it is."

Now the problems: Stop with the superhero poses. There must have been 40 of them in this movie. Also, the editing, especially near the end seemed to have poor continuity.

Feminine charm & grace going hand-in-hand with super strength and badassery.<br/><br/>But apparently, DC has resigned itself to the fate that it is secondary to Marvel when it comes to the Cinematic Universe. Film after film dropping far below expectations, completely falsifying anticipations that have built up for decades. Continuously handing over the directorial job to people not fit for that purpose.<br/><br/>This sheer non-seriousness on the part of the DC administration almost feels like villainous in intent; as if DC itself is the greatest villain of its universe, destroying superhero after superhero with half-baked ideas, unnecessarily long scripts, and predictable story lines.<br/><br/>Hats off to Chris Pine, outshining everything else in the movie and for appearing more radiant than even Wonder Woman in certain scenes.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman fits the look and personality, but with limited acting range (one could count the number of her facial expressions on fingertips!) and an unfit screenplay, she comes off as only a shadow of the 'Amazonian demigoddess'."

Note: I loved the use of slow motion cameras, combined with the soundtrack."
"ctowyi","6","3","17","2 June 2017"," A female hero and a female director will show what other ways the superhero game can be played
","After all the big budget misfires, the DCEU really needed to score one and Wonder Woman has delivered a glorious goal. This is a coming-of-age tale, an origin story, a romantic comedy, a 1918 period movie and a superhero genre tentpole flick all rolled into one blistering motion picture. This is a winner! Batman, Superman, Suicide Squad who?<br/><br/>After a brief prologue set in modern day Paris, we are brought to the timeless mystical Island of Themyscira in an extended flashback sequence. We meet Diana, daughter of Amazon Queen, Hippolyta (Connie Nielssen). She longs to join the ranks as a fearsome Amazon warrior and her aunt, Antiope (Robin Wright) wants to train her. The story begins in earnest with the crash landing arrival of American spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) who works for British Intelligence whom Diana rescues. <br/><br/>IMHO the brightest spot of Batman vs Superman is Wonder Woman. Here in her very own spotlight, she shines like a beacon of hope for the franchise. The casting of Gal Gadot is an inspired choice and her femininity and her strong character form a hypnotic aura around her. This is not femininity of the weak kind; she doesn't look into Chris Pine's blue eyes, disappear into them and forgets all her fighting skills. She is a woman with conviction and yet she is always inquisitive. She is athletic, strong, knows her purpose in life (even though it will take her a while to get there) and statuesque in her convictions. She has compassion and feels for the common folk. In short, she is a breath of fresh air. Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman (henceforth WW) is directed by a woman, Patty Jenkins, best known for Monster (2003) which won Charlize Theron the Best Actress Oscar. Her narrative voice is refreshingly distinctive and she blazes a new path for the overcrowded superhero genre. WW draws strength from Diana's growth in character and learning her ultimate place in humanity. As much as it is about that, it is also about a world torn by war earning their right to have her. This wise narrative trajectory gives the story gravitas and emotional heft. Most movies of this sort tend to embed an action scene every 10 minutes, but WW takes a different path and IMHO the quiet moments are also its strongest moments. Even when the action scenes rolled in, there is a ""never seen that before"" awesome feeling. The scene of Diana running head-on into the German front is superbly shot and has so much emotional power that I won't be forgetting that for a long time.<br/><br/>Chris Pine is definitely Gadot's counterpart. Their chemistry feels genuine and I especially enjoy their double entendre dialogue. Pine's Steve Trevor is a man of that begotten time period, he doesn't react immediately after laying eyes on a beauty. He bides his time and treats her with respect; he earns the right to be with her by being who he is, a patriotic soldier and a chivalrous man. Tell me you don't want to see that more in these present times.<br/><br/>Up to this point, I sound like I am describing a superhero genre masterpiece and if you scroll down and see my score, you will probably feel it doesn't commiserate with what was written. As much as I think it is a very satisfying movie, it derailed for me in the final act in the typical bombastic manner with which all the emotional built-up is thrown out the door and in its place comes the Defcon One city-leveller noise. Thankfully, Jenkins does anchor one particular scene with an emotional heft seldom seen. At 141 minutes, WW does require some judicious snips and the villains do deserve better. But all these don't take away the fact that it is the best movie in the DC extended universe to date. It is super fun, satisfying, dare I even say edifying, and in a genre populated by men, it takes a female hero and a female director to show in what new ways the game can be played."
"calebjalbers","7","1","3","2 July 2020"," Strong Lead Character With Disappointing Ending
","The film has a lot of good things going for it, and is probably the best of the recent DC movies (not that the bar is high). Wonder Woman herself is excellent, and makes a strong argument in favor of including more female superheroes. Positive messages are here, but not epic feels in your heart. One good character is not enough. I'm sure other people liked Chris Pine's character more than I did though. He wasn't bad, just not particularly interesting. They seem to have relegated him to the traditionally female role (which itself needs to be fixed) of being 1 dimensional and without much depth or thought. Like his character exists entirely as a romantic interest and as eye candy; which is typically how film treats women. That aside, everything works well together until the finale. Which has the result of establishing a lot of forward momentum throughout the film only for that momentum to cause hard skidding against the ground when the end falls flat on its face."

"Eric266","6","1","3","26 February 2018"," I Was Expecting Better
","I'm not quite sure why this movie didn't move me. As I sat down to write this review, I realized I really don't remember much about it. That is the problem. Its not really memorable. All the accolades and high ratings it received, I was expecting it to knock my socks off. Instead, it just barely held my attention for 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is a wonderful Wonder Woman. I think she embodies the character very well, but it was the writing and directing of her character that bothered me most. In a movie about women's empowerment, it showed just how far Hollywood has to go. The movie takes great pains to beat us over the head with how chauvinistic the men of 1918 were, but then spends the rest of the movie sidelining Diana in favor of Chris Pine's Steve Trevor. Spymaster Trevor drives the plot and Wonder Woman is just along for the ride. That was kind of an odd choice for a movie that is supposed to be about Wonder Woman. It should have been called Mighty Man.<br/><br/>Chris Pine does a great job with the role of Trevor. The men he recruits for his undercover mission are pretty 2-dimensional, however, and are standard super hero sidekicks (think of the Howling Commandos from Captain America). David Thewlis is wasted as a minister who initially seems to be on their side, but eventually turns out to be Ares, the God of War. He goes into full overacting mode at the end, just screaming his lines. This plotline was utterly ridiculous and dumb. The final fight scene is both unintentionally hilarious and poorly scripted and executed. This is barely above 30 year old Japanese animation. At one point, WW jumps through the air to attack Ares and she is seen mouth agape, screaming, as streams of brightly colored lights flash around her. I fully expected her to open her eyes and for there to be no pupils.<br/><br/>I still can't quite figure out why Danny Huston as an evil German general is in the film. He is just a misdirection so you think he is Ares. That is just lazy screenwriting. Anyone who watches Law and Order knows the ultimate perp is never the first guy they see or catch.<br/><br/>The one part of this movie I liked was the first third of the film on Paradise Island. However, like every other aspect of this movie, they rushed it. We never get to fully understand Diana's motivations. Characters say one thing, but do another. Example, her mother insists Diana not be trained, but 3 minutes later she asks that she be trained better than anyone. No development, no plot points, just complete 180 by a character. The opening fight scene on the beach is where I realized this movie jumped the shark/nuked the fridge. Not to compare it to Marvel, but the Captain America fight scenes during WWII were realistic and at least had some respect for time and space. The Amazonian women fight as if they are trying out for Cirque du Soleil. They jump, spin, pirouette, flip and roll, all before even attempting to shoot their bows. It makes no sense that you would fight like that. And it was all done in slow motion, I guess to show how cool and in shape they are. Had they done this in actual combat, most would be dead before they hit the ground. As a tactic, it made zero sense.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie I really liked, was the byplay between Diana and Steve. Their conversations are witty, funny, and enhanced the plot. Diana trying to understand 20th century Europe should have been the main focus of the entire film. We didn't need a huge war segment or a lot of CGI action scenes. Just her learning to adjust to ""civilization"" would have been a tremendous movie. I'd start to get into their dialogue, but, then another dumb action sequence comes along and I am back to laughing at the movie again. The director could not decide on a tone and it really hurt the overall product.<br/><br/>I simply do not understand how DC keeps screwing up these amazing characters. You have some top-notch talent here, both in front of and behind the camera, and its utterly wasted. The problem with misfiring on these movies, is it affects fans' opinions of the other movies in the universe. Marvel movies are almost all a hit and it drives interest in the next one. I detested Man of Steel, but I really liked Batman v Superman and thought Suicide Squad had its moments. I was really looking forward to this film. (I have not seen Justice League) Nothing about Wonder Woman makes me in a hurry to see JL or Aquaman, or any other DC movie. They are all just imploding the brand."
"jrthawk86","7","1","3","18 February 2018"," Is Diana just the Amazon equivalent of a teenager?
","I was looking forward to a badass female lead superhero movie. For the most part that's what I got. Unfortunately for most of the movie it felt like Diana was just acting like a stubborn teenager that knows better than everyone else, ignoring even seemingly simple requests by her supposed partner in action. I get that some of this may have been on purpose to show her naivety to how this world behaves or her vigor to help make a positive difference or the idea that I don't need a man to tell me what to do, or maybe just played for comedic effect to some extent. I don't know. But it just put me off a little. Like this guy is clearly trying to help, can you just listen to him for one second? Also really played up the romance angle more than I expected for what I thought was supposed to showcase the strong independent woman. By the end of the film she seems to have grown and hopefully will be less irritating in the future. Rant finished. Overall I thought it had good story, acting, action and effects."
"brailsford","7","1","3","29 November 2017"," It had some fun moments and was a good watch, too long though
","This movie with the exception of Man of Steel is the best thing to come out of DC connected movie franchise so far. It has an interesting prequel to her appearance in Batman V. Superman where you get to see her history coming into being and what lead up to her becoming the super hero she is today.<br/><br/>It takes place back in WWII which makes some ways makes one think at times about Captain America: The First Avenger, although the problem here is the non action elements in some cases draw on too long and aren't entirely interesting or even all that relevant in the end.<br/><br/>The fights and the villain are entertaining though and it results in a satisfying ending in the end. If you can forgive it for dragging in places, you probably will like it overall."
"sulinc","Null","1","3","16 November 2017"," It was a great movie... until...
","Let me be clear. I am not a Marvel fanboy nor am I a DC fanboy. I love both equally. In 2008, I remember going to go see the Dark Knight and Iron Man and I loved them both. It is possible to like DC AND Marvel. Now, on with the review. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman, the movie with as many expectations to live up to as BvS. It had to prove that you can make a good female-lead superhero movie, a good World War 1 movie, revive the DCEU, inform the audience about Wonder Woman and her powers, and much more. But overall, this movie succeeded. <br/><br/>For the first two acts, this was a fantastic film! The ole ""show, don't tell"" technique was used well in this movie. Instead of telling the audience, ""Wonder Woman can do this and that"", it showed off her powers and abilities. As she was learning what she could do, the audience was learning along with her.<br/><br/>However, just like the three previous DCEU films, this movie ended in an absolute mess of CGI. The casting of Ares was awful and not intimidating. If the movie ended right after Diana killed Ludendorff, and she looked around and saw that one man was not responsible for all of the evil in the world, it would have been a top-notch film. But... as it turned out, one man was responsible, so then she had to fight him while he screamed things like, ""I MUST DESTROY YOU!!!!!"" <br/><br/>It would have been nice if it had ended as I described, but you can't be perfect."

"austin0731","7","3","18","8 June 2017"," Finally, after the atrocities of this cinematic universe's earlier entries we have a great film
","I was very pleases with the outcome of Wonder Woman and it is a real relief for comic book movie fans after the mess of BvS and Suicide Squad. I like pretty much every part of this film, from the amazing DC logo at the beginning of the film teasing the future of DC and Warner Bros.' cinematic universe to the acting to the script. An empowering film that represents women in film like none other before. Just think about the female lead superhero films that were predecessor of this film. (hmmm, Catwoman and Supergirl). <br/><br/>On the point of having a whole new representation of women in film I have to say it was handled quite brilliantly and seamlessly. Patty Jenkins did not push the thing so much that it becomes on the ball and as many of you who have met the 'extreme feminists' may know, they do not represent women in their best light.<br/><br/>Anyways, I thought that Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were both really good, and I very much liked the fish out of water situation depicted in both Themyscira and London. I thought that the film remained faithful to the source material in terms of this and also in terms of the costume. Gal Gadot is just so well casted in my opinion, despite the earlier criticisms. She nails it as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince, she sold the naivety act and still was able to sell bad ass combat sequences. Resulting in a very likable and strong female lead character. <br/><br/>Another highlight I would like to mention is the opening scene on Themyscira, which once again focuses on the empowerment of women, but the whole battle sequence between the Amazons and the Germans was just so cool and exciting and Themyscira had such a great immersive and mystic aura I really enjoyed.<br/><br/>Now about David Thewlis as Ares, I can see that they are going for the older NEw 52 Ares yet I personally would've liked to see the old blue armour wearing, more menacing version of the character. Although Thewlis is great and I can see the reasonings behind his casting I would've loved to see that younger and more threatening Ares, because at the end of the day Thewlis just seems like a rather nice guy."

""I want to fight!""
""You can't! It's too dangerous! You don't know the truth!""
Come the climax, there are few (if any) surprises left.<br/><br/>The action sequences are few and far between, damp squibs that attempt to compensate with excessive use of slo-mo (revealing Zack Snyder's firm hand in the production).<br/><br/>The movie riffs too heavily on Marvel's better efforts - god-like fish out of water (Thor)? Check. Hidden island of peace (Black Panther)? Check. Shield-wielding war setting (Captain America)? Check.<br/><br/>It's a female empowerment movie that still feels the need to give the protagonist a white, all-American love interest.

","James Cameron put it better than I ever could, and more favorably at that. The undo criticism that has been castigated on him is all you need to know if you're curious how this movie got such 'rave' reviews.<br/><br/>It's not really and action movie beyond 3 scenes. It's not really a drama, there's a profound lacking of character depth outside of Chris Pine's character, Steve Trevor. Some of that is no doubt intentional, Wonder Woman has always been naive - but that had before always been one of her more alluring traits. In this movie, it seems that's her only weakness.<br/><br/>Superman at least has kryptonite to give us the impression of danger. He might die. This version of Wonder Woman... only way to kill a god is by another god. Presumably Ares and Zeus are dead, so what threat is there to Wonder Woman at this point? There's no fear of 'oh my gosh! Is she gong to make it?' There's no suspense.<br/><br/>Steve Trevor is the hero of this story. He's constantly putting himself on the line, putting himself in danger, and is there every step of the way in the scenes where Wonder Woman decides to put him at risk by doing something impulsive and misguided.<br/><br/>To put it another way - take last year's (2016) Moana. There is no doubt that Moana is the lead protagonist doing the most good, even encouraging the demigod Maui when his spirit and powers were broken. Steve Trevor even fit the role of amazing navigator (remember how he sailed from the Eastern Mediterranean to London in a world where the Germans still have a navy in 1918?) like Moana. Wonder Woman fit the role of Maui, except she was a full on god who's unlocking new powers at a faster rate than Superman.<br/><br/>And that, sadly gives us the comparison to last year's (2016) stinker Batman v Superman which introduced this version of Wonder Woman. At least that movie had action and suspense, if similar poor execution on both. At least there was the question of 'what's going to happen next?' or 'will the make it?'.<br/><br/>It's understandable given outside forces that this movie was able to float. But let's not kid ourselves in pretending this was groundbreaking beyond anything other than it's revenue."

","Gal Gadot was an interesting choice for the part. Not exactly what I would envision aesthetically as the ideal choice for the part, but she's a good enough contrast to the seemingly clueless male co-stars. <br/><br/>The beginning of the movie is quite lovely. Kudos to those responsible for picking out all the amazing backdrops, which distract you from the twisted plot. Great casting for Queen Hippolyta and Thia Eva (the Amazonian general), but some of the other Amazonians were also a bit much. They're stronger and more physically adept than any other women in the world. We get it.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of everyone's treatment of Diana in general. Without offering any serious spoilers, her character is always viewed as ""distracting"" at various levels both on and off the island. The only way she gets attention is by being ""loud Greek girl"" or just ignoring everyone and jumping into the fray without a clue. The greatest possible weapon she could have -- full disclosure of who and what she really is -- is never offered to her. In truth, the back story of why she exists is a huge departure from the comic tale AND also an insult to the Amazonian myth that is being used as the backdrop of the story. Did Disney buy out DC Comics too?<br/><br/>Chris Pine is eye candy, as always, but the constant references to how spectacular a physical specimen he is (as part of countless plots in ALL his films) is getting old. Is it something he insists on having his his contracts? If not, it's too Tom Jones. Give him a new line, someone. PLEASE. He's actually a good actor otherwise.<br/><br/>Next, the only characters throughout the movie who have a positive view of strong/intellectual women are highlighted as ""the bad guys"" in major ways, which was very upsetting.<br/><br/>In short, it's not a proper Wonder Woman film and goes against the most fundamental precepts behind the creation of the character.<br/><br/>There ARE some humorous moments in the movie, including some of Diana's cluelessness about men and the modern world, but the joke is taken a little too far.<br/><br/>One of the funniest scenes is actually when she's dead serious and clad in blue.

Wonder Woman has incredibly severe flaws that can't make it a *good* movie by any stretch of the imagination. <br/><br/>Probably the biggest issue is the acting. Both leads have very limited acting skills... It takes you out of the movie more often than once. Some scenes are forced, some dialogue overdone like an SNL skit... simply not possible. The ultimate bad guy is a joke. Straight out of GOD OF WAR PlayStation game (really). Not credible for a second.<br/><br/>And, also, on a more personal note, this is the moment where I realized the Zack Snyder school of filming action movies needs to be abandoned. Over abundant jumping, too heavy slo-mo... after three? four? movies of that; it's time to retire it. <br/><br/>It's a shame really because the movie started well enough: having a female lead was great; the Greek mythology clicked for the most part and the World War I setting was nice.

This would not have been an issue but the story line was tedious. The usual she/he will have to find out the true nature of her abilities themselves story ... its been done before to death so many times. <br/><br/>It got a bit draggy and I actually got up to go to the toilet during the movie... I NEVER do that in the Cinema.. and when I got back to my seat I did not miss anything<br/><br/>The huge leap between Diana not knowing her true abilities and then jumping up a high tower or running in front of the German machine guns was kinda laughable there was no middle ground or ""oh actually I AM the daughter or Zeus, hey this is what I can do!!""<br/><br/>The good: The actions scenes were great the humour was OK and the characters were OK the CGI was good<br/><br/>I am a fan but these things have to be said<br/><br/>I am looking forward to the Justice League - I think Wonder Women will be great again in that movie ...as she was in Batman vs Superman"

","I thought this was good movie and with a few changes could have been great. I thought the casting (besides the villains) was perfect espies Gal Gaddot. She was perfectly casted and loved her naivety and how she discovered the world was not so black and white. I also loved the backdrop of World War One. The downfalls of this movie was the villains, overuse of cgi, and the final act. I wish they would have tried to stick with a villain that was a real person not an enhanced human and a god. The cgi in some places was bad and wasn't even necessary. Especially the battle at the end was boring and they had so many good practical shots earlier in the movie why did they would pollute the final battle with so much garbage cgi? All in all a good movie but it hurts when you know it could have been a great one."

"avik-basu1889","7","2","11","7 November 2017"," First genuinely solid film in the DCEU !!!
","Let me state the things that I liked first:<br/><br/>1. Although the film uses tropes and conventions that come with the territory of superhero films, it still manages to make them feel fresh, funny and enjoyable especially because much of the film involves Diana becoming accustomed and familiar with the world of human beings which is highly different to her world which belongs to Amazonian Gods. The fish out of water element of the narrative helps in downplaying the standards tropes and freshening them up.<br/><br/>2. The film has a very refreshing humanistic soul. Just like the protagonist, the film exudes an innocent sense of optimism and belief that is genuinely moving.<br/><br/>3. One has to admire what it stands for and what it will do in terms of inspiring countless young girls(and boys) and stand as an example to show that a female led big budget superhero film won't always be an 'Elektra' or a 'Catwoman'.<br/><br/>4. The DC cinematic universe, as is clear by now, will continue to deal with stuff like gods, myths, legends, etc. But thankfully unlike 'Batman v Superman' where there was a constant attempt to make a silly, convoluted fight between two gorillas wearing circus costumes seem Biblical, profound and 'important' with Lex Luthor constantly spouting pretentious, pseudo-intellectual gibberish revolving around theology, 'Wonder Woman' at least decides to have fun with this stuff by subverting these elements for the most part.<br/><br/>5. Director Patty Jenkins clearly has an eye for visuals that have a flair to them. There are so many shots and sequences in the film that are rich with energy and personality. She makes use of Gal Gadot's physicality to give us a superhero who genuinely looks distinctive and enigmatic. The No Man's Land sequence is a great example of bravura filmmaking.<br/><br/>6. Gal Gadot isn't giving the deepest, most complicated performance ever, but Jenkins plays to Gadot's strengths and managed to make her look as good as possible and the very aspect of the Amazonians being somewhat literal organisms ends up making Gal Gadot's stiffness in many scenes along with her somewhat one dimensional line delivery seem understandable and maybe even warranted. Chris Pine is really good and his chemistry with Gal Gadot is one of the strongest things in the film.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the things that I didn't like: <br/><br/>1. The CGI isn't very good or convincing in many scenes. There are extended sequences where the green screens become easily discernible from a visual standpoint.<br/><br/>2. Patty Jenkins unfortunately resorts to the Zack Snyder school of slow motion abuse constantly during the action scenes. I have always felt that overusing slow motion during combat sequences only lessens the impact and appeal of these scenes.<br/><br/>3. The reveal when it comes to the real villain can be seen coming from a distance. It just lacks the impact and surprise that it aspires to achieve.<br/><br/>4. The majority of the final act disappointingly reverts back to a live-action video game spectacle just like 'Man of Steel' did in its final act. This prolonged badly choreographed CGI fest which the film ends with somewhat betrays all the good work that preceded it.<br/><br/>'Wonder Woman' is flawed, but it's still a good, inspirational and enjoyable film with a good heart. I like the fact that it did unexpectedly well at the box-office because of everything that it stands for. It's not the greatest film you'll ever see, but compared to the previous outings in the DCEU like the disappointing 'Man of Steel', the pretentious and bloated 'Batman v Superman' and the laughable mess 'Suicide Squad', 'Wonder Woman' feels like a much needed breath of fresh air."
"realmuthaf","4","2","11","25 June 2017"," Weak Woman
","The most critically acclaimed movie in the DCEU so far, seriously? In fact, this movie is the most unimaginative and the weakest entry in the franchise so far.<br/><br/>There are two good things about the movie really, and those are the leads. First, Gal Gadot is drop-dead gorgeous, this cannot be denied. He acting can be sub-par at times, but overall she plays her part well. Second, Chris Pine is still a charismatic dude who, also being a primary protagonist, delivers his performance well enough and has some of the better comedic moments.<br/><br/>But the problem is, that's about it! The action in the movie goes from mediocre to outright messy, with overabundance of CGI and shaky editing. The CGI in general often looks visibly cheap. The sidekick characters are clichÃ© (the only thing that Scotsman lacked was a bagpipe) or cringy (the plump woman, but thank God that's not Melissa McCarthy). The villain is just pathetic, with the cringiest lines imaginable, stereotypical lines like ""Join me or die"" and tedious lecturing on the morality of man. Compared to somebody like Zod from Man of Steel it's just unacceptable. The ""humor"" here is often out of place with the overall serious war tone of the movie, and goes from the passable ""Diana says some ridiculous stuff about Greek Gods while Steve looks skeptical"" to the unbearably ludicrous ""Oh look they talk about sex in a very uncomfortable way"". The plot is just bland and overused, as are most of the dialogues, especially in Themyscira (""You must not go, Diana. Okay, go Diana."") Oh, and our wannabe- pacifist-serial-killer heroine defeats the big baddie using ""the power of love"", amazing.<br/><br/>So yeah, there is almost nothing to love in this movie, the fact that the critics praised it just shows how hypocritical they are, the main reason for this is the fact that it's female-directed and female-led, which are not important factors when rating a movie in my book. My last hope in the DCEU is the Justice League and I sincerely hope that Weadon will not screw up Snyder's vision in it."

","I noticed a lot of the really bad reviews were from men who don't like female superheroes. Enough said on that.<br/><br/>I was hoping this would be a 10 star review but alas, the movie has what I consider flaws and unfortunately they are glaring to me.Wonder Woman with Gal Gadot does have it all..action,plot,cinematography and great acting. But there is too much emphasis on the war(think the latest Godzilla movie) and Diana doesn't strut her superhero stuff until over half way through the movie.I never read the comics so maybe it is accurate..the war..and the *eyeroll* romance. But Gadot and Pine lacked strong chemistry.<br/><br/>I loved the over the top action when WonderWoman finally takes off....but yes the CGI was at times disappointing..I'd fire whoever was in charge of it.This was too important a movie for such mistakes. <br/><br/>Overall,I give it 7 stars , I'd watch it again but it wasn't what I was hoping for.I REALLY hope the sequel learns from the mistakes in this movie.Gal Godot definitely IS Wonder Woman..no doubt in my mind.But i expect more next time."
"M_Exchange","8","2","11","1 June 2017"," Gal Gadot IS Wonder Woman
","I got somewhat emotional as I drove home from the theater because I know that Zack Snyder, who is going through a family crisis with the suicide of his daughter and who suffered a lot of criticism for casting Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, absolutely nailed it.<br/><br/>He knew what he was doing when he cast a stunningly gorgeous woman who was in the Israeli army. Who else who looks like Gadot could pull off the battle sequences so convincingly? It would seem absolutely moronic if he cast a sheltered beauty queen from America-- before this movie was released, many of his critics wanted him to use a busty, curvy American model instead of her.<br/><br/>Gal IS Wonder Woman. With all due respect (and the respect is well deserved) to Lynda Carter, she owns that tiara now. I can't imagine that they will ever find a more perfect actress for the part when Gal hangs it up.<br/><br/>Other than my adulation for Gal, I want to state as a World War I buff that director Patty Jenkins and her crew arranged the period pieces and the CG period pieces perfectly. I didn't see anything that struck me as out of place-- among the inanimate objects, anyway.<br/><br/>Maybe it would seem odd at the time that an American (Chris Pine's character) was working solely with British intelligence as a spy or-- especially more confounding-- that a native American just randomly joined the battle in Europe as some sort of rogue agent for hire. But we must use the same suspension of disbelief that we use when we accept that Wonder Woman is a princess from an enchanted island who must fulfill her prophecy of destroying a god of war.<br/><br/>Gadot's sensuous and intense facial expressions, her sweetness, her awesomeness in the role-- that's what I took from this movie even when the story went off the rails sometimes.<br/><br/>Henry Cavill is probably the worst Superman ever in film or TV, Ben Affleck makes for a great Batman, and Gadot is incomparable as Wonder Woman. I'm looking forward to seeing how The Flash and Aquaman will play."

","not enough action. felt slow at times. too many unnecessary close ups and slow scenes of Wonder Woman just standing there. had too much drama or was trying to be deep when it was not necessary. last 20 minutes was all flying around and magic fighting. so in short thats about it. on the plus side, it was emotional and pleasant at times<br/><br/>but in superhero film drama should not dominate the film but action should. thats the mistake DC makes over and over again. they are mainly interested in drama and not interested in details like why character has this ability or that ability. these abilities are there to elicit emotion in you. and thats just obvious and feels manipulative<br/><br/>i'll try to describe main problem that i didn't like about this film: so problem is that its okay to suspend one belief but after that, no additional suspensions should be needed. for example when we do in case of Marvel films. there are infinity stones that give users this specific abilities. after that everything follows from that. no other physics law is broken. even Thor who is flying, is doing so by creating air flows. here in this film, its not known what characters can and cant do. they are shooting beams and lightnings out of fingers and randomly manipulating and creating matter out of nothing. that just feels like magic and fantasy instead of science fiction"

","What is it with DC and their movie franchise, do they just not really care about their properties and just feel like they have do something because Marvel is?
Wonder Woman is a serviceable enough introduction to the character with an origin story attached. For those who have read the comics will know, Diana has been through many a change in her origin telling so just add this to the list.
I love my comics but the movies (I'm aiming this at ALL superhero movies not just DC's) as entertaining as they can be just don't fill me with the same joy, hence me only just getting round to watching this as the next sequel rolls around. The problem is the pacing and timing, I was flagging around the half way mark and could have done with a few more edits here and there to make it more digestable for a one sitting view.
The best I can say is, I didn't hate it !!"
"ssnake_z","7","1","4","1 September 2019"," Tripped at the finish line
","WONDER WOMAN
RATING: 3.4/5<br/><br/>Well i have to say, Gal Gadot really owned the role of Wonder Woman. She did a great job and i think the character is totally safe in her capable hands. This movie had a really solid, arguably great, start. Finding out about the Amazons and their warrior origins, was super interesting to me. The 2nd Act, shifting over to the World War 1 stuff, was pretty good and i actually wish they did more with that, but somewhere along the way, you could just feel the suits in Hollywood get involved. The 3rd Act literally devolved into nothing but excessively bad CGI and explosions. It was kind of sad to see because the movie was on its way to being great before getting totally derailed.<br/><br/>The quiet moments in this movie, where the characters were allowed to just breathe and be themselves, is where this movie shined IMO. Chris Pine did a solid job as Steve Trevor, definitely well cast, you could feel both characters struggle trying to work with and understand each other, coming from different worlds. The villains weren't built up very well, and that normally wouldn't be that big a deal, except the way they were used at the end, meant that they needed to be fleshed out more for it to really resonate with the audience the way it was supposed to.<br/><br/>The movie is by no means bad, it's just painfully okay, you could even argue good and that would be totally fine, but the fact that it was headed toward being great, is what's really getting under my skin here. I feel like this movie was just outright robbed of how great it could have been, and that's a crying shame... guess i can find solace in owning the animated Wonder Woman blu ray, that one's pretty great ^_^"
"cherold","8","1","4","29 August 2019"," solid superhero flick
","While not quite the be-all end-all some friends and critics lead me to expect, Wonder Woman is a first rate, character-driven action movie with a terrific performance by Gail Gadot, who previously supplied the only enjoyable moments of Superman vs. Batman.<br/><br/>Action scenes are exciting and fun, although director Jenkins is perhaps a bit too fond of that trick where you slow down the action for effect; it doesn't have to be done for *every* *move*.<br/><br/>I heard a few people say that the film really captures how super-women would fight, but this really shows more how Cirque du Soleil performers would fight. It's basic martial arts fighting with a little more flexibility in the joints. It's very cool.<br/><br/>The movie works hard to create moments that look to come out of a comic book, like a strikingly iconic moment of WW walking towards the camera or, in the film's best scene, her crouched behind her shield against a bullet barrage.<br/><br/>While some superhero movies are just noisy action sequences strung together by a skeleton plot and cartoon characters (such as the overrated Avengers), Wonder Woman takes its story seriously, with WW's idealism butting up against humanity's awfulness.<br/><br/>For a movie set in WWI there isn't really that much period flavor. There is, however, a terrific sense of WW's otherness in a world where women are not taken seriously.<br/><br/>Overall one of the better superhero movies, and well worth watching."

Wonder Woman is not a well written character. She's way to perfect and over powered. The writers were more concerned about writing a strong female lead than actually writing a good character with interesting conflict. I've been told by some of my female friends that I just don't get it. This is false. I can appreciate why woman and young girls enjoy the film while still realizing that it's not flawless. I just wish more people could do the same. It doesn't matter what gender your main character is. They must be interesting. Wonder Woman is not interesting.

"Leofwine_draca","6","1","4","21 December 2017"," Origin story benefits from a WW1 backdrop
","Another day, another superhero origin story, this time from the DC Comic stable. What I appreciated about WONDER WOMAN is the WW1 era setting, which gives for a fresher and more unusual tone than the typical contemporary superhero action. The little-known Israeli actress Gal Gadot acquits herself well as the fiery Amazon who goes gunning for the god Aries during the First World War, taking her anger out on some dastardly Germans at the same time. Chris Pine plays her spy ally and eventual love interest, but there's little time for character work in a film dominated by CGI-assisted action. Generally the fights are well staged, but I thought the 'superpower' FX were quite ludicrous - the scenes of Gadot performing superhuman leaps and the like look crazily bad. However, the amount of explosive mayhem taking place on screen is quite impressive, and the slug-fest climax works for once. The solid supporting cast includes another baddie turn for the reliably hissable Danny Huston, alongside the stuffy David Thewlis, the funny Ewen Bremner, and the unrecognisable Lucy Davis, best known for her role as Dawn in THE OFFICE all those years ago."
"neazy","6","1","4","30 November 2017"," A step in the right direction
","The one genuinely epic moment from the trainwreck that was Batman-v- Superman was the emergence of Wonder Woman in the final battle, accompanied by that gut-shivering signature riff. Such moments of brilliance are the signature of Wonder Woman's own film, and allied to touches of high drama, perfect delivery of comic lines, and slick action, there is much to enjoy. But somehow, despite all this, the film feels as though there are just as many points where it misses the mark. It's sense of time is this film's weakest point. On a macro scale, it felt, curiously, both over-long for its actual content, and too short to fully explain it's own story. This is demonstrated best by the painting-by-numbers opening segment which feels both too long to be an effectively punchy setup to the main narrative, and too short to fully engage with - or, worryingly, care about) its characters, and to add real dramatic tension to the parts of its plot which carry over into the rest of the film. This is yet another consequence of DC's corner-cutting approach in attempting to catch its cinematic universe up with its rivals - an origin story and a link in to the modern world in which the character has already been situated by B-v-S are crammed into one film, with neither given enough weight. Whilst it is limiting to rate DC films simply by comparison with Marvel, they need to earn the right to be taken on their own merits. I found myself comparing it with Captain America: The First Avenger, a film which, whilst not extraordinary, was a solid and effective setup for the character of Steve Rogers. By the time Winter Soldier comes about, Cap is a fully fledged character - we know his motivations, history, personality, etc., and therefore can concentrate on a more complex and interesting story than was offered in the first film. Wonder Woman tries to do all of this in one go, and the result is confused. The other useful parallel with Captain America is between Steve Rogers' band of soldiers, and Steve Trevor's in Wonder woman. Because Rogers is the centre of the story, it doesn't matter that the members of his crew were fairly forgettable - they were simply foils to their leader, and that worked. Wonder Woman seems to want more than this for Trevor's gang, giving them extra back story, and more independent screen time. The trouble is that because Trevor is - quite rightly, effectively, and often refreshingly willingly - a secondary figure himself, we have very little reason to care about his cronies, and they serve more as slightly irritating distraction than anything else.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment, however, is the clumsy way in which the brilliant moments of the film are knitted together. Too many promising comic and dramatic setups are spoiled by muddled storytelling or clunky bits of dialogue. This is summed up, somewhat ironically, by the signature riff itself. Instead of its expected appearance as Wonder Woman goes 'over the top' into no-man's land - a superb transition between her 'civilised' state and her true warrior form, it is missing until several minutes later, during a mid-action fight with a room- full of soldiers. At this point, the action has been at its height for so long that the riff loses its dramatic edge.<br/><br/>But despite these fairly comprehensive criticisms, there is one thing which cannot be faulted, and that is Gal Gadot's performance as the eponymous heroine. She is captivating, charming, utterly believable, constantly engaging, and absolutely feels and looks the part, even when struggling against the clunkier moments of script and story. I found myself genuinely invested in her as a character, beyond simply taking a ride through the story. Significantly, this film also demonstrates the potential of a female lead in a superhero film to great effect, and deals with this new dynamic with slick and often very funny efficiency. The chemistry between Gadot and Pine is excellent, and allows this quite fundamental point to prove its efficacy on its own merit, without artificial stimulus.<br/><br/>Whilst I'm not sure this film has much rewatch value - it isn't coherent or layered enough to demand a second viewing, and the ending is unsatisfying - it makes me want to see more of Wonder Woman. Of more general importance is that it restores some faith in DC's cinematic universe. This is a flawed film, but it shows the studio to be heading, we hope, in the right direction."

","I love Wonder Woman. She's definitely one of my favorite superheroes of all time, right beside Batman, Spiderman, The Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool. But in the case of her movie....it's basically rinse and repeat of every other DC superhero movie ever made, right down to the superhero landing, the epic one-on-one battle with everything blowing up and swords clashing and stuff.<br/><br/>In terms of how accurate it is to the original comics, it gets a lot of things right but a few things wrong. For example, Diana becomes Wonder Woman only after winning the amazon games, Steve Trevor brings Diana to America, not London, and she appears in World War II and not the first world war.<br/><br/>So did I like it? No, I didn't. I wanted to, but I couldn't bring myself to like it. Everything's rinse and repeat from the last DC films, and it doesn't have the humorous approach that marvel movies have taken in the last few years (Deadpool, Guardians 2, and Avengers; Age of Ultron) But that's the thing. It really depends whether you want ""comic"" book heroes or Comic book ""heroes."" I don't think it's a bad movie, but I didn't like it. It's exactly like every other DC superhero film i've seen, except in this case, the protagonist has boobs.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and Lynda Carter and Lyle Waggoner didn't cameo in this film. Finally! Not that I wouldn't love to see Lynda in a movie...But the cameo thing has been done to death in recent years."
"tulifitzroy","7","1","4","23 June 2017"," Two Steps Forward, One Step Back
","Wonder Woman has received a lot of praise since hitting box offices and rightly so. After so many flops, DC managed to produce a film with enough hits to satisfy critics and rouse fans. Wonder Woman does a lot of things better than its predecessors, chief among which is the representation of women. Diana is a complicated character - naive, strong, bullheaded, vulnerable, etc. - Multifaceted and sometime contradictory, like most women, and more importantly, like most human beings. None of her characteristics is derived or derided by the presence of the male characters in her story line - she is what she is, because that is what makes her, her - an individual. There are many other commendable choices this film made, such as the inclusion of the ""personal wars,"" female characters over the age of 35, as well as the grey and moral dubiousness of all sides engaged in a war.<br/><br/>However, for all the successes, the film is still plagued by the same problems previous DC films have faced, most of which originate in the plot or lack thereof. While the struggles of characters of color as well as the dubious morality of the ""heroes"" of a war are hinted at, these issues are never explored. While I understand this is tough to do, even in a bloated run time of 2 hours and 21 minutes, even Diana's, the titular character's, plot line is never fully developed. Reading more like an exposition, the movie sports a flaccid story that is hastily wrapped up in the last half hour in the most laughably weak way possible. Make no mistake, I thoroughly enjoyed the first three quarters of the movie - the acting was decent, the action scenes were inspiring (excessively twirling Amazons notwithstanding), and the humor relevant. However, to sum up the whole of Diana's journey from the well-meaning and strong ingÃ©nue to the disillusioned warrior princess to the champion of human kind as the result of a brief sexual encounter with a blonde haired, blue eyed ""above average"" male character who said he loved her is insulting. It smacks of the backward ideas that all a girl needs to become a woman is ""the love of a man."" If Diana was male, this ending would still be irritating, but as a female character, it is downright insulting as it trivializes the whole of a female character's motivations, once more, to relying on the male characters. I want to make it clear that this is not the same trope of a loved-one dying to motivate a character for action. In Wonder Woman, as Diana is struggling to find the parts of humanity worth saving, she ignores all the other decent and inspiring parts of humanity (a mother's love for child, the friendship between Sameer, Charlie and Chief, the willingness of Steve Trevor to die so others will not, etc.) and instead finds the inspiration to continue to champion humanity from a one night stand. This is inherently problematic as it is essentially saying that the love of a man is what makes humanity worth saving, not say, the thousands of other beautiful things in human potential. Even if the movie was going for a ""Love saves everything"" kind of feel (and they so, so where - I mean the end credit song as Sia's ""To be Human...is to Love""), they could have done it in a better way. <br/><br/>In sum: DC needs to hire new script writers. Badly. That said, if you can suspend your mind for about two and half hours, its not a bad way to fritter away the time."
"NDbportmanfan","7","1","4","5 June 2017"," I Came Away Satisfied With the Movie, but Wasn't Impressed
","Let it be known that I am a sucker for these superhero movies. If there is one that is going to come out soon; you better believe I already know about it. I usually walk away enjoying them very much (giving the scores 7, 8 or 9 on a regular basis). Now I am not saying it is a bad movie as you can tell by the 7 stars listed above. It is just getting more praise than it really deserves.<br/><br/>When I first heard about the plan for the movie; I thought well it is going to take place in World War I, Steve Trevor is going to be involved, and Wonder Woman will have to stop the Germans. This sounds familiar but as I watched, the films felt relatively more and more similar. The other movie I am talking about is Captain America the First Avenger. Now this is a non spoiler review so I can't give details in why I think these two are so similar but a lot of big plot points remind me of the Cap movie. Currently WW is sitting at an 8.4 and with this many votes I can't see it going below a 7.4, and with Cap at a surprising 6.9 it leaves me scratching my head as both were good.<br/><br/>Now with that point out of the way, I will say this movie did something very well. Presenting a very nice relationship between Steve and Diana. Steve and Peggy were my top duo but I think how there characters in Wonder Woman were written Steve and Diana take first in the chemistry department. Pine's great comedic one liners along with the compassion and kindness he showed Diana really made him a likable character (and to top it off he is Chris Pine). The other thing that made the movie was the villain reveal. It was a refreshing way to thrown the character out there and it was really awesome.<br/><br/>The bad besides the for-mentioned similar-esque story. The Dr. Poison character really was wasted. She was given just terrible lines of dialogue. That was the cringe in the movie, just clichÃ© villain talk. A problem that probably just bugs me but the needless comedy in the movie. MCU does this on a regular basis and it is beginning to annoy me now and I don't want DC to use it. I enjoy the gloom and DC should stick with it, there doesn't need to be scenes just for the laugh as there are some here.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a good movie but it is not some sub-genre defining movie. If you are someone who does not go out of there way to watch superhero movies; I think it is okay to wait for this to be released on Blu-ray or whatever your preference.<br/><br/>I will say 7.2/10"

","IMDb: 8.5, and Rotten Tomatoes: 93% (atm). Well, I think these ratings are slightly overrated. ðŸ¤”<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is indeed a good movie but definitely not the best of DC yet (though TDK was not part of DCEU, it still holds the best DC movie title till date).<br/><br/>I'd give Wonder Woman ~7.0.<br/><br/>I can see all the hard work what Gal Gadot (as an actor), and Patty Jenkins (as a director) have put in this movie, and this might be the best of their works too. But still, at some points I felt that Gal has put too much efforts (in a few scenes only) and ended up doing overacting (not as overacted as Jesse Heisenberg (Lex Luthor), and Jared Leto (The Joker) though). Also, her charm and cuteness don't translate into the Wonder Woman's character.<br/><br/>Good parts:<br/><br/><ul><li>DCEU has had too much pressure to make this movie bright and witty (some jokes have landed so well to be honest) in order to attract all genre of audiences.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Although the plot was very generic, Patty and Matthew Jensen (cinematographer) have shaped it really well.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Chris Pine (Steve Trevor) has done a great job, and thank god they didn't stretch their romance too far.</li></ul><br/><br/>Bad parts:<br/><br/><ul><li>All the action scenes in the trailers - that's all; no additional action scenes in the actual movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>CGI &amp; special effects - again, this is the part where DCEU seriously needs to work on.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Just like Suicide Squad (and any other Marvel movies), this movie suffers with the super-villain syndrome too.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Danny Huston (Ludendorff) has done an awful acting, and putting Ares - The God of War was somehow out of the shape for the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>And last but the most important part - it was loud, but the background score did not leave any effect on the movie (it's missing the magical touch of Hans Zimmer).</li></ul><br/><br/>So overall, it's an above average superhero movie which has successfully managed to save the sinking boat of DCEU.

"SAMTHEBESTEST","7","2","13","2 June 2017"," Fulfills Normal Expectations but Slightly disappoints that High Expectations level.
","WONDER WOMAN REVIEW - Sometimes you expect less from a film and then you read some extremely positive reviews and starts expecting higher than your normal expectations and then even a Good film looks average. This is what exactly happened to me with Wonder Woman, i don't call it an average affair, it was a very good film and fulfilled those normal expectations but somewhere fell inches short to that high expectations level. Let me talk about every individual field :- Acting - Gal Gadot is Fantastic as Wonder Woman, but believe me she looks damn hot and distracts your attention from Acting. I think the whole idea was to make her look attracting and distract people from 'An Actor Gal Gadot'. Other star cast got nothing big and noticeable to do but they all were fairly good.<br/><br/>Writing - We have seen WW's glimpse in BvS so when you visit her earlier life there has to be something satisfying reason and there is some great writing to set a plot to the glory of First Lady Superhero. Some logical mistakes are there but let it be.<br/><br/>VFX and Action - Action sequences are brilliant, much better in slow motion. VFX work is good but 3D effects aren't up to the mark. Just for 5-6 minutes 3D effects scenes you have to wear irritating glasses for 2 hours.<br/><br/>Cinematography - Good but nothing new. Few vertical and horizontal angles lefts an impression.<br/><br/>Background Music - Excellent ! In Fight sequences Background score lifts the tempo up to the next level. And it's suitable for the Era shown in film.<br/><br/>Direction - Thank god Zack Snyder wasn't director here, he disappointed with BvS so choosing Patty Jenskine has worked for DCEU. I can say she has given the Best film so far to DCEU. And i think choosing a woman director for a lady superhero film gave it some boost.<br/><br/>Final Words - Overall Wonder Woman is not a Must Watch film but it is not a film to miss either. It completes normal expectations but slightly disappoints High Expectations, now it's up to you what you are expecting from a film. I'm giving 7/10* and i think this film will surpass everyone's expectation as a viewer and on Box Office too."
"jaywensley2004","7","2","13","1 June 2017"," If you're going to rip-off other movies, you better have an actress as right for the role as Gal Godot
","I know that mine is going to be an unpopular opinion, but...<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" is not a great movie.<br/><br/>Gal Godot, however, is a great actress in the role.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" cribs from many other movies. I saw fight sequences that were evocative of the ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"" films, heard dialogue that could have been lifted from ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Age of Ultron."" The first 20 minutes of ""Wonder Woman"" brought to mind the teen film ""Percy Jackson: The Lightening Thief."" And the overall visual sensibility suggests Director Patty Jenkins was taking her direction from Zack Snyder, giving the movie the look of Snyder's own ""Sucker Punch.""<br/><br/>But Gal Godot radiates charisma. She is worth every dollar of the admission price, every minute spent watching ""Wonder Woman."" It is her performance that elevates the movie from blatant rip-off to credible homage. Gal Godot projects honesty, integrity and likability the equal of Tom Cruise or Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson at their best. She moves from innocent bemusement to fearsome obsession, from a fish out of water to the baddest shark in the ocean with such believability that I am stung the movie around her is not up to her performance. <br/><br/>DC gets lucky with ""Wonder Woman."" They hung the future of their movie universe on possibly the only actress who could carry that load. <br/><br/>As a bonus, there is also the Wonder Woman theme; something about this song feels primal. It may be my favorite theme from any movie, ever.<br/><br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw_o7XUX3fg"
"elmerflp","3","2","14","5 June 2017"," A letdown for two reasons
","This was an entertaining movie, but I don't think I would recommend it to anyone else, for two reasons. First, the issue of Wonder Woman's powers is very confusing and inconsistent. In this movie, she seemingly starts out as just another Amazonian chick, but ends up flying through the air like Superman. This seems to follow a pattern in her previous comic book and TV incarnations. In some cases, she had to have the glass (invisible) plane to fly, but at other times she could fly alone, like Superman. Secondly, I was disappointed to learn that Wonder Woman's creator, William Moulton Marston, was a seedy, loathsome character (see Wikipedia for the details on his menage a trois and fondness for eugenicist Margaret Sanger). Hopefully this excellent actress, Gal Gadot, will find a better vehicle for her talents in the future."

","TLDR: This is a fun, quintessential superhero movie with an incredibly charismatic female heroine at the heart of it. It's not perfect, but it's still an important film. A must watch!<br/><br/>I can't even deal with all the superhero movies coming out these days. Film after film with generic white males dressed in tights starts to get boring and unappealing. Enter Wonder Woman -- Gal Gadot is resplendent as the Amazon woman turned heroine who is both a bad ass and an empathetic human being at the same time. It's so important to show characters like this, with women and people in underrepresented groups at the center. Aside from all that, the movie itself is fun! It's tightly paced and action packed from start to finish. The villain is a bit silly and some of the mystic elements are eye roll inducing. But generally, it's a solid and fun romp which is what super hero movies should be! <br/><br/>Watch it and make sure the young women in your life see it. After seeing this movie, my 7 year old niece said: I didn't know a girl could be so strong? It made me tear up to know that she never thought it was possible. I'm glad this film was made."

Y-E-S! is not a bad dream at all....But well, seriously speaking: He was the only reason I went to see this movie, I'm not a big fan of the adaptations of superhero comics, because they are so popular and so box-office box office that they are boring! In spite of everything I gave him the benefit of the doubt and in the end I liked him so much, without expecting anything in return, David is undoubtedly the surprise of this film, interpreting two characters: on the one hand we have Sir Patrick a nobleman who at first sight only seeks to end peacefully with the First World War and on the other hand we discover that in truth it is Ares, the god of war who will do everything possible to end with the protagonist: Diana (i.e. Wonder Woman), daring to play a typical character and wanting to contrast with a very different character and not stay in his comfort zone made me happy, I was literally impacted in the cinema like the rest of the people there. The final battle with Ares and Diana reminds me of the last minutes of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice but 1000 times better! Wonder Woman is so easy to see that the 141 minutes it lasts blow as fast as the wind.<br/><br/>Cons: Although the film lasts more than 2.5 hours, I think in that time more moments could have been shown than if they should have been included in the film to give more shape to the story such as Diana's childhood or more interaction between her and the rest of the cast. The ""relationship"" they want to sell about Diana and Trevor is unbelievable, FXs are sometimes very exaggerated and so boring to watch.... But hey, it's a superhero movie, what else can you expect? This film is safe and doesn't take many risks.<br/><br/>Curious fact: David Thewlis and Ewen Bremmer appeared together before in Naked."

","'Wonder Woman' is a stylish, epic success for DC Extended Universe. Although I tend to steer clear of superhero movies of any kind, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and am very much looking forward to see what the DCEU has to offer next. While the first 20 minutes of the film seem offbeat and quite forced with cliches, the film quickly picks itself up as the plot progresses, and being a length of two hours and twenty minutes, the flawed beginning is quickly forgotten by the reaming two hours which is nothing short of wonderful. Gal Gadot owns the role of 'Wonder Woman' and was definitely a smart casting choice, however it's really Chris Pine who steals the movie for me. However, it's the evident chemistry between the two leading actors that contribute to the greatness of this film. The other characters in the film are all great too, particularly the psychotically evil Doctor Poison. The fight scenes are nothing short of epic and are handled really well by director Patty Jenkins, despite some scenes having a little too much of CGI. It's movies like 'Wonder Woman' that are meant to be watched with great surround sound and a high-definition television in order to enjoy the film to it's greatest extent."

As a symbol of equality, power, and truth, her natural confidence and unmistakable intelligence made her unequaled.Wonder Woman's origin story relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother Queen Hippolyta and given life by Aphrodite, along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek gods
The Amazons are technologically advanced peaceful civilization. <br/><br/>The movie throws everything unique about Wonder Woman makes her a generic as possible. She is now the daughter of Zeus, the Bill Cosby of Greek Mythology. Amazons are stuck in 300BC because they are women and are not capable of inventing anything in 2000 years .She kills dozens of German soldiers like they are born Nazis. The movie most glaring problem is it's villains. They are generic bad guy with cringy dialogues. The main villain comes in the last 10 minutes of the movie ,says confusing things and unclear motives ,fights Diana in Bad CGI armor and is killed by Deus ex machina power.
The movie has a lot of plot holes like How a tiny boat reached from Turkey to London in four days , How Amazons know English and How does invisible barrier work. 
Wonder Woman stays hidden for 100 years until Batman sents an Email .
It is sad the DC changed so many things about Wonder Woman and made her generic while Marvel proudly embraced it in Black Panther.

","While I love a good superhero movie it is obvious that females are under represented in this entire genre. Yet, with the introduction of Wonder Woman it appears that this issue has been swept under the rug. Don't get me wrong from the perspective of someone on the outside this movie is generally pretty good. It has the action and it presents the backstory and makes the viewer leave wanting more. But, throughout all this it also has a woman represented as strong and powerful, the central theme to her own story. Contrary to this the woman is being overly sexualized wearing a leotard and really it is quite pointless. I mean think about this movie during filming Gal Gadot was pregnant and doing her own stunts for crying out loud. Yet for some reason they edited her to be just about the smallest little waist you can imagine. This is not needed to further the story-line and in my mind is the opposite of empowering. The movies plot is driven by a man and the movie itself it the ideal unobtainable reality. The movie does very little to empower real women. It rather reinforces these unobtainable hypersexualized ideals often found not only in super hero movies but throughout Hollywood."

The acting is really bad and the characters reactions to about everything that pops up are never credible. The effects that I mentioned being sometimes inspiring are equally bad, as if the effort is only reserved to a few scenes. The decisions and conclusions that the characters made are not built up enough and it feels like they come out of the air. The dialogue is so bad it hurt sometimes and scenes that are supposed to be serious become laughable, take this for example (occurs at about 3 minutes in setting the tone for the depth in the dialogue):<br/><br/>Woman 1: ""Looks very good""

The last words of the movie left me face palming hard, since Diana is speaking to us like a schoolgirl would.
It's not a really bad movie either - the effects are great except for when the film is not trying to impress us too much.

The most disappointing thing is how they warped Wonder Woman's well known pacifist nature to one of a generic thug. Hit first, ask questions later, violence is always the answer.

But I see my fellow Users have beat me to it. Excellent. It is good to see that many in the IMDb base share such good taste. Then why on earth are these overpaid Hollywood geniuses making the movie while these intelligent, sensitive viewers are not? 
I do not blame the actors or any who demonstrated decent artistry in their specialties. I mean to include the designers and to some extent the musicians among those who deserve credit, but they have seen their work co-opted and exploited by the producers and a pass-through director and script writers. These latter have taken their cut or salaries under the false pretenses of providing a fresh vision. 
The dialog. Even when the dialog aspires to match an epic tone with the mythic origin story it fails to inspire. When it is just people talking, it might as well be nods and grunts for all the humor and romance it wants to convey. Despite IMDb's category, there is nothing truly quotable to be scraped from this sound track.
The plot. Twist? What twist? The predicable nature of this kind of epic demands there be one or more twists - if only to justify why the story plods along within time-worn ruts. Sure, we'll put up with battle scenes turning against our heroine so long as she finds a clever, clever way to get out from her foe's evil clutches. But Nope, nothing clever here. She just gets madder. 
When he gets bigger, she gets stronger. 
Brilliant.
The characters. Who cares? Did any viewer ever worry about anyone? We knew WW would have the skills and strength to get out of any predicament. We knew that love would be interrupted, as it always is in any attempt at a love sub-plot. Depth was barely skin deep.
The ethnic diversity was a fine attempt to --? Well, to what end I'm not sure. Probably to avoid being lumped by PC critics with all the other movies that don't have ""ethnic diversity."" Boring.<br/><br/>The crime. The great sin here is the enormous budget being wasted. The film *looks* great, and I feasted my eyes on the period uniforms and settings and on the fine equestrian scenes with female archers, etc etc. I guess from a business perspective this was a fine investment. The high viewer rating suggests that there was a reasonable degree of consumer satisfaction, so maybe future ticket sales by the same team has been assured.<br/><br/>But - silly of me to bring it up, I guess - where was the honest emotion? - the real camaraderie? the insight?
The art?"

","Following the release of Wonder Woman, DC had released three god awful films, these being: Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and Suicide Squad. Compared to these movies, Wonder Woman is a breath of fresh air. <br/><br/>Of course, taking previous movies into account, this isn't saying much.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is receiving high praise and sits at a generous 91% on Rotten Tomatoes. Many critics are giving this movie points for having a female director and lead. But looking at this film objectively, it is at best, a sub par summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>The action wasn't good. The directing was often confusing and seemed like it was being edited by a slightly experienced film student. The CGI was overused and straight-up bad, at some points. A lot of the fight scenes looked very animated and very out-of-place for a movie set in a tonally gritty and realistic WWI. A lot of the action scenes could've used more simple, better shot fight scenes with more practical effects, especially considering how seriously this movie liked to take itself at times.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot delivers a flat performance as Wonder Woman. She plays the role of 'fish out of water' quite well, but whenever a dramatic scene demands that she emote, her lackluster performance shows. Chris Pine is also in this movie and plays the role of the love interest. Romantic scenes involving him and Gal feel genuine and are probably the best part of this suck-fest. <br/><br/>The troop of misfits that they take to war with them is composed of probably the worst actors in a blockbuster superhero film. Not much to say about them, quite honestly. They suck.<br/><br/>The villain of this movie is completely uninspired. Ares has no other motivation other than ""END HUMANITY!!!"", which is beating on the dead horse that all villains in every superhero movie ever just want to dominate/destroy the world. Nothing interesting there. The other villains are two Nazi scientists, Ludendorff and Doctor Poison (try to guess what her shtick is). Ludendorff is a German general who wants to make a poisonous gas with Dr. Poison. Dr. Poison also wants to make a poisonous gas.<br/><br/>That's it.<br/><br/>Apparently, these two villains were set up to show that humans aren't one way or the other, but are very complex, and that each villain has their own moral compass that justifies their evilness. Except, in the final act of this movie, the film completely destroys this point.<br/><br/>The final act of this movie is probably the worst and the biggest reason I didn't enjoy this movie. All throughout the movie, Chris Pine is trying to explain to Wonder Woman that humans aren't so one-dimensional, and that destroying Ares won't fix humanity. This is an interesting idea, one that a lot of superhero movies don't seem to fixate on. Killing a certain entity won't solve all the problems in the world. Humans are complex and do things for reasons other than ""some bad guy is making us do it"". I thought that this would've ended up being a learning experience for Wonder Woman and would've built her character, bringing her naivety down a peg. <br/><br/>But, no. <br/><br/>Killing. Ares. Ends. World. War. One.<br/><br/>And just like that, any sort of message or value this movie could have had is all cut down and destroyed in one swift motion. <br/><br/>*Sigh*"

No one is actually interesting or memorable for longer then 5 seconds in this movie. There isn't a single bit of interesting dialogue.

This is an average comic superhero movie where we see the roots of Wonder Woman, with it's perfect start, how-awful-things-are-when-a-superhero-tries-to-be-a-human moments and everything else. What makes it branch off and become something different - and better - is that we don't have a confident, know it all hero, more like a woman in the making, not mature but sure about her purpose and full of courage to do so.<br/><br/>One thing though, the special effects in this movie look really low budget and you may be surprised when you see them for the first time. This movie is a lot more than the action scenes, and you shouldn't really focus just on them, but I'm surprised to see they didn't go for a more impressive look. Also Wonder Woman goes from having zero knowledge of her abilities to be this super confident hero that looks like it's been saving the world for years. That progression should've been done better I think.<br/><br/>Something that makes this movie shine is how pure Wonder Woman is, and how everything around her shines. Her character is so honest and caring, follows her emotions and fights for her believes until the end. It's so good that she didn't ended up being this badass or funny type of superheroes we all know already, but still kept more than enough strength to not be a damsel in distress.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a good movie that could've been so much better, but has some things so nicely done that it's worth the watch."

","Wonder Woman is probably one of those movies to see twice to really enjoy it allbecause this first viewing of mine kinda left me with less than a wonderful feeling.<br/><br/>Right off, I am not a fan of slo-mo fight scenes and this movie has tons of them. When Diana (never aka Wonder Woman) is fighting in real time, it's pretty damn impressive and a ton of fun. But, there are those dang (movie) 300 shots of slo-mo that grinds my gears. <br/><br/>Next up, the writing felt clunky and directionless at times. The motivations and aim always seemed a tad off. Thisis one of those reasons that I believe it's worth at very least one more viewing now that I've seen the whole picture. And finally, when the action was on screen, sans the slo-mo, it was great but...the action was few and far between. For an over two-hour film, some scenes were tough to get through just to get to the action that certainly paid off.<br/><br/>That all said, I did enjoy the movie. Gal did fine as Wonder Woman, sorry, ""Diana"" and Chris Pine played his normal shtick – though, he did know his place. You could tell he respected, nicely, whose movie this was: Diana's.<br/><br/>Made from clay Diana is raised on (what used to be called ""Paradise Island,"" in my book, but in the movie) Themyscira and after what felt like 3 or so combat lessons, she meets WWI-spy Steve Trevor who crashes near her home. Steve brings some unwanted enemies and stories to convince Diana leave her only existence with Steve to stop the Great War for all mankind.<br/><br/>The effects, sound, comedy and epic scale all worked. What worked most was the heart of Diana. In one heartfelt/courageous scene in particular, I almost teared up as she was fed up with rules over helping others. <br/><br/>As stated, the movie's over two hours and occasionally feels longer, but it does feel like we just bit off the tip of her iceberg. I would want to see more. This is a prequel to her first on screen appearance in Batman v Superman, but like a hundred years in the past. Bring on some more adventures. Let's see her in WWII or some other cold war attacks. <br/><br/>Worth seeing. Nothing in it is strikingly bad. There's even a very nice nude scenewell, almost. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: 10 Best DC Movies, so far: <br/><br/>1. Superman: The Movie <br/><br/>2. Batman (1989) <br/><br/>3.

"TheVictoriousV","6","1","6","9 April 2020"," (ARCHIVE REVIEW) In anticipation of Wonder Woman 2
","I am just as astounded as you by all the praise directed toward Wonder Woman. I suppose it makes sense, since the bar for DC Universe installments has been set so impossibly low by Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, and the bar for female-led superhero films even lower by the likes of Elektra and Catwoman. Now we have a movie that (A) does well in both categories, (B) constitutes the first proper Wonder Woman feature, and (C) finally puts DC one step ahead of Marvel Studios in letting the ladies take the spotlight of a solo adventure.<br/><br/>In many ways, this is a film of triumph. It has given us hope that DC may yet have a chance to turn this ship away from the maelstrom, it has made female fans feel unusually satisfied (there was even a ""women only"" screening, which I would be far more miffed at if there didn't exist ""no girls allowed"" screenings of Logan), and it had a chance to opt for a more Xena-esque tone before it was too late and the only way out would have been tactless re-edits and randomly inserted pop songs.<br/><br/>Directed by Patty Jenkins and screenplay penned by Allen Heinberg (who recently worked on an unfinished Wonder Woman TV pilot), the film mainly takes place during World War I. Our heroine Diana (Gal Gadot), an Amazonian demigoddess and the child of Zeus and Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), saves an undercover US Air Service pilot named Steve (Chris Pine) who crashes near the hidden island where Diana's kin reigns - she hasn't met a man before, it turns out. The island, giving me Lefkada flashbacks, is my favorite design of the film; it is a pity we don't get to stay long.<br/><br/>As the Amazons learn of the Great War, as it was called, Diana realizes that war has returned to mankind and that she, despite warnings from her mother, must do that which her people were sent by the gods to do - restore peace. This bit of backstory is told earlier in the film to a young Diana, in a series of animated images that resemble moving Renaissance paintings.<br/><br/>We meet more characters. David Thewlis plays a benevolent Imperial War Cabinet speaker, Elena Anaya plays the Germans' aptly nicknamed head chemist ""Dr. Poison"", Robin Wright is an Amazon warrior who tutors Diana, Lucy Davies provides a bit of comic relief I could easily have done without, and Saïd Taghmaoui, Eugene Brave Rock, and Ewen Bremner make up the band of misfits that join Steve and Diana when the British military refuse to help.<br/><br/>The film does still have Snyderian dark moments, both in terms of imagery and themes, but it works better here as Diana makes an optimistic drop of color in a grey world. It is fitting, perhaps even timely, that her enemy isn't an evil alien or scheming billionaire, but a personification of war itself in the form of the Greek god Ares - thought to be in the human form of Germany's General Ludendorff (Danny Huston). She is the hero the DC Universe needed, and was denied when Superman was turned mopey and aggressive.<br/><br/>To be sure, Zack Snyder was still involved with the story but Heinberg evidently fine-tuned it to the point of comprehensibility and, dare I say, good quality. The film does feature some of Snyder's usual traits, such as the overused slow-motion and the brown-ish balls of fire that never look real, but I attribute this to the fact that Patty Jenkins still had to make the film fit it into the DC Extended Universe in some way.<br/><br/>I had other problems. There is a certain twist near the end (which seemed less out-of-the-blue to me than to my theater companions, but I did know it beforehand) that at first seems to give the film a challenging ending but ultimately goes for a more black-and-white conclusion. Also, as genuine as Wonder Woman is in simply giving female fans (in particular) the exhilarating comic-book action film they've craved, there are some less than subtle moments that could have been cut for time at the expense of nothing but a few easy ""amirite"" jokes. I can assure those in doubt: a scene where a superhuman single-handedly obliterates an army of soldiers isn't ""pandering"" just because a woman is doing it.<br/><br/>But the film is still very much that; an exhilarating action movie with exciting visuals, and characters you enjoy, admire, and root for. Gal Gadot plays her role much better than she did in Dawn of Justice and she certainly looks the part, even if some aficionados may wish she was taller and burlier. Chris Pine does well as a coward in badass' clothing and both leads are fun in their respective fish-out-of-water situations where they try to comprehend each other's cultures, even if much of it's been done.<br/><br/>I can absolutely see why women, including those ""of color"", would feel encouraged by the fact that an Israeli lead, a female director, an age-old role model, and a genuinely good, non-pandering script would take the summer movie season by such storm. It succeeds at being a crowd-pleasing comic-book adventure that nevertheless has a beautiful vision precisely because that vision is not supplied by Zack Snyder or edited beyond coherence, and it succeeds at being a progressive victory precisely because it's not a Sony film and the plot isn't ""what if Superman was a girl?"""
"Only_Honest_Review","6","1","6","24 March 2020"," Starts great then gets silly and dumb ending
","This movie starts great bringing the iconic heroine to the big screen with visceral action scenes and great fight choreography but then descends into a silly story about fighting a God shooting laser beams with ridiculous logic that makes no sense. Coming up with a good villain is hard and especially one with motivations that make sense. The first half is great but the ending is disappointing and I left the theatre with mixed feelings barely remembering what the story is about or who the villain is. It's an okay film but like most superhero films, it falls short of the mark without a worthy memorable adversary. That's the key to great superhero stories."
"LBarlane24","4","1","6","17 February 2020"," Best female-lead superhero movie my a*s
","Directed by Patty Jenkins, Wonder Woman stars Israeli model Gal Gadot as the titular character, along with Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, her love-interest. Let me start off by saying that I was incredibly underwhelmed the first time I saw this film. My second viewing was no better, and the third ... yeah.<br/><br/>One of my biggest gripes with the film is its tone. I don't know how, but it just felt uneven to me. It might have actually been because of the mostly cringy humor scattered throughout; mostly being the key word as there were some scenes that did get a few chuckles out of me.<br/><br/>Another huge gripe I had was the three supporting supposed characters: there's a Scotsman who is frequently described as a professional sniper, a French man who often flirts with the main heroine, and some Native-American dude who had absolutely no depth whatsoever; then again, the other two seemed to have virtually none either. All three of them were there simply to serve as plot-devices, as well as mostly comic-relief.<br/><br/>One other gripe that a lot of people seem to have is the villains. Yes, I will sincerely agree that they were cartoonish at bast, but I honestly could care less. But the main issue that I have with the film is none other than the star herself Gal Gadot. I still do not get why this woman has gotten so much praise. Besides being nice to look at, she had absolutely nothing of value to offer. Her acting was completely wooden as she gives only 2-3 facial expressions in the whole film. And her line delivery, beyond mediocre.<br/><br/>The only saving grace of the film was none other than Chris Pine. While far from perfect, he clearly gave it all his best.<br/><br/>I've said it before and I'll say it again, Captain Marvel is far superior to this movie. Hate me all you want, send me death threats for all I care, I am sticking by what I said, I liked Captain Marvel way more than this tripe."

"Coolaj56","4","1","6","11 March 2019"," A clumsy, ugly, disappointing mess
","(This review will have major spoilers.)
To start out with, Gal Gadot looks the part of a goddess very well, but her performance is mediocre at best. Chris Pine is serviceable with a few decent scenes. The only actually good performance is from Saïd Taghmaoui, who plays Sameer. His character does basically nothing, like all the secondary characters in this film, but he was at least entertaining to watch. There is sadly not a single character arc in this film, not even from the title character, which was disappointing to say the least.
The fish-out-water scenes in the middle of the movie are decent and have most of the good lines of the movie. Aside from that though, almost nothing here works. From the exposition dump across the first half-hour, to the badly-shot fight scenes, and the ugly Zach Snyder-style cinematography, nearly every aspect of this film is incompetent.
I could list of innumerable poor decisions here, but to me the most egregious error the film makes is its second ending. (If you care, this is the spoiler-heavy section.) Ostensibly, the first ending of the film is when Diana kills the man she believes to be Aries and then the war continues unabated. For a moment, I thought she was going to be forced to learn a lesson about how she was wrong, and you can't kill just one person to stop a war. This would be a solid payoff to the naivety that had been thoroughly established up to this point, thus completing her arc. But alas, this is not what happens. Instead, she discovers the real Aries and proceeds to have a giant CGI-heavy fight with Aries that looks truly horrendous. Defeating Aries here stops the war, which means Diana was right all along and thus learned nothing. But she also defeated him in the most disgusting final fight I've ever witnessed. That ~20 min fight at the end brought the rating down 1 star, on its own.
I loved the first film Patty Jenkins directed, Monster; I view that as a near masterpiece. But here Jenkins has directed Wonder Woman as a character with no arc surrounded by other characters who also have no arc and who have essentially no impact on the plot. Wonder Woman learns nothing and gets into a lot of ugly-looking fights along the way. Her relationship with Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) is rather cute and she has a handful of funny lines with him, but sadly that's the only bits of value this film has to offer."

And I'm sorry Gal Gadot is not really pretty. Her accent and voice are annoying.
The romance is pointless, Steve doesn't even look interested on her, while she's totally smitten with him(in the cartoon it's pretty much the contrary). The action is weak. The story is lackluster, the villains are cheesy, her powers are confusing.

Set during a Great War, stars a hunky blonde guy played by an actor named Chris, centers around a character with a black and white sense of morality slowly learning that there's some gray area in the real world, and has a big dumb ending with a silly villain and lots of explosions. They also rip off the sacrifice scene even though it makes no sense as long as a functioning parachute was on board the plane... and why wouldn't one be?<br/><br/>After the dust settles, Wonder Woman was really just another decent super hero movie to add to the pile.

","I know this is a little different from the popular view, but I thought 'Wonder Woman' was just OK, though a decent way to spend summer afternoon. I liked a woman superhero, the diversity in the movie, and the character of the God of War, and how he debated the nature of humanity with Wonder Woman towards the end. On the other hand, it was too long, had some corny parts that should have been cut, and was kind of standard action hero fare, which are getting so common these days. There was this really touching scene of her dancing in the snow at night with the spy, and then I thought Director Patty Jenkins spoiled it by not just leaving it as it was, and instead showed them going upstairs to make love. I just thought that was cliché and unnecessary, just like the double entendres when he's standing there naked with his watch (""you mean you let that little thing tell you what to do?""). I also thought it was ironic that this version of Wonder Woman is hailed as the non-objectified version, when she's wearing a skimpy skirt, still has big breasts on full display, and is always perfectly made up. It's hit and miss, and I would also note, not appropriate for little kids, much as we may want to show them a female superhero."
"screenmunch","6","1","6","7 July 2017"," Wonder Woman stomps and staggers
","Let me start by saying that I originally had no intention of seeing this film – purely for the fact I am so lost when it comes to superhero films. There are so many out there right now and with so many crossovers and connected story lines. I feel a bit like I have fallen behind. Friends of mine invited me to go along with them to watch it so I decided to go in like I would any normal action- adventure film and try not to think of it as part of a bigger universe. I'll be blunt – Wonder Woman is good. It's not great. It's not bad.<br/><br/>So, what makes it good? Diana (Gal Gadot) and Steve (Chris Pine) have a great, and at times quite funny, relationship in this film. There are a couple of scenes towards the beginning of the film that feature just both of them (one in particular where Pine is completely naked with just a hand covering his apparently ""above average"" package) and they do actually make you giggle and the language between them has you mesmerised.<br/><br/>Many characters in this film were probably not needed, although Etta Candy (Lucy Davis) was not one of them. Every word she uttered had left the views laughing and definitely kept a light humored cushion on at times an overly dramatic epic. It would have been nice to have seen more of her.<br/><br/>Ninety percent of the visuals were on top form, especially the close combat scenes entering occasional slow-mos and the Aries showdown towards the end of the movie definitely deserves a thumbs up. However, some might say the simpler effects, such as explosions, did look a little rusty – sometimes doing a practical effect is worth it guys!<br/><br/>What let the film down? As much as I like David Thewlis, the role Aries, God of War, did not suit him. I found Elena Anaya and Danny Huston's characters; Doctor Poison and General Ludendorff, borderline annoying and they didn't really give much to the story like antagonists should. The plot stomps and staggers and at times you're not really sure where it is going. Having said that, the structure of the story felt much more coherent than some of the superhero flicks I actually have seen of late.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman could do with filtering out some of the characters and slightly more attention to its story wouldn't have hurt it. It's certainly worth a watch - if not for the mighty kick-ass Gal Gadot, then maybe the butt-naked Chris Pine."
"suws1","6","1","6","26 June 2017"," Honest Wonder Woman review -superhero movie by numbers-
","Wonder Woman, the DCU movie that finally convinces critics and get's an 8,1 IMDb rating to date. Everyone seems to board the hype train, but honestly...it's not that great. Don't get me wrong, Wonder Woman is an interesting movie. Has all the known elements of superhero-origins type movies: the secret back story, the loving parent, the loving trainer, the discovery of the powers, the finding of the truth, the love interest, the super-villain, the comic relief, etecetera, etecetera...and that's it! The only ""novelty"" here is that the superhero is a woman, the rest is same old, same old. The acting is decent, as per expected in a superhero movie, nothing real special, no Oscars here. Gal Gadot does a wonderful job as Wonder Woman, as she portrays beauty and a bad ass perfectly, personally I liked it very much, the rest of the cast are there to support the hero, so no one shines brighter than Gadot, and maybe no one should, so, as I said before: decent acting, nothing big here. The Special effects are decent, but also, nothing real special...probably they could and should have done better. Sound effects and soundtrack are good, perhaps the best thing about the movie. The Wonder Woman theme is very adequate, and gives the right mood, but even that was created in Batman VS Superman...so, once again, no novelty... The directing and production are also as expected for a superhero movie: Good wardrobe, beautiful locations, action scenes, superpowers and explosions. So, where does Wonder Woman excel? What does it do differently than the other 5 or 6 superhero movies that comes out every year? What makes it so special? In my opinion: Nothing! Not a single thing. It's superhero movie by the numbers. Entertainment at it's best, but not a special movie, not something we will talk about in 2 or 3 years, not a game changer. My best guess is, it's polical correctness at it's prime once again. A superhero movie, with a female superhero and a woman directing, it can't be anything short of great. But, really, it isn't. It's on the same level as ""Captain America"", ""BatmanVSSuperman"" and most of the superhero movies: Great entertainment popcorn movies to spend a good 2 hours. Don't expect to be mind blown..."
"torka858","7","1","6","18 June 2017"," Good movie, not great...just good
","I would hesitate to say this movie was anything better than just 'good'. It's very far from great, but I would recommend seeing it at least once, especially if you enjoy comic book movies.<br/><br/>The acting and environments were top shelf through the movie, and the cinematography was pretty good for most of the film.<br/><br/>It started out a little shaky as it was presented needlessly as a flashback and the writing was pretty lame throughout, as it pertains to dialogue and many of the plot points.<br/><br/>The first third of the movie was fairly enjoyable and well paced and would have led to a much better movie had it continued the same way, but at some point it went from being about a hero with a sidekick to a team movie. The team was completely pointless and contributed nothing to the story.<br/><br/>From that point on it tromped along okay, kind of straddling the line of 'not bad' and 'why would they do that?'. It was riddled with some pretty sidetracked feeling events, with decent action and effects, redundant interactions between the characters and some really forced feeling evil doers.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie I couldn't help thinking that something plot related hadn't happened in a long time, and there was seemingly no endpoint in sight. Until a surprise, way over the top CG fight that was instigated alright, but proceeded poorly, and had a pretty badly written pause and then a final culmination that seemed like a special effects student was told to make some really gaudy eyesore effects for the ending of a random B-movie.<br/><br/>Overall it wasn't nearly as terrible as Suicide Squad, and not nearly as good as Man of Steel, but it did leave me feeling like it was another DC movie that missed the mark. I give it a solid 7/10, I'd probably watch it again, but I'd never pay to see it again."
"arthur_blom","8","1","6","17 June 2017"," Entertaining but not what I hoped it to be
","I was looking forward to Wonder Woman especially after seeing Gal Gadot's performance in Batman vs. Superman. She was easily the best part of that movie so to see a whole movie devoted to her character couldn't go wrong... or so I thought. Perhaps Gal Gadot acting skills are not strong enough to carry her through an entire movie as the lead character. Her performance was a bit flat and nothing like the quirkiness and power she showed in Batman vs. Superman.<br/><br/>I saw the movie in 3D which was also a disappointment. Nothing really came off the screen and aside some nice depth shots it was too much looking like a 2D movie. Save your money on this if you're wondering between 2D or 3D.<br/><br/>This movie has a bunch of spectacular moments but the times in between the action scenes felt quite flat to me. The introduction and coming of age of Wonder Woman was OK but felt a bit 'been there done that'. <br/><br/>The growing romance between WW and Steve Trevor (portrayed by Chris Pine) was dull and lacked chemistry. <br/><br/>The story was OK but felt like a rehashed script of a bunch of other superhero, action and Sci-Fi movies. The whole debate if we humans are worth to be rescued by the Gods who should protect us is done to death. Gathering a bunch of flawed men who turn into heroes also felt very familiar. The final battle also had a cliché moral question where WW did everything 'by the numbers' so there was not a single surprise in the entire movie. <br/><br/>That leaves us with the effects and action. Those I did enjoy and especially in a Dolby Atmos theater it was a feast to my ears as well as my eyes :) Especially the scene where Wonder Woman runs towards the Germans in the trenches was pretty cool dodging and blocking all the gunfire. <br/><br/>Plotwise it also has it flaws but that seems to be linked to most superhero movies these days. <br/><br/>All in all it was still entertaining and if you haven't seen too many superhero and action movies this may still feel a bit fresh to you. For seasoned superhero fans it was too cliché and 'paint by the numbers' to be surprising and unique."

","The movie takes place during World War I. When a fighter pilot (Chris Pine) crash lands onto her home island, the title character (Gadot) decides to go to his world to defeat the Greek god of war, Ares, thus ending the war.<br/><br/>This movie follows a traditional superhero movie formula. There are very few surprises in the story, but there is enough charm to make up for that.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot gave a show-stealing performance in Batman v Superman, and her version of Wonder Woman holds up as the front and center of her own movie. She pulls off the warrior attitude very well, but also has moments of wonder and naivete, as she is introduced to the unfamiliar human world. She also has great chemistry with Chris Pine, who acts as a love interest for her.<br/><br/>The tone is also much more lighthearted than previous DC movies. It isn't nearly as upbeat and funny as The Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy, but it is definitely a move away from the darkness of Man of Steel and Batman v Superman.<br/><br/>However, it is still held back by its unoriginal story, and by its overlong run-time of two and a half hours.

"QuintLives","8","1","6","12 June 2017"," A Good DC Movie!
","Lo and behold, we have a good DC Universe movie! I despise Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad. Hate them. Loathe them. I named Suicide Squad the worst movie of 2016 and would have done the same for Man of Steel had I been doing such lists that year. But there was one sliver of hope in Batman v Superman and that was, ironically, Wonder Woman. There was a brief moment at the end of that film that I actually enjoyed. It was when Wonder Woman finally showed up in costume and the so-called superhero trinity of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman stood side-by-side. It was a moment that I had waited to see since I was a kid and, for a brief moment, I felt like a kid and had a huge smile on my face. Then the movie continued and I resumed hating the world. But I kept a small hope that a Wonder Woman movie could get this trainwreck back on track. And this movie mostly delivers on that hope. Mostly.<br/><br/>This is an origin story and I usually don't like origin stories. But, considering it has taken such a ridiculously long time for Wonder Woman to get her own movie, I suppose she deserves it. We begin on the hidden island of Themyscira, where Wonder Woman is growing up and training among her fellow Amazons. Hidden from the rest of the world and training for the eventual return of Aries, the God of War, all goes well until a British spy named Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine) crashes into the island. Wonder Woman hears of the ongoing World War happening beyond the island and insists that Aries must be the cause of it. She accompanies Trevor to the outside world with the intent of going to the front line and combating Aries. The film takes a lot of liberties with the source material, but I am okay with that when the changes work in the context of the film. For example, I love the Burton and Nolan Batman movies and they take massive liberties. While this isn't quite as good as those, it is good enough for me to give it a pass.<br/><br/>Most of this movie works really well. Wonder Woman looks perfect and, unlike most other characters in these movies, actually acts like her comic book counterpart. Both Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are great and their chemistry together is strong. Even the usually cringe-worthy fish-out-of-sea jokes work here primarily because Gadot and Pine work really well together. I laughed at several moments that could have felt forced and cheesy in other films. The musical score is excellent and Wonder Woman's theme perfectly embodies the character. The supporting characters are generally strong as are the action scenes. There is one sequence that deserves special mention: The No Man's Land Sequence. This is when Wonder Woman, seeing the brutality of war, has her screw-this moment. Emerging from a trench, she storms into No Man's Land (symbolism!) on her own, charges the German trench, kicks the living crap out of everything in sight and single-handedly frees an occupied village. It is a perfect summary of the empathy-fueled rage of the character. For anyone that has been wanting to see Wonder Woman on the big screen, this sequence alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>So this movie is about 80% awesome and I was ready to write a completely glowing review. Then the last 20 minutes happened. Be warned, there be spoilers ahead.Wonder Woman spends the whole film convinced that Aries is behind the war. I spent the entire movie hoping that she was wrong and she would have to learn that humans can just be awful without any sort of evil influence. Sadly, that doesn't happen and Aries is behind it all. This leads to a massive, CGI-filled battle that feels like it is from a completely different movie than the preceding 2 hours. The tonal shift is jarring and feels like the result of a note from studio executives saying ""we need more stuff to blow up!!"" It's dumb and betrays what the rest of the film establishes. If I had written the film (and Warner Bros., please call me; I can help), this film would have been 20 minutes shorter and ended on a more somber note. But, no, we need to have a CGI monster to fight because, damn it, that's how these movies are supposed to end. Disappointing.<br/><br/>Aside from that gripe, this is quite good and I recommend seeing it in theaters. I own thousands of DC comics and it is a huge relief for me that this is actually a solid movie. But, don't worry. The Justice League movie is right around the corner, so Affleck and company are once again poised to steal my Wonder Woman-inspired happiness and convert it back into seething hate. So, I have that going for me. Which is nice."

","Wonder Woman is the 4th installment of the DC Cinematic Universe movies. To my surprise, it didn't get steamrolled like with the previous DC movies. In fact, many critics really enjoyed this film. In spite of this, I wasn't really excited about seeing this movie. However, I decided that I want to see all the DCEU movies in theaters, so I went to see it.<br/><br/>As far as story is concerned, it didn't impress me as much as I'd like it to. Now I do like the action sequences, those were the best parts the film has to offer. It really adds to the serious tone that the film is going for. I should bring up that there was one action sequence that really gave this film a triumphant feel to it. That Wonder Woman is now Wonder Woman. Charging through battle and just steamrolling through an army. I also want to mention that the final battle is also interesting as well. I won't say what happens, but it's a visual astonishment and concludes the story fairly well. The film also had moments that had me laughing at times. A few of the characters are pretty good with my favorites being the side characters that tag along with the 2 main characters. The villains are also alright.<br/><br/>However, my issues with the film is that the first couple of minutes in the Amazon island were tedious. Throughout that time, I was just bored, I was slowly drinking my slushy, and when I finished the slushy, I was actually tempted to fall asleep. Even out of the Amazon Island and into London, there are moments that just feel awkward. I felt like covering my faces, my ears, or both. The character drama honestly rubs me the wrong way. Character drama is a very hard thing to pull off, but most of the character dramas that ends up happening makes me care less for these characters. One of them in particular actually made me care less for Wonder Woman herself. The amazon characters are forgettable, the queen was overly generic and stale. The plot twist at the end felt very underwhelming. I didn't see it coming since I usually tend to guess incorrectly, but the way it was revealed just made me feel like it could have been better.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a film that has been consistently average, and one that I would never watch again. It has it's flaws and it has it's moments. I'm not willing to say it's a great movie, but not a stain to DC's record."

","Wonder Woman attempts to explore the human condition, particularly mankind's relation with warfare and peace. This simple premise with a World War I setting, and Wonder Woman's perspective is an excellent opportunity to create a gripping narrative about the dichotomy of the human condition that is war and peace.<br/><br/>However, poor representation of WWI leaves the premise feeling hollow and empty, as well as missing out on excellent opportunities to flesh out the narrative more deeply.<br/><br/>WWI is a war that was caused by a mess of interlocking treaties and a series of seminal events, thus there were no good or bad sides in the war, but Wonder Woman attempts to portray the Germans as being the ""bad guys"" as they were the only ones in the film to use chemical weapons. The film's attempt to portray the cruelties of war missed out on vital opportunities such as gas attacks, wave attacks against machine gun positions, and shell-shock caused by enduring artillery bombardments from days on end. Another opportunity missed are the Christmas day truce which would've shown the good side of humanity in war.<br/><br/>Greek mythology was also warped for this film - which was disappointing.<br/><br/>The movie is also hampered by a predictable plot, plot holes, and cliche's that are more fitting for a Saturday cartoon. The film also doesn't go into depth about the Amazons - which would've been another opportunity to show contrast between the paradise island Wonder Woman grew up in, and the trying times of the early 20th Century.<br/><br/>The CGI is decent, though there are parts where it becomes obvious that the scene is a green screen. Action is decent enough, but is lackluster in the final battle.<br/><br/>I will give this movie props for not making it one huge gender vs gender fest, but rather a cooperative story that acknowledges the sexism that was existent during the early 20th century.<br/><br/>A lot could've been done to make Wonder Woman a better movie, but alas it is not."

"fort-alexander","8","1","6","7 June 2017"," Not a perfect film but a lot of fun.
","I just went to see this movie a day ago. I wanted to let it sit in my mind and digest for a day before I wrote a review. The first thing to know about this film is that is primarily an origin story. That means that the primary focus is on developing and setting up the Wonder Woman character for subsequent movies. One of the complaints that I see about this movie is that villains are weak, they don't get enough screen time and that they are not scary or formidable. However, since this is an origin story movie it stands to reason that the villains aren't and shouldn't be the main focus of the movie. The cast for this film is very good. Gal Gadot....what can i say? She's gorgeous and has powerful screen presence as the titular character. I've seen some complaints about her acting and how she's written. Ex: Wonder Woman acts like and idiot, like an 18 year old etc. Howerver, this is not the same Wonder Woman that is in Batman v. Superman. This movie takes place 100 years before said movie. Her character is sheltered and naive and this movie is very much about how she starts to grow and learn as a person. Chris Pine has great chemistry with Gal Gadot and their relationship is very sweet and not overpowering. The supporting characters are fun but a little underdeveloped. All of the characters are very likable. I do have to say this: the accents for the other amazons (I'm looking at you Robin Wright) are very distracting and kind of terrible. The action scenes in this movie are also top notch. Are they over the top? Absolutely. Is there a little bit too much CGI? Yes. But is good CGI and the action scenes are a lot of fun. Humor in this movie is very fresh and relatable. It's not too much but it lightens up the movie. I'm very glad DC seems to be listening to their fans. Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman are just waaay too serious. This movie feels a little bit more light-hearted and its a better film for it. This is a long movie, with about a 2 hour 20 min running time. It has a lot of exposition but that's to be expected with an origin story. I think now that the Wonder Woman character is established and everything is set up the next Wonder Woman movie will be even better. Go see it. Fun, action, romance, beautiful Gal Gadot. What's not to love?"

","Saw it. Yep that is right no Dallas movie theater keeps me away. I been listening to the back and forth of the online soldiers of sexism for about a year now regarding this one. To paraphrase a famous critic : All wonder woman does is prove that feminist and misogynist trolls can get pumped up over a movie.<br/><br/>I remember when no one gave a rat's @$$ about your politics in a movie theater.<br/><br/>Now , for the movie. I went to this movie expecting to see the superheros story arc attuned by its creator for this individual named Diana . In no way did that disappoint In fact the arc was pretty tight and actually save this movie at times where film flow could have been a disaster. No real issues with direction , the historical settings and prop concepts were fairly accurate ( I love WW 1 air combat) of course things felt comic bookish at times , big surprise right.<br/><br/>The story line was a good one in the idea of presenting the character and conflicts of origin in a super hero. To be honest though it felt a little to soap opera at certain points.<br/><br/>It looks like this one passed . I recommend seeing it . It is summer and summer is the time for special effects big budget films."

","Captain America was better for two reasons -- his patriotism and the lack of any naked men being on display. While we enjoyed most of the WW movie, it is irksome to see Hollywood screwing with the feature to make their liberal points. Point one: Does every movie have to feature a naked man? Is this on the Gay agenda, or -- due to the director being female -- is she a pervert? Yes, we see that all of the teenage boys and beer-drinking crowd laugh at the scene, it seems most embarrassing to the actor and those of us who still have a shred of decency. Point two: The Native American Indian blames the white man for the loss of his country. The Onondaga Nation, a part of the Iroquois Confederacy, unilaterally declared war on Germany, citing ill-treatment of tribal members who were stranded in Berlin at the beginning of hostilities. The Oneida Nation, another member of the Iroquois Confederacy, also declared war on Germany. Over ten thousand Native Americans went to war to help America save the world. When WWII came along, the Native Americans joined by the ten's of thousands to help save the rest of the world a second time. What a great line it would have been if the Native American said something like: America is my country too!"
"jctundis","8","1","6","6 June 2017"," Easily the best DCU movie since 2008's Batman: The Dark Knight
","I saw Wonder Woman on Sunday night, and it's one of those rare movies that after mulling over I actually like a bit more than my initial opinion upon viewing. Not that I'm going to say it's some kind of tear inducing piece of theatrical perfection, because it's not. It has its faults like any other film: a superfluous and unnecessary framing sequence, the typical (albeit brief) pacing problems in the middle, repetitive action sequences (not counting the much lauded – and deservedly so – charge into ""No Man's Land"" scene) a cheesy ending (the levels and details of which I can't discuss without revealing major plot points) and a couple of lame jokes (how many times are they going to use the ""Wonder Woman loves ice cream"" gag?) – most of which can be blamed on the screenplay by the usual suspects, Allan Heinberg and Zack Snyder.<br/><br/>That being said, the positive things about Wonder Woman are legion in comparison.<br/><br/>Obviously, the casting of Gal Gadot worked beautifully. Being one of the only positive elements in the abysmal Batman V Superman movie, her quality as the lead is now amplified. She already had the attitude and presence for the character, now bolstered by a more muscular physique and clearer (yet wonderfully distinct) accent. Gadot made it look easy, projecting power and confidence in her moral obligation to the world, while also having those moments of somewhat vulnerable naiveté in a world she is only just discovering.<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins is a thousand times the director that Zack Snyder is. She understands the value of a solid story and consistent character development. It was wonderful to see supporting characters developed enough to actually care about them, and the way Jenkins maneuvered through the potential political minefield this project presented was masterful. Case in point – the aforementioned ""No Man's Land"" sequence. Not only was it a taught and exciting action scene, but the mutual respect and camaraderie that developed between the primary cast members was about as perfect a message about equality as one could hope for.<br/><br/>Even subjects like the suffragette movement in the UK, employment, sexuality (cleverly referencing the writings of a Greek muse to explain the obviousness of lesbianism on Themyscira) (Chris Pine's awesome ""bathing beefcake"" scene) and even the white man's treatment of Native Americans were handled with humor and grace (instead of a browbeating), reminding me of the work of Michele Fazekas & Tara Butters on the excellent and lamented Agent Carter TV series. Perhaps it's easier when working on a period piece in 1916 where there are examples of sexism so obvious and blatant that everyone can look at it and go ""No, that is wrong."" There's even a pseudo-bondage scene near the end for those hardcore fans of Wonder Woman's early comic years.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was excellent, with the possible exception of David Thewlis whose performance I found thoroughly uninspiring (especially in comparison to his work on the current season of Fargo) and some of Connie Nielsen's lines while trying to emulate Gadot's accent were a bit cringe inducing. <br/><br/>All in all, it's a very positive movie experience in terms of both theme and quality. I'm actually disappointed it didn't have a bigger opening weekend considering super hero movies are still in vogue and Wonder Woman is one of the top 5 most recognizable and popular super heroes in history! It's relatively family-friendly – aside from wartime violence (loud noises, deaths, etc) and the only love scene is alluded to but not shown.<br/><br/>8.3/10 Easily the best DCU movie since 2008's Batman: The Dark Knight"
"brankovranjkovic","6","1","6","6 June 2017"," Not a Great Film, but not a Bad Film Either
","There are 2 aspects that drew me to this DC origin action film. > The Rotten Tomatoes 93% rating. > Very hot Gal Gadot as Princess Diana, cast from clay and brought to life by Zeus. <br/><br/>As this is an origin film we see Princess Diana grow from childhood to the superhero adult (a bit like Superman). She belongs to a society run by women in a paradise island where the weather is summer all year round and the landscape is perfect. It looks like a Greek island, probably Lezbos judging by the large number of 'hard looking' girls on screen. They are all young, attractive and they can fight. In contrast the world outside is miserable, grey, violent and at war. The women are great warriors, Diana undertakes many years of rigorous fight training and she possesses supernatural powers as well. Eventually Diana manages to displace her trainer and becomes the all-powerful and really hot (I mean really hot!) Wonder Woman. <br/><br/>So everything is wonderful until Chris Pine arrives with war in his blood and his above average body parts! The plot is around the prevention of the use of a new deadly gas during World War 1. <br/><br/>The villain in the plot is Aries, the God of War. He is jealous of Zeus's humanity and has been provoking wars for thousands of years. Chris Pine is the normal female eye-candy, the audience becomes attached to this character although he ultimately dies in a most heroic manner. He pilots a plane full of poisoned gas cans and strangely decides to blow up the plane rather than land safely to deal with the dangerous cargo! This decision just spreads the gas for 100's of miles, causing millions of deaths, which preventing this was precisely the point of the plot! (ehhh? -I was confused) <br/><br/>Dr Poison is the female villain who creates the gas but her life is spared by Wonder Woman, while Chris Pine is the male hero but is killed off!. Therefore, all men are evil except for Pine who dies anyway. All women are good except for Dr Poison, who lives. <br/><br/>There's a major twist at the end, the identity of Aries is not who you expect it to be and not who Wonder Woman believes it to be. Dianna presumes the senior German officer is Aries and kills him but the war is not brought to an end. Aries turns out to be the head of the British government, Sir Patrick, who has been collaborating with the Germans.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman was created in 1942, she was the red, white 'n' blue American patriotic heroin although Diana Prince is definitely seen to be a global heroin. Not a great film but not a bad film either and not a good example of a film to see in 3D."

","Wonder Woman is currently one of Warner Bros.' best-reviewed superhero movie for about a decade. I think this movie is overrated by far. The plot was overly simplistic even for this type of film; it was choppy, predictable and stretched out. In my view, the movie doesn't create any drama or buildup to a climax that lures the viewer in. There is no point where you think Wonder Woman will be defeated. What is her weakness? Once we feel she is invincible, where can the movie develop? My view that her chemistry with Chris Pine was far from the quoted ""magnetic"", although, separately, each of them individually are charismatic. There was a hint of romance between them but that did not develop. Antiope, the Amazons tribes chief played by Robin Wright delivered a stellar performance. Overall, an impressive soundtrack coupled several action scenes and a touch of humor weren't enough to lift this movie off the ground."

","With Batman VS Superman and Suicide Squad suffering from mixed to negative reviews and troubled production (even I was 50/50 on SS and preferred the Ultimate Cut of BVS), does Wonder Woman fall to the same fate as they did? Nope, but it does soar to the great lengths of recovery to being one of the best DC films since The Dark Knight. Firstly, Gal Gadot shines incredibly in the role. Having shown this in a small role in BVS, it's here she's given everything to show emotion, strength and agility to the character well known to comic fans and female followers. I won't lie but I did doubt her in the role when she was first cast but seeing her in the role has really blew expectations. The supporting cast as well were all great, giving purpose to the story and pacing and humour wasn't so heavily forced it does work.<br/><br/>The plot here is actually decent and there's no flaws like SS did, it has a decent amount of time for character development, connection and purpose (like the purpose to why Diana wants to make a better place of the world), tightly shot but awesome action sequences, great production design and value (the Greek world of the Amazonians to the gritty realism of war in the real world) and a solid director with a keen eye on storytelling. Patty Jenkins was a great choice to helm this first ever female superhero movie, delivering one that will surely won't be a failure with critics and the box office.<br/><br/>While with no signs of negativity present (despite the CGI overuse in the third act) WW is a great treat for all fans and audiences alike, with great detail in character development, solid action, amazing production design and value and a great leading lady as the female superhero. Believe me, it's indeed up there with Logan and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in my best films for the year list and probably the best DC Extended Universe film so far.<br/><br/>4/5 - The Autistic Reviewers"
"sunraider","7","1","6","3 June 2017"," Good First Half Marred by Poor Final Act
","Unfortunately, I came out of the theater underwhelmed as the final act was such a let down compared to the kick-ass 1st act. The 1st act of the film, which mostly takes place on the Amazon's island, was the best part of the entire movie. The backstory of the Amazons was interestingly depicted through Renaissance-type paintings coming to life and the Amazon women were so charismatic , particularly Robin Wright, who steals every scene she's in. The battle between the Amazons and a small invasion force of WWI-era German marines was visually stunning and exciting. The use of slo-mo worked here because of the contrast between the modern weaponry of the sailors and the bows, arrows, and spears used by the Amazons. <br/><br/>The wonderful chemistry between the leads carries over into the 2nd act, which takes place in London, where WW is a fish-out-of-water and Chris Pine's Steve Trevor has to show her the ropes. But, this is where things start to go downhill. Instead of the amazing Amazons, WW is saddled with a new posse that fails to make much of an impression save for the character of ""Sameer,"" a fez-wearing, flirtatious charmer. The baddies, a German General and a scarred female scientist known as ""Dr. Poison,"" are underdeveloped and remain little more than comic-book clichéd characters.<br/><br/>The final act is, ultimately, a mishmash of comic book and good vs. evil tropes, elevated by the convincing and winning performances by the two leads. Because I genuinely liked them as individual characters and as a pairing, the lame finale is bearable. It's almost unbelievable that they killed off Robin Wright's character so early in the film. The 3rd act could have been elevated by the appearance of Robin Wright to help WW bring down Ares. If you're going to kill off such a bad-ass character, why not do it in the final act when the stakes are most high. Also, the 3rd Act wasted an opportunity to give us baddies that had some depth. Dr. Poison could have been a more nuanced character whose outward disfigurement mirrored an even more broken soul. The scene where she seemed to be giving in to Steve Tevor's flirtations but once again became embittered when she saw that he was distracted by the arrival of WW, was so promising but, ultimately, the character remained woefully underdeveloped.<br/><br/>A terrific cast with undeniable chemistry elevated this movie but it could have been better."

","Wonder Woman is about a young woman who is part of a tribe called the Amazons who live on a island created by Zeus away from the rest of the world. But one day a World War Two American soldier washes up on the shaw of the island and tells them of the terrible war going on she decides to go with him back to the war and fight.<br/><br/>For the first act of this film I wasn't very into it. I thought that the two main characters were good but nothing to great and there were some attempts at humour that fell pretty flat.<br/><br/>However there was a part were a few new characters got introduced and suddenly the film got way more interesting. The new characters were very funny and charming but at that point the already existing character became more interesting. The relationship between the young girl or Wonder Woman, or though she's never referred as that in the film, and the American solder, played by Gal Gadot and Chris Pine, felt really realistic and they had really good chemistry. The villains, of which there are about three, two were kinda bland but still mildly interesting. The other one was I thought was really cool and well done and performed. It also did a really good job of making it seem like you were in a World War Two setting. Apart from the line ""well that's neat"" all the dialogue sounded like it was from a person from 1940's. Now lets talk about the best part of the film, the action. I'm not kidding when I say that I think this film has some of the best fight scenes I've ever seen in a film ever. The film has about three big action scenes which are all amazing, but it doesn't action non stop all the time, it's balanced out by character moments that were really good as well. The action was so well shot and unlike other films with lots of action I never got bored at all. It was so cool and exciting and I would recommend Wonder Woman to anyone who's a fan of really exciting and well done action movies with good character."
"JordanMccPhoto","2","1","7","1 May 2019"," Most competent DCEU film, also the most boring.
","Perhaps the biggest problem with Wonder Woman is the hype. I was promised a good viewing experience, but what I got was a tedious slog.<br/><br/>While Wonder Woman manages to be the most competent film the DCEU, it's also the most boring. BvS and Suicide Squad may have been disasters, but it's possible for one to find enjoyment in such unbelievable levels of incompetence. There's a point where a film becomes so incomprehensibly inept that it ceases to be a film, and turns into some kind of performance art. Wonder Woman, unfortunately, never reaches that point and remains so painfully mediocre it's not even fun to watch as a joke.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman reportedly had a budget over 100 million dollars, but one is left wondering where all that money went, as the it's filled with some of the worst CGI in modern cinema. None of the jokes made me laugh, but the CGI in Wonder Woman had me in stitches, and that's before it devolved into the usual DC CGI mess at the end.<br/><br/>The final nail in the coffin of Wonder Woman as a film is that it chooses to end with one of the worst looking and tensionless CGI boss fights in modern cinema, rather than exploring more interesting ideas present throughout the film.<br/><br/>I'll give credit where credit is due. Both Gal Gadot and Chris Pine make the most of the script they were given. Unfortunately not even their serviceable performances could save this film from being a 140 minute snooze-fest.<br/><br/>While Wonder Woman proves to be the most competent film in the DCEU, it also proves that it's better to be hilariously incompetent than painfully mediocre."

I went with such expectation and left with a sour feeling. It pissed me off more when there were such good things in the movie being buried by such mediocrity.<br/><br/>I love Chris Pine in this movie. His chemistry with WW is amazing. Gal Gadot is replaceable, some scenes are good and some are bad. Her acting is inconsistent. 3rd act was horrible. It's the classic DC mediocrity. Must every fight scene be in slow motion? It's just annoying. If she's that strong it would be in the action and punches. Not in gimmick. Hey look, isn't she awesome?

","I reviewed this previously and think I was overly harsh. If this movie had been made at the time of the first Superman movie, it'd possibly be amongst my favorite old movies. If this was actually a long unpublished script, it's pretty neat. However, in light of what we've learned in the past several decades, there are significant issues I can't overlook.<br/><br/>The depiction of Themascara is essentially canon, but canon was altered enough in other instances that this could've been upgraded too. The action shots were great, but actually framing why they train, why they fight, what it means to be a general...it was all sort of glossed over in montage. What it means to build an all female society is also rather glossed over, which gives the impression ""don't look too closely, it's fragile"". Then another montage to set up and kill the Greek gods, save for one (maybe two), and not really define what it means to be a god, or how the world works, or...do I really need to pause the movie to brush up on my Greek mythology?<br/><br/>In classic superhero tales, the villains play a significant part in defining the heroes. Take Batman and the Joker for instance. Both are intensely dissatisfied with the way the world works, have altered their appearances accordingly, have taken drastic elaborate actions to change the world, and behave according to a set of principles. What sets Batman apart is that he wants to correct the system to its ideal state, and the Joker just wants it all to burn. You could make similar analogies for Superman or Spiderman or the Flash or...but when we look at Wonder Woman and Ares, we barely see Ares' personality, and Wonder Woman's actions are only figuratively godlike in most instances. Why build up the wrong bad guy? It's clever to begin with, but the chain isn't really completed, and we don't really have closure at the end.<br/><br/>Then there were micro-annoyances, like how she knew 100 languages, but hadn't studied anything relevant to the small talk of our group of heroes, nor the conduct and procedures of heads of state. For being ""so well read"", we could've got more than a few cheap allusions. Or how she let a bullet whiz right past her into a fellow Amazon, but in the very next action scene she's instinctively blocking all bullets in 360 degrees with her bracelets. And the lasso shots were great, but really felt like the special effects guy didn't work with the one from Batman vs Superman, where the lasso was used in a more intuitive manner. Also, more proficiency (lasso) without any shown training in her time as an Amazon.<br/><br/>Lastly, why is the chain of dialogue for her personal development centered on the importance of ""belief"". What are those beliefs and why are we empowering a generation of young girls with such a generic moral imperative? Do we really want the rhetoric of Wonder Woman to be re-purposed by each girl's respective religious leader?"

But when I saw she is not a bad woman but a good and heroic, I changed my side and become one of her. Maybe the 'Love can save' massage is not that much strong but yeah, it molten my heart. Now speak of other things, I really hate Olympus gods (No offense ether). But it seems the movie set on far beyond that. I wonder why there's only girls on that island. Why Zeus thought women are the best choice for saving world? And also why Diana always have to wear short dress? I mean every superheros have changed for movie adaptation, but she still wears that .... I don't know what she wears. Speaking of end, it was great. The sacrifice of Steve (Like Steve in MCU) was really touchy. I think this is the one that made me feel love for other people. I am a MCU fan but of course, I'll like every DCEU movies."

The reason why I'm left wondering is because this film is average fare & by no means the cinematic gem it has been touted as.<br/><br/>The film's narrative is shaky & some of the dialogue (especially early on) is painful. The acting is okay, however the lead is a touch statuesque. At the end of the day this is a kid's film that has been marketed to adults & therein lies the flaws & the difference between DC characters, ergo films, as opposed to Marvel.<br/><br/>With the exception of Batman, most DC characters are for younger children & therefore it is extremely difficult to adapt them for adult cinematic consumption. Wonder Woman is basically a fairytale Princess from a magical realm whereas a character like Nebula (& Gamora) is a victim of unimaginable torture/mutilation/abuse & therefore inherently darker & appealing to the more mature palate.<br/><br/>I think there may be a possible political narrative behind the promotion of this average film as being a masterpiece (which it clearly isn't) & if true, that is insidious & unwelcome.<br/><br/>Conclusion: This is a kid's film. It's a film about a magical princess - so don't get your hopes up too much if you're over 16. It's an okay/average event with some good parts & some not so good."

","Diana Prince receives a picture from ? She thinks back to her life and how she got to where the picture was taken, flashback time. Outside of the Batman movies directors and story writers don't seem to be able to have the same success as Marvel. It's not that these movies are bad they just aren't as good as their rivals. With Suicide Squad they at least seemed to finally got there, then came Wonder Woman. The movie is watchable but lacks any zing. Diana is born on an island (last ever born) to a race of women who's job is to defeat Aries should he ever return. Next we get the Aunt training Diana to fight, much against her mommy's wishes, fast fwd a few years and she has to fight off German who are trying to kill an American soldier after they get through the magic veil that hides the island - wow not.

Finally kills the baddie but wait he's not the real baddie oh no it's the auld geezer who is in fact Aries. Replay some of the Batman vs Superman end fight and Wonder Woman prevails.

"tuanskie","5","1","7","24 June 2017"," Wasn't as expected
","I had higher expectations for this movie coming into the theater. With all the hype surrounding a big budget film that cast Gal Gadot as the main character, who just happens to be a woman, and the advertising that was poured into portraying Wonder Woman as the positive antithesis to the vulgarity that is ""man"" (and elevated female prowess by association), it didn't stand up to many of the movies in the superhero genre (such as Civil War, Iron Man 3, etc.). While the film at its moments with flashes of brightness and endearment, the best part of the movie involved the natural chemistry between WW and Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), but the rest of the movie was left for interpretation as to whether it was great (WW lovers camp), mediocre, or really bad. I fall in the middle for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. Gal Gadot is beautiful, but her acting performance was OK. It was not a break-out role for her by any stretch of the imagination. Much of the dialogue in a number of scenes involved screaming back at Steve and that's hardly acting. She is easy on the eyes to look at, to hear (when not screaming), to like, and I wanted so much to be absorbed by her portrayal of a superhuman with a fine balance of perfections and flaws, but in the end, she reduced to just another pretty face. 2. The CGI and action scenes were so-so. They weren't the best nor were they the worst. Perhaps what made some it fatiguing at times was the frequent use of slow-motion jump twists that the Amazonians and WW herself do. Granted, I'd rather see those moves than the more laughable Scarlett Johansson jump on the shoulder-squeeze the neck with thighs move in the IM and CA movies. Simply put, they could have hired a better fight choreographer for the actresses, as many sequences were simply not believable or too cheesy to digest. 3. Wonder Woman was too powerful. She could have simply taken care of ending the war by herself, crushing all the evil males, while Steve and his male recruits (Chief et al.) were not nearly as relevant to any degree - maybe for the sake of comic relief and emotional empathy. 4. The main villain, Ares (David Thewlis), immediately gave me flashbacks of Harry Potter. There was a scene where I just thought, ""No way Remus!"" The scene to me was more comical than it was believable.<br/><br/>There was one person in the theater, a woman, who clapped incessantly throughout the movie, especially when WW raised her shield to fight off a bunch of baddies on the front line to the amazement and disbelief of Steve and fellows. While I understand this was somewhat about girl-power, it did get artificial and annoying. Perhaps Gal Gadot can win me over in the sequel :-)"
"FlashCallahan","8","1","7","17 June 2017"," Wonderful Woman....
","She is Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained to be an unconquerable warrior. Raised on a sheltered island paradise, Diana meets an American pilot who tells her about the conflict that's raging in the outside world. <br/><br/>Convinced that she can stop the threat, Diana leaves her home for the first time. Fighting alongside men in a war to end all wars, she finally discovers her full powers and true destiny.......<br/><br/>If a multi-verse film had everything banking on its success, Wonder Woman is the film. After the anti climax of Dawn Of Justice, Wonder Woman appeared to be just an afterthought.<br/><br/>But fear not, DC has made one of the most fun comic book films to appear in recent years. Yes, Marvel have raised the bar and seem unstoppable, but the studio have given us a comic book overload, and their films, whilst still very good, have become crowded and slightly bloated.<br/><br/>If you were going to compare this to any other Comic book adaptation, it has to be The First Avenger, which in my opinion is the second weakest film in the Marvel cannon (Just ahead of Thor: The Dark World).<br/><br/>The fundamental thing about Wonder Woman is that it's fun, with some much needed humour that has appeared to have been missing from previous DC movies.<br/><br/>Gadot is sensational as the titular character, a blend of Tarzan and the trait of a child going into an adults body (Big, Vice Versa etc), and she owns the film. Again, her character was pretty much wasted in BVS, but she was the best thing about it, and here,MIT just gets better.<br/><br/>Pine is at his best as the love interest, both heroic and goofy, and the chemistry between the two of them only excels the film a little more. The set pieces are amazing, the stand out being when Diana breaches no mans land. It's a goosebump moment that Patty Jenkins has wonderfully crafted.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the films villains are a bit of a damp squib. Huston is doing nothing more than playing a character straight from BBC sitcom Allo' Allo', with an accent that would make Arthur Bostrum cringe. <br/><br/>And the fact that he has a special inhaler that makes him shiny for a second, just takes you away from the narrative. And then there is David Thewlis.<br/><br/>To say anything more about Thewlis' character would spoil the film, but rest assured, it dampens the film a little.<br/><br/>But when the film is focused on Diana and her team, it's a delight.<br/><br/>Kudos to Jenkins for making the best DC film in nine years. <br/><br/>My faith for Justice League has grown now."

","In Batman V Superman the appearance of Wonder Woman was one of the few highlights of the movie. How well does Wonder Woman do on her own?<br/><br/>First let me start by saying how much I Love Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, she's ass kicking strong and her naivety is cute. I was expecting some pointless sexy poses in the movie but to my surprise there are none. And honestly, this movie doesn't need that. The movie portraits the Amazons with dignity and shows them as true warriors instead of women in sexy outfits. <br/><br/>I loved how the story of the Gods/Mankind was told during the first couple of scenes of the movie. It had the art style of the pieces of art you see in a museum and it was visually pleasing.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes were good but nothing we haven't seen before. Apparently slow motion is still the way to go to add to the coolness of a fighting move. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the humor in the movie, there were some situations that made me chuckle. <br/><br/>The acting was okay for a superhero movie, Chris Pine and Gal Gadot did a good job but the rest are okay/below average. <br/><br/>Talking about average, the story wasn't that great. It had everything you want in an origin story but there are also plenty of plot holes. Apparently it takes less than a day to get from Themyscira to London with a sailboat. Wonder Woman completely blows her trainer away with a shock-wave but everyone on the island acts like it's a normal thing for Diana to do. The bracelets, there is no explanation why she has them and why they are able to block firepower. I could go on but I don't want to be too picky. <br/><br/>Okay, one final thing, Ares is a dork. There is nothing cool about him. The ""twist"" was cool I guess but couldn't they have cast a less dorky guy as the main bad guy?"

In fact, him and his entire band of misfits are a horrible addition to this film. The relationship that brews between him and Diana is unbelievable, awkward, and cringeworthy. It undermines Diana's power and the ""girl power"" of this film. If Chris Pine was cut out entirely from this film, I would give it 9 stars. <br/><br/>The pacing of this film is also awkward.

The entire time, you can see it in her face that she has little imagination and so was unable to deliver accurate emotions of rage, pain and sadness. <br/><br/>There was a clear difference between her portrayal in this movie and the one that we first saw in Dawn of Justice. Wonder Woman is from an Island that is occupied only by women. They do everything themselves from building to fighting. There should not be any sassiness in her character. She is a warrior, and though she sure as hell kicked ass, those few moments where they showed her ""prettiness"" in otherwise intense moments totally ruined the weight of the scenes.

"dilipbts","7","1","8","7 June 2020"," Wondee woman
","Patty Jenkins' 'Wonder Woman' movie begins with a rocky, uneven start. But this very flawed pace allows the origin story of the amazonian warrior mature in a compelling build- up, and eventually navigate towards the rest of her story in a riveting seismic progression. It gathers an affectionate sentimentality that sustains its potency even amidst the imposing explosive sequences that often triumph to take the audience's attention away from the oddly satisfying distraction, that is Gal Gadot. There are these resonating anthems that remain ablaze throughout the film's 140-minute duration: love and peace, sacrifice and courage, and while it gets extremely preachy sometimes, the narrative rarely gets boring. Jenkins' take on the genre doesn't abandon the idea of terror, and mass destruction, but it singularly escapes the confines of superhero clichés that eliminate its players' moral form. In 'Wonder Woman', Diana Prince's humanity is held by Gadot's portrayal with a bracing commitment, something she never loses even when confronted with the deceptive appeal of evil and darkness. Her heroic verve gets an unexpected reinforcement from Chris Pine's Steve Trevor, with whom she shares a surprisingly inherent chemistry. This is the first DC film in a very long time, to ever sustain such visceral distinction, a visual extravaganza brimming with heart and reason.<br/><br/>Diana Prince's story takes us to a mysterious island known as Themyscira, hidden by Zeus in a protective dome of dim and mist, far from the grasp of humanity. She grows to believe that it is her sacred duty to protect her world, not knowing such 'world' will include what is beyond the clouds. But when the first man arrives in a suspicious water- crash landing, she expands her understanding and begins to welcome the idea of defending whoever needs help in the other side. But this eagerness barely entirely rests on a moral responsibility; she believes that Ares, the God of War, and her inevitable nemesis, is what causing the war waged by humans, and she needs to kill him in order to restore peace to both worlds. In one spine-chilling moment within her breathtakingly choreographed fight sequence with Ares, Diana rises from a fall, and virtually carries out her meteoric ascent, a symbolic assumption of her superhero status.<br/><br/>But in spite of the amount of physical tension and visual explosion, Jenkins balances the flavor by injecting humor and romance, utilizing them even in places where gripping action sequences are imminent. Chris Pine shines in his own moments, a remarkable feat for a character in a saga that seems to underscore women empowerment. There is a powerful moment where he grapples for words to ask for Diana's help to win the war; he practically breaks down, a stirring and moving scene to behold. Part of the film's colossal allure is its heart--it never loses it, doesn't intend to, and it grows to more awe-inspiring forms as it reaches a resonating, albeit predictable, resolution.<br/><br/>It is ironic to think that Diana Prince isn't human, but appears to be the most one, when compared with her colleagues in the looming 'Justice League' film. In the end, 'Wonder Woman' isn't a film free of blemishes as it still stumbles upon political truths it rarely gets justified, and minor expositions it doesn't seem interested to shed light on. But it has soul, humor, and wonder-- a narrative spectacle one seldom finds in a film of its sort."

","Too much of a pro war propaganda Film. A feministic one"
"maxmages","1","1","8","19 November 2018"," I have respect for Wonder Woman, but none for this movie.
","Black screen and a deep narration
Backstory and World Establishment for 10 minutes Mini Greek Mythology (here is more similar to Christianity)
And I'm honest I had to fight through the first 20 minutes of the movie I was about to get up 5 times and drive home. (Because the costumes are almost as awful as in ""God of Egypt."")
Well, I have to say the backgrounds are quite pretty but the back story is pretty clumsy and the music is too monotonous.
The film was clearly made just to destroy the Bechtel test, but I would like to ask why the Queen Hipólita was so naively written. Having heard the training instructions I've just gotten one head the movie is pretty dumb but only our main character is written with competence.<br/><br/>Seriously! All are incompetent and naive except for Princess Diana and that puts the film and its massage in the wrong light.<br/><br/>Even if I should just rate the movie as a movie, I can not say much good because I have seen and heard little good in this movie and the good things were not good enough.
The only positive things I want to mention is:
They gave Chris Pine the role that usually women in superheroes play movies with male heroes, I did not like it anyway but the idea was really thought through. Good job.
So I admit it was a nice idea to pack this whole in that scenario of the First World War. Instead of the second but the cut is editing dreadful and the CGI look FAKE.<br/><br/>Its back to the principle that many stories are used that come with the evaluation, of course, 20 years would be kept away from the battlefield so the 0 fight-experience and yes not discovered his powers.
But my biggest problem is the fact that Princess Diana will be denied fighting for as long as I'm not going to say what was in the comics or in the animated series and so on, because that's not the point at all. My problem just it's DUMP!<br/><br/>If I give birth to a child that is a demigod and I know the father will come back and visit her at some point, I train the child until the Super Saiyan-Mode so that my child can defend herself and is adequately competent enough later to take over the job as a monarch.
I also think it's pretty awful to still see films that look and are made exactly the same as they were 20 years ago without any improvement or real reason. This is backward development and as a movie fan I hate to see that. The story arc could be done better, as is the character arc in this movie. The fights are .... okay.<br/><br/>The film is just full of stupid decisions empty comments and people who have not thought through to the end. I'm a bit confused and why the movie gets such good reviews but maybe I'm just a minute active, but I can not sympathize with you. Serious the movie can go to hell.<br/><br/>So the movie is not even in ""the top 50 of the worst"" I've ever seen, but definitely in the top 3 of ""the movies that upset me the most.""<br/><br/>PS .: Wonder Woman - ""I believe in love.""
Seriously? There are days when I think people write such lines, just to irritate me."

"Mohican15","7","1","8","16 October 2017"," Certainly not without blemishes, but STILL, Very Good!
","One thing's for sure: there's A LOT to like here! <br/><br/>Let's face it: DC hasn't had good movies in the past few years! BATMAN V SUPERMAN, GREEN LANTERN and GREEN HORNET, but WONDER WOMAN, is up there with the likes of BATMAN BEGINS! It's like a much better version of CAPTAIN America 1 and there are quite a few similarities! <br/><br/>The story doesn't lag and keeps a strong and even pace, starting on the shores of Themyscira and continuing to London, ""The Frontlines"" and German-occupied France! <br/><br/>The time spent in Themyscira is pleasant enough with an absolutely adorable, young Princess Diana (Lilly Aspell) but it gets a little uncomfortable to watch when the likes of Robin Wright (""Jennie!"") and Connie Nielsen practice for war in their skimpy, leather war Armour as General Antiope and Queen Hippolyta. However this slightly unrealistic element does not matter since the story is pushed on by the arrival of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) and the German army. <br/><br/>From then on it's a real joy-ride! By this point in the film we have the REAL Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot and she shines as Diana! Not in a creepy way but, she's gorgeous! Her character's so optimistic and naive to the outside world. She hasn't even met the rest of the world but she still wants to help them and Gadot plays all these characteristics SUPERBLY! <br/><br/>The film is kept going with the killer cast BUT, also with the script and the directing. Allan Heinberg delivers a very well-written script. EVERY single character has back story that makes you really root for them. But the script makes this a film of many genres: it's a war movie, it's a romance, it's a comedy and yes, of course, it's a sci-fi! <br/><br/>Patty Jenkins REALLY does direct well and gets the best from her cast. Gadot is brilliant but not just her, Pine is as ALWAYS, ringing with charismatic charm and enthusiasm and his valiant war hero is a joy to spend time with. <br/><br/>Everyone else is on top form too! Diana and Steve's little ""Band of Brothers"" are all played really well and are laced with vital backstory! Even Pine's secretary, Etta, is played with real charisma by Lucy Davis. <br/><br/>However, the casting for Villain is not great. I do NOT think much of Danny Huston's acting abilities and he's rather poor as the Red Skull-like villain General Ludendorff. The character could have been played better by someone else! Seriously, he's like ""The Count"" from Sesame Street. Laughing like a bear and shooting comrades for no good reason... <br/><br/>Putting aside the rather pathetic Ares villain, most villainous acting is delivered by Elena Anaya as Dr. Maru. She is very good and really delivers as the psychotic chemist! <br/><br/>However, all these great characters (minus Ares and Ludendorff) must have story, and they certainly have a story. All the war and London scenes are written very well. As I said, this is also a ""war movie"" and it doesn't shy away from the horror of war, something that Diana really takes to heart and that's beautiful to see! <br/><br/>On to the war, the action in this film (apart from the end battle) is brilliant! It's gripping, well-choreographed and very enjoyable. However, it was unrealistic at times and all the sci-fi stuff sometimes made it lag BUT the action still kept on at an explosive pace and was ultimately enjoyable! <br/><br/>I also said this film is a romance and it IS! The romance between Trevor and Diana is beautiful to watch and Gadot and Pine share real acting chemistry! They really play the iconic wartime sweethearts! <br/><br/>All these good things: the acting, dialogue and even the music really push the story on wards to its finish and as I have stated, this film does have ""blemishes!"" <br/><br/>The ending battle with Ares was a huge disappointment for me, since I had enjoyed the film all the rest of the way through! It's SO unrealistic and DULL and a real shame since the rest of the story was so entertaining and gripping! I knew this movie would have a sci-fi element and was OK about that and though sometimes it got on my nerves I didn't mind, but the ending made it worse, much worse! <br/><br/>I know this makes WONDER WOMAN sound really bad but that's not what I mean. Apart from that part (and let's not forget it's story is written by Zack Snyder), it's a really enjoyable and fun film with a dynamite cast and enjoyable story. <br/><br/>Most, importantly, I DID enjoy it. The acting, action and most of the story. It is a good film! <br/><br/>I say ""Try it!"""

His acting skills are just not great, like you would expect for a movie with such a high budget. Gal Gadot is a nice girl to look at, that's for sure, but here also the acting wasn't that great. The different battle shots are way over the top, even if that's usual for superhero movies, and the CGI wasn't that great either. The story is also a bit long and boring.

","This first part doesn't contain spoilers. I'll tell you when it does.<br/><br/>The first thing I want to say is that DC focuses on special effects. You can like this or not, but in my opinion they focused too much on that and not enough on the story line. Also worth mentioning: the actress of wonder woman had to hit the gym before filming. She just looked too thin for a woman who has been trained all her life.<br/><br/>---NOT EXACTLY SPOILERS BUT SOME PEOPLE PREFER TO NOT READ IT <br/><br/>Wonder Woman has to adapt to the real world of course, but I think they did not do this well enough. Especially when you compare it to Thor, for example. She has some trouble with knowing when you can say something or not, or the fact that she's a woman and has fewer rights than men, but nothing more. She doesn't have to ask what some things are, except for a 'secretary', she isn't completely wondered by the environment: the advanced weapons, the buildings, even the clothes/armor. They could have done this a lot better.<br/><br/>---THE SPOILERS START HERE <br/><br/>What's the thing with Doctor Poison and Ludendorff? Doctor Poison, just that name is stupid. They looked like two childish adults who jokingly put a gas bomb into a room of people and start giggling behind the door. <br/><br/>Ares is a slim man with a mustache. Now I have to admit, I also like it. Ares doesn't have to look like a strong or powerful man of course, so why not a silly man with a mustache? But on the other hand, of course Ares has to look like a powerful man, because he is powerful. Besides, he can choose his own appearance. I know he probably doesn't want to stand out, but he could at least remove the mustache or gain some muscles when he is in that awesome suit.<br/><br/>And what was up with the issue about whether Diana gets trained or not? They had to either express this more or not at all. And because Amazons are supposed to be quite brutal, you'd expect them to train every woman on the island.<br/><br/>Also, why did Steve have to die? Of course those gas bombs had to be destroyed, but wasn't there another way? Couldn't he jump out of the plane and shoot at the same time when he's above water? Or better: just drop those bombs into the water. Or why did they let the plane fly anyway? Why not prevent that?<br/><br/>And of course some parts were decent, but they also somehow managed to mess it up shortly after that."

","I just finished watching the reboot of Captain America: The First Avenger. Whether you consider it a reboot or a rip-off; Wonder Woman is 100% inspired by the first Captain America movie and it uses very very little from the actual mythos of the Wonder Woman comics.<br/><br/>In this version of Wonder Woman, Steve Trevor is no longer a heroic soldier, but a spy - definitely influenced by what Hayley Atwell did with Peggy Carter. Chris Pine is very entertaining as Trevor and brings more life to the role than Lyle Waggoner had done in the TV series.<br/><br/>Instead of WWII (Captain America) the filmmakers went with WWI - like that really covers up that you took all your influence from the Cap movies.<br/><br/>Where Cap had the Howling Commandos - WW has a group of ragtag fighters who help her with her cause.<br/><br/>In both movies, the villain is going against the German high command. Danny Huston is not menacing though and is more of a caricature - where Hugo Weaving was incredible as the Red Skull. Both villain, of course, had a super scientist with them. Again Cap did it better - Toby Jones was much better as Dr. Zola and Dr. Poison was a weak character. In both movies, there is a super weapon that is being loaded onto a plane. Funny how there were no such planes in existence in WWI - but we had to imitate Cap. In both movies the plane is flown away and someone sacrifices themselves for the greater good.<br/><br/>Even though Wonder Woman took every single aspect from the Captain America movie (btw my favorite superhero series) it still was entertaining. Maybe because it had so many influences from a well loved movie, it gave it a comfortable feeling.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot was very good as Diana Prince and probably the best DC superhero performance next to Christian Bale and Christoper Reeves.<br/><br/>Chris Pine was on par with Hayley Atwell for one of the better supporting cast members in a superhero movie.<br/><br/>Where this movie does not match up is in the villain department. As mention before Danny Huston was not very menacing and Dr. Poison was a joke. But the worse part was Ares. I figured out who was Ares very early and it was no surprise, but it was not handled well. The other complaint is that throughout the history of Diana Prince, she is the strongest, most skilled and fastest of the Amazon warriors - but she in not a God - and in this movie they make her a God and now she can fly.<br/><br/>I would have given the movie a solid 8 to an 8.5 up until the final 15 minutes where Ares, the God mode and the flying brought the movie down. Overall I would recommend it and it was enjoyable - but if you feel comfortable it is because you have already seen it -- Captain America: The First Avenger."

","This is the first live-action Wonder Woman film, and as a result it has been hotly anticipated by both DC Comics fans as well as the general movie-going public. While not on the same level as the Dark Knight trilogy, this film is a solid and entertaining superhero movie that is much better than ""Batman v. Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad."" The film's plot is generally easy to follow and has some very visually ambitious set pieces, from the Greek island where Wonder Woman is from to a well-choreographed and fairly visceral depiction of trench warfare in World War I. Gal Gadot gives a good performance as Wonder Woman. The supporting cast is a bit less commanding, but still generally well-casted. The villains in the film are genuinely evil and are woven into the plot very well, but they are not particularly developed as characters by the script.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be a superhero film without action scenes, and the ones in ""Wonder Woman"" deliver. While they do not necessarily deviate from the overtly noisy, fairly neo-noir tone of action scenes in other DC Comics films, they are thrilling and fully engaging. Despite a fairly long running time of 141 minutes, the film's pacing is brisk and excellent. That said, there are some flaws to ""Wonder Woman."" The main criticism I have of the film pertains to the big finale, which unfortunately becomes fairly anti-climatic and begins to lose focus as it unravels. Additionally, the film seems to use a bit too much CGI at some points that some of its visual effects start to look a bit hokey. At the end of the day, ""Wonder Woman"" is an entertaining comic book film that should satisfy those looking for an action-packed time at the movies. Recommended. 7/10 <br/><br/>Note: I saw the film in IMAX 3D. While I would not say it is necessary, this film was worth the extra charge to see in that format. The film's visual effects and action scenes were enhanced by the larger screen and more powerful sound system and bass. The 3D was worthwhile as well, containing some 'in-your-face' effects (flying bullets, lighting, etc.) while also providing depth in other scenes."

"FabledGentleman","8","1","9","16 June 2017"," One of the best superhero movies yet
","Before i went into the cinema, i was thinking to myself that this film might be rated as high as it is, because it has a woman in the leading role and that it's also directed by a woman. You know, in these times where women feel they are underpaid in Hollywood. They probably are, but the point is, this kind of thinking leads peoples thoughts elsewhere.<br/><br/>Just like with the new Ghostbusters, a movie i thought was bad, it just didn't work. But somehow the makers of the film managed to get people to think it was because they hated black women or women in general, and that the haters were Trump supporters. Which of course were not the case, the movie was bad, plain and simple. It's pretty amazing that such an assemble of funny women can be so boring.<br/><br/>So just to be clear, i do not think of these things before i see a film, like many seem to do, i see the film for what it is, and could care less who acts in them or makes them.<br/><br/>So, ""Wonder Woman"" scores high almost everywhere, people are praising it for it's cast, for it's visuals, for it's storytelling. Well damn, i better go and see this movie asap then, which i did, bought myself a ticket on the premiere day in my country and now i just got back from the cinema.<br/><br/>In the last years i have not been too found of the DC universe movies, and it hurts me to the core that i feel like this. I feel Zack Snyder was not the right man for ""man of steel"" and ""Batman v Superman"". The movies are just effect bonanzas with weak plots and weak scripts.<br/><br/>I grew up reading batman and superman comics, it was a big part of my life as a kid. I also read He-man, M.A.S.K., Conan and HULK among many others. I loved comics, and still do. Marvel found a movie formula that works, where most of their films are good or great, and if you count the x-men universe, Logan is one of the finest superhero films of all time. Marvel just spew out one awesome film after the other, where DC seem to be tripping in the dark (Only counting the DCEU so far here). Another good example of this is ""Suicide Squad"".<br/><br/>But apparently, this is now about to change, because with ""Wonder Woman"", DC finally shows us that they can, and now I've regained some hope that ""Justice League"" actually can be good, and mostly because Joss Whedon has taken over, and he is going to do re-shoots, he is going to cut it his way and he has just hired Danny Elfman as the composer.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman wrote the best superhero theme of all time with ""Batman (1989)"", There is no comparison, it's just THE superhero theme. And Joss Whedon directed ""The Avengers"", which is one of the best superhero films i have ever seen. So yes, now i believe. To bad it took the destruction of two movies with two my favorite superheros to get to this, but anyways, here we are.<br/><br/>I got to praise Patty Jenkins for her work on this film, and as critics have already said, this might be a turning point for female directors in Hollywood, and as long as they make as good films as the men, of course they deserve same pay and same benefits, it's only logical. One thing is for sure, Patty Jenkins has made a far better movie than Zack Snyder managed to do.<br/><br/>At it's core ""Wonder Woman"" is sort of just another good guys vs bad guys film, where again the evil Germans is the latter. It can get tiresome, when this is all Hollywood can come up with in terms of bad guys, but in this case, it actually works. The way the story is told, and how the plot is executed, i didn't really think of it as just another USA with it's heroes beats up the evils of this world. Yes i know, it's suppose to be about the British in this film, but i noticed they sneaked in the American flag a few places, just to make sure we weren't fooled into thinking someone else made this film.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of heart, and it is executed with care, with good character buildup and a strong Gal Gadot at it's core, who carries this movie with ease. And i just got to admit, Gal is so easy to love, i mean, what a gorgeous woman she is. Absolutely incredibly beautiful, with towering charisma, and the camera loves her. I can't remember to have seen a woman with such a powerful screen semblance since Grace Kelly.<br/><br/>Well, anyways, Now that i got that off my chest, let's move on shall we.<br/><br/>The actions scenes in this film are there to build upon the story, not the other way around, and i hope DC continues this way, and not fall into the Zack Snyder trap again. The movie starts slowly, it takes it's time to let us get to know Diana, which is very important to understand her views and values, but when the big actions scenes finally arrive, they pack a heavy punch. The choreography is awesome, the fighting scenes are a pure joy to watch, and they are powerfully executed, as Diana slowly but steady learns her true powers over the course of the film, and we are right there, learning them with her.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" is indeed a spectacular movie, with fantastic visuals, strong performances, great photography, steady direction and a good script. What drags the film down is the plot, which is very predictable, but not a big deal really. This movie is solid fun, and i strongly recommend it.<br/><br/>The DC universe needed this movie more than anything."
"hjalsayegh","7","1","10","16 February 2020"," It's alright
","The movie is divided into three parts.<br/><br/>
First we see Diana as a child then as an adult training to be the best of the amazon warriors. This part is a little weird because when you think amazon warrior you don't think water nymph popping out of the sea to spread the message of LOVE AND PEACE.<br/><br/>
Second part Diana goes to London during WWI with a mission of spreading LOVE AND PEACE... by killing Ares the god of war, because obviously we start peace by spilling blood. Thankfully the fish out of water thing is quick and painless.<br/><br/>
Third part we are going to war and it's to bring LOVE AND PEACE by killing those on the German side.<br/><br/>
As preachy as this movie is it seems like what they're saying and what they're doing contradicts each other.<br/><br/>
In the end Gal Gadot is amazing in the role and you always got the sense that Wonder woman was someone larger than life, dignified and with her eyes on the prize. The movie however... well it was a bit on the cheesy side and the final boss battle more funny than dramatic but still it was an alright movie for a rainy day in."

Understandable as it's the only female superhero movie and directed by a female to boot. If you're the other half of the human population, tastes might differ. The best humor was already in the trailer. Wonder Woman didn't show greater skill than some of the other Amazons. There were a few cringe-worthy lines of dialogue delivered by Gadot.

","If you're liking special effects than this big screen version of Wonder Woman will fit your pistol. But for myself I much prefer what Lynda Carter did in the 70s on the small screen.<br/><br/>I'm not even sure comic book purists will not have criticisms because this one takes Wonder Woman back to World War I. As we know she was created just before our entry into that second World War and her reason for leaving the Paradise Island home was to offer her services to the Allies most specifically against Mr. Hitler.<br/><br/>In this one Steve Trevor played by Chris Pine washes ashore on the Amazonian populated Paradise Island and he's followed shortly by some invading Germans. Trevor is played by Chris Pine and he helps battle the invaders. <br/><br/>Not without losses do the Amazons repel the Germans, they give a good account of themselves with spears and arrows, on horseback and on foot.<br/><br/>Here Princess Diana the soon to be Wonder Woman decides to leave the island because the Greek God of war Ares is behind all the slaughter on the western front. A Deity that gets off on killing. That's who Israeli actress Gal Gadot playing Wonder Woman is after while Chris Pine has a more prosaic intelligence mission.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is a good action/adventure flick with the pyrotechnics fans crave, but I'll take Lynda Carter any old time."

Gal Gadot portrays the character beautifully and her relationship with Steve is very well developed. The character is exactly what you'd expect and she is pitted against a very interesting villain in the form of Dr. Meru. However the final act of the movie for me ruins it. The actions scenes are well choreographed and very well shot, however, the final fight with Ares is stupid and unneeded. Diana learns nothing throughout the movie and by the end is totally vindicated in all of her opinions. I find the last part featuring Ares to be such a poor way to conclude the plot, leaving a sour taste in my mouth."

Gal Gadot did a good job and so did Chris Pine with his own character.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film is the 3rd part when the battles happen. I just couldn't get into it.

Chris Pike also did very well, and as far as characters go, Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor are very good.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there was plenty that I didn't like about this movie. For example, I thought most of the characters were shallow and not developed well at all. Most of the villains in the movie seemed to have no motivations whatsoever. In other words, they were ""bad"" only because the script required them to be.<br/><br/>It was very hard for me to accept the dialogue. It seemed to have been written for a Saturday morning cartoon. I did my best to ignore what the characters were saying and just watched the visuals.<br/><br/>I was annoyed at the overuse of slow motion. Once or twice would have been fine, but seeing it over and over again was really tiresome.<br/><br/>At 141 minutes, this movie is too long. I would have preferred somewhere around 110 minutes instead. Superhero films are not supposed to be epics. The script was too weak to hold up for that long.<br/><br/>There were a lot of plot holes that never were answered. I won't mention them here because I want to avoid spoilers.

She has deep concern for humanity and so comes through time to save us, and then decides herself to go over the top of the trenches and slaughter countless German soldiers on the battlefield. Surely as someone with no preconceptions or bias she must see that there is good and bad on both sides and that the German foot soldiers are not the ones to blame, why not go straight for the Nazi high command and Hitler?<br/><br/>The enemy is set up to be interesting too, with some nasty villains to take care of including the dastardly Dr Poison, but the story never really goes in the right elaborate direction to make the most of it<br/><br/>Instead we get a twist ending and a very standard superhero boss fight<br/><br/>A reasonable movie but did not meet by high expectations of it unfortunately"

Sure, it was interesting to have a class of woman superfighters. But, it ultimately just ended up as a big fight scene which reminds me of how much I hated the 2009 Star Trek movie (and the one after it) for the same reason. I would never recommend this movie to anyone in the right mind. Watch a comedy instead!<br/><br/>Some have easily praised the role of Gadot and said the film was ""feminist"" because it featured a woman as the protagonist. But, she has a male love interest (Steve Trevor, played by Chris Pine). This film, despite being set in a war zone does not attempt, from what I remember to be seriously anti-war, although it brings up the ""science can be evil"" theme, of course, with Isabel Maru, also known as Doctor Poison, played by Elena Anaya, as one of the villains. Some will say that this film has, within it, themes of the preservation of information.

","After a Nazi plane crashes near the land of the Amazons and the pilot is saved by a young warrior wannabe, they venture into the middle of the World War in her attempt to kill Ares, the god of war whom she thought was responsible for everything. Young Diana will soon find out that the outer world is much different than hers and as nothing is as simple as they seem, a journey of self-discovery but also self-education will be taken in parallel with the one of mankind's salvation.<br/><br/>We follow the story of Diana since she was a little child as she aspired to fight together with the girls from her land and her evolution to Wonder Woman, although this name isn't used even a single time. The story is unfortunately average or even below average. It manages to tell a pertinent and interesting story but lacks complexity. It's way too linear and predictable for my taste, almost every single problem being solved with the blink of an eye. It lacks drama and emotion and although it has a few moments of romance, they are also unable to do much. What you do get is a lot of spectacular action which is impressive and thrilling but until it also becomes predictable. It is worth mentioning that they've taken a serious approach regarding this movie, or at least this is the impression that the movie tried to leave, but the characters are not quite helping in this direction.<br/><br/>Speaking of characters, they are also not very well thought or might be too well thought, it's quite hard to tell, but what I can tell for sure is that they are not very likeable, credible or even well developed and described. The best one I find it to be Chris Pine's as he manages to be much more credible and less annoying than Gal Gadot's childish and immature one. Another black ball here would be that she insists on keeping it like this way until the end when she suddenly decides to grow up and do something worthy of her status. Not to mention the ""squad"" that joins them in their quest and they do almost nothing useful along the way. I don't want to bring spoilers here so that's all that I will say.<br/><br/>In terms of visuals everything looks good but nothing spectacular. I liked the way the fighting scenes are filmed and presented, with the surreal angles used, but unfortunately there isn't much to be impressed here. One or two explosions now and then, a slow-motion bullet dodged or blocked and that's about it. I'm not saying that it's a bad thing, especially as it works for the movie in terms of seriousness but I felt that the highly CGI-ed final fight was left there alone, like it didn't belong to the picture.<br/><br/>To sum things up, I have to say that I'm disappointed by this movie, especially as the hype that surrounded it made me have high expectations. Even if it weren't for them, the movie would still have felt average. I like this type of superhero movies but you have to have a good story to make it all work. You also have to create great characters and as I mentioned before, Chris' was the only one worth mentioning, or better said, the only one worth empathizing with. It's a shame that they weren't able to do more with the material that they had. And to make things clear, this review is coming from a superhero movie lover, not a Marvel fan or a DC Comics hater."

","For the modern superhero genre (where the average is still really good), this rides the middle of the average line. The action is well crafted, almost as if Snyder himself had directed it. Despite this, the movie still feels like it plateaus early and never peaks, leaving more to be desired. It also doesn't help that I feel Chris Pine is a fairly wooden actor."

","Woman Woman was cast very well and the scenes are well done but the story line was complete and utter garbage. In my opinion, story is the most important thing a movie can have and in this movie the story was no good. Most of the story is easy to understand but there are a few times where the story makes no sense. For example, the villain: I get that the god of war likes war but why is he just playing politician and enjoying the bloodshed from the sidelines. If I were a nigh invulnerable god of war, I would be out fighting and reveling in the destruction instead of helping the war end. The historic moments of the film are good but few. In fact the movie could have been set in WWII or another war and not much would change. The actors of this movie are great and Gal Gadot does a spectacular job playing Wonder Woman. The directing was also good and the scenery was beautiful but the writers did not do a great job. I am worried for the next Wonder Woman movie and for the future of superhero movies."
"Badmoviessuck","6","0","4","28 December 2018"," Captain Ameri...I mean Wonder Wamen sucks
","This movie is fine.
Of all the DCEU movies i have watched this is the best one.
But it has major flaws that instantly make the movie a 7/10.
When i watched this movie i was about to give it a 9/10 cause i liked it and enjoyed it but when i think about it then it's another bland superhero film.<br/><br/>
CHARACTERS
The characters aren't that good.
Diana is mediocre she has an character arc halfway through the movie and then that character arc stops cause of the stupid Final Act.
She has a desire and we get to know who she is and where she grew up and all that but she dosen't have a good villain nor dose she change after the event.
Steve is also kinda bad but he is better than Diana.
I like how they give the side characters some personality but it dosen't matter cause they barely get any screen time.<br/><br/>WAMEN
One small thing why don't they treat Diana like a woman in this movie.
And what i mean by that is that during WW1 Women weren't treated the same as men they didn't get to vote and most of them stayed home and did house work and all that.
Diana goes into a meeting for men and no-one cares they cared for awhile but then they just let her stay there and they didn't even bother to have guards to escort her out cause she was breaking the laws and also they just let her go and fight the war even do Womens weren't allowed to fight the war.
They just let her do all of this stuff and no-one even bothers to stop her.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
The villain is pretty bad he gets no development whatsoever and he has a pretty stupid ideology that war can make a human improve and that's why he want's to have an endless war like Ares wanted.
But didn't he want to end the war in that one scene were he said that we can beat the Germans and that we don't need to sign the peace treaty? Maybe i'm wrong.
And also it dosen't matter how you try to spin on the destroy the world motive it's still a bad motive nonetheless and they should have atleast try to make the motive more believable cause he just said his motive in that one scene and that motive never gets developed.<br/><br/>ACTION
The action is decent at best, bland and over the top at worst.
In Act 1 when we see the amazonians fight it's so CGI and over the top it's kinda funny.
And it's always that way.
The CGI and VFX are always bad in these movies even though the movies have pretty high budget.<br/><br/>FINAL ACT
The final act was the worst part in this.
Diana kills Ludendorff and the war continues and we have this good scene were Steve says that there isn't this big bad guy that needs to be defeated to end all wars it's how are beliefs are that makes this war continue.
It was a very good scene but then Ares literally shows up and tries to kill Diana and it becomes a mCindless DC action movie.
This movie could have been good if not for the final act which ruined everything cause after Ares is killed the war ends so Diana was right all along.<br/><br/>VERDICT
This movie is overrated and i don't know why people like bad movies these days.
But this is the best DCEU movie"
"aadishah","4","0","2","28 December 2018"," Downright torture
","I honestly do not see why many people and many websites cite this to be the best DC movie, it isn't even close. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was so much better and actually had a decent story, people hated on it. I expected so much out of this movie after the hints in Batman v Superman, but... I just cannot like this. DC has always had terrible action sequences and this movie seems to be an epitome for that (i would exclude Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight series). The music clearly said that Hans Zimmer had left, it wasn't even close to his scores, but honestly, it was not even close to bad and was probably the best part about the movie. Rupert Gregson Williams has done a great job with this one and even better with Aquaman. I really hated Diana's character but Gal Gadot did real good. There were a few good, funny moments, but these moments were overused and this is one of the reasons it turned out bad. Diana going on and on about Ares was downright annoying. The beginning and the middle part were fine. But honestly though, this was probably the worst DC movie I've seen."
"maciek-bos12","4","0","4","27 October 2018"," History distorted to the max
","Don't usually write reviews but felt I had to share what was wrong with this highly acclaimed picture in my opinion.<br/><br/>Where to begin? First of all have the makers of this film, not read a history book ever in their lives. Though the idea of World War One being a product of evil god sounds interesting, have they forgotten that there was a Second World War much bloodier, where many more civilians died. Just the message of the film that that's ""the war to end all wars"" seems bizarre. Ww must of had a nap between 1939-1945 guys<br/><br/>The idea that ludendorf was some evil dictator is a bit stupid, Germany was ruled by a group of generals by 1916, pin-poiting Ludendorff as the evil one, doesn't do justice considering Schlieffen, Von Molte and the rest.<br/><br/>Also generally the idea that Germans are the evil ones isn't really as persuasive as during World War Two. Ww1 was an imperialistic War where both sides had relatively equal moral standards (both used mustard for goodness sake), saying the British where the good guys, doesn't really make too much sense.<br/><br/>In addition doesn't make much sense that the civilian woman is in the British trenches and that she speaks german. They are in the western part of Belgium where French is spoken. Writers tried to show that Germans aren't all evil but they've done it in a very silly way.<br/><br/>The end is just hilarious, I was laughing out loud. I won't go into depth with the final scene and the idiotic choice of the villain, but boy no mention of American intervention in ww1, when everyone is celebrating the end of ww1. Kinda disrespectful to all the soldiers who died in that war if you ask me.<br/><br/>A four is only scraped by the acting, the script and gal gatod, who is Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Yeah I know that people gonna be like, but this is a work of fiction, not a documentary, but this film certainly shapes the opinion on the of ww1 one way or the other, let's stick with the basic facts to write the story"

"kurovera","6","0","1","28 July 2018"," Could have been better.
","Filmography - 4/5
An easy score given the time and budget a large production company had for this film. There were bits here and there that were less than ideal but given it's 2 1/2 hour runtime there's a little room for leeway.<br/><br/>Plot - 3/5
There could have been so much more to this story or could have been a shorter film. But with such a simple plot and little evidence of any co-occurring events, it leaves the audience guided down a paved street with nothing to distract from the somewhat one-dimensional narrative. <br/><br/>Character - 3/5
Some hit and misses. While many say that Diana's character is representative of the island she comes from there is a lot to be desired in the movies ability to show this. There is no excuse for her lack of social graces, or her inability to communicate with others appropriately, or even her lack of forethought. Surely being what can be considered royalty and of a warrior society, even on an isolated island as she was, still requires dealing with general politics and disagreements, learning tactics and dealing with differing opinions. <br/><br/>Steve is a pessimistic realist counterbalance to Diana's optimistic naïveté, understanding the facts of war from hands-on experience. While being a significant part of the film, most of his screen time was spent reacting to Diana's actions. His actions, in the end, were heroic and human, though with a superhero next to him there was probably a better option. <br/><br/>The side characters - despite their small appearances and lacking background - can sometimes come across as more interesting than the main characters, and for a superhero movie that's unimpressive.<br/><br/>Soundtrack - 4/5
It's a DC movie with a large budget, thankfully with someone who knows music on their side.<br/><br/>Enjoyment - 3/5
To be fair, it took me two times to finish this movie, the idea and filmography were great, the actual end result had room for improvement. It was drawn out, simple and one-dimensional with a lacking plot and no interest in world building.<br/><br/>Overal - 6/10
A very standard Hollywood film, even with superheroes. I wonder how many days it was from Steve and Diana meeting till the end, a whirlwind romance of no explanation, seemingly for exciting power-ups at the death of their love. If she had not loved Steve, or if it was any of the others, would Diana have lost in the end?"
"nightroses","4","0","4","23 July 2018"," So awkward, as I was a fan of Wonder Woman
","I used to watch ""Wonder Woman"" TV series as a kid, and found her inspiring. A tough female superhero was a good role model for a girl in the 80's until Helen Slater's Supergirl and animated She-Ra. Before then there was Wonder Woman, although now as an adult, the earlier show looks really funny and quite sexist now. So I looked forward to watching ""Wonder Woman"" 2017. I was certainly in awe of the island Themyscira where Wonder Woman (Diane) grew up among the Amazons of legend. It was a very magical place like something out of a feminist sci-fi utopia novel. The beautiful and isolated world is interrupted when a WW1 plane arrrives and crashes into the sea. Diane rescues the pilot, Steve, and a load of Germans on a boat emerge through the same mist and all hell breaks lose. The Amazons manage to defeat the Germans, arrows and swords better than guns! Much of the film didnt make a lot of sense. They gave WW a pair of gold wedge heeled boots, a Roman gladiator style metal suit of armour in red and blue colours, with a golden eagle. The tiara has a star on it. The precious god-slaying sword was easily retrieved and supposed to be the ultimate weapon against the enemy of humanity. She agreed to go with Steve to his world, and they get on a boat and sail off. They end up in smoky London of WW1. Wonder Woman spent so long in a London boutique and being childishly silly, then handing over her sword and shield to a secretery, then this debate about secreteries being ""slaves"". The scenes of WW at the Frontline was pretty cool, but I was greatly disappointed with the rest. David Thewlis turned out to be a big surprise and Steve's decision to sacrifice himself the way he did was a bit ""rushed"". The film relied heavily on CGI to impress and not much on storyline or script. The characters seemed a bit wooden and even Wonder Woman came across as a bit too naive. It's as if the film makers forgot that she's meant to be an Amazon and a demi goddess."
"pkneer","2","0","5","22 July 2018"," How Did This Get A Rating So High?
","I finally saw WW and was expecting good things since the high ratings. But I was greatly disappointed. Too many things wrong with this film. The script above all was very weak and so many aspects were predictable and even for a comic book story, just too unbelievable things would turn out the way it did. Acting was acceptable but was stunned at how poorly Gadot acted. I kept seeing rave reviews but just didn't see it - her performance was stiff and felt she was reading cue cards just off camera. Things fell apart pretty fast as we meet the women on her home island. Not sure how we can meet women raised their entire life on one island with so many different accents being used. How in the world did Diana acquire a French accent? Very strange and at times was laughable. By far the worst part were the special effects. For a normal movie, it was average - but considering it was a comic book action film, it was just horrible. Nothing looked even remotely realistic - like a poor job of Photoshopping. Why DC makes their big fights scenes dark and hard to see is beyond me. Don't buy the hype, this is an average film at best."

"MVictorPjinsiste","6","0","4","19 May 2018"," Okay, In Spite of Some Irritants
","Let's just say right off the bat that WW isn't my favorite comic book hero: Questionable hybrid between bunny-suited tart and a feminist (as viewed by a conservative writing team), with dull powers, dull story arcs, dull supporting cast and dull enemies. At best she was Superman with breasts - at worse, she was also Superman with breasts.<br/><br/>When Gal Gadot was announced as the next WW, my first instinct was indifference, then when I saw her in BvS I regretted the occasion to have a real colossal woman to play the role, you know, with muscles and breasts. But with this movie I warmed up to Gadot, who plays her role without a shadow of arrogance, and that marvellous voice of her. Her presence, along with DC/Snyder having cleared a bit the mess that was her origins, was one of the good things about this movie.<br/><br/>Another one was to set said origins in a WWI setting, less overdone than the WWII one, but, alas, they couldn't do better than create ""WWI nazis"" to make Germans the bad guys again instead of the would-be victims of an ancient deity's manipulations. The plight of English soldiers is, it seem, easy to empathize when compared to the Germans' treatment as half-animals. Was that another Kosher Hollywood swipe at Germany?<br/><br/>And since we're there, did we really need another American in the de facto lead role? How come he was calling the shots in an English setting? Are we to the point where the US public couldn't care less about a movie if the main hero isn't a Yank, even if the action takes place in medieval times, for exemple? That being said Chris Pine did a great job, a bit at the expense of the titular character, and he was certainly more memorable than the other sidekicks.<br/><br/>Another good point were the action scenes, where DC is finally getting on par with Marvel in this rather important part of a super-hero flick, except that they are rather one-sided and have this irritating ""bullet time"" slo-mo switch that passes off as ""super-speed"". This was counter-balanced by the rather poor scenario, where everything is telegraphed miles in advances. Humor is subtle. Photo and music is okay.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is part of DC's getting up to Marvel's incontested cinematographic supremacy (along with BvS), against pretty much all odds as predicted disasters were common in the elaboration of a WW franchise. But here, it's clearly a step in the right direction."

","""Wonder Woman"" was received with high praises from critics, complementing the presence of a female-centric superhero movie. While there certainly is ambition into making this film, the story that it evolves around is just another generic ""superhero fights a forgettable villain"". The film was also surrounded by social movements and my recommendation is to watch the movie from your own perspective and make your own judgement.<br/><br/>The film centers on Diana Prince, known as Wonder Woman, and her initial training in becoming a fierce Amazon warrior. The daughter of Hippolyta lives on the island Themyscira, a secluded paradise inhabited by women. Their whole idyllic way of life is disrupted when American pilot Steve Trevor crashes on the island. We later find out from him that outside of the island, there is an ongoing war, The Great War, that is consuming mankind. The golden heart princess sets off into London together with the pilot to stop the threat and fulfill her true destiny. The film tries to hide the story's plainness with a villainous twist, but ultimately is turns out like any other film of the genre.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is the perfect representation of Wonder Woman and does terrific in the action sequences. Chris Pine performs great as pilot Steve Trevor adding a lot of comical effect to the movie. The scenes with Gadot and Pine are especially great, as they are lighthearted and delightful.<br/><br/>The script has a lighter tone than regular movies from the DC universe and it can be seen that DC is trying to change their style to better accommodate the general audience.<br/><br/>The film's score was very good, in particular the main theme song, it really made you believe you were in the midst of the Amazonian people. This is something that's been missing from recent superhero movies, not having a suitable theme, a theme that could be recognized anywhere. Rupert Gregson-Williams did an excellent job and I hope he will continue on this path moving forward.<br/><br/>""Wonder Woman"" is one of DC's finest works soaring at the box-office, but in my opinion it doesn't stand up to the high praises its been given. In the end, it still felt like it missed the excitement of a well constructed superhero movie."

","Given how disastrous things had been going for DC prior to this film's release, with abysmal films such as Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad, expectations here were rock bottom. Imagine the surprise when the critics began raving over this one. I can honestly say this was one of the best surprises of 2017 in movies. While in the previous films Superman was turned into an emo and Batman into a murderer, Wonder Woman is exactly what we'd like out of a movie hero; determined, powerful, but always still learning. Gal Gadot's performance was great, establishing herself as one of the breakthrough stars of the year. The other performances by Robin Wright and Chris Pine were pretty good as well. One of the most surprising things was how it managed to be dark without going overboard. It's darker than most comic book movies, dealing with things like mass murder of civilians, but it doesn't try too hard like BvS did. Now, there are some downsides. If you know your comic book movies, you'll see that the climax and ending were ripped straight out of Captain America: First Avenger. They are essentially the same scenes. While Ares is definitely an improvement over Eisenberg's Luthor and Leto's Joker, DC still hasn't gotten the villains down yet. The idea behind him is cool, but the way he acts toward Wonder Woman is quite similar to how Joker acted toward Batman in The Dark Knight. Still, this is by far the best DCEU film so far, and one of the most surprising movies of the year. It also set plenty of records for women in filmmaking, including highest grossing movie directed by a woman. That's especially good because the more records that get taken away from 50 Shades of Gray, the better. In all seriousness, this was a massive step in the right direction for DC, and one of the best comic book movies in recent years."

","I liked Batman v Superman - it had some darker themes and seemed a bit grittier than what Marvel has been pumping out (with the exception of newer movies like DeadPool and Logan). I was expecting something a bit more shallow from this movie but found the characters to be endearing and the fact that they kill off some of them makes for emotional moments. I don't know how close this was to Wonder Woman's character from the comics, I don't remember her having the ability to smash through buildings. Some of the CGI gets to carried away. The slow mo action scenes were better than the scenes of her jumping really fast all over. But it was all forgivable and didn't take me out of the story."

","I'm not generally into the superhero movie genre, but I gave this one a shot because I'd heard a lot about it. I walked away with the impression that this was a pretty standard superhero movie. It had all of the same flaws I see in move movies in the genre; the plot was pretty predictable, dialogue was cliche, etc. The rating IMDB gave seems a bit overly generous to me, and I'd be surprised if that wasn't related to the narrative (i.e. feminist) that accompanied this movie. <br/><br/>Overall, if you're into superhero movies you'll probably like this one but it certainly isn't anything exceptional that'd warrant someone who isn't into superhero movies to give it a shot. <br/><br/>For the record, I don't recall the plot being overwhelmed by feminist sentiment... I think it was just the perception, that it's the first female superhero movie, that gave birth to the idea that this movie is intended to be some sort of 'rebellion against the patriarchy'."

","The title character aka Princess Diana (Gal Gadot) grows up in the hidden, mythical island of Themyscira which is inhabited only by female warriors whose values are similar to those in Greek mythology. Diana is later brought into the ""other world"" during World War I and works with Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), a military captain. The two have similar goals but with very different perceptions of what is happening.<br/><br/>The beginning third of the film is superb. The Amazon island is idyllic and the other-worldly cultural perspective of its inhabitants is fascinating. There is also great amusement and enjoyment when Diana enters the ""normal"" world where her wiser Amazon outlook is very out-of-place.<br/><br/>The second third of the film is quite good as well but sadly, things deteriorate by the final third. The mythology that was so welcome in the beginning gets jumbled and confusing in the concluding segment. The final disintegration is guaranteed after a major decision is made. It is not just eye-rollingly hoaky and unbelievable; it's not even comprehensible.<br/><br/>Gadot and Pine are likeable and certainly good-looking but they are not always up to par for lead roles. There are times their performances come off as weak though they are good for most of the movie. Overall, it's too bad the film's great beginning went so far downhill by the end."

","I recently, quite belatedly, watched the film ""Wonder Woman"" directed by Patty Jenkins and distributed by Warner Brothers. In the following I will reference itemized aspects of the film and give an individual score (on a 1-10 form) for each.<br/><br/>Dialogue<br/><br/>The dialogue was cheesy at moments, however, maintained emotion through a majority of it. This cheesy nature normally occurs during attempted one-liners during battle. These phrases ended up sounding much worse than how they were attended to sound. Other than those few moments, the dialogue kept emotion vivid and was convincing. Overall ""Writing"" score: 7/10<br/><br/>Acting<br/><br/>The acting was superb. This to be expected with such a large budget being available for casting. The delivery was smooth and convincing. My only critique is that the delivery was sometimes overdramatic. This added to a further cheesy quality about some parts of the film. Overall ""Acting"" score: 9/10<br/><br/>Cinematography<br/><br/>The shots were very bland. Focus, lighting and tracking was good but at the sacrifice of originality. There was slow-motion panning, quick panning, and quick cutting. It is pretty standard for this style of production. Overall ""Cinematography"" score: 7/10<br/><br/>Plot<br/><br/>The plot was very expository. Such was a focus and its primary objective. However, there was a bit of conflict in the end which acted as a slight motivation. That conflict, though, was quickly obliterated to finish the movie with the protagonist achieving utter victory -- leaving no intensity. There was little tension throughout due to the ultimate power of Wonder Woman and the relative weakness of literally everyone else (other than the aforementioned final boss. Overall ""Plot"" score: 6/10<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>It was a good movie. Certainly when compared to previous ""DC"" endeavors. Quality film with some cheesy bits and quick pacing. Overall score: 29/40"

","The interview is not meant to throw shade on the director, who likely tried to do the best job with limited resources...well I tell myself that. I've been a fan of Wonder Woman since high school...that was 20 odd years ago. <br/><br/>Let me start off by saying your main character should never have a bad rep in real life...especially when portraying someone that upholds truth and justice. That being said, while I love Gadot's accent, the actual woman puts me off in that her role in the IDF made her top consideration for this project...WAIT WHAT? <br/><br/>Yeah, that's right. the IDF, the army that brutalizes the young, the old and the infirm in Palestine. Wonder Woman and the amazons are meant to protect mankind, yet we see their main fight against the Germans...back to Israel again and the injustices committed against the jewish nation. We never get a break from this story. We see you inserted an Israeli actress...playing the heroine. The movie was reminiscent of a ""what the evil germans did to us"" pamphlet and how Israel rises above. <br/><br/>Hollywood is run by Zionists, this is a prime example. It's a pity though, this movie could have really been something great had it a more believable heroine. 3 stars solely for Chris Pine's performance."

","Gal Gadot plays the title role in this retelling of the super hero's origins and first encounters with humans. Raised to be a super warrior on an island of Amazons, fearless Gadot trains with the expectation of one day fighting the god Ares, who is thought by the Amazons to come back one day and kill all the humans and Amazons on the planet. When a soldier (played by Chris Pine) crashes his plane near the Amazons' island, his story of a great and terrible war happening all over Earth is interpreted by Gadot that this is the doing of Ares. Gadot follows Pine into the world of humans where her kind heart will be overwhelmed with the duality of humans (their savage and loving nature).<br/><br/>At first, Pine helps Gadot blend in with the crowd, trying to ease her away from what he considers her insane mission of going to the front line to seek Ares and kill the god of war. But no one can tame her spirit; and when the innocent are suffering, Gadot's disguise comes off and Wonder Woman comes out in all her glory.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Wonder Woman"" is the scene when Gadot is in the trenches with the soldiers. Upon hearing of civilians trapped behind enemy lines, she shrugs off her coat and goes into No Man's Land alone, fully dressed in her Wonder Woman armor. Beautiful, exciting, and dramatic, she charges forward ready to kick some serious enemy ass.<br/><br/>Stripped down to its basic essence, this is a love story between two very likeable characters.

"derbo73","5","0","3","22 December 2017"," Lame and uninspired
","I am not going to criticize the dusty concept of Wonder Woman or the story as it is quite true to the original comic books. I am only very tired of seeing another movie where a superhero fights Nazis. A felt 50% of all super hero movies are against Nazis...this is truly becoming very old. The Nazis are always depicted the same way, with crazy scientists, megalomanianiac generals andtotally incompetent foot soldiers.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes of the movie show the story of the Amazons and their antagonist Ares, the childhood of Diana and contain a lot of talking among the Amazons about whether Ares is ever going to find them or not. A british soldier shows up and has to be saved by Diana from a bunch of itiot Nazi soldiers. Then we have some awkward scenes and dialogues between Diana and the soldier Steve Trevor that clearly aim at the fact that Diana has never before seen a male human, let alone half naked. In reverse Steve is also taken off-guard by the barely clad and beautiful Diana. In the press critics wrote how well this movie deals with issues like feminism and the depiction of the amazons not being pure sexual objects. Well, I want to disagree, there is no way to do that in a movie that is about half-naked warrior women. It could have been much worse, but I don't think that this is an aspect the movie should be praised for.<br/><br/>After almost an hour of runtime Diana and Steve enter London and society. All of a sudden Diana turns into a clumsy and helpless girl that can't find her way around modern society. I think she would suffer from some sort of culture shock (like running into carts on the street) but she would not stubbornly insist on hunting down Ares with her sword in her hand while facing so many, quite obviously important, men around her. She has a mission and she is without fear, but she isn't ignorant or dumb. She would notice that things outside of her island have changed dramatically and that she would have to learn and get by with this world and it's inhabitants, instead of ignoring them and trying to find Ares alone right on the spot. Her behaviour during these scenes is totally unbelievable to me.<br/><br/>The movie rumbles on and starts building up an adventuring group to help her on her task. These sidekicks turn out to be totally useless and incompetent guys, that are ought to be funny, but are annoying most of the time. During the entire movie they are no help at all, instead they are a burden to Diana as she feels responsible to prevent them form getting themselves killed.<br/><br/>After a lengthy intermezzo at the Nazi castle, where Diana carries a longsword ""hidden"" below her evening dress in a way that makes my back hurt and wonder how the blade adapts itself to her body curves, we enter the showdown after almost two and a half hours. Ares turns out to be a british Lord with a mighty mustache trying to create a better world by destroying the existing one. The death of Steve unleashes the full powers of Diana and she defeats the God of War pretty effortlessly. The surviving useless sidekicks and Diana take a photo to remember the day and the movie is finally over.<br/><br/>I have seen nothing new in this flick. No new aspects of super heroism, no extraordinary acting (although Gal Gadot is quite good, just her role isn't), no interesting or creative plot or adversaries. It's the tenth warm-up of an old recipe and just there for the sake of having a Wonder Woman movie in the repetoire. Humans in the film are just decoration or cannon-fodder, its actually a duell of Diana and Ares stretched out painfully over more than 2 hours.<br/><br/>All in all I think this is a quite bad movie as it is dull, uninspired and flat on all levels of film making. It is not even popcorn cinema as it is too long and has too many boring scenes for that. To be fair I would give it 5 points but never 7 or more."

","As many others here have stated, I'm also at a loss to explain why this was so highly touted. It was an average movie at best and I found myself at times looking at the clock wondering when it was going to be over? I actually found BvS to not be AS bad as others have stated and I enjoyed it more than this movie. Going into this movie with the hype that it out-shined BvS, and now with the flop that was Justice League (haven't seen it and will only watch it when it comes to my library), I was stoked to see just how much better this movie was. <br/><br/>Yes, it had it's funny moments, but the ""sexual tension"" between WW and Steve were awkward at best, especially the ""pool"" scene. I found it forced, and not even funny. There were other scenes that were funny and made me laugh, but overall, it felt ""fake"", especially on the island, and that's due to the CGI that just were a major distraction. And the action scenes probably could have done without the ""Matrix"" slo-mo. That has been overdone to death now and it just isn't effective. <br/><br/>The writing was sub-par at best. The dialogue at times just didn't fit and the overall story arc just didn't really satisfy me in the least.

","This movie is so hyped that i was actually thrilled to finally see it. It was dissapointing at the least. Ater the batman saga, DC just make the one after the other garbage movie where the action is over the top, the oneliners are painfully bad and where there is no character with a rich personality.<br/><br/>This movie has 1 big pro, that the main character is a woman, that has been done in series like Jessica Jones and Buffy the Vampire Slayer but we havent seen it in recent dc or marvel movies.
That said, it doesnt really make the story and action scenes better. <br/><br/>Spoiler: 
1. The first battle on the beach where trained soldiers enter through the magic dome of the island. On the beach the Amazones shoot arrows without looking to kill hardened soldiers with 1 arrow, while bullets miss. This is just so silly to watch that it is distracting to take the movie serious at all. <br/><br/>2. Wonder Woman is born on an Island where there are no men, no technology or any resemblance with the world. When she comes into the ""real"" world she doenst act too surprise by everything she sees and takes the leadership right away without really knowing what is going on. How can we, the audience, really get emotional en psychological connected with this when we cannot emphatize.<br/><br/>3. The final battle.. Since rocky its so played out to first let the main character get beaten so easily and than recover, by an emotional event, and take revenge.. We dont want to see that anymore. It takes all the exitement away and makes the scene forgetable and boring.<br/><br/>In my opinion this movie get way too much credits and doesnt take the audience seriously.

"shayanek","2","0","3","18 December 2017"," The wasted chance of a masterpiece.
","Wonder Woman is the result of very little work on how the comics presents the character and too many unnecessary facts. The movie, unlike other superhero movies, didn't have the same purpose: to bring action and show the adventures that superheros go through. Instead, it shows issues concerning historical facts, like women's right to the vote, just to send a message that isn't what the movie follows, what unfortunately could make the film an over-two-hour boring experience.
The film starts with the beginning of everything: Diana lives in Themyscira with the Amazons, with no contact with men. One day, a man who's escaping from the Nazis penetrates into the island, and (no surprise) is saved from drowning by Diana. From there on, she will be dragged everywhere by Steve, who uses her help to defeat the Germans. Some scenes were supposed to be funny by joking about Diana's innocence, like when she tries on some dresses and asks how women could fight a war wearing that. In that regard, the film succeeds but also fails at times - some jokes are just cringy. 
The movie takes place in the UK in the context of World War I, and that is, for me, its biggest letdown: Wonder Woman, a super strong hero, fights mostly against humans - soldiers in war and their guns. No need to say those scenes are, at most, interesting for the special effects, when she is in the trenches. On the other hand, there are no super villains yet for her to combat and give us the big emotion (as expected) of watching a DC movie. The final fight and the revelation happen at the end, which I found a very nice way to end the movie, with a well elaborated conversation between Diana and her god brother, who intends to lead humanity to do what he believes to be their fate: chaos and destruction. However, the movie, which throughout the past 2 hours had explored a romance between Diana and Steve, gave her a reason to fight for the humans, since she was in love with one (even though the sole purpose of Zeus creating the Amazons was for them to protect mankind). And, at that point, I could only be very sorry for Hollywood weakening such an icon of bravery. The feminine character is, unlike Batman, Superman, etc once more, portrayed as a compassionate helper rather than a strong protagonist."

So Wonder Woman was pretty much an expected by-the- numbers action movie. Most of the film felt like padding scenes. The majority of the runtime seemed to be filled with pointless exposition scenes, resulting in the film as a whole to feel pretty long, and tedious to sit through at points. The setup especially took way too long to tell and suffered the most. The action scenes ranged from just OK to ridiculous. The music and few seconds of slo-mo were unfitting and really took me out of the movie. However, the one thing I absolutely loved about this was the set design and locations by Aline Bonetto. Each scene was incredible to look at and very believable. In the end, if I actually liked superhero movies (DC or Marvel) I probably would have liked this more.

"annonymouscritic","7","0","4","18 November 2017"," The first triumph for DC in years, but it still has flaws.
","DC have not been doing well at all in recent years. Sure, in 2017 we got The Lego Batman Movie and this. But DC still finds a way to screw everything up (if Justice League wasn't enough to prove that for you then I don't know what will). Wonder Woman is certainly good, but it is no where near close to a cinematic masterpiece like all critics are saying (92% on Rotten Tomatoes is absolute tripe). The story as far as I'm aware is the same as in the comics so there's nothing to really say other than: Diana lives in sealed off Greek land, WW1 American spy crashes there and Diana saves him, the man and Diana go to try and stop WW1 and kill ''Ares'' the God of war (according to Diana). Now, I've seen some badass slow motion shiz from Zack Snyder, but this movie kicks the badassery up to whole new level. The action scenes aren't really the main focus until the middle of the movie and whilst that's a little disappointing when it's considered an action movie, at least we have time for the movie to give us Diana's backstory as well as some exposition. This surprised me at first because I never would've expected a modern DC film to do this after having many previous movies suck hard due to too much action and not enough time to establish a cohesive story with no plot holes (Suicide Squad). With the action not being the main focus until later on in the movie we get a decent story for once and that is such a breath of fresh air for modern DC movies. And when the action kicks in, it kicks IN. The action scenes are great and make me want to go to Zack Snyder's School of Badassery because god damn are these fight scenes good. The movie does have a habit of touching on a few things that would make OK side plots, but they just either forget about them or don't use them to their full extent. The TotallyNotSteveRogers guy who acts as the second main character assembles a team to help infiltrate a German base. These members are all interesting with Charlie being my favourite, but there are a lot of things about them that weren't touched on later in the film like Charlie seeing ghosts and is haunted by them in his sleep so he can't shoot his gun anymore. This would've made an EXCELLENT side plot if they actually gave a shite about it. As soon as it's talked about it's only referenced one more time and that's like nearly ten minutes later, then it's completely forgotten about. Then there are also a few things that made me go ''WTF'' like later on in the movie where Diana puts on a blue dress to disguise herself and it looks like she's wearing nothing underneath it, but then 5 minutes later she's on a horse and takes it off while riding it (SOMEHOW) and reveals that she's been wearing her heavy ass armour the entire time underneath it. Things like that don't really affect my overall enjoyment of the movie, but just tick me off when rewatching it. The acting is good (Gal Gadot was just born for being the actor of Wonder Woman/Diana) and the special effects, for as little as they are used, are OK and the plot is decent. All of these features give the movie a 7/10 which is not a bad score, I just wish the movie was better. The amount of critical praise it's getting is just as baffling as the new IT remakes praise, because neither are perfect. Far from, actually. This isn't the movie of the century and it isn't perfect, but it's a good movie that you can just enjoy without reading to much into it. It's just entertainment, that's all a movie should be. Not saying movies with deeper meanings and complex plots aren't good, hell they rank as some of my favourite movies of all time, but if a movie is simple like Wonder Woman, then I'm fine with it. Especially if it tells me that DC released two good movies in a row in one year. I would recommend Wonder Woman if you're willing to give DC another chance."

","Patty Jenkins has directed the best installment of the DC Extended Universe to date, without question. It has a strong story, excellent action sequences and packs an emotional punch, but ultimately results to nosediving during the third act. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are near perfect in their respective roles as Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor; Gadot in particular is one of the film's best parts. The story moves along at an impressive rate, thanks in no small part to Jenkins' powerful direction. But ultimately, every film has three acts, and the first two in this picture were brilliant. After walking out of the cinema following the third act however, I felt underwhelmed; David Thewlis is totally miscast as antagonist Ares, and the the dialogue he says during the final battle is very shoddy. The climax itself is just a cacophony of loud noise and overwhelming explosions, and feels oddly rushed in contrast to the rest of the film. Another minor criticism I have is the depth deprived nature of the secondary villains, which really detracts from the reality of the time specific setting for the film, as well as the underused supporting cast, who seem to only be there to make up the numbers. However, I found the film entertaining enough, and lighter in comparison to BVS, which is a change I definitely approve of. Whilst DC are still strides behind Marvel in terms of film quality, Wonder Woman is certainly a step in the right direction."

","I've seen the movie twice now, at several months interval. At first I really liked it because finally we saw a proper, well done DC movie. I thought many of the situations were funny, I liked that they were ballsy enough to make Wonder Woman actually kill people. The special effects are great, and the main actors are good. I liked the WW1 setting and the photography, as well as the rampage scene at the end where she goes crazy.<br/><br/>On the second viewing I was more reserved though. I think the first act is too long, it leaves few scenes at the battlefront, there's 2 really : the trenches and the village, plus the airfield. I think the main issue I had were the dialogues though. Some were really really cheesy, like love will save us all, or when Trevor asks Diana to help him after she killed the German general and nothing happened. There's like a full 60 sec of hesitation and poor writing... It was really hard to watch. The Amazon battle was a bit too much too, all these showy gymnastics, and the death of her aunt that wlacked drama. The Ares twist is also a bit too difficult to swallow, as well as how easy she kills him in the end (problem for Justice League : if she can kill the God of War that easily, who can fight her...). Those are not too serious problems, it's still a good movie, but I doubt it will stand the test of time. We tend to be magnanimous because it's the first female hero movie, and because there has been so many bad DC movies lately, but in the end it's a good film, not a masterpiece."

To it's credit, I didn't feel particularly bored at any point, but it's safe to say that the film is better when Steve and Diana arrive in London so perhaps that's why the first half of the film suffers by comparison.<br/><br/>Once Steve and Diana arrive in London then the film certainly becomes more enjoyable; there are plenty of fish-out-of-water jokes which are amusing and both Pine and Gabot have a nice easy-going chemistry which also helps to make the film enjoyable. The story is OK, but the light-hearted tone goes a long way and it's a film that you feel is constantly winking and nodding at its audience.<br/><br/>Although the story is OK and just about has the legs to carry the film there are other elements to the film that are rather weak; the villains are underdeveloped, their plan/scheme isn't really given the focus that it deserves and some aspects of the plotting are absolutely ludicrous, but as I've said these weaker aspects are overshadowed by the overall sense of fun that is on offer here.<br/><br/>There are no real standout performances here, but the main cast all muck in together and are all good in their own right. Lucy Davis was the only surprise here as she is barely recognisable in her respective role - in fact I think it was well over halfway into the film before I realised it was her (and I only recognised her on a close up shot).<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is entertaining and enjoyable and for much of the second half of the film it does have its tongue in its cheek. However, an overlong backstory, underdeveloped villains and some absurd plotting hold it back slightly meaning that it isn't as great as it could have been. On balance though, it's a pretty fun ride and a relatively enjoyable piece of escapism."
"drystyx","7","0","5","2 November 2017"," Back to basics
","The super hero movies have been rampant for a few decades. This one is about the Amazon beauty called Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>The rage has usually been to go for blinding, numbing special effects and hate mongering demonic love, particularly with the Beavis and Butthead approach to the Batman series.<br/><br/>This one goes back to basics. It has special effects, but they're on the side, not the front. There is too much use of special effects in this movie, but at least time out is taken for story and characters. And the love for demons isn't here. Instead, we get more of a mortal look at real people you can find credible.<br/><br/>The gusto and bravery of the Amazon women is explained, so we can understand their fearlessness. When Wonder Woman meets the mortal men in combat, she finds a different credibility.<br/><br/>In fact, this film is very symbolic of the times that the first world culture has entered. First world culture has produced a slew of bubble boys who think they are as fearless as the Amazon tribe. One way to identify these bubble boys and girls is if they claim they would be like the Amazon women or the other fearless characters. If so, they've labeled themselves as the very people this film is identifying.<br/><br/>So, the creators of this film let them stand in with Wonder Woman herself, to see the frailty of Man. Unfortunately, the point will be moot with these viewers. They will not see themselves among the mortals. They'll continue in their bubbles. Still, this film does make the effort.<br/><br/>As of this date, most Americans, most first world people, at least those who don't live in poverty, haven't an inkling about the horrors of war. Oh, they claim they know, and love the hate mongering demon worshiping movies, but if they really had pain in their lives, they wouldn't need to look for pain. In fact, most of them will not like this film, because it isn't demonic enough for them. Hopefully, they can stay in their bubbles and never know horror.<br/><br/>But this is a pretty good film. I would rather see fewer special effects. Less dulling play from special effects people. I suppose they have to prove they can do it, but it is dull. Sane viewers, like myself, would rather see the story and characters."

My biggest issue was with the villain, misleading Ares's (the evil God who dedicated his life and power to destroy humanity for no good reason), was first introduce via a lazy told bedtime (literally), the way they tried to mislead audience to think that he is General Ludendroff before revealing that he is actually the sweet sir Morgan was enforced. And the final fight just demolished both characters Wonder Woman and Ares, a very very very typical massive total destruction fight with two ridiculously powerful beings where we know the hero will struggle a bit, then knock off the bad guy. <br/><br/>Actors did a very good job, specially Gal, she had the right balance of looks, charisma, and acting skills, her body could be a bit more fit for the role. She handled actions/emotions/humor flawlessly.

","Wonder Woman has definitely been one of the best DC movies to come out in recent years. After flops like The Green Lantern and Batman and Superman, it was refreshing to see the studio produce a good plot with a likable protagonist. However, I couldn't help but feel like I had seen this all before.<br/><br/>The similarities to Marvel's Captain America are startling. Both occur during one of the World Wars, following a ""Super Soldier"" and their band of misfit soldiers as they combat the deeper evil that is really behind all of the conflict. Watching Wonder Woman do stunts that we saw Steve Rogers doing in 2011 can pull the viewer out of the experience of the movie.<br/><br/>After watching Wonder Woman, I am left with multiple unanswered questions. One of the first scenes that we get a taste of Wonder Woman's power is in a training session early in the movie. When she defends herself using her braces, a massive shock wave is emitted, knocking her opponent in the air. We never get an explanation of how she activates said power, and it is never again used in the movie, despite multiple instances where it would be extremely useful.<br/><br/>All in all, Wonder Woman is an improvement overall from the past experiences we have all had with DC movies. Though entertaining and visually appealing, clichés and plot holes leave the viewer slightly dissatisfied."
"fung0","7","0","4","29 September 2017"," Above average, but no more
","And that's only because the average has gotten so dreadfully low. Wonder Woman is a largely by-the-numbers film. In fact, it's almost entirely a remake of the 2009 animated film of the same name (which also was 'above average' - for a children's cartoon).<br/><br/>What works:<br/><br/>* Gal Gadot is not a great actress (so far), but she is physically perfect for the part, and, aided by competent direction, she becomes a very satisfying Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>* The World War I setting is novel, and allows a grittier texture than we're seeing in most superhero films. (It's the chief element that's been added, compared to the animated version.)<br/><br/>* Wonder Woman's action scenes are beautifully filmed, perfectly capturing that iconic quality that every superhero needs.<br/><br/>What doesn't:<br/><br/>* The story is rather thin, and largely a rehash of the (much better) first Captain America film, albeit set 30 years earlier.<br/><br/>* (SPOILER) I guessed the big villain reveal the instant his 'secret identity' character came on-screen. Note to writers: trying to surprise the audience by means of a tired cliché is kind of futile. Much smarter would have been to let us in on the twist right from the start, so we could follow the Machiavellian politics. There's a huge untapped irony in having the chief proponent of peace actually be the strongest supporter of endless war. (END SPOILER)<br/><br/>* The biggest disappointment, and the biggest missed opportunity, is the presentation of World War I. Arriving on Themiscyra, Trevor introduces the Germans as ""the bad guys,"" setting the trivial tone. It may be fair enough to demonize Hitler and his Nazis, but it's not so easy to muster blind hatred for Kaiser Wilhelm II, a rather typical monarchist leader who most of us know nothing about. Later in the film the point is made that 'all sides are at fault for making war.' But it is never acknowledged that The Great War was the perfect illustration of that truth. This was an opportunity for the film to put down real emotional and philosophical roots. Instead, by shying away from the historical reality, it deliberately remains superficial and uninvolving.<br/><br/>In summary: the scenes of Wonder Woman in action are great - but they're offset by a lack of depth in the characters, a lack of depth in the historical setting, and a typically over-long DC climactic battle with the villain.<br/><br/>The people creating these comic book films need to realize that the rules of drama apply to them too. The most exciting action, the most colorful heroes, all fall flat without a strong dramatic foundation. Either make the film a bit longer, or make the big battle a bit shorter - and put that time towards building some real empathy for the *people*, some real depth to their setting.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is certainly the best of the recent DC films, but only because it shares their failings to a lesser degree. I grew up loving comics, especially superhero comics. I've seen the good, the bad and the unbelievably lame - originally for 10 cents. With hundred-million dollar budgets at its disposal, Hollywood can and should be doing a lot better."

","It may be the right time for some heroes, but it's the wrong time for some stories. Superheroes in the cinema are as common as they were in the childhood of many (30+) viewers. A mostly male scene, deserves a female counterpart. Those are Wonder Woman, Black Widow and more to come.<br/><br/>But apart from being the hero we (or female fans) deserve, the superhero genre more than others, needs a story, more than a pretty face. Luckily, the director gave Wonder Woman more than just heroism, super strength and bravery. They chose for a hero who is conflicted with her own kind, but also with mankind, making her lonely in more than one aspect.<br/><br/>The mistake however is also making her young and naive. Being young and naive could be the right choice if there was more time, or if it was through flashbacks. Being a hero is often a story about growing up, maturing, letting go and accepting responsibility. There are 2 red threads: the hero that doesn't choose his path but has to (Superman, Spiderman), and the hero that does choose his path and wants to (Batman, Captain America). But that has been done before, and too many times. As stated, Spider-Man, Captain America, etc.<br/><br/>What sets Wonder Woman apart is her special heritage. The director could've chosen to focus on her childhood, her development, her mythology, but that's the part that was rushed. The director could've chosen to focus on her relation with other heroes, to make her a part of the bigger DC universe. But unfortunately she chose the familiar path of a hero that decides to go to the war (sounds familiar), gets confronted with something that's bigger than her, and finds a way to defeat it. With that path, the movie falls flat as it fails to set itself apart as different. The well timed comedy, the lessons about humanity and the good job by Gal Gadot couldn't save this from being standard."

She has not been made out of clay but rather she has been implanted in this universe to sow seeds of corruption, hate and greed. Ares' adversary is a Robot Machine villain who comes alive at the end of the comic film. The Robot Machine looks like a combination of Sauron and Terminator (1984) robots. In the last couple of scene sequences, Woman Woman (2017) has Ares and the Robot Machine villain fighting each other. Ares gains strength through the Robot Machine and develops even more special powers, and in the end Ares lives and the Robot Machine parishes.

"ajrcvr","5","0","8","20 August 2017"," Decent story, fair character
","The story is okay, and I suppose that's what counts, but since the movie is all about Wonder Woman, you need a fairly awesome female to play her, and, although Gal Gadot has a cutsy-pie face sure enough, realistically she comes up short in the body department - not even close to Lynda Carter's awesome curves and bod, and that is really the story here. She also lacks in the musculature department, also not close to Sofia Boutella (Jayla in Star Wars Beyond), who has a magnificently athletic and muscular body and yet is still feminine and sexy. A cute face is not enough to be Wonder Woman; that mythical Amazon is a lot more than that. I notice, too, that when you compare Gadot's bikini pics with her in her Wonder Woman outfit, they pulled in her waist and pumped up her boobs to give her a sexier appearance, which she doesn't actually have. Body-wise, she's actually quite ordinary; there are many better built models & actresses than her around. Always makes me wonder how they pick these people, and what criterion they use. They're supposed to be getting a muscular, athletic person for this part, and they just got some ordinary model with a cute face - which strains the credibility of the character and therefore the believability of the character and the story. A similar mistake was made with ScarJo for the Major in GITS: beautiful girl, decent actress, physically terrific, but wrong for the part of Motoko because she's not Asian! In fact, she's as far away from Asia as you could get. It's like using Jackie Chan or Jet Li to play Robin Hood - both great physical characters, athletic, good actors, wrong for the part for obvious reasons. They could have done a better job for Wonder Woman than this Israeli actress;; for instance, check out Israeli model Bar Refaeli - much better in every category, physically; at least as beautiful, maybe more so, and a much better body. Don't know if she can act, but you get my point as to what Wonder Woman should look like. How the character physically appears is everything in this story; and Gal Gadot just doesn't measure up, and it's a shame that they have to doctor her physical appearance in the Wonder Woman outfit to give her credibility."

OK she does say this is terrible we have to do something. (but emotional, eeuh sorry no), Please take some additional acting lessons.<br/><br/>CGI well if you take the CGI of 1997 Starship troopers with this one well let's just say when a fight starts so does the CGI, all this talk about Gal training hard for this movie. Well I could only see computerized animations of a woman who could do just about anything but fly (well she does come close)<br/><br/>With regards to the story line, it simply has too many flaws. How nice would it have been if the makers would have stayed true to the original story that Diana had to beat all amazonian warriors in a contest to be allowed to help our stranded pilot and enter the ""Great War"". in stead she sneaks out. (sorry mum I have to go)<br/><br/>We have a beach scene where rowboats full of Germans Arrive, OK they are defeated, but what about the battleships from where they came?<br/><br/>Our flight boy (US) (Spy) seems to be allowed in a room with all major players on the allied side (a bit odd isn't it) he even get's his orders from a UK superior..<br/><br/>Oh there is a moment at which they are in no-mans land, and wonderwoman just crosses the field.. walks through gas clouds (oh yeah she's a god all off a sudden)<br/><br/>Most laughable item is actually when the attack an occupied village, of course they save the village, and our hero, just picks up the phone in a local bakery and dials London, REALLY I kid you not!! it's 1911, let alone that no German army would allow any landlines to exist directly to London. In WW2 the resistance had short wave radios but come on..<br/><br/>Oh another thing, the village was just near a castle where all high officials of Germany are attending a feast. REALLY, when the village had just fallen, where are the reinforcements, only 2 guards at the castle..<br/><br/>Let alone a drunk Scott who's supposed to be an amazing sharp shooter, as if..<br/><br/>One last thing, our male hero, had 2 opportunities to kill dr Poison in stead he tries to woo her.. (yeah really, oh he gets interrupted by wonder woman) <br/><br/>I'm sorry was Able to watch the movie without leaving just because I was still interested in the ending, Hence still the 5..<br/><br/>But A Wise Word to All, Please Please go see the original Wonderwoman series airing from 1975 with Lynda Carter, really it's a lot better"

","This blockbuster certainly showcased excellent performances all-round, incredible CGI and other effects and did very well as an origin story.<br/><br/>The performances of Chris Pine and Gal Gadot were excellent, as were the supporting actors. However, the supporting characters had both little screen time and little impact on the movie. They were essentially left on for occasional comic relief and to fill in an open space. Their own identities are explored only very briefly and their abilities are never truly shown or used. Villains Sir Patrick, General Ludendorff and Dr. Maru had the same problem. We never got to understand their characters, never got into their mindset and It was disappointing at how little they were used. The Amazons are a partial exception. Although they were on-screen for a short period of time, they proved their worth similar to how Khan proved his in Star Trek Into Darkness. However, they ended up being swept away too soon anyway. <br/><br/>Special effects were absolutely amazing and I don't think anyone could possibly complain about it. Costumes were fitting for a period piece and the uniforms of the Germans in the village and the troops in the trenches were particularly well-done with quite nice attention to detail. <br/><br/>The plot is one of its pitfalls. Compared to Logan, released earlier in the year, Wonder Woman's plot just feels overused, drab and a bit of a flop. To be honest, it just wasn't written as well as I had hoped and just isn't up to the same standard of Logan in terms of plot. The storyline was a bit cliché, with one character selflessly sacrificing himself, the main character using the death as motivation, blah, blah, blah. This has just been used too many times to hold the same entertainment value. It's humor in how Diana attempts to get in touch with the fashion standards of 1918 was dull and rather 'cringe' at best. Overall, it is very linear and predictable. It lacked enough character development to actually bring true emotion to all. <br/><br/>Another point which I found irritating was it's overuse of very blatant symbolism. There are just too much symbolism to make the film have flow. Symbolism should be subtle but present. In Wonder Woman, it just feels forced. <br/><br/>I do have to compliment whoever made the soundtrack. I'd say it's on par with the soundtrack of The Dark Knight. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie would've benefited much from additional character development and use of supporting characters. Excellent performances, great effects, dramatic soundtrack, fitting consume and make-up in additional to incredible action sequences which was let down by a rather lackluster, cliché and slightly flawed plot. Enjoyable movie but it was just missing that little bit."

","I should preface this review by admitting (or rather confirming) I was one of the few who actually liked and would recommend Man of Steel. I appreciated the flashback look at the origin story. In addition, I found the darker thematic elements more akin to the Dark Knight trilogy of Nolan. While I wouldn't agree it hit on all cylinders like those did, I found it a good take on Kal-El of Krypton. And in Wonder Woman, we are again treated to an idyllic origin story that involves an island of beautiful Amazonian women. I'm just not quite sure it could get any better than that. Right?<br/><br/>While the movie does earn the title to this review, it unfortunately did not ""get any better than it's 'origin'. The peak of the movie does happen within the first 30min with an impressive beach battle scene involving these Amazons against the Germans of the first World War. It's thrilling, well choreographed and has consequences. It sets the table for a good movie to come, and in some respects, may have raised expectations too high for some. <br/><br/>I stand by my title, that this is the best of the DCEU films, but let's face it, other than the Nolan Batman trilogy (not counted in the DCEU here) it doesn't have a significantly high bar to win that award. But it does entertain with humor, action and a message of believing in what's right. There are some heroic moments for our protagonist. And there is a bit of a plot twist that might surprise. It isn't all bad. But, it also isn't ""all"" good. It has some plot contrivances and missteps that hinder a glowing recommendation from this reviewer. Having offered that up, I will still add it to my collection. Gal Gadot, though not the strongest actor on the screen, did enough to earn the tiara she wears. But she is overshadowed by stronger talent around her both on Themyscira (Connie Nielsen & Robin Wright) and in London (Chris Pine). <br/><br/>It is the talent around Gadot, the wonderful cinematography early in the film, and the steady progression of the story to its end that helps me recommend this movie.<br/><br/>Grade B-"
"elbolero","4","0","6","25 June 2017"," Movie ignores canon and sadly historically revises WW *contains spoilers*
","With Marvel cleaning DC's clock with their films, this was DC's huge chance to make up some ground. With the exception of picking Gal Gadot, DC failed horribly.<br/><br/>The 2 biggest points in favor of WW: picking Gadot and changing her uniform to the original red, yellow and blue instead of the awful, drab brown originally seen. I'm not aware of other actresses that could have resembled Lynda Carter's WW enough to be close. Probably her strongest scene was when she crossed no man's land, with troops following and backing her up, as this would be the spirit of WW, as well as when she eliminates Veld's sniper and pretty much liberates it single-handedly--which highlighted WW's athleticism.<br/><br/>Biggest mistake: ditching canon. Like most DC comics, WW began during WW 2 and even Carter's WW starts there. Arbitrarily going to WW 1 leaves avid WW fans like me scratching their heads. The only things remotely canon are Themyscira's depiction and how some Amazons trained, and Trevor crashing off its coast. Second mistake was casting Pine as Trevor: he failed horribly to depict Kirk in Abram's reboot of Trek and played this bumbling, arrogant and flippant fool; he botches Trevor similarly (he has also failed to be in a single truly high-grossing hit movie where he's first-billed, especially in Abram's Trek compared to modern-adjusted earnings from the originals). In the 70s WW and the comics, Trevor was relatively decisive, sometimes a bit impulsive, but never bumbling and searching for words--the movie even failed to have him call WW his trademark ""angel."" He also worked American intelligence--never British--and never went to London, only the U.S. Excepting Etta Candy's general appearance, she was also not British and yet where was her trademark ice-cream eating? This was pushed onto WW, which while a cute gesture, was misplaced. While I suppose the writers wanted ""dirty London"" as an about-face to Paradise Island's beauty, you should NEVER pick a random element when there's so much canonical info available. Regarding WW showing Amazons training, the sickening change is twofold: mom forbidding Diana to train and how it depicts the training. In the comics, Hippolyta never forbad Diana to train--only to compete in who would become WW. She always trained hard and wanted to be the best; she then competed in the WW tourney masked and won; this displeased Hippolyta but b/c of the rules, accepted Diana as WW willingly--and blessed her. Also, her ""godly"" origin was never revealed until MUCH later in comic run, when she was invited to become a goddess on Mount Olympus--which is another thing this movie arbitrarily destroys somehow to set up a godkiller sword and Ares' demise? The entire WW mythos lives only because the Greek gods still exist to sometimes aid WW or cause her grief. Additionally, while Antiope exists in WW, Philippa and Artemis (especially in the modern runs) were major players on Themyscira; Philippa would have directed Diana's training and Artemis would have supported this, especially since Artemis was the deadliest known Amazonian bowman. However, neither of these support WW and the movie mentions them only in passing. As a consequence of not showing the canonical WW tournament, Diana never receives her golden belt, which gave her such awesome strength (see 70s Carter's WW run). Furthermore, only Hippolyta carried a sword and shield as regular parts of her WW run--not Diana! What about Hippolyta? While Nielsen is HUGE eye candy, she is not raven-haired like the queen should be; moreover, Hippolyta is always decisive and firm, sometimes a tad hot-headed-- but always fair ultimately. Nielsen seems tentative, doubtful and sadly bumbles through her role much like Pine.<br/><br/>In general, other things that do not compute would be Trevor's ""selection"" of a supporting cast, which feels too eerily similar to two films: The League of Extraordinary Gentleman and the first Captain America. Oddly enough however, none of them prove exceptionally helpful nor valuable, which kind of wastes their potential supposed contribution (even the mobster additions to Schwarzenegger's ""Eraser"" proved comical yet far more helpful)-- especially with the likes of veteran Saïd Taghmaoui (Hidalgo, GI Joe)--who could have shown his acting chops as both a great horseman and fighter; yet, we only partly see these skills used. Even using Ares seems to harken to the 2009 DC animated Wonder Woman version where Ares escapes Paradise Island and infects man's world with rage, hate and paranoia (remind you of anything?). At least there, Trevor (Nathan Fillion, who would have done well as Trevor in this) proves a capable fighter, shows off his true piloting chops, and even Diana uses her Invisible Plane which was totally absent in this on screen version. Sadly, the 2009 animated version shames this theatrical one by its writing, casting, acting and far better use of canon (Diana even follows Steve to his world and Trevor gives her far better explanations for cultural norms and expected behaviors, something largely ignored by this film.<br/><br/>Verdict--4 stars: 2 stars off for poor casting; -2 stars for disregarding canon/rank and cheap/random historical revisionism; -2 for poor writing that wasted what was hyped to be DC's major chance to show up Marvel by producing a compelling, canonical version of events, using moderately successful actors to help carry the movie...but it strikes out totally there too. Skip the theater and wait for it on Netflix or Redbox."

","(Spoilers)<br/><br/>The film starts off great. Diana's origin story and her life on Paradise Island is well told, and the unexpected casting of Robin Wright made me excited to see this film. Even Chris Pine's entrance into the film is good; but then they leave the island, and all of their great storytelling goes in the garbage can.<br/><br/>The screenplay and characters from that point on are recycled from other films. The only thing that separated the antagonist in Wonder Woman and Darth Vader from Star Wars is a breathing problem and a glowing sword. I like Gadot better than I thought I would, and the effects are cool, but the screenplay simply sucks. Wonder Woman becomes a weakened ""fish out of water"" story for way too long, and the love story seems forced and thrown in at the last minute.<br/><br/>I know I'm going to fork over more cash for Justice League, but so far in hindsight, not one of the DC movies has deserved a penny of my money."

","First off, I did enjoy the film.<br/><br/>However, whilst the viewer obviously has to suspend 'reality' in this genre, there were several WTF moments. Which, although not ruinous, did put rather a 'fly' in the wonder. <br/><br/>What I liked : <br/><br/>Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were great throughout <br/><br/>I liked the island of the Amazons and the back story of the 'gods'. <br/><br/>Setting it into the context of WWI<br/><br/>I quite liked the female evil German scientist but felt she was underused.<br/><br/>I like the baddie as the god aries.<br/><br/>What I didn't like: <br/><br/>The several moments that didn't make much sense. e.g.<br/><br/>Pine flies his fokker eindecker from Turkey and gets to the Amazon island, I can accept that, even though WWI planes had very short range e.g. 150 miles. This is acceptable for the genre not to question it.<br/><br/>But apparently Germans following, are in row boats followed by a warship to chase the plane? WWI planes are slow, but row boat slow? OK they rowing through fog but chasing a plane with a ship?<br/><br/>The Germans in their row boats, come through the mist and discover a new magic island. Their first thought is attack it. WTF? OK they are chasing the pilot but its one bedraggled man on a beach. <br/><br/>The German warship following the rowing Germans, for no apparent reason, keels over, (must have been the shock of discovering a magical island) <br/><br/>Diana going with American Capt.Trevor to WWI London is all good, <br/><br/>Pine, after reporting to rather stupid Generals, wants to set off and destroy the nasty German poison gas factory, OK we can ignore all the logistical and intelligence info plot holes. <br/><br/>But after being refused permission he has to assemble his little band of plucky rogues, disobey orders and destroy the bad factory.<br/><br/>First off there is absolutely no justification for this group. A drunken scots sniper, who never actually shoots, has battle fatigue. Some sort of Turkish/Arab salesman type and then later a north American Indian. <br/><br/>All of these add nothing to the story. Nothing at all. Take them out, it's the same. <br/><br/>Apparently they can move from London to the war torn western front in France/Belgium without anyone questioning them. Let alone asking for papers, although they obviously look distinctly dubious. <br/><br/>After capturing a town on the front, where suddenly lots of local appear, they can phone from the front back to London during WWI with no problem. 1918 telephone communications are amazing.<br/><br/>Ludendorf is made out to be something of an arch baddie, but is a bit of a let down. Despite being ruthless and snorts special gas courtesy of evil German poison gas scientist, to give him super powers. WTF <br/><br/>Is this the earliest recorded example of vaping ? <br/><br/>He is arranging to have a new super deadly gas dropped on London via aeroplane. The bomber is remarkably advanced for 1918 and can take a payload that modern bombers would be proud of. OK this is picky but the previous unbelievable moments make you more sensitive. <br/><br/>.............................................................<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>I did enjoy the film, its not terrible by any means.<br/><br/>However, if they had put more time and effort entwining fantasy with reality, so it was difficult to see the join, then it would have been a great film. <br/><br/>I found it rather disappointing, dumbed down like a children's movie. 6.5/10"

"nmn34","8","0","5","18 June 2017"," A Great Movie That Makes A Fatal Mistake.
","DC's movies have not been great. I'd even go so far as to say they haven't been good. Fortunately for Warner Brothers, Wonder Woman is far better than their latest crop of movies and actually rivals the recent clutch of Marvel films. For once, DC didn't screw this up.<br/><br/>Gal Godot is Wonder Woman as Margot Robbie was Harley Quinn. I am hard pressed to think of any actress that could do the role better. But unlike Suicide Squad, the writing wasn't an abomination of cringe worthy dialogue and very short sighted plot development. There are moments of cringe, I'll get to that later, but by and large the movie is simple in focus and coherent in practice. She has a single goal, defeat Ares and end WWI, and a character of someone would understand and somewhat expect from someone of her up bringing. She was raised as royalty on a secluded island, put through extreme training far exceeding her peers, and had been constantly fed the same story. When she grows up and is exposed to the world at large, she is headstrong, a little stupid, but strong enough to brute force her way through any situation. She charges into no man's land without a second thought, tries to assassinate a German general in the middle of a gala surrounded by soldiers, and is so dead set on killing Ares that she is easily fooled into suspecting the wrong man to be him. And she does all this because she doesn't know any better. On all accounts she is her own worst enemy, she knows the pointy end of a sword from the not the pointy end in a time where bolt action rifles have replaced swords, but like a good baby face she still muscles up the fortitude to persevere.<br/><br/>The effects are good with a couple exceptions here and there but they are a little overused. Seeing her block bullets is cosmetically pleasing, they use slowdown well so that you can see the bullet pancake, the first few times. Then they keep doing it. Again and again, just enough to kill the impact of the effect but not enough to frustrate the audience. They merely get numb to it. Still, the no man's land scene was very well done, with tracer bullets exploding against her shield and slapping a mortar out of the air. There are times where the CGI is terrible however and they usually involve hitting guns. They crumple under her fist in a way that looks like a cinematic from a PS2 game. You know they aren't real things in the environment.<br/><br/>As I said, there are a few gaffes here and there. When the Germans try to capture Steve Trevor, you can see gun boats in the distance but they didn't play any role in the battle with the Amazons. You'd think they'd at least try to bombard the island after learning the inhabitants are hostile, or at least clear the cliffs so their ground troops could land safely. Mustard gas has no effect on Diana, she charges in to find an entire town dead and while Trevor can't get near the cloud, she walks out as right as rain. Furthermore, the movie takes place at the closing of the war but mustard gas has not been used yet nor is it ever used on enemy soldiers. They even ignore the fatal flaw of such a weapon, the threat of the wind blowing it back at your own troops. Theoretically, the Hitler in their universe would be even worse than the Hitler of ours. Not witnessing the horrible effects of poison gas first hand, he would not have detested such a weapon so much not to use it on the front lines. But these are relatively minor gripes, and they don't really mount to much.<br/><br/>The one terrible thing about this movie I can ascribe, it failed to live up to its purpose. This movie was a set up for the upcoming Justice League movie. I don't want to see the Justice League movie, I want Wonder Woman 2. This movie out hyped the headliner which can be bad news for WB. That being said, while I want a sequel, I know it cannot live up to the expectations of this one. And that is because of the choice of villain, Ares. There is no one in her villain menagerie that can follow him. She went from zero to the second coming of Jesus and smite the devil in one movie. I'm not saying Blue Snowman should have got top billing but had they started with a major villain like Barrenness Paula von Gunther, they could have built for him to star in a sequel or even a third movie. After this, who is going to believe a regular human NAZI is going to pose any threat to a killer of gods? No one, because WB wanted to churn a quick set up for a movie that already looks like a dumpster fire. All this universe garbage killed any chance of a good sequel."

"laniejones","7","0","5","14 June 2017"," A normal origin story
","I was incredibly excited to go see Wonder Woman mostly because of the reviews -- and, of course, the excitement among women that we finally, finally had a superhero movie all to ourselves. I would say that, perhaps, my expectations were through the roof; I was bound to get my hopes smashed a little bit. And I won't lie: they were. But the more I've thought about the movie I saw, the more I have come to terms with what was given, and the more that I've come to enjoy the message I took with me.<br/><br/>See, Wonder Woman is your average, cheesy superhero origin story. The only difference is that it's a woman at the forefront -- which, of course, makes it abnormal in the superhero genre. However, the movie is no more or less cheesy than Captain America, or Iron Man, or the far too many Spiderman movies we've now had thrown in our faces. Is the writing a bit underwhelming and quite lazy? Yeah, it is. There are times where I seriously rolled my eyes because the writing definitely could have been better. But the action was top- notch (I don't usually like slo-mo, but it was used perfectly here), and the message was strong and clear. <br/><br/>It bothered me, at first, that the movie was so....simple, in a way. I guess you could say I'm so used to broody, dark, pseudo- intellectual superhero movies that followed in Nolan's footsteps (I'm looking at you, Man of Steel) that I wasn't quite expecting a superhero movie that went back to the basics. Wonder Woman wasn't without its critiques on modern issues, but they were interspersed throughout the film and unavoidable BECAUSE of the protagonist's entire backstory. And yet, I was waiting throughout the movie for some lightbulb moment of truth about life. <br/><br/>When that moment came, at the time I found it mediocre and predictable because the movie had been hinting at it all along, but I've since realized this was purposeful. The director, it seemed, always intended to have the movie be straightforward in its themes, and lighthearted in its mode of getting this theme across. The theme of love, choosing love, and accepting humans for all of their flaws was always the intended message, and it was a CLEAR message with little other room for interpretation (which was the point). Although the acting at times was wooden, and the dialogue off in quite a few scenes, the end game was always to get this clear, empowering message about humanity across - - without any weird, unnecessary brood in the middle. Was the love plot a little dissatisfying? Yes. Was it necessary to further the message? Yes. Were the side characters...unnecessary? Yes. But I'll argue they were needed in order to make it, like all the others, a cheesy, classic superhero movie. And while at first I was irritated that Wonder Woman was so...classic...I'm glad that it was, because it makes room for fleshing out her story further in the sequels. <br/><br/>I'm okay with that, mostly because it allows me to see more killer action sequences (more Amazons, please!) with a solid protagonist."
"graupepillard","6","0","5","11 June 2017"," Warrior Woman meets Man and loses her Innocence
","25 years ago I created a 'Wonder Women Wall"" for The Port Authority Bus Terminal in NYC made up of an installation of pastels/cutouts on canvas drawings of powerful women - women whose courage and toughness is discernible in the pursuit of their dreams; women who negotiate the daily struggles of life's conflagrations; women who are mothers, sisters and daughters who endure the everyday grind of work, and fight for what they believe in with tenderness and tenacity. They are all flesh and blood, vulnerable Wonder Women who prevail; not immortal, but dealing with their mortality without the aid of super-human powers, lacking a sword and shield, steel wrist band bracelets, and breast plates. They are the breathing, conscious descendants of the mythic phenomenal Wonder Woman - the D.C. comics Amazon warrior who has the physical prowess of the greatest male warriors - a woman who captured my imagination as a young girl, when I was fighting to be seen and treated as the equal of the boys around me.<br/><br/>From the DC Comic database - some history on the origins of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman:<br/><br/>Diana is the daughter of Queen Hippolyta, the first child born on Paradise Island in the three thousand year history that the immortal Amazons lived there. The Amazons had been created around 1200 B.C. when the Greek goddesses drew forth the souls of all women who had been murdered by men and placed them on the island. One soul was held back from creation, the one that would be born as Diana. That soul originally belonged to the unborn daughter of the first woman murdered by a man (whom Hippolyta was the reincarnation of). In the late 20th Century, Hippolyta was instructed to mold some clay from the shores of Paradise Island into the form of a baby girl. Six members of the Greek Pantheon then bonded the soul to the clay, giving it life. Each of the six also granted Diana a gift: Demeter, great strength; Athena, wisdom and courage; Artemis, a hunter's heart and a communion with animals; Aphrodite, beauty and a loving heart; Hestia, sisterhood with fire; Hermes, speed and the power of flight. Diana grew up surrounded by a legion of sisters and mothers. When she was a young woman, the gods decreed that the Amazons must send an emissary into Man's WorldBefore embarking on her mission, Diana was given the Lasso of Truth, forged by Hephaestus himself. She was also given the Sandals of Hermes, which allowed her to instantly traverse great distances in seconds. Diana's mission was one of peace, but part of it initially involved defeating a mad plot by Ares to destroy the world. http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Wonder_Woman_(Diana_Prince)<br/><br/>Patty Jenkins the director of WONDER WOMAN charmingly recreates the idyllic Paradise Island - a peaceful enclave,where for many years the Amazons have been preparing and honing their battle skills for the return of Ares, the God of War - and the inevitable final clash between Good and Evil. We first view Diana - the future Wonder Woman - as a young mischievously headstrong child practicing in pantomime, echoing the slashing movements of swordplay, already fully confident of her own destiny.<br/><br/>Once Diana has grown into the beautiful, shapely Wonder Woman (played by Gal Gadot, a former model whose acting skills regrettably do not provide the ""gravitas"" or range of emotions that would have elevated her role from being a 2-D cartoon character,) the commercial Hollywood block-buster entertainment industry takes over the movie. They do so by placing Diana in the midst of The Great War (W.W. I) complete with flaming infernos, British spies and German villains experimenting with chemical substances to be unleashed upon the civilian populations. And just to brighten the mood, lame sex jokes playing on Diana's naiveté are regularly interspersed throughout the dialogue, revealing an innocence derived from being sheltered on a remote Island safeguarded from life's realities.<br/><br/>Meeting her first man, Steve Trevor, an American pilot (a baby-faced blue-eyed Chris Pine played cute) - tumbling out of the sky with his plane diving through the barrier mist that enshrouds this secret enclave from interlopers (a Freudian interpretation might be relevant,) he crashes into the surrounding waters, and is saved by Diana from drowning. This archetype of a ""strange species"" called ""man,"" both fascinates and confuses our heroine; nonetheless she is quickly captivated by this handsome soldier and accompanies him outside of her insulated universe in order to fulfill her destiny and bring ""good"" back into the Ares-corrupted world. Having bitten from the apple in the Garden of Eden, she becomes acutely aware of the destructive malevolence of a landscape outside her own. <br/><br/>The final scene in the movie is a spectacular light show of hell erupting with super-woman vaulting from one combat zone to another silhouetted against the glaring heat of combustion, as she saves humankind from the evils of darkness. We women can relate to that and applaud along with the audience in support of Wonder Woman's fight - though the special effects which attend the cataclysm resemble an amalgam of horror creatures and a wet, melting super monster. Diana's last words made me audibly groan and giggle: ""Only love can save the world."" What??? WONDER WOMAN's final message trivialized a film which had a lot of potential beyond redemption. Please Diana Prince go back to your Paradise and live among those other terrific Amazons - perhaps then you might regain my respect."

","I managed to go and check out Wonder Woman soon after it came out and I'm having mixed feelings about it. Part of me likes it, part of me isn't too convinced about the ending and the ending is really important in helping me figure out if I like a movie, and another part is saying, ""well what did you expect from a superhero movie?""<br/><br/>If the scene had action in it, I really liked it. I think my favorite parts so far were at the beginning where the Amazons fought the Germans, and when Diana is at No Man's Land (the part we see in the previews). I really liked how Chris Pine portrayed Steve Trevor. It was really simple but there was something really charismatic about him. It was enough for you to notice that he was one of the main characters but not enough that Diana was pushed to the back. As for Gal Gadot's acting, I liked it. I'm a fan of hers and she didn't disappoint this time either. <br/><br/>Aside from action packed scenes, the movie also had some funny moments during the down times. So why wasn't I feeling this movie? <br/><br/>Spoilers start here!<br/><br/>At the end of the movie Diana ends up killing Ludendorff because she thinks he's Ares. Throughout the movie she'd been going on and on about her duty to stop him but when she does kill him nothing happens. The war continues and she's left confused. We later learn that Ludendorff wasn't actually Ares but the part that bugs me is that it takes Steve Trevor for her to understand and to take certain action. Not to mention the mini-tantrum she had because she was wrong. ""What there's a bunch of dangerous gas out there that can wipe out millions and you need my help? Uhm no thanks, let me sulk here because I was wrong""<br/><br/>It's only after Steve talks to her and (basically) tells her that humans have an inner evil that she starts to understand. It's only after Steve blows himself up that she finally loses control and it's only after she remembers what he tells her (that he loves her) that she finally understands that humans are evil but that they are also capable of love. That love is the answer. It almost makes it seem like she didn't know what love was until Steve Trevor came into her life...<br/><br/>This might not seem like much but considering this movie is supposed to be about Wonder Woman, one of the few female superheroes, I was expecting something more. Something better. But Diana starts off as a naive girl, ignorant about the world and then she meets a man, can finally see the world because this man gave her the excuse to leave, and finally understands human nature thanks to said man<br/><br/>I usually don't care about representation but that's one of the reasons this movie was supposed to be such a good watch and it wasn't for me on that end. <br/><br/>It was a good watch because it had good action, but other than that, it's your typical PG-13 superhero movie. I gave it a 7/10 because I liked the action and because Gal Gadot was pretty cool"

","It would've taken a brave soul to confidently go out and say that Wonder Woman would be a success.<br/><br/>Of course it was always likely to make some quick $$ for its studio and get extra airplay due to its female driven hero being the centrepiece of the feature, but on the back of DC Comics recent output of films that have made money, but not exactly found a place of fondness within peoples affections, Wonder Woman was always going to be a wait and see proposition.<br/><br/>It's with some form of relief then that we can now safely say that Monster director Patty Jenkin's reimaging of a character that has long been left in the shadows of her manly counterparts is a success, financially and critically, but this big budgeted comic book event hides its genre defined play by plays behind the fact it has a female leading proceedings, in a film that remains constantly fun but also utterly by the numbers.<br/><br/>In a marketplace that has been inundated with comic book blockbusters for over a decade, Wonder Woman's story of Amazonian princess Diana leaving her idyllic all female only island life with Chris Pine's World War 1 American spy Captain James Kirk (aka comic book favourite Steve Trevor) to hunt down some incredibly weak ""German baddies"" and put a stop to the warring and fighting, is a story not up to the energy and appealing nature of its heroine.<br/><br/>From the moment Diana hops onto a boat with Steve and sets sail to experience the world, we know where the story is heading and as is the unfortunate usual nature of modern day comic book films, Wonder's Woman's more nuanced and original ideas feel squandered on an overblown conclusion and rather terrible computer generated spectacle that feels cut from another movie altogether.<br/><br/>The finale is actually a rather glaring example of Wonder Woman's often so-so CGI work that can at times take away from the visual pizazz and spectacle Jenkin's and her team have delivered when bringing Diana's whip and sword led carnage to life.<br/><br/>For a film with such strong production values elsewhere and budget to spare, it's curious as to why CGI in such a tentpole picture would look often like nothing more than a slightly above average video game. It may sound like nit-picking, but for a film centred on what it can provide to its audience in a visual sense, it's a big no-no.<br/><br/>Aside from some questionable CGI and lacking baddies (complete in one scene with a moment of almost Dr. Evil like laughter at their dastardly plans) Wonder Woman's other unfortunate element is the fact that it seems as though the studio for all its talk and bluster, was afraid to let Wonder Woman fully take centre stage in her own film.<br/><br/>Tagged in the majority of the runtime with Pine right alongside her, as our Godly princess learns the ropes of the outside world and her own true powers, Pine gets to play a version of his Enterprise captain and have almost equal screen time as Gal Gadot's incarnation, which is both a shame for the movie and for Gadot who really is the shining beacon of this otherwise standard event.<br/><br/>As she showcased in limited yet memorable screen time in Batman vs Superman, Gadot feels like the perfect fit for an icon like Diana Prince.<br/><br/>Showcasing the physical prowess, the smarts and the charisma the character needs, Gadot will no doubt become a newly minted superstar of the DC universe and whenever Gadot is allowed to take centre stage and get away from forced romantic flirtations with Pine or awkward costume fittings, Wonder Woman in full flight is a joyous sight to behold thanks to Gadot's career making turn and hopefully a reason for future standalone events to take further time to shine the spotlight on her character and her screen presence.<br/><br/>From running headfirst into the battlefields of Europe or beating up goons in the back alleys of old school London, you can't help but escape the feeling that Gadot and therefore Wonder Woman had more to give to this film than was eventually allowed.<br/><br/>Final Say – <br/><br/>Overcoming a rather laborious and cringe worthy opening act as well as some second rate visuals culminating in an unfortunately mediocre final stanza, when Wonder Woman herself is front and centre of this superhero film (with less of a difference than many would have you believe) it's a fun popcorn event that sets up a nice stepping stone for future adventures.<br/><br/>As long as they agree to let Gadot do her thing without the help of a male offsider.<br/><br/>3 Captain Kirk doppelgangers out of 5"

""Wonder Woman"" is directed by Patty Jenkins, who previously directed a vastly different looking Charlize Theron in the fantastic drama ""Monster"", which most believe to be Theron's best performance, and well, if there is one huge thing to say about ""Wonder Woman"", it is that Gal Gadot is pretty good as the red, white, and blue lead, which comes as a huge surprise seeing that most people consider Gadot to be a very weak actress, which there most certainly is a case for, BUT she is triumphant as our main lead. Chris Pine, who plays our main heroine's love interest is also pretty good here, both bringing charisma and a bevy laughs. The first thing you'll notice about the movie is how beautiful it looks when it comes to the glorious production and costume design. So now, let's get into the negatives that people seem to be disregarding. The film had me worried that it wouldn't be as good as people have suggested when the film starts with narration (of course) in the present(?) for some reason because, you know, Warner Bros. needs to let you know that this film is apart of a cinematic universe, I mean, it's not too bad but it really wasn't needed, then we head off to the island of the Amazonians, which looks beautiful but everything in it just falls sort of flat, we are introduced to our young Diana, who is very funny in parts but the kid's acting is just not good AT ALL, which is sometimes expected with kid actors. The cgi in this movie is just plain BAD, that plus the overuse of slo mo somewhat taints some pretty good action scenes, you can definitely tell that Patty Jenkins is a first time director in the superhero genre, (although plenty of directors don't fall into that trap like Nolan, Raimi, Singer) once we head off to London the film gets much better, it becomes a pretty good war film, it's the first time we've seen war portrayed, you know, LIKE WAR in a superhero movie, (sorry Cap) but as I said the great action scenes are tainted by bad visuals, an overabundance of slo mo, and hero shots up the wazoo. Now let's talk about the villains, the villains as expected here are absolutely terrible, just downright cartoonish, and once again we get a big cgi, explosion filled finale that gave me flashes of ""Batman v. Superman"". (although nowhere near as bad as that) Now does that sound like a revolutionary masterpiece to you? If so, see more movies immediately."

","Wonder Woman (Minor obvious spoilers) Everyone will know the outlines at this point – American spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) stumbles into the hidden Amazon island of Themyscira, and Diana accompanies him back into the world to put an end to not just WW1, but presumably all war forever. This she will do by smiting Ares with the god-killer sword. Ares in this version is not just another god with the regrettable portfolio of war, but the originator of humankind's fall, the Greek mythological equivalent of the biblical serpent who corrupts humankind. Once she does that, evil will end and humans will return to their primal innocence.<br/><br/>Well, they didn't write the outcome that way, that would have been really silly (but see below). We follow Steve and Diana as she carries her naïve belief through nine-tenths of the action, even as she is confronted by the vast, senseless misery and human butchery that is war. She's convinced that Ares has taken the form of German general Erich Ludendorff, and offing him will put an end to his evil influence and the war will simply stop, collapsing like a balloon with the air let out. (I make for a poor historian, but I take it the story stays within the actual historical development that an armistice was about to end the war anyway, out of sheer exhaustion on all sides, and the movie adds a bit of alternative history in a ghastly war gas that alt-Ludendorff was about to unleash to keep it going.) Inevitably, Diana catches up to Ludendorff and slams the god-killer through his chest. Then she looks around expecting to see everyone dropping their weapons and hugging one another, and is aghast to realize that nothing has changed. (Well, in Steve Trevor's world killing a senior general is an important strategic achievement, but she thought she was in a different sort of world.) For me this is the key moment in the movie – at this point the story is flirting with a big theme: where does evil come from? Diana has run splat into the realization that, whatever the myths of our misty origins: fear and hate and greed and stupidity are part of the world and part of us. It's an are-you-people-worth-saving moment, and Gadot delivers Diana's reaction with fierce passion.<br/><br/>I don't mind that it's a movie about a comic book character, I like big themes, and if they'd been steering the story to put a sharper point on it, I think it would have been a very fine movie, maybe even a great one. It wouldn't have needed any solemn beard-stroking, Steve Trevor isn't your philosophical dialectician, but I think they could have found just a few more well-written lines for them to put the point in high relief. I think they just missed the bullseye.<br/><br/>Of course she decides to deal with humankind as it is, not as she thought it should be.<br/><br/>At the end, they decided this must be a standard superhero movie, so there has to be a grand blow 'em up finale when Ares shows up in person, and there's the requisite array of explosions and lightning bolts. Ares goes nyahaha, surrender to the darkside, and she discovers her full powers and blasts him into a smoking crater. And then! – the handful of soldiers in the area who have survived the blast wave stand up, look around in a daze and start hugging each other. Argh. Thereby trivializing the lesson we've just gone to a deal of trouble to learn. Fortunately that moment passes quickly.<br/><br/>The story is leavened with some nice fish-out-of-water moments as she adjusts to 1918 London, and her charge across the lethal no-man's land between the trenches will be the iconic moment from this movie. Accepting for the moment that even movies about comic superheroes have a place, we can take satisfaction that a female superhero has joined the A-list. I enjoyed it. It almost made it to the top rung."

","I'll start by saying that while I've given an 8, it's actually more of an 8.5+ (but not a 9).<br/><br/>I hadn't been looking forward to this... Despite the trailer looking good, memories of previous DC universe movies put me off - do I really want to see a po-faced movie about an Amazonian goddess? Well, OK so I admit the prospect of seeing Gal all 'Wondered' up was appealing but just how appealing? Hmm...<br/><br/>So, the good reviews convinced me. No too ways about it, if this had received bad reviews I'd have not touched it with a barge pole but phew! All is good in the world again :)<br/><br/>I really don't want to give away anything, I just want people to go see the movie because it is genuinely one of the best superhero movies in recent years and I think it's all down to the amount of humour they've injected - remember those laughs from Superman and Superman Vs Batman? No? That's because there weren't any and jeez they were boring...<br/><br/>To sum the movie up, it's well written, directed, acted and shot* so really do just go see it and thank me later!<br/><br/>*Ok, small caveat - some of the special effects are laughable but as the script is quite witty it's easy to loom beyond them, no really - you'll see ;)"
"Sadiddy","8","0","5","4 June 2017"," It's pretty good; The best out of Zank Snyder-verse
","First, I want to say I think Man of Steel and Batman vs. Superman are okay. They aren't great, but certainly aren't as bad as critics and many fans try to make them out to be. They remind me of the Star Wars prequels in that way. You can pick any movie apart if you try.<br/><br/>With that said, Wonder Woman is better than those two films. It's still not the best movie EVERRRR like some will try to say, but it's pretty good. Reminded me plenty of Captain America which is a good thing because Captain America is the best film series in MCU. Worth my $18 ticket, but I have no desire to see it again in the theater."

","'Wonder Woman' lassos her way onto the big screen as DC unleashes it's 4th film of it's extended universe. With acclaimed female director Patty Jenkins at the helm, does this film finally surpass the critical stomping of both 'Dawn of Justice' and 'Suicide Squad'?<br/><br/>1. To be perfectly blunt, 'Wonder Woman' indeed (with the exception of 'Man of Steel') lifts the depressing curtain of the DCEU. This film exceeded my expectations by far and no one could wipe the proud smile off my face leaving the theater. After Superman flew across the sky in 2013, it took DC four years to raise the bar back up to a level in which I thought 'Man of Steel' succeeded (as far as origin stories go). Was it a flawless movie?......No. Does it succeed in parts where it's good?......in spades. When Wonder Woman/Diana Prince made her debut in 'Dawn of Justice', I can honestly say that I wasn't that impressed, nor was I a fan of Gal Gadot since I thought of her as a mediocre actress at best. However, I'm often glad to be proved wrong.<br/><br/>2. Having Zack Snyder (Man of Steel/Dawn of Justice) and David Ayer (Suicide Squad) at the reins up to this point, it took a woman like Patty Jenkins to finally turn things around. With 'Monster' being her claim to directorial fame, Jenkins will definitely be remembered for this now, as well she should be. Of course Gal Gadot will be the most outstanding hero of the DCEU, that is unless Aquaman, The Flash or Green-Lantern decide to steal the show in their respective films lol. Even tho I still think her acting is not on the level of great, Gadot does manage herself well enough to were I genuinely felt for her character as the film progressed. Being a guy, it's kinda hard to relate to a female lead based on my gender, but it doesn't divert from how good I thought she was.<br/><br/>3. However, the true acting spirit and the most relatable character to me, was Chris Pine as Cpt. Steve Trevor. Even though it's easy to get lost in his blue eyes, Pine steals every scene he's in and his chemistry with Gadot is easily better than that of Superman & Lois Lane. For the first time in this universe was I caught up in the love-story, and Chris Pine is just a beautiful man altogether;) Reading my review so far, you'd think my rating should be higher, but as I mentioned earlier, the film has flaws. Mainly....the villains, not the best, pretty weak and lazy; that's how I'd describe them. Apart from Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya) and Gen. Ludendorff (Danny Huston), there is a third antagonist who is revealed during the climax, but my review is spoiler free.<br/><br/>4. As with every DCEU climax, this one is no different as it boils down to a CGI-fest for the final sequence. Even though it's more focused than the other films' climax battles, it sorta (but not completely) takes away from the emotion the movie was trying to convey at that point. I'll admit that there was a moment in the last action sequence that got me a little teary-eyed in which Steve and Diana talk. The last time I cried was in 'Man of Steel' and I'm not too proud to admit it. Despite the heavy use of slow-motion shots in the very first action sequence when the Amazons storm the beach, everything from then on works really well. Audiences can now see the sheer power Wonder Woman possesses along with her superhuman skill- set and combat abilities.<br/><br/>I wish I could give this film a higher rating than I have, but with time to reflect, there were just some unforgivable errors made in which the DC filmmakers should have picked up on, seeing as how it costed them in the past. All in all, I had a great time, and despite it's flaws, 'Wonder Woman' was indeed a success."
"tfc","7","0","5","3 June 2017"," Wonder Woman is a very good movie worth watching. Just ignore the few irritating potholes in the road and save the villain for later
","Wonder Woman (2017) (WW) is a very good movie worth watching. So many of the positive reviews already detail all the positives aspects of WW so will not do a rehash of a good movie. I give it 7/9 but believe it could have easily reached 8/9. There were a few minor potholes in the highway I felt distracted me during the movie. The main distraction was the long love scene after the battle at the front. WW should have simply said no to Steve Trevor's advances, told him to wait after the war because he proved himself in battle, and Amazons are professional warriors. Not only would this kept the movie up to speed, this would have made Trevor's death a bigger emotional impact at the movie's end on WW and the audience. Several slowdowns (down shifts in plot speed) like this during the second half tempted me to look at my watch which is a sign that my mind was starting to drift. Then there was the final coup de grace battle which seemed comic book predictable, a little too over the top, and bordered on exhaustion. This damped a good plot twist by the villain Aries being an ordinary human in an upper leadership role. An additional twist I thought would have been interesting is what would WW do (WWWWD) if Aries said no to a fight with WW? After all, he was only talking to people and they freely chose to follow his advice, he was unarmed, and he was still disabled from his fight from Zeus. So WWWWD to Aries being an Amazon warrior if he refused to fight and he walked away (Later causing WWII, Cold War, ...)? But you cannot let the bad guy win and walk free. Again these are only my personal preferences on a good movie that could easily be smoothed over or added in the DVD release."
"Kelevra770","6","0","5","3 June 2017"," A win for a franchise that desperately needed it
","I went into this movie feeling 2 things, the first being scepticism and the second optimism. Having read some very good reviews and seeing the resounding positive feedback for the film on the likes of Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb I wondered whether this was a film being over- hyped simply because of the female lead or that this was in fact going to be a very good movie, however being a huge comic book film fan I was optimistic that I was going to be wrong. Which I was. to as certain extent.<br/><br/>So let's talk about the positive aspects of this film, the first being the excellent portrayal of Wonder Women by Gal Gadot. After our first glimpse of the Amazonian in the not well received Batman vs Superman it was hard to tell whether Gadot was going to be a good choice for the role, however her performance in this film put all of those doubts to bed. Not only does the actress physically look the part but Gadot also strikes a really good balance between independence and naivety as she comes to terms with her new surroundings of World War I. It's great that not only do we finally have a good female super hero lead film but also a role model for young girls within the ever growing popularity of the comic book film genre.<br/><br/>One of the main issues that this current DCEU has been heavily criticised for is the tone and theme of each movie with both Man of Steel and more so Batman vs Superman being labelled as ""too dark"". Wonder Women however gets the tone absolutely spot on with the movie managing to do a great job of demonstrating the horrors of World War I and integrating it with humour, heart and conveys important messages quite prevalent in today's society. In addition to this, the cinematography and the way the film is shot is absolutely stunning. I had the opportunity to see the film in IMAX and the shots of Themyscira especially were incredible.<br/><br/>With Man of Steel being heavily criticised for its fight choreography it was important that this was addressed and well executed in Wonder Women and although not perfect, is still very well done in this movie. In a number of scenes we see WW acrobatically taking down soldiers in which the hits feel hard and real and there is a good blend of real movement and CGI. The only issue I had with the fight scenes, which is more of a personal preference, is that there was too much slow motion used. Personally I felt that the scenes where there was only a couple of slow motion shots used, conveyed the speed and strength of WW much better.<br/><br/>The biggest criticism I can give this film is how it ends. Personally I felt that the ""Join me or I'll destroy you"" mantra of the main villain Aries is extremely overused in this genre already and although it doesn't ruin the film, I was hoping for something a bit more. Especially with the plot twists in this film being fairly obvious. I also found the scene after Aries is defeated incredibly cheesy with German and British soldiers hugging and chatting after spending the last 20 minutes slaughtering each other with gun fire. I obviously understand that the war was happening due to Aries's grip on mankind and that grip had now been released, however I just felt like the scenes of celebration in London would have sufficed and made it slightly more believable.<br/><br/>Danny Huston's portrayal of Lundendorff I also found to be very weak. Although Huston has had success playing villains in other movies before I just couldn't understand why they didn't cast a German actor to play the role as the German accent of Huston in this film was extremely poor. Only a minor negative but one I couldn't get passed.<br/><br/>My final issue with the movie was the run time. Standing at 2 hours 21 minutes the film just felt a little too long and although I was never bored throughout the film I was very much ready for it to end. I felt that there were some aspects of the film that were either not needed or were dragged out, for example I believe we spent too much time with Diana as a child and I also felt that the scenes in present day were not needed. The whole film being a flashback felt a little cheap. Again, all stuff that didn't ruin the movie and is mainly personal preference.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Wonder Women is a very solid movie which the DCEU so desperately needed after such a rocky start. Although there is nothing ground breaking or game changing within this movie it's an excellent introduction and portrayal of the character and I'm very much looking forward to seeing how Wonder Women interacts with the other members of the Justice League in the upcoming movie. In my opinion 8.4 on IMDb is generous and I've decided to give it a very solid 7."
"DUKEJBM","Null","0","6","2 June 2017"," Copies BETTER Movies but it's not bad... a shock for a DCEU film
","I found this effort to be quite entertaining despite being unoriginal. It is interesting to break down the overall tones of the film itself because although predictable throughout, it manages to craft enough of its own spin. It really is entirely cobbled together using VERY familiar elements that we've already seen. I know her source material originated first but the movie borrows heavily from familiar narratives. The movie IS a mix/copy of Captain America: The First Avenger (HEAVILY), Thor (mythology/powers), the Hogan's Heroes TV show and a CGI video game boss battle cut scene. It's the last two elements that seriously detract from the overall rating. The conclusion literally played out like a cartoon and not a very good one. Also, the infiltration of the German party played out very ""sitcomish"" complete with everyone speaking English. <br/><br/>Still, Gal Gadot captivated me as Wonder Woman and Chris Pine was amazing as Steve. They both elevate the overall material to be honest.<br/><br/>Moving forward, the DCEU would be smart to focus more on Wonder Woman and less on the garbage we've already seen. The only negative I see is that they made her overwhelmingly powerful. That can be a huge problem in the future not only when facing enemies but with consistency. Even in this film it was all over the place in terms of her power. One scene she is straining to lift her own body weight and the next she literally lifts a tank over her head."
"kaptenvideo-89875","7","0","8","1 June 2017"," Looks really good, old-fashioned in a good way, and the two stars are charming
","Before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana (Gal Gadot), princess of the Amazons. When a pilot on the run (Chris Pine) crashes near their island paradise and tells of conflict in the outside world, she leaves home to fight a war to end all wars. Yes, another superhero movie, and the titular heroine is not a minor one. WW made her first comics appearance in October 1941 and has been in publication almost continuously after that. Constant reader has probably noticed that superhero movies are not my cup of tea, mostly because of lack of originality. So many of them are origin stories, like we really cared about how they came about. So many are shamelessly copying each other on grassroots level, especially 2001's Iron Man"" which established a blueprint that no one wants to deviate from. And I'm especially tired of big fights which are always consisting of flying through air and punching each other, destroying stuff in the process, including houses. How many times do I have to watch the same f*cking thing, year after year? Having said that, I actually quite like the Wonder Woman"" movie. It looks really good, old-fashioned in a good way, and the two leading stars are charming. Chris Pine is effective as the new Indiana Jones era Harrison Ford the world has been waiting for. But most of the attention and praise goes to Gal Gadot as Diana. She's just wonderful indeed: beautiful, in good ass-kicking shape and also good at displaying subtle sense of humor which goes long way when the Amazon princess has to meet the modern world (during the World War I). My biggest concern is the quite lenghty final chapter of the story where the bad guy comes into play. In this part of the movie one can't deny anymore that the main character's philosophy is shallow and underdeveloped even by the standards of Facebook Deep we live in. And the final battle is, of course, as generic as they come in modern superhero movies, consisting mostly flying through air and punching each other, destroying stuff in the process. Remember how Charlize Theron got an Oscar for 2003's Monster""? This is actually the director Patty Jenkins's first movie job after that, in the meantime she has done mostly TV and this one anthology. Welcome back, great job!"
