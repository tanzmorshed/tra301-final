","I was a fan of the ""V for Vendetta"" graphic novel, and Alan Moore disinheriting the film was a bit discouraging. But he's always been a little crazy. The film version is everything I could have possibly hoped for - gripping, chilling, intense, exciting, heartbreaking. It gets Moore's music if not his exact words; elements are slightly different, subplots removed. But the idea - as V himself would be so proud to say - remains the same.<br/><br/>The plot is surprisingly complex and nuanced, and I don't want to give anything more away than the previews already have. Suffice it to say that a masked anarchist (voiced by Hugo Weaving) must save a young woman (Natalie Portman) during his attempt to expose corruption in the government. Weaving is perfectly cast, using his formidable physicality and imposing voice to give gravitas to the insanity of the character. Portman has gone from child to teen star and is finally emerging as a talented, adult actress following her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Closer"". Here, she gives her best performance to date as the orphan Evey. John Hurt is characteristically impressive as the enigmatic government leader, and Stephen Rea gives a wonderful supporting turn as the police inspector charged with finding V - before it's too late.<br/><br/>The Wachowski Brothers' former protégé, James McTiegue, takes on the directing duties here and helms an enormously impressive first feature, using every trick in the book in a manner reminiscent of his mentors' breakout hit ""The Matrix"". Unlike ""The Matrix"", McTiegue allows the story to be more of a focus than the action, and as a result the film is a tense and emotional thriller, with outbursts of spectacularly filmed and choreographed action. Showing more maturity and restraint than the Wachowskis, McTiegue doesn't show off, and his trickery isn't self conscious. When slow-motion overtakes a late action sequence, it seems as natural as breathing. The late cinematographer Adrian Biddle (the film is dedicated to his memory) does an outstanding job, Oscar-nominated Dario Marianelli's score is a fantastic accompaniment to the piece, and the visual effects are astonishing, terrifying, and deeply moving, especially in the climatic moments in Trafalgar Square.<br/><br/>With solid acting, great action, and fantastic technical wizardry, it sounds just like another ""Matrix""-style ripoff. But the biggest difference in ""V"" is that it is a story of real ideas - not a fantastic, science fiction creation, but a genuine examination of the human condition. The power of fear takes center stage here - the fear of war, of disease, of famine. Fear is a basic human nature, and has been exploited as a weapon - a method of control - for centuries. And for those who would use it, a masked man waits in the shadows to carry out your sentence. The verdict? Vengeance. ""V for Vendetta"" is a must-see.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I am speechless. I just came back from the theatre, where I watched 'V for Vendetta'. There are three main elements in the movie and it excels on all three of them.<br/><br/>First off the dialogues and script. Intense, witty, honest but not patronising, intelligent but not pretentious. That's the first level at which the movie surprises you. You don't except such high level of script from an action movie. But it is slowly revealed to the audience that V for Vendetta is not just an action movie. The story is filled with current events and has a definite strong political sense.<br/><br/>Secondly Hugo Weaving's performance. It is definitely what grabs you from the start. He delivers some of the hardest lines with incredible charisma. His performance shines throughout the movie and honestly he sounds as good as any of the best actors out there. He should be nominated for an academy award.<br/><br/>Finally the visual part. Incredible, yet no ""Matrix"" effects used. Everything looks beautiful, dark yet vibrant. The cinematography is top notch. The final battle scene brought tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>Do not miss 'V for Vendetta'. It's one of the best movies of all time, an eternal classic.<br/><br/>10/10"

","""Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder treason and plot. I see no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot."" <br/><br/>I've never read the graphic novel, but I don't think you need to read it to appreciate the movie. I saw the film last night at it's World Premiere at the Berlin International Film festival. Though it became a little weighty in the middle (one part seemed to drag a little) other than that it was a great experience. The story was so topical that I got seriously emotional during a lot of parts. Weaving did an excellent job with the mysterious title character ""V"", creating a poetic, intelligent, and compassionate yet ruthless character. Portman always seems to surprise me, except with her Star Wars character. She portrays tremendous emotional range and transforms completely throughout the movie. This is one of those movies that really sticks in your head long after you watch it though... and it continues to stir and grow."
"seige-hound","10","63","74","31 October 2016"," My Personal Favourite Movie of All Time
","It's been quite a few years since I first saw V for Vendetta. I didn't see it at release, because I was far under the age demographic at that time, but I managed to catch up to the film at around 2011-2012. Not sure the exact year, but I was a teenager at the time, and I loved the Matrix (still do), and heard that V for Vendetta was written by the Wachowskis, so I thought I'd give it a shot.<br/><br/>It blew me away in many ways, and I credit the film as being part of the reason I became less homophobic and bigoted in many ways. It was the first time I saw homosexuality in a direct and positive light in the media, and it helped me immensely in establishing my more left-leaning views in the Christian world I was raised in.<br/><br/>It's for this reason I have a very deep and personal relationship with this film, but I love the film at a more enjoyable level as well. This film oozes with style. Everything from the cinematography and sound design, to the ways characters speak and act. The rather sparse use of fight scenes (in comparison to other action films of its ilk), opting rather to use political thriller tropes and character development, surprised me the first time I watched it, but even though the film wasn't as action packed as films like The Matrix or Equilibrium (both of which have massive third act spectacles) the action I feel is much more effective and emotional than either of those films (ironic, since Equilibrium is about emotion). While short, the final fight scene between V and Creedy's men is an incredible burst of ecstatic visceral action that makes the entire film worth it.<br/><br/>You can say there are three main characters in this film. There's V, the titular anarchist vigilante, Evey, the young woman who is kidnapped, and slowly falls for V in a more violent twist of Beauty and the Beast, and there's Detective Finch, a government employee tasked to finding and unmasking V, and during this task discovering that his beloved government isn't as noble as it may seem. Each of these characters is given a fair and due amount of screen time, and they each have a full and satisfactory character arc. I find how well written and edited this film is to be incredibly impressive, and writing this I want to watch the film all over again just to appreciate it more.<br/><br/>There is something to be said, however, about the differences between the film and the original graphic novel written by Alan Moore. I haven't read the original comic, but judging by Alan Moore's distaste of films inspired by his work, and the fact that he refused to watch the film after reading the script, maybe this film isn't for fans of the original work. There's a great comparison video by CineFix on Youtube comparing the film to the novel, and they are very very different from each other. One notable difference is that the portrayal of V vs the dictator Sutler is much more nuanced and less Black and white in the novel than in the film, and that is a very well deserved critique of the film. <br/><br/>I do not claim that V for Vendetta is the best film ever made. I haven't even scraped the surface of world cinema and cinema history to ever make that claim. However I can definitely say that V for Vendetta is, at least for the time being, the most personally meaningful movie, and the most enjoyable movie, I have ever seen. Mad Max Fury Road did get close though."
"GreenPlastikMan","9","1146","1483","26 February 2006"," Truly Unique
","There are some that will, upon seeing this film, say that it was akin to Andrew Lloyd Weber attempting to make a political statement: overly dramatic. These people would be well served to remember that the symbol of drama is a mask, which certainly begs one important question- Why, if you are so put off by an overtly dramatic motion picture, would you choose to see a movie that stars as the (anti)hero a man in a mask? I just saw this film at an advanced screening and I must say it is nothing short of uniquely brilliant. Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure.<br/><br/>The acting, the cinematography, the effects, and the general vision of this film all lead me to believe that it will likely receive a cult following. It is only my hope that the message of this film will come to summarize the history of our future ascendancy to true liberty.<br/><br/>Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. In the meantime, go see this movie."
"nicholasjcourville","10","62","73","2 May 2018"," Want to see where the anonymous mask came from?
","V for Vendetta is still after all these years one of my favorite movies to watch, and I find it as relevant today as it was whenever it was released in 2005. It is a story about a freedom fighter whose goal is to take down a totalitarian government that uses fear and deceit to control its people. To do this, he knows that one man is not enough to accomplish such a monumental feat and that he will need to use something that cant be silenced, hurt, or killed. he sets out with the goal of planting the idea of revolution in the people because, as he says in the movie ""Ideas are bulletproof."" 
One of my favorite things about this movie is that the main character is wearing a solid mask. It is a fantastic display of acting, both voices acting as well as physical. I guess you could say that I found myself not liking the character as much as I loved the idea of the character. The writers and director did an amazing job of drawing me into the storyline by mirroring enough of the world we live in today that I felt that the world I was watching on the screen could very easily enough being the world I live in one day. I saw myself in many of the characters and identified with their blind devotion to their country, their developing distrust of their government, and their inner conflict of trying to rationalize the two. 
Hugo Weaving plays the leading role of V and delivers and an unbelievable performance from behind a mask. Natalie Portman plays the role of V's sidekick, love, and accomplice. Stephen Rea plays the detective that is hell-bent on finding out the truth even if that means he must accept that all his life he has been on the wrong side. Many other great actors help director James McTeigue bring The Wachowski Brothers V for Vendetta to life. It is definitely worth your time. Please watch and enjoy this movie,"

","...I am well aware that my summary line invites several retorts, and given the nature of my comment those retorts may very well be resoundingly, unanimously negative. If I say ""This is one of the Best films I have ever seen..."" One would think the immediate response would be, ""Then you must not have seen many films in your time, dear boy."" Butoh I have, and it has been far too long since there has been something up on that screen in the darkened theater that I enter to leave this boring, monotonous existence that had the capacity to inspire. To see the possibilities of what might be, what could never be, and what could happen if the leaders of the world keep things going in the directions that they are headed. V For Vendetta is just a film, yes? But it is also a wake up call of which there are not enough in this time we live in. It speaks directly to the hardship that we endure but seldom take notice of because we are distracted by things that do not matter...upon leaving the theater I saw people, teenagers mostly, the very people who should be pro-actively questioning the methodical erosion of this thing called government in the modern age, react with complete apathy. Most try so hard to be so outwardly different from the rest that they do not realize that in doing this they become just like everyone else; oblivious. We as a society do not want to see films like this, we do not want to acknowledge the atrocities going on in the world, all we want to do is play our video games, watch reality television, spend our money on clothes, jewelry, entertainment. Things that for all intents and purposes we do not need. These are the distractions that keep society from pondering in the wee hours of the night what they can do to prevent true injustice. The evils committed by those that govern are far worse than any fiction the cinema can dazzle us with these days. Yes this is a truly great film and one that I will cherish for a long time. I can only hope that its message finds a wide audience that is open to seeing things from another perspective, in a uniquely human light. In the end that is what the film is about...being human. Having the capacity to choose weather or not to recognize the evils of society and take a stand to make things better than they are. The film of course takes this idea to extremes but for the viewing public dramatic examples are needed to awake them from this artificially induced state of being we call existence and say, ""I see there is wrong, and it is my duty as a human being to do what I can to make it right."" To the makers of this unique and wonderful film, I salute you."
"cosmic_quest","10","385","523","28 March 2006"," Very powerful even if it makes Thatcherism look heavenly!
","'V for Vendetta' will no doubt be remembered as being one of the most well-produced films of this decade for its powerful script, strong character depictions and the sheer excellence in terms of quality. Loosely based on the DC Comic, the film is set in a totalitarian Britain where the BNP-like government who run the country with an iron fist that they make Thatcher's Tories look positively warm and trustworthy. Then emerges a vigilante in the form of V, a man deformed by fire and the governmental experiments that have given him enhanced strength, who is determined to free the UK from dictatorship by blowing up the Houses of Parliament. Evey is the young woman who is unwittingly embroiled in his plot and soon understands what just it is that motivates V so.<br/><br/>The acting in 'V for Vendetta' was top-notch and, along with the well-written script and apt soundtrack, gave the film the essence to engage the audience and make them feel-- for better or worse-- for these characters. Although her accent was wobbly in places, Natalie Portman delivered a strong performance as Evey, depicting the character's growing love for V and the realisation that the time for her to fight has arrived. Stephen Rea also deserves a mention, as the detective who begins to grasp just how corrupt the government he has supported really is, as does Stephen Fry who proves he can do much more than play bumbling characters in his performance as Deitrich, a protester who hasn't quite grasped just how far the government will go to shut their opponents up. John Hurt's Chancellor Sutler was very terrifying as the dictator who couldn't give a toss about his people so long as he remained in total power. However, above all, it was Hugo Weaving's absolutely brilliant depiction of the lead character V who dominates. Without ever seeing his facial expression, he exudes the pragmatism, charisma and intelligence of the character with a twist of revenge-driven madness.<br/><br/>Entertainment-wise, the film doesn't fail with it's apt soundtrack and well choreographed fight scenes that do remind you that this was based on a comic book. Yet 'V for Vendetta' maintains the ability to leave the audience shaken and chilled at the thought of how easily a Western country can be ensnared by tyranny when a corrupt government is allowed too much power and goes too far. The elements dealt with are all the more disturbing with the state of the world today. I imagine it will touch a deeper cord with Britons like myself (it would have been interesting to see more on how Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had fared in this new world though) as it is so rare that a Hollywood film is set in the UK. It's always simpler to pretend these things could never happen here so it is a sharp shock to see such a dark future located in familiar surroundings of home.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film to all as it will leave you both entertained and pondering matters raised in the storyline long after the credits have rolled up."

"samseescinema","9","560","805","14 March 2006"," a vividly vivacious and voluptuous volley of a very violently fun time
","V for Vendetta <br/><br/>rating: 3.5 out of 4<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a swift and smugly entertaining portrait of revolution. Albeit, this is a Wachowski Brothers revolution, meaning there must be wildly theatric heroes and crisply tailored CGI stunts all set comfortably in an oppressive Totalitarian society. But this is more than The Matrix with a Victorian flare. V for Vendetta offers up a convincing vision of the near-future paired with an operatic comic book tale of love, mystery, and a Guy-Fawkes-masked rebellion. <br/><br/>Our hero is V (Hugo Weaving), a masked terrorist with a mind for the subversive, a taste for the eloquent, and a hand for knife-wielding acrobatics. His accidental apprentice (or maybe hostage) is Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman V saved from the fondling grasps of corrupt Fingermen (kind of the CIA for the V for Vendetta world) as she hurried across town past curfew. Our oppressor in this world is High Chancellor Stutler (John Hurt), whose persona is shown primarily through a five-story tall projection of his ever-angry head. The exposition for this near-future lies mostly in the implosion of America after the middle-eastern war expanded into a world war that reached its tendrils even through Western Europe. America folded into civil strife while Britain became the final bastion of modern civilization after a biological attack isolated the island into a zone of quarantine. Stutler rose to power in the chaos and now rules Britain with the mantra ""England Prevails!"" Rest assured, however, this is not a reality governed by rolling robots and giant overhead blimps; it's a world that's, instead, very similar to ours. The technological innovations are hidden subtly into the film's environment, refusing to take precedent over the historically opulent flavors of England's architecture. V for Vendetta has a flare for the theatric and operatic, after all. There's no room for bleeping robots and bounding technology. <br/><br/>On the eve of November 5th, when Britain traditionally celebrated freedom and truth, V launches a subversive plot to topple High Chancellor Stutler and his surrounding administration. Hijacking the British Television Network, he broadcasts a speech that sets the date one year from November 5th as the date of the revolution. Our story takes place in the interim year leading up to the supposed revolution, with the evolution of Evey's politics, the ongoing vendetta V has set against the players of a mysterious government plot, and the deepening hole V digs for Stutler and his boys to stumble into once that fateful date arrives. ""Remember, remember the fifth of November."" <br/><br/>What separates V's rebellion from the teeming hordes of other cinematic coupe d'etats made over the years is that V for Vendetta approaches the topic with one eye held straight at the politics of the present. Hot button headline topics continually rear their heads here. Bush is paralleled to Stutler, the news media is heavily clouded, our hero is paired with images of suicide bombers and subway attacks; not to mention the undeniable fact that we are asked to sympathize with an outright terrorist. Is terrorism justified when paired against a strict oppressor? In the political climate of today--where the title of terrorism is threatening to mirror the clout McCarthy granted the title of Communism--V for Vendetta's answer to that question is a sure-handed yes. <br/><br/>But V for Vendetta is no heavy-handed political allegory. At its heart, V for Vendetta is entertainment. And as any entertainment with a hand in Victorian elegance, V for Vendetta must have romance. But before you conjure images of the Fawkes mask flying in a sweaty bald-headed scene of lust, realize first that there also is a master-grasshopper dynamic between Evey and V. The romance is formed as an understatement and rarely addressed, let to simmer below the surface and lend more chemistry to scenes that would otherwise ring hollow.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman may have stolen the tabloid exposure with her shiny shaved head, but Hugo Weaving is the masked performance that steals the show. Much of the role's success lies in the writing, for V is made not to be simply a mask. There's a theme throughout the film asking whether behind masks of revolution, there lie fighting men and women, or only their ideals. V answers this question with charisma. Contradicting the common mantra that masked figures must be laconic, V, in fact, probably has the most lines of all. The character is full and rich with quirks and personality, but still exists with that essential air of mystery. Weaving achieves the same level of iconic performance that he did with Agent Smith in The Matrix. It really is that good.<br/><br/>There's been debate over the quality of adaptation the Wachowski Brothers offered to Alan Moore's original graphic novel. Moore has publicly separated himself from the film, quoting in the New York Times last week that ""the screenplay's rubbish."" Well, before we all walk away from the ticket line, remember primly that Alan Moore will be the first to tell you himself that he is a selfish, pretentious prick. He knows it, and we know it. Let's move on. The screenplay's fine. In fact, it's a near-masterpiece. What the Wachowski Brothers have done is find the right balance between the theatrics of the graphic novel, and the solemnity to the richly Victorian narrative. They form a dynamic that plays to both sides, allowing for a story that sparks both political debate and giddy entertainment. We'll first shake our heads at the sentimental, soft-focus flashbacks and silly sub-plot for ""nuclear human experimentation""; but when mulled over, we realize it's just the comic book mentality showing its spots. After all, V wouldn't start all his sentences with v-words had this film shunned its comic roots. And anyway, V for Vendetta is a vividly vivacious and voluptuous volley of a very violently fun time."

","This marks the fantastic return of the Wachowski brothers.Those who were disappointed with their last two efforts will not be disappointed here,there is no doubt that the Brothers are talented.Here they make their comeback.But not as filmmakers,but as producers and writers.And to be honest ,this film thrills you from beginning to end.You'll be blown away with this adrenaline excitement and dramatically intense thriller.<br/><br/>A finely complex storyline about V, a reluctant freedom fighter , a rebellion who fights for freedom against the government in London in another time line.Set against the futuristic landscape of totalitarian Britain,a mild-mannered young woman named Evey who is rescued from a life-and-death situation by""V."" Incomparably charismatic and ferociously skilled in the art of combat and deception, V urges his fellow citizens to rise up against tyranny and oppression. As Evey uncovers the truth about V's mysterious background, she also discovers the truth about herself--and emerges as his unlikely ally in the culmination of his plot to bring freedom and justice back to a society fraught with cruelty and corruption.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the first and fully realized and most successful of all the Moore adaptations.What I liked about this film was the way it balances action and drama.The script is fantastic and directing is equally worth a mention.The assistant director on the Matrix(James McTeigue) movies really has some talent ,and handles the action and drama very well.The film is fast paced and exciting.It is also politically charged and quite controversial but that is the point.It makes you think about the current situation, how well is the government handling the situation of terrorism.V serves as an anti-hero on a quest of freedom.His actions are right but his methods are wrong,he is trying to bring about a message in the wrong way.<br/><br/>This film focuses on the source material of the book, more on the characters than on the action.More on the emotions and the drama than on the violence.This film doesn't glorify V as a terrorist but shows that under certain circumstances he was tempted to be what he is.The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughout,never once boring,an apocalyptic future setting really heightens the tension with starkly dark set designing and stunning cinematography.The action is striking and the performances in the drama are standout.This is a terrific movie at all points, it has a strong script , impressive directing and commendable performances.But having read the book after the movie,I must confess this film is still nowhere close to being better than the book.No way.It feels incomplete adaptation,leaving a lot of details behind,whereas the book had a more in depth look at V's life and his relationship with Evey.But I guess the filmmakers wanted to take a different approach,to which they succeed completely.<br/><br/>There is a reference or close resemblance to Guatanamo prison and 9/11 issues echoes throughout the film.And it made the film even more direct.There are several more references to our world dominated by politics and government,regarding terrorism.And what they do to secure their safety.This is one thing that makes V so controversial.His actions will make you think he's insane,but it's just an idea,a notion that alerts us to take actions if our own Government ever try to control us,and inflict fear into our lives. <br/><br/>Hidden behind the creepy mask ,Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor.His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystopian future ,and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance.Portman on the other hand also excels,with a convincing accent.She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well.The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled.The rest of the film is superb in its execution.<br/><br/>V is an idea,a symbol,a metaphor that cannot be destroyed.A man can be obliterated but as an idea,an icon he is indestructible and his message becomes more powerful to convey as people look upon this figure ,but not the man beneath it.One man can make a huge difference but united men and women can change something.And that's what made me respond to this film's ideas.It's full of it.Shed with technical and visual brilliance.<br/><br/>A spellbinding adventure , exciting action, superb directing and writing and a Sci-Fi film with a thoughtful message,and the first fully satisfying Moore adaptation.This film is the most controversial and at the same time breathtaking Action/thriller.A terrific achievement produced by the Wachowskis' and Silver.The climax,especially,was uplifting and beautifully executed.And will live on to be one of the most memorable conclusions.It always get me.<br/><br/>If there's anything out there in the theaters that will blow you away before summer season kicks off ,then this is a blast for you."

There was no Batman/Bryce Wayne, there was only V and because of that it made him more of a myth and much more intriguing for what he stood for.<br/><br/>Vengence is in the title, but it so much more than that with a deeper meaning that rivals some of the best in Hollywood. I found myself reading more into the ""idea"" V represented. Now one of my favorite Comic Book Films."

","To sum up the brothers' masterwork in one word is a quite impossible task, but I have come to the conclusion that V For Vendetta is 'perfect'. Nathalie Portman as the hapless chick is one weak link because she is not a good actress and her English accent is as bad as the Bridget Jones Diaries but the rest if just brilliant. Making this film all the more compelling is the classical music perfectly composed original musical score. This film deserves all the cult love bestowed upon it, especially the social movements it has aided. It deserves all these awards and more. V For Vendetta is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. The good guys and the bad guys are so complex, so scary and so relevant that it will remain an immortal film forever. Homosexuals, Muslims, freedom fighters, media folk, cops, politicians and regular folks who believe life is just drinking beer and being stupid will benefit from watching this."

","The movie V for Vendetta promotes a government in which the people decide what is best for the country, and their livelihoods. Throughout the film, it becomes clear that a close to perfect form of society is when the government is scared of its people, not the other way around. In addition, the concept that love can overcome evil is evident. The hero of this film is a woman named Evey Hammond, whose goal is to help a man called V to take down the over oppressive, and corrupt, government. However, just like any hero, Evey has a flaw, and that flaw is fear to take action since her parents were killed for rebelling against the government. Evey was captured and tortured by the government to reveal the identity of V, but she never did. After a long period of time, and being constantly tortured, all her options seemed exhausted, but she rids fear within herself and accepts her fate. She would rather die then let the government stop the revolution. Luckily, it was actually V who captured and tortured her to see if she was truly loyal. The final showdown results in the death of V, however, with her new found strength, Evey completes the final step in the revolution in which the parliament building is blown up. Evey conquered her fear, and she now knows she has the power and the courage to change the world. With the parliament building destroyed, the people are now taking back their freedom, and will most likely form a government in which their voice matters. 
The movie includes a few main scenes that, when looked at together, are important in proving the message of the story: any injustice only takes a single person, willing to risk everything, to spark a world altering revolution. To reveal the corruption of the government, the viewers witness the police's attempt to rape Evey. The very people who are supposed to protect the citizens are the ones causing the most damage. In addition, a scandal in which the government purposely infected children with a deadly virus that only they could cure is shown. This proves the corruption of the government, and, now, all there needs to be is the rebellion. V's single man invasion in a TV building allows him to be known throughout the country, and, this simple act gains him followers, more fighters. The releasing of the mask, hat, and cape that he wears to every citizen might just be the most influential scene because this act gives the citizens something they never had before: a choice. Lastly, the final scene where thousands of citizens gathered, dressed in V attire, and push their way through the police to witness the destruction of parliament. I agree with the theme portrayed in this film because it shows how humans, though extremely different form one another, are able to come together when the time calls for it. I believe that this is a hopeful movie that lets the viewers know that they have more power than they think; a government cannot function without the support of its people. In all honesty, I would not have portrayed the movie any differently. The film was extremely intense, graphically violent, and painfully realistic; however, this intensity was needed to get the point across that there a corrupt government needs to be stopped. 
The redemption that is portrayed in the film coincides with biblical truth in that they both end with the sacrifice of one to free the many from the evil. In the same way V risks his life so that the rest of the country may live in freedom, Jesus died on the cross so that the entire world could be saved and washed from their sins. Although the biblical truth is a much larger scale, the concept is the same. However, the movie departs from biblical truth in what actions V does in order to achieve freedom for the people. V takes on a more hateful and violent approach in which he assassinates corrupt government people, and bombs the parliament building. On the other hand, Jesus takes on a more humbling approach in which he basically shows kindness and unconditional love to all. Although V for Vendetta condemns evil, it also allows the viewers to think that the only way to destroy evil is with more evil and violence. The intense violence in the film contradicts V's ultimate goal which is to rid of the violent and corrupt government. V is fighting fire with fire, but he is doing what he feels is right and what he sees as the only way to achieve freedom. 
This connects to the worldview of post modernism because the idea of breaking from the traditional rules, or the rules of the past, and doing what you believe in, or what you feel is right, is promoted. The film does not directly explore this worldview, rather, it reveals this concept through V and his actions. V wants to create a world in which people have the choice to choose what to believe in. In addition, he does whatever actions he deems necessary to achieve his goal. Similarly, post modernists believe that people should have the right to believe what they want, and do whatever they want, and that what they do is their choice. Given this mentality, I think that the writers are trying to say that humans should never be forced to believe in something. What we choose to believe in is our choice, and each person should respect one other regardless of their beliefs. If one thing is for sure, people typically do not like to be told what to do because for some reason we like choice, and how we live reflects our beliefs. This obviously does not reflect the teachings of the Bible. The Bible is pretty clear that in order to get to heaven, if you even believe in one, is, in summary, to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior. V for Vendetta neither denounces nor promotes the Bible or Christianity. V does not care what you believe in, he cares that you were able to choose you beliefs without any pressure. This is, however, similar to the Bible in that people have the free will to choose what they believe(you can believe in Jesus or not); there is no outside pressure, at least there is not supposed to be any. The Bible lays out its case to all who are willing to listen, and people can accept or deny its teachings; V is fighting for exactly this, the ability to choose. Christianity is not portrayed in this movie because this is not a movie about religion, but it does indirectly comment on religion. It reveals the dangers of religions and how they can turn into corrupt political systems that take away a persons choice. Every religion is guilty of trying to pressure others into their belief, or there will be consequences. The film calls out any guilty of this sort of pressure, and it basically comments this: people need to make their own decisions, and if there is disagreement, oh well, it was their choice, not yours.
Overall, V for Vendetta is not the most child friendly movie. It is extremely violent, in more ways than one, and the negative elements greatly out weight the positive. Some negative elements included an attempted rape, multiple murdered, lots of gun violence, torture, and encourages dangerous behavior. This movie definitely teaches that it is acceptable to do an measures necessary to fight for a cause, even if people's well beings are at stake. On a more positive note, the final message of the movie is inspiring. It teaches that it is ok to be different, and that people should have the free will to decided who they want to be; it inspires individuality. Even with a beautiful message at the very end, this film should not be recommended to everyone because of the negative elements states earlier in this paragraph. In this day in age, I think it would be acceptable that the minimum age to introduce this movie would be 13. At this age, children are beginning to be introduced to the real world, and they are just starting to figure out who they are. I think that this movie is a good introduction into teaching kids that it is okay to believe differently than others, but, most importantly, that people should not be judged for believing in something different."

","Remember remember the fifth of November When I first watched V for Vendetta I didn't know much about it. However I have always had a fascination with darker comic book movies such as The Crow and some of the Batman's. I am going start by saying that the character of V played brilliantly by Hugo Weaving is one of those characters that will be remembered and is an instance classic. This in truth is 1 of my favourite Natalie Portman performances, she is just so full of determination and curiosity and it's infectious. The scene where V and Evey first meat is truly tremendous. V saves Evey from some men trying to rough her up, she does hold her ground, V shows off some kick ass moves and a very versatile vocabulary (see what I did there). One of favourite things about V is he is an antihero yet he still views himself as a sort of freedom fighter who is standing up for the opposing government. The reason why I love this movie so much is the true determination to do what is right and the casualties that had to happen. V was a broken body but a free soul that wanted to make a difference and he did so. Was everything planned, I don't know but all I know is this movie is a must watch and truly is amazing"

The execution of technical aspects is sound throughout. Cinematography envelops the images with a bleak tone & dismal aura to illustrate life under totalitarian rule while taut editing, variegated score & brisk velocity make the viewing experience more intense & visceral.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, V for Vendetta viciously combines elements of cautionary tale, politically charged drama & action extravaganza into a visually stunning & thought-provoking cinema that provides a voice to the voiceless, and is a valid & vociferous reminder that every society has the vim n vigour to dismantle any venal regime that violates its volition. Much more relevant today than it was at its time of release, this dystopian political thriller is by all means an essential viewing."

There is something about V which stirs the spirit, and those who place it among the greatest are simply able to overlook its faults in the way that hope springs eternal. And anger punches the air.<br/><br/>Everyone needs a saviour, and with the aplomb of Zorro, self- sacrifice of Christ and the righteousness of Batman, V makes heroes of us all, shoulder to shoulder. It's a fantasy of the enlightened that their fellow citizens, even if at the eleventh hour, come to share that enlightenment.<br/><br/>I cannot see how The British, and particularly Londoners like me, can watch the shots of an army of masked, smiling revolutionaries marching shoulder to shoulder through the streets of the capital amidst the architectural symbols of power and not be emotionally overwhelmed.

","Or ""V for Versatility""? <br/><br/>Indeed, when it doesn't warn about the risk of totalitarianism pending over democracies, through the Orwellian depiction of a Britain ruled by a Big Brother-like figure, yelling orders on a giant wall-size screen, and played by John Hurt,""V"" is a captivating cat-and-mouse chase between the rebels and the armed hands of the Law, characterized by two opposites: Stephen Rea as the good cop Finch and Tim Piggot-Smith as Creedy, the overzealous fascist with an ugly mug.<br/><br/>Of course, the main attraction of the film is the titular V, that justice warrior hiding behind the now-iconic Guy Fawkes' mask and signing, like a modern-day Zorro, all his deeds with the mark V. As easy with words as he is with knives, V is a really fascinating creation we owe to the genius of comic-book artist Alan Moore. He makes his entrance when a young woman, coincidentally named Evey (Natalie Portman), breaks the curfew and is assaulted by two members of a local militia named 'Fingermen'. V doesn't believe in coincidences and sees in Evey the light of hope to shine on the future generations. Together, they meet on the 5th of November, and as a homage to the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, when Catholics attempted to destroy the House of Parliament, V orchestrates the destruction of the Old Prison.<br/><br/>And with 1812 Tchaikovski Overture as an accompaniment, ""orchestrates"" is the right word. The opening scene sums up what makes ""V for Vendetta"" a great entertainment, it is both visually and intellectually captivating. It is the kind of experiences that urge you to go to Wikipedia so some extra knowledge can make the plot a little more understandable, and sometimes, plausible. For instance, I live in France where, recently, the government revealed the existence of a big database containing 60 Millions of names, which means the entire French population. This comes within the framework of the fight against terrorism but when you think deeper, you realize that a government will always have a ""good reason"". In ""V for Vendetta"", we discover the extents of the tyranny: banning and killing homosexuals, Muslims, communist or atheists, and it is revealed near the end that it started with a 'virus' plot.<br/><br/>I don't see Illuminati everywhere, I know that some conspiracy theories are absurd but they shouldn't be used as an alibi against those that make sense and can be proved. The merit of James McTeigue's film is not to denounce something that might happen but to tell us that it might happen. The film was made in 2005, after the September 11 attacks, but the events prove them right, I just love a part where Finch, disillusioned, know that things will go out of control, starting with an incident that will give an excuse for the government to bring the army. That's how the Arab Springs begun and today, it changed the map of the world, for better and for worse, the worse is that it planted the seed of terrorism and Islamophobia in European countries. If there ever is a Third World War, it would be ignited by these two elements.<br/><br/>I just read a complaint from a IMDb user about the positive way the Quran was depicted, and I was wondering if that comment didn't prove that hatred was already marching in. It's very interesting that a character played in the film was killed because he had a Quran, if you look at the perception of Islam today, due to events that are certainly not caused by the vast majority but a fanatic minority manipulated by foreign groups and God knows who, you'll see that we're not far from this reality. Ironically, for all its positive portrayal of Muslims as victims or camp-candidates (a similitude shared with the other visionary Sci-fi movie ""Children of Men""), religion is painted in a negative light, starting with the Bishop portrayed as a filthy pedophile.<br/><br/>The standing the films seems to take is that the first victims will be minorities and the film even includes a poignant lesbian romance in the story. But who knows, maybe the real dictatorship will come from hyper capitalism that would ban every form of spirituality. The fluidity of the plot sometimes derails in order to make a political statement, and I wish the film took more time to be a political satire than a Manichean thriller. It is also ambiguous in the way it denounces a form of totalitarian violence while portraying violence as the means to an end. The most glorious moment of the film, was the magnificent street marching with all London inhabitants wearing the Fawkes' mask, and when the soldiers had surrendered, V had virtually won.<br/><br/>So, did we need to see Big Ben destroyed? The people had seized the power, it was a revolution per se, and by inspiring them, the figure of V has achieved more than any other terrorist attack. But it felt like the director needed to end the film in a blaze of glory, and close the loop. It was spectacular but a tad predictable while something less flashy could have been more meaningful. ""V for Vendetta"" is never boring but it needlessly overplays the effects although it had everything to blow your mind, even the last speech by Natalie Portman gives you the perfect idea about the character, he's an idea precisely.<br/><br/>And this is indeed an idea that prevailed, as the Guy Fawkes mask became the inspiration for the ""Anonymous"" group, creating a case where fiction preceded reality, and underlined its own prophetic aspect. The film isn't flawless but it is a must see in our difficult times, and I'm glad I could finally review it 11 years after its release and 11 years before the time these events will happen, now in 2016, on the 5th of November."
"stancube","10","88","160","18 March 2006"," V for Very Misunderstood
","While critics scratch their heads at questions like, ""Can a terrorist be a hero?"" and ""How could one man do everything V does?"", they miss the metaphor, and the point, of V for Vendetta.<br/><br/>V at one point in the film says, ""...ideas are bulletproof."" The idea of this film is that unless the citizens of a country question their government's spin and propaganda, they will succumb to the policies of that government no matter how wrong-minded those policies may be.<br/><br/>I'm sure it's difficult for pigeon-holing critics to accept a Wachowski Brothers script that doesn't revolve around the action sequences, but investigates the castigation of an entire society using engaging dialogue and intense, involving characters. And after the Matrix sequels, this is somewhat understandable. However, V for Vendetta not only surpasses those disastrous sequels, but the original Matrix as well in terms of cohesiveness and depth.<br/><br/>This film must be a nightmare realized on screen for Republicans and conservatives the world over. They would have to label all of the non-government characters as ""unpatriotic"", and V himself an insane terrorist. They probably don't understand that he represents every free-thinking citizen of the world who is concerned about the actions and policies of his/her government, even though this point is made several times in the film. Further, they probably don't understand that the violent actions of V and his compatriots are symbolic of everything from peaceful protests over the War in Iraq to Senator Russ Feingold's resolution to censure President Bush. On second thought, they probably do see this comparison, and believe these non-violent actions to be just as outrageous as the blowing up of government buildings!<br/><br/>Discussions of governments gone awry aside, V for Vendetta is a rock-solid film that kept me riveted and unblinking for the entire 132 minutes.

","It is the year 2020. England is reigned by a fascist government, ensuring safety at the expense of freedom. How did it come this far? Not by a hostile takeover it seems, the British voted for it. But they voted under the influence of the most powerful force in the world - Fear. Some may argue that love is more powerful, but even love can be conquered by the fear of losing someone dear to yourself.<br/><br/>This is the scenery that is painted by James McTeigue. But there is one who opposes it: V. Wearing a Guy Fawkes Mask, blowing up the old Bailey, attacking those who build this regime. It is not just V's biography that is told in this movie though. He's more than person, he stands for an idea maybe an ideal and we watch the story unfold around him as he guides us through London. Main characters are the absolutely wonderful Evey played by Natalie Portman and the inspector hunting V (Stephen Rea), slowly realizing that too many coincidences have happened in the past. V himself, played by Hugo Weaving never shows his face, but still convinces and puts on a great show.<br/><br/>The message this movie sends is (and no doubt has been hundreds of times) to be debated as it glorifies chaos and the rebelling against the government even though the people do not know of the horrors their government has committed to gain power. But then again, do we know all about our government? Thankfully the movie dodges the problem of having a government overthrown only because of the revenge of one man and focuses on the essential: Act if you think there's something wrong.
Combine this idea with a dagger wielding masked man whose speeches could have made him a poet in a normal life and you got yourself one hell of a movie. Some movies want you to think, some are pure entertainment - V for Vendetta gives you just enough of both to have you sitting at the edge of your sofa in excitement while keeping you from sleep thinking about its message afterwards.

I never knew there was such a thing as a moviegasm, but on the rooftop scene I was crying from joy and sadness at the very same time, it was overwhelming. <br/><br/>Hugo Weaving is also great as V, this masked character couldn't be more alive, the little movements he makes with his body and head makes you kind of forget you don't see his face, and his intonation and overall the way he speaks makes you love him.<br/><br/>Also, Natalie Portman is gorgeous even with a bald head, but much more importantly, every move she takes is completely believable. The thing with her and V will stay with me for some days for sure, because I am jus that type... <br/><br/>The writing is also perfect and there is not one scene I would change.<br/><br/>Also, the lighting - when he is sitting on the bed with the old lady, he is in complete darkness and she is lit - this, and other little things like it make it visually enjoyable as well. <br/><br/>All of the movie is so damn clever, I cannot give it anything less than a 10/10."

","I became astonished, as I just watched 'V for Vendetta'. I was wondering why I haven't watched it till now. One of textbook movie on very sensitive topics of Non-Conformism, Anti-Regime, Revolution.<br/><br/>Acting: Hugo Weaving was just like a brilliant magician or musician or writer who had full command in his domain i.e. Anti- Regime, who has nor fear neither vanity. I always admired Natalie for her superb performances in Closer or Black Swan and above all this movie.<br/><br/>Story: The dialogues and script are intense & honest. It is a thriller movie, but it is slowly revealed to me that its more than that. The story is filled with current events and great quotes. Also it has a definite strong political sense, and I can relate it with current circumstances in many countries.<br/><br/>Direction: It was marvelous. Everything looks beautiful especially Fireworks, Home of V, Studio Scenes, all over dark yet compelling.<br/><br/>Verdict: Indeed It's one great addition into my ""List of Movies That I Want To Watch Before I Died"""

","The Wachowski Brothers are back at it again.  After their big hit with ""The Matrix"" in 1999, they decided to do another film, and to be honest, it won't let you down. This film is intensely thrilling from beginning to end, and really gets the adrenaline pumping. This futuristic story follows a man known by the alias 'V' (Hugo Weaving), a masked freedom fighter, who battles for justice against the government in London.  Put up against the totalitarian British government, a mild-mannered woman, Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), was rescued from an urgent situation by V. Very captivating and tremendously skilled in the arts of combat and deception, V, using unconventional and questionable methods, urges the citizens of London to rise up against the tyrannical rule of Britain's chancellor, Adam Sutler (John Hurt).  As Evey slowly uncovers the truth about V's mysterious past and that of her own, she emerges as his unlikely ally in the culmination of his plan to overthrow the British government to bring freedom and hope back to society. Hidden behind the Guy Fawkes mask, Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor. His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystopian future, and every emotion of his character is brought out with such elegance. Portman also excels as she really is the heroine of the film, and she handles the role quite well. The overlying plot to bring justice to Britain is taken aback at times by the unlikely bond between V and Evey, and the scenes between them are touching and well handled. The film's use of darkness effectively displays the dystopian state of Britain. Although a lot of scenes were shot outside, they were always dark and in tight corners to give you the feeling that you were constantly being monitored, which you were. Also, the use of camera angles help distinguish the powerful from the weak. In the beginning of the movie, the camera always angled up towards the chancellor from the point of view of the people. This exemplifies the authority the chancellor has over the citizens of Britain. As the movie progresses, the camera angle slowly rises and eventually is directly overhead all the people in the streets. V is an idea, a symbol, a metaphor that cannot be destroyed.  A man can be killed, but as an idea, he is indestructible. His message becomes more powerful as people gaze upon him, but not the man underneath the mask. One man can only try to make a difference in society, but as a united force of men and women, great change can be achieved. An exciting adventure to say the least, this film has all the works: great directing, captivating script, phenomenal acting, and is in its own way, breathtaking."

","A captivating take of the comic book with the same name, V for Vendetta is not your ordinary revenge or superhero flick. The main character of V is presented like more of a legend then a full flesh superhero bringing justice to a time where everything is thrown into strict government surveillance and totalitarianism. He is more of a whisper and beacon of hope aiming at bringing back the individual in society long overrun government agents and informants killing every thought or action not aligned with the plans and aspirations of the state. It is a gripping story about change, hope, individualism and free will that is surprisingly deep and it leaves a huge impression on every viewer."

The story of a corrupt government that runs London with some absurd laws e.g. curfews at 11, no same sex relationships e.t.c. and one of its victims taking revenge on the involved parties, shows why people should stand together and fight corruption in any situation. Of cause, we shouldn't use violence to fight it but in unity, we can do wonders. I would definitely recommend this movie for it tells on heck of a story."
"arthur_tafero","7","7","9","22 November 2018"," Entertaining Revolution - V for Vendetta
","Dwight Eisenhower warned us of the military-industrial complex, and George Orwell warned us of Big Brother, Terry Gilliam illustrated full bureaucratic control of our lives in Brazil (and later with The Zero Theorem), and V for Vendetta reminds us that every now and then, we need a revolution. Recent revolutions in the world include the American Revolution, the French Revolution, The Russian Revolution, and the Chinese Revolution. One could even say in 1989, there was an Anti-USSR Revolution. The producers and directors of this film were most likely influenced by Lech Welesa and Solidarity with its revolt against the USSR. It is ironic that countries that were created by revolutions eventually become countries that need them again.
England has not really had one of these revolutions; so the premise of the film is interesting. As a film, standing on cinematic standards alone, it is entertaining, uneven, has problems with pacing, but has strong character development, a good story, and excellent production values. The cast is excellent as well. Natalie Portman is superb, as is John Hurt. Today, we obviously have Anonymous as a new revolutionary force in the world order. How effective they are is a matter of opinion and conjecture. However, they would appear to be a healthy outgrowth of the need of countries to give themselves a good enema once in awhile. Well worth viewing."

"gluttony14","9","34","59","4 April 2006"," Voilà! A vibrant visual feast, and a veritable variant to a wonderful graphic novel
","V for Vendetta is amazing. There is no other word to describe it. It's a visual feast with a gripping plot and a message. You'll be glued to your seat all through-out the movie, and you'll come out sweating with your head filled with ideas. This is easily the best movie I have seen so far this year.<br/><br/>I had my reasons to doubt the quality of this film adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore at first. Although, I must confess, it is reading about this movie that made me interested in the graphic novel, it was simply written so brilliantly I was afraid it would be spoiled. Indeed, it wasn't an easy adaptation. The original graphic novel has very little action, and a mind-boggling amount of text, not to mention many numerous characters and subplots. There was also the matter of the Wachowski brothers. I did enjoy the first Matrix movie, but I was terribly disappointed with the sequels. To say the truth, this was a movie that was easy to screw up, and I had a feeling it would get screwed up. I was wrong, and I am oh-so-glad I was.<br/><br/>The plot was changed for the film adaptation. The year is no longer 1998. The nuclear war was replaced with a deadly virus. But the idea behind the movie remains, even if the chain of events is different. But the film also added something I felt the graphic novel was sorely in need of: more action. I enjoyed the graphic novel immensely, but I felt it would have been more interesting with more action. And the fight scenes in this film are incredible: swift, stylish, and exciting. I did not like the changed made in Lord of the Rings. But in V, I did not mind the changes. The Wachowskis created a story of their own, based on Alan Moore's original, but different. And it works.<br/><br/>There was, however, one change that was for the worst. In the graphic novel, V was insane, and there was no doubt about it. He wasn't simply weird, he was also unpredictable, mysterious and eccentric. V's character was brilliant in the graphic novel, and it was slimmed down in this movie. Hugo Weaving was great as V, of course, but by making the character of V more human, more sane, by making him romantically involved with Evey (who was also portrayed perfectly by Natalie Portman), he became less mysterious and less interesting. Not to mention, they made him more of a man with an idea, than an idea in itself. And that is a shame.<br/><br/>All in all, this a spectacular piece of cinema. It's highly recommendable for anyone who enjoyed the original graphic novel, for anyone who enjoys comic book movies, and for anyone who enjoys movies in general. But if you want a different, yet more fleshed out plot, with a more interesting protagonist, pick up the V for Vendetta graphic novel by Alan Moore. It's worth it."
"saint_barbie","1","185","374","27 March 2006"," V for Vacuous
","*** CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>Alan Moore's graphic novel V for Vendetta is an elegant, thought-provoking and complex exploration of the meaning of freedom and the politics of protest. The Wachowski Brothers and James McTeigue have somehow reduced this to a film that pretty much says 'Whoa, dude! Terrorists ROCK!!!111!'<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine how anyone who is a fan of the book could have produced this film. The novel is clever where the film is dumb, engaging where the film is boring, and subtle where the film simply blows stuff up. Where Moore's V is erudite and sophisticated, the best McTeigue's V can manage is a big speech of words mostly beginning with the letter 'V'. <br/><br/>Principally to blame for this must be the screenplay, which is full of unwieldy clunking additions which are supposed to make you think REAL HARD YOU GUYS about how this is LIKE RELLEVUNT to NOW. The screenplay takes a piece which is about Thatcherite Britain and tries to use it to bang home a message about George Bush's USA. So, instead of Moore's extreme conservative regime, we are presented with a 'British' government of the religious right, which seeks to ban homosexuality and Islam in the name of Christianity. Anyone who is actually British will find this confusing and nonsensical, as there is no popular religious right in Britain. And Americanisms like 'lever' (pronounced 'levver' rather than 'leever') and 'elevator' don't help.<br/><br/>Still, no one could really have expected the Wachowskis to produce a subtle or clever screenplay. But you might reasonably expect that this would be a super-stylish, high-action thriller. It isn't. The production design is sloppy - we're expected to believe that, thirty or forty years into the future, people are wearing exactly the same clothes and using exactly the same technology as they are now, with the sole exception of a little red bleepy machine which doesn't seem to have a function but might perhaps be a dictaphone. And, as for your high-octane thrills, well... don't get your hopes up. The action moves at around a quarter of the pace of the Matrix, and fight scenes are few and far between. In the climactic fight at the end, wherein V slays a whole troop of men, the film's signature visual effect finally kicks in: and it's... *drumroll*... knives leaving vapour trails. Wooooo. No need to bring a spare pair of pants to the cinema. Bullet time, it ain't.<br/><br/>There are many problems with this film: poor editing, appalling performances, the pointless addition of a love story. But the main crime is undoubtedly the sheer stupidity that the Wachowskis have brought to the table. Moore's novel deliberately does not end with firm conclusions, but asks you to consider relative evils: the government is obviously oppressive and fascist, but V is no less totalitarian in his own convictions. When he blows up symbols of democracy and justice like the OId Bailey, murders those who don't agree with him, or tortures Evie to 're-educate her', he becomes more and more like the government he despises. <br/><br/>In the film, this duality is forgotten, and V is presented as a straightforward hero. The conclusion, therefore, is that terrorism works, terrorism is good, and the ends always justify the means. The film of V for Vendetta misses the principal point of the novel, and ends up being offensive as well as boring and rubbish. Read the book, please, but don't waste your time watching this. And let's pray they never make Watchmen."

","V for Vendetta is an amazing film. It roars with stylish action, it soars with brilliant energies, and it's laced perfectly with an emotional element that touches your heart and soul. V for Vendetta....a film not just about rebellion, but about fear. The governments should be afraid of the people, we should not fear the government. Why? Because there's more of you then there are them! You outnumber them! All it takes is one leader. One leader, and all they need is one follower. Together, they can harness what it takes to take on Berlin, who has destroyed its own cities with corruption. It's not just about the war for freedom, it's about the war within our own bodies, the war to find who we truly are deep inside. V for Vendetta was incredibly mastered and done, an amazing masterpiece that boasts liveliness and strong colors. Backed by powerhouse performances and an outstanding soundtrack, V for Vendetta is a must see for not just the action lover in you, but for people who truly get it.

"joolsthegreat","10","20","33","18 March 2006"," Political Satire
","When I go to a movie, it's either to make fun of it or because I really have nothing else to do on Friday nights. Last night, I saw 'V For Vendetta' and I blown away. I didn't go to make fun of it of course, but I was just floored.<br/><br/>The political satire was wonderful. Using Muslims and homosexuals as scapegoats for the things wrong with society and lying about searching for weapons so as to torture citizens in unknown prisons are parallels to today's America, even though the movie took place in the future in England. :) I was amused that the USA had been through a Civil War and was now a Leper Colony. That's a WONDERFUL future for the Americans, wouldn't you say? (I'm being sarcastic of course) I didn't care for some of the slow motion knife twirling, but even that was overpowered by V actually slicing someone. The great thing about this film is that it's almost unbelievable and ridiculous to a point, but because V represents all the people (as Natalie Portman's character states in the film) you feel sucked in and you love V as a hero, you want him to represent you.<br/><br/>I also like how they did have some humor in the film. When Evey wakes up and goes into the kitchen, V is in a frilly apron making her breakfast. When he introduces himself to her in the street, his diction is made up mostly of words that have the lette v or begin with the letter v. He said it all so quickly and it was just amusing.<br/><br/>I suggest this movie for anyone who is in the mood for some Bush-bashing, impressive action sequences, and damn good music."
"moviemofo-2","7","64","122","14 February 2006"," Strong Statement, if not Execution
","I saw a preview of V for Vendetta at WonderCon 2006 in San Francisco, CA. When I found out there would be a screening at the Metreon - I was excited! See - for me V for Vendetta, the comicbook, is as important (if not more so) as Alan Moore's Watchmen and Frank Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. Each of those works deconstructed a society in desperate need of change or a savior. But where Watchmen and DKR gave more definitive and heroic resolutions, V for Vendetta allowed itself to end on a bleak and very downbeat note. It is a brilliant and subtle piece of work commenting on how anarchy and violence might be needed to bring about change.<br/><br/>I give the movie credit for trying.<br/><br/>It delves into the harshness of its iron-fisted government and the lies it is built on. It gives us Evey Hammond as someone we can relate to as she deals with the madness that is the masked and mysterious V. It gives us an authority figure in Finch, who uncovers the plot that lead to the fascist government's ascension.<br/><br/>And it gives us V - a terrorist. Bad word for anyone in this day and age, but is someone who terrorized an unjust society a bad person? Would we feel bad if someone terrorized the Nazis or Al-Qaeda? We see V's back story - would we be justified in horrific acts of death and destruction if we were treated so terribly? Its the mid-point of the movie which contains its greatest and quietest moments - where Evey Hammond frees herself of fear. Fans of the comicbook will be thrilled to see this sequence is nearly identical to the text.<br/><br/>Its the ending where the movie falters. It doesn't give any sense of just how things might change. Also, I wish more was made of how the people of England was changing in its attitude towards their government.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm being overly harsh due to my love for the book.<br/><br/>But this movie is still worth watching - especially in today's political climate. It may spark some debate and get you to think about the people that govern us - and tell us what to do."

This movie was incredible. i believed in the characters, i laughed with them i felt sorry for them, i felt their rises and falls. the story was incredible, it was churned out from the page to the screen so beautifully. and it had a message. i don't mean that sappy message you get at the end of a Disney movie. it spoke to me, i made the connections, i followed the dotted lines, and i was impressed, it showed the evils of the world and it showed that freedom is a price you must sacrifice, avenge, and possibly die for. if somethings not right you do something about it, an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth, all that good stuff. all in all v for vendetta was a movie i will not soon forget if ever i was appalled when i walked out of that theater some guy said ""that sucked"" then i realized that not everyone understood what i understood, a lot of people just saw a guy in a mask. i felt sorry for them i hope if you have not seen this film, you will. i gave this a 10 out of 10 with all my heart.

"CineCritic2517","1","165","346","24 March 2008"," Some movies are arguably overrated, but this is just pathetic...
","If this had been a children's-movie rated by children getting the 8.3 it got, I would have understood. But grown-up boys and girls surely have better things to do with their time than to overhype this celebration of averageness into the top 250 of this website.<br/><br/>The grown up boys 'n gals haven't rated a movie, they have rated subject-matter as it would appear. I guess that showing some concentration camp imagery, an evil Hitler-like character (a grumpy old man version of an Adolf anyway) and rehashing '1984' is enough these days to make something profound.<br/><br/>I mean, why else would a movie which has obvious pacing-flaws, a script so full of nonsensical alliteration that it would even make a Vogon gnaw off his own ears, anything but a lavish plot, a pedestrian view on politics and an agonizingly bad performance by one of its leads (Nat Portman (God bless her soul and looks) couldn't act her way out of a high-school drama even if she tried it without a fake foreign accent.) be regarded so highly? <br/><br/>Watching this borefest, my eyelids cramped from fighting gravity. I won't get into all the complaints I have with this talky and plodding twaddle, it has all been pointed out by other reviewers in the 'hated-it' section. These are just my two cents to warn anyone with an education about the incredibly inflated polling-numbers for this cringeworthy exercise in film-making, scripting, casting etc. It certainly isn't thé worst movie ever made, but it's average rating shouldn't be higher than a 5.5 and not a decimal more."
"Boba_Fett1138","10","32","58","4 August 2006"," More than just a movie; an iconic statement.
","Just like the main character itself, this movie is an icon, for fighting for freedom and liberty in the widest sense of the word.<br/><br/>The movie is multiple layered, filled with symbolism and deeper meanings but with one clear main message in it; People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people. It shows that if enough people are behind something, things can be achieved. Even killing and acts of terrorism can be justified. As the character V's says it; A building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it. Symbols are given power by people. A symbol, in and of itself is powerless, but with enough people behind it, blowing up a building can change the world. <br/><br/>The movie shows obvious interesting parallels to western leaders and governments but also that of the middle east and beyond. The parallels to the Hitler Nazi period were perhaps a bit too extreme and over-the-top to find it credible but in this case I can forgive the movie for that, since it still makes its point clear and works powerful as a thought provoking movie. For this movie truly is one of the most thought provoking movie of the last couple of decades. The movie forces us to use our minds constantly and makes us see how certain acts of violence can be used for the good cause and how symbolism and one act can inspire people for coming into action and to doing the right thing. Leaders shouldn't just be able to get away with everything they do.<br/><br/>Almost every aspect of the word freedom is present in the movie. Some in a symbolic way, others in a more obvious way. Such as freedom of speech and censorship in the media, freedom of religion (some people see this movie is anti-Christian, quite frankly I really don't see why) and freedom of being able to chose your own sexuality and being able to do what ever makes you feel good and happy. The movie also shows interesting parallels with recent issues and issues from the past, from all over the world, such as the earlier mentioned censorship in the media, which still is the case in certain middle eastern and communist countries, the ex scandals in churches but also the use of violence and terrorism against a governments their own citizens, to control and and form the people. It's refueling the conspiracy theories that the American government itself was behind the 9/11 attacks, to put fear into the people so the government was more able to do the things their way and gain from it, by getting the people behind them and exploiting from the people's their fear. But also less recent issues such as performing medical tests on prisoners, in order to create a super-race and more Nazi like references. In other words, more than enough interesting parallels to make you think about the world we're living in today.<br/><br/>What ""V for Vendetta"" also does well is mixing action entertainment with thought provoking, almost poetic like elements. In the essence the movie is still an action movie that is fast paced and has a fair amount of violence and fight sequences in it. The action sequences are shot spectacular and form some of the highlights of the movie. But of course ""V for Vendetta"" is far from your average 'superhero' movie, it's a too important and relevant movie for that. <br/><br/>The characters are also symbolic. Of course the character of V is the best example of this. Behind the mask there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea and ideas are bulletproof. I quote V a lot, since everything he says in this movie is true, even when your initial thought might suggest otherwise. Evey is a character who begins as a normal person but slowly starts to becoming just a fearless, determent freedom fighter as V is. Inspector Finch is a normal cop who start to discover and see through the lies that his government, for which he works, spreads and he slowly begins to see the whole picture and V's true intentions. And Chancellor Adam Sutler is symbolic for basically every dictator that ever lived and ruled.<br/><br/>The movie is a very good looking one. The cinematography by Adrian Biddle is truly spectacular and this movie was a worthy last picture for him. The special effects are also what makes this movie a really spectacular one.<br/><br/>The acting is also of a very high order. Hugo Weaving is great, even though he wears a mask during the entire movie. He acts through his mask and manages to give the character an own personality, complete with working and sensible emotions in certain sequences. Natalie Portman is also great but it sort of makes you wonder why she was cast in this, since she isn't British. Her accent just doesn't sound right but I have to admit that she never looked any better in a movie. She is absolutely beautiful. It was also great to see Stephen Rea in a big production again. John Hurt convincingly plays the villainous dictator. Is there any role that John Hurt can't handle? He is a very versatile actors that has already played a wide range of different characters. Really amazing.<br/><br/>But as a movie it is a rather flawed one to be perfectly honest. The story doesn't always flow and the character development and treatment is also lacking at times. It's obvious that James McTeigue still has a lot to learn when it comes to directing. But it however doesn't take away any of the movie its power or messages. The movie succeeds in what it tries to achieve and because of that I consider this movie as an absolute and important relevant masterpiece.<br/><br/>See this movie for its action or its messages. Either way you'll be pleased.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"pwfinch","1","126","264","2 July 2007"," An image of Britain in the near future - as envisaged by student activists
","I had no idea the Wachowski Brothers were still students. No really, I honestly didn't. I thought they were accomplished film-makers, but judging by the pretentious bombast that is here presented as something profound, I'll approach any further work of theirs with the same wariness I would work by any other bunch of opinionated undergrads.<br/><br/>We're in Britain, 20 or 30 years in the future, and the Conservative Party has returned to power, now with sufficient mandate to do what it has clearly always wanted to do, transform the country into a brutal Nazi state  even though it was a Conservative government who stood up so bravely to the real Nazis (I'm not a Conservative by any means, but you immediately understand the sort of targets this movie is taking pot-shots at, and if you prefer your cinematic entertainment not to be filled with unsubtle student politics, then you're already irritated). Anyway, a superhero thankfully arises, one of those guys of many inexplicable talents: he can breeze his way through the most advanced security systems (without ever feeling the need to show us how); he can perform all kinds of acrobatic hi-jinks and is also a master of weapons and technology (again, without telling or showing us how or why); he is hugely well financed and is always three or four steps ahead of his blundering foe. He even manages to break into the government's own television channel and broadcast a message of hope (as they so often seem able to do in these dystopian sci-fi thrillers).<br/><br/>Anyway, all this is a good thing because Britain is now an Orwellian police state full of dark alleys, creeping spotlights and crashing jackboots, where anyone and everyone is likely to get it in the neck, but the staunchly right-wing, Christian authorities mainly pick on intellectuals, homosexuals, Moslems and all the other minorities that student activists like to imagine are persecuted in the present-day West. As a result, our hero  'V'  is a guy proud to wear the moniker of 'terrorist'. He openly admits that his war against the state is born of a personal vendetta, and he'll go to any lengths to force his views on people  even imprisoning and torturing innocents in order to show them how terrible the enemy are (yet another half-baked student philosophy, where any means are justified by a righteous end). Of course V has a softer side too. Naturally he's a lover of the arts (students can never conceive of a hero who isn't at least as well-educated as they are). He fills his house with paintings and sculptures, and (completely irrelevantly to the plot) quotes the great works of literature at tedious length. He also appears to idolise 17th century 'freedom fighter' Guy Fawkes, a mask of whose face he wears 24-7.<br/><br/>And yes, you've got it. This is basically a hollow, ostentatious, politically outdated lump of pseudo-anarchist propaganda. <br/><br/>We could blame Alan Moore's original graphic novel, but hardly anyone read the graphic novel, whereas lots of people have seen and commented on the film, so it's the film we need to concentrate on. In any case, Alan Moore had the good grace to disinherit the film, so he's divested of all blame.<br/><br/>Even at a purely technical level, it's flawed. The narrative is weak and full of holes: why is a simple chief-inspector of police investigating a case that has the potential to bring down the whole of society?; why does the state bother with a police force at all when it has it's 'finger men'  all-licensed thugs whose job is simply to terrorise people and who are above the law themselves; despite there being spies and surveillance cameras everywhere, how is that free-thinkers are still allowed to provide rays of hope?  in this case it's Stephen Fry's character, a closet gay and Koran reader (!), who regularly mocks the government in his television show, yet only now seems to attract their attention. Why do the British public, who are constantly shown scoffing at government broadcasts and disbelieving everything the politicians say (got to remind the working-class that we're not having a go at them, I guess) do nothing about the terrible conditions in which they live, when the authorities' hold on power is patently so tenuous?<br/><br/>And if that isn't enough, the whole thing is massively overwritten, and overly talkie, and it uses lots of big words and Shakespearean quotes to show how clever the movie's authors are, and as you'd expect from a bunch of students, it preaches, boy how it preaches. But just in case the preaching isn't enough, there are lots of other bits and pieces thrown in to ram the message home: every symbol of evil seems to have a crucifix attached to it; Britain's clergy are shown to be child-molesting phoneys; her war-heroes are cruel sadists who would rather be concentration camp commandants.<br/><br/>The acting is risible. John Hurt does his usual shouting madman thing; Tim Piggot-Smith is his usual sneering bureaucrat; Natalie Portman  presumably because she thinks she's at last made it into a 'real' movie  screams and cries a lot; while Stephen Rea plays a cop so stricken with conscience that it's a miracle he even lasted one day in his job let alone rose to the rank of chief-inspector.<br/><br/>It certainly looks good, as befits the budget. But at the end of the day, it's all pretty empty and silly. The stuff and nonsense about November 5th, and the lauding of Guy Fawkes  who in reality was a religious zealot of the sort this film seems determined to loathe  shows how shallow and poorly researched it really is.<br/><br/>In short, and in keeping with the World War Two feel, this is a pile of corny old tripe"

","Astonishing. Easily the best film I've seen in my years. It combines create cinematography, writing, screenplay, and directing into a conglomerate of breathtaking film. This film makes you want to be involved, stand up, and see it again. Furthermore, it's a film that will stick with you.<br/><br/>If you can go into this movie with an open mind and willingness to think and not just be spoon fed a story, you will fall in love with the piece the Wachowski's have brought to you. From start to finish you are engaged in a inspiring tale that uncovers just enough for you to figure out things by yourself. There are many times you can feel your whole body receive goosebumps, and many more times you can look around and see smiles or looks of worry on peoples faces around you in the theater. <br/><br/>Do not be scared away by the mask, many people have said it's the reason they don't want to see this movie. It's not scary, it's not silly, Hugo Weaving turns the mask into a fully breathing, living character you yourself might find admiring."

","This was an excellent drama akin to the stories of Brave New World or Fahrenheit 451 in its scathing indictment of those who rule through fear and force. I enjoyed the story and the characters immensely. Though you never see Hugo Weaving's face, his dialogue is masterfully delivered, both a charm and an inspiration all at once. Natalie Portman clearly delivers one of her most stunning performances and projects convincing emotion in her demonstration of an internal struggle. The writing for this project was well done and stands out as a remarkable work of drama whose powerful statements will continue to thrill and haunt you for years. Although I know the graphic novel it is based on was written as an indictment of the Thatcher administration, it nevertheless stands as a reminder to all people of all nationalities that freedom is earned and totalitarianism is given away."

","It's difficult to see who exactly James McTeigue's 'V For Vendetta' is aimed at. Even given that Alan Moore's complex tale has been stripped to the bone (perhaps inevitably, as otherwise we'd be looking a looong film), it's far too wordy for most action-movie audiences  and, by the same reckoning, too violent for more thoughtful patrons. There are allusions to 'America's War' in the near-past, and of how religious fundamentalism and intolerance have come to shape the dystopia represented, but these connections are astonishingly heavy handed and unsubtle. This, plus the Wachowski Brothers fondness for cod-philosophising reduces Moore's incisive wit into something more blunt and unsubtle. That said, there are a few genuinely interesting comments made about the nature of terrorism which I'm surprised survived into the final script. No wonder the Daily Mail hated it.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the main character, the man known as V. In the comic book world (where masks are the norm) V's blank, unchanging gaze adds to his mystery. Here, though, his only expression is vocal, a great limitation of the talents of Hugo Weaving.<br/><br/>A Prologue  intended, quite clearly, for American consumption  explains a little of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot to destroy Parliament. To some extent I can see why this is done, as very few Yanks will have heard of Fawkes, and may wonder why our hero, V, dresses in the style of this historical character. This introduction sets the plotter up as an idealist, a crusader against injustice, which taps into part of what our hero is supposed to represent  the Freedom Fighter. It's a simplistic interpretation which does rather defeat the essential message of Moore's character and book. Fawkes wanted a new order, yes, but he fought on behalf of an authority no more democratic or tolerant than the one he sought to destroy. He also wanted vengeance on those  the Protestant King James, especially  whom he felt has persecuted his Catholic brethren. The bulk of the population considered him a terrorist  which is why his defeat is celebrated each November 5th. Moore's character is complex  recognising that Idealism, Terrorism and Vengeance are all part of the same destructive impulse. In the graphic novel V quotes, on occasion, from the Rolling Stones' 'Sympathy For The Devil', which is the best indicator of what the character represents  his own personal vendetta aside, he's an Anarchist, a catalyst for sudden and bloody change.<br/><br/>V's 'origins' are hinted at, but by depriving us of the detail of the original source material he becomes more human, more the 'wronged man'  and, again, I can see why this was done, as audiences are expected to empathise with their hero  but it does make what he is (as opposed to who he is) less frightening. And V should be frightening. Another attempt to humanise V  the hint of romantic feeling between him and Natalie Portman's Evey  completely misfires.<br/><br/>There are a few equally misjudged comic moments, the worst of which  a grimace-inducing 'Benny Hill' skit (more trademarked 'British' humour for the Yanks), but there are a few changes that actually work. Stephen Fry's Dietrich is virtually unrecognisable as the character from Moore's book, Dascombe, upon which it is based  but does, as a gay man masking a liberal outlook within a totalitarian regime, serve as a potent all-too-human counterpoint to our mask-wearing 'hero'. Portman's Evey is also a million miles removed from her source-character, but her screen persona is less successful than Fry's  a shame, as she could have probably made interesting work of that more ordinary, desperate Evey. For all the many changes I'm glad to say that the touching Valerie sub-plot survives intact.<br/><br/>Tim Piggot-Smith enjoys a fine return thuggish form, and John Hurt overacts his wrinkly little head off as the Chancellor. Steven Rea is excellent as the dogged, sad detective Finch  probably the most loyal transfer of character from page to screen.<br/><br/>Visually it has it's moments, and it is very stylish  as one would expect from the Wachowski Bros and Joel Silver - but very few of them are truly cinematic  save, perhaps, for the final Tchaikovsky accompanied scenes of Parliament, which was genuinely impressive.<br/><br/>I was prepared to hate this film with a fiery passion, but didn't. It wasn't  to use what the scriptwriters seem to think is the only British expletive  'b*ll*cks', but it has no real excuse for not being considerably better, given that so many of the plot changes were so unnecessary. It's the best adaptation, thus far, of any Alan Moore subject  though given how bad 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' and 'From Hell' were, that's not saying much. That said, it is seriously flawed, and most of those flaws arise out of a basic misunderstanding of the nature of the central character."
"atomdebris","1","110","237","18 April 2006"," Alan Moore was right to remove his name from this film.
","When I first heard that Alan Moore's V FOR VENDETTA was being adapted for the screen, I enjoyed a brief frisson... but this quickly turned to a cynical wait-and-see attitude after I read that Moore himself was asking to have his name removed from the project. Alan Moore is known to be rather rigid in his scruples, but there are those who feel that his rigidity is overblown, and that the man is some kind of bitchy primadonna.<br/><br/>Count me in, Alan. This film is a piece of garbage.<br/><br/>Sure, it *looks* good. The cinematography, costuming, makeup, sets, and all around technical merit can't be faulted much, although the film does suffer slightly from touches of a misguided Matrix-like darkness. Many of the shots in the film are startlingly like panels from Moore's original graphic novel... but looks are not everything, and sometimes they're not anything at all. Moore's V FOR VENDETTA is a piece of work with a serious, vibrant, important, and challenging message, not a wretched excuse for the usual Hollywood explosion porn that one might find in any Bruce Willis action abortion. Director James McTeigue and screenplay writers Andy and Larry Wachowski should be ashamed of the gutting they've given Moore's work. They have hijacked a truly inspiring piece of truly subversive art and cranked out a hollow, incoherent, castrated, de-fanged and de-clawed mockery of it. Their adaptation is a dark triumph of idiot form over intellectual substance, an arrogant slap in the face laden with product placement to add insult to the injury. This is carefully preripped punk rock fashion being sold in Macy's. It's Pat Boone singing a Little Richard song. This film is Velveeta being advertised as top-shelf Camembert.<br/><br/>I just don't know where to start digging into the fetid, cannibalistic co-opting that I see here. The only value this film has is as a touchstone for those of us who have read the graphic novel, and then only if we can overlook the utter debasement that has been perpetrated by McTeigue and the Wachowskis. Perhaps if we turned the sound off while watching.<br/><br/>Before seeing the film, I figured that no matter how badly they botched and bungled it, no matter how cynically they sold it out, it would still be a worthwhile thing if only V's televised speech was preserved intact. And of course, they gutted and polluted that too.<br/><br/>It could be argued that the politics of the film are nicely pointed, and pointed in the right direction: straight at the whorish corporate hearts of Bush's America and Tony Blair's England. The problem is that that point is (like the rest of the film's plot) muddied and blunted by an incoherence that makes one wonder how much of their zillion-dollar budget went up the noses of Mssrs. McTeigue and Wachowski in the form of entertaining white powdery substances. This is aside from the fact that Moore's V FOR VENDETTA was clearly, overtly, and unapologetically a manifesto of Anarchism as a polar opposite of Nationalism-cum-Fascism, while the McTeigue/Wachowski version is a thin, watered-down gruel that has rejected Anarchism as too radical, too controversial, and tossed it unceremoniously into the lime-pit in favor of an inchoate tissue of vague and fuzzy Democracy Lite... in fact, it turns our hero to the cause of exactly the sort of poorly defined emotional-response pseudo-Democracy that has been rammed down our throats by crypto-Nationalist neocon flag wavers like Bush and Blair for most of the last decade. The only relief here is that they didn't shove any pious Christian dialogue into V's mouth... I guess they felt vindicated in totally blowing off the original political message by keeping the story superficially hostile to the Christian Right (John Hurt as the leader of Britain's Fascist/Nationalist government is still clearly a jerk who doesn't believe in the separation of Church and State, the kind of pig who is busily ruining America by insisting on the legislation of Christian morality in all contradiction of the concepts of religious freedom and ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"").<br/><br/>Vendetta against those who would co-opt our nobler impulses and our rebellion in the name of corporate profits! And while we're at it, all hail Alan Moore... not so much for creating V FOR VENDETTA in the first place, but more for refusing to allow his ideals to be compromised by mere money, and for having the stones to disassociate himself utterly with this bowdlerized, bastardized, perverted, and ultimately worthless adaptation instead of taking the money and spreading his artistic legs like every whore in Hollywood who drops trou and bends over for big money business transactions. Woe unto those who actually paid to see it, and had no chance to make a similarly informed decision; for them (in an intellectual and political sense) this film is nothing more than a brutal symbolic gang-rape at the hands of counter-revolutionary corporate goons.<br/><br/>If you ever needed a justification for using BitTorrent to preview a film before coughing up your hard-earned money, this is it."

I'm going to fill it with images of death for shock factor, make knives fly in slow motion (instead of bullets like they did in the matrix) because I can't think of anything original, and make my protagonist hero/terrorist speak so ""eloquently"" so that the movie seems smart because no one can understand the alliteration blather coming from behind that mask. The one thing I was impressed by was Hugo Weaving's ability to recite his lines. Natalie Portman was garbage as always. Characters: all 1-dimensional. The action was generic and predictable. When it comes to IMDb ratings, some people jump to say that this is ""the worst movie ever"" and give it one star. That is silly as anyone with a brain can see that there is a tremendous difference between it and ""SuperBabies: Baby Geniuses"" which holds a bottom spot on this site. However, it is not even close to worthy of a top 250 berth. 6/10"

","I love a good dystopian future story and this adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel, while straying from a few of the original themes and ideas, is one of the most successfully built worlds I've seen on screen. With little to no warning we are thrust into the heart of a country gone horribly wrong and as the film progresses we begin to piece together the mystery of how it all came to pass. Heavy with intrigue and political satire, its themes of corruption and Orwellian paranoia are balanced with exciting action set pieces and beautifully choreographed melee from Hugo Weaving's V. V for Vendetta is a strikingly visual masterpiece, raising timelessly relevant morals and lessons around the nature of government and the power of words. Remember, remember the fifth of November."

","Plot Outline: In the near future a freedom fighter known only as ""V"" rebels against the now fascist government of Great Britain. <br/><br/>This visual aspect of this film is spectacular. The direction and cinematography has the right texture to each part of the story to successfully pull you into it. The dialogue can be a little ""par"" but has some power within it and has many nuggets of dry-humor. Many people probably won't find some of the jokes that funny, or even notice they are there. But those who do will be laughing.<br/><br/>The best part of the film however is the story and message it gives, which is an important one. It is a warning about giving up too many personal freedoms for sake of security, which many people in the United States are too willing to do. That people must stand up for their freedom no matter the cost or public opinion of them. In the film the fictional government and its leaders use their power and influence to control the country's citizens through fear. They also round up, torture, experiment on, and kill certain groups much like in Nazi-Germany. Muslims, homosexuals, and political activists who disagree with their policies are the majority of these. <br/><br/>""V"" rebels against this evil government he is labeled as a terrorist. Though he does do some evil himself, it is a necessary evil to wake the citizens up from their fear. So they too will be able to stand up for the freedom that they believe in.<br/><br/>There are also commentaries within the film on how the media is way for the government to spread its propaganda and continue to spread fear throughout the population. They even have one of the characters ""The Voice of London"" as an obvious representation of Bill O'Reily. Which I thought was great touch the film.<br/><br/>Note to Certain Viewers: If you are a close-minded conservative you will probably see this movie as anti-American. While it is certainly a critique of the direction America is now heading (which in itself is anti-American), it does not question the long-forgotten founding principals that America is supposed to have been built on."

","I have just seen this at a private screening and was hoping for great things. The general consensus was - How on earth did this get made??? 'V' is easily the longest 2 hours 10 minutes I've ever spent in a cinema. The whole thing is very short on action, and ridiculously long on tedium. A colleague I saw it with - an apolitical Australian - dubbed it 'The worst film I have ever seen..' He wasn't alone. <br/><br/>Where to start?<br/><br/>1/. Well, FOUR script writers. And not one of them with a decent writing credit to their name. Yes, I know there are loads of sad guys with no girlfriends out there, who think The Matrix is a work of mystical genius. It isn't. It is a film that stupid people think is clever. 'V' is the same, but without the good bits. I haven't read the comic novel on which it's based, but I understand the author has disassociated himself from it. AFter five minutes you can see why. From the off we are hit with ranting, heavy-handed, pretentious, meaningless drivel masquerading as commentary or satire, or allegory? God only knows. But given the hysteria of the writing teams' message, you wonder what sort of government such rabid parochialists would form given the chance.. What is obvious, after an interminable first third is: THE SCRIPT IS A MESS. The writers cannot tell a story and leave vast holes in the plot. My guess is they had neither the money, nor the will, to hire a decent script doctor. It would have been expensive.<br/><br/>2/. Hugo Weaving in a rubbish mask is irritating after two minutes. After two HOURS, you've lost the will to live. 'Hey Larry (and the other one). PLASTIC MASKS CAN'T ACT. They're static, and in movies, static=boring. But even his fight scenes were badly choreographed and badly directed.<br/><br/>3/. The whole film looks like it was made for TV. The first scene has a set like a 1970s Hammer horror. We in Britain were used to this sort of thing 20 years ago. Is London supposed to be desolate and oppressed as it would be under a totalitarian regime? If so, what was the production designer doing? <br/><br/>4/. What year is it set in? It's meant to be 20-30 years in the future and yet the police are still using old Dell computers, driving five year old Rovers and using current mobile phones. Details like these added to the veneer of cheapness.<br/><br/>5/. Plot. In Wachowskis' England there is one family, one grotty pub, two policeman who live in an office, five politicians and this girl - Ms Portman - whose parents have been killed by an evil totalitarian government because they protested against the war or something. But the government are bioterrorists experimenting on dissidents until one day there's a big explosion (not sure why) and then a nerve agent kills 100,000 people, (or is it 80,000, we get told both figures) which is falsely pinned on Muslim extremists and then John Hurt becomes Hitler on a chat show and we've still got an hour to go..... I MEAN IT IS SO MUCH JUVENILE RUBBISH. How old are these writers?<br/><br/>6/. Actors. Natalie Portman. Yes, she does a perfectly decent job with a script so full of holes and containing so many terrible lines you actually feel for her. Her accent was fine and I hope she got paid well for this, because she is at sea with this ludicrous script. Scarlett Johanssen and Bryce Dallas Howard - count yourselves lucky. John Hurt is great in these sorts of roles (Contact) Here he was terrible. One dimensional, shouty nonsense does not a performance make. Not in the least bit convincing, or unlikeable. The other bit part actors were pretty low rent, you don't even see them on TV in the UK. Even Stephen Rea was laughable on occasion.<br/><br/>7/. OK, what is the point? Governments are evil? Totalitarianism is a bit unpleasant? Revolution will save us all? Or worse - and I think this is what our angst-ridden writers are getting at - 9/11 was a Bush plot. How original. Simplistic, Hollywood liberalism is eating itself alive right there, up on the screen.....<br/><br/>8/. Cheap, cheap, cheap. 'V' for Vendetta cost $50m. Natalie aside, the acting is so second rate you know the budget didn't go there, the production values were sub made for TV standard, there are no Matrix sfx to speak of, so I guess the cash went on blowing up the Houses of Parliament (still not quite sure why) and shutting down St James' on a Monday night. $50m is cheap by Batman Begins standards. But it looks like it cost half that. And BB is a ten times the film this mess is. The good side? It will make money for fat Joel and his band tedious fat cats.<br/><br/>9/. Do we really need a movie for spotty, Chomsky groupies? The downside of the web has been the growth of the conspiracy theory racket. This has always been lucrative Wachowski territory and their constituency will flock to this nonsense and proclaim it a work of genius. For these people, movies like this aren't really entertainment, they are a confirmation of their own simplistic, childish beliefs in scenarios created out of low self-esteem, paranoia, social failure, limited intellect and laziness. This one's for them.<br/><br/>10/. V for Vendetta commits the greatest crime in movies. It is boring. Bad story telling is boring. Bad preaching is boring, bad acting is boring. This has all three. I was a guest at the screening I saw so I couldn't leave, and had to watch the whole thing. Someone behind me summed it up. With 30 minutes to go, they hissed 'For the love of God. End now.'"
"mightyupsetter","1","95","209","31 October 2006"," Total and utter dross
","What annoys me most about this empty, vacuous film is that it started so well, and seemed like it was going to be an intelligent comment on the war on liberty that the British government is currently engaged in. The main character is a caricature, sure, and the dystopian state an exaggeration, but there is sufficient reference to the political smoke and mirrors of today (""rendition"", ""terrorism"" and so on) to make it clear that the directors clearly think they have something worthwhile to say on the current situation. God knows, someone needs to start saying it.<br/><br/>Yet the ultimate message of the film is that violence is acceptable provided you think you're right. The hero, V, foments an anarchist revolution as vengeance for having been used in a secret biological weapons programme - he says that ""I am what they made me"" - and the opening sequence, where he takes control of a TV station and urges clichéd, typecast, idiotic proles to take the power back, certainly flatters to deceive.<br/><br/>Yet the film fails to notice that the gestures of V are as stylish, empty, and utterly image-dominated as the government that he is supposedly against. It's no use railing on, as the hero does, about how ""ideas are bullet-proof"" - this is exactly what totalitarian states rely on, the idea that their ideas are common-sense and utterly beyond debate or disagreement. What are V's ideas? It's never really clear, beyond the (again) clichéd trope that revolutionaries have the best style, the best clothes, the best pads and the best lines.<br/><br/>If the Wachowski brothers really want to rouse us from our slumbering disregard for the extent to which our lives are controlled by power, which seems to be the message of this film and the Matrix (remember the closing credits of the first Matrix film, with 'Wake Up' by Rage Against the Machine blaring forth), then what do they offer besides some vague idea that you can overthrow the powers that be using nothing more than some stylishly choreographed fight scenes and explosions, a dashing cloak, flaccid literary quotes and monstrously cool set design? That's all this film has, and while it's entertaining and fun, at its heart is not steely resolve but a pathetic emptiness, as deep as that it claims to oppose.<br/><br/>Complete crap."

","If you're a Che-Guevara-T-shirt-wearing moron, you'll love this.<br/><br/>Living in the AGE OF THE IDIOT, i.e. the AGE OF Paris HILTON, if you like, nothing surprises me anymore. It doesn't surprise me even that a comic-book (sorry, GRAPHIC NOVEL) is used to propagate deranged messages about the modern terrorist threat and the supposed ""paranoia"" that surrounds it. Not a novel, not a brilliant intellectual original screenplay  but a comic-book. It's yet more retarded stuff for the brainwashed MTV generation. Hello, 21st century! Bin Laden couldn't have wished for a better propaganda film than this. He must be sitting somewhere in one of his caves in Pakistan/Aghanistan, thinking what fools those Hollywood morons are. Why should he and his wonderful freedom-fighters (according to this movie  this is implied) even spend money and time on internet propaganda when Tinseltown is doing his dirty work for him.<br/><br/>The very idea that terrorists are noble freedom-fighters is not an old one: we know it from Marxist radicals. Nothing new there. It's also nothing new that Hollywood has been in the hands of Leftists since the first film studios were established there. Nothing new are also the dozens of left-wing propaganda dramas and thrillers that Hollywood spits out every year, tirelessly trying to convert ALL of us to THEIR idiotic, extremist way of thinking, and their dubious ""moral values"". (Hollywood, the world's center of decadence - drugs and orgies being as common as the common cold  wanting to preach ""values""; this is truly hilarious.) However, even Hollywood's cretins have ""topped"" themselves this time. This movie's message is so immoral, so cretinous, based on so many falsehoods and lies  ironical, since the movie accuses ""the other side"" (you know, Bush, Blair and other ""evil rulers"") of those same things.<br/><br/>The makers of this film are Joel Silver  a maker of retarded action movies, check out his filmography to see juts how intellectual his movies are, and the Wachowsky Brothers  known for their incredibly muddled and dumb ""Matrix"" trilogy (fine, the first movie was admittedly good). These guys were such cowards that they didn't even have the guts to set the story in New York, L.A. or somewhere else in the States. They knew that would have killed their movie. Play it safe and set it in London, hoping that most Americans will be too dumb to directly identify the anti-US stance so over-abundant in this crap-fest.<br/><br/>Style over substance, just like ""Matrix"". But I've rarely seen SUCH a discrepancy between style and substance in a movie! Terrific photography and... (well, that's about it). Weaving lends a good voice to ""V"". Natalie Portman's accent? Pretty bad. Acting? Bad, as always. Why do English actresses keep getting cast as Americans and vice versa, I'll never understand. (Are they all trying to be future Meryl Streeps, doing silly, bad accents in hopes of getting 35 Oscars? Sad.) And check out that pathetic, over-idealistic, and VERY predictable ending: masses of masked Londoners taking a stand against the ""evil"" police. I could have laughed, but by then I just wanted this crap to end so I could finally rest my brain from this movie's terrorist assault on my senses.<br/><br/>Normally I'd give even a left-wing movie a solid rating if it's done skillfully. But a movie that sides with terrorism and defends demented radicals and psychopathic terrorists as misunderstood idealists, such as ""V for V"" is, leaves such a foul taste in my mouth that there is nothing left but to consider this one as one of the worst big-budget movies ever made, if nothing than because of its vile message masked as a ""democratic"" one. Since when were Leftists ever interested in democracy? It's like MTV's ""Vote Or Die"" campaign of 2004, which meant: ""Vote for Democrats! We don't want you to vote who YOU prefer, but who WE want you to vote for! Vote for Kerry or DIE! WE decide who you should vote for and how you ought to think!"" Leftist arrogance and hypocrisy have never ceased to amaze me."

","Too often films that intend a message become mired in details, and performances suffer, becoming mannered. ""V for Vendetta"" deftly avoids these pitfalls and stands out both as a thinking film and as pure entertainment. The plot is driven by thought and action, increasing its appeal to a wide audience. Upon its release I thought ""V for Vendetta"" would be a sleeper, a cult film appealing only to those of a certain oeuvre; the huge positive response it's generated from film goers of all bents is proof of its success. I attended the theatre with my teenage children who each enjoyed it for different reasons. Viewers familiar with the graphic novel may take umbrage to deletions and changes within the story but the spirit of Alan Moore's vision is intact. <br/><br/>Few actors can carry a starring role without benefit of facial expressions but Hugo Weaving is delicious...his mellifluous voice carries just the right weight for the hefty speeches his character makes, never over the top. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman surprised me: I always considered her a lightweight actress but she gave a well measured performance, earning kudos as her character develops throughout her ordeal. <br/><br/>I've always liked John Hurt; he adds interest to any film and is perfectly cast in a mercurial role. <br/><br/>There's no doubt the years will be kind; this kind of film holds up well and is destined to become a classic."

Not only him, but also Natalie Portman, are excellent in their roles and they totally deserve an Oscar for it.<br/><br/>The movie remembered me ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' a lot, because all people were always watching TV,their Prime Minister of Britain was always talking to the people and his officials by a Big TV, very ''Big Brother'' look alike and they also have a fascist party full of members with high privileges then the others. Not to mention that it makes a critic to many things,like the power that the minority has from the majority (And that happens in most governments) the fascism, the prejudice against everybody who is different, the control that the government has from everything that happens in a country( many ways even creating lies for scare their people and give them( the government) credit), the hypocrisy of many members of the catholic church and so on.<br/><br/>The plot is : In a near-future Britain after a war, the world is a bit destroyed and an extreme fascist party called Norsefire has arisen. ""V"", an anarchist revolutionary dressed in a Guy Fawkes mask, begins an elaborated campaign to bring down the government and awake the people to protest against the way of life they are all living.

This movie was about freedom and the way that some countries might end up. People control government. Not the other way around. This movie was heavy at times but really made me think.

","I was astounded by this Movie. Really. I say that because, after Reloaded and Revolution (which disappointed me even more than I expected), I used to think the Wachowski Bros had cheated us all with the Matrix first (and only, I might add) chapter, and that the real dimension of their talent was the one we had the luck to ""appreciate"" with Assassins (which, IMHO, is going to be remembered as one of worst movies ever). So, although (or should I say ""since"") I'm a HUGE fan of Alan Moore's comic, I have to admit that I was a little skeptical. What can I say? I don't know whether I was wrong about the authors or not (who cares, anyway?), but this is a surprisingly TERRIFIC movie and I can't wait for the day the DVD shall be released in Italy! Good acting (Natalie Portman is one of the best young actresses in the biz, only Scarlett Johansson could be reasonably compared to her) and, most of all, a Great Screenplay (but maybe we should thank Alan Moore for this) make this one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, no doubt about it. Not mentioning some typically brilliant genius idea, such as John Hurt playing the right-winger chancellor (a homage to Michael Radford's ""1984"", I guess). I realized that what I was seeing was a work of art right from the beginning, but the more time passed by, the higher the pleasure. I think that one of most frequent misconception about this movie could concern the genre it belongs to. Well, in my opinion, this is not an action movie. Or better yet, this isn't JUST an action movie, and this is its strong card. X-men is an action movie. Superman returns is an action movie. V for vendetta is much more. It's not just the story of a guy with a mask who gets bored of all those Nazi bullshit and goes berserk, kicking asses and blowing up buildings. It is a wonderful representation of emotions, feelings, situations and characters in a well-balanced mix of action, dialogues and poetry and, most important thing, the plot is not so far from being a realistic picture of the world we're currently living in (at least, some part of it). This movie is a perfect mix between Orwell, Edmond Rostand's Cyrano (well, just a little bit angry) and the Matrix, played by really good actors and based on one of greatest graphic novels ever. So, whether you've read the comic or not, this masterpiece is a must-see, because there is really no reason why the 5th of November should ever be forgot."

What stays with you afterward is the intelligent ideas that are in the film ánd under the surface.<br/><br/>In a world that is more and more divided in 'good and evil', where everyone is supposed to support a 'war on terrorism', where criticism is deemed unpatriotic, this film manages to turn those ideas upside-down.<br/><br/>Terror can be of the state and what is called terrorism by officials can be exactly the opposite. The concept of freedom struggle as opposed to terrorism, the idea of 'terrorism is in the eye of the beholder' is fundamental to this film.<br/><br/>* spoiler * The final images of the film when the London Parliament is blown up draws in my view a direct parallel to the Twin Towers. Another symbolic building representing power of state is demolished by an enemy of the state, showing clearly that black and white statements often do not do justice to reality (and no I'm not saying the WTC is identical in any way). In this case the bomb clearly sets people free, it's a weapon of liberation and by using this kind of daring symbolism in their film, the Warchowsky brothers use art and movies for a serious criticism on the current state of the world where good vs evil and (fairy)tales of fiction rule politics - A great film."

How can there be something so perfect in such an imperfect world?"". The shock remains until today, because the story went on to take the edges of me, of what I am, the ideas that this film conveys, freedom, truth, revenge, things of life itself. But the times, the effects, the views, it's poesy, it is theater, spooky, shocking. Until today, this is the best movie I have ever seen.

Uh-oh.<br/><br/>V is Timothy McVeigh from the fertilizer bombs to the horrible Waco style fire flashbacks it is of all people McVeigh behind that mask. (In reality Guy Fawkes and McVeigh shared a similar philosophy. The only difference being Fawkes is famous for failing.) Now obviously the filmmakers were to busy ripping off 1984 and Phantom of the Opera to notice this. The film itself is actually quite entertaining in a mindless sort of way. The script is full of self-referential pseudo intellectual quotes and all the cute little British people say things like bullocks. (I have never actually heard an Englishman say bullocks anywhere besides an album cover. It's interesting to note that the British press hated this film with a passion unmatched by any in recent history. I guess they aren't as pro bombing of Government buildings as Americans are.)<br/><br/>The films bad guys are all evil mustache twitching, child raping psychopaths while the good guys are all innocent liberals. The idea mind you that the people will automatically rise up and support the bomber against the big bad government is a fantasy right up with we will be greeted as liberators and Jodie Foster will love me if I shoot the President. Needless to say nuance doesn't enter into the picture.<br/><br/>Which is a shame because the movie had a good chance to really make a statement had it been willing to go off the rails a little bit (pun intended) and put some shading on these characters. In all fairness to the filmmakers Timothy McVeigh was also a pretty one sided character. The only difference is where I come from he is the bad guy."

(Did I really just make a DIVING reference?) Yes, I understand that this movie used a graphic novel as a source material; this is why most comic book movies have less entertainment value than Laffy Taffy wrapper jokes.<br/><br/>The visuals and performances were top-notch, but the message delivered inside of the story was pure rubbish. It was the ""slippery slope"" rhetorical device typically used so nauseatingly by social conservatives (The whole world's gone to hell since (pick one) long hair on boys/the slam dunk/the birth control pill/rock and roll) - only this time, the slippery slope falls to the far right: If you're against gay marriage, it leads to the internment of gays. Opposition to radical Islam leads to the criminalization of the practice of Islam. Opposition to illegal immigrants leads to the deportation of all immigrants. There was also fodder for conspiracy buffs: the government knows and sees every last thing. And the government is waaaaaaaaay bad. I mean seriously - like, EVIL. There was even a Rush Limbaugh sighting, complete with prescription drug addiction! <br/><br/>It's obvious that this movie is anti-conservative, which I don't mind at all. We need honest disagreement (which we do have in this country) as long as we are willing to work together (which we have not had in this country since the 1810's).

The prescience of the author is to be commended, even though I have been told that he doesn't like how his novel was changed for the screen. I'll have to purchase it to decide for myself.<br/><br/>I normally don't go to movies with large amounts of graphic violence, but this is one which I endorse and even take my kids to see because it shows that extreme measures and intelligence can triumph over institutionalized evil, as well as that every decision (such as looking for security) has a price."

It was thrilling, taut action, snappy dialogue, and a distinct lack of plot holes. The pacing is brutal, which helps maintain the level of suspense. It would seem if you only read this part of the review that I would give V for Vendetta a 10 out of 10. But alas V for Vendetta is not perfect.<br/><br/>To be honest at times V for Vendetta is incredibly pretentious. The romance between Natalie Portman and V is contrived and is unnecessary.

Some people will think that this film urges to commit terrorism, or to dissolve governments whenever they please to. But the real thing is that the movie wants to remind us that the power of a country resides on their people. They are the ones who choose their legislating leaders, in fact, the complete government perce. V wants to teach us a lesson that consists of remembering that the ideas never die; and no matter what horrible things you had to deal to maintaining it, never die. That's the problem with governments that once they have the power in their hands, they want that we forget who chose them, just to do things their way, and thus to be able to do richer others, thanks to that business that is the government. The government or State not exist so that they can use it like an average one to make businesses, under contrary, the government exist because their job is to protect and give security to the people of their nation, besides to conserve and maintain the peace and unity. The governments have to give their people freedom in their own country and protect that freedom for that matter, as long as that freedom is subject to right laws (Locke). And also, this protection and security that the government should give to the people is not for some specific people of their nation, but to everyone no matter what color, sexual preference or religious believes. After all, for that reason it is why we pay contributions, so that the government has the resources to do it. Of not doing it, treason is considered converses from the government to its people. The government does not exist so they could create conflicts that don't exist, so they can control the people by using the fear as a tool. That is not ethical at all, is cruel, because is a way of using the people debilities to manipulate them as they were puppets.<br/><br/>We need to remember that your liberty or freedom finish when other ones starts, and is by living in justice what we could make a better world and a better government. ""REMEMBER, REMEMBER THE FITH OF November"", its mean the rebellion and what Guy Fawkes represents to the people.<br/><br/>To the people that have doubts of if they should see or not the movie, I totally recommended. The movie do not incite you to blow a building or something like that, but instead, touch a lot of themes that could make you think a lot, and at the same time is totally enjoyable because of the ironic humor that the character of V (by Hugo Weaving)has. If you think that Hugo Weaving couldn't pull this off, you are wrong, because he manage to give life a character that has not expression but a mask. V really can make you be interest in what he's saying, doing, etc... The movie over pass my expectations and I promise you that it would do the same thing on you. Att. Ivonne (Puerto Rico)"

","V for Vendetta is quite literally one of the very worst films I have ever been subjected to! It has to be in my bottom 10 movies of all time. This is not an idle statement, nor is it a rash decision biased by the fact that I have just been robbed of two hours of my life. I am not the kind of person to give a film 1 out of 10 simply because I do not like it (I gave Crash a 3), but this film should be flattered that I have given it that 1.<br/><br/>Why, you ask? In the documentary Hearts of Darkness (which is about the making of Apocalypse Now, for those who don't know), Francis Coppola says that, if you try to make a profound film and fail, you end up with the very worst kind of aesthetic crime. Case in point.<br/><br/>The story is fine as a concept, but so badly set out that it's more like a spoof than a serious socio-political message movie. The characters are all - note ALL - entirely one-dimensional caricatures. The worst of these is V, whose dialogue sounds like it was written by a GCSE drama student (high school drama student to our friends across the pond). The glib references to Shakespeare were an insult to both him and the millions of lovers of his work.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman, who cannot act her way out of a paper bag unless she is given 100% of her character in the script (as she was in Closer and Garden State - the only two movies in which she doesn't suck) suffers all the more for the fact that her English accent is awful. It's laughable to think that her character, Evie, is meant to have grown up more or less on the streets, yet she sounds like she's impersonating a BBC newscaster from the 1950s. Is this the way Americans think all Brits speak?!? Beyond this, the character was dreadfully written, leaving the audience feeling totally ambivalent toward her.<br/><br/>V was a complete waste of time too, as it is impossible to empathise with someone through a mask. Is this supposed to be an allusion to Greek theatre, or is it just an ill conceived visual choice? Did it not occur to anyone that people would switch off after a couple of minutes looking at that stupid grin?<br/><br/>The 'relationship' between Evie and V was so insultingly non-existent that they might as well have not even been in the same film. And the dialogue between them?<br/><br/>""Will you dance with me?""<br/><br/>""I remember the man...""<br/><br/>""He was my father, my mother, my brother.."" My arse!<br/><br/>PATHETIC!!!! The whole film was so utterly contrived that even its (limited) entertainment value was shat away in an orgy of unnecessary special effects and totally generic action sequences.<br/><br/>And let's talk about visual clichés; the mask siting in front of the broken mirror, the shot of Portman raising her arms to the sky in the rain, the hundreds of masked civilians gathering in Parliament Square, the pseudo film-noir lighting in the interrogation scenes... Need I go on? <br/><br/>Speaking of the prison sequences, were we really supposed to believe that a) he would have done that to her? b) she would forgive him and still fall for him? c)she'd be more concerned with her hair than with having been tortured and privated? Ludicrous! Is this what passes for character/relationship study in modern cinema?<br/><br/>P*ss poor on every conceivable level, and made infinitely worse by the fact that it takes itself so damn seriously. It fails here most of all, coming off as nothing more than utterly pretentious. Furthermore, this film does nothing but commodify the very serious issues it is supposed to be addressing.<br/><br/>There is not one redeeming thing about this over-produced mess - not one - hence Alan Moore removing his name from it.<br/><br/>I am embarrassed for everyone that likes this film."

","V for Vendetta is an adaptation of a graphic novel by Alan Moore. While V can be seen as an action film, it's much more. Although set in Britain, and originally conceived and written by a British artist, this film seems designed to speak to American political sensibilities. V probes the purpose of government and brings up themes which contemporary Americans seem to have forgotten - the basic concepts of the separation of church and state, government by and for the people, the right to overthrow leaders who exercise their own will at the expense of the nation. V reminds us of our duty to resist and rebel against megalomania and totalitarianism. Though grown in England, and tapped into English history, the message applies everywhere and to everybody, but seems especially appropriate for those of us living with the Bush administration and fearful of its legacy.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays a young woman who is afraid of her own shadow. Out after curfew one night, she is approached by a pair of ruffians and rescued by the verbose, masked V (Weaving). V is a man who has lost his identity as a result of events in his past which are mysteriously connected to the fascistic government (presided over by John Hurt). He draws his identity out of a relatively obscure event in British history, an attempt to blow up parliament, and dons a mask which is a caricature of the leader of this gunpowder revolution.<br/><br/>The plot and characterizations are complex, with adequate but not overbearing back-story. The script is occasionally goofy but excellent - retaining many elements of the comic medium without losing any credibility. The acting is simply wonderful. Natalie Portman is phenomenal. Weaving carries a difficult role very nicely, giving powerful humanity to a man who remains shrouded in mystery. Stephen Rea and John Hurt - always great - both lend strong support. The cinematography is very good and fits the story nicely.<br/><br/>Since this film involved the Wachowski's many have seen fit to compare it to the Matrix. Although there are some similarities, I think the comparison is unfair to both films. V is a much less subtle and, in a purely practical political way, a more intelligent and less playful film. It is also less cinematographically innovative and less reliant on scope. Where The Matrix unfolded in the playground of ontology, V is firmly situated in the gladiatorial arena of social psychology. Besides, V was directed by James McTeigue, not the Wachowskis.<br/><br/>Even if you don't get it from a political point of view, you are very likely to enjoy this film. I recommend it to all free-thinking individuals who have not lost hope for humanity."

As I said, I may ""like"" or ""enjoy"" other movies a fraction or two more, but ever since I have seen this film, I now consider this the ""best"" film I've ever seen. And it is definitely in the top 5 films that I ""like"" or ""enjoy"" the most. The day after I saw it I called three of my good friends to tell them how good it was, and that I'd go with them to see it again if they were going to go see it. I will buy the DVD the very first day it comes out. I'm not going to try to analyze or interpret the meaning or message here, as I feel almost anyone can benefit from seeing this movie, no matter their views or opinions, and debating the underlying meanings/messages/implications/innuendos, etc. could take me more hours than I want to spend, in addition to the responses, replies, etc. that I'd want to respond to.

","Another movie based on Alan Moore's work, another failure in every way. Written by the geeks who created (and destroyed) the matrix franchise V tries so hard to be two things at the same time: an action movie and a socio-political commentary of sorts. It mostly fails at both, but specially at the second area.<br/><br/>The premise of a single man taking over an entire government is not an easy premise to develop in a believable and convincing way. In the case of V we have a character that want's to revolt the masses to turn against the authorities. The problem with this script is that it never makes up it's mind on how it wants to present ""V"", he's a terrorist, but he's looking for revenge, he's a loony but he's sophisticated. At the end he's really just the charismatic Shepperd leading the flock. He's just another authority figure trading places with the other authority figures. He just happens to wear a very cool mask, and a suit full of knifes.<br/><br/>The movie also has no idea what to do with all it's political commentary, how to aim it properly, how to give it any weight whatsoever. England is controlled by a cartoonish religious/fascist state, complete with an evil big brother guy in a big TV always throwing orders at his inept employees. Went it comes to dealing with V this forces of the law seem to be unable of doing even the most simple and logic task. How can a man that is searched by the entire state can ship a bunch of masks to thousands of people across the country? Using every-day shipping service?<br/><br/>Once more, is not that the premise can't give us a good story, and good characters, is just that the wachachoskis have not even the slightest idea of how to handle the material. Other phony ""evil"" characters appear here and there, and at the end the entire logic of the movie is nothing more than a black and white picture where V is the good guy and the state is bad and that's it, there's your entire plot development right there. There's a very solid supporting cast doing what they can with the material. Sthepen Rea cringes at every line he spokes, Hugo Weaving at least has the mask to cover himself from the embarrassment. John Hurt hams it up, Stephen Fry brings some charm. Natalie Portman on the other hand gives yet another high-school-musical level of performance. This woman has nothing to do in front of a camera.<br/><br/>Sure, watching stuff blow up with the 1812 overture is cool to watch, but when there's nothing to back up all those images then there's a big problem with the material. The wachowskis should never, ever try to write anything else in this vein again. Think of the children please."

","V For Vendetta is a stunning adaptation of Alan Moore's science-fiction graphic novel that is faithful to its ideals, albeit with some updates which make it seem more relevant to today's world. What makes it truly unique is its believability. While the masked freedom fighter V is the stuff of comic books, the background story of the world's fall into ruin and fascism seems frighteningly possible.<br/><br/>The most powerful part of the movie occurs when Natalie Portman's Evey reads the autobiography of Valerie, a remarkable woman who was persecuted, tortured and killed because of her lesbian sexual orientation. Valerie refused to give up her integrity or her dignity, in the face of tremendous evil.<br/><br/>The graphic novel was written in the time of Thatcher and Reagan. Today, the forces of greed and ignorance are once again ascendant. Conservatives threaten our values and want to turn back the clock on all the progress made by good-hearted, progressive people. The story of V For Vendetta is a powerful reminder of what could happen if we ever let them win, if we ever give them that ""last inch."" It is also a hopeful film, however, as the forces of wisdom win in the end, just as they always have and always will. Perhaps the very fact that this great film could be made and distributed by a major studio provides the greatest hope that its events will not come to pass. Liberty prevails."
"Jacques98","1","63","136","1 October 2008"," Cute rip-off Orwell's 1984, but seriously, come on now. In the top 250 movies ever made? Excuse me as I laugh.
","I can't point to a single film by the Wachowski brothers that wasn't cheesy, over-hyped, unoriginal, and just downright pathetic. I guess the first Matrix film was alright, but that's the closest they have ever gotten to deserving even half the acclaim they get from mindless ""fine cinema""-whores. Or, in other words, ""People who do not have the ability to disagree with the critics, because they have no brain to make their own judgments."" If they critics call it original and daring, they call it original and daring, even though they've seen a hundred other movies just like it. That is the only reasonable explanation I can see for the mass love for this film.<br/><br/>Here are my ABCs of V for Vendetta: A for Annoying. The directing and camera-work are so bland and typical I felt like I was watching a children's TV show. The two main leads are okay acting, but every single secondary character, EVERY single one, are so bad at acting I occasionally had to pause the movie so I could stop and laugh. And I'm not someone who usually cares about bad actingthis was just terrible. What also annoyed me was the level of pure cheese the movie carries and sustains. Gunshots don't bleed, typical stabbings are off-screen, and even some fistfights are off screen. It just added to the children's TV show feel the directing and acting started. How did this movie get and R-rating? I've seen PG-13 movies (like Cloverfeild and The Dark Knight) that have more violence/blood than V for Vendetta. The MPAA puts this on the same level as Saw III and Hostel: Part II? Dear God, our rating system is so screwed up it's not even funny. V for Vendetta did not deserve and R-rating by any means, and I think they honestly slipped the MPAA a little cash to rate it such.<br/><br/>B for Boring. Just so anyone out there who hasn't seen this yet knows: this is not an action movie. If anything, V for Vendetta is a political drama. There are maybe two main action sequences that last about five minutes each, and the rest of the runtime is old men rambling about terrorists. The plot is no more complex than you're standard, cliché James Bond plot: terrorist appears, and old men with guns talk about him for the majority of the movie, then in the last ten minutes when the ""climax"" starts they finally stop talking about the terrorist and try to do something. In V for Vendetta, when I say the majority, probably 95%, of the movie is nothing but repeated dialogue, I mean it literally. If you were to fast-forward through all the all talking scenes, you'd still understand the plot because it's so generic. You'd also have a fifteen-minute long movie.<br/><br/>C for Cliché. As I said, the plot is a rip-off of the books that ripped-off 1984. Giant speakers, evil dictator, TVs used to make mass announcements, people have no freedom . . . blah, cliché, blah, blah. V leaves a rose after he kills, just like every cliché ""sentimental"" killer in movie history. The reason he wears a mask and why he seeks vengeance is also the biggest cliché in movie killer history. Also, the ""government lies"" jokes were so cliché and annoying I was about to turn it off. As if we haven't heard a thousand times that the government is evil! The movie doesn't even give the audience credit for having basic intelligence of political issues. I cannot name a single aspect of this movie that was original, or even close. The entire movie is the biggest cliché ever.<br/><br/>Overall, V for vendetta is a waste of time. It is just a boring drama with a cliché ""moral"" that we've heard all our lives. Sure, V himself is cool for a few minutes, but when you realize the knives he carries are just a sales gimmick because there is less action than you could see walking down the street, just know I told you so.<br/><br/>1/10"

When acting from the motive of Social Justice he kills innocent policemen who have done no one any wrong. When acting from Revenge he kills an old woman while giving her a rose and having a tender conversation with her.<br/><br/>........<br/><br/>""EVEY,"" THE OTHER MAIN Character (played very well by Natalie Portman) acts toward V with two contradictory motives, Revulsion and Love, while expecting the viewer to experience her as whole:<br/><br/>After initial anger at him for trapping her, she decides to cooperate with him. But while cooperating with him she tries to give him away to an evil priest. V then kidnaps, imprisons, and tortures her, for which she reviles him, calling him a ""monster,"" only to switch almost immediately to loving him.<br/><br/>........<br/><br/>THE MEDIA IS PORTRAYED as in the absolute control of the Government:<br/><br/>As a production of the Media, the Movie itself tells you not to trust the Media. The Movie tells you that what the Media tells you is sugar-coated lies about what are actually terrible atrocities.<br/><br/>But in real life it is the Media who tells you there are terrible atrocities going on, and that these atrocities are the Government's fault. It is the Media that criticizes the Government. One of those Media Outlets that does this is Cinema (witness George Clooney's recent movies). And this Movie belongs to said Cinema. And this Movie tells you not to trust the Media because it is controlled by Government. Confused? I know.<br/><br/>........<br/><br/>CONSERVATIVES ARE PORTRAYED AS an evil One Party Dictatorship:<br/><br/>Thus the opposite of Conservatism is what the Movie is trying to drive you to. The opposite of Conservatism is Liberalism. Liberalism as a Theory of Government is Socialism (while Conservatism is Libertarianism. Liberals are never told there may be other ways of living out their Liberal Ideals than Socialism, and Conservatives are never told there may be other ways of living out their Conservative Ideals than by hating government.). Socialism, as it has played out around the world, turns into One Party Dictatorship.<br/><br/>So the Movie tells you Conservatives are evil by showing you what evil Socialists have done in places like the USSR, China, North Korea, Cuba, etc. Imagine if the point of 1984 (a novel of warning of Socialist policies) or Animal Farm (ditto) was to beware of Mutli-Party Democracy. This is what this Movie is trying to do. Confused? I know.<br/><br/>........<br/><br/>IN LIVING THROUGH A Movie, one is meant to identify with the Main Characters, to live the Story with them. This is the fun thing about Stories:<br/><br/>But the main characters in this movie are fundamentally internally conflicted without admitting to the Viewer that they are so. Thus you are left feeling turmoil at the end of the movie without being able to identify why.<br/><br/>This is called ""disequilibrium"" and is a method used by cults to break in their new recruits. The feeling of internal split, contradiction, ""disequilibrium"" becomes so powerful that those who experience it will do anything to make it stop. (Thanks to a Psychologist acquaintance for explaining this phenomenon, used in brain-washing and cult-initiation).<br/><br/>Leaving the theatre what is most clear in the Movie-Goers' minds (though mostly their minds are confused) is that the People In Power are evil (because the way the Movie-Goer feels is terrible). And so the way to stop the terrible feeling the Movie-Goer has inside is to get rid of the current People In Power.<br/><br/>........<br/><br/>THE MOVIE TELLS YOU the way to end Dictatorship is through Anarchy:<br/><br/>But what comes of the power-vacuum which is Anarchy (the word Anarchy does not mean ""chaos"" ((no matter what my Conservative friends might tell you)) but means ""the rule of no one,"" or ""no ruler"") is a power-grab. Whoever has the most initiative grabs the most power, and a Dictatorship arises.<br/><br/>The day after this Movie ends is the day a new Dictator rises and fills the power-vacuum the destruction of the Government has left. But the Movie wants you to think the next day Democracy suddenly revives.<br/><br/>(The difference between this kind of revolution and the American Revolution is that the overthrow of the figurehead government ((England)) left the functioning governments in each State/Colony still in power. There was no power-vacuum to be seized by a dictator. In this Movie,the government is destroyed, leaving no power-structure at all. And where there is no power structure, power is seized.).<br/><br/>........<br/><br/>THE WACHOWSKI BROTHERS WANT you to vote Democrat in the upcoming elections, they're just not quite sure why. Anyone who's had to write ""thesis""/""argument"" papers for school has had similar experiences. The only thing that makes the Wachowski's different from the average student is that the Brothers W are doing things on a much larger scale."
"dioditto","1","48","101","7 December 2010"," A perverse adaptation of the original graphic novel
","In the original graphic novel, V is an uncompromising, cold blooded anarchist with a singular aim to bring down the totalitarian establishment to exact his revenge. In the film adaptation, he became a soft, crying (WTF!) ""freedom fighter"" who fights a caricature of neo-conservatist totalitarian government. There were a lot of details missing from the movie which weaken the plot, and the pacing of the movie seems chaotic and uncontrolled. <br/><br/>The acting was horrible all around, Hugo Weaving's interpretation of V was horrendous, V in the original graphic novel is a cold, calm, calculating genius mastermind, who is unemotional, and ruthless. He represents the purity of his anarchist ideology, uncompromising, like a story narrator, without any internal conflict. Hugo Weaving on the other hand, portrayed V as a soft, cry baby, with conflicting emotion, unsure about his own ideology, and unsure about his plan at times. These irrational interpretation of V's character on top of Hugo Weaving's over acting, makes this film completely unwatchable.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's portrayal of Evey was equally horrendous, She was too old for the character, and her acting was wooden and unnatural. Her character interpretation was completely one dimensional too, and completely unconvincing. (or zero dimensional if you can believe it, she does not emote!, she stares!) Her acting reminds me of her recent role in the film ""Brothers"" which was completely unwatchable by bad acting all around (especially her). I simply cannot be convince of her transformation inside V's mock prison. There is simply no substance or depth to her acting/character. It is as if in her role, she is merely an observer, not a participant of the drama. <br/><br/>Stephen Rea and John Hurt's characters are as forgettable as their acting in this movie. They were greatly under performing/underused (due to the streamlining of the plot). All I remember was John Hurt's gaping mouth when he was in shock. That's the singular moment I remember him in the movie. <br/><br/>In the end, this is a sacrilegious adaptation of a brilliant graphic novel with so much depth and substances. I only wish this movie was never made in the first place."
"SnorriGodhi","1","48","101","29 May 2006"," Style without substance
","It seems appropriate that the 1812 overture is part of the soundtrack for this movie: Tchaikovsky might dazzle for a short while, but you wouldn't want to listen to it for over two hours.<br/><br/>Even those who have not yet seen the movie, probably know that the Wachowski brothers have jumped on the anti-Bush bandwagon. The political message is not too blatant, but knowing about it helps to understand the symbolism.<br/><br/>The movie is set in a future dystopian Britain (confusingly called ""England"": perhaps Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland have become independent?). There is a second civil war in the USA, and ""England"" has fallen under a dictatorship with Christian theocratic overtones. By the look of the regime logo, the official religion seems to be Eastern Orthodoxy.<br/><br/>For some reason, the title character thinks that blowing up the Old Bailey and the Houses of Parliament would help to restore the rule of law and democracy. He styles himself after Guy Fawkes, a Catholic terrorist who tried to blow up Parliament with everybody inside.<br/><br/>Actually, the entire script appears to be written in blissful ignorance of the real world. For example, the dictatorship bans the Koran. What are the reactions of the 1.6 million Muslims in Britain? the movie does not acknowledge that they even exist. Another example: the movie opens with a British televangelist saying that America has fallen because it is more Godless than Britain.<br/><br/>The internal logic of the movie world is just as shaky. The regime is only nominally Christian, so why does it waste police resources in persecuting apolitical homosexuals? and why does it impose a late-night curfew?<br/><br/>It gets worse. One might think that an American civil war would generate enough fear to sustain a few dozen dictatorships, but the British regime fakes a few terrorist attacks for good measure. This conspiracy looks useless twice over when it transpires that people do not believe in the regime propaganda.<br/><br/>On the other hand, people immediately believe the first TV broadcast from a masked man who speaks against the government without offering any evidence whatsoever. This is what I call the ""Running Man"" plot device: an anti-government video is shown on prime time TV, and popular opinion is immediately turned around. It is becoming a popular plot device.<br/><br/>One might also wonder why V prefers knifes to guns, or how he manages to live in style in the very center of London, but this is nitpicking.<br/><br/>There is a pretense that the plot devised by V is very clever. To support this idea, we are shown how very clever he is with falling dominoes. In practice, the entire scheme devised by V can be reduced to the following:<br/><br/>BEGIN SPOILERS: The regime Security Chief has been plotting to murder the Dictator and take his place; V asks the Security Chief to carry out the execution in front of him; the Chief obliges (for reasons known only to him); finally, V kills the Security Chief. Incidentally, this is the only significant action scene, and it is poorly choreographed: the Chief's bodyguards stand like mannequins, waiting for their throats to be cut. END SPOILERS<br/><br/>This is not much of a plot, so it had to be padded with a revenge sub-plot, some prison scenes, and some explosions.<br/><br/>In summary, this movie has two confused and illogical plots (the movie plot and V's own plot) which show no knowledge of the real world; and no points of interest other than a character with a cool costume. If you want to see what life might be like under a modern theocracy, see The Handmaid's Tale: it has a low-budget look, but what do you expect in a theocracy? If you want a well-told dark story with a masked super-hero, see Batman Begins. And if you want exciting sci-fi action with a decent plot, see Terminator 2: Judgment Day."

It takes place in the mid to late 00's, the only notification on time is a paper that is written awhile ago when the government started taking over which is dated at 2015 (although the original comic took place during 1997-98). This new version of the Nazi's even have there own symbol but unlike the swastika this new symbol isn't a Hindu good luck charm it's more of a cross with an extra horizontal line. V for Vendetta is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd with the same name. The story revolves over the next rain of a fascist government, though Jews are never mentioned, they pick on Muslims and homosexuals mostly. The government is in complete control and makes sure the people keep thinking that they need them.<br/><br/>Code name ""V"" is the main character and as you may have guessed he has set out a Vendetta on the people that have ruined his life and the government who is ruining other people's life's. He's a sword wielding terrorist (a terrorist that you root for!) who dresses like Guy Fawks and quotes Shakespeare. He longs for things the government has kept from the public such as art, freedoms, music and literature. He follows Guy Fawks's plan and does all of his destruction on November the fifth. Hugho Weaving plays ""V"" and should win a golden glob or an Oscar, his performance should not be missed. Then there's Evey, played by Natalie ""Mrs.Skywalker"" Portman who's had a life full of tragedies but still follows the powers blindly. Until ""V"" influences her to rise against the oppression. Mr.Finch, played by Stephen Rea, is the police officer who tries to catch ""V"" but while trying to find him discovers some tight lidded secrets. And of course there's the leader, Adam Sutler, played by, John Hurt, and has a hair cut just like, Hitler.<br/><br/>A completely astonishing movie which teaches us about the power of one and what we can accomplish. It also teaches us to question our leaders and not to believe the media, because they are all owned by people with ties to the government and only give their point of view. Best movie I think I've ever seen, complete thumbs up, this movie covers every emotion and does it well. This is how a movie should be made and will become a classic that in 30 years people will still remember remember the fifth of November.... and this movie.

It praises one of England's biggest traitors. Guy Faukes was caught trying to blow up the parliament buildings in 1605. This is not however what bothers me most about the film. the real problem is the writing. With the exception of a few moderately neat scenes, most of the film boring, with not much plot progression, and the script includes a lot of silly and pretentious lines which sound clever but arn't.

His plan - kill some top-members of the government, get everybody to wear the same Guy Fawkes mask and blow up stuff starting with the Old Bailey - democracy and freedom will be restored. The iconoclastic scenes that feature in the film, especially the destruction of the statue of the Goddess of Justice reminded me of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas (by the Taliban in 2001). As Hindus, this glorification of iconoclasm should be doubly disturbing, in light of the thousand-year destruction of important Hindu temples, images and monuments.<br/><br/>The film displays a case of manic confusion on part of the filmmakers who show absolutely no understanding of either socio-political issues or of film-making. To begin with, the supposedly sinister and ruthless totalitarian state is reduced to a few cheesy cases of demagoguery and thug like behaviour by the authorities. Perhaps the writers need to read a bit about the erstwhile Soviet Union or even visit Bangladesh and witness the genocide of the Hindu minority to have some notion of what totalitarianism really is.<br/><br/>But the crimes of this film go far beyond moronic understanding of social and world affairs, deep into the world of film-making infringing on the very human rights of viewer to good entertainment by subjecting them to two hours of this mind numbing boredom. As far as the action goes, it seems choreographed more by somebody from Bollywood than by someone who has worked on the Matrix. Even the music, which may be good in itself, is completely unsuitable to film.<br/><br/>Overall I have been trying to scrounge at least one reason to suggest to the people to watch this film and he only one I have managed is that people should see this (maybe on a pirate DVD) to see how a film shouldn't be made. In the end I would apologise to the viewers if this review seems a little dull or lacklustre but my mind was just too rattled after seeing this film to write any better. It is just that bad. The filmmaker seem to be in dire need of the concept of Dharma in his life to stir his imaginative and creative muscles; they might just come out with something like V for Vedanta instead of this """" for an Abomination."

","If the Matrix movies made you suspect the Wachowskis are political morons, this movie makes it official: they are political morons.<br/><br/>Their ultimate symbol for popular resistance to oppression is blowing up the English parliament buildings while one of the most sympathetic characters in the movie, the naive homosexual Gordon Deitrich (played by Stephen Frye), is killed for harboring a 14th century Koran in his home.<br/><br/>""Are you Muslim?"" asks Evey (Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>""No, I'm in television."" Yuk, yuk, yuk.<br/><br/>Deitrich keeps a Koran because he is moved by its poetry. This is quite like singing ""Deutschland Uber Alles"" because you like Haydn's tune. (I wonder just how poetic a real homosexual finds the Koran's attitude towards homosexuality.)<br/><br/>So, the world is filled with fascism and oppression, most of it not in the West, and the Wachowskis' brilliant idea is to blow up the very prototype of parliamentary democracy, that one thing that virtually defines freedom. File this movie under ""C"" for Cowardice, right beside the movie of ""Sum Of All Fears"", whose real terrorists are magically converted into fake terrorists.<br/><br/>Yes, yes, I know the movie is based on a comic book (you can hardly miss that message), but the Wachowskis had a choice to make. By their choices do we know them.<br/><br/>But for the fact that nearly every word, every move, is predictable from start to finish, the movie itself is technically good.

","The mainly excellent casting and performances in this movie make up for it not quite capturing the bleak mood of Alan Moore's superb graphic novel. I feel for the makers, since they were never going to please everybody with this film (and they haven't tried to, thank God). Would have preferred to have someone unknown playing Evie, as although Natalie Portman is a good actress, I felt the part needed to be played by someone fresh and anonymous, and perhaps someone actually English to give it added authenticity That said, Portman's performance is fine and doesn't spoil the film in the way that some extremely wooden performances have ruined big films in the last few years (step forward Mr McGregor, guilty on at least two counts Â– The Island and Star Wars Episode III). Certainly much better than previous attempts at graphic novel adaptation. Let's see how Moore's magnum opus Watchmen turns out."

"Pit20","1","54","116","15 October 2006"," Very Ridiculous
","This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Maybe the worst.<br/><br/>First, the acting was horrendous. Evey (Natalie Portman) was a terrible lead character. She is never believable nor likable. Worse still than her acting is that you can never feel any sympathy for her situation. Hell, it must suck to have parents that were killed by your government, but after her trying to warn a pedophiliac bishop that a masked man was coming to kill him...I don't know, I just stopped caring about her character. Then she falls in love with this verbose villain (haha using V words really makes this dramatic!).<br/><br/>V...ah our villain/savior V. Why is it that he looks like the Last Samurai merged with the Joker? Behind that silly mask he is really a ""bulletproof idea"", this might explain how he gets shot multiple times manages to Zorro-chop the police and make it back to Evey in time for the ridiculous finale. Really, don't waste your time.<br/><br/>Wait, did anyone find these two parts funny? 1) in the opening scenes V spouts off the most ridiculous V-word strung out 8th grade prose I have ever heard. Want to hear some silly poetry? Read Shel Silverstein....this at least doesn't pretend to be for older audiences.<br/><br/>2) OK, so Evey has just spent some amount of time being tortured and brought to the supposed last moments of her life. When she finally confronts the person responsible, V, she is upset about her hair being cut off? HER HAIR (and oh yeah, and the torture too)! She was just reading stories on toilet paper ready to march off to her death...and her hair was her first concern?<br/><br/>The Benny-Hill type scene was uncomfortable to watch. I mistakenly believed this had to be the lowest point of the film. No, hold on for the domino scene. <br/><br/>Last, I will briefly comment on the plot. Is the villain really upset about the political situation or the fact that he was ""burned"" so badly? His life sucked, but to try to apply his misguided anger towards politics is weak at best. He is nothing more than a terrorist, with no plans set in place to make his world any better. Let's destroy the Parliament! Let's wreak havoc! Let's make an empty movie!<br/><br/>And the political situation is reminiscent of the Bush regime, Nazis, and guess what, any other uncomfortable situation politics might involve. This is much like V being ""my mother, my father, my brother, me."" Gag. This movie tries to hard to be deep and dramatic, and deliver a message. I think you should heed the message: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVIE!"

","The Wachowski brothers confirm their standing, commenced in 'Matrix' with 'Mr. Reagan', who 'used to be an actor' and 'would prefer not to remember anything' (remark made when Ronald Reagan was mortally ill from Altzheimer).<br/><br/>Now they have adapted a cartoon (made by people protesting this way against 'ultra-right' Thatcher government in 1980s) and cast leading left-wingers (e.g. Stephen Fry) in order to protest against Tony Blair - once a favourite of the left, who now 'betrayed' them.<br/><br/>One wonders why dictatorships shown in a contemporary movie always have to be the same: lesbians are of course persecuted, government uses the sign of cross (Lorraine, slightly similar to that used by right-wing French Gaullists) and is supported by bishops. Of course not a word of 'englightened atheism' and dumbing political correctness, so omnipotently present - not to say running rampant - in the world we REALLY live in...<br/><br/>The rest is just a consequence: unarmed hero with knives, somehow still standing after a hail of bullets; he manages to live at least for a year in a huge apartment filled with all possible kinds of art and memorabilia - not to mention training martial arts (otherwise he couldn't be possibly fit enough for all the things he does) and doing communication tricks - while he is chased by all the 'totalitarian' (i.e. supposedly very well-informed) police; childish plot to blow up the Parliament (and why??? under any dictatorship it would clearly have not had any role) and rather humorous idea with thousands of masked men (who by the way spread crime and disorder - true revolutionaries, indeed).<br/><br/>On the film's website screenwriters claim they wanted to show what happens 'when governments do not reflect the will of the people'. No matter that Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair have been elected many times by great majorities. But in fact their governments have not (or not enough) reflected views of the people like this movie's authors - tiny, unelected clique of 'artists'. And this is the real reason why this movie's been made - to deliver yet another portion of political crap.<br/><br/>If you're a far-left activist you're gonna enjoy it.

At the time I just wanted to see an exciting and action-packed movie that's not much intellectual philosophical meaning. I see that it was produced by the Wachowski's which really doesn't surprise me. Although this movie is not as groundbreaking, spectacular, or mind breaking as The Matrix it's still has an incredible mind opening message. I think this movie shows us. There really is no villain except the ones we create within our own minds. And limitations and boundaries we place on ourselves out of fear.

","V for Vendetta is very fun, upbeat, and entertaining. It's signature flaw is that it wants to be subversive, bold, and thoughtful, but it's more or less worthless on an intellectual level. Every point it makes is obvious and surprisingly averse to controversy. It contradicts itself on whether the ends should justify the means. It passes itself off as progressive by spending most of its runtime attacking right-wingers, in spite of the fact that it seems to be advocating libertarianism. It attacks cults of personality as the audience revels in V's awesomeness. I'd recommend it purely on an entertainment level, but I find it annoying when people make the film out to be meaningful."

","Perhaps the only example of a 'Bonfire Night' film I can think of, this graphic-novel adaptation casts Hugo Weaving as the vigorously verbose avant-garde anarchist known only as 'V' and places him within a bleak dystopian Britain ripe for an uprising, making a meal out of the whole 'ideas are more powerful than the men behind them' theory while also providing plenty of verbal and visual splendour in the form of a tight script and some even tighter stylish set-pieces. While 'V For Vendetta (2005)' certainly has its faults, especially in its rather slow second act - not to mention the fact that Natalie Portman's English accent is almost criminal, this is an entertaining and, at times, thought-provoking piece that manages to maintain a decent distance from its somewhat touchy subject matter and to exist purely as a piece of fairly intelligent but equally enjoyable filmmaking. 7/10"

","When the people fear their government, there is tyranny; when the government fears the people, there is liberty. Thomas Jefferson<br/><br/>That quote, modified by V in the movie, hints at my opinion of the film- (call it a simplistic one if you will). I loved this film. The Count of Monte Cristo revenge plot is given an interesting twist by the immersion in fictitious national political scene. The tyranny imposed on the citizens was inspired by both the past AND present, both fact AND fiction. The writers should not *mask* (bad pun) nor NEED to mask their political views. Everyone should be able to freely and openly state opinions and ideas! This is a key point of the film. <br/><br/>The Count of Monte Cristo revenge plot is also transformed by a romance. Evey becomes V's conscience by the end of the film, in addition to becoming his love. Both changes were enjoyable to watch. The actor who played V gave an Oscar worthy performance without having access to the main tool of an actor - facial expressions. Astoundingly well done.<br/><br/>And for those who criticize because V for Vendetta b/c they believe it to be a poor adaptation of the graphic novel I say this: No movie adaption of a book is made for the people who ""loved the book."" It's made for people who like movies! I love both so I count myself lucky. I just look at the movie as being inspired by the novel only. ...as one interpretation by a set group of people... just as Blade Runner was inspired by Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by PKD. <br/><br/>I'm not saying the movie is perfect.

","If you enjoyed Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel from 1988 -- as I did -- do yourself a favor and avoid this pale rendition. Alan Moore has disassociated himself from this film, and with good reason. A few of the character names are the same, and a couple of sequences bear a slight resemblance -- but that's it. The fire, the passion, the heart and soul that so infused the novel is completely absent. The screen story was already written, and the filmmakers ignored it, rewriting whole scenes, cutting out others, eliminating a good 75% of the story's power, meaning and resonance. The characters are shallow, empty husks of their original selves, and the pacing is abominable. Nowhere in this superficial yawnfest is the true understanding of revolution made manifest. Nowhere is the audience truly brought in to and made a part of V's tormented motivations or Evey's harrowing journey. That would require some creative camera lingering, and sets that didn't look like sound stages. If this had been made 15 years ago -- as a mini-series -- perhaps some of the gritty integrity and enduring strength of the human spirit might have been retained.<br/><br/>Shame that it ended up in the hands of overpaid incompetents."

The truth is, even the author of the original graphic novel, Alan Moore, was not willing to cooperate with the conversion of his work into a screenplay by the Wachowski brothers. The screenwriters I find far gone from professional, this movie rushed and executed terribly by James McTeigue, and an all-around terrible movie. Though I always agree with anti-war and anti-totalitarian politics, this I find an ignorant liberal stab at its own party and nothing more than a pretentious action flick.<br/><br/>Maybe I saw the wrong movie, who knows, but the glowing sign said ""V for Vendetta"". It's strange, really, whenever I tell anyone I didn't like it, they say that I didn't understand it, that I don't understand revolutions.

Suppose you gather groups of people by the millions to overtly support your enterprise, wrapped in gloss and foreshadowing. Suppose you decide to make it humorless and obvious; and to make it whole and logical not because it is those things but because your confidence makes its seem so.<br/><br/>Well, you'd have what this film has built itself against.

If you want a subversive film, go to Greenaway.<br/><br/>Yet, I can admire how this thing is put together. It is highly cinematic visually even though most of the thing is talking. But even that is tricky because the talker is behind a mask, so we largely invent the images in our own minds, prompted from time to time with inserted visions.<br/><br/>The first half is the Count of Agatha Cristie, where we are presented with an old fashioned detective story except presented from the criminal's perspective. Serial killings are ticked off and we want to know why. Though we follow the killer, our inquiries are handled by the on screen detective.<br/><br/>This is followed by an ""Oldboy"" segment, a radical shift, perhaps equally well done. And then we shift into ""Irreversible"" mode as we slide into the sappy movieland happy ending. Fireworks.<br/><br/>Along the way, we are pounded with self-reference to video media: our heroine and her pal work in TeeVee. The central Valerie character is a filmmaker who incidentally creates the film we are watching indirectly by writing it on toilet paper and passing it as if behind a mask.<br/><br/>Our hero is motivated by a certain old movie. Until the very end, we only see our political nemesis on a huge video screen, as his millions of victims do.<br/><br/>This IS worth watching, but only for the way it is constructed.

Then with the ""end justify's the means"" attitude that is so common in movies made nowadays, that a cruel world can only understand cruel answers. I personally think George Orwell's 1984 did it better using common people and real situations. I would seriously worry about a guy that has to torture and make a specially built cell for the woman he loves to be converted to his view point (this is a movie against totalitarianism but his high-handed use of the girl was a bit pot calling kettle black). Hmmm ever heard of the Stockholm syndrome where prisoners fall in love with their captors.....i'm not even gonna mention the worshipfully mask kissing scene ewwww. <br/><br/>Politically this movie is dated at best, down-right pushing the viewer to a misguided view of current British political trends, It might just be that this is 80's comic book politics pushed into current American politics, melded uncomfortably together making us squirm without realising why. Currently in the UK the politically-correct mob won years ago, religion is dying out, sexuality is anything goes from a very young age, std's on the increase and the nice movie scene where 2 parents are sat watching TV with their daughter who says bollox just wouldn't happen in todays single parent society where marriage is also dying out.

","At the risk of sounding controversial, I will honestly say that I hated this film, and I consider it shallow, annoying and presenting an oversimplified, completely false message. And the message is basically that conservatism leads to fascism. The comic book on which the film was based was supposed to be written at the time Margaret Thatcher became the prime minister in England and the conservative party won the election. The key scenes for the film's message are those that mention the chancellor as ""deeply religious member of the conservative party"", and the completely unnecessary homosexual episode, showing homosexuals as being hated and oppressed by the new government. Then there is the Finch's monologue in which he suddenly gets to see everything what is happening now as a logical chain of past events. The movie is deeply ideological and completely false in that. Not only Conservatists' did not endangered liberty, rights, etc., but the fact is that all major homicides in the history of mankind were the consequences of ideas that were on the opposite side to conservative ones. The homicides I have in mind are for example (1) the killing of people of Wandea in France at the time of French Revolution (practically a taboo subject, described in a great book by Reynald Secher), (2) the anti-religious terror in Spain in 1936, (3)-(4) Hitler's and Stalin's homicides, both were the enemies of the Church and even religion.

Accents were awful and even pronounciation was painfully American - most obvious in the word ""lever"" - a minor point, but by this point it was enough for me to wish that some effort could have been made. Clearly the amount of time i dwelled on this showed how bored i was of the same point being made over and over again.<br/><br/>In summary a good idea that was poorly executed on most levels leaving 2+hours of tired regurgitated poltical rubbish that didn't even tie in with the central story that well - Guy Fawkes was not a freedom fighter or zorro-esquire hero of the people. Basically ""Matrix reloaded"" all over again -a stupid film that thought it was a lot cleverer than it really was.<br/><br/>Rant over..."

","V for Vendetta is terrible.

To think that the Wachowski dumbed the comic book down enough for the general public, makes me fear for the future of cinema as well as that of the human race, because the number of plot themes handed to the audience was disgraceful and childish.<br/><br/>please please please avoid this movie at all costs. Anyone with half a brain will enjoy the beautifully written and illustrated comic book much more then they will the movie."
"ThomasDrufke","7","5","7","23 February 2015"," Ideas Are Bulletproof
","I have always liked the concept of an idea living on past one person or even an event. I think it's fascinating to think about how one idea can shape an entire race or population. It was tackled in The Dark Knight Trilogy as it was here in V For Vendetta. While I think this film does a brilliant job at portraying that idea, I don't think the film itself is quite as good as it's made out to be.<br/><br/>It's based on a graphic novel of the same name published by Vertigo and DC comics written by Alan Moore. I hear it's a great read so perhaps I will one day give a try, but I cant help but think that the film could have done more with it's source material. Apparently Evey's transformation into V's protégé is much more clear in the novel. I definitely found that in the film, their love seemed a bit forced. I never felt like they had this deep relationship enough to want to go through with these crimes of rebellion. V is also a character that has a fascinating back-story, but one that could have been explored even further than it was. But I do realize that revealing any sort of identity to him ruins the whole point of an idea outweighing one particular person.<br/><br/>Major props to Natalie Portman who gives a much vulnerable and daring performance. This was before Black Swan, so I think this was her first major step into dark roles as a young adult. She is terrific as Evey, a troubled and emotionally destroyed woman who soon becomes the face of a revolution. But I have to say I wish the actual revolution was shown more explicitly. We had maybe one big scene of citizens rebelling but that was it. The action looks great in the few scenes we had and it definitely seems more like the Wachowski's directed this than McTeigue. And of course the score we all know is just incredible.<br/><br/>+Without fear you are free <br/><br/>+Ideas <br/><br/>+Portman's dark performance <br/><br/>+Action<br/><br/>-Could have been even more daring <br/><br/>-Could have shown the rebellion in depth <br/><br/>-Not sure I believed their love <br/><br/>7.3/10"

The film gets diverse influences , as the myth of ¨the beauty and the beast¨ ,¨The phantom of Opera¨, the anti-Utopian literature of ¨1984 ¨ by George Orwell and , of course , ¨The Count of Montecristo¨, but we are seeing images from the classic film and ¨V¨ acts like Edmond Dantes . In fact , the screenplay of the film is remotely similar to that of the Alexandre Dumas novel 'The Count of Monte Cristo' as both stories revolve around characters who escape from imprisonment and proceed in seeking revenge on all of those responsible for their incarceration . The original comic series was originally created by Alan Moore . However, following his negative experience with ¨From Hell¨ (2001) and The league of the extraordinary men¨ (2003) , Moore decided to reject all money and credit from Hollywood on any adaptations of his work . Thus , he gave all the money he would've gotten to the artist who drew the character with him, and rejected his own ""created by"" credit from the film . The movie has a stagy and carnival stylish but with a breathtaking production design by Owen Patterson . Colorful cinematography by Adrian Biddle , he died during the filming and is dedicated to him . The motion picture was well directed by James McTeigue . James , previously , was assistant direction of Wachowski brothers (Larry and Andy) , film producers in high budget along with another great producer , Joel Silver . The flick will appeal to the comic books enthusiastic and Natalie Portman fans . Rating : Above average , well worth watching."

","What a frustrating experience this was. <br/><br/>A pseudo-historical philosophical hotchpotch slowly unfolding into a film with an alarmingly nihilistic resolution, that completely undermines the film's initial outlook. Some images are pleasing to look at, but the film's philosophy is incredibly pretentious, with some gratuitous references to Shakespeare and Goethe's Faust along the way, that have no bearing to the story at all. The main character is V, for which Hugo Weaving provided the voice, who looks like a 21th century reincarnation of The Count of Monte Christo. He is constantly - when not wreaking havoc on other people - proclaiming various philosophical cliché's, supposedly referring to totalitarianism or tyranny. Very annoying and they might as well have used a computer for his voice since his lips aren't moving.<br/><br/>The film is totally deprived of humor or even the slightest wit or irony, as one can expect from the Wachowsky brothers. For me, this overbearing seriousness is killing. Do these guys ever laugh? <br/><br/>V (for Vendetta) has rather dubious and elitist views on how to ""liberate"" the commoners from tyranny, let alone in his relations with Evey. He even tortures her in a specially built cell to force his viewpoint upon her. I thought our hero was supposed to fight these practices. He's worse than the system he's fighting against. I'd rather live under the reign of chancellor Hurt than under V's, with all his bombast and self-righteous flowery speeches about the world we live in. <br/><br/>Hardly a thoughtful film. Makes you wonder what audience the makers had in mind. As an action flick is disappointing, as drama it's hopeless. The performances don't really matter for the total lack of material to work with here, but even in this department it fails. Nathalie Portman cultivates a strange BBC-broadcasting accent and gives another bad performance. Stephen Rhea does his mumbling police inspector thing again (how often has he played these kind of roles?). He's not bad, but why is a simple police inspector put in charge of stopping a threat that could put the whole world order upside-down? What kind of character is this anyway? Stephen Fry as a TV-presenter is the only one to breath some live into his character.<br/><br/>As a political allegory, it's nothing more than postcard philosophy, completely trivial. Perhaps the Wachowsky brothers should stick to making action flicks like THE MATRIX wherein their wretched views of reality and fiction belong. With this film, they exposed themselves as two little boys with the basic understanding of a twelve-year old. Depressing. <br/><br/>Camera Obscura --- 3/10"

According to this future, the United States has been torn apart by civil war and disasters. And, the United Kingdom has gone from a constitutional monarchy to a repressive fascist dictatorship. But the government is far more evil than just repressing free speech. It seems that much of the chaos that led to this government was actually created by the man who now is in charge. To create a climate of fear and chaos, the government has created fake terrorists...and used the deaths of 10s of thousands of Brits as an excuse to control the country with an iron fist.<br/><br/>The only hope Britain has is a weird nehilistic superhero, V.

","18 March 2006. What will be interesting regarding this movie is how Hugo Weaving as V will be assessed, not Natalie Portman's performance as Evey. Hugo plays the mysterious, quite literate, masked man who emotes with a fixed smiling mask. This sharp looking action thriller with political overtones to the terrorist policies of America today even though the exclusive focus on the movie is the action occurring in Britain. V echoes back to 1984 (the movie) and even Phantom of the Opera. The introduction of a stylish mask hero and a female heroine subjected to vile torture with a twist makes for compelling film-making. Yet for all the heroics, consistent script, the exaggerated and graphic novel appeal is also its distraction. Unlike 1984, V doesn't have that believability component. Unlike Brazil, V doesn't have the complete ethereal feel. Unlike Sin City, V doesn't manage to hold true to its comic roots. Eight out of Ten Stars.<br/><br/>4/28/2016. Perhaps it is the times. Like a resurrection, V dramatically presents an eerie sense of contemporary political times. with the mutant viruses, the civil wars, terrorism, big brother surveillance, and now the fear-plagued Presidential election of the United States, V seems to resonate even more poignantly and relevantly since its initial release. This movie now brilliant shines as an emotive, political statement as well as a smoothly, entertaining statement of timeless and important ideas."

"Hancock_the_Superb","6","6","9","22 June 2008"," Reasonably entertaining film, juvenile political screed
","In the not-too-distant future, Britain is (surprise!) a dystopian, totalitarian state ruled by Fascist Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt), which exercises complete control over its citizens, ruling through fear and intimidation. Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) is a naive young Londoner who is saved from a gang of lascivious policemen by V (Hugo Weaving), a mysterious man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask. V soon initiates a campaign of terrorism against Sutler's government, hoping to spark a popular insurrection. He uses his charm and coercion to convert Evey to his cause, and soon the public begins to tire of being oppressed. Police Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea), who is assigned to track down V, begins to uncover evidence of government atrocities during the course of his investigation. It all builds up to a massive popular revolution, and Sutler's government stands on the verge of collapse.<br/><br/>""V For Vendetta"" is a film that, while reasonably entertaining on one level as an action film, is laughable in terms of its political views. It awkwardly positions itself between being a liberal position paper for standing up for freedom and civil liberties, and an endorsement of Anarchism for anarchy's sake. On a technical level, the film can't be faulted; on a thematic level, the film is laughably immature.<br/><br/>While the original graphic novel explored the complexities and ambiguities of the dichotomous political views, Anarchism and Fascism, the film takes a simplistic pro-anarchy stand. For all its posturing as a screed against totalitarian excess (with an occasionally insightful line, like V's ""People shouldn't be afraid of their government; the government should be afraid of their people""), the movie plays as an endorsement of anarchy (or perhaps Nihilism) and Revolution, with Government as something inherently evil. The film treats us to yet another dystopian future Britain, which we've seen in everything from Brave New World to 1984 to Fahrenheit 451 to Brazil to Children of Men. It's nothing we haven't seen many times before, nothing that hasn't been done much better in other films, TV series, and books. As a result, the film's political views have the grace, sophistication, and subtlety of a campus protester, or a teen-aged punk poseur. It might be valid to argue that violent revolution is the only cure for an oppressive regime; but V for Vendetta seems to think that Revolution is a good thing in and of itself. The people launch a massive uprising against the government at the end, and we're expected to cheer; but the film is curiously silent on what exactly the Revolution stands for.<br/><br/>In spite of an occasional verbose speech about lost freedoms and civil liberties, in the end, V doesn't seem to stand for much more than personal revenge (as he was victimized in a government concentration camp) and nihilism. It's hard to care much for Sutler's Big Brother state, but it's equally hard to support V when he seems to lack a goal beyond destruction of authority. The movie seems to think that Revolution for Revolution's sake is the answer, failing to pose, let alone address, the question of ""What's next?"" This is in fact the key question; 20th Century revolutions in Russia, Germany, Italy, Spain, China, Cuba, Algeria and elsewhere went sour as soon as the Revolution was won, leading to the creation of some of the most repressive regimes in the history of Mankind. Is the fact OF Revolution at the end more important than the outcome? Only a hard-core Anarchist - or, more pointedly, a teenager who thinks it's cool to pose as anti-authoritarian - would think so. Even those Revolutions who succeeded had a leader (or leaders) to guide them - with V dead, should we really expect that his uprising will have inherently positive affects? Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it, but even such a cliché insight is far beyond the childish Revolution-chic mindset of this film.<br/><br/>V's morality is made more dubious by the methods he employs. His murder of government officials is one thing; his treatment of Evey is something else entirely. He kidnaps Evey, and when his attempts at subtle and charming persuasion fail, he kidnaps her, and sends her to a faux-prison, where she's interrogated, tortured, and broken down until she becomes committed to V's cause. Just when we think we're seeing a verifiable example of Sutler's brutality, we actually see our alleged protagonist in the role of Torturer, sinking down to the level of the enemy. It would be one thing this were presented as an example of V's moral ambiguity, but since the film makes no claims that V is doing anything but good elsewhere, it serves as a rather disquieting sequence.<br/><br/>As a simple film, V for Vendetta is pretty good. The cinematography and visuals are often stunning, really capturing the feel of a bleak dystopian future state. Hugo Weaving deserves much credit for making V an intriguing character, considering we never see his face. And the movie has some interesting ideas, including the use of Stephen Rea's Police Inspector as a plot device which uncovers past government atrocities. The action scenes are entertaining and well-done, if straining credulity at times. The cast is mostly good: while Natalie Portman is merely adequate, Stephen Rey, Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Piggot-Smith, Sinead Cusack and Roger Allam give solid supporting turns.<br/><br/>So, am I being churlish for focusing on V for Vendetta's political views? Well, considering that they're positioned as the centerpiece of the film, I think it's more than fair to focus my review on them. V for Vendetta has nothing more insightful to say about politics and terrorism than a college freshman who's read a Michael Moore book. And for a film that, while somewhat entertaining, positions itself as a political statement, this is a serious flaw."

"txbangert","3","23","47","10 April 2006"," everything intelligent or coherent about the original has been either stultified or cut out leaving as a result a ridiculous and uninteresting shell
","On its own this movie is little more than a sub-standard Hollywood action movie. An action movie which doesn't deliver any credible action and a super-hero movie that doesn't deliver a credible (super)-hero (or anti-hero). Why does this super-villain mumble Shakespeare while cutting the throats of policemen (poor sods just doing their job) -- we don't know, and in the end don't really care.<br/><br/>The V figure could easily be more of a shadowy figure, of whom one could only catch brief glimpses of (as he is to a large extent) in the graphic novel). As a central figure, however, the immobile 'mask' simply does not work. Even in the graphic novel the mask is to some degree animated. If V is the central figure (and he is in practically every scene) then the 'mask' must obviously be animated -- something that has been done before in movies like The Mask(w. Jim Carrey). This is supposed to be the future & V is supposed to be some kind of genetically modified super-human -- so an animated mask would not be out of place. Even if there movie was otherwise great (which it isn't) it would be hobbled by this central immobile mask -- which works in the graphic novel, but just falls flat in a live action movie.<br/><br/>The other things that have to work in this movie are: (1) the super-villain's lair (V is a kind of super-hero after all) and (2) the backstory (the world in which V lives). The shadow gallery (the lair) is a kind of shape-changing netherworld in the graphic novel but here it is like a pokey and dusty museum -- neither cool nor interesting. More importantly, the alternate fascist near future presented is simply confusing even for an intelligent educated audience. The 'leader' shouts and rants at his top men via giant video-screen, which makes no sense at all (can't he tell the difference between a televised political speech and management of his staff). We get no idea of the political institutions like the 'Finger'. Even if you are intimately familiar with the graphic novel you will be confused by brief and unintelligible references to 'Eyes', 'Mouth' and 'Ears'. You only need look at Terry Gilliam's Brazil to see how to expertly stage the backstory. Also, most of the background is completely changed from the graphic novel. Will a kind of 'bird-flu' which kills a token 100,000 people really result in a fascist coup? Not likely! In the graphic novel most of the world is destroyed in some kind of great holocaust -- and apparently only greater London survives. There is chaos, starvation and disease. The fascists bring back order and pull civilization back from the brink. This makes sense. A bit of bird-flu is just non-sense.<br/><br/>To illustrate (hopefully in an interesting way) the backstory is of course the main function of the plot in a story such as this -- that is, the plot is more or less a vehicle for the ideas (presented via the backstory) the author hopes to present and convince the reader (ie. agitprop for the intelligentsia). Writer/director must therefore pay considerable attention to the backstory to make sure they 'get it right'. Most importantly there must be ideas & a clash of ideas there. Alan Moore presents us with a world devastated by a great holocaust of some kind and where the survivors in response create a state that is so secure and vigilant that it is able to predict (down to the second) when & where drops of rain will fall. Yet in this lazy adaptation we are apparently presented with a Britain much as it is today (that is, not really a model of efficiency), the only difference being a neo-fascist(or rather ultra-nationalist police state) type of government. People are well fed, have plenty of warm beer (which they quaff in pubs) and watch lots & lots of television (which they also seem to mostly do in pubs). Strangely this fascist gov't, aside from the occasional public service rant on the evils of islam and homosexuality, seems to content itself with providing warm beer and round the clock TV chat shows with funny Benny-Hill type skits making fun of the leader (which is actually the only genuinely good part of the film -- quite funny and well done). But no, despite much amusement in locals, the poor chat show host is arrested & dragged off (how he got this past the omni-present televised 'leader' if it was not authorized is not explained). Then somehow, unexplicably, these slothful masses revolt en-masse and march on the center of government (braveing the machine guns of the military) after V manages to broadcast some mumbled Shakespeare onto their TV screens. In the graphic novel V more or less singlehandedly causes destruction and anarchy, and thereby ending the last known civilization, which in any event had been securely but desperately holding itself from the abyss by its fingernails. V is able to do this to the super-fascist gov't because he is a genetically altered super-man. This makes some sense at least. On the other hand, why people with all the food they can eat and plenty of beer to quaff should leave their pub and march to their certain doom after receiveing a 'package' from a crazed anarcho-terrorist is not explained and makes little sense.<br/><br/>Overall, however, this is not the worst movie ever made. On its own it would be unremarkable. However, it bastardizes and subverts the original graphic novel. So much so that one has to ask: are the writers & directors banal and evil or are they simply agents of what is banal and evil within our system. Hopefully it will encourage people to buy the original graphic novel series, and lobby for a proper adaptation (a 10 part TV series would be nice, given the complexity and detail of the graphic novel) to be made so this tripe can be quietly forgotten."

","I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this film. I liked the graphic novel and was interested to see what kind of film would result from it.<br/><br/>Considering that the script for this movie was already written in comic book form by Alan Moore all those years ago I would have expected the Wachowski's to retain a lot of his work in their script as the story contains some very well-written parts. However, even parts of Alan Moore's original plot have been poorly re-written by the Wachowskis; for which there seems to be no good reason. The Wachowski's writing is very, very poor in place of it. I cite V's first speech as a striking example.<br/><br/>Secondly, Natalie Portman's poor accent skills. I read in an interview that she spent a month with a dialogue coach in order to get it right. Who've it was, she should be asking for her money back. Eventually, after swinging through Australian and South African she manages to settle into an impersonation of Keira Knightly. It really grated on my nerves.<br/><br/>I would say that this is one film to avoid if possible, unless you want to spend next bonfire night burning effigies of the Wachowski brothers."

","In a near future, a totalitarian state is ruling England. On November, 5th, a man self-calling V (Hugo Weaving) explodes a symbolic monument and starts fighting for freedom using terrorist technique. He also rescues Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from the claws of the abusive secret police and later she becomes her allied. The man in charge of the investigation, Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea), discloses the truth about his leaders while chasing V.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" is in my opinion the best action movie of the year. The story, about a totalitarian state that uses fear and terror to win the elections and dominate the population, inclusive forging terrorist attacks, is much updated. There are many excellent lines in this Orwellian story, but I would like to highlight the following ones: ""People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people""; and ""Ideas are bulletproof"". The awesome Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" fits amazingly perfect to both scenes of explosion. ""V for Vendetta"" is not only a brilliant tale of revenge as the name suggests, but mostly a magnificent message and hymn of freedom. This is a movie that deserves to be watched many times as a lesson of freedom and citizenship. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""V de Vingança"" (""V for Vendetta"")"
"The_Moose","1","27","57","19 March 2006"," P for Pathetic
","Watching ""V for Vendetta,"" the story ""The birds, the beats, and the bat"" from Aesop's fables comes to mind. That story is of a war between the birds and the beast, in which a bat attempts to ally himself with both sides, only in the end, to be friendless when peace is achieved. The moral of the story was that if you try to appease everyone, you will satisfy no one. This is the main flaw of ""V for Vendetta."" The movie often changes pace, attempting to be a action film, a serious drama, a comedy, and an ""intelligent"" commentary on the dependence on government (""science fiction,"" in the sense of remarking on societal flaws). It achieves no success in any genre. The film is too mellow and the action is too spread out to be a gripping action movie. The dialogue is too cheesy and the characters not developed properly for this movie to achieve the level of a serious and meaningful drama. Additionally, the story is executed in a manner that is too cliché and in-your-face to be an intelligent science fiction flick. The movie is funny at points, but it rarely strives to be witty enough to make you laugh for long.<br/><br/>In penning the screenplay to ""V for Vendetta,"" the Wachowski Brothers have hit a new low. They have once again proved that, like me, they have no writing skills. If you've seen their previous work - such as ""The Specialist"" or even parts two and three of the grossly overrated ""Matrix trilogy"" - then you understand what I am referring to. They take a good idea and kill it. I don't know how they do it, but they do. Despite it's promising commercial, I assure you that ""V for Vendetta"" has none of the soul or flair of the graphic novel (which I highly recommend).<br/><br/>Another thing that bugs me about this film is that it feels the need to make Matrix references, as if they were 1) still funny and 2) hilarious because the joke is being made by the writers of ""The Matrix."" Bullet time has been replaced by knife time and if you pay close enough attention to specific shots in the action sequences of this movie, you may recall them from ""The Matrix.""<br/><br/>This movie is far from an entertaining popcorn flick, with a plot that drags at numerous instances and dialogue that makes ""Matrix Revolutions"" looks like Shakespeare. If you want to see something entertaining, I implore that you to heed my warning and avoid this flick at all costs. Go to Blockbuster instead."

I tried to find some redeeming qualities for the poor actors, I like Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving, who had to spit out the worse duologue I've heard in years. The Brothers Wachowski must have still been taking their psychedelic drugs, you know the ones they were on when they made the second and third Matrix films.

The source material certainly is and, no, I don't expect movie adaptations to stick 100% to their source material (like Sin City, which, let's face it, was wooden).

","I am sure there will be a ton of people who will disagree with me on this, but I don't care I would still like to express my opinion. Well, here goes:<br/><br/>1) Dark City was fantastic and that made me think this director could pull it off since he was the assistant director on that film.<br/><br/>2) I enjoyed watching the first Matrix film. It was refreshing, I liked the action, and even though they bit off a lot of comics and the Dark City movie, it was an all around good effort.<br/><br/>3) Graphic Novels do not translate well onto film (sin city and 300 looks like the best efforts so far)<br/><br/>4) I read V for Vendetta numerous times and long before the film came out. A lot of people dismiss graphic novels for being childish and nerdy books that only teenagers read. This is a common misconception. Graphic Novels, especially Alan Moore's work, are very intelligent works of art. <br/><br/>5) Before I saw this movie I knew it was going to be ruined. Why? Because it's impossible to fit so many subplots in a movie. This isn't the part thats wrong, but it seemed like they made this movie because of whats going on in the world right now (Terrorism and War). <br/><br/>*Possible Spoilers*<br/><br/>6) The characters still seemed shallow compared to the characters in the Graphic Novel. I know its impossible to put all the subplots in this movie, but they cut out the most important ones. The whole train scene was cut out, the part where Finch goes to Larkhill and drops acid was cut out, and there was no such part when V met with Finch and Dascombe to tell them what the government was doing. They made one of the most beautiful scenes a wretched ""controversial"" part. When V comes to the doctor's house and when he tells her he ""killed"" her 5 minutes before while she was sleeping, she asks to see his face one more time before she dies and he does and she says, ""Beautiful"" right before she passes. <br/><br/>7) I'm not just nit-picking every little thing, I am a film major at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan (not intended to sound snobby), so film, or Cinematography in this case, is my passion so I studied the elements of cinema and I consider myself very knowledgeable in this medium. I was still able to look at this film as a whole (not just story wise but entertainment wise also) and I still didn't think it was a very good film. V's lines seemed to fly past and not stick with me and even the most memorable lines didn't give me goosebumps like in the Graphic Novel. <br/><br/>8) It's just tough to transform graphic novels into good films, even the works of Alan Moore. Filmmakers things that just because its so great means it will be great on film. Time and Space are so much different in graphic novels than they are in films. You take your time with graphic novels and in this film everything is sort of just thrown at you.<br/><br/>9) There is very little action in the graphic novel. If you read it again very carefully you will notice that there aren't many fighting scenes etc. Which makes me think that they were thinking about how they can make more money in ticket sales while writing the script rather than writing a more heart-felt story. <br/><br/>10) Natalie Portman is a great actress, but her beauty got in the way of her character. Someone less stunning, in my opinion should have played this role. The whole time I was staring at Natalie, but not really paying attention to what she was saying...I mean shes F*****g, man. <br/><br/>Anyway, that's all I have to say. Whoever read this whole thing, Thanks for being patient, I hope some of you will agree with what I had to say. Take care."

His vendetta is not solely against the Government but against humanity's ambivalence.<br/><br/>""V For Vendetta: the movie"" is a very one dimensional telling of a story very similar in many respects to ""V For Vendetta"".

","There are two central problems one faces when representing the realities of human life in fiction. One is that our modern world is bewilderingly complex and intricate, and the chain of cause & effect is sometimes so incredibly tangled as to all but evade comprehension and mislead even the keenest of artists & social scientists. The second problem (and this is more relevant to cinema) is that reality is too prosaic to be marketable. Its why a film like 'Seven' sells and one like 'Zodiac' doesn't.<br/><br/>The guiding principle behind this film seems to be to toss together a bunch of half-understood, superficially provocative ideas that add up to nothing, mix in some glossy production design, an overbearing editing style and a wholly contrived sequence of events that are explained by character voiceovers (we have no faith in your intelligence so we'll spell it all out for you), stir liberally, and voila! You have a ""subversive"" work of fiction, ready for mass consumption. The bright colors and slick execution delight and distract the passive viewer, and the presence of simplistic & half-baked notions fools him into thinking that he's actually watching something worthy.<br/><br/>The film is so tight and enclosed that never for a moment do you believe that the world within it exists. And its so hopelessly literal and non-cinematic that its difficult to imagine that the Wachowski brothers wrote the screenplay. Its filmed straight, with little interest in the relations between the viewer and the narrative. VFV is not as dumb or empty as Equilibrium, but I find it horrifying that anyone could compare this to 1984. The two have as much in common as a swimsuit and a bulldozer. I'm guessing that the reason why this film is so highly rated is that most viewers cant wait to congratulate themselves for having seen a ""political"" movie. Contrary to arguments voiced on IMDb and elsewhere, VFV has little to do with life on this planet. Really, how can people think so little before giving their assent to something ?? <br/><br/>The greatest scourge of modern life is not totalitarian government or even extremist religion. Its mass-marketed consumerism. There's comfort in knowing that what you like is also liked by at least a few others, and this comforting feeling, along with the equally grotesque phenomenon of shallow novelty intellectualism is what drives our current ""globalized"" world. Its what creates wealth disparities and leads to poverty, resentment and crime. It allows greedy hacks to thrive.

Its message hits you over the head like a billy club, and no surprise, the message is pure Hollywood propaganda.<br/><br/>John Hurt (the protagonist from Orwell's movie version of ""1984"", no coincidence) is the head of a police state that ruthlessly exploits public safety fears to implement totalitarian measures. We learn Hurt's character started out as a ""religious conservative"" who rose to power in the wake of public safety concerns over supposed terrorist attacks (no, I am not making this up).<br/><br/>Big brother is evidenced in force as government trucks roam through the city randomly eavesdropping on citizens' conversations (gee, no intended Bush administration parallel there).<br/><br/>Citizens are constantly assured that heightened security / diminished civil liberties are for their own protection, as they are surrounded by peril at every turn around the globe. But have no fear, ""England Prevails"" is the mantra people are taught to repeat. Gee, Bush has never said anything like that either.<br/><br/>The ""regime"" has eerie parallels to what else, Nazi Germany. We know from the beginning that people whom the state deems ""undesirable"" have been imprisoned, and the movie's own Joseph Mengela has performed unspeakable experiments on the prisoners - all for the supposed greater good of the state, of course. Homosexuals (who else?) are prime targets of the state. Soldiers/stormtroopers goose-step down a main street as their leader/Fuhrer pounds on a rostrum in the background. There is even a Swastika substitute.<br/><br/>Enemies of the state are imprisoned, re-educated, or in the case of a subversive element found with a Koran, shot dead (Nope, not making that up either).<br/><br/>So in case you didn't get it (as I will concede it is never written in boldface across the screen), the Bush Administration is exploiting your fears (and perhaps even manufacturing events to put you in fear), and is taking your beloved country down a road towards becoming a ruthless, police state where dissent equals death.<br/><br/>This movie isn't a poor man's Dr. Strangelove. This move is a 1st grade imbecil's Dr. Strangelove. This Cinematic polemic is the equivalent of a political cartoon with all the subtlety of a picture of Adolph Hitler superimposed on George Bush. The far left can, and HAS, done a HECK of a lot better than this. It is a woeful sign of the times that more than 40 years after the release of a great movie like Dr. Strangelove THIS is what ranks as compelling political cinema. Cinematic social commentary has made a sad reverse evolution - from Lincoln/Douglas 160 years ago to Sharpton/Kucinic today."

","As a comic book movie, I would have been inclined to give ""V"" an average rating but for its repellent politics. A key scene is when a gay TV host (played by Stephen Fry) comes out to heroine Evey (Natalie Portman). This scene is used to fill in the political background of the story. Apparently, all the evil that ensued in the U.K. came about through the War on Terror: ""America's War."" It is not implausible that a long-running war could lead to curtailment of civil liberties  this actually happened in the U.K. during the long battle against IRA terrorism and those freedoms have never been regained. If the movie stopped there, it would be tolerable but it doesn't.<br/><br/>As we know, ""V"" was set to come out November 2005 but the subway suicide bombings conducted by Islamic terrorists was deemed to be too much like the final scene of the movie in which the Parliament building is blown up. Now that I've seen the movie, I think there was another reason. The gay TV host has a centuries-old Koran in his secret room and talks about how lovely the writing is. Never mind that, as a gay man, in theocratic Iran (currently the number one state supporter of terrorism) he would be executed. The fact is, this scene must still be jarring for British viewers, even months after the suicide bombings and the more recent Danish cartoon demonstrations. It is so politically tin-eared and clueless as to be breathtaking.<br/><br/>The Wachowski's should have used the delay in releasing the movie to cut that scene, which has so clearly been overcome by events.

It's certainly a timely, relevant film; bringing up issues like media manipulation, censorship, national surveillance, religious hypocrisy, fear mongering, torture, prejudice, etc. But despite that, it was mostly underwhelming to say the least. The script (written by the Wachowskis) felt like it was a slightly revised first draft; the plot was convoluted and the dialogue was half-assed. Though V for Vendetta does boasts some striking visuals and imagery, the cinematography and lighting was ugly and jarringly bright, respectively.

No excessive computer effects, but nonetheless the sets and cinematography are first rate and do a great job and creating a dark world. Also there are many visual symbols as well as creative uses of words that start with 'V.' Added on top of solid acting and direction. For such a faceless performance, Hugo Weaving (who's behind a mask the whole time) plays very well at conveying the character V. However that's the movie version of V, the one in the source graphic novel is quite different.<br/><br/>The problem is the film's message and it is ridiculously shallow - ""facism is bad."" That is really it. For a such a lengthy and well produced film it is a real shame, though not much a surprise, that the attention was on the visual, but the metaphorical and philosophical are hardly attended to. There is a lot of dialog and room for for what could have been interesting thoughts of characters reflecting on their world, but it ends up being just routine. For instance when Finch is discussing with his partner the possibility of a government conspiracy they do nothing, but state the obvious - is it worth going against such a powerful government, are we afraid to, and so on. Nothing really that hasn't been done before in countless other stories.<br/><br/>Added to the fact that the film ends in an amazingly dull and ridiculously cliché big explosion. It makes sense as you watch the film, but that doesn't mean that it is interesting. How much more interesting would it be when the shadowy freedom fighter V would think of a way to topple the government by not using methods that it uses against it's own people? The film just ends up being almost a more mature version of the Star Wars story - eventually the good triumphs over the evil with a big bang.

The film-makers have denied this, and say it was delayed to allow more time for production, explaining that the visual effects would not be completed in time.<br/><br/>But as terroristic as some articles and features may accuse it to be, the main character of this movie, a masked vigilante who calls himself ""V"" really is just a rebel extremist bent on toppling the current dictatorial government that is reigning in tyrannical power over an oppressed nation. Set in a dark & grim not-so-distant-futuristic Europe, the storyline centers upon its two main characters; the vigilante V, who's scarred by a traumatic horrific past, and Evey Hammond, who's also a victim of her own traumatic past when her family all perished in political violence. When they both have become wanted by the government, the Police Inspector hunting them down uncovers dark secrets that may prove the depth of how evil and corrupt the government he works for really is.<br/><br/>This movie is based on the graphic novel from DC's Vertigo comics, written by Alan Moore and illustrated mostly by David Lloyd. The film is directed by James McTeigue, who has served as assistant director and second unit director in many big films such as the Matrix movies and Star Wars: Episode II. This movie marks his first project as the director, and indeed has done a great job, balancing the darkness of V's character with his more sympathetic side. McTeigue was also able to create a realistic totalitarian Britain, as well as the struggles, the torment, and the sense of vigilance that ignites among its citizens. This film is produced by respectable filmmakers Joel Silver, Grant Hill, and the Wachowski brothers; Larry & Andy Wachowski, who has gained mass popularity with their revolutionary Matrix movies, and has written a draft of the script in the '90s before they worked on the Matrix.<br/><br/>The central character V, draws inspiration from Guy Fawkes, a legendary Catholic revolutionary in the early 1600s who intended to blow-up the British Parliament, his conviction was to create chaos and disorder in the country from which, it was hoped, a new monarch and political regime sympathetic to the Catholic cause would emerge. But he was captured on November 5, 1605. He was tortured and publicly hanged. Evey year across England on November 5th, bonfires blaze and fireworks light the sky in celebration of the foiling of Fawkes' plot to overturn King and government. There are also elements of Victor Hugo's ""Phantom of the Opera"" in V's storyline, as his tale poses parallels with the characters of the Phantom & Christine Daae.<br/><br/>What sets this film apart from other futuristic fictions is that it is highly political and is very reflective on many of the nations and governments of our times. As do many existing governments, the government in V demands an unflinching loyalty from its citizenry, warning them not to question the government or else they will be met with the highest penalties of law. These are the governments that brand those who seek and intend to reveal the truth as seditionists, and destabilizers. These are the governments that brand activists and freedom fighters as terrorists and anarchists. These are the governments who control the media in order to restrain doubt and a sense of check & balance, and propagate their own manufactured versions of truth. This is the kind of government that drives V to struggle against. His quest for vengeance is fueled by his desire to topple the existing corrupt and totalitarian government, hoping that in its ashes will rise a government for the better future of his country.<br/><br/>V is played by Hugo Weaving, who's well-known for portraying Elrond in the Lord of the Rings movies and the cool icon villain Mr. Smith in the Matrix movies. As V, Weaving proves that he can still be an absolutely expressive actor even when he's wearing a mask. His physique, body movement, and his cool and calmly malevolent voice all add up to truly bring a charming, well-educated, and even often poetic, but lethally dangerous assassin, to life.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is not only alluring, but is also a flawless actress with focus and quite a solid performance, as a woman with her own conflicts and a convincing awakening, as she allies herself with the cause that V is fighting for. Portman struck media attention when she had her head shaved for this movie, but then again, she revealed that she has looked forward to shave her head for quite a long time. Her character represents those who have become victims of government abuse and has grown to succumb to the fear and the silence that is implemented, but later awakens to the call for struggle and rebellion.<br/><br/>Stephen Rea plays a great third-person protagonist, playing the analytical game & solving the puzzles of the past, as a chief inspector hunting down V, but unravels the dirt & evil of the government that he works for. He represents that character who, is never himself a victim of the government's abuse, but does not go against it so as to preserve a sense of orderly peace.<br/><br/>And then, there's John Hurt whose attention-shattering performance as a dictatorial chancellor of Britain is obviously patterned after Hitler.<br/><br/>This movie is truly a great political epic without resorting on unnecessary explosions, dull chase scenes and expensive stunts that other blockbuster borefests would have. Its impact is more on the storyline and the thrill. V FOR VENDETTA is, by far, the most profoundly-spectacular movie I've seen this year. Highly-dramatic despite its action genre image, and thought-provokingly reflective. V FOR VENDETTA is SUPERB!"

"procletnic","1","26","56","18 April 2006"," V is for profit machine
","First of all I want to say that I had great expectations about that movie. Probably you would ask why.. It was not the flashy trailer. It was simply the Wachowski brothers. The directors and writers of the cult movie ""The Matrix"" which is by my opinion a diamond in the Hollywood industry. ""V is for Vendetta"" was awaited by many as the next big event in the action/comics genre. Instead we got an average action movie which could only be described as ridiculous. Okay I understand that the plot is not going to be realistic as we're talking about a comics based movie here. The fact is that ""V is for Vendetta"" uses a very incompetent political model which appeals to be realistic and fairly possible.<br/><br/>If we dig up a little bit into the story of ""V is for Vendetta"" and see the main reasons why the dictator, Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), came to power we could as well laugh. The reason is a vaccine.. that doesn't sound quite reasonable does it?<br/><br/>In ""V"" we have a strange mixture of dictatorship and democracy. The majority of the people were presented as suppressed but somehow obedient. Although they knew who was responsible for their misery they didn't react which is unlikely for people who have the feeling for living in a democratic society. In the end it took a hero to show them that they must act (very original indeed!). The idea of the movie was that even one man can change the way that people think and that is nothing revolutionary.<br/><br/>I find it funny and stupid at the same time that so many people were wearing masks at the end scence. What is ""V"" a mask tycoon or something?<br/><br/>At the end of my post I want to tell you my exact point of view about this movie. The Wachowski brothers sold their names for little profit. They shot a movie which was unambitious, boring and in the end just a sub-average action movie. They wanted to save money from FX and instead fill the time up with cheesy dialogue and a lot of drama in a pathetic attempt to throw at us a stolen idea. Stick to the action genre guys! The flashy trailer was promising ... but it was all that this movie had to show to the hungry public. Where are all those movies which really deserve the grade 8.5?"
"titanrd1","10","14","27","19 March 2006"," V for Very Good!
","""Remember, remember, the fifth of November, the gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot"" These English, nursery rhyme lyrics are undoubtedly a great source of inspiration for the new film ""V for Vendetta."" Similar to the famous rhyme, ""V for Vendetta"" chronicles one man's crusade against an oppressive government.<br/><br/>The film takes place roughly two decades from present day. In this abysmal future, England has become a totalitarian state led by Adam Sutler (John Hurt) - a ruthless dictator who forces his people (by any means necessary) into submission. Our first glimpse of the film's hero, known only as the letter V, comes when he saves Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from being sexually assaulted by a pair of fascist officers. Outwardly, V (Hugo Weaving) is a combination of Zorro and the Phantom (from ""Phantom of the Opera"") with matrix-like fighting ability, but beneath the black robes and Guy Fawkes mask, he is a mystery which reveals itself throughout the course of the story. It is November fourth in a world that has forgotten November fifth, but V has planned a potent reminder. At midnight, He and Evey watch as the Old Bailey courtrooms go up in flames. The government does their best to censor this attack, calling it a planned demolition the next day, but there is only so much they can do when V takes control of a television studio and goes on the air live, challenging the public to rise up against their oppressive leadership exactly one year from this day outside the houses of Parliament. ""People should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people,"" he states.<br/><br/>Fearing for Evey's safety, V takes her back to his lair where they await the coming of November fifth. Though resistant at first, Evey quickly develops compassion for V. She even offers her assistance after a while because she too carries a vendetta: While a child, the government murdered both of her parents who were prominent, political activists. Evey is strong, but openly admits to being afraid all of the time. Over the next several months she must overcome her fears and V must continue his preparations for the rapidly approaching November fifth when he plans on finishing what Guy Fawkes started in 1605. "" Guy Fawks, Guy Fawkes, 'twas his intent to blow up the king and the Parliament.""<br/><br/>This movie is taking a lot of heat from critics who claim that it advocates terrorism. In many ways the story does revolve around two opposing terrorists. There's Sutler who exploit's the bleak condition of his country to instill fear within his people and there's V who uses violence and destruction to get his message across to the world. Seeing historical landmarks fall has become a sensitive issue these days and it occurs more than once throughout the film. However, these instances never result in the needless death of innocent civilians, but rather serve as a powerful cinematic tool. For example, the explosion of the Old Bailey courtrooms serve as a visual reference to the disintegration of that which the courtrooms once stood for, justice. It is important for people to remember that they are watching a movie. This is not a documentary, it's purpose is not to promote anything, but rather to entertain. Terrorism has always and probably will always be a real problem in the world. I see no reason why the topic should be avoided in cinema. Common sense should tell the viewer that you should not go blow something up. It is no different than watching ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and knowing not to go on a killing spree with a chainsaw.<br/><br/>Weaving and Portman excel under the direction of James McTeigue, who has been assistant director in films like ""Star Wars episode II"" and ""The Matrix"" trilogy . Hugo Weaving does more as a voice behind a mask than most actors can do free of such restrictions and Natalie Portman, in what is likely her most challenging performance to date, is fascinating. Her facial expressions alone are so powerful, she could tell the entire story without ever uttering a single word. With a screenplay based on an 80's graphic novel, the Wachowski brothers (writers of ""The Matrix"") have once again created a unique piece of work on an epic scale. This film has all the elements of a blockbuster without insulting the viewers intelligence. It raises questions about government and freedom while offering insights into human nature. ""V for vendetta"" is beautiful, gripping, thought provoking and easily the best film Hollywood has delivered to the public so far this year. 10/10 stars"
"Emperiumnostra","1","21","44","1 August 2006"," What a load of rubbish
","This film is the worst I have ever seen - I had to destroy the DVD after watching the film and that is a first (i might add that horrible movies like First knight, Troy and Titanic have survived my meat-chopper). The movie started OK, but soon it turned into a political-correct travesty. The central morale of the movie is that it's OK to use terror if it has a purpose or an idea behind it (the justification of Nazism, communism and Islam) - and once again under the banner we hate the West i.e. America. But what the director forgot was that this argument could be used to defend the regime V is fighting.<br/><br/>Please stop making movies that presuppose that the audience is unintelligent - it is offending."

","My immediate feeling after seeing this movie was of...disappointment. Set in a third-past, third-present, third-futuristic London we see the adventures of V and his female (semi-reluctant) sidekick as they attempt to blow up the houses of parliament and generally revolt against the totalitarian government which controls the land.<br/><br/>Why disappointment? The themes presented within the film, however relevant to the current political climate, are nothing new. In fact the material could be sourced from reading 1984, catch-22 and watching Gilliam's Brazil (a superior film to V for vendetta). In addition to this, the lead character is difficult to engage with, partly due to mask, partly to over-acting. Overall the rest of the casts performances are dry, and it is difficult to feel much for any of the characters they portray. The action scenes are OTT, unbelievable and unnecessary.<br/><br/>The time watching this movie could be better spent."

Directors the world over should know better than to show movie's or visuals of actors/actresses/extras watching other movies or TV!!! The last thing I want to watch is other actors and actresses watching movies/television within a movie or TV show - it's completely pretentious, flat, and decadent. It's about as much fun as looking in a mirror of yourself with another mirror behind you. This movie fails as trying to be introspective - it has a decent revenge premise, but the whole big-brother paranoid government setup reminds of bad Arnie 80's movies minus the fun of having Arnie.

","This film plays well to those of us who have already made their minds up concerning current events(that certain governments are evil). So what? Government gets away with all kinds of bad things, no matter who runs the show. <br/><br/>Aside from this, this movie reminded me a lot of ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" in its negligent desire to reach a more mature audience. I am tired of ""R"" rated films for adolescent mentalities. Young minds are easy to propagandize, especially with easily digestible, non-thinking, fiery slop. Since the story comes from a comic book, maybe it is just for the the intellectually lazy. <br/><br/>There are better films that portray similar ideas. ""Brazil"" and ""1984"" are such endeavors. They are far more frightening in their depiction of evil police states. <br/><br/>But ideas can be whispered and still change the world. ""V for Vendetta"" came close to putting me to sleep, not only because of its naive storytelling, but also because of its tired imagery. Entertainment is what it's all about, and this isn't that much fun to watch."

"polyprufrock","9","16","32","25 March 2006"," Can the revolution happen without a leader?
","Just saw it and was DEEPLY impressed. Yes, acting and cinematography were top-notch, but it was the updated socio-political commentary that gave the film its punch. The novel, written in the Thatcher/Reagan 80's, was projecting the politics of conservative corporate greed into the future, and look how far we've already come since then.... <br/><br/>Most thought-provoking was Finch's comment to his colleague upon uncovering administrative malfeasance -- if your government facilitated and/or perpetrated actions against its own people that were subsequently blamed on domestic/foreign terrorists, ""Would you want to know?"" (Such a question exposes the root of national denial, through which we're all going to hell in a hand-basket....)<br/><br/>V's liberation was by fire, and Evey's is by water. His is mythical, impossible to grasp except through enjoying the fantastical world created in graphical novels. Hers is real and intensely moving. It is the kind of freedom from fear that is faced down by untold others throughout history. Even now as I write this, and as you read it, someone somewhere is coming to terms with the ultimate value of some truth beyond one's own life. Evey experiences and surpasses that unspeakable terror which others (i.e. the great majority of us) prefer to project out into the world as ""terrorism"" -- and without facing such a fear we acquiesce to almost anything in order to believe we're ""safe."" <br/><br/>Evey's name isn't merely similar to that of V, but is a metaphor of the first woman as life-giver, and thus subject to the natural and inherent ""temptation"" of preserving life. Is there ever a war worth fighting for, dying for, killing for? This film says yes.<br/><br/>While the faceless V behind his mask is a virtual No One, he emerges as the voice of Every One -- and the movie's final moments express this beautifully. Only problem is, most folks have to be much worse off before they rise up, with or without leaders and cool costumes. Bread and circuses (i.e. ""Britain"") will indeed prevail a good while. But perhaps some day when a barely literate populace no longer has easy access to graphic novels, and global warming brings the seacoast lapping up the sides of abandoned coastal cities turned slums, the revolution will come...."

What is most pleasing about this film is how strongly it resounds with today's state of affairs.

This is so typical of liberals, not able to use facts and reason to explain there self centered social and political beliefs so instead they make some movie that twists things around. The real Nazis in this country are the liberals trying to portray Christians as hate mongers. I myself by the way not even being Christian. Furthermore, they glorify terrorism as ""heroic"". Not that guerrilla warfare isn't necessary sometimes but it sure is coincidental with all the terrorist crap going on.

The action sequences are shitty and have no real motivation. Go and buy the comic. It's probably in the top 5 list of every comic book fanatic.

"elucidations","1","9","16","18 June 2013"," The Politics of Confusion and Explosives
","I'm guilty of thinking ""V for Vendetta"" was great, awesome, and even inspirational when I first saw it. But at the same time I knew why I felt that way, I knew that it was because of how I felt about the attacks of September 11 2001. That was what moved me while watching ""V for Vendetta"", and so to some degree it was ""what I brought to the table"" (so to speak) that made me like this movie.<br/><br/>Of course the similarities between the movie and the attacks of September 11 2001, are in how those attacks took so many lives and traumatized the nation, and in how the people then rallied politically behind a certain political party or administration, and how that party or administration then rode those attacks for all their political worth, into unrivaled political power and unprecedented spending authority (which was war powers and astronomical defense budgets in the real-life case of the US).<br/><br/>But in ""V for Vendetta"" the story then had the administration that benefited from the attacks to also be the true authors of them. To paraphrase V, while he was pretending to be an inside and missing operative, and in explaining everything to the investigator, ""those in power realized it would be both easier and more beneficial, to launch a terror attack on their own people, rather than against any enemy.""<br/><br/>But for all the appeal and emotion that story had for me, I was still confused and bothered by something in the movie, which over time became greater and more pronounced.<br/><br/>After V had taken Evey to his hidden lair, and after he had given her his speech about how the government has been taken from the people, and that he (and he hopes others) are going to take it back, Evey asks him ""And so blowing up buildings, and especially blowing up Parliament, is going to do that?""<br/><br/>It is of course a perfectly good question, and the answer V gave to it was vague and obscure and in truth, abstract unsatisfying nonsense.<br/><br/>And that bothered me and stuck with me, and later in the movie it happened again, when Evey was about to pull the switch that would send the explosives-laden subway car towards it's Parliament target, but the Inspector stopped her at gunpoint, and when she said how this was in some way necessary, that it was what the people needed, the Inspector asked her how blowing up Parliament would accomplish that...<br/><br/>And Evey then gave an answer every bit as vague and obscure and unsatisfying and as nonsensically abstract, as V had given earlier.<br/><br/>It's central and key to the movie's story and message, blowing up a building, Parliament, as a political act... but why, what does it accomplish?<br/><br/>Let's wrap this up: the movie ""V for Vendetta"" is as morally ambiguous a political movie as has ever been made, and should it inspire any young and confused knuckleheads into thinking that blowing up a building is a righteous and constructive political act, then ""V for Vendetta"" is immoral, and V is certainly one of the world's most dangerous movie terrorists, with perhaps a real-life following.<br/><br/>And I find it somewhat disturbing, that in real life, the actor who played the Inspector, Stephen Rea, is the former husband of Dolours Price (exact spelling), who herself attempted to blow up the ""Old Bailey"" (the Central Criminal Court building in London), exactly as V did in the beginning of this movie.<br/><br/>I want to do more than give this movie the lowest possible rating, I want to see it charged and convicted of a crime, and sentenced to life in prison, as Stephen Rea's ex-wife Dolours Price was."

","If you cherish democracy, or if you mistakenly believe you still live in one, this film is a must-see. V for Vendetta is spot-on regarding the dark years of the United States: 2001 to 2009. Although set in England, it covers all the bases: using religion to suppress any objective thinking in the masses; widespread surveillance of individual citizens; rampant misinformation and lies from the government; faux terrorism and fear used by the government to control its own people; and the irony that the powers that be actually profit directly from the result of said terrorism (in this case, it's pharmaceutical companies profiting from bio-terror attacks, rather than oil companies benefiting from Middle East turmoil). And finally, the film reminds us that it's the duty of all us to oppose tyranny, and governments like those of George W. Bush. Bravo to the Wachowski brothers for a selflessly political film aiming to safeguard our freedom."
"vincent-27","3","15","30","21 March 2010"," Misguided interpretation of political history
","First of all this movie confirms my belief that if you make a film flashy and fast paced with quick editing then you can get away with murder. It seems this is the preferred method these days with comic adaptations, keep it fast so people don't notice the plot holes and unbelievability.<br/><br/>I guess this movie makes attempts to have a message, but I was constantly reminded of it's comic book, sorry ""graphic novel"", origins because of the existence of the ever present male pubescent fantasy super hero who can beat all the bad guys and is impervious to pain, physics etc without any real explanation as to why. V for Vendetta seems to fail on both sides, there is not nearly enough action for it to be a true comic book movie, and the political commentary is so ridiculous that it can't be taken seriously either.<br/><br/>And for those who credit it as updating the old 1984 story of big brother to the present day war on terror really don't know their political history and i think we listening to too much Air America radio when this movie was being made. 1984 was written in 1949, and was a commentary on the Soviet State, NOT a capitalist democratic state. The ones who are truly pulling the strings TODAY are the corporations, not the government. Politics is essentially a game between these two forces as how best to carve up the world's resources. The people don't really enter into it except as consumers and tax generators. Some parties are more pro corporatist than the others, but let us never forget who is really in charge. George Bush didn't wake up one day in late 2008 and decide the banks needed 750 billion dollars, it is the banks that commanded that from him. Also, everyone who makes all these Nazi Germany comparisons don't really understand what Hitler and the Nazi party represented. The Nazis were both pro government and extremely conservative, these things don't really exist today, except perhaps in China. Most conservative people are extremely anti government, especially in the United States because of all the evil the government does with taxes, like build roads and schools and stuff. Bastards! Present day neo conservatism preaches that the only role of the government is to wage wars and have a police force, each of which performs essentially the same job, protect wealth and access to resources.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the movie, even though it is shot beautifully it is really fairly empty in its heart, I never sympathized with any of the characters and every time it seemed to saying something interesting, something unbelievable would happen and all of a sudden we are back in comic book land. Everything happened so quickly that I couldn't grasp what was going on half the time, or if I did I was rolling my eyes. I also liked Natalie Portman, she at least redeemed herself from her horrible performances in the Star Wars movies (which I blame mostly on George Lucas) but I think Kira Knightly would have been better cast, at least she is British.<br/><br/>So in the end, not a bad attempt, but he rehashes the same old dead ideas about big government and anarchy and ends very similarly to Fight Club, which is not a good thing. It's message is pretty childish, when in doubt, blow everything up and it'll make everything right. Isn't that why were are in this mess in the first place?"

","Wow! As a lot of the comments I am seeing for this movie are very positive, I am just wondering if I have seen the same version, or cut, of the movie as everyone else seemingly has. I cannot see how this was enjoyed, as a whole, by anyone. Yes, there may have been certain scenes which certain people may have enjoyed but overall, there's little to be impressed with. The exploding buildings were fine but very reminiscent of Independence Day in that some of them just weren't real enough. The script was, well, poor (the alliterative sequence aside - alas, this too was overdone). The characters were bare types and I don't think anyone had to use much of their acting powers in orders to portray them. John Hurt barking out from a screen being a prime example. V's and Evey's relationship, such as it appeared to blossom from nowhere (""Oh you've tortured me and kept me as a prisoner, let me kiss you!), was unconvincing. The story didn't have much content either and the movie ran far too long. You found yourself waiting to see what the point of it all was and in the end discovered that there was little point at all. The only value that the movie has for me is that, perhaps, it is an attempt to bring to mainstream America the ideas and concepts of fear that have been used by US government to oppress the people of the US, to start and continue wars, to remove and ignore human rights, to add new ""big-brother"" style laws and to make the rich and powerful richer and yet more powerful, as Mr. Noam Chomsky's been saying for years.

In order to feel safe, what do we sacrifice? It's beautiful and poetry and stimulating and I'll watch V for Vendetta over and over."

","I was reluctant to see the film, too many release delays, and being burned on too many recent bad comic films: Punisher, Aeon Flux, UltraViolet... but I went to see this film based on overwhelmingly good comments. I must say it is perfect. The film is the best comic book film ever, perfect casting, flawless writing, superbly acted, perfectly lit and filmed, the soundtrack was genius and the direction was art. Most of all the timing of the film could not be better. It is 2015 and England is under the rule of a totalitarian dictatorship very 1984 / Brazil, it seems the eventual evolution of what the US government is becoming, our rights being freely given away in the name of security. Fear is the greatest currency of all. The film is about revolution and the power of ideals. WIth all that is going on in the US now, I am thrilled that this movie could be made, and that it was made as Oscar worthy as this one is. GO SEE IT NOW.<br/><br/>Those who would sacrifice freedom for temporary security deserve neither. - Ben Franklin"
"adidaserg","10","12","23","5 August 2006"," Why V is so good
","V for Vendetta was an original movie that has substance. The comic book that inspired this film has many deep seeded issues that I feel we all can relate too. There was so much rich dialog that made you think, and the action had you on the edge of your seat or at least mine definitely. Hugo Weaving did a great role choice to be V he also made the character believable. I loved V for Vendetta in the theaters and can not wait to own it at home. It was a well thought out film that has an edge and was very serious about what the world can become. I knew that this movie was going to be good once I found out a little bit of background about it but I had no idea it was going to be as good as it was. More movies should take the approach of V for Vendetta because it had great screen shots, once again dialog, and a unique story line. V for Vendetta is a movie you will want to watch over and over and over again. Once you see this film it will be hard to talk about anything else but V for Vendetta."
"summers-jacob","10","12","23","25 June 2006"," Wonderful!
","This is one of my favorite movies ever. The story stars with Evey, a woman who is trying to visit her boss. When she is attacked by the police, a mysterious figure, V, helps her. When he meets her, he makes a speech using much alliteration with the letter V, ending with, ""You can call me V."" I think that is a very nice touch. The movie doesn't strongly follow the comic book, but this is not a disappointment. In the comic, each victim is killed in a symbolic way, but in the movie, they all get a lethal injection from V. When V is ready to execute his plan, he takes over the TV studio, and puts a mask on every person, similar to ""Inside Man"" This movie is highly recommended."
"soporific","10","12","23","23 June 2006"," In awe of such masterly artistically political propaganda
","When The Matrix came out i was very suspicious, and having just seen V for Vendetta, now I'm sure. The Wachowski brothers may not actually be real life revolutionaries but they sure do understand them. Completely and utterly. Not since i read Jack London's ""The Iron Heel"" have i been in awe of such masterly artistic communication. Virtually everything you see on the screen is designed to heighten the impact of the plot and dialogue - the costumes, bleak weather and mood, everything - it's so interesting to watch. I remember raving about how they didn't waste a single second in any scene of the first Matrix and they've basically done it again with this film. The director could maybe have saved a further 2 to 3 minutes but that's it.<br/><br/>But it's the plot, dialogue, theme and ideas behind the movie that make it so thrilling to watch. As a revolutionary sympathiser that is. For those who think Che Guevara was a cold blooded murderer, and Fidel Castro a dictator, you're probably a bit shaken if you actually sat through the entire movie but you definitely wouldn't say it was much good. You'd probably want people to quickly move onto their next movie fix, like those guys at the end of The Truman Show who wanna know what else is on after Truman signs off for the last time.<br/><br/>For those who think the Cuban revolution is one of the most inspiring & heroic stories of all time, much better than what fiction can come up with because it is real and still undefeated (yay!), then i guarantee there's a good chance that if you go to see V for Vendetta, you're probably going to whoop and sing out ""Yay!"" like I did when something happens to a big building that represents the current political system.<br/><br/>Where the flaw of the first Matrix film was the implication that a saviour would deliver us from the system, Vendetta makes no such mistake. I thought the dominoes was a nice touch in case there were some unclear about the masses part of the answer to the social problems caused by the current system.<br/><br/>This movie will reverberate for many years to come because it manages more than any other in recent times to express the real issue of the day. And that is a tiny rich minority have vast power which is wielded through State machinery. Of the total amount of Terrorism that happens in the world, probably 99% is State Terrorism and the rest individual. The Bush gang think they can get away with the charade in Iraq, but then films like Vendetta are released into the wild and the similarities are just too many and obvious for people to not at least think about it for a bit. But the film also looks into the near future and what doing nothing will lead to. But not in any sappy, liberal way - the message is its gonna take lots of guts and courage and it will probably scare the living sh*t out of you.<br/><br/>One more thing: V for Vendetta introduces a completely new side of politics to all those without much political consciousness. If you go to see the movie, you might just come out a changed person. You might not have gone through the hell that Evey Hammond did (a very effective plot twist, my awe is squared) to experience a sufficient enough radicalisation to become a hard-core Marxist-quoting revolutionary overnight, but again, it introduces a side of politics sometimes completely alien. In any country where the people have no real interest in voting in 'democratic' elections (like Australia where I live for example), I hope they go ""oh, so that's what politics really is ..."". If that is their reaction, the Wachowski brothers would most likely see their film as a success.<br/><br/>Sirs, you have more than made up for selling out with Matrix 2 and 3. I am in awe ... 10 out of 10."

The most wonderful about this film is the fact that it presents imaginary facts with a tremendous resemblance to todays ""war on terrorism"". In the end terrorists are which ones ?

","The film ""V for Vendetta"" is based upon the same-titled comic book written referring to a real-life event: the assassination of one of the most honorable English protesters of his time Guy Fawkes, who sacrificed his life in the name of peace and human dignity. Remembering the persecution of the Church during the English assent to it's new liberalism with the manifestation of Parlement and to the excesses of Throne at the time. <br/><br/>A very political film since it demands the audience place themselves not in the Edward Gibbon (""Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"") Senatorial mindset but one of the world - and in this case the futuristic English society - drone Babbits in the guise of Natalie Portman's character.<br/><br/>In a time when political discussion is forbidden in the workplace, in religion (outside rubber stamping each and every authority), in entertainment (again outside bitchy comments on SNL or Comedy Central)it was probably too much to hope the general public would - or even could - assimilate this motion picture.<br/><br/>Each segment has a reference to today's political, economic and social hierarchy - and would in a fair world would be picked apart by high school teachers like they do other populist entertainment. <br/><br/>But it is not useful to any cause that is currently embraced by the social order so that's not likely. -- We'll have to wait until there is yet another challenge to the status quo in twenty years for the film to suddenly be discovered for use as a battering ram against ""convention"" as was done in 1960s with ""King of Hearts"" and later with ""One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest"".<br/><br/>But I'm patient - in time it will be enthroned as a poster child for another generation that it missed in ours."
"Chris_Docker","6","12","23","14 March 2006"," Matrix-lite semiotics in a confused, if mildly entertaining, grab-bag of popular elements
","V for Vendetta throws together a remarkable melange of elements, bringing them together in an attempt to be overtly political. We have a dystopian future, an England ruled by a Hitler-lite version of the worst of Blair and Thatcher's governments (multiplied to a horrifying degree); a slightly crazy Guy Fawkes -style figure (V) who is conducting a vendetta against those who kept him in a detention centre; a mild-mannered heroine, Evie, who is almost gang-raped at the hands of corrupt government thugs; and a rather lovable Stephen Fry playing a closet homosexual TV producer.<br/><br/>What was originally a comic-strip, updating an Orwellian tale of revolt against an authoritarian government to the eighties, has become a movie that updates the same themes to the present day. There's mention of rendition, an all-male cabinet that hearkens only to its leader, extensive use of 'spin', people detained without trial, secret police putting hoods over people's heads Guantanamo bay style, and most importantly the theme of 'terrors that we all face' as an excuse for government clamp downs and erosion of freedoms. For people pulling their hair out over the antics of Bush and Blair, V for Vendetta must seem like great fun in true liberal tradition. Indeed, there's a very intelligent film there somewhere  but this isn't it.<br/><br/>In one scene, Portman (Evey) is about to be abused to the extent she will wish she had never been born. The masked and near-invincible V appears, slays her attackers, and treats her to a barrage of alliteration in which whole paragraphs use words starting with the letter 'V'. Thankful for her deliverance, she is wondering if she has been rescued by a mental case, but V demonstrates some of his pre-arranged demolition jobs set to music. As terrorists go, he's the thoughtful kind, respectful and artistic. Yet any considered analysis of the film gives us little help in deciding whether V is a true hero, saving the nation, or just someone with a heavy personal vendetta that might have the side-effect of getting rid of the bad guys. V's hero, Guy Fawkes, was not a liberator, even though he wanted to blow up parliament (as does V)  he was a Catholic dissident who wanted to destroy the Protestant aristocracy by blowing up the House of Lords and killing the reformer King James I. V wants to overthrow the government not because they are bad, but because they hurt him (and his family) personally, and is quite happy to murder extravagantly and with a certain panache. The two aims do overlap though, and he realises Evie must play a crucial part as the representative of more regular society.<br/><br/>The (Matrix) Wachowski Brothers, who wrote the screenplay, indulge their love of literary association by referencing Shakespeare and the Count of Monte Cristo extensively. The use of colour is striking, jumping from violent red and black to smudgy warm interiors with artistic treasures or the white utilitarian rooms of plebeian offices. Natalie Portman's acting is tolerable, but the film's weakness is that it fails to convey any sense of reality, whether as a believable future society, a symbol of modern day ills, or a political thriller. We are left with the Watchowskis' portmanteau of assorted skills thrown together in an inadequate script, and central characters that add up barely as well as the Joker from Batman and Robin, but with the added baggage of trying to ride the crest of left-wing political comment films without having done the necessary homework. Bereft of its pretensions, V for Vendetta is just about acceptable fare for comic-to-film fans, but otherwise fails to rise above the mid water mark for a night's viewing. Like Superman before him, V is a hero who is portrayed as physically and emotionally emasculated, unable to have normal sexual relations, genetically modified with super strength and near invulnerability  a comic-book fan's wet dream. He ensconces himself in a fortress, venturing out as a god-in-a-cape messianic figure. But when the masses rally to support him in their look-alike masks, we can't help but wonder if they will be capable of instituting an intelligent democracy to replace the order that is overthrown. As a superhero, his philosophy has little to recommend it beyond listening to Julie London classics and imitating the Three Musketeers (unless we add a sympathetic ear for gays and lesbians). Bereft of V's remarkable powers, the pub-soaked working classes watching him on a TV screen seem to offer little hope for an enlightened future."

","This film is easily one of the worst I've ever had the misfortune of sitting through. Loud and overbearing, lacking in any subtly or nuance, heavy-handed message, repetitious and drawn-out. At so many points in the movie, I thought to myself, ""Ok, I get it already, please move along."" It got to a point where if it cut back to John Hurt barking at his subordinates from his giant video monitor one more time, I'd be heading for the exits.<br/><br/>In almost all cases, I can understand why critics and/or the public enjoy a film that I dislike, but this case baffles me. I can only imagine that with such a large number of people currently in disagreement with the decisions/actions of the US government and others, a story of rebellion satiates their state of unrest.<br/><br/>However, I fail to see the entertainment value of watching a guy who reminds me of one of the puppets from Mr. Roger's Land of Make-Believe go from The Phantom of the Opera to Betty Crocker to The Matrix's Neo, all the while prattling on using alliteration and wordplay meant to be clever and thought-provoking, but it's just tedious nonsense.<br/><br/>It's a fiasco, folks. If you can't see that, you just want a global leadership shift so badly that it's clouded your vision of what makes a good film.<br/><br/>As awful as one of the RoboCop sequels.

"Jakealope","4","14","28","8 October 2010"," Pulp Political Posturing, Just an Overgrown Comic Book
","OK, with the budget, crew and actors, it was well made, no doubt top shelf UK production on a technical side. But as a political parable it just sucked. It mixed modern left leaning tropes about 9/11 Truther nonsense about the government staging false terrorist attacks to gain power with some straw man right wing Xtians as the all around bad guys. It had John Hurt as the erstwhile dictator, just like those other movies where he played some 30s style dictator or subject of one. I am no fan of the Xtain right here in the US, and while this film was made in the age of Bush, I also found the insinuation that those backwards moralizing phonies, fundamentalists & geeks are really blood thirsty tyrants to be too much of a stretch, considering NONE of those 30s style dictators were vary religious, with the exception of Franco, who was the least insidious of that crew.<br/><br/>Also, the typical one man army concept, our V, who can kick ass and slash 100s of armed opponents is so freaking stupid & stale, it deserves to be knocked flat on that count alone. He also seems to have unlimited resources, like the money and cut outs needed to mail 8 million Guy Fawkes masks to random people, and access to all sorts of explosives & public buildings etc. that any totalitarian police state worth its salt would detect in less than a month. There is no subtlety. A gay TV personality played by Stephen Fry, a friend of our put upon heroine, makes some lame TV satire of the terrorist and exalted leader. For this you'd expect him to be maybe fired and exiled unless he recants, but the evil leader has him killed in front of the cowering heroine, who was hiding in his house.<br/><br/>Finally, as proof of stupidity masking as the profound, Guy Fawkes, the 17th Century Catholic who tried to blow up Parliament with barrels of gunpowder, is the proto hero and the inspiration for our un-named V, who wears a Guy Fawkes mask throughout the movie as more than a disguise. To English people this is known as the Gunpowder Plot and its thwarting is celebrated as Guy Fawkes Day. Well, weren't the Catholics back then the religious zealots who were trying to get England back in the Roman Catholic Church fold? For a movie that pans Christian fascism and exalts freedom, it would be like having whores and strippers march for chastity. So much for comic book politics!"

","If you really think about it, V himself is kind of sexy. I mean you have a man who always wears the same mask but has different emotions and persona's. Even though the mask never changes, one can understand the emotions beyond the mask and really feel for the character. When he's angry you can feel it regardless of that grin, and when he's sad or upset that's visible as well. (Possible Spoilers) At the end when Evey begs him to stay and kisses the mask on the lips, you can almost feel him tremble and when he says I can't, the voice is one of a man trapped in hell because he wants to stay with her but also needs to finish what he started. When he stumbles back after the last fight and collapses in her arms, he tells her that even though he's glad its almost over, he never expected to fall in love again or rather didn't think he was capable again after the last time. Despite the same black clothes and the same wig, hat, and that Guy Fawkes mask, you can tell that he loves her with all of his heart. A heart that has been scarred with the horrors of his life, but still just before he dies you can feel him redeemed because of her. Even though this movie is packed with action its also a really high-tech future-istic love story. At first I thought that V should have let Evey see his face but than I realized that it made him who he was trying to be and others to see. It's because of that, I think made him very appealing to women; power, gentleness, and love behind the mystery. He wasn't there for evil, he was there to stop it, to bring it down, with revenge and some serious skill. All of us women, need a little V in our lives.<br/><br/>10/10 ~ definite recommendation."

Hugo weaving hams it up spectacularly behind a grinning mask who has a practically schizophrenic personality (seriously, if we are to believe that this man is a cold-blooded freedom fighter, we do not need to see him flipping pancakes). Natalie Portman proves beyond all doubt that she cannot act for toffee, and gets by on attractiveness alone. Stephen Fry makes the best use of a badly written character, but even he is below his usual standard. The rest of the cast were perfectly unmemorable.<br/><br/>The film was V.

","This movie adaptation of the graphic novel is an astounding feast for the eyes, thought food for your head and a emotive testament to the power of people in the face of adversity. The original 'comic' was set in a fictional version of neo-Nazi Thatcher era Britain, but taking out actual historical figures (apart from Guy Fawkes) gives the piece a much bigger net to cast. With enough fantastic fight scenes, and things blowing up to keep the action fans happy, V brings a multi-layered complexity, poetry and wit that one does not usually associate with this kind of movie. Even though it is fiercely British (the dismissive and passing references to the civil war in ""the former United States"" is a powerful backdrop) one of the things that gives this movie such a resounding impact is the parallels that can be drawn to current world events. If power corrupts, then absolute power corrupts absolutely. It looks at how governments control the media, mutate and mold the publics perceptions and use questionable methods to their own ends. The tag line of 'People should not be afraid of their Governments, Governments should be afraid of their people', is such a powerful and brave thing to say in this day and age when countries all over the world initiate sedition and treason laws. It's theatrical release was held back in the UK due to the London bombings and it's easy to understand why, but I'll spare you the spoilers. Their are some incredible performances, Natalie Portman as Evie gives perhaps the best performance of her career. John Hurt's malevolent High Chancellor is a seething cauldron of hatred. Stephen Fry as Gordon is magnificent and gives a glimpse of what I hope will be more dramatic roles for him. And then there is V, played by Hugo Weaving, who although you never see his face gives a remarkable portrayal full of humour, madness, righteous vengeance and tenderness. That mask will forever evoke strong feeling in me. V FOR VENDETTA is an absolute must see movie."

"pfgpowell-1","3","13","26","20 June 2009"," Banal, pretentious and extraordinarily silly.
","What an extraordinarily silly film V For Vendetta turns out to be. It is almost breathtaking in its banality. And the odd things is that for the first 10/15 minutes you feel you are in for something quite enjoyable. To begin with it is intriguing: who is this guy in the Guy Fawkes mask, what will happen to Natalie Portman, just how did to Old Blighty end up as a fascist dictatorship, what is the mystery of the Larkhill Centre? And most important, how did V acquire his almost superhuman powers, what are his resources (for example, towards the end of the film apparently issuing, at the very least, most of the population of London with a Guy Fawkes mask, a hat and a black cape like his own. Couldn't have been much of a queue at the post office when he went.) But we get no answers at all, at least none which will satisfy anyone with even half a brain. And when I say it just gets sillier and sillier, I don't in any way mean that the silliness can, as it often is in films, enjoyably silly. V For Vendetta takes itself far too seriously for that. We get a load of half-baked, juvenile cod political philosophy, an entirely obscure storyline about the persecution of both male and female homosexuals (and where did that come from. It is shoehorned into the film so maladroitly that it's as though a new film is starting) some silliness about Guy Fawkes falling in love with Natalie Portman and a couple of coppers who aren't quite as bad as the rest of those in authority. There are obvious points to be made - would the whole police investigation of this 'terrorist' really consist of a chief inspector and his sidekick (not, alas, a lovable but rather stupid cockney)? How does this idiot in the mask get around London undetected - he sticks out like a sore thumb. And just how did Britain accept a fascist dictatorship. But even asking those questions means taking V For Vendetta even a little but seriously and - well, it really doesn't deserve it. It is, to use an old-fashioned British phrase, complete b*ll*ks which goes downhill all the way. The Wachowski brothers (with Larry now apparently - according to IMDb - now shacked up with a 'professional dominatrix' who 'keeps him as her slave': put that in your pipe and smoke it) were responsible for the Matrix franchise. I haven't seen any of them, but if V For Vendetta is anything to go by, I shan't be bothering this side of my death. It is lazy, pretentious, superficial and a waste of anyone's time. I did think of being a little bit charitable and allowing that as it was apparently co-produced by DC Comics, it might score if you saw it as a filmed comic. But that won't wash. V For Vendetta takes itself far too seriously to be allowed any charitable leeway."
"TOMASBBloodhound","6","13","26","11 October 2006"," This film in the top 250? I think not.
","V for Vendetta is an ambitious, but tragically flawed film from such minds as Wachowski, Wachowski, and Silver. The story centers around the efforts of a masked hero/villain who wishes to take down a fascist government which has seized power in 2020 London. V, as he's known, is quite a character. He can carve up an entire unit of policemen with guns while at the same time quoting Shakesparre. He seems to be everywhere at once as the government is unable to nab him or even slow him down. He boasts that on the fifth of November of the following year, he's going to pull off some elaborate stunt that will somehow bring the government to it's knees. Can he be stopped? Should he be stopped? In the simplest of terms, this film has good things and bad things in it. The good: Well, the acting was very good. Hugo Weaving, though he's hidden under a mask for the entire film, gives everything he can to the role of V. He speaks with an eloquence, he moves like a cat, and he's given all the best lines. Natalie Portman is better than you'd think as the young woman who helps and is helped by V after getting into a sticky situation with some corrupt cops in an early scene. Her despair and disillusionment harden to resolve quite believably by the film's end. Stephen Rea is terrific as a detective trying to get to the bottom of the mystery man's plot. John Hurt is appreciated in no matter what role he plays in any film. The film is a treasure to look at, despite the numerous grisly scenes used to depict this terrible world of the future.<br/><br/>There are numerous problems with this film, however. Hugo Weaving does his best, but the V character is simply lacks credibility. Is he in fact some genetically enhanced former political prisoner, or is he some sort of superhero? Why is he able to defeat a room full of police armed with automatic pistols when he has only knives, and a mask which allows him no peripheral vision? Why can he take several bullets, then not show any effect from them until after he has disposed of all his adversaries? Why does he waste time setting up thousands of dominoes and knock them down for an audience of only himself? Just to throw in some overly-obvious symbolism to the dialog being spoken? Well, it did look pretty cool when they fell, I guess.<br/><br/>The society these people live under is simply preposterous. A fascist regime like this will never see the light of day no matter how many telephone calls our governments listen in to. The totalitarian regime of this ""Sutler"" character is such a straw dog that a slight draft of wind could blow it over. Why do filmmakers and artists always think the future will be so negative? Why is the Church almost always thought of a source of evil or hypocrisy in so many films? Enough of this rant.....<br/><br/>You probably won't hate V for Vendetta. You may actually love it. I for one thought it was ""okay"". I liked the acting, but thought that the political point it was trying to make was about as subtle as a cockroach crawling across a white rug. -A little quote from the movie JFK, for those of you who may or may not have recognized it.<br/><br/>6 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."

It was predictable and beyond pretentious. To like this, you have to believe the West and in particular the US are are fascist states and the only remedy is to blow everything up. Now that's a mature way to look at perceived problems in our world!!!! The scenes where Evey is being interrogated but it turns out to be V testing her, to help rid her of fear so that she can commit terrorist acts, is unconscionable. It's a homage in how to train a suicide bomber. I knew Ms. Portman was interested in far Left politics, I guess this is her ode to them. It's also a bigoted film in that Christianity is stereotyped in the absolute worse possible ways. The TV personality is a racists, Muslin hating homophobic and the Bishop is a pedophile. If you had of treated any other group this way their would've been protests. So this is a film that plays to an adoring constituency and will turn off anyone who isn't like minded. It PREACHES(not stop,Ad nauseam) to the choir, the choir in their xenophobia love it."

","The first time I saw this movie, I saw it for free and let me tell you, if it was not free I would have wanted my money back. After it came out on DVD I watched it again about 3 times because everyone I know loved it and I had to find out what I missed that made this movie so good...I couldn't find it. This movie was like watching the news except for about four action sequences, all of which are in the preview. The so called plot twist when Evey was in prison was easy to figure out and not even a good twist at that. I have not read the graphic novel but I hope it was better than the film. I enjoy a lot of other films by Portman and Weaving (Leon, The Matrix etc.) and really wanted to enjoy this film. The acting was good and Hugo did a good job acting out a character that couldn't show facial expressions but other than that I cant see anything worth talking about in this movie."

","I've seen this movie a dozen times or more since it came out back in 2005. Even as a teenager I saw in it what it was expressing, so I'd revisit the film from time to time for my own sake because there are some valuable things laced within it's screenplay. It was sorta silly and sloppily put together I agree with some reviews but the thing for myself, the more I rewatched it..... the less I critiqued the little stuff the less I looked at it as a goofy messy film in spite of all its historical role play or Shakespeare's lingo. The more I sat down and actually watched the film listened to the stories wrapped with stories within it..... the more I began to appreciate the entire film. The more I began to understand that this film has it all literally, it's not trying to be something it's not people. It's trying to help us as the audience. It has the corruption the intrigue the murder the lies the way the people just idly stand by because they the people KNOW who's fault it is that put them into this mess..... and you all think a typical answer *Oh well it's the big bad government that has the citizens the people locked up and stripped of their individual rights blah blah blah*...... Nope I'm sorry if that's all YOU see within this film than I guess it's intricacies will be lost on you. The more I watched this film the more I had this glorious feeling, sure it's got the scared heroine who gets freed from her own fears blah blah blah with the addition of the freedom fighter himself called V who is all mystic and bad ass. He carries the heart of the story while laced into the plots horrific past transgressions. <br/><br/>This film has one single reverberating stamp on it that not many choose to acknowledge or see upon only watching it once..... took me a few tries before it struck me..... this movie is a giant 2x4 hit to the face to the people, as in US! It is one that pleads with us you *KNOW* who's ""FAULT"" it is that Its people and citizens are in this predicament now. The people, the country's own citizens, they elected its government, they begged and cheered for its leadership to sit on the seat of power. <br/><br/>The ONLY one to blame for those in the seat of government power and social structure is none other than the *""PEOPLE""* themselves. <br/><br/>The film somewhat glosses over this Single but vital thought throughout it..... but it was not lost on me. They have it woven within the film so well that it is bound to be missed by those who are merely content to watch it at the surface and no further. <br/><br/>It's a good film to revisit with all this government bs going on now in America. I could care less about Trump or Hilary what I am MORE concerned about is how passively desensitized to literally everything, all we care about is winning and making ourselves happily blissfully unaware and untroubled..... we can't be bothered to actually live life. All we care about is the latest technology how fast it goes, material wealth, money and personal gain. It makes me sick to see as THE PEOPLE of this country how far we have sunk. As a whole this is the truth. You know it and I know it."
"abrondz","Null","7","12","29 October 2009"," ""1984"" gone mainstream
","While watching V for Vendetta recently, I couldn't help getting a distinct feeling I'd seen something very similar before. And I had, it was a few months earlier and it was called 1984.<br/><br/>1984 isn't as easy to grasp as V for Vendetta. You need to go into the plot to understand what's going on. V for Vendetta makes that a whole lot easier by adding a villain which anyone can get to know and a main character who goes from being conformist to oppositional through the course of the film. In addition there is an ultimate goal instead of the entire film just being a description of life in an completely authoritarian state.<br/><br/>This is all very nice, unfortunately V for Vendetta fails to impress.<br/><br/>The symbolism of November 5th is at times taken too far. Despite the entire plot being built around Guy Fawkes and the blowing up of the parliament, the reasons behind it are too weak to make an entire film out of it. Having said that, I'm sure films have been built on less. Furthermore, the idea of a villain who's there to save the world, or in this case, Britain, has been severely worn out by now. As always, the villain is hiding behind a mask. Why?<br/><br/>All in all, if you liked and understood ""1984"", you'll be disappointed."

","It's just so typical of dumb asses on the IMDb to overrate this tired, badly written piece of nonsense. The overuse of bad explanatory speeches/ dialogue combined with its simplistic didacticism really grated - the film offered a cheesy crash course in political subversion/ rebellion for cretins. The love story was irrelevant, sentimental and completely uniteresting because the charcterisation was so lame - princess amrilla's character was nothing more subtle than the pretty scared girlie who grows a political conscience and a bit of courage. The direction and editing were hackneyed, dull and predictable. The photography was stunningly flat and badly framed, just boring -take the shot of the English people watching telly - it was like a particularly tedious Kodak moment from a family album."
"classicsoncall","9","7","12","3 April 2006"," ""Then you have no fear anymore, you are completely free.""
","Is terrorism enacted against a terrorist government acceptable? That is the central haunting question presented in ""V For Vendetta"", a stylish thriller nominally adapted from the comic book of the same name. That the film comes out now is not surprising, what is though is that the source material was originally published in 1988/89, pre-dating by a decade a global world in which terrorism has become a household word.<br/><br/>Comparisons drawn to Nazi Germany are probably apt, as the film's reining government and it's leader Sutler (John Hurt) have succeeded in convincing the masses what to sleep, eat and think. The revelation of Sutler's inhuman plot to save his country's citizens from a self induced plague that killed eighty thousand people seems utterly unbelievable, yet a real life Hitler found it prudent to kill nearly eight times as many to insure racial hegemony. It's interesting to note that the level of V's violence was tempered to each victim's own arrogance and complicity. Dr. Surridge (Sinead Cusack) as an example was already dead before she even knew it, dispassionate in the knowledge of her guilt and almost welcoming it.<br/><br/>In a field of outstanding portrayals, Natalie Portman excels as the tormented accomplice Evey Hammond. Her performance arcs over an entire spectrum of characterizations and emotions, and not once did I feel her reactions were forced or unnatural. She grows Evey from an ambivalent, unthinking member of the hive to a leader, with more courage and determination than allowing herself credit for. It will be interesting to see if she's given credit for her performance a year from now in the next Academy Award go round.<br/><br/>The film prompts me to seek out the trade paperback of the original story as scripted by Alan Moore in a ten issue run. My curiosity is also piqued as to Moore's public disavowal of the movie, for that I'll have to learn more. Also while still on the subject, the movie's opening credits Vertigo, an imprint of DC Comics, which was not involved in the original publication.<br/><br/>With a movie of such complexity, another viewing is probably a worthwhile endeavor to pick up the threads that might have been overlooked the first time around. However if all you're interested in is an action movie, this is one you probably want to stay away from. Action it has, but it's the subtext and message that should be grabbing you, not the wizardry of flashing weapons."

"eemeilia","5","10","19","18 August 2010"," An OK movie, neutral experience, nothing so special
","This movie is good enough, if you have to kill time. It's not a bad movie, but it must have made it to top 250 movies because of its political appeal to the reviewers, not because of any cinematographic achievements. It's a political statement, for an imaginary political situation. I think part of the appeal to some people is, that they see the real world in the way the movie, thus they can better relate to the characters.<br/><br/>As a movie it's just an average Hollywood movie. In the special effects and in ways of shooting the scenes, it borrows from some earlier benchmark movies, but looses in quality to them. The plot is far from mind blowing and has no big surprises. Just what you would expect as you watch it.<br/><br/>My guess is that you will like it more if you are politically to the left and like the idea of having to fight for your idea i.e. like political activism. And you better not like Christianity, as in the movie Christianity is referred through a Hitler like dictator and a corrupt pedophile bishop."

","Just saw this movie, this is a first impression. The acting was good but the scenario had some flaws. there was a lot of talking and nice quotes for a political statement that just didn't pack the punch. Too long, too slow and nothing breath taking or jaw dropping. I was waiting for the final cut or the big surprise behind the whole thing and was honestly disappointed in the end. The logic of the characters is hard to follow and the 'mix' between the action and political drama did not bode well. It could of been a great action movie or a great political thriller, not a hybrid... As for the action, it was great, nice camera work and good effect but the scenario didn't follow..."

","All five of the stars I gave it go to Hugo Weaving for making the best out of a bad situation. This movie has multiple personalities, jumping from thrilling to slap stick in a heartbeat, which is probably because the man who took on the massive project has never directed anything before, and it shows. A lot. The dialogue is, well, bad. It's embarrassing at times, actually. The mask V wears the whole time, along with the hair cut, is down right creepy and, while the creepiness decreases as the movie chugs along, it never really goes away. VfV had me rolling my eyes at more than one point, raising my eyebrow once, and almost laughing about three times.

Indeed, it is quite a bit more. In fact I would go so far as to proclaim it is the best film of this genera, I have seen in years. There are many special qualities of a classic film and this one has them all. There is violence, suspense, drama, revenge, romance, comedy, intrigue, excitement and of course, mystery of character. Most of all, this film has Chancellor Adam Sutlet (John Hurt) who embodies the unbridled and ruthless power of a brutal government. Arrayed against him is V, superbly and adroitly played by extremely talented Hugo Weaving. The story is that of a dark hero who is condemned to unspeakable torture and imprisonment returns from certain dead to strike terror into the heart of an established totalitarian system which created him. Using the facade of a dead anarchist, Wearing plays a dangerous cat and mouse game with the police and the dictator, using both special effects and a dazzling dexterity with knives. His aim, to allow society to awaken from apathy and reclaim it's government. A must film for any modern citizen who remains reluctant to find fault with it's present malevolent government. ****"

I truly was pleasantly surprised at some of the turns the plot made and took great enjoyment in not being able to second guess what would happen next. Further, Portman's acting ability really shines in this role. Her portrayal of Evey added a human dimension to the movie that kept this movie from being just a superficial film rendition of the comic book. The acting, directing, and visual effects wove together well to create a believable alternate reality in which the viewer could immerse themselves."

"tedreddi","10","10","19","27 June 2006"," V for Theatrical Victory
","V for Theatrical Victory My thumbs have been taken some heavy damage over the years. One year, my right thumb was broke due to a wrestling accident. Then, last year, I needed my left thumb surgically repaired... due to a wrestling accident. But, fortunately, both are back to working order. And both are pointing at the sky for V for Vendetta.<br/><br/>During the Vendetta, we follow the story of Evey, who is played very well by Natalie Portman. Evey starts out as a damsel in distress who works for the only TV network in London, but ends a faithful apprentice to the draw of the movie, V. V is an anarchist with the intent of making this futuristic London fall and having the people rebuild it when the gov't ceases to exist. And how does V plan to do this, you ask? Why, blowing up Parliament, of course! Evey first meets V when London's law enforcers called ""fingers"" catch her after the curfew instated by Chancellor Sutler (the enemy of the movie). The fingers were going to gang-rape her for being out late. That is until V shows up and beats them so hard they couldn't remember what they had for tea. (those Englishmen, always thinking with their weiners ) V, being a gentleman, decides to treat Evey to a night on the town. But this isn't like a County Fair and ice cream date. Nope, not even close. He leads her to the top of a building and pulls out a Conductor's wand used for symphonies and faces a large statue on to of a nearby building. Evey's very curious as to why he's doing this, but then, you'll faintly hear the Overture of 1812. And just as the cannons sound in the classical score, the building is exploded from the inside, reducing it to rubble.<br/><br/>The next day, V holds Evey's TV station hostage and urges them to play a pre-recorded broadcast V had made. This make-shift news report thoroughly explains why he's going to explode Parliament up and why the common people of Foggy Town should join him. V states this will take place one year from when his broadcast was made, on the 5th of November. The rest of the movie deals with all the events that take place in that one year. Including uncovering the Government's many conspiracies, Learning about V's backstory and why he's assassinating various members of the Government, and how Evey plays into all of this.<br/><br/>Ideals: This movie isn't really an action title as many (including myself) believed. This is all about raging against the Machine and how the citizens of ANY nation have the true power. One of the most stressed ideas was Censorship and Individualism. Most pop/current music was taken away. Many modern and classical arts disappeared when this gov't took over. It's not just limited to that though. None of London's citizens were permitted to have religious texts or have feelings for members of the same sex. That being said, I can introduce you to Deitrich, a closeted homosexual who is host of a late night show on television. Along with the news, Deitrich's scripts are already written, lacking voice and reason, and usually covers up the Chancellors mistakes. (whoa, how appallingly ironic) This was until one night, he throws out the written script and added his own. This one show mused on how the people of London live under control of the Chancellor. The special guests of the night were actors paid to look like Chancellor Sutler and V. V played childish pranks on Sutler throughout the show, and when they caught V, they unmasked him, only to show another Sutler. (which of course meant he's the only terrorist in London) After the show was aired, the secret police attacked Deitrich at his house. Deitrich played kind of a Malcolm X or Che Guevara for the film. I think the movie wouldn't be half of what it was without him.<br/><br/>Writing: I'll admit that this was one of the best written movie's I've seen since Million Dollar Baby. Larry and Andy Wachowski did a much better job on this than the Matrix sequels. But the bros. lose some credit simply because V for Vendetta was already a comic book published by DC Comcics in the 80's. But there're quotes in here that will stick in the back of your mind for a very long time. Quotes such as ""Beneath this mask there is more than flesh. There is an idea, Mr. Creedy, and ideas are bulletproof."" Instant classic. And then there's this view V and I both share. ""People should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people."" How true, how true.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a perfectly balanced movie. If there's a fight scene, there's an in depth conversation or plot-twist. Vendetta also covers the grounds of vengeance, life, and even love, believe it or not. This film is simply brilliant on every level. Natalie Portman is no Emile de Ravin, but I can let it slide this time. This movie provoked though, satisfied my taste for mayhem, and is just a good rebel-rousing movie. Fans of Fight Club or Run Lola Run will definitely love it. Two thumbs up, two thumbs way up.<br/><br/>-Theodore Reddinger"

I'll admit to being somewhat of a conspiracy theorist, and also admit to being rather mistrustful of our (US - G W H Bush) government. This movie though, should serve as a warning to all that may chose to give up 'liberties' to gain some vague 'security.'

","I will start out by saying that this movie was actually an OK movie. It got really dull around the middle of the movie when it was very clear that they were no longer reading the book for advice. many of the characters do not fulfill the roles they play in the story and many of the stories best scenes are taken out, to be replaced by scenes that actually take away from the emotional dexterity of the movie.<br/><br/>There are two characters in the movie who are done very much like in the graphic novel, they are Evey Hammond and V, other than that, almost everything is different. Some scenes are similar, but small changes are made. In stead of playing Billie holiday in the shadow gallery he plays Diana Krall. Nothing major, but you also lose out on seeing how he gets away with all the stuff he does, you don't see all the artwork he really has and you do not see the emotional attachment to v and every that was clearly displayed in the book.<br/><br/>This movie was, at best, an OK movie, but it was a horrible adaptation. I do not see why people take a work they respect and mutilate it beyond recognition. I realize there are things one must change from one medium to another, for time or because simply it would make a boring film to watch people listen to a radio, rather than watch TV. How ever, there are some things that need to be left in tact, things that are crucial to the plot and characters.<br/><br/>I can see why Alan Moore was unsatisfied with the movie. you would think that after seeing the success Sin City had, that directors and such would want the movie to be as the original material was. What is the point for adapting a story if, in the end, you are not telling the same story?"
"Greeboina","1","20","44","26 March 2006"," A huge letdown...
","Hmmmm...I wonder if I saw a different movie than those who have praised VfV. Many of the praising are something I can't recall as masterpieces. I am not Christian, I've seen the movie and it sucked.<br/><br/>What went wrong? The virus aspect, the characters being changed so much from the comic, Natalie Portman's cringe-worthy aspect and that it was so full with less than subtle 'America- Dangerous, Religious and Conservative'. They may have tried to relate it to our time but failed.<br/><br/>The movie needed desperately the darkness but yet hopeful vision that the comic had. The whole Thatcerism forgotten even if it provided a more interesting reason why this happened. You don't have to change decades to make your point so strong. It was like they tried to not offend anyone. Why, I do not know. The 'Falling in love' scene ruined it and Finch's suddenly bigger role. The whole activist part added more to the ruin called VfV. A shame as this movie could have been more than some Matrix ripoff with a bad storyline. The Guy Fawkes turned V into some hero which was never the intention for Alan Moore. V wears that mask and that's about it.<br/><br/>There was something good about it though. Even if Finch's role was so much bigger than in the comic Stephen Rea did a good job. Hugo Weaving's V was more vocal but did a very good job about being this masked terrorist/hero. Deitrich's role had been changed but it worked. The one true thing that were moving were the Valerie & Ruth subplot. It gave the movie a lot more depth and a better message.<br/><br/>It doesn't make up for the faults of this movie. It may not be as bad as the other Moore adaptations but it still doesn't say much. It could have had potential but it was never used. Instead it's a sorry looking attempt at a critical view of this world. An empty shell.<br/><br/>It doesn't make the thought of Watchmen being made into a movie a very uplifting experience. A.

","After seeing a 8.5 stars for this film i thought it was a must see, and i found it very disappointing. The film has for me tends to drag on forever until it reaches a message such as the treatment of Evey's sexuality and in my eyes why her character is related to V's. Too many stale moments though, and it was very boring. For example, the film takes a very long time until we see the unveiling of the character V and why he is the way he is. I found the film really pretentious to me such as the tone of voice used throughout. I must be missing something here I really don't get the 8.5 stars. I must admit though a character in a mask the whole time is not really my type of movie i like movie's that are far more realistic in telling their message so this wasn't enjoyable for me at all."
"malthus86","3","16","34","7 April 2006"," Alan Moore's Curse Holds True.
","Alan Moore is the author of the original graphic novel from which this movie is based. It is a work of literary art from cover to cover and one of my all-time favorite reads, right up there with Virginia Woolf and William Wordsworth. However, there is a Hollywood Curse looming over his head. You see, several of his stories have made it to the big screen, whether you realized it or not. Swamp Thing - 1982 (while he didn't create the character, he reinvented and repopularized him which is what prompted the movie in the first place) From Hell - 2001 The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen - 2003 Also during the 80s another of his works (Watchmen) was opted but the movie fell through before fruition and he's been fighting to get the rights back for years. Now a big studio owns the movie rights and is going ahead with it against his wishes. Why against his wishes? Because every single movie has been an abhorrent perversion of his original work. While it is probably the best movie adaptation of his work, V for Vendetta is still tragically a horrible representation of Moore's message. It was twisted into cheap Hollywood propaganda to try and poke fun at the current US administration. As much as I enjoy anything that take's George W Bush and Co. down a peg or two, I don't enjoy being manipulated, and that's how this movie made me feel. It also veered very far off the point of the graphic novel, by cutting out every significant subplot and twisting the overall idea of V (the graphic novel is about breaking down any and all barriers and boundaries to discover one's true self and connection with the world around you; the movie, on the other hand, pushes an agenda of liberalism within the constricts of currently acceptable western social archetypes) and not to mention the vastly different ending, which was the nail in the coffin for me that the Wachowski Brothers just simply DIDN'T GET IT. The pacing is hindered with the badly timed, badly integrated flashbacks, particularly one of the most important scenes of Evey's discovery of Valerie's note. Without any of the of other storytelling elements of Moore's original graphic novel, the flashbacks feel forced and divisive. Another major flaw is the exceptionally crappy Matrix effects during the ""climatic"" (or rather anti-climatic) end fight scene. It's one thing for bullets to ripple the air in a computer simulation, but another for knives to have ugly windows mouse trails in unnecessary slow motion. The scene had no purpose, no soul, no tension. It was boring. The only saving grace of the film was Hugo Weaving, who provided a perfect voice for the mask. Unfortunately all the best lines from the comic were cut. V was left feeling exceptionally rigid and lucid; calculating and painfully sane. And while calculating he certainly was in the comic, sane he was not. The madness, and therefore the joy of not knowing what he'd say or do next, was lost. His ""plan"" was obvious and uninspired, as was this movie. It didn't make me want to change the world or change myself. It just made me want to write Alan Moore an apology letter for having watched this movie. I could go on and on about how they ruined Evey's character by writing her as too strong, too smart, and too independent and overly romanticized her and V (especially considering how she thought V might be her father in the original work) but I've wasted enough of my time on this movie which I never plan on seeing again."
"TensersFloatingDisk","3","12","24","14 September 2006"," Pretentious, and not even for a good purpose
","Well, the critics have spoken, the box office has spoken, the fans have spoken, and now I will speak:<br/><br/>This movie is junk.<br/><br/>Anyone who thinks this is high-flown political allegory should take a remedial class in civics, and another in history, and yet a third in rhetoric. Anyone who thinks it's art needs to take a shower.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta has none of the flash of the Matrix, but all of the pretentious pseudo-intellectual ""philosophizin'."" It oversimplifies both politics and human nature to the point that none of the characters are remotely believable, nor is their situation. Despite this, it manages to fail even at the level of popcorn fare, yielding not even a satisfactory final scene. Simply put, it's not even technically successful.<br/><br/>Statements which should be the clear bulwark for the opposing forces are mumbled unintelligibly through several layers of cardboard (Mr. Weaving' voice is often-times inaudible. Don't believe me? Go look at the message boards: half of the threads are requests for clarifications on the inaudible dialog). Confrontations like the final fight scene, which should be titanic, are instead grungy and poorly lit (seriously, someone buy the cameraman a mining helmet or something).<br/><br/>And then there are the characters wandering through this pasteboard wasteland. The main bad guy is never seen, and never provides his rationale, rendering him beyond flimsy and certainly no threat. The main hero is similarly opaque, since the filmmakers decided obscurity would somehow seem like wisdom to the sweating masses of fanboys who elevated this dreck. The most emotionally affecting voice comes through a long flashback sequence from a character long-dead. That should tell you something about the characters. <br/><br/>And finally, the politics: shoddy, ill-researched, and venal. All the characters we're supposed to think of as 'noble' seem motivated by the most pettily personal of reasons, with the arguable exception of the main police officer investigating V's actions. That the system would rise, then collapse so spontaneously is not only unrealistic, but irresponsible since young and foolish filmgoers are apt to mistake anarchy for freedom. My worst possible curse upon them would be that they get precisely what they ask for.<br/><br/>Thank all Gods that may be that their safety, the arts, and the world, are in better hands than these."
"Nick1000","2","14","29","18 March 2006"," Thought provoking! - But I don't mean the plot or the dialogue
","The most thought provoking thing about this film is reading the reviews.<br/><br/>The film itself was utter drivel. I had read the reviews before going and thought to myself, ""I can't go wrong picking this one"". It was supposed to have everything that I would want to see in a movie. What a mistake! The action is incidental and third rate. Anyone expecting Matrix type stuff should be sorely disappointed and yet some reviewers praise it.<br/><br/>The acting, with the exception of Weaving and Hurt, was risible. I would particularly single out Natalie Portman as lacking all credibility. It sounded like she had had classes in ""how to speak and comport yourself whilst being tortured"" whilst at her finishing school. And yet many reviewers praise it!<br/><br/>I have not read the graphic novel. I can believe that the characters and setting might work in that format but on film I would have thought that the portrayal of London and Londoners was part of some sort of B-movie comedy spoof - they seem to have been lifted largely from somewhere between 1950 and 1975 with the LCD TV's sticking out as an anachronistic error rather than being the near future (If you put a child in thick black NHS glasses now you would be reported to the social services for mental cruelty). The initial encounter with V is even worse, being clearly inspired by Jack the Ripper movies. The police station was from the 1970s. As for the dialogue, it is not the fact that they keep saying ""bollocks"" that is the problem, it is the way that they say it - It's like they asked the queen to do a rap record and say ""muthafucka"" - it has no conviction or credibility.<br/><br/>I haven't said much about the political message and that is because, despite the reviews, there isn't really much of a message there when you look closely, or at lest nothing worthy of serious reflection. Anyone who thinks that it has anything to do with the present day hasn't watched it. The chancellor is clearly Adolf Hitler not George Bush and certainly not Tony Blair - everyone knows that having an ugly guy shout at people doesn't work anymore - modern politics requires good hair and nice teeth (cabinet members excepted) and that the state is taking over in a much more insidious way than the crude scare mongering of Nazi Germany and V for Vendetta. If you find this thought provoking you are feeble minded! This really scares me because I am genuinely afraid that, if feeble dialogue like this can provoke such thoughts then someone more eloquent could actually incite an anarchist rebellion.<br/><br/>Finally, Guy Fawkes didn't try to blow up parliament because he was a republican nor because the people in general were being oppressed - he tried to blow it up because he was a catholic. True, the suppression of the catholics was bad but it was of a completely different character to V for Vendetta which is more like the general repression of 1984 or the old Soviet Union."

","Before I tell you about the movie,I just want to ask you some questions that may have already raised in your brains at some point of you.Did you ever think that your government is going in a wrong way in many of the situations? Did you ever thought of protesting your government for its wrong deeds? Did you ever question yourself that you are living in a wrong way in disguise? Do you have any enough courage to question your government? Well there may not be perfect answers to these questions but V for Vendetta will make you think and think out of the box if you sit tight to watch it!!!<br/><br/>Every goddamn thing in the movie is a plus point for the audience to watch it. It makes you sit tight on your seat from the beginning to the end with the acting, the cinematography, the effects, and the general vision of this film and the twists and the marvelous dialogues. Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong sociopolitical message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure.<br/><br/>The screenplay is great and awesome. In fact, it's a near-masterpiece. What the Wachowski Brothers have done is find the right balance between the theatrics of the graphic novel, and the solemnity to the richly Victorian narrative. They form a dynamic that plays to both sides, allowing for a story that sparks both political debate and giddy entertainment.<br/><br/>Despite the problem of never seeing Weaving's face( the hero V ), there was good acting and an interesting plot. I bet this is the only movie where you love the hero without even knowing his face.You will love the hero's character and the words he utter.<br/><br/>Hidden behind the creepy mask ,Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor.His character provokes thoughtful questions in future ,and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weaving's performance.Natalie Portman on the other hand also excels,with a convincing accent.She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well.The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled.The rest of the film is superb in its execution.<br/><br/>A spellbinding adventure , exciting action, superb directing and writing and a Sci-Fi film with a thoughtful message,and the first fully satisfying Moore adaptation.This is one of those movies that really sticks in your head long after you watch it though... and it continues to stir and grow... Everything looks beautiful, dark yet vibrant. The cinematography is top notch. The final battle scene brought tears to my eyes.Do not miss 'V for Vendetta'. It's one of the best movies of all time, an eternal classic."

It's not just the amazing action scenes ( especially the explosion of the Houses of Parlement ) or the incredible performances by Natalie Portman as Evie, John Hurt as Chancellor Adam Sutler and Especially Hugo Weaving as V. V is an amazing character and I'd compare him to The Joker played by Heath Ledger from The Dark Knight ( 2008 ) because in every seen The Joker was in it was magnificent. Natalie Portman is an incredible as Evey she really gives it her all and is very believable as a young woman who learns to concur here fears and. becomes almost as important as V. John Hurt as the ruthless dictator Adam Sutler is great and is a very believable villain you really start to feel anger towards the atrocities he has committed and the lives he's destroyed. My full analysis of V For Vendetta is that it is one of the most underrated movies of all time and is a really great experience if you love action movies or political dramas then you will love this mix of both i give V For Vendetta a 10/10"

I felt as though everything was going so fast, I couldn't breath, listen, register, and sink in the words and thoughts of the movie. And it was surprising how Eve & V from the beginning were so comfortable with each other. Natalie played Eve as though there was no real character choices. Like it was her portraying herself instead of the character. The movie makes me want to read the book, and see for myself. And I've read and watched F451, 1985, etc... and this movie reminded me of a combination of those books.

Particularly sickening was the line about sacrificing a building for some hope. What tripe. Entertaining? Yes. Good movie? NO WAY.<br/><br/>This story would never have flown if it were set in the US, say DC, NYC, or Philly instead of London. The theme is the same.

","After watching this movie, I had to agree with an earlier posting which stated that this movie didn't really present a believable totalitarian regime. When the troops stormed in after the Benny Hill skit, I half expected the bloke to blurt: ""How dare you barge in here during tea!??!"" You need to present a really dour, Machiavellian political atmosphere, where all sense of personal freedom is removed. Where the threat of brutalities is as horrifying as the brutalities themselves. Characters with muted personalities, indicating fearful oppression, but yet moments of humanity peeking through (1984, Fahrenheit 451, Handmaid's Tale, THX 1138) and the hero should begin like all the others, no different than they are, except for a courageous ability to rebel. For as long as there is even only one defiant character, the world is saved. There hasn't been a movie like that in a long time. Just look at what they did to the remake of 'Rollerball' - I'm afraid to see what they'll do to 'Logan's Run'."

There was never a dull moment. When I say never a dull moment I don't mean explosions and bullets every second but a very well developed plot.

","An interesting forecast of events which reflect very clearly the dangers of 1939-45 which might have been presaged in 1933 with a little more attention. Makes you wary of the danger of incremental power accretions while providing an entertaining and emotive experience. Natalie Portman was finally given a role in which she could flex some acting muscles after the disasters that were her lines in Star Wars and Hugo Weaving excels at imparting emotion without having to reveal his face - acting with only his voice, he demonstrated a real appreciation of his craft and testified to the potency of words alone. There were certainly some scenes inappropriate for children and yet there were also scenes that need to be seen, images of things that might have happened, could be happening and are likely to happen so long as the public remains acquiescent. Although the movie preys on current fears and worst-case scenarios, it is well to remember that it is a commentary on the potency of fear as a weapon of power, and not confined to the specifics of contemporary environments. The movie made good use of evocative symbolism, music and dialog as well."
"vikingfan89","10","9","17","3 April 2006"," More than a shoot -'em-up
","V for Vendetta had the makings of a typical Hollywood movie filled with explosions, blood and violence. But the Wachowski brothers created a film with multiple levels of meaning that the trailers failed to even begin decoding. It is set more than 20 years in the future in England where a masked man attempts to change the world. There are elements of Hitler's rise to power through the induction of fear, the mystery of Phantom of the Opera, but most importantly an inquisitive protagonist similar to the one found in Orwell's 1984. The theme is evident: People should not be afraid of their government; the government should be afraid of the people. Through ingenious acts of deception and illusion, the main character, V, shapes Evie, a girl he rescues in an alleyway. As a common woman, she represents all of society. She has the ability to incite change but is unsure how to go about it. V's acts come across as horrendous to some, but for those attentively listening to his rationale, seems so logical. A higher-thinking member of the audience will be able to draw parallels to present life and come the horrific realization we better take care of the future before we fall victim to the same totalitarian rule."

I have not read any of the comics so I went to the film with no knowledge of it and no preconceptions of what it should be like. And I am glad I didn't. Hugh Weaving was well cast and he gave the character of V great charisma, wit and made him strangely attractive ( although that could just be me). Natalie Portman's character Evey was good and provided the typical love interest but the way the film ends, with V dying just after they realise how they feel about each other was well shot and portrayed the emotions felt by both characters. However, I don not think that she is a particularly good actress as some of her scenes are quite wooden, although this could also just be the fact that her lines weren't as interesting or as well written as V's. In general, however, the film is astonishing. The acting, the plot-line and that final scene of the Houses of Parliament blowing up make one leave the cinema completely blown away and the film is definitely a diamond in the rough of other recent releases which just cannot compare!"

","It's the late 2020s and London is ruled by a fascist government. A vigilante known only as V is trying to stop the government from ripping people's freedoms away by using a danger plan involving terrorist attacks and well timed murders. The movie follows Evey, a young woman who plays the key role to V's plan without even knowing. The movie starts with V, the vigilante, jumping down from the rooftops and saving Evey from a group of England's oppressive law enforcement. Afterwards, he inquires that Every come with him to see something he had set up. She reluctantly follows to see that he has blown up a government building and hacked into all of the speakers around the city which he had made to be shouting classical music as the building exploded into the night sky, fireworks streaking through the air. As the movie goes, gets into trouble as he sends a message to the whole town over a government frequency about how they have been censoring everything and stands for and stifling the whole city to ensure their rule. He also comments that in one year of the explosion he will act again, but even bigger and more destructive. The rest of the film follows Evey as she tries to survive on the run as the year passes. This movie focuses a lot around the idea of rights and how the government can control its people. Throughout the movie we see the government use censorship to control how the people act and feel. During V's first terrorist attack he plays classical music. The government bans this music from being played to do this to try and make people forget the event. Another instance in the movie where censorship came into play was near the end when they banned any clothes that looked like V's clothes to try and deter people from helping him or following in his footsteps. This movie is great representation of why civil rights are so important and is in general a really great movie."

He is an extremist, like the government he seeks to destroy.

I enjoyed reading some of the shrill negative reviews of the film from certain persons concerned overly with a perceived comparison between Nazi Germany and the Bush Administration  gee, why so sensitive about that I wonder?. These are certainly missing the point when claiming the Nazis were a leftist party, and thus the message of the film is bogus  since fascist regimes rise to power under the guise of many of political ideologies, but they seem to use the same tactics to accomplish such goals.<br/><br/>There were some rather clever bits in the film (spoiler alert) that were particularly notable, such as the media referring to the single individual V as a ""terrorist organization"". The attempt to explain away a building destroyed in an actual attack as a ""controlled demolition"" was also darkly ironic.

","ebert and roeper said they couldn't understand what the movie was trying to criticize in our own society which i thought was pretty obvious. <br/><br/>the patriot act takes away many of our rights ""for our own protection""-- in the movie they terrorized society with a virus which they used to scare the ppl into submission. bush and his cabinet listening in on ppls conversations and ordering online search engines to hand over our online searches. <br/><br/>also, even the news on TV in the movie was similar to the news we get in our homes every night: frightening. we get plenty of ""tune in tonight to see violence, sex, or both"" all the time. they do it to get ratings but it creates a terrified society. they did that with 911 and the terrorism, scare the ppl into submission. take advantage of their vulnerability."

","V FOR VENDETTA is one seriously misconceived movie.<br/><br/>It has so many plot-holes (re: the way the film conceives a totalitarian world; civil war in the US, etc) that I could not get into it at all.<br/><br/>It had so many silly scenes (the Benny Hill bit for example) which took me out completely from the film, and I just couldn't get into it.<br/><br/>The whole thing is so blatantly derivative of other sources (Orwell's 1984, obviously...and THE ABOMINABLE DR PHIBES, just to name a few...) that I simply couldn't get into it.<br/><br/>The film is so cheap looking (High concept movies on a low budget never work) that I simply couldn't get into it.<br/><br/>The characters were so annoying or one dimensional, or so few, that I couldn't get into it.<br/><br/>The plot points are so sketchy (Natalie being kidnapped and brainwashed...with that treacly ""love letters"" story; the moment when V has to murder that nurse) that I just couldn't get into it at all.<br/><br/>The acting was so stilted and barely there that I just couldn't get into it.<br/><br/>The action scenes were so ridiculously conceived (the moment when V throws the knives in slow motion at the policemen) that I simply could not get into it.<br/><br/>The ending is so derivative of SPARTACUS that, even by the end of the movie, I still could not get into V FOR VENDETTA.<br/><br/>But mainly because the intellect behind this film is so juvenile and obvious ( a teen version of 1984?) that I will categorically never get into this seriously misconceived flick EVER.<br/><br/>Almost as bad as the equally misconceived EQUILIBRIUM."
"LinnenLove87","9","8","15","19 July 2006"," '' V..'' is a great movie, also beautiful to watch
","Ever since I saw the trailer for V for Vendetta I just knew I had to see it. Now that I have, I simply can't wait for it to come out on DVD. I will buy it straight away! And that is something I don't say that easily..<br/><br/>This film is equal in originality and beauty. The story of the mysterious hero ''V'' who tries to make the people see just who their government really is and that they should take their lives in their own hands again and his new-found accomplice Evey is highly interesting to watch. Also, you feel for all the characters right from the start. Due to the deliciously evil John Hurt, who plays the vicious high chancellor Sutler, it is without problems you will find yourself siding with the rebels in no time.<br/><br/>The manner in which the story is told is very intense, making sure you are right there in the middle with the characters. It's like a puzzle; pieces start falling in the right places piece by piece; filling you in on the plot when the time's right. This film also is utmost pleasant to watch because of the way it was shot. The colours (uniforms, flags, symbols and so on) and the objects hidden inside the hide-out of our hero ''V'' are amazing and the entire feeling of the story is simply breath-taking.<br/><br/>As much as acting is concerned; the wonderfully cast Hugo Weaving delivers a stunning and very impressive role as ''V'' and also Natalie Portman, who I have always liked on screen, shows her true talent as the young, innocent Evey who learns that sometimes you have to fight for what you believe in, no matter what. I also immensely enjoyed the sadly, brief- performance of Stephen Fry, who played Evey's boss Gordon Dietrich.<br/><br/>The action sequences with ''V'' are also very much worth mentioning. It is nice to see how his personal style, motivation and play on words were used to create this effect, and, very important, without looking overly dramatic.<br/><br/>I can honestly say even the way ''V'' and Evey felt about each other at the end of the film, left me with a bit of a chill and somewhat teary eyes. Although it was very clear they could never be together it was nice to see ''V'' had learned about the importance of hope and love in his quest for vengeance.<br/><br/>Therefore, I can only highly recommend this film to anyone out there. By an instant it has become one of my all-time favourites and I am sure you will enjoy this film as much as I do.<br/><br/>Tata, Miss V ^^"
"lavanyadmurthy","10","8","15","20 June 2006"," Excellent Dialoges
","The movie captured my imagination.Excellent movie! Worth every minute of your time. The dialogs grab your attention, especially from the character V. Hugo Weaving has given an Oscar-worthy performance, even with a mask on. Natalie Portman is stunning as ever, and has given an equally excellent performance. The movie without being too big on action scenes, delivers the idea of action very well. I especially loved the first set of dialogs between V and Eve, when every word V speaks begins with the letter 'V'. Hugo Weaving creates this mysterious, strong, and yet, sensitive personality in an unparalleled way. Excellent casting, cinematography and amazing sets. Amazing! Overall, an excellent watch. I know this movie is going in to my movie collection."
"geekerella","10","8","15","28 May 2006"," Shockingly Good
","I hadn't intended to see this film but it was on at the IMAX and I had a free evening so I figured I'd take a look see. After all a comic book film would have effects and those would look amazing on a giant screen, thus compensating for all the shortcomings that comic book films so often have.<br/><br/>WOW!!!! It was a film chock-full of ideas, many of which are still fermenting in my head. It was about the indomitable human spirit. It was about the integrity of each individual. It was about a vendetta. It was about love of self, love of society (a much-abused concept), love of an individual, love of ideas, love of art, love of books, love of words, love of your fellow man. By the end I was almost hyperventilating at the power of the images and the ideas and the possibilities.<br/><br/>What didn't I like? Well, I wouldn't have cast Natalie Portman. She was too California skinny and her accent was appalling. I'd have got an actress with a healthier English build and the ability to hold an English accent. Having said that, she didn't let the film down or make it unwatchable. The cast, directors and production team were so good that they were able to carry her easily.<br/><br/>Please see this film. It may shock you but it will also make you think."
"kyrat","8","8","15","14 April 2006"," A Call To Action: See it now and stop our world from becoming like that.
","The story is classic. It has parallels to Hitler, the USSR, Thatcher/Reagan and now Bush/Blair. I know the graphic novel was written in response to Thatcher(& Reagan), but given our current geopolitical climate it seems a perfect time to resurrect this story. <br/><br/>As a fan of the novel, I was prepared for changes and tried not to mind the addition/deletion of subplots and minor changes. I liked how they adapted and updated it to todays issues. As an example- having had to be fingerprinted recently for a promotion (and having the DOJ REFUSE to tell me what happens to my ""criminal history"" record in IAFIS when I leave the job) - I can appreciate what it will be like when we have to use our fingerprints as an ID for everything!<br/><br/>Overall I thought the film stuck to the imagery and the ideas in the book pretty well. A few moments rang false for me (the roaring burning guy image they kept showing only made us laugh at how bad it was). I felt as if we were in ""England as Americans see it"" (even I know more British cuss words than 'Bollocks'! I tried to just see it as a hybrid English/American amalgamation rather than England as it is today.<br/><br/>I wish they had included a few things that I thought were important to the story. I felt they downplayed the xenophobia and racist genocide a bit more than they should have. Also, I thought they made a huge mistake in not portraying the economic depression that also played (and plays in today's world) a part in people's submissiveness to the regime and one of their sources (apart from fear) of power. Especially given our failing economy (at least in America) - I thought this was an important parallel that should have stayed in. Finally, while the undercurrent of love was fine, that last kiss/declaration of love was too cheesy and spoiled the last few minutes and (IMO) threw off the point of the film.<br/><br/>The cast was superb. Even Natalie Portman who I have been ambivalent about as an actor, pulled off her role fairly well. (I appreciated the irony of John Hurt, the hero in the movie version 1984 is now one of the bad guys in a similar reminder of the dangers of fascism). The mise-en-scene was well done. This film actually makes you root for the (symbolic) destruction of a beloved global landmark.<br/><br/>The single biggest failing though was the ADVERTISING/ product placement! There is an extremely overt brand placement of a TV brand and a shorter, less obvious computer brand placement. This insidious advertising especially does not belong in a film in which one of the themes is media control of what people think/do/(buy)and references corporations involvement in politics! These are not struggling producers who couldn't get a film financed without whoring themselves out to consumer interests. (Not to mention-it was anachronistic-how are they getting American computers if the US is in civil war and it's products are blockaded from Britain??) For shame. I deducted stars for that! I know product placement is being used in more and more films, but I do not appreciate it."
"angelicfury","10","8","15","10 April 2006"," Prognosticates the future of freedom...
","I went into the theatre to watch this movie expecting an action flick of the likes of the matrix. However, V for Vendetta more than surprised me with its direct comment on the politics of dictatorship, censorship and intellectual slavery.<br/><br/>The movie is a comment on the growing shackles that governments the world over are imposing on their citizens. I personally believe that we are less free than we were about 10-15 years ago. The events that have shaped the past decade have allowed governments to justify intense curbs on freedom the world over in reality.<br/><br/>Although the movie might not appeal to your average person who doesn't pay much attention to what is going on in the world, it does present a dramatic (though a little overstated) history of the near future in which the government takes over private liberty in the name of security. It also makes a subtle comment on how propaganda is used as a weapon, though the movie doesn't fully recognize its potential.<br/><br/>Vendetta goes on to show that the power of a thought, sparked off by a single person is enough to return freedom to a nation.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie presents a message to the people who see it, a message that we are being fettered each day with greater curbs. A message that we need to awake to the way the world is being shaped at this very moment and respond before it is too late.<br/><br/>Quite inspiring....."
"ratm_titans","10","8","15","8 April 2006"," V is the greatest
","I think V for Vendetta is a truly great film. It is one of the best films to be released in the last 2-3 years. The plot is different, makes people think and provides good plot, characters and action. Altho bits from the comic, I feel, could have been introduced into the film. Like Dominics transformation to the new role of V leading the people of London. Perhaps they felt they should not corrupt the film with a sequel, I know that Alan Moore the original writer was unimpressed with the film project and left, so perhaps it was in kindness to him. I think it is ignorant to pick up the small things in the film that are perhaps wrong. I see people writing about how people in the UK never say elevator, course they do, just because you don't say it. Hugo Weaving as the lead role does seem to suit him, his voice is superb, but still it would be interesting to see how James Purefoys voice would have sounded behind the mask. Natalie Portmans acting was also very good, I can see where people are coming from on her accent but she still did a good job, portraying emotions. Just my thoughts!"
"Xyghaar","10","8","15","8 April 2006"," Amazing
","There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said already. The acting is unbelievable, the characters and their dialogue are brilliantly written, the plot is deep and thought-provoking without being confusing, and the special effects are jaw-dropping without being oppressive. The best effects in the entire move are actually the ones that required no computer animation or modern technology; fans of classic movies will notice such devices as low-key music, camera angles, and background noise fading into silence all being used masterfully. I saw this movie on a Friday night, opening weekend, in a cinema packed with over 300 other people. Not one person moved or talked for the last 30 minutes of the film; we all sat in stupefied silence, utterly spellbound by this powerful movie.<br/><br/>Ironically, one of the major theme of this movie is that intelligence is perhaps the strongest weapon in the world. This is ironic because all of the people frantically blaming this movie for religious or political reasons are the ones that misinterpreted it. My advice to anyone that has not seen it is to go do so right now, but leave personal prejudices outside the cinema and enjoy an experience that is as poignant as it is absolutely mind-blowing.<br/><br/>Oh, this is off-topic, but I thought someone might want to know that the IMDb spellchecker will try and ""correct"" several words even if they are spelled correctly."

In fact, even though he has been picturised behind a mask, you can almost see the expressions writ on his face behind the mask.<br/><br/>A well made movie with well thought about and well delivered dialogues.

","****SPOILERS**** Futuristic drama set in 2020 Great Britian about a totalitarian government being confronted by a dark clothed freedom fighter determined to bring it down that it ends up costing him his life. Planing to make himself and intentions known to the British people on midnight November 5, V, Hugo Weaving, first rescues young British national TV employee Evey, Natalie Portman, from two government security men who are about to have her arrested for being outside on the street after curfew.<br/><br/>V takes Evey with him onto a London rooftop as the Old Baily Building in London is blown to pieces by explosives that he planted there to the music of Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture. That results in the British dictator Chancellor Adam Sutler,John Hurt, having a fit ordering his entire army of security, as well as the British military, to find who ever did it and then bring him to justice; Which is a kangaroo trial conducted by the state without a jury.<br/><br/>The next day V breaks into the government controlled TV studio in London and after dispatching a squad of security men goes on the air telling the Britsh people that he'll be at war with Sutler's regime with the final reckoning coming next November 5 ""Guy Fawkes Day"". It's then when he'll destroy the British Parliament Building that Fawkes attempted, but failed, to do back in 1605.<br/><br/>The movie ""V for Vendetta"" mirrors what's happening now in the world with terrorism as the weapon of choice by the likes of Osama Bin-Ladin & Co. and has V using these same hit-and-run tactics against the British Government that he feels has betrayed and enslaved the British people. Enormously successful in his battle against the Sutler regime V nevertheless is a one man army with no one, but Evey, joining him in his fight. Which makes him a bit more then just a human being but someone with superhuman powers who can take on dozens of opponents and defeat them without as much as breaking into a sweat.<br/><br/>We get to know V's background in a number of flashbacks that indicate that he was the subject of a government experiment that went wrong that left him scared for life. Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and Zorro-like hat V strikes us as someone out of the 18th not 21th century. We also get some idea of how a totalitarian regime like Adam Sutler's took over the government with flashbacks about a deadly biological attack on Britian that resulted in over 100,000 deaths. Were also given the impression that it was the Sutler Regime itself that engineered that attack, making it look like it was the work of Islamic terrorists, in order to get the British people through their representatives in the Parliament to give up their rights and make Sutler a total dictator who answers to no one and to no laws.<br/><br/>As November 5 gets closer by the day It's not V but Chancellor Sutler and his underlings who start to panic as the mysterious masked maestro knocks off key members of his regime including the ""Voice of London"" Lewis Profhero,Roger Allen,who we later find out was the commandant of a brutal government concentration camp where V was later almost killed in a chemical explosion. Using the London tube, or subway, V has a plan to use a train-load of explosives that will go under the Parliament Building at precisely midnight November 5 and blow the place straight to hell but Sutler won't be there. He's deposed by his handlers lead by the secretive behind the scenes Cheedy, Tim Pigoff-Smith, who together with his henchmen ends up confronting V in a battle that the result will be the future course of Britsh, as well as American and world, history.<br/><br/>Thought-provoking film with a really surprise ending, that takes up the movies last fifteen or so minutes, that has you thinking about that famous saying about Freedom & Equality; ""Freedom is not Free and all men are not Equal"". That so perfectly describes the movies sheep-like and ignorant British people in the quotes beginning statement and the courageous and principled masked avenger and freedom fighter V for Vendetta in the quotes end."

","V For Vendetta is based on a graphic novel (comic) by Alan Moore, who was also the creator of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and From Hell. Much like those two films, V for Vendetta has it's roots in British history as V takes his inspiration from possibly the most well known terrorist in our history, Guy Fawkes. Even though his story only plays a very small part in the film, it's actually nice to see such an important piece of our history finally getting a accurate mention in a mainstream Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>The film is written (but not directed) by the Wachowski brothers, who were also responsible for the grandiose mish mash that was the Matrix Trilogy and much like those films, V For Vendetta is a film that's made to make you think, question and discuss. Some may argue (as my wife did) that it glorifies terrorism and maybe it does, but I guess that's all in the interpretation.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around a man consumed by Vengeance, a man with a tortured past, that is driven to fight for his and his people's freedom in a fascist country, where the government determines what you think and feel. His ultimate goal is to unite the people under his banner, destroy the government and ultimately to blow up the Houses Of Parliament, much like Guy Fawkes had attempted to do all those years ago.<br/><br/>Although the plot is well constructed and some of the performances are exceptional the movie does have it's failings. It's leading lady (Natalie Portman) seems bizarrely miscast as a an English girl that V saves, enlightens and eventually falls in love with. Even though she does excellent work in the second half of the movie, the first half leaves a lot to be desired. There is also a distinct lack of emotional connection with her, something that would have helped drive home the themes and ideas that run through the movie. <br/><br/>Fortunately though, V (Hugo Weaving) is simply fantastic, proving that even a man wearing a mask can display a multitude of emotion. I'm led to believe that he wasn't first choice for the role and even as great as he is here, I can see why. The biggest problem with casting Hugo is the sound of his voice or rather it's because that voice is so reminiscent of his most iconic character to date, Agent Smith. However, if you can push that thought to the back of your mind, you will enjoy his performance immensely. The supporting cast also do good work here, especially Stephen Fry, John Hurt and Tim Piggot-Smith.<br/><br/>Although the film deals with very serious issues there are some enjoyable moments of humour, especially one involving Stephen Fry and Benny Hill. The action is also well executed and the special effects while mostly minimal are also applied perfectly. Overall, it probably deserves to be seen on the big screen, especially for the final scenes and if you like films that make you think, this is definitely for you.<br/><br/>Almost great, definitely good."

","It seems that quite a few people don't like this film. Most dissenting voices appear to be not overly concerned with the quality of storytelling, visuals, dialogue, acting etc, for all excel, but rather with the broader concept - the rights or wrongs of sedition, the questions raised by the totalitarian state of the film, the eternal left/wing continuum...<br/><br/>Well they're entitled to their opinions of course, but it appears that this film has caught a mood, and that something very slowly is happening out there. I've rarely seen public opinion so galvanised by a politically-motivated film, and I've personally never been so affected by a film in my life.<br/><br/>To leave a movie theatre open-mouthed in astonishment, one's brain whirring at a million miles per hour, is an all-to-rare occurrence in life. Yet it happened after watching V For Vendetta. But why? The fight scenes, though cool and crisp, are relatively brief, and I'm not really one to get off on fight scenes much anyway. If that's all I want, I'll watch Bad Boys II. The explosion scenes, equally, are executed with amazing aplomb, but the film would barely register a loss if the climactic explosion didn't occur. The primary message of V is that ideas are paramount, ideas count above all else and ideas will lead us to freedom. And it is the idea of the film that cuts so deeply.<br/><br/>I have never been so affected by a film, to the extent of contemplating leaving my lucrative but pointless job after watching it... I would welcome every single individual in the UK watching this with an open mind. If it's not your thing, fine. If you find the action not mindless enough for your taste, again fine - most of Hollywood's other product will cater for you.<br/><br/>But if you feel, as I feel, that something's not quite right with how our countries are ruled, then see this film, and get a glimpse of what might lie in store."

But to my surprise I was shocked seeing the the Masked Anarchist (Hugo Weaving). The way he talked, quotes Shakespeare in his normal conversation and the scene where he uses most of the words only starting with V impressed me. Though I was not fond of the antagonist ( The Chancellor) there could have been some improvement in his way of dealing the method instead of just shouting in a video conference there could have been a much intelligent and smarter Chancellor who could give the Masked Anarchist a little bit more difficulty to obtain his goal. Overall just the character of the Masked Anarchist impressed me especially where he keeps the young woman (Natalie Portman) in a fake prison and still makes her believe that her going into the fake prison was a good thing even though it was completely staged and changed her. The fact that it was also able to fool the audience would have been must dramatic but as the Fascist government were not torturing her, and the character who was interrogating her face was not shown so I had already figured out before. (this is something very well portrayed in the TV series Mr.Robot). Overall I loved this movie just 9/10, 1 because of the Fascist chancellor could have been better."

The main government threat is the terrorist that goes by code name V. V's actual name is Hugo Weaving. Hugo had a troubled past with London which is what made him want revenge and become a terrorist.

After Evey and V start to become better friends he brain washes her ,but only to make her a better person and to make her feel ""free."" Ivy starts to feel more comfortable about V's plans against the government; she wants to help out with it. Towards the end of the movie V goes through with his plans and the movies ends with a sad but inspiring close. When comparing the movie to the books they did a overall good job with characterization. The movie does a good job portraying V as a mysterious but witty character and Evy as a innocent girl. In the movie they did leave out a lot parts at some points it felt rushed but which is understandable because it was a movie. One part that was disappointing that they left out was the tricks V played with the computer. I thought that was a very interesting and important part of the book and I was surprised they left it out. The added scenes I thought blended well with the rest of the movie and I was not disappointed. Overall I believe this was a very entertaining and often true to the book movie."

Responsible for some of the finest comic stories I have ever read, including the seminal series Watchmen, Moore has never been treated extremely well in big screen adaptations of his material. The attempts to date have included From Hell and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, neither of which were disasters, but hardly shining examples of great movies. Now, with V for Vendetta, Moore's source material has finally been given the cinematic respect it deserves.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta comes from the Wachowski Brothers of Matrix fame, although this time they are just writers-producers, turning over directorial reins to their longtime First Assistant Director James McTeigue, who makes his feature debut with V for Vendetta. Those expecting anything in the Matrix vein will be disappointed, because this is not a film about kung fu fighting and virtual worlds, it is a film about ideas and principals, with some controversial material at it's heart.<br/><br/>The film opens in 2019 London, where the world has changed. America is a cesspool of disease and England has become a totalitarian state under the iron-fisted rule of Supreme Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt). He runs a ruthless propaganda machine that provides nightly broadcasts from a media mouthpiece known as the ""Voice of England"", Lewis Prothero (Roger Allam), telling the nation what to think. Nightly curfews are in place, and it is after the curfew for the evening has gone into effect that British Television Network employee Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) has gone out to meet a friend. She is assaulted by government agents and rescued by a man dressed in a cloak and donning a Guy Fawkes mask, who goes by the name V (Hugo Weaving). V is out to destroy the London landmark the Old Bailey, accompanied by fireworks and the 1812 Overture over the city's loudspeakers.<br/><br/>After V's first act of terrorism, he issues an offer to England's populous: stand with him at the gates of parliament in one year's time to resist the government and take back their freedom. Meanwhile, video camera's that recorded V's first act has singled out Evey, so the police are attempting to find her, and V takes her into his protective custody, but she is uncertain if V is a terrorist or a freedom fighter. V is also in the process of murdering several key member's of England's ruling party, putting police detective Finch (Stephen Rea) on his tail, but he quickly begins to discover more than he bargained for.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta has at it's center a question that is arguably of more relevance today than when the original multi-issue mini-series was published in the 1980's: is terrorism always unjustified? Or is it sometimes a label used by those in power to stop the efforts of those attempting to undermine an oppressive regime. While the film is set in England, the issues at V for Vendetta's core are very relevant to Americans, going as far back as the American Revolution, and the events of 9/11 can't be ignored for recent volleys for this issue.<br/><br/>While not an action film per se, V for Vendetta has a few decent action set pieces that are well staged, but they are not the film's thrust. V integrates material as diverse as Hitler's Nazi regime, featuring swastika like symbols, jack boots, intolerance of racial, and sexual, differences; the infamous George Orwell novel 1984, with it's relentless pro-state propaganda and large images of the head of it's leader consuming television screens; and finally, film noir detective stories. It is this last aspect that doesn't really work well. At times the film's scenes involving the investigation of the murder of prominent members of the society is almost the central focus, but are quickly ushered off and the connection to the remainder of the plot seems at time tenuous; you know it's important, but the screenplay doesn't quite weave the material into the other aspects of the film's story.<br/><br/>The film's performances are mostly adequate, but there isn't really a standout. Natalie Portman, top billed, fills the role of Evey well, but is just good enough, not outstanding. The most memorable performance is actually Hugo Weaving's vocal work as V. The character never appears without his mask, so we never get a view of his face. The role was originally filled by British thespian James Purefoy, but he left over ""creative differences"" and Weaving took over the role, and since the actor's face is never seen, what remains on screen physically is a mixture of Purefoy, Weaving and a stuntman. However, the voice is all Weaving, and he deliver's V's often colorful lines effectively, making an impression without having to even view his countenance.<br/><br/>Overall, V for Vendetta is an entertaining and often thought-provoking experience, almost sure to cause debate in some corners, and rightfully so. The issues it raises are not easy ones, and many will undoubtedly be offended by some of the film's material. But, without debate, there is no greater understanding, and V for Vendetta entertains while engaging. What a fresh breath of aid that can be."

","A standard has been set for those of us who live in a society of fear. ""V for Vendetta"" was clearly made as a slap in our face- something to wake us up from our lazy fat slumber; a shot of adrenaline against the narcotic filth that our society fills us with every day.<br/><br/>Many themes run through this movie, many borrowed from works we've already at least heard of. Vengeance, courage, truth, true freedom. Though the themes are not original, and even some of the movie is reminiscent of some classic works, the presentation is fantastically original and new.

"renofhate","10","4","6","20 February 2018"," An intriguing and comprehensive film offering a lot of insight; fuelled by thought-provoking ambiguity and wonder
","As far as I'm concerned, this is one of the greatest films ever made, despite being relatively unknown in comparison with other films of the genre; whether you see it as a film of its own or a film loosely based off DC comics, there's no denying it's a truly remarkable work of art brought to the big screen (again, from whether or not the perspective is standalone or based).<br/><br/>Packed full of exquisite dialogue and fantastic, well-written performances, it's clear and simple as to why it's in my top five. The plot is superbly written and has a lot of depth to it. If you're a fan of ambiguous movies, this one counts. I mean, to me there's a lot of ambiguity involved, but not just in terms of personal opinion, but rather I mean there genuinely is a lot of unanswered stuff. Tremendous as it is, I still don't know whether or not this is my favorite Hugo Weaving role. I loved his role as Agent Smith too, from The Matrix. Actually, no. As much as I adore and love The Matrix, this is the pinnacle mark right here. This is his defining role if you ask me. The saddening thing is that V does, in fact, die at the end... but the day he sought all along doesn't die. It merely even starts. It's just the beginning.... <br/><br/>The fact of the matter is this - no face, no worries. You don't even get to see his face once in the film (unless the Rockwood scene counts, but it really doesn't), and it matters not one bit. The voice and the movement are enough. A genius portrayal indeed.<br/><br/>All side and co-characters are phenomenal in their respective roles. As it is a joint-character film, the other lead is (as most people will know), Natalie Portman - she is very good in the film, and does a terrific job; and this too is perhaps her defining performance... <br/><br/>
A marvellous film."
"Mrbrown43","8","4","6","13 December 2017"," V for Vendetta: Remembering the 5th of November
","V for Vendetta (2006) is a dystopian political thriller directed by James McTeigue and written by The Wachowskis. It stars Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving and John Hurt and is an adaptation of the Alan Moore graphic novel of the same name.<br/><br/>The Year is 2027, the world has been rocked by war and plague, the US is a shell of its former self in the middle of civil war and England is ruled by a Fascist party known as Norsefire. England is a police state and the one part government controls all aspects of the common people's lives. Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) is on her way for to a date, it is past Government curfew and as a result she runs into the secret state police (Fingermen) and is about to be raped by them she is rescued by a masked vigilante called V. There she slowly gets involved in helping V overthrow the Norsefire party and free England from oppression. <br/><br/>The world V for Vendetta is in has been brought to life extremely well; it is able to make the idea of England under dictatorship believable and a scary possible future. The film is dripping in visual story telling that is able to trust that the viewer is smart enough to not demand to get spoon fed but is not too obscure either. The main themes of Justice and freedom of expression are woven into the narrative with skill and subtly that helps make the film universal and timeless. I find the use of the Guy Fawkes mask e being used in protesting censorship an example of how well this film and the book have aged. <br/><br/>It is very strange seeing John Hurt as the dictator after he played Winston in the 1984 film but it is a testament to his ability as an actor that he is able to shake that off, he commands the film whenever he is on, he is horrifying as High Chancellor Adam Sutler. We do not even see him that much asides from a screen that looms over the other members of the Norsefire party. I cannot see anyone else playing Sutler. Hugo Weaving takes a task that most actors even most studios would not risk. He never shows his face to any one for the entire film, not many actors are willing to do that and it would have been force in a scene with V taking off the mask and it would damage one of the themes of the film being that V is a symbol rather than a person that can die. That being said Hugo Weaving is great in this, he is not only a tragic figure forced to become terrorist in the hope of making the world a better place but is also a killer and a terrorist who destroys property. V is an interesting character study of when people are forced to commit terrible acts for the greater good of a country. Natalie Portman's English accent is fine, it does the job and I believe that she is English despite some slips in her voice. Her performance is also well done and she is a well written character. <br/><br/>I cannot really think of anything wrong with this film. The sympathetic view of V might be problematic as it could be seen as sympathetic to terrorists but it is unlikely and is an analysis for another day."

","Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, 'V for Vendetta' is a political thriller set in a fascist-ruled England in the 2020s. A film that delves into the political side of oppression and anarchy, whilst running a somewhat emotive and heartfelt story of a character in betrayal, 'V for Vendetta' is a visually stunning and extremely smart flick with some fantastic performances from Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman (whose English accent is rather impressive). The film is nowadays considered a cult classic, and rightfully so, even to the extent that the film has been utilised by governments as an allegory of oppression.<br/><br/>I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com.

I know Alan Moore hated it, I think he even tried to get it banned or something, but to me Hugo's performance is beyond incredible. The general fear of a main character behind a mask with no facial expression's is totally beyond comparison here. Hugo, if you're reading this, you have reached Ian McKellen status in my eyes.<br/><br/>It's really difficult to imagine this comic being put onto the big screen and more so, being acceptable, yet I found it truly compelling, inspiring and the overall essence captured.

"ironhorse_iv","9","4","6","5 November 2015"," Remember! Remember! The 5th of November! While, V for Vendetta; V also stands out for victorious! What a great watch!
","People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people. Indeed, V for Vendetta directed by James McTeigue kinda shows that. Based on the comic book by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. This controversy movie tells the story of shadowy freedom fighter, only known by the alias of ""V"" (Hugo Weaving) trying to commit terrorist attacks against the fascist government of Britain with the help of an young woman, named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman). Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I love the obvious symbolism, in which; this movie is trying to say. Indeed, the idea of self-expression is hard to kill. This is a physical representation of one of V's guiding principles. While, Hugo Weaving is indeed playing as 'V', you never once, see his face, just his voice. This is very important for the film to do, because the purpose of the mask was for it, to be the symbol of opposition and revolt against the ruling class. I think, this idea somewhat works. Even though that was never Moore's intent, to have Guy Fawkes masks, feature in the comics. The mask model after Guy Fawkes, a 17th century man known for attempting to blow up the British Parliament, has become, so much more, outside from the media, in which it came from. It became the symbol of free-will. The mask has become so popular, that it also began to represent the new world of 21th century social activism. Like V in the film, Guy Fawkes, seem like a folk-tale hero to uninformed. However, in reality, both characters 'heroic' status is highly dubious. First off, I wouldn't call, the real-life, Guy Fawkes, a hero. After all, the Gunpowder Plot wasn't really to strike a blow for freedom, they simply wanted to replace the Protestant king with a Catholic one. Further, more, they packed in so much gunpowder that hundreds, possibly thousands of innocent civilians would have been killed. So thank goodness that it failed. Lastly, Guy Fawkes wasn't even a core member of the conspiracy, but a minor mercenary, who didn't do a good job, hiding the gunpower. To most historian, he was more idiotic, than a genius. Anyways, the reason why the British celebrate, Guy Fawkes Night, isn't because how heroic, he was. The true reason, they celebrate it, is because he fail, allowing Protestant to continue to rule the masses, there. By modern standards, both V & Guy Fawkes are depraved terrorists, nothing less. So for the film to present V as more of a good guy and fascism leader, Adam Sulter (John Hurt) as 100% evil. It resulted in a more black and white viewpoint than the more complex side from the comic book, in which you don't know, for sure, who is the good guys. While, Norsefire in the comics, were still a repressive dictatorship. At least, the characters within it, was a little more complex, than the disappointing clear-cut villains, we have here. In many ways, I wish the movie was like, the comic, with its biblical theme. The villain, Adam Susan AKA Sulter, in the comics, represented how society need to stick to its notion of purity. His solipsist belief that he control fate, is similar to that of Adam from Genesis. He genuinely believes that self-choice is dangerous & that V represented the devil. The choice to not obey, but live life as your own. Evey represented Eve, the woman who is tempted to exposed, the unfair judgements and discriminatory racial and sexual stereotypes in which, the power, make be, has on people. It's no wonder, why V target the three symbols of authority: the government, the church and education institution. It makes more sense. I like the complexity that the comic, had. You truly, don't know, if V was the good guy, bad guy or just mad. It's so unlike the movie, that makes you really want to cheer for anarchists, even after the sick psychological and physical torturing, they do, against each other. I love, how V in the comics, has more moral ambiguity. Still, I can understand, why the film wanted to make V, more sympathetic than its comic book version. After all, we have to agree for the cause, in which, he fighting for, or we wouldn't have a movie. Weaving does a likable job, here. His charisma shows through his speech patterns, his philosophy, his dry sense of humor, and his flair for dramatics. All these qualities make V, watchable. One thing, that I thought, the movie does better, than the comic, was not to make him, seem like a superhero with peak-human abilities. The movie stay away from the superman drugs. No mention of LSD or Batch 5 really help the script. That's one thing, I didn't like, from the comic. However, the Matrix-like action scenes and slow-motion domino scenes, were a bit over-the top, pretentious fillers. One thing, that I felt the movie does really well, is show, the duality between V and Evey. V was created by fire, signifying destruction. While, there is Evey who is reborn by water, signifying creation. It shows that Anarchy wear two faces- both creator and destroyer. I have to say, Natalie Portman was outstanding in her role. I didn't mind, the little changes, they did, for the character. Still, V for Vendetta was a bit heavy-handed, when it comes to Evey's transformation from simpleton to cult leader. It's seem like an easy choice for her, here, than in the comics. Overall: In my opinion, the original comic will always be better, because it was influenced by Alan Moore's fears of Thatcherite Britain becoming a repressive dictatorship. While, the film version owes more to critics of the second Bush administration and its clear filmic references to human rights abuses by the US, emphasis on terrorism and Islamophobia. Still, whatever, version, you get into. Both serve, its purpose: being thought-provoking. It's a must-have."
"matthewjones1997","6","4","6","1 February 2015"," Good film, but not worthy of its high ratings
","V for Vendetta stands for something which, in certain areas of the world is a common stand point, freedom. Also, V's character is based hugely on Guy Fawkes, and his quest for 'freedom'. However the sole purpose of the gun powder plot was to create chaos among the English population in an attempt to restore Catholic rule over Britain. This is a major factual error, a film which grossed so much and is rated so highly, it seems absurd that the writers would make such a stupid mistake. This lowers the rating of the film, personally, as a film being based on historical events, it should at least get those events right.<br/><br/>Secondly, it is not the most gripping of story lines. Whilst V is a good character, his portrayal is not outstanding. Hugo Weaving who has been in a number of highly rated movies and has proved himself to be of reasonable (to good) acting ability simply gave nothing more than what the script asked of him. It is a given, that when making a film whilst aiming for it to be the best, everyone involved will understand that the chances of achieving this are slim, but still. If you think of the greatest character portrayals, the actor has put their own stand on it, through their own additions. For example, Brando's portrayal of Vito Coreleone, he chose to have the jaw brace to try and look like a bull dog and also the infamous scene of him in his office holding a cat; Heath Ledger as the joker, getting Bale to hit him for real, designing his own make up, giving the Joker little psychotic ticks... De Niro as Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver) etc etc. Obviously, people involved with the film did not know how successful the film would be but, if you truly aiming for the film to be as good as possible, it seems nonsensical for you to not make the character your own.<br/><br/>All in all, a reasonable film, with a relatively decent cast, but with very mediocre acting."
"AlsExGal","8","4","6","5 May 2013"," Ahead of its time, but set in the wrong country IMHO
","The idea of a terrorist as a popular hero, the irony of John Hurt who played Winston in ""1984"" playing the dictator, and the further irony of Stephen Rea who played a terrorist in ""The Crying Game"" playing the relentless cop who is now hunting a terrorist for the totalitarian regime were all braver ideas than I am accustomed to seeing coming out of Hollywood in the 21st century.<br/><br/>The acting is commendable. It is good to see Natalie Portman given the chance to take on a more challenging role than she was given in her part in the Star Wars prequels where, along with the rest of the cast, she saw lots of action but had little opportunity to act. Plus, Hugo Weaving had a real challenge to project a personality behind the Halloween mask he wore throughout the film with mere body language and the inflection of his voice. I think it was a challenge that he met admirably.<br/><br/>I guess the one thing that really bothered me was the basic premise of the film. Having just read ""While Europe Slept"" I find it difficult to believe that the United States would end up self destructing by ever managing to be more politically correct than any country in Europe, including Great Britain. I also find it hard to believe that religious fundamentalism would ever take root in England, since its language and ways would seem foreign to almost the entire citizenry. After all, the entire continent of Europe has been in a post-Christian era for about the last one hundred years. Nobody in Europe would even understand what the dictator was talking about when he delivered one of his religious rants - he might as well be reciting Shakespeare backwards.<br/><br/>Instead, this film looks more and more like a futuristic vision of the U.S., and not even that futuristic. I can easily see a theocratic fascist regime set up in the United States, citizens hassled endlessly by security forces over minor infractions of countless rules, and Americans just sitting back and taking it. Europeans would be more likely to protest under these circumstances than Americans, in particular if you could convince large numbers of them that it was ""God's will"" or it was for the sake of ""national security"". Mix Calvinism with an extreme form of nationalism and you've got a recipe for exactly what happens in this film. In the U.S. we have plenty of both."
"phucitol","3","10","20","1 April 2009"," Meh, somewhat entertaining, except...
","I do enjoy films with a message. V certainly has one and it hits you over the head like a sledgehammer. This particularly isn't a problem when executed well, but doing so in a comic bookish fashion with poor acting doesn't make for very entertaining fare. Maybe I was expecting too much from the outset - more eye candy - more ""gee whiz"" from the Wachowski brothers rather then simply a political statement? I suppose if you're an adult whose buried your face in comic books your entire adolescent years you'll find the characters spectacular no matter how drab. I couldn't help but think this movie was a direct rip-off of ""The Man in the Iron Mask (1939)"" and ""The Three Musketeers"", of course minus two swashbucklers in this film. At one point my ""stop button"" finger was getting rather itchy when I was pelted over the head with a pro-lesbianism/homosexuality propaganda segment. Call me a prude, but it was WAY too obvious and entirely unnecessary in the weak story this was supposed to be telling.<br/><br/>I'd avoid this one if you're expecting sci-fi along the lines and caliber of The Matrix. It doesn't even outshine one of the sequels and those were fairly poor in themselves. You have been warned. Face it Wachowski brothers, your best is in the past."

","Complete joke. If people would read more they would know that this was a bastardized, modernized, canonized version of a great work by the finest author of graphic novels of the last twenty-five years (sorry Frank Miller).<br/><br/>All the layered stories and symbolism that made the book such a joy have been removed and turned into a more cookie-cutter, user-friendly action flick that promoted stylized violence over stylized plot. That is it's biggest fault. Characters thrown around and placed wherever for whatever reason (evey never even meets Gordon until halfway through the book).<br/><br/>V was not a freedom fighter, he openly admits in the book that he has turned from that brand of justice, and is in fact, an anarchist.

It goes on and on.<br/><br/>And the stuff that wasn't in the book, the count of monte cristo? An SNL type show where the audience is held at gunpoint? Where the he11 did this come from? It neither helped the ideals nor had the amount of symbolism that Moore included is his original. And when it comes to Moore, don't mess with perfection.<br/><br/>Avoiding the political slant, in which this was obviously and shamelessly pointed toward current events, the book was anarchy-vs-totalitarianism. This was material that was dated, but the screen writers saw a story that at it's bone was man vs gov't and decided they could twist a story that in all reality has nothing to do with current events and keep alive a spirit that was never there to begin with.<br/><br/>Exploited violence with a paper thin plot so overdone over the years it's a surprise it hasn't torn yet.

The similarities are staggering, however, we do not accept the actions of Iraqis because they are not ""film-friendly"" and are not fully understood by Western culture.

","This movie is based on the fact that governments create fear in people to control them and spend billions on weapons and the military.

A lot of oppressive regimes act this way around the world and in each of these countries there are freedom fighters or terrorists depending on which side you are on.<br/><br/>The movie also communicates that the purpose of taking actions against the oppressors is not just revenge but that each action is a strategy to make the oppressive regime collapse. Each of V's actions creates a pre-calculated reaction which climaxes with the end sequence of the movie.<br/><br/>Excellent work and truly emotional. The controversy will be that violence was used by V to end the oppressive regime instead of the non-violent ways of Gandhi and MLK.<br/><br/>Clearly the message of the movie could be taken one step further: The analogy being the US committing state terror against other countries and that the oppressed people will fight back. The media control is certainly well documented by Noam Chomsky in ""Manufacturing Consent""."

","This film was entertaining, but it was also agonizing because it was so much worse than it could have been. If you're willing to turn off your mind, perhaps you won't be bothered by the preaching about totalitarian governments. Or the fact that the script feels like it was authored by a committee of writers, each one wanting to add their own elements that pull this movie in about fifteen different directions with no cohesive core other than politically motivated violence. This movie tries to be way too much, and in doing so it is simply not plausible. I can imagine how the scriptwriting went: -- ""Hey! Let's go off on a tangent about lesbians."" ""Great idea!"" (High-fives are exchanged.) ""Let's talk about viruses for awhile."" ""Yeah! And what if our masked hero is great at cooking toast and eggs with real butter. Let's show that several times!"" ""Excellent!"" ----- You get the idea. It was like Zorro (with 'V' instead of 'Z') meets Batman Begins, with some not-so-subtle political undertones, lots of shouting, and a script that wastes the talents of Natalie Portman. And despite all the heavy-handed symbolism and shouting, you're left wondering what the point was. This film just doesn't sit well with me. I wouldn't recommend it except to people who are easily amused by typical cinematic trash. You know who you are. Or people who just love hearing the word ""bollocks""."

That said, the ending is the best part of an otherwise forgettable fiasco. A large chunk of the script is given over to an anarchist wearing a Fawkes mask, who singlehandedly plans the destruction of the high tech government of a totalitarian, manipulative, surveillance ridden, future UK. Another chunk of script is given to his pursuer, a policeman played unconvincingly by Stephen Rea. One plot point involves a renegade TV host departing from script to lampoon the totalitarian government - we are expected to believe that such a hi-tech 'eyes and ears' government would wait until after the show had aired in it's entirety before taking action against the TV host.

","Gone is the comic's oppressive atmosphere- the film's Britain doesn't even seem to have spy cameras, while the comic seems to choke you on all sides. Gone are the social interactions between the main government agents that show corruption on the inside. Gone is the rising narrative tension as V's attacks pace along with the story, building up over time. The central villain of the story, initially, seems less like an oppressive government and more like a super-powered Fox News. Gone is the vicious cabaret. Gone is any mention of anarchy. This is a Kinder, Gentler V, and he fights a Kinder, Gentler Totalitarian Britain.<br/><br/>I was honestly surprised that the movie even dealt with Evey's imprisonment the same way that the comic did, by the time it got there. I was prepared for it to totally ruin her character's most important moment and take the last bits of V with it.<br/><br/>Politically, the story and atmosphere are loaded down with unsubtle knocks at the current American administration. This is not to say that such a message shouldn't be expressed- but it's not supposed to be ""V for Vendetta""'s message. Here was a chance for a film to go after what should be the real target: A social system that would allow such poor representation and leadership in the first place. I just wonder why the filmmakers wanted to use ten-dollar cuss words all the way up to an R rating without bothering to give being actually subversive a try, given their source material. ""Ideas are bulletproof,"" to be sure, but where are they?<br/><br/>Good acting and costuming, but otherwise a pretty sloppy film, and entirely unlike the original comic."

","Can a man change anything? Can a man change the government? Can a man change the world? I don't think so. How about an idea? Is an idea so powerful that if taken by a person, can be used to topple governments and change our world, hopefully for the better? That's the question that V for Vendetta proposes, and not only does it present the question, it answers it, and paints a picture so vividly and frightening, unlike anything you have ever seen before. Hugo Weaving plays V, an enigmatic man who wears a mask of Guy Fawkes, who we see saving Evey Hammond from some corrupt policemen who mean to rape her. Soon after, we learn that he's a freedom fighter against the fascist government of a future London, by blowing up a building across the way. What soon follows is nothing short of breathtaking, as we view Evey's transformation from scared citizen, to fearless fighter.<br/><br/>It's this transformation that personifies the same transformation that the people of England take, and shows the idea that V is presenting. Portman plays Evey, from a scared girl who fears what her government will do to her, to a fearless woman who will fight back and be heard. Hugo Weaving, who's face we never see, builds V into a three dimensional character by just using his voice, spouting Shakespeare and his lines effortlessly. It's a sight to behold and very cool.<br/><br/>Yet, soon after Evey meets V, and is charmed by his Shakespeare, the movie shows his ruthlessness and we soon ask another question, Is V right? Is blowing up a building going to change anything? Is V just a terrorist? That's up to you to decide, and while the movie does tell V's story and his motives, it's up to you to determine whether or not he's right. This reviewer has his answer.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a brilliant movie. There's so much underneath the surface for the viewer willing to decipher, and is a movie that makes you think. It's a shame that this movie will be viewed as a political statement and an attack on our administration, and not viewed for what it really is. A message about the people. About what we as a people should do if we're lied to. What we as a people should do if our freedoms are taken from us. V isn't a man, he's an idea. And a brilliant one at that."

","Dramatically, it's a little flawed, but I'd blame that on its considerable thematic weight. It's a courageous, fascinating movie that questions and attacks US and ""Coalition of The Willing"" fear-mongering in the pre- and post-9/11 era. In an effort to not-so-subtly mask its primary target, its setting is post-Thatcher Britain where Big Brother, John Hurt, fans the flames of fear and spews bald-faced lies on giant TV screens to a zombified populace totally reliant on mainstream media for its ""truth"" and moral compass.<br/><br/>""V"" (Hugo Weaving), which stands for both Victim and Vendetta, initiates a series of incendiary subversive acts he hopes will destabilize the government and cause it to fear its people rather than the other way around. Natalie Portman, in an important but not always crucial role, plays Esmeralda to V's Phantom and undergoes an interesting transformation that locks itself into V's dramatic journey.<br/><br/>The pacing is sluggish in places and the exposition is thick, but ""V For Vendetta"" is a work of ideas and outrage, and it wears its heart sincerely on its sleeve. It addresses issues not only as topical as terrorism and government deception, but it also shakes up subjects as diverse as sexual intolerance, secret prisons, the media's snug relationship with the ruling party, and the purpose of violent rebellion.<br/><br/>That a multi-national such as Time-Warner made and released this movie is, in itself, a sign that we may be emerging from a dark, cloudy period in which basic human rights have been ignored by folks claiming to be championing them with missionary-style zeal.<br/><br/>The action set pieces, which are not numerous, are not staged on a grand scale, but they are exceptionally well directed, smartly edited, and threaded with the blackest of humor. Performances are all excellent, with Stephen Rea and Weaving stand-outs.<br/><br/>The film is funny at times because it's truth is so raw, but the audience I saw it with in a large LA cinema was, for the most part, not laughing.

","People who seem to dislike this movie don't seem to comprehend the political and social conflicts of this time -- or any time, for that matter.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is not a film to be watched linearly, as proved by its rather symbolic ending. The Walchowski Brothers are a controversial pair, with controversial visions and this film epitomizes the inaccuracies of our generation.<br/><br/>The plot centers around a ""uncompromising vision of the future,"" where London has been overtaken by an authoritative, and fascist regime. The people fear those who should be protecting them (the government's purpose is to make their citizens feel secure, after all), and are disallowed the simplest of civil rights.<br/><br/>What the Walchowskis did was bring political hypocrisy to the forefront. Clearly, there are hints of Marxist sentiment scattered throughout the film (violent revolution by the working class; we are all equal in this fight), however this film is also depicting what could go wrong should a nation's leader be given too much power.<br/><br/>I could go on all day about the political implications of this movie, but really it's up to the audience to fragment the various symbolisms taking place. Don't just look at the actors' performances (although, I have to say this is one of Portman's greater achievements and Hugo Weaving's wit and charm were not lost behind his mask) or the hauntingly ominous images (especially those of the Old Bailey and Parliament going up in flames) -- pay attention to the film. Really watch it, and notice the details, because, yes, Alan Moore and David Lloyd WERE trying to say something. And yes, the Walchowski Brothers wrote this script for a reason, and this film was shot and released in this time period FOR A REASON.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, many films in the past decade or so have gone to the dogs. Filmmakers assume if they get a handful of beautiful faces to memorize some lines and deliver some prolific message in some generic fashion that they've made a multi-million dollar box-office hit. Vendetta lives above that, because the message in this case, is worth listening to."

Guy Fawkes was a fanatical Catholic that wanted to blow up Parliament to reinstall a Catholic theocracy. Anyone that feels this is a proper analogy to the UK or USA of today (or tomorrow) is an ill informed idiot. The only regimes that have even approached the government portrayed here have been fascist (Nazi Germany, Iraq, etc.) or communist (USSR, Cambodia, PRC, etc.) not the USA or the UK.

","I don't want to sound like a broken record, but V for Vendetta is absolutely, positively, bar none, my favorite movie ever. There is literally nothing I don't like about it. Straight from casting to plot line, I cannot fault it.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving does an amazing job as the mysterious and charismatic terrorist (or is he a freedom fighter? Or maybe he's a superhero. Goodness me, I can't keep track...) known only as V. Natalie Portman finds a role that, in my estimation, she was born for, playing Evey, the relatively innocent young woman cast as both victim and, oddly, sidekick to the enigmatic V. For the stern dictator Adam Sutler, I cannot think of a single human being who could have done it better than John Hurt. Let's face it: the entire cast nails their roles to perfection.<br/><br/>The storyline is deep, meaningful, and most of all, eerily believable. As I watch it, I cannot help but think ""Dear God, this could be tomorrow."" I can only hope that, should fiction become reality, we get a demented savior such as V to save the day.<br/><br/>Although I adore the whole movie, I confess there are a few scenes which stand out to me as extraordinary. Near the very end of the movie, when the many civilians wearing Guy Fawkes masks are storming parliament, the set-up is awe-inspiring. When Parliament begins to explode, V's music begins to play, and the citizens remove their masks, my breath catches in my throat. It is among my favorite scenes in all of cinema, because it sends such a powerful message: All these people, looking just like terrorists, are crying and concerned underneath their masks. Until they remove their masks, I see them as being exactly like V: perhaps tormented, but confident, certain, determined, rebellious, and spiteful. And then they remove their masks and we see that they are, indeed, human. And such is life: underneath our public personas and masks, we are all but human.<br/><br/>In addition, I find and admire immense power in the scene where V knocks down the dominoes. It ties everything together so smoothly. Think of it: aside from the obvious implication that he has puppeteered the entire movie, there is something so much deeper. ONE domino remains standing, and it is the one domino he gives to Evey: that one last inch of her being. That integrity.<br/><br/>My words feel inadequate to me, so I shall suffice to say that this movie is exceptionally good, and I strongly recommend it to anyone and everyone."

But the thing is, there is no substance to the movie and frankly no substance to those who take on V's attitude against corrupt leaders. He's so victimy in this, and what he puts the girl through is just a glorified brainwashing. This feeling like you are being trapped and want everyone to know that feeling and lash out against those who caused it is stereotypical narcissism. People who like this movie don't know what freedom is. This is a movie for people who are too lazy to understand the government/control paradox and are too angry to go about it in any sort of intelligent manner. These people are just angry and blame ""the President"" or the ""Prime Minister"" for being the source of all their problems when it's that shallow mindedness that got them fooled into the situation they are currently fighting against. This is what happens when people don't wake up to themselves and can't see beyond what they hear in school or see on television. This is a movie for the ignorant rebel, a crybaby with victim written all over him. Fighting against themselves more than ""the cause"" which for them is only a product of their own sickness. So cheer on for V, the deluded idiot who knifes the president in a glorified ejaculation. Step in line, stand up to the cookie cutter, and enjoy an imaginative expression of what goes on in the minds of people who have too much anger, no understanding and rely on the BS they see and here around them to authenticate their moody victim attitude and want a movie that provides the illusion that there is wisdom behind their meaningless life."

But there is one man who has survived some of the past atrocities and is determined to set things right again, his own way. He simply goes by 'V' and his is a grand Vendetta. Whether a viewer likes this movie depends on what they are looking for. My wife didn't care that much for it, but I really enjoyed it. It isn't as stylized as, for example, 'Sin City', but to me has more of a 'Batman' feel to it. You know that what you are seeing is not to be taken literally, and much of it is social commentary on the dangers of government taking over the 'freedoms' of the citizens.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is into her mid 20s now and a serious young actress. This is a good role for her, as Evey Hammond whose mother and father both fell victim to the government. She meets 'V' (Hugo Weaving, Neo's nemesis in the Matrix) near the beginning of the movie, on November 5th, as they listen to a concert of sorts, while they view the Old Bailey being blown up, all orchestrated by 'V'. The movie ends one year later, on November 5th. I like the mask that 'V' wears, reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's 'Joker' face, but this mask never comes off, and appears to be bullet proof. <br/><br/>The cast contains a whole host of fine British actors, including Stephen Rea as Inspector Eric Finch, Stephen Fry as Gordon Deitrich, John Hurt as the evil Chancellor Adam Sutler, and Sinéad Cusack as Delia Surridge. The movie contains much violence, much bloodshed, and has some very dark themes. But it is worth a viewing.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW. As 'V' systematically tracks down and destroys each of the enemies whom he had targeted, and police are looking for Evey, the two of them become companions of sorts. While Evey doesn't approve of all the killing, she begins to sympathize with his cause, and in fact falls in love with him. His final act was to be sending a train loaded with explosives into the Parliament building on November 5th. But as he is dying after the final fight, he walks away and gives Evey the option to pull the lever and start the train. It is, after all, her future world, not his. She does, and the movie ends with a spectacular display. NB - 'V' got his strength and other powers after surviving government virus testing and also a fire, the mask and gloves were partly to cover his disfigurement."

","For those familiar with former political rap-metal collective Rage Against the Machine, then you know that the song ""Killing In The Name"" off of their self-titled 1992 debut is an anthem for those upset with our current state of affairs. More so, ""V for Vendetta"" is a visual manifestation of Rage's innermost fears and rants, and, more accurately, the fears of those in power in our current administration. I'm listening to that song right now as I write this review and it's giving me the creative juices to express myself freely as my fingers reach for the keyboard.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" is more spiritually akin to the liberal fears of the American conservative Right than it is the DC/Vertigo graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd. Moore created ""V for Vendetta"" as a manifestation of his political paranoia over a sure-fire conservative victory in the 1982 General Elections of the United Kingdom. This big-budget adaptation, or, revision, is tailor-made for liberal Hollywood for their fears, doesn't take the courage to out-right condemn the powers-that-be, and instead just mirrors the climate without any kind of addressing whatsoever (reasons to which Moore has sought to disassociate himself from the picture).<br/><br/>Most remember that code-name ""V"" (Hugo Weaving) is a free-whelming anarchist instead of a violent freedom fighter. Weaving is acting his way out from behind a mask of Guy Fawkes - yes! - the same co-conspirator convicted and later executed in the foiled 1605 Gunpowder Plot to blow up both houses of Parliament in an attempt to assassinate King James I of England. Weaving's face is never actually seen, so he has to use his voice and mannerisms to define his character. He's exceptionally skilled with a pair knives, is expertly trained in the martial arts, likes reciting literature and poetry particularly ""Faust,"" and using the letter ""V"" in rhyme form and iambic pentameter. He also has a plan to blow up Parliament, just what his hero was unable to do.<br/><br/>It's 2020 London; in Moore's novel it was 1997 (back in '82, 1997 WAS the future). Years have passed since a viral epidemic killed nearly 100,000 people. The United States is in a state of civil unrest and other political upheaval (geez, the filmmakers, despite their apparent lack of backbone in the political arena, really know how to stress a point of America and Britain's doomed authoritarian futures). And it looks like more war is on the horizon.<br/><br/>The film gets underway when V saves the life of Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from thugs. She's a civilian, a pale, sullen home-body who represents the ignorant Everywoman and is naturally unaware of her government's devious plans to subvert public opinion about a guy in a plastic mask who has it out for those in charge. The powers-that-be is a man who's straight out of a liberal's worst nightmare: a gay-hating, woman-bashing, right-wing Christian Hitler/Mussolini/Bush prototype named Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), Big Brother personified, and is never actually seen in person throughout the film but when he is seen, it is always from behind a video monitor.<br/><br/>V has a plan to blow up Parliament on November 5, to mark the anniversary of Guy Fawkes Day, and sweet-thing Evey is going to bear witness over the next 12 months to the fireworks and celebrations. A cop named Finch, played by Stephen Rea, is on V's trail and as he digs deeper, finds himself questioning his own allegiance to his government. V is determined to live up to his vow to bring down that house. Is V a terrorist? Is he a hero? Has he found a kindred spirit in the newly enlightened Evey? Or, more terrifyingly, has he become the thing he has sworn to defeat?<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" was directed by James McTeigue, a protégé of the Wachowski Brothers, Andy and Larry, who wrote the script and were the directors behind the insanely popular ""The Matrix"" (1999) and its sequels. Those films too had similar plots of revolution and political retribution and heroes who were seemingly superhuman. But while they defied gravity, our V here defies clear-cut classification as some anti-hero archetype.<br/><br/>The Wachowskis shy away the best they can from their works to give protégé McTeigue enough room to shine on his own. His film does have a rich visual style akin to what we saw in the ""Matrix,"" though it lacks the technical skill and wonder of those films. I was able to sit through ""V for Vendetta"" with a pretty open mind about its politics, (lack of) faithfulness to the source material, but something still didn't stick right with me. I don't know, maybe it's just because ""V for Vendetta"" didn't stand up to my expectations as something groundbreaking or in-your-face about our current administration and its diabolical affairs. But that's just me.<br/><br/>What I do like about ""V for Vendetta"" is how it's still able to not represent any kind of clear-cut ideology or philosophy. It's not liberal-leaning nor is it really anti-conservative, despite my political musings. It stands on no moral high ground at all. It just shows us a guy in a Guy Fawkes mask trying to stop some really corrupt government types; V is one that DOES practice what he preaches. The film's ending will surely leave a sour taste in the mouths of many but one thing's for sure: never has the destruction of a famous landmark been a reason for celebrations, nor for sympathy.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I went to see this film not thinking I would like it much. But I really did, more so than the other people I saw it with. The idea it brought to my mind was ""when"". This was an extremely believable plot that really did provoke much thought. The dialogue throughout was superb, and the casting was excellent. I'm not a huge fan of films that use American actors to play Brits or vice versa, but I really can't think of a British Actress who could have played Evey. and Hugo Weaving was spot on with all the accents in the film. Northern England by an American cannot be easy!! What I also enjoyed about the film was the way that everything was laid out like a TV serial of a crime. I felt like I was watching a special drama. Not many films can do that. The danger with a film put in the genre of action is that the writers and producers go overboard with the special effects because that's what the public expects. The specials in 'V' were effective because they were used necessarily. What carried the story was the dialogue, but the film was still action. I thought the finale was excellent and very fitting for the film. Definitely worth a watch."

","I'm going to make this quick and to the point. the dialogue is very jumbled. The writing sucks to be honest because it is so very cheesy at times. Natalie Portman makes me very uncomfortable her acting and role in this film is just awkward. This entire film seems very rushed and overdone. Overdone in the sense that there was so many unnecessary parts that did not add anything to film. Wachowski brothers seemed to be on a quest to convince us of this whole idea when we were right along with them the whole time. I appreciated the idea. I think it's great with the government and control but Natalie Portman with a shaved head and some of the things she did and wore made me cringe in my seat with embarrassment. At one point some people in the theatre started to laugh. But do not let me discourage you. I think it definitely has its moments but i still am left questioning the point of certain scenes, characters, and subplots."
"moutonbear25","8","7","13","25 March 2006"," V for Vonderful
","V FOR VENDETTA Written by Andy Wachowski & Larry Wachowski Directed by James McTeigue<br/><br/>""I wish I wasn't afraid all the time but  I am."" A young lady speaks these words to a man in a mask who has imprisoned her in his home. This time in captivity is the most free she has ever felt. London waits outside these walls, as does her job, her friends and what she calls home. The insides of these walls are lined with art; the room is filled with history, music, colour, life. The mask the man is wearing is a Guy Fawkes mask, in honour of the man who once plotted to blow up the parliament building in London as part of a Catholic plot to overthrow the British government. The man behind the mask, known simply as V, plans to finish what Fawkes started centuries before and blow up parliament in the name of the British people so that they can reclaim the freedoms of life they gave up to their government out of fear years before. While the government and media, naturally controlled by the government, proclaim V a terrorist, V sees himself more as an artist. For V, the artist is one who uses lies to tell the truth while politicians use lies to cover the truth up. The men behind this brave film clearly feel the same as they make a terrorist into a sympathetic protagonist and draw undeniable lines between the ruling British government of V's world and the current political relationship of the United States government and it's people. As writers, the Wachowski brothers choose to highlight fear as the motivating factor in people's lives but go so far as to implicate the government as the major perpetuator of that fear. This is not a fresh accusation but the Wachowski's go boldly further to accuse the government, fictional or otherwise, of not only maintaining a stronghold on it's people through fear but originating that fear to begin with, subsequently forcing the people to abandon the original motivating factor in their lives, love.<br/><br/>The frightened young lady being held captive by V is Evey (Natalie Portman). Director James McTeigue, longtime protégé of the Wachowski's, instantly links Evey and V together in the opening sequence of the film by juxtaposing the two characters getting ready for their evening. They are both fixing themselves in the mirror, putting on boots. They both watch the same television news program and both shut it off at the same obnoxious point in the commentator's monologue. They are both putting on their armour to protect themselves in the night, her from harm, him from human connection, and they both have similar views and ideals. The major difference, she's going out to visit a colleague and he's going out to blow up a building. As Evey, Portman is composed and confident. Throughout the course of the film, her character learns to open eyes that have been closed in fear since she was a small child when she witnessed her parents' abduction by a government task force. With her eyes wide open, she can finally stare fear down and see there is a grander design that she is but a small yet vital part of. Hugo Weaving plays the role of V although it may be more appropriate to say the role of V is voiced by Weaving, as we never see him without his mask. Weaving's delivery is both eloquent and polite making for a poetic and charming terrorist. Together, V and Evey are a delightful couple. McTeigue puts them in very simple and close situations, like sharing a breakfast V prepares for her or cozying up on the couch to watch V's favorite film, ""The Count of Monte Christo"", which Evey enjoys but finds sad as the hero chooses duty over love.<br/><br/>Evey's quest is in all of us and we all must overcome our fear, as must she. Placing the viewer on par with a terrorist and his apprentice is what makes V FOR VENDETTA so poignant and effective. At a critical moment in Evey's journey, which can also be ours, she must give herself over to faith and allow herself to be the person she wants to be. Her future self must choose to leave her present self behind her for the present self is too heavily controlled by her past to do what needs to be done to effectuate change. Explosions will ensue and life will be forever changed. It is the change that we cannot fear for we have sacrificed so much of ourselves to that fear. V FOR VENDETTA is dark and bleak. The citizens need a deep extremism, shown here in a stylized pairing of bombs and fireworks set to Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"", to wake them from their complacency. This is where my fears come into play. I fear that we are far too comfortable, far too afraid, and far too apathetic to respond to the call to overthrow those who impede our growth as individuals and as a species. I fear we believe change will come but that it will just happen without any work on our part at all.<br/><br/>V FOR VENDETTA is playful and cheeky. It is exciting and insightful. It can be very wordy but I like wordy. Ultimately, its very root is fearless and that bravery will energize and invigorate the viewer."

"ingrey","10","9","18","29 March 2006"," Good but could have been better
","Having watched the trailers I was looking forward to this simply because it looked so different to anything I had seen recently. <br/><br/>Ignoring the bad press reviews I determined to see the film and was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The dystopian story, as most people will know, is set predominantly in London during the near-future.<br/><br/>England (Scotland and Wales are not referred to.) is a police state. Of the rest of the world we know little, only that the US has collapsed into Civil War.<br/><br/>The plot centres around a mysterious but enigmatic freedom fighter named only ""V"" (Weaving) and his relationship with Evey Hammond (Portman). V takes Evey under his wing and proceeds to open her eyes to the true state of the world but at the same time she is subjected to his mind games.<br/><br/>The world-weary Inspector Finch (played excellently by Stephen Rea) dominates the sub-plot as he investigates the dark past of the party members that V is theatrically bumping off. In his attempts to find V, Finch is ultimately fumbling his way to a far greater truth, this is, of course, V's intention. <br/><br/>V's actions are civilian friendly but morally ambiguous; he mercilessly kills security men and former workers at a detention centre without remorse. His significance lies in the influence he has on the public, especially Evey and Finch. Both have changed by the end of the film and become ready to embrace a new future. Similarly Londoners, who once were blind or chose to ignore the problems of society gradually become aware of the ""state they are in"".<br/><br/>Weaving is outstanding in his larger-than-life role. Weaving manages to convey incredible emotion for a man constrained to acting a mask. Portman put in a good performance and I was pleased to see she has regained her abilities since seemingly suffering from an acting lobotomy in the Star Wars films. Though her accent is convincing it is clearly false and though it never slips the range of her voice is clipped by the need to maintain it. I also think it is too posh for one that supposedly spent five years in a ""re-education centre"", unless that meant she was sent to a private boarding school.<br/><br/>Rea's understated performance contrasts well with the flamboyant V and is perfect for the role. Also worth mentioning is Tim Piggot-Smith as the unpleasant Mr Creedy. John Hurt hams it up as the disgusting Chancellor and Stephen Fry basically plays himself, again.<br/><br/>Fans of the Matrix will spot the Wachkowski's slick stylish influence on the film as well as the indulgent script. People expecting the Matrix will, however, be disappointed. Apart from a well choreographed fight scene at the end this is a film about words and ideas rather than martial arts and CGI. They would perhaps prefer Batman Begins. Which, similar in many ways to V, has weaker dialogue but is more action focused. Having read the graphic novel upon which this is based I was pleased to see many of the ideas given expression on the big screen. Some elements of the novel have even been improved. Sadly much of the central theme of the novel has been abandoned and simplified for mass consumption. The main plot has been ""updated"" and I would say over-complicated to make it more relevant to the current situation. <br/><br/>Finally the film contains the usual problems associated with predictions of the future. For example why are they still using Dell computers if the US has collapsed? Technology (cars, phones TVs) has not moved on in 20 years. Evey claims she has not eaten butter since she was a child but everyone in the film lives in spacious London houses and have access to luxuries such as Champagne and Tobacco. These are minor irritations though.<br/><br/>In conclusion it was a thought-provoking enjoyable film but may suffer from being too focused on the present. It could have posed deeper questions about the themes which the novel is based around; Anarchy and Order, Fear and Love. Vengeance and Forgiveness. <br/><br/>Contact me if you want to discuss it more, or would like a link to the comic/website.<br/><br/>ingrey@hotmail.co.uk"

","Well, I put off going to this film after reading a couple of reviews. It sounded a little lame, and the last time I saw Natalie Portman she was less than rewarding. This time, however, she captured my attention and held it like you would expect a beautiful young woman to do, though with her own twist, namely that her persona manages to speak of her humanity more strongly than her physicality. It seems Natalie has deepened her skills since The Professional. Still, the movie relies on her performance to the extent that it would have failed if she had faltered. She doesn't. <br/><br/>No, I walked away from the movie tonight totally amazed that this 2 hour plus movie had managed to keep me riveted to my seat like some old Bingo player needing only one mroe square to win the night's big jackpot. And my wife, no fan of either action movies or political thrillers, was miraculously just as mesmerized. <br/><br/>This movie is a towering achievement, and there's no doubt in my mind that it will be the standard in its genre for a long time to come. And if you thought Hugo Weaving a slightly odd choice for Agent Smith in his last big role, watch him win you over in this film. He does it with insight and intuition despite extreme limitations (a Guy Fawkes mask). And John Hurt is every bit as righteous and outraged as some of our real politicians, making him all too easily recognizable.<br/><br/>I love this film! V may introduce himself with about 1,000 more words than necessary, but quickly, this film makes its points like some master litigator building an ironclad case. Oh I looked at my watch alright, but not to see how much more I had to endure, but how much of this cinematic miracle was left before I'd be unceremoniously thrown out into the cold, cold night. To say this screenplay is brilliant is a colossal understatement. It's almost impossible to believe any writing team could have dreamed it up, much less one where one of the team is seeking a sex-change operation in a real-life. And considering that the Wachowski brothers were responsible for The Matrix as well, I thank my lucky stars that I didn't grow up to be in competition with these guys! Quite unlike the Matrix sequels, this movie is very much the worthy of successor of The Matrix.<br/><br/>A couple of after thoughts: If you've heard about the Holocaust allusions, don't worry. You're not pummeled into submission with yet another account of that tragedy. And two, I fervently hope this operation they're talking about doesn't diminish their ability to create mind boggling cinema. That would truly be a tragedy, all around."

I walked out of the theater wowed because for the first time ever the characters' interactions with each other were more important than the special effects. <br/><br/>It was funny, cheesy (purposefully), interesting, smart, and had a point other than fighting the bad guy of the week. True action/fighting sequences are few and far between in this movie, but that is what made it stand apart. <br/><br/>If you are going to see this movie because you are expecting an action-packed, CG, green screen, fighting movie, you WILL BE disappointed.

"David_Frames","2","9","18","20 March 2006"," The vendetta is against the audience
","..and you might wonder what you did to deserve it if you're forced to sit through this imbecilic, pretentious candy floss. If Brazil and Nineteen Eighty-Four are the perfect fusion of botanicals and base spirit in bleak totalitarian terms then V for Vendetta is the tasteless engine lubricant that passes for gin, served in Victory Square. Ripped from the soiled pages of Alan Moore's 1989 Anti-Thatcherite fantasy, it envisions a Britain (though in the movie this is freely interchangeable with England betraying the ignorance of the screenwriters) that's been taken over by a tyrannical despotic government. All freedoms are curtailed, though sadly not the freedom to talk in long-winded sentences but we'll come back to that. 'V' is a terrorist who plans to change all this by dressing as Guy Fawkes, that other, er, champion of the oppressed masses, - hatching a plan to destroy Parliament, by now a symbol of repression and intolerance thus liberating the populous  Guido redux if you like while John Hurt, inverting his Winston Smith role, grimaces and gesticulates as the Stalinesque Chancellor who V plans to permanently deselect. I've not read the graphic novel and this is something I share with the filmmakers if the result is anything to go by. In fact so muddled are the politics, so flat the direction and so poor the performances that it feels from start to finish like the filmic equivalent of a dirty protest. Vendetta's conception is a washout in every respect. The poorly structured, badly written screenplay by the Warchowski Brothers is primarily to blame. Why are these people given so much latitude? Didn't anyone see the Matrix sequels? The brothers grim commit their own act of cine-terrorism by creating a sort of England USA where the English speak a sort of Californian-cockney. Listening to it recalls the scene from Star Trek 4: The Voyage Home is which Kirk suggests that they try to communicate with the space probe mimicking whale song. Spock points out that this would be pointless as you'd be copying the sounds not the language resulting in ""gibberish""  its as if all the dialogue in this film has been channelled through the same translation software. The brothers know some English colloquialisms but have no idea how they are naturally used in real speech. American audiences won't care of course but for the real English it will be an effort not to laugh your way through the whole thing  it'll be all you can do to stay awake. This is like grit in the eyes but sadly, it's not the worst of it. The dire-logue aside it's the total poverty of ideas that really gets to you as it drags on..and on. The government of the future has been so successful in crushing the will of the people that's it turned all Londoners into clichés who helpfully sit on their sofas and watch the telescreen all day, lapping up V's simplistic messages of dissent or alternatively they're the proles, drinking in dank pubs  looking downtrodden and fixated on drink. Yes indeed, this is very much British life as I'd imagine it to be were I from Illonois. The screenplay is incredibly wordy  very long speeches, exposition follows exposition. Those hoping for some action to liven up the proceedings or break up the dull patches will feel their heart sink into their stomach long before it crawls to its plodding climax. The worst points? There are so many but V's demented Dandy routine accounts for most  Natalie Portman sounds like a New Zealander who ever so often remembers to enunciate an English vowel (badly)  the scene in which she dresses as a school girl so tow curlingly embarrassing as to make her work on Star Wars look Oscar winning by comparison.Hugo Weaving is wasting his time as the man behind the mask as he could be played by anyone  in fact Eryol Flynn's corpse could have matched this level of performance and for Steven Fry, an intelligent man so we're told, this should be a deeply depressing episode. I'm sure the idea of playing a repressed gay man who appreciates classic literature but can't openly say so must have been a lure but my goodness, it's the febrile complex on the film's pallid, diseased face. In bonfire night terms, V for Vendetta is like a knocked off firework in an expensive looking box  once lit it doesn't go off for 2 hours and when you go to check it, the thing blows up in your face scarring you for life. One mark for the use of the Julie London song (very droll) and one mark for those dominoes but that aside this is a hideous waste of effort. The rack, noose and knife for all concerned please."

","If you are having doubts about this movie, I highly suggest overcoming them. I had expected it to be an action movie cashing in on the political anarchy theme in the shallowest of way. After seeing that it had led the box office all weekend, I gave it a shot. I was definitely happy with my decision. The movie contains a deep and complex story of a futuristic Britain, lending to political satire of current leadership as well as fully developed characters. The plot never had a dull moment and no holes to count. Also, the action was exciting in the style of the first matrix. Rarely does an action movie invoke so many different emotions. The witty comedy, well written screenplay, deep sympathy for the characters, and flashy action comes together in a way no other movie has in quite some time."

","This is probably the most powerful movie I have ever seen and definitely one of the best movies I have seen in the past year (this is counting 2005). From the previews I thought it would be awesome and being a comic book geek I've been eagerly awaiting it for almost a year. Now normally when something gets hyped up like that there is no way it can live up to your expectations, but this simply went above and beyond them.<br/><br/>The movie's theme is not original, in fact it's basically the sequel of 1984 (both movies cast John Hurt as well, though in completely different roles), but that's not important. I love movies that are all about governments going too far and the people finally standing up to them. It inspires me to believe that we can really make a difference in our world, but I've never seen a movie with this theme that has moved me so much. Yes, it's moved me so much that I have begun to use clichés in order to explain my feelings towards it.<br/><br/>""I laughed, I cried, it moved me Bob.""<br/><br/>There were a few things that rubbed me the wrong way, like Natalie Portman's accent. Now, I have nothing against Natalie Portman, I love her in fact. I think she is a great actor and I think she did an incredible job in this movie, but her accent just sounded really fake. I suppose we can't win 'em all... I also wasn't entirely sure if I liked some of the director's (James McTeigue) choices in the fight scenes. In the last action scene with V vs. Creedy and his goons they made it look like a comic book which in turn made it look a little too Matrixy for my taste, but I still think it was a cool scene.<br/><br/>I recommend that you go and watch this movie in the theatres, because it is most certainly worth the money and if you are reading this too late to do that, go and buy the DVD.

","I went to see this film with average expectations. The trailers were there, the posters were there but was it really going to be all that good. Well I can safely say it was, I was glued to my seat. When I wasn't listening intently to every syllable coming from the mouth of the hero V, I was delighted with exciting fight sequences and a few explosions which left me feeling nothing less than liberated. When someone informed me that Hugo Weaving would have the mask on throughout the entire film I was concerned that the character would never be able to connect with an audience at all never mind portray strong emotions, key to such a character and I believed I would quickly loose interest. However Weaving managed to keep me extremely intrigued by V. Something I could never have imagined possible without having seen it done. Weaving has a charisma perfect for this role and I can't imagine anyone else playing V so well. The other actors also kept me interested in every character that came across the screen, especially John Hurt who I thoroughly enjoyed hating. Natalie Portman was a joy to watch. Although her British accent wasn't so fantastic her presence on screen more than makes up for it. The non-conventional theme of fascist governments and terrorist hero's may not be for everybody but I certainly found this film one of the most entertaining things I've seen in a long time. A+++ from me."
"Pasafist","2","15","34","17 March 2006"," V FOR VENDETTA is just sad.
","V FOR VENDETTA is pure drivel. I get that out of the way at the top of this review because I know it will not be the popular opinion. But at some point I've realized that I'm nobody if I'm not honest. So I'll say it right now, V FOR VENDETTA is not an action movie, it's a propaganda film. It's a film about how great anarchy is.<br/><br/>About 50 or 70 years into the future Great Britain is run by a totalitarian dictator (John Hurt). Books, music, and all sorts of free expression are banned. The government has created a police state that keeps people in line. Then a shadowy masked figure named V (Hugo Weaving) steps out of the shadows and fights the government by exposing their corruption through terrorist actions. Buildings are blown up, television signals are stolen, and caught in the middle of it all is Evey (Natalie Portman). Evey, the reluctant student of the mysterious V, will play a pivotal role in overthrow of the government, whether she wants to or not.<br/><br/>Now where do I start. On a purely cinematic level this movie is not very fluid. Most scenes revolve around characters talking about how horrible things are. They talk and talk and then talk some more. The screenplay is so verbose that any action you may have been expecting flashes by in seconds. V's origin is told and retold at least 4 different times and there is a subplot involving an actress that just goes on and on.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the film, the best scene involves a humorous take on the government. It's bold and the man involved in the full on attack of the social order doesn't parade around in mask. He's bold because he puts his name and face out for the world too see. Yes he pays the consequences for his action, but he used the tools at hand to subvert the government. He didn't need bombs, he didn't need violence, he just needed to be socially disobedient.<br/><br/>But V this movies hero hides behind a mask of platitudes and terrorist actions. He's too proud to put his face out there for the world to see. He's like a man who writes a manifesto about how horrible the world is and signs it with an alias. Who wants to listen to a coward. V believes that the only way to get people to listen is to blow things up and to murder the men in charge. But what then? Do you start another government? Does that one become corrupt? I know its not a popular idea but did you ever just think that maybe human beings are rotten to the core? That our hearts are dark? That if given the right circumstances we all could be Hitler? I know I've lied, I've stolen things, and I've hurt the people I love the most. I've even made my wife cry and I know there are people out there that think I'm a jerk. So I ask you am I good person? I strive to be, but the human condition drags me down.<br/><br/>That's why we invent law. Whether it be moral law, or traffic law, laws are put in place to fight against the human condition. But Laws are so easily corrupted, from going 35 in a 25 miles per hour zone, or murdering your neighbor for his sneakers, we break laws because we are weak, selfish and at our cores we don't want anybody to tell us what to do.<br/><br/>V operates in a place where humans are basically good except for those that disagree with him. Government and greed are the problems. He and those who agree with him are the ones who are right. Organized religion is wrong. Politics is wrong. If we can somehow get rid of them the world will be a better place. But alas isn't he himself turning his followers into robots? What if one of his followers challenged him? Would he be labeled a traitor? Would he be sent away? The final outcome of V FOR VENDETTA may seem helpful, but why replace one tyranny for another.<br/><br/>I know I've gone off on a tangent here. I know my comments may make some people angry. But alas I live in America and for all the horrible things that are going wrong, I'm glad I can still thank God that I live in a country where many men and women strive to do what's right. I can question my government without having to resort to terrorist actions and where men and women can believe what they want. We are ""One Nation Under God"", be it a Christian God, or a Muslim God, or Zeus the God Of War. My faith in America is not in the government. My freedom is not protected by George W. Bush or V the mysterious masked vigilante. It come from some place higher, some place stronger than myself. Terrorism breeds more terrorism. Anarchy breeds nothing but chaos and V FOR VENDETTA is a horrible education in hedonism and nihilism.<br/><br/>Do you want change the world? It begins in the human heart. It begins when you strive to do good regardless of whether the Government is protecting you or not. It's means dying not for self, but for others and striving for truth and not empty platitudes. V FOR VENDETTA is about a coward, and that's just sad."

","(=""Screwed up theatrical adaption from a visionary tale"")<br/><br/>The Wachovskies continued here what the already did with their Matrix trilogy: while the first part was an interesting and highly entertaining variation of Descarte's methodic doubt (do I really exist, or is all that I see, hear and smell just the coincidental one-second-glimpse imagination of a one-cell bacteria which I truly am?""; watch Carpenter's Dark Star"" for more details), they dismantled it themselves with two sheer-below-mediocre sequels with virtuous but pointless action, plot-hole-chains, horrible performances, grotesque attempts in coolness and hazardous dialogs. <br/><br/>When I read Vendetta"" first in about '91 or so, I was once more reminded that we're yet not safe from the menace which my country unleashed over the world in the 30s and 40s last century and that it can occur anytime anywhere again. The vision of the novel was as credible, authentic and fearsome as many news-broadcasts today. Which is what the author tried to accomplish as he mentioned in his foreword in the trade-paper-release I owned then. If I recall correct he mourned about cheeky (cheery?) and cheesy, soaps, comedies and music-shows"" and about ... people who turn off the news..."" there. He dedicated the novel to ... people who don't turn off the news...""<br/><br/>The Vendetta""-movie-adaption is for people who turn off the news.<br/><br/>A valuable blueprint of a possible dystopia which played in the same league as 1984"", Fahrenheit 451"" or Brazil"" has been turned into a useless action-flick, lacking any political ambition or any attempt to subversively play with the viewers perceptions and political convictions. You leave the theater without anything to cut your teeth into or a matter to discuss controversially. And that despite the fact that the story today has enough actual events to function as an allegory for, as it had when it was written (war-propaganda, media-control, cutting of civil-rights, unbalanced and misanthropic economy etc). Hell, even Mad Max II"" was probably more political than this flick.<br/><br/>All the characters were real in the novel and became comic-characters in the film. Especially V"" is now a one-dimensional clown who rushes through the dialogs like a rabid rocket and through all the fighting-scenes like the energy-cell-rabbit: It has no blood, no animae..."" (Grosse Point Blank""). All those brilliantly placed quotes from literature-history that V used on any given occasion and during any terrorist action in the book turn into a what-did-he-mumble jelly here. Too fast for everybody who didn't read the novel, hell even too fast for those who did and -worst of all- too fast to celebrate the punchlines behind them. Who swaps drama for dynamic, deserves to lose both.<br/><br/>The story is an only fast forward. The fear of a fictional but credible fascistic regime that drowned out of every page of the novel got replaced by constant sensory-nervous-system-attacks and by the annoyment and anger about todays regular one-cut-per-second-editing-for-the-Mtv-generation; If it's too slow, people can't follow."" God, I miss Alfred Hitchcock...<br/><br/>I paid much attention on the Konzentrationslager-background of V but it didn't struck me at all as it did while reading it. Au contraire: Look what a cool fighter V has become there. Gee, Concentration-Camps can't be that bad..."" Folks, this is dangerous!<br/><br/>It's plain obvious that it was the wrong decision to let some non-UK-filmmakers do the project; some British would have better done this. No anti-americanism here, not at all, but the priorities would have probably been set elsewhere then and for sure on the more essential aspects than just on the visual and martial-arts. All the important side-stories were cut too. They should fold the Watchmen""-project right now.<br/><br/>Turn on, Turn on, Turn on - THE NEWS!!!""

It could be a great action movie, but they wasted too much time being a ""documentary"", who cares? People kept talking and talking and talking about bullshit I have seen thousands of times before. They should have concentrated on the action and less on these speeches. This Talkathon would have been a great movie, were it not so preachy. How about the main character? Where did he get all his shakespearean knowledge? They never explain. Stupid movies always try to throw Shakespeare at you, thinking that maybe that will save it.

One of the most important themes in the film is the question of what is more valuable - safety without freedom or breathing a true life.

Natalie Portman's performance is stunning and although Hugo Weaving is not seen his voice is perfect for the mask that will haunt us in our dreams. V for vendetta is a must see for anybody who enjoy's a good time at the theatres.

"vince85","8","6","11","29 March 2006"," Pretty Awesome
","This film is powerful; mostly because of how different it is from every other blockbuster. Set in a possible future where America is in ruins and England is ruled by a totalitarian dictatorship - the plot focuses on a mysterious rebel named V played by Hugo Weaving {Agent Smith of the Matrix}. He lives in London, wears a mask, models himself on Guy Fawkes and as such, is essentially a terrorist. It is his aim to encourage the populace to rise up against an oppressive regime, which until now, has not been successfully opposed.<br/><br/>The story revolves around V and a girl he meets named Evey, played by Natalie Portman. Their first chance encounter allows V to introduce himself near the beginning of the film; where Hugo's background as a Shakespearean actor is put to good use in a long and slightly ridiculous monologue that is more than vaguely reminiscent of 'the architect's' over-wordy contributions to the matrix trilogy. However, this is the only point at which I felt the erudite nature of V's character was slightly overstressed.<br/><br/>The well choreographed action sequences keep the pace of the film high as is only to be expected with the direction of the Wachowski brothers. The comic book background must be remembered when it comes to realism at certain points; but the overall premise is made quite believable with stories within the story explaining and answering the audience's questions as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Overall, V for Vendetta is not just entertaining, but also highly thought provoking. Like a modern day '1984', it paints a fascinating picture of a future dystopia without forgetting to develop its characters, all while keeping the audience interested throughout. Don't just go and see this film if you fancy an action-packed no-brainer; you might find the plot a little too intricate and original for your liking..."

What V says "" The people should not be afraid of the governments,the governments should be afraid of their people."" is very true, and this movie gets that message across easily. I have a feeling that this movie will be nominated for many, many,many, MANY awards, and believe me, it deserves it.

"JimEldred","2","8","16","10 June 2006"," V for Vucking Verrible
","This film seems to have received very high praise indeed. I hate to fly in the face of such adoration, but it left me cold and rather irritated. Sure, there are a few nice bits and pieces in there, but it's all done in such a cack-handed way that it raised more than a few unintentional laughs with the audience I saw it with. The film is terribly structured and almost completely un-engaging.<br/><br/>I've never read Moore's graphic novel but I can only assume it is a masterpiece beside this. I am not surprised he has since renounced Hollywood (especially after The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and From Hell - which are also awful, for similar reasons).<br/><br/>This film is full of big ideas on Britain's dystopian future and the growing dissatisfaction with New Labour and voter apathy. ID cards, retinal scans, curfews, terror laws, media control, culture of fear etc - the film throws in every reference from Guantanemo and the war in Iraq to race riots and the rise of the BNP.<br/><br/>And therein lies the problem - it's all sixth form politics. Politicians are cruel, the police are thugs, there's a conspiracy under every desk etc. We've seen it all before of course (1984, Brazil etc), but this film is so black and white it never has any subtly. Not that this is the main problem with the film - the whole thing is just badly put together.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty awful. Hugo Weaving does his best, but it's all one-note - and listening to a mask talk for 2+ hours hardly makes the cod-philosophical waffle easier to digest. And waffle there is aplenty - almost as bad as Matrix 2/3 put together. As a result the scenes drag - did the film really have to be 2 ¼ hours long? Natalie Portman only starts to act once she has a hair cut. I was never convinced why Evey was helping the freak with the mask anyway - they try to set up a Beauty & the Beast / Phantom of the Opera motif between V and Evey, which falls pretty flat. There is hardly any chemistry between them - and V's not frightening either. Just faintly ridiculous, especially wearing an apron whilst making French Toast. John Hurt is nice casting seeing as he was in ""1984"", but his scenes are mostly filmed behind a desk and must have taken all of an afternoon.<br/><br/>The police scenes are limp and betray the lack of budget - the country's entire anti-terrorist force are two detectives bumbling around an office. ""So what now Chief?"" one of them says. Stephen Rea, whose performance is as charismatic as Droopy Dog - stares at his computer for a moment. ""Let's go here,"" he suggests. Cut to Rea and his sidekick standing on a murky soundstage. ""Another dead end, let's go back to the office"". Etc etc etc.<br/><br/>The worst moment comes when Stephen Fry proudly shows Evey the latest episode of his ""satirical"" TV chat show where he lampoons the Prime Minister in some kind of Benny Hill romp. This is toe-curlingly bad. Are we, the viewer, supposed to find this funny or scathingly satirical? Because it's neither - just shockingly inept.<br/><br/>Every 15 minutes we get a crescendo of music, dramatic dialogue and grave faces - only for nothing to actually happen. All the start/stopping makes the film trudge to a soggy conclusion where we get another hack message rammed down our throat - we as a people can topple nasty governments if we all act together (oh and blow up Parliament). Great, but replace them with what? This call to revolution is just old hat - the very act of destruction maybe satisfying, but the film gives us no characters that give us any sense that the struggle has been worth it. The film's climax is therefore a hollow victory. And they stick Stephen Fry in the crowd at the end for effect. Sadly, by then I couldn't give a rat's arse.<br/><br/>2 out 10"
"MovieManMenzel","9","8","16","19 March 2006"," ""V for Vendetta"" is one of the best big budget blockbusters to come out of Hollywood in years.
","""V for Vendetta"" takes place in the future when Britain is in a fascist state. The people of Britain are no longer free to stand up for themselves and are being controlled by their government. The story begins when a girl named Evy (Natalie Portman) is attacked in an alley way and a masked man named V (Hugo Weaving) appears and saves her life. V's goal is to help Britain reclaim its independence and V will stop at nothing in order to help his fellow citizens' rise up and take back the rights that were taken away from them. But Evy is a key part to this story as it's up to her to discover the truth about V and herself in order to bring freedom back to a society that is overruled with cruelty, fear, lies and corruption. A great movie ensues <br/><br/>Wow! Why can't all big budget mainstream films be as good as ""V for Vendetta""? I literally think this movie is one the best mainstream films to come out in the last 5 years. The movie not only contains some great special effects and action sequences but also a well written thought-provoking script and some great performances. Finally, Hollywood has made a film that is a perfect mix of both an independent film (great writing and acting) and a mainstream film (great action sequences and special effects).<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" is a film that surely didn't disappoint me at all. The thing most movies like this lack is good acting and a half way decent plot. Not this movie, this movie is golden with a great plot and great acting. I think the main problem with Hollywood movies is that they lack one element or the other. When watching this film, you are hooked to it from the opening credits all the way till the end. The special effects are solid and aren't overused like in ""The Matrix sequels"" or ""King Kong"". There is enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire film. The movie keeps its audience both excited to see what happens next but it also keeps them thinking which is rare for a big budget movie.<br/><br/>At times, ""V for Vendetta"" seems to hit a little too close to home. Certain events the film addresses such as the fear element and government cover-ups don't seem like fiction at all anymore. I think this movie allows us to be entertained but also question what is going on in our world as well. It's a movie that provides everything that a normal Hollywood movie will contain special effects, action, a fictional hero but it also contains some realistic and thought-provoking ideas that many films of this nature don't normally produce.<br/><br/>This movie was directed by James McTeigue, a man who worked as assistant director on ""The Matrix Trilogy"". For being a first time director, this guy has the skills to pay the bills. Maybe the Wachowski Brothers helped him out but regardless he did an amazing job capturing all the excitement moments and the emotions of the characters. There are several amazing scenes in this film that just blew my mind including the final scene.<br/><br/>The Wachowski Brothers wrote the script for this amazing movie and I guess this movie can serve as their apology for the 2nd and 3rd Matrix which I deem as really bad films considering the first one was a Hollywood masterpiece and a one of a kind film.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, I am falling in love with Natalie Portman all over again. Her acting in this movie is superb. Her character is likable, realistic and believable. She has really come a long way since her career in film began. Her roles in ""Closer"", ""Garden State"" and now ""V for Vendetta"" prove that she has the ability to be one of the new leading ladies in Hollywood. Although Hugo Weaving's face is not seen during the film, I still feel the man did an excellent job as V. Even though he wears a mask during the entire film, you can still feel the emotions his character is feeling. It was a job well done. Stephen Rea also did an incredible job as Finch, the detective who was trying to solve the case of Code name V during the entire movie. He gave a fine performance. And finally all the rest of the supporting cast was great too. Everyone in this film did a great job.<br/><br/>So In Conclusion, if you're tired of seeing a big budget action movie that is all special effects and no substance, go see ""V for Vendetta"". If you like movies that have good stories go see ""V for Vendetta"". If you like movies in general you will probably like ""V for Vendetta."" It's a rare movie that so many audiences alike can enjoy and unlike most big budget films you can actually leave your brain on during it. It's an amazing feat by Hollywood and I can't wait to see it again. It's truly the first great movie of 2006. Let's just hope they don't ruin it with a sequel.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""V for Vendetta"" is 9/10. A big budget blockbuster that really delivers!"

The film even brings up the question of whether a terrorist attack on their country was not carried out by extremists, but by their own government to continue to make their citizens live in fear,(9/11 many people are questioning the official story, because some have said it was an inside job). Excellent film everyone should see this film because someday the US might be a Totalitarian State where people are imprisoned for speaking out against the Government."
"Quinoa1984","10","8","16","17 March 2006"," the first excellent film I've seen in 2006
","I admit, I'll have to see V for Vendetta again to fully grasp some things about it- chiefly things in the story and dialog (that and I had a rather faulty screening of the film at the theater). But to say that I haven't been this excited about a film brought by Andy and Larry Wachowski, the Matrix creators, since their 1999 ground-breaker, is saying a lot. Some may not like the film, or may not 'get' it, as it does go for a lot of dialog and character development over useless explosions and violence (of course there's some in the film, but no in over-abundance). But it is, like the first Matrix, quite challenging in the futuristic story kind of way, taking more from Orwell this time at a look of totalitarian society and the humanism that lies beneath terror and fear through dominance. That it is also a well made and well acted film is much to its credit.<br/><br/>And while the film is credited as its director to James McTiegue, who was AD on the Matrix trilogy, one can see the Wachowski's (possibly akin to the V character) pulling the strings throughout in their script and co-producer credits. They take from a graphic novel and churn out something rather epic, and complex. V (Hugo Weaving, in maybe his greatest performance without a 'real' face) has set the date November the 5th as a kind of judgment day, as one year from that date he will return to change the course of history. But in this year's time Evie (Natalie Portman) gets in the cross-hairs, and becomes involved in his vengeance against the government that did this ""monstrosity"" to him. Through this there is an investigation by an officer (Stephen Rea), some good deal of back-story through flashbacks involving a tragic character who's life is scribed on a roll of toilet paper, and the whole story of how this totalitarian society in England came to be.<br/><br/>It's through this story, of which even I can't say that much more, that the Wachowski's deliver some action, however more food for thought than some might come in thinking it will be. For those expecting the non-stop action that went with the first Matrix you might be disappointed. But if you come in with an open mind, like with the Matrix sequels, it won't spell what came for many as disappointment. The talk in those films, which became muddled through the action at times, isn't so here. And through the cast of actors, who are all very, very good (particularly Portman, Weaving, Rea, and of course John Hurt as the high chancellor), there are some individual scenes that are just great, and entertaining, and involving dramatically in ways the filmmakers didn't quite get on their previous efforts. One favorite for me was the fake TV show with the two John Hurt characters in a comedy kind of scene. And the whole sequence with Evie in the 'prison' is surprisingly moving. If I could make criticism of the film upon a first viewing, yes, it is sometimes a bit 'talky', and the direction is not as astonishing as with the ones squarely helmed by the brothers.<br/><br/>But for any of the small flaws seen on a first viewing, I can say that they weren't enough to deter me from recommending it, enough even to say that it SHOULD be seen twice, even if there isn't much confusion on what the story or characters are. One thing's for sure, you're likely to see very few other science fiction dramas this original this year, if at all, and least of which challenge the viewer's expectations and intelligence like this does. And great song over the end credits, by the way."

I hear a string of words that are supposed to sound like intellectual ideas but all I hear is nonsense.<br/><br/>Examples of how you will actually lose brain-cells during the course of the film (IMDB doesn't even lie, just click on Quotes and see all the fun in store for you):<br/><br/>Eve: You're getting back at them for what they did to you.

"g_imdb-287","1","12","27","2 April 2006"," B*llocks!
","Before I write my review, there's three things people reading it should know:<br/><br/>1. I consider myself to be a liberal 2. I haven't read the graphic novel 3. I hated this film.<br/><br/>I'm also British (Scottish, specifically  get to that later) so I found a lot of little things about the film annoying  the accents, ""b*llocks!"", some pronunciations, and the fact that even as a totalitarian state Britain still comes across as really twee and naff. Our 'heroes' quote Shakespeare and almost everyone speaks with an upper-middle class accent (except a few of the 'baddies', who have accents associated with the working classes  odd considering the premise of the film and the fact that, as far as I know, the original book was based on Thatcherism). The terms English and British also appear to be interchangeable, which annoyed me and will certainly have annoyed lots of other Scots/Irish/Welsh people.<br/><br/>I hated the mask. It was awful and I found it quite distracting. I get that he was supposed to be theatrical etc but the dramatic dialogue and appearance just laboured the point. In fact everything about the movie was laboured, and I think that was the problem  the politics especially. It was overly simplistic, and if it's possible to rip off historical events then that's exactly what this film did to Nazi Germany. The position of Prime Minister had even been replaced with High Chancellor and the party's logo might as well have been a swastika, the colours were the same and everything.<br/><br/>Guy Fawkes, as far as I can tell, was most certainly not a selfless freedom fighter as he's portrayed in the film. The Wachowski brothers should have done some research. He objected to having a Catholic (James I) as king and wanted ""to blow the Scottish beggars back to their native mountains!"" apparently. <br/><br/>Oh, and the priest in the film is naturally a paedophile. I could go on and on but I won't. It's been a while since I've seen it, and somehow I doubt I'll be seeing it again.<br/><br/>Pants!"
"dg-op","4","13","30","1 May 2010"," Political propaganda full of clichés turn out to be a pathetic, mediocre movie
","The Wachowsky brothers just don't know how to tell stories (The Matrix trilogy is barely decent), and they prove me right with V for Vendetta. The story of freedom after repression, directed by the mediocre James McTeigue, is interesting, but the film (script and scenes) is full with cheap political propaganda, clichés and terrible performances (Natalie Portman disappointed me, Hugo Weaving is just ridiculous/stupid with the pathetic detail of the mask and Stephen Rea saved all his acting abilities for this film).<br/><br/>The problem of this film is that, in its mad necessity to do the political propaganda, tries to tell a lot of stories in one. And the result is a horrible, horrible script, where we see the performance of at least 100 characters!! To make the story ""intense"" McTeigue tries to put some ""comedy"" (pathetic humor in the scene where they make fun of the dictator), ""drama"" (the idiotic story of Portman's character entering in jail by the dictator, when later you realize that was V himself who do that (¿?), suspense (not effective AT ALL, of course), and -of course the ""top"" ingredient in American blockbuster industry- action (Not kidding: You'll see fires, bombs, police chasing, bullets all over the film, and, as a closure, a fire games' show).<br/><br/>But why can a movie be so overrated in its home country and so hated in THE REST OF THE WORLD? It's easy: The scenes work as individual scenes, but when you try to put a movie together, the result is terrible. American critics and public liked it since it deals with sensitive topics like totalitarianism, racism, homosexuality and others, and the film at the end has a ""positive message"". Nothing wrong with that, but I won't waste two hours of my life watching a political propaganda that is dressed as a ""movie"". If you haven't watched it, you're lucky. DO NOT WATCH IT!"
"TheMovieDoctorful","4","7","14","15 November 2018"," Completely Misses The Point Of The Source Material
","If you go into V for Vendetta not being a fan of the source material, you'll probably love this movie. If you don't find yourself strongly identifying with the anarchist themes of the source material, you'll probably love this movie. As its own entity, V for Vendetta is a solid early-2000s dystopian action film. However, as a fan of Alan Moore's and as an individual anarchist myself, I personally found James McTeigue's adaptation of Moore's 1989 classic to be a ""style over substance"" dumbing down of a classic work.<br/><br/>The acting is exceptional, even as a non-fan of the movie I have to admit this. Natalie Portman acts her heart out as Evey and her hysterical, out of control emotional breakdown to V after her emotional torture, interrogation and rebirth at his hands marks a career highlight for her performance-wise. She does a wonderful job going to the deep, dark corners of Evey's shock, trauma and embrace of her pain. Hugo Weaving absolutely killed it as V. I can't imagine anyone else in the role, he captures the character's mystery, his charisma and his creepiness wonderfully. He shares outstanding chemistry with Portman and his role here makes me want to see him in more heroic roles. He certainly has the presence for it.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is also undeniably impressive in its visual storytelling (At least, outside of its laughably over-the-top action sequences) Images like the fall of the Dominoes or the assembly of the rioters or even the explosion of the subway train (In theory, over-the-top and gratuitous, but in practice, unforgettable and beautiful) are all examples of gorgeous, unforgettable imagery that definitely gives some weight to the ideas that the film is at least trying to convey beyond pure dialogue. The dark, murky color scheme does an excellent job capturing the aesthetics of David Lloyd's artwork, while also evoking the odd feel of a 1940s War film. There was definitely deliberate, conscience thought and effort put into the visuals of V for Vendetta and how they would benefit the story.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with V for Vendetta is the characterization of V and how the directing frames him. Alan Moore has explicitly stated that he didn't write V as a character to root for, persay, but as a character who the audience must judge for themselves. V's status as a hero or a villain was entirely up to the perspective of the reader. The film constantly tells us that he's a morally ambiguous character, someone caught on the line between hero and villain, but it never actually shows the audience this. The triumphant musical score and gratuitous, Gun-Fu esque slow-mo of his fight scenes clearly tell the audience visually that this is the unquestioned hero of the film. This Equilibirum or Matrix style directing and fight choreography completely clash with what the film is trying to do. For all the talk of V's humanity vs. his inner monsterhood, we're never really shown what would constitute V as a true monster.<br/><br/>For all the talk of individuality, V for Vendetta spends an awful lot if its runtime telling its viewers what to think. The book was very heavy on the idea that both V and Norsefire were both toxic extremes of their ideologies; Norsefire was certainly worse, but V was still very much a terrorist. Even the title of the book ""V for Vendatta"" illustrates the deeply personal and subjective motivation behind V's original actions. The inherent message in not just V for Vendetta, but in nearly all of Moore's works, is ""don't trust your heroes."" It's that there is no such thing as benevolent power. V for Vendetta rejects the deep subjectivity and moral nuance of the book in favor of a traditional superhero. On its own, not unforgivable. As an adaptation of a deeply morally complex and groundbreaking political work, however, I personally found it to be unacceptable.<br/><br/>I also didn't appreciate how the heinous racial connotations of Norsefire's rule are, for the most part, largely ignored until the ending. It's heavily implied, but not a focus of the story as was the case in the book. The undertones of white supremacy in the film are just that; undertones. It's rather uncomfortable and deeply unsatisfying to see the British government make no mention of a concept of racial purity, which is deeply important in any critique of true fascist government, especially an adaptation of V for Vendetta. It felt as if McTeigue and the Wachowskis simply didn't want to mention such a touchy and sensitive topic, which is ridiculous if the film wants to be as rebellious as it superficially advertises itself as. Even Moore was annoyed by the film's dismissive ignoring of the racial politics of the source material.<br/><br/>I don't mean to be condescending at all. If you love V for Vendetta (2005), I can more than understand the appeal. Take the source material and its themes out of it, does it work as a film? Sure. The acting is great. The characters are fine. It has a great visual style. It would be deeply incredulous to call this a worse movie than the likes of The League of Extraordinary Gentleman or The Killing Joke (Both Alan Moore adaptations.) However, my ultimate problem with McTeigue's V for Vendetta is its lack of a spine. Its lack of ambition. This could have been one of the most thought provoking and challenging comic book films of all time, but instead, it's just another early 2000s Gun-Fu action film. And that deeply depresses me, as we're unlikely to see this story re-made or re-interpreted on film."
"legendoflink","5","7","14","28 January 2008"," Not Worth It
","Sure, there's some good stuff, but it's just not worth it. One of it's very numerous flaws is that there's a ton of ""drama"" about how ""oppressed"" homosexuals are, which brings the entire story to a crawl and messes up the pace. Sure, Hugo Weaving is funny, but that doesn't excuse the story being so bad. If you want decent drama, you're not gonna find it here. If you want action, too bad; ""V for Vendetta"" has hardly any, and what's there is mindless and mediocre. Not even cool, and nothing like the Matrix. I don't know what the Wachowski Brothers were thinking when they wrote this mess of a movie that no particular target audience can enjoy."
"mitchabramson","7","7","14","5 September 2006"," They get it , and politically miss it
","It starts off with a testimony to the importance of free speech; i.e. IDEAS. The movie purports to show the power of that basis for all freedoms: the freedom to speak your ideas, your insights, your criticisms. Since these freedoms have been suppressed by a conservative-style government (anti-immigrant, homophobic, anti-Islamic, etc.) , kept afloat with the help of servile media, the answer lies in ""V"" as freedom-fighter. So far, so good - and it IS good, but where Hollywood (always) turns the blind eye is that IN REALITY, it is on the nation's liberal left campuses for example, that any opinion other than that of say, gay activists, is condemned as homophobic; any opinion contrary to unlimited abortion-on-demand is seen as anti-feminist; to oppose racial quotas is to be seen as ""racist."" The media is continually in the hip pocket of the left, and the IDEA of free-speech that ""V"" is championing are the very ideas liberal left-wingers will literally not allow to be spoken on campuses, in most Hollywood movies as well as the mainstream press. Having lived 4 years in the mideast, let me say it is obvious neither the Wachowski brothers, the director or the screenwriter had actually read the Koran, which they make a point of protecting from the angry xenophobic gov't. Had they done so, they would have seen that everything ""V"" id FOR is OPPOSED in a book that would suit well on any fascist's shelf. Mein Kamp would have been the same choice. Aside from turning real-world politics 180 degrees on its head, it's a fun movie that demonstrates Natalie Portman is the real-deal and hopefully we'll be seeing and hearing a lot more from her."
"c1mclaug","10","7","14","24 March 2006"," An astonishing film
","I've never read the V novels, in fact I didn't even know they existed, so it was only the clips I'd seen in the cinema and the fact the 'superhero' was British for a change that tempted me to view this film of which I fully expected it to be yet another special effect centred film about an all brawn and no brain superhero ala Batman, Hulk, Fantastic Four, etc etc etc. <br/><br/>Well was I in for a surprise as I spent 2 hours plus totally and I do mean totally enthralled. I can't think of any bad points in this film, honestly I can't, cast and crew have combined to produce a very very enjoyable and worthwhile film that leaves the viewer entertained, angry, sad, puzzled, elated and at times gob smacked. <br/><br/>So why has this 'superhero' film succeeded where others fail. Well other 'superhero' films I've seen have no story, one dimensional characters and an over indulgence of and reliance on CGI effects to take the audiences mind of the fact that well......there is no story and the characters are one dimensional. This film on the other hand has a story worth telling, characters worth portraying and special effects only used when and where needed. <br/><br/>The two principle actors in V portray their parts exceptionally well, Natalie Portman is both vulnerable and strong in her role while Hugo Weaving is immense, hidden behind his mask for the entire film the richness of his voice and his use of body language more than make up for the lack of facial expression and in a way having V maintain the same ghoulish / cartoonish smile regardless of whether he is killing an enemy or dancing with Evie is at times very unnerving and adds to the mystery of his character and his motivations.<br/><br/>So is V a terrorist or a freedom fighter ? Does he bring fear to the populace or hope ? Well V certainly kills and V destroys, but V only kills those who are collaborators to the oppression, those who helped bring fascism about and maintain it such as members of the government, the media, corporate business and science. V does blow up buildings but these buildings are symbols albeit corrupt ones and their destruction bring embarrassment to the government and hope to the people. <br/><br/>Who is V? In a fascist state some type of underground resistance would form, hiding itself away, disguising itself, bringing others into it's fold, testing their loyalty taking any opportunity to hit back at the regime, too destroy any symbols of oppression....for me this is what V represents, he is all those who would fight for their freedom condensed into one man, he is what we would all hope to be given the same circumstances. V is me, V is you, V is those who cry freedom.<br/><br/>Finally do we live in a fascist state? Is the USA or the UK fascist states, no I don't believe they are and I hope they never are, but just how far down the road of new laws, more restrictions and increased surveillance must we travel before we recognise such changes for what they are. <br/><br/>We passengers really should pay much more attention to route the driver is taking us just now, let's not be complacent for our children's sake."
"awmhill","10","7","14","19 March 2006"," When ideas become matter
","The Wachowski brothers accomplish yet another extraordinary commentary on society at large. Of course the film contains action and drama but without the emotional intensity of the Matrix. We knew that the heroin would be with us at the end of the film and overall there were little surprises with the direction of the plot. It was refreshing to see that the Wachowskis can have a flare for the dramatic as well as a solid, directional script that is still captivating. What was most compelling were the personal journeys of the characters whose past histories lead to present actions. While this scenario implies determinism, the film has a very clear focus that personal choice directs history. Without an antagonist or protagonist to focus on, the viewer is able to absorb the entirety of the film for a forceful message. Sentient beings are more than a body or a mind but an idea. An idea can bring about a catalyst for change that ordinary men wish only to study or follow. The father in the film turns himself into an idea to bring about redemption for those who wronged his family and a safer world for his child."

","There are many ways to expose corruption of the sort that defiles the memory of the Founding Fathers of this great nation we call the United States. One of the best ways is through art imitating real life and that is what has been accomplished with V for Vendetta. All anyone has to do while watching this movie is to draw the appropriate parallels with real life historical occurrences such as the Korean conflict, the Vietnam conflict with it's phony Gulf of Tonkin incident, the 1st Iraq conflict with it's the US put Sadaam up to the attack on Kuwait deal, the current Iraq invasion with its phony WMDs, and the upcoming heavily propagandized attack on Iran who could not possibly deliver a nuclear bomb in the next ten years (and even if they did we would destroy them with just one Trident submarine missile volley) to see ""behind the curtain."" <br/><br/>This is more than a movie, it is a WAKE UP CALL and all the totalitarian depictions in V for Vendetta can and is becoming a reality.

","I saw this movie without any pre-knowledge what it was about. The title made me assume it was about criminals and some long lasting vendetta.<br/><br/>Not a fan of gangster movies I was pleasantly surprised that it was about a imaginary near future where someone was taking on ""the mean and ruthless government"": hey, next to some inventive plotting there might even be some profound political comment about media influence and the power of images.<br/><br/>Sadly, the movie did not take one wrong turn, but made it a sport to take as many as possible. The script left the road that was laid out, and instead of making beautiful twists, it just... went nowhere. We have this man that obviously is the only man in this new England where all disturbing elements (foreigners, gays, Muslims) have been put in to boats to either Europe or America, that dares to challenge the powers that be. That's fine, we understand why: the people that control the streets are rapists, that's what is told us in the very first scene.<br/><br/>But after that, we are told that the real reason is that he was subject to some secret government tests for a viral weapon. Why is that reason added? Why do we have to unravel some plot of years ago, with a female Mengele apologizing on her death bed? Why do we have to be told some tear jerking lesbian love story halfway? Those added story lines have no use, slow the movie down and rub up some of the worst melodrama: Evey kissing the toilet paper where the killed lesbian has written ""I love you stranger"".<br/><br/>Then there are the clear plot mistakes: the late night presenter making fun of the dictator in such a way that he cannot seriously believe he will just pay a fine and do some charity fund raiser! V taking risks to kill all that tortured him: he wants to throw over the government, then they will be punished automatically, so what's the use? Evey, who is hunted down by a totalitarian regime, who leaves V's house to go... where? And her hair not growing an inch during all the weeks after her fake imprisonment! The cliché of them falling in love is so badly constructed that it hurts to the eyes. The inspector having some strange experience where he ""sees all"", even the flashbacks of the lesbian victims. Is he psychic? It all adds to the feeling of looking at something that was rewritten twenty three times and no one made sure that the movie was about one thing and one thing only: instead it is about a lot of things that all tumble another way.<br/><br/>The ending is especially awful, with some useless killing and a blowing up of parliament when the victory is already safe. Evey saying that V was ""everyone"" is gratuitous and nothing more than beautified writing: it gave me stomach pains.<br/><br/>It was then that I saw that it was Nathalie Portman I watched: okay, one actress more NOT to watch again.<br/><br/>All in all it left me with the question: why was this movie ever made? Then I went here, and it had a 8.2. And that was the reason I left a comment, for the very first time. This movie is not worth an 8.2. Not even half that."

","There are many ways to completely ruin great work. Even if you're trying really hard to be authentic to it. Let's face it, the Wachowski Brothers do not know how to write dialogs. There idea of characters are the kind on one end who have infinite knowledge of all subjects and are able to articulate them and the kind on the other end who ask the ""W' rudimentary philosophical questions that represent how they interpret the audience: ignorant. So us moronic viewers have to sit through a pile of overly-articulate monologue's and then right after the questioning of them by the ""Keanu"" character played in this film by Natalee Portman (who to her best efforts tries to do a good job.) So beyond ruining some great Alan Moore writing, the brothers decide to let some assistant director take the helm of the director's chair. The opening sequence was like a poorly made Bruckhiemer movie (as well as the ending sequence). Laced with melodramatic musical score and some editor who loves to cut, never letting us look at a single shot for more than 1 second. It was disorienting, especially compared to how most Moore comic books are sequenced, in a very cinematic way. I'm glad I saw it, because I realized why Moore disowned it and it's unfortunate that no one has able to give any of his work the appreciation it needs."

","I read about the comic a long time before I saw the film, and I was intrigued about how it would be handled on celluloid. England is run by a totalitarian regime some time in the future, the leader of the regime is played by John Hurt, who, fittingly played the role of Winston Smith in Michael Radford's version of 1984. The author of the graphic novels the film is based on apparently walked out of the premiere of the movie, and I can see why. The director of V for Vendetta obviously has a great love of the comic, because he does try to deal with the issues that are raised in the comic, but his ineptness as a director lets the comic down, badly. Among the issues, are how fear (caused by terrorism) can allow the public to be manipulated by politicians who then push through draconian laws which they claim to be for the good of the people but are actually covering darker ulterior motives. The editing is cringingly bad, it really makes you wonder if there was a director behind the production at all, the leads (Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving) rush their way through a script that clunks and grinds along for most of the movie. The 'relationship' between Portman's and Weaving's characters is totally implausible because there is not even a hint of a gradual development of Portman's trust in 'V', who is, after all quite a dubious character given that he wears a mask the whole time. That you're expected to believe in The dodgy London English accents (I should know, since I am a born and bred Londoner) add's to the farcical catalogue of other things that make this a bad film. I actually got quite angry about this one, because the subject matter is topical and raises a lot of questions, but it could have been handled so much better by a more accomplished director."

The politics were awful. I really needed Hugo Weaving to take off that mask, I wanted to see a human being. Instead we're looking at a psycho clown terrorist for 2 hours, and it's hard to understand what he's saying because his voice is muffled. Although I appreciated some of the fancy English dialogue he spouts off. Natalie Portman was good, but there's always been a soft spot in my heart for her ever since her great performance in ""The Professional"" when she was a cute little girl. She's the only saving grace of this movie, she brings some humanity to the otherwise cold, dark, bleak proceedings.<br/><br/>So his plan is to blow up the English Parliament, and he does. And everyone is happy. Why? Will a new government be formed now? Of who? People, that's who. And those people will run for office, and need a new building to house government proceedings. And these people will then be known as the ""nasty government"". And then everyone will start to hate them to, and then blow up their building. Blowing up buildings is not the answer, but the filmmakers appear to be sympathetic to this ""idea"". They appear to support terrorism.<br/><br/>America and the United Kingdom are not perfect obviously. But they have created the best form of government in the history of civilization, where the people vote and elect who we want to govern us. Fascism is not right around the corner, as much as Hollywood seems to want it to be. Collectively we're too advanced for that. No one is going to let it happen. George Bush? Please, he isn't smart enough for that. And even if he is, guess what, he's gone in a year. In America, we elect our government officials, if we elect a fascist, then i guess that's what the people wanted. If we elect a socialist...etc.<br/><br/>More insulting, the one book in the world most associated with terrorism, is the Koran, yet the filmmakers also seem to like that book. What a joke. And people think this movie is profound? Grow up. It's an insult. Make a movie about real terrorists, not Shakespearean English gentleman who sip tea if they weren't wearing a mask.<br/><br/>So, while interesting and entertaining at times, and Natalie Portman's lovely presence, ""V's"" politics make it an insult to anyone who understands what Democracy is."

They surely have their extraordinary power (like in the ""domino falls"" scene) but they're not what ""V for Vendetta"" supposed to be. Even the main character turned into some clown alike.

The character of V is one of the best portrayed characters I have seen in a while in a film. Through his very loose body language and Shakespearean language, he is acted out perfectly by Hugo Weaving. V was a bit frightening at times as well. Though he was masked the entire film, it was still easy to see his emotions and really feel what he was feeling. You know you have a great character when this happens. The character of Evey was portrayed perfectly by Natalie Portman. I was a bit skeptical of her being in this at first, but she quickly made me over come that and stunned me on screen with one of her best performances.

","I went to a screening of ""V for Vendetta"" last night and if you thought the ""Matrix Trilogy"" was bad then ""V"" will have you pulling your hair out like your name was Natalie Portman. Who by the way, wasn't the worst thing in this movie, which is kind of scary considering what an awful actress she has turned out to be. The movie comes across as little more than an ""anarchy sticker"" stuck on the bottom of some suburban punks' skateboard to look cool. Just like the suburban punk, the Wachowskis don't really believe in what they are displaying, they're just doing it to look cool. While ""V"" is completely unfaithful to comic book it was based upon, that is hardly its biggest crime. Come to think of it, compared to majority of this flicks offenses its little more than petty theft. ""V for Vendetta"" is remembered less for being a great comic book and more for being the work of a great comic book writer; Alan Moore. While nowhere near as good a book as his prior comics that were turned into films (""From Hell"" and ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen""), ""V"" does follow in suit as a yet another terrible and mishandled film based on Moore's writing. While nobody would consider the Wachowski brothers to be more than glorified video game creators, I was actually curious as to how they would handle adapting a script for a book overflowing with dialogue and light on flashy graphics. Where as the ""Matrix"" films are completely style over substance, the graphic novel ""V for Vendetta"" has countless scenes devoid of action or explosions but full of rich dialogue and character evolution. Unfortunately the brothers Wachowski, along with their partner in crime director James McTeigue screw it up so badly that if this film were ever shown in a football stadium, it could qualify as the longest fumble in NFL history. For a film that's supposed to be coated in rebellion and anarchy McTeigue and the Wachowski's never really give you a reason to believe in the terrorist hero V or his attacks on Parliament. Instead of giving you emotional and character driven reasons to come to conclusions on the cast, McTeigue and company visually shove it down your throat. You know John Hurt is bad because he's on a giant screen with huge black pupils (to show he's evil, cant you see how evil that is?) and that Portman is good because she is attractive and V is good because he causes explosions and painfully goes out of his way to attempt to illicit laughter from the audience. Not a single character in this has an ounce of reality to them let alone passion for anything going on around them. And why didn't they rerecord weaving's voice; half of V's dialogue is completely muffled due to the mask. Bloated, self important and without any meaning is all you have to remember about the 5th of November."
"Jay_Exiomo","5","10","23","15 March 2006"," Shades of reality
","Watching ""V for Vendetta"", I cannot help but juxtapose it with the political issues going in this country today. It is a film sourced from a material with a strong and intriguing message, although the execution lacks depth to make it more than a popcorn movie.<br/><br/>Based from the graphic novel written by Alan Moore (who I read refused to associate himself with this) and illustrated by David Lloyd, the film is set in a futuristic Britain where there is a totalitarian government run by an extremist right-wing, employing a Big Brother-like system of monitoring, after political unrest and mysterious viral outbreaks had taken their toll. V (Hugo Weaving under a Guy Fawkes mask) is the mysterious terrorist who is intent on bringing down this government.<br/><br/>He rescues Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman caught walking outside after the curfew has been put to effect and is about to be ""punished"" by police agents known as the Fingermen. Shortly after, he takes her to his lair and sets up an elaborate plan to free the people of England from their government that should culminate on the 5th of November.<br/><br/>First time director James McTeigue puts on a visual spectacle on screen but fails to elicit strong performances from the cast. Maybe it's not entirely his fault. As written and co-produced by the Wachowski brothers, the film has that ""Matrix"" feel into it, with some of V's lines reminding me particularly of Agent Smith that even beneath those mask, Weaving is so recognizable and gives an effective performance. But V, as well as Portman's character Evey, although likable, are weakened by a shallow and half-baked treatment of the story.<br/><br/>The action scenes manage to save the movie from the oblivious depths of mediocrity, if only to a certain amount of degree. The best part comes near the ending but it's not long and exciting enough to warrant the earlier parts of it.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" does have its moments but they are few and far between. It is visually striking but just as previous film adaptations of Alan Moore's graphic novels (""Constantine"", ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen""), something went lacking upon reaching the silver screen."

","We, the ""developed"" nations, are a controlled by fear. The media continuously bombards us with stories of terrorism, disease and disasters. The bigger the fear is, the more we allow our governments to control us, to dissolve our civil liberties.<br/><br/>In various nations people can be held with no trial or charge simply for looking a certain way, having faith in non-Christian gods, or being brown and having a beard. Claw for a hand optional. These people are tortured and humiliated.<br/><br/>Terrorism is a real threat, there is no denying it. There is only avoidance of the cause. Very little asking why, but a lot of finger pointing and knee-jerk reactions. These reactions are caused by fear but simply fuel terrorism, like a self-fulfilling prophecy it scares more and more people every day while the reactions fuel the anger of the terrorists. If we, the people, force our governments to examine and eliminate the causes of terrorism we will eliminate our own fear. This is unlikely to happen as the governments will no longer have the power to control us. The power of nightmares is strong, the politics of idealism long gone, we are firmly in the grip of the politics of fear.<br/><br/>This may lead to the situation presented in 'V for Vendetta'. A Naziesque totalitarian government keeps a tight grip on the citizens of Britain. Evey part of the media is controlled and every event is spun for the benefit of keeping the public in fear and the government in power. Until one man decides to fight back.<br/><br/>So is V the most subversive mainstream film to ever hit cinemas? Possibly. Is it a cheesy b-movie with bad acting and forced dialogue? Definitely ... and that's why I think it's brilliant. It's top level allows the subtext to get plastered on thick, and it's all the better for it."

Mockery of Christianity and its figures. Most of all, our hero. With a theatrical flair and classically educated wit, he emerges as a savior against oppression. His offering? Anarchy. Chaos. All of this he couches in terms like ""opportunity"" and ""hope"", but what hope does anarchy ever offer beyond destruction and disorder? Never does our hero offer his vision for a brighter tomorrow. He is a reflection of his real-world counterparts. They have sarcasm and criticism, but never a better idea. They offer only deconstruction, never accord. He thrives by the same tactics as those who he fights, yet it is his example that offers that better, cleaner page? The snide parallels this movie draws to the current political situation are arrogant, melodramatic and clumsy. I find myself wondering if this movie's creators escaped their own secret police raid complete with black bag tied about their heads. Again and again Hollywood rails (but it's only a movie, right?) against the very system and liberties that afford them the privilege of making this swill for a living. It's amusing. Perhaps they would enjoy comparing notes with Cuban, Chinese or Russian dissidents on what real oppression is.<br/><br/>The acting, direction and action of the movie were well done enough, but the story itself was absurd and comically insulting.

","Evey Hammond is heading out after curfew when the Government's Finger Men catch her and decide to enact their own form of justice on her. Her only rescue comes in the form of a masked man in a cape. This man then proceeds to show her the destruction of the Old Bailey. The Government spring into action to spin the story, control the people and find the terrorist. The police track Evey from CCTV and head to her work place (the Government controlled television station) to detain her. ""V"" arrives before them and uses the emergency station to broadcast his own message of unrest, elevating his ""terrorist"" stance against the Government in a year long war that will culminate on the 5th November one way or the other.<br/><br/>It probably helps to be in the UK to really appreciate what this film does well. I don't mean that in a snobby way but it is a success of the film that it produces a vision of the UK that is both futuristic but yet recognisable as our current condition. It does this most easily by visually mixing the design of homes and people's lives with all the trimmings of a totalitarian state but it also does it by making the links to our current political state of control and Government intrusion in the name of ""terrorism control"" and protection. Although it is only a year old, the film still shows a lot of foresight when viewed with hindsight and in doing so it produces an effectively bleak attack on our current political climate. It is effective mainly because it doesn't ever feel that far fetched thanks to the details but mainly thanks to the overriding themes of fear and control being used by a Government.<br/><br/>The surprise and joy of finding this level of social commentary in a what appeared to be a Hollywood action movie helped cover up some of the weaknesses. Some viewers have complained about the lack of action in the film; personally I do not see this as a weakness because this is more to do with how the film was sold rather than how it was made. The weaknesses are minor and include the asks the plot makes in regards the ability of V to do what he does and how far-fetched some of it is etc but, like I said, these are covered by how relevant and interesting I found the story. The cast are mostly good. It took me a good twenty minutes to accept Portman's accent but after that she won me over. She is very much in the shadow of Weaving, who shows what a great voice he has by producing a wonderful character without a glimpse of his face throughout. Rea is a bit dour but he does convince as a worn-down public servant faced with the truth about his masters. Fry wasn't that good but does what he had to do in a small role. Hurt and Pigott-Smith are both very good; Hurt particularly convinced as the sort of person who rises to power and delivered convincing lines in a convincing manner  it is telling he has little screen time but a large impact. McTeigue direction was surprisingly good and he delivered the whole affair with a real downbeat air while I'm sure some pressure must have been on him to deliver a big budget action movie for the summer season. He is well supported by the designers behind the visuals.<br/><br/>Those seeking action to compare with the Matrix (or even action) will feel let down and I can understand why  the trailers have talked up this side and talked down the social commentary side (and this is a damning verdict of how public tastes are viewed from Hollywood) but credit to the makers for producing a film that surprised me by how relevant it was. Over the coming years this will either become a thing of its time or more relevant than ever (I hope the former) but right now it is an effective story, told with the unreal air of graphic novel but with enough to link it to the present to keep it relevant. I was genuinely surprised by how good it was and how engaged I was by it."

The trailers and advertisements were all boring, and I had no intention of ever seeing this movie until a friend recommended it to me, and I'm glad they did! Hugo Weaving played the charismatic, masked anarchist named 'V', and he was fantastic at it. Not many actors can pull off playing a part as well as he did, especially when we never see his face. Aside from being an eccentric Guy Fawkes fanatic, V is also to be a great cook, a fan of Monte Cristo, a karate (?) expert, and much more, despite his horrible past. I absolutely fell in love with him! And his romance with Natalie Portman's character, Evey, was so endearing. He had that kind of awkwardly charming way of acting towards her, and I think that was what made this particular story unique: that even murderous anarchists can fall in love (or something like that), and that Evey could feel such affection towards him, even though 1) he tortured her, 2) he attempted to imprison her, 3) he has killed a lot of people and openly admitted to doing so, and 4) like 96% of his body is covered in third degree burns."

","Many people had a very negative reaction towards the second and third part of The Matrix trilogy, something I didn't quite understand but it seems that all the Wachowsky brothers needed to do to get back people's attention (in a positive way) was a change of scenery. Even though they didn't direct V for Vendetta their presence in the film making process and in the dialog is very evident. James McTeigue directs this slightly off key blockbuster and he certainly makes it his own. One could have feared that V for Vendetta would be just another Matrix copy but it isn't. Watch the film and you'll know.<br/><br/>The acting is generally on a very high level in the film but because of great casting but there are a few, just a few glitches. Natalie Portman who we know can act (at least those of us who have seen Closer and Garden State) is fairly good. When I say fairly good it is not because there is anything wrong with her emotional range as she portrays all the emotions of her character with great skill. No, its her accent. Her accent is not always completely believable. I'm not saying that her accent is downright bad because its not (its not like Kevin Costner's accent in Robin Hood) but there are a few moments where it is obvious that she is an American and not British. Stephen Rea does a good job with his character as well and he portrays both the urgency and the doubt of his character in a very satisfactory manner. Tim Pigott-Smith is decent as well. We don't really see his character that much but we see him enough to dislike him which is just what his purpose is. John Hurt is absolutely wonderful as the dictator, Adam Sutler. Even though we only see his face imposed on a wall screen for most of the film he manages to steal every of these scenes with his amazing facial expressions and confident tone of voice. Absolutely marvelous. Hugo Weaving who most people know as Agent Smith plays the title role and he is brilliant. Having to wear a mask throughout the entire movie he has to rely on his voice and on body language and it is here that he proves how incredibly talented he is because his character is incredibly diverse. Also he is given some of the more heavy dialog and he is very good at dealing with it possibly because of his experience from the Matrix films. He also has great sense of comical timing and is sometimes genuinely funny. Hugo Weaving is fast becoming one of my favorite actors. Two thumbs way up.<br/><br/>In terms of style the film is very unique. It isn't like any other action movie spit out by the Hollywood machinery, no. It has its very own style and it sticks to it throughout the entire movie making the overall impression much more polished and believable. The trailer promotes this film as very action packed. Its not. There are only a few excellently choreographed action scenes but that doesn't matter because when you're not thinking about the well written dialog you're looking at some beautifully atmospheric scenes. There are a few slow points in the movie and in these scenes it really helps that there is something to look at because it really helps the movie so that it doesn't come to a complete stop. The soundtrack is a little too vague for my taste, you don't really remember it after the film but at least its not intrusive.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta has come early here in 2006 but I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it winds up being one of the best films of the year because it really is a clever, moving and very entertaining film with great acting, suspenseful plot and great action.<br/><br/>8/10"

The sad reality is that for most of us, moments of clear conscience and absolute senses of right and wrong are far between the overwhelming activities of daily life. It is a thankful breath of fresh air and more than that a righteous social wakeup call to make films like V for Vendetta that remind everyone of us that some, I emphasize some, of these hideous truths are in fact a reality in this country and other countries.<br/><br/>To witness the imprisonment, the bleak reality of a detainee's hopeless existence and imminent death after their use to their captors has all but dried up, it tears a hole in any person who believes freedom and justice are truly the most important things in this country. While this film takes place in Britain, its themes and warnings are universal. I walked out of the theater hoping everyone who saw this film was reminded of vital ideas like ""The people should not fear their government, the government should fear its people"", and the value of the 'Question' and of defiance and ultimately of such basic values as tolerance, truth and justice. While V for Vendetta may only serve to echo these themes as they have been presented in dozens of other classic films like 1984 and the Manchurian Candidate, it stands apart in the absolute belief that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.<br/><br/>If a person could live their entire life with the hope and strength of will to spread justice and tolerance that this movie instills in us for the short time we are in the theater, there would be no need for such reminders as V for Vendetta, and the world would be bereft of tyranny and oppression."

","I can't say I've ever heard of the graphic novel by Alan Moore, but I hear he wasn't too pleased with this cinematic vision of his work. I cant say I was too overly impressed with it either; I saw it mainly because Natalie Portman thought the project was good enough to shave her head for, and even though the last two films by the Wachowski Brothers weren't very good, the first Matrix film made it obvious that they have a flair for action sequences. The plot is based on numerous ideas, all of which focus on government. V for Vendetta is supposedly a commentary on Thatcher's Britain, and this is mixed in with ideas stemming from Guy Fawke's plot to blow up the houses of parliament, and a revolution against the Government. The ideas are mostly very good; but there's too many of them, and many of the themes get lost in a convoluted plot that mainly sees a masked marauder calling himself 'V' picking off various members of government, while finding time to plant bombs and share a tentative near romance with the angelic Evey, played by the very talented Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>The film constantly nods towards more intelligent work, such as plays by William Shakespeare and Johann Wolfgang Goethe's 'Faust', and this serves to remind the audience of the shortcomings in this work. It has to be said that the technical work on the film is very good; the dark and brooding atmosphere works very well when coupled with the doomed vision of London. It would seem that The Wachowski's couldn't be bothered to direct their own screenplay, so that honour falls to James McTeigue, otherwise known as the first assistant director on The Matrix Trilogy. His direction is largely pretty good - he has an eye for aesthetics, and constantly makes use of the dark locations and many of the characters' dark clothing. The masked central character makes for a memorable anti-hero; but his spectre does look a bit silly, and seeing him constantly deliver convoluted dialogue in the style of 'The Oracle' soon wears thin. Natalie Portman looks stunning as always; even when she loses her luscious locks. The action is loud, brash and entertaining; and this provides the film with its biggest strong point, but it tries to be too clever and often ends up looking silly, as the plot is never deep or engaging enough for all the elements to really shine through. A shame; with the right handling, this could have been great."

For those who like action, violence, and special effects, hooray because this is your type of movie. V for Vendetta is an extravagant display of eye candy made for the viewer's pleasure. Yet, what about those who care for a great story? Well I'd say that V for Vendetta is as creative and superbly imaginative as cinema can get these days. The concept of an alternate totalitarian world, as depicted in the movie, is captivating because of the modern time frame it is attributed to. It is a world that shows how far human choice and capability can easily take society down the wrong path, yet at the same time the two can give people the strength to revolt against the unrighteous. <br/><br/>As political and mentally questionable as the film is, it is still a good time to spend at the movies. Yes, the dialogue can be cheesy at times, but for the most part try to look for the underlying meanings of the topics the movie tries to project. As for the acting, Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are great in portraying their characters. Overall, V for Vendetta is a great cinematic experience which will definitely not be forgotten too quickly and one that may be mimicked in terms of subject matter by films to come. 9/10"
"nbitters","10","6","12","20 March 2006"," A wonderful movie that will make you wonder ""What if""
","When I first saw the trailer for this movie during the super bowl I didn't think it would be that interesting, but I was wrong. After watching a behind the scenes clip a few nights ago, I had to see it and I am extremely happy that I did. The movie goes along the lines of Brave New World, 1984 and Animal Farm, and takes an interesting look at the world of ""what if""... What if your country came under complete control of one man? What if every citizen gave into his control out of fear? What if one man's tortured past was the only way that he could see the totalitarian rule as a bad thing? And what if this one man was the only person that could change the world for the better? Beautifully filmed and magnificent dialogue moves this movie along. An underground cavern filled with priceless works of art that chronicles the world's history. And a man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask who outwardly shows no emotion, but with excellent lighting we see every emotion that he truly has. Probably one of the best ""what if"" movies I have seen in a long while. I highly recommend it to anyone that has truly wondered what the world might be life ""if""."
"shahabsandhu","10","6","12","19 March 2006"," excellent watch!
","V for Vendetta has ALL the elements of an excellent movie that should NOT be subjected to certain reviewers personal tastes. If you only like explosions and fighting sequences than go watch independence day and be happy. Or if you have 'fracist' tendencies than stick with the cowboy movies. This movie WILL provoke many. You'll either love this movie, or, you'll find it ridiculous.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is nothing like the trailer. I haven't read the book before so my critique is less biased even so.<br/><br/>The story line is very satirical and will make you think. There's an apparent political message that's strong and clear. The dialog and script are simply excellent and powerful. Camera work and lighting is just perfect. The movie itself is dark, serious and very poetic. Overall it's a work of art. If you're an open-minded intellectual viewer you'll love it.<br/><br/>As a consequence of taste, If you only aspire to speak one language and can't write a half decent creative essay :-)...this movie may not be for you."

","Well. I saw this movie last night. I was waiting to see it and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The main point of this film is to make people think about what starts a reaction of the citizens of a nation. I believe that it did a good job at it. While people are arguing that it is the ""power fighting the power,"" I think that it doesn't matter that it is the power that is saying this, just as long as it is said. After all, we have the freedom to at the moment, why not use it, at least up until the freedom is taken from us.<br/><br/>The main reason I liked this movie was the fact that it was interesting. It held my attention, and I wasn't squirming for three hours trying to get comfortable.<br/><br/>There are many many action movies that are made to simply entertain and basically to occupy (and waste) the audience's time. This story has plot and characters and a back story, and a future. And, most importantly, it opened the floor for discussion among friends, co-workers, and even strangers.<br/><br/>Although V was an anarchist, it doesn't advocate anarchism, to me. It advocated the need for the citizens of a country to be aware of it's leaders and what they are doing behind the doors of their offices with their cronies.<br/><br/>Another thing I enjoyed were three very beautiful songs. ""Bird Gerhl"" by Antony and the Johnsons, ""I Found a Reason"" by Cat Power, and ""Cry Me a River"" by Julie London. They are all very slow, pretty songs. It is a very interesting part of the score, as when i think of other movies with similar themes and their soundtracks. In my opinion it is a very strong departure from the fast paced theme of the movie (365 days in three hours!) and is a very interesting backdrop to the relationship of V and Evey.<br/><br/>Overall: good show!"

","One of many a memorable quote from this visually and mentally stimulating movie. I was expecting pure action likened to that of The Matrix Trilogy, however what I found was truly a masterpiece from the Wachowski Brothers. Totalitarian State in the near future, one man a possible 'Anti-Hero' (V{Hugo Weaving}) fights for the people along side a fabulous Evey(Natalie Portman). Breathtaking action sequences, awesome usage of bullet-time, two most memorable explosions (amongst the many), and the most peculiar kiss ever portrayed on the big screen. V For Vendetta truly has it all. Without giving away much of the storyline, V is an ex experiment gone well! He becomes a swashbuckling ""Guy Fawkes wannabe"" who in fact turns out the better of the original. Special appearance by Stephen Fry, Fabulous. No actor is left undeserved of applause in this fabulously made action/thriller/everything!"

","When Margaret Thatcher, the Iron Lady, came to power in England, it was the trigger for that Alan Moore created a comic in a futuristic reality where a totalitarian power takes charge of the country using tactics of censorship, repression, based violence torture, persecution, and have full control of the media, especially television, and also the military. In the comics, the story was defined as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, as the story of the film was changed by the Wachowski sisters to fit in the modern political context<br/><br/>As in the original work, the political bias that permeates the whole plot has never been so high and the current before the communist and oppressive governments with his people, as we see in North Korea under Kim Jong-un command, or Cuba dominated ago long by the Castro family, or the government of Nicolas Maduro, leader of the successor populist Hugo Chavez in Venezuela.<br/><br/>James McTeigue works with the script and can also extract good performances from his cast, even if at times the film accelerates and leaves little time for the performances stand out. Hugo Weaving is impeccable. V is a mysterious man of great culture and is moved by two feelings: vengeance - acquired from an experiment that is being revealed gradually - and freedom from the oppressors. His mask even refers to another ""terrorist"" English Guy Fawkes who tried to blow up the English Parliament in 1605. Even without showing his face even once throughout the film, the actor, after standing out as Agent Smith in Matrix trilogy, V embodies masterfully. With no chance to show their facial expressions, Weaving shows a repertoire of body language and vocal intonations used in full measure. The powerful voice can pass all the feelings of the character, even without seeing their real expression behind the mask. The actor makes it a more romantic character that the graphic and gives credibility to inevitable attraction between him and Evey.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman as Evey Hammond, who developed both the English accent as the character itself, is at first of innocence and fragility to even the heaviest scenes of torture in certain evident moment of the film. It's an interesting character who undergoes a real transformation over the year that goes the plot of the story. On a fragile girl to a strong woman ready to fight against tyranny established in his country. John Hurt as Adam Sutler, the high chancellor, brings us the perfect figure of a dictator, clearly inspired by Hitler. His speeches full of hatred, intolerance and who is willing to have more and more power in society, combating all to think of opposing their government reveal all its instability and intolerance - even only seen via video, its strength and They can pass the necessary threat.<br/><br/>Another point we should highlight is the visual composition of the film. The photographer Adrian Biddle knows transmit a Darkest weather, gloomy, using more monochromatic palettes, through the idea of ​​a nation dominated, trapped and suffering from the domain of an austere government. This climate also won all the appropriate treatment on the soundtrack to Dario Marianelli. His music is present almost all the time and know how to grow in moments of tension and excitement.<br/><br/>A government that imprisons, tortures and kills blacks and homosexuals; eliminates any trace of culture, such as music, film and visual arts; and manipulates the people through the media. References to Hitler and the Nazi regime are not coincidental. ""V for Vendetta"" is clearly a government oppression of allegory, not only in societies of fascist / communist governments, but also in governments societies regarded as democratic, that use democracy as a mere instrument for the seizure of power. Are governments with communist characteristics that wish to impose political censorship and opinions, who want to end the freedom of the press, imposing control of the internet and media in general, and not abdicate of being in power, not accepting the democratic alternation of power. And above all, governments are urging the speech separatist hatred and class struggle, inciting the poor against the rich, us against them, black against white, civilians against military and so on.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" does not shy when dealing with controversial issues, such as homosexuality, pedophilia enter the Catholic Church, totalitarianism, Islamophobia and terrorism. His controversial story and the themes have been the target of criticism and praise from sociopolitical groups. Libertarians use the film's ideas as a conservative statement against government intervention in the lives of citizens. Anarchists propagate political theory of anarchism.<br/><br/>McTeigue is keen not to highlight the spectacular action. There are enough scenes of this nature throughout the film, all very well choreographed and impressive. Especially the fast and precise movements V, especially by showing a skilled wielder knives. However, some scenes are very exaggerated, as the struggle of the masked hero against the men of Creedy. The scenes of the explosion of parliament and the invasion of TV station also worth mentioning, as well as the torture scenes, especially those that told the letter of Valerie, through sensitive and poetic scenes that demonstrate the persecution and repression of homosexuals in general.<br/><br/>Note easily in this work that ""V for Vendetta"" is much more than a simple adaptation of a comic book to film. It is a questing work, eloquently and with an enormous symbolic power, historical depth and context, a brand present in the works of Alan Moore. The film knows how to offer the highest quality entertainment, able to combine entertainment, ideas and reflection to fully satisfactorily. The mask used by V has become a symbol, but it is even necessary to mask we cause a revolution? To what extent the society we live in has traces of that oppressive government of his people?"
"travisyoung","7","4","7","9 October 2007"," V for Vindictive?
","What happens when the politics of a movie overpower what is otherwise a moving, relevant, and even (at times) beautiful message? <br/><br/>Everyone tries SO hard here...Portman becomes wonderfully cockney, Weaving emotes mystery and power with every gesture and head tilt, and Hurt channels Hitler and any other tyrannical dictator with a frightening authenticity and ferocity--this film shares with us by far the best performances of their careers. Technically speaking, ""V"" is better made than any other film in the past 3 years, and much, much better than other Wachowski/Silver collaborations (read: the Matrix trilogy). Throw in what is a perfectly twisted plot, and what we SHOULD have is a movie catapulted to every top 10 list for the next 20 years, right? <br/><br/>Well...not so much. You see, intolerance of the intolerant is very dangerous, especially when the filmgoing public wants to be entertained, not indoctrinated. Buried beneath the faux message of love and acceptance, behind the flashy special effects, Panavision gloom, and the painful smile of a ghastly Guy Fawkes mask is a hatred more malignant than anything Hollywood or comic books could ever dream up. This film teaches that learning to hate is how we learn to love, that vengeance is the only way to achieve justice, that fear of anything--including God--is akin to torture. Democracy begets war, Christianity begets terrorism, and freedom may only be found through Anarchy in the world according to V.<br/><br/>One question: is that a world where you want to live?"
"Denicio_Del_Toro","4","4","7","19 February 2007"," Well constructed, but completely misses the point.
","Although the production and performances are generally good, I believe the writers of this film neutered what could have been a major work.<br/><br/>The original (comic-book) material deals with the power of ideas, both good and bad, and most particularly how easily a modern state could slip back into the fascism of the last century. Such an occurrence requires the collusion, albeit unwitting, of the population at large. However, the Wachowskis' film is about a conspiracy and a British people kept down only by the force of arms. The number of 'film school 101' shots of members of the public watching propaganda broadcasts and proclaiming them lies ignores the lessons of the past, and the intent of the writer of the original story. Nations were, and could again be, led into fascism by a small group only if the rest of the people were willing to accept this. The majority of the people of Europe in the 20's, 30's, and 40's knew about at least some of what was going on, if not the scale of it, and chose to look the other way, at least until light was shone on the horrors by the Allies. Modern neo-fascist groups thrive on the same denial of the evidence.<br/><br/>I realise the difficulties of adapting previously published work to the screen; virtually every aspect needs to be a candidate for modification, interpretation or removal. However, a successful adaptation must maintain the original intent of the work (I believe William Goldman said as much in one of his excellent works on the screen trade). I am afraid that the creators of V For Vendetta have failed in that respect."

In the end though one has to only watch 15 minutes of this movie to realise that here too it is a wronged and righteous man who is the hero and not two faced and contradictory icon as the promos so blatantly proclaim. Matrix worked because it had no political touch to it . It was rather a strong indictment of the fast moving and busy modern machine like existence of the humans. V on the other hand is laced with biased western sympathetic notions and goes beyond all decent limits to defend them.And all this while claiming that it is up to the viewer to interpret it's meaning. Frankly speaking it has been one of the disappointing movies that i've ever seen.

","I feel terrible! Everyone keeps talking about how great this movie is, and I didn't care for it. Did I miss something? I'm serious. I loved the Matrix, but I thought this was boring. I was really annoyed by the fact that V imprisoned Evey, and as upset and ready to die as she was, as soon as she found out it was a ploy to break her by V, all of a sudden she was happy about it? That makes no sense. I'm really interested to know why this movie was so great. I'm not trying to bash it at all. I think I must have missed something. Could someone please tell me what I am missing so I can love this movie too?

"Agita","3","7","15","9 October 2006"," V is for Vapid
","There's a whole lot of talking going on here, pontificating, and posturing. This is an action movie that wants to be overly dramatic and high brow...I suppose there's nothing inherently wrong with those aspirations, it's just the film should have worried about that AFTER it was entertaining.<br/><br/>One of the reasons the film dragged so much for me was that V wears a mask. Darth Vader wore a mask, and he was a great villain, but he didn't go on in every scene wanking on and on about what was bugging him and why it should bug you too...no...no...he was out there blowing up things and getting upset about losing the Death Star plans. He was easy to understand, whereas V is a chatty Cathy whose eyes we can't see, whose face is hidden from view...it's a bit of a disconnect. It's easy to understand what he's mad about, it's also impossible to understand why he just won't shut up and do something about it.<br/><br/>Portman's accent was distracting, and that's being kind. The world has gotten so small, if looking for a British actress, get one for crying out loud - it's not like they're hard to find. Same goes when casting American roles, please - enough of Colin Farrel and his bogus American accent - that has nothing to do with Vendetta, but while I was on the subject.<br/><br/>The film looks beautiful, it looks like it should be exciting...but at the end of the day, it was a chatter fest with a few explosions. Before anyone gets on a high horse about how a chatter fest can unearth some important ideas...this one digs up one or two childishly simple ideas up and proceeds to beat them into dust before your very weary eyes.<br/><br/>It's easy to see how one would want to take the book, and paste it's story over current events in an effort to make a statement. But most statements worth listening to aren't cut and paste - they're tailor made from the fabric of frustration. This is cut and past and bent and ripped CAUSING frustration.<br/><br/>The fact is that this film's over simplification of problems and trying to tie it into real world events is simple minded and irresponsible.<br/><br/>I wanted to drop a safe on V's head...just for a few laughs. You will too."
"yann-echelard","2","7","15","7 October 2006"," Overrated
","Trite idea, poor execution. Not much originality in describing a fascist future for Britain (""1984"" comes to mind....). This movie does not have much bite. Still it could be enjoyed as a pointless exercise of style (like ""Batman""), but it does not create a compelling imagery and it misses badly in some areas. One glaring mistake is the use of Natalie Portman, probably a fine actress, but she can't fake a British accent. Since she has to carry much of the movie (after all the other main character is masked) this is a major problem. Overall the movie comes out as fake and pompous. ""Robocop"" was much more successful in its attempt to use science fiction to comment on current events and politics, and much more entertaining."

","V for Vainglorious, more like.<br/><br/>This film was awful - every moment, every frame. Oh sure, it looked great, and being a serious progressive, its politics (worn with prejudice on its sleeve) were spot-on. But that's hardly enough as a sum-total artistic/movie experience. 20,000 miles from enough.<br/><br/>My problems? The dialogue - atrocious. The story - vapid. The characters - beyond V (and the screenwriter's ""Hey I know big words and I bet if I string enough of them together it'll sound real intelligent-like!"" tendencies re: V's monologues), utterly forgettable. (And that's saying something, considering Stephen Rea and John Hurt were in the cast. If you can waste them, you can waste anything.) The cinematography - gorgeous. The music - wretched, and then some. The politics - like I say, spot-on, but delivered with all the grace of a skyscraper- dropped anvil. The mask - fantastic. And the day you find a mask that carries a film all by itself, please, let me know, because this sure wasn't that film.<br/><br/>I absolutely abhor movies these days; V is a shining example of why. In a nutshell, it's artless, soulless, graceless, and not in the least possession of anything magical about movies. This movie was made 22 years ago, and it was called 1984, and it also starred John Hurt, and it was directed by Michael Radford; see 1984, and stay away from this stinking rubbish.

"manny_wilco","4","7","15","16 August 2006"," Wasted opportunity
","Yet again, the Wachowski brothers have proved to us that they can't write a decent screenplay. The original Matrix movie is looking more and more like a fluke with each film they unleash upon the unsuspecting public.<br/><br/>First of all, the script is awful. The dialogue is forcedand unnatural. The first words a shocked Natalie Portman says to V are ""Are you like a crazy person?"". Later, upon being brutally tortured for several months, her initial reaction is ""...you cut my hair!"". The rest of the movie consists of V endlessly spouting his ideology and delivering snappy one liners to use in promotional material (""people should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people"" ""behind this mask is an idea, and ideas are bulletproof"", etc). The writers for some reason found it necessary to make V explain every single thing he does, and why he does it. Everything. is. spelled. out.<br/><br/>The script is not really helped by the acting. Natalie Portman has once again shown the world that she has very little talent. She delivers her typical wooden performance, made even worse by her unfortunate English accent. She reeks of self-consciousness. She doesn't have what it takes to carry an entire movie. She should stick to supporting roles, or even better, go do something useful with her Harvard degree that she's so proud of. Why they didn't get an English actress is beyond me, it's not like there's a shortage. Hugo Weaving is excellent as always, but it's sad when someone acting through a mask can out-emote someone without. Stephen Rea is decent, but instantly forgettable. I don't know how to describe it other than saying it's a 'nothing' performance. I couldn't take Steven Fry seriously, but that's probably because I'm not used to him taking on dramatic roles. Same problem with Ben Miles. John Hurt did a good job with an irritating and badly written part. He isn't much more than an angry man on a screen.<br/><br/>I'm not bothered that it isn't an action film, even though it was marketed as one. What does bother me though are the action scenes that are in: they feel like an afterthought, as if they've been randomly inserted at the last minute. The final fight scene (out of 2) is awkward and bland, and completely illogical. It also involves a truly horrible knife-bullet-time. The Wachowski's must realise that's the only reason anyone really likes them. After being shot several times, V is completely fine and still able to take on 10 or so men. This is justified by the corny bulletproof line.<br/><br/>Apparently the makers think they are artistic, as demonstrated by the various badly done and, again, illogical 'metaphors' inserted throughout the film. Possibly my favourite involves V, on the eve of his revolution, setting up a giant metaphorical domino arrangement, then knocking it down to reveal his name. Trailer moment, anyone? Other brilliant moments involve Natalie Portman stretching her arms out in the rain, intercut with V doing the same in fire, and dead people being alive with a voice-over explaining why they are still alive (nice and abstractly though). These truly moronic moments, while not making the film seem any smarter, at least add some comic relief. The real attempts at comic relief are bizarre if anything, namely a scene in which V is wearing a pink frilly apron.<br/><br/>Possibly the biggest flaw in the film is that the totalitarian government isn't bad at all. It doesn't make sense that everyone would want a revolution. It's fair enough that V wants revenge for personal reasons, there aren't actually much politics behind his actions. But for the everyday people, life isn't so terrible (as far as the viewer knows). The general public seems to consist of 2 wholesome suburban families, living in nice modern houses with big flat screen TV's. The most terrifying thing about this government, on a day to day basis, is that the news channels aren't very reliable. As long as you don't have a secret room full of Qu'rans and S&M pictures, you'll be fine. For ""An uncompromising vision of the future"" it's pretty damn tame. <br/><br/>The sets are bland, and the entire thing has that BBC-TV-Movie feel. The cinematography is bland, with the exception of one cool shot of V jumping off a building. The music is bland, the lighting is bland, the direction is bland. It doesn't feel like a whole lot of love went into making this.<br/><br/>It's not all bad though. The film is at least entertaining, and it only drags in a few places. It just doesn't know what it wants to be. It half-heartedly swings between trying to be a social commentary and trying to be an action film. The only thing that links it as a whole is that it thinks it's more intelligent than it is. The R rating is completely wrong. V for Vendetta seems to be written for people aged 14 and under. The totalitarian government isn't really very totalitarian. It is dystopia-lite, and the more complex themes are simplified and over-explained. The viewer is talked down to throughout. If the Wachowski's wanted to be taken seriously with this, which they clearly did, they should have taken the audience more seriously.<br/><br/>It's a pity, this movie could have been excellent. With a stronger script (much stronger), a more interesting director, and a competent leading lady, it could have become a classic. As it is, it's an exercise in mediocrity, and a cowardly take on a controversial issue."

","V for Vendetta V for Vendetta takes place in the near future (2020) in London, England. After disengaging itself from a ""war America started,"" terror attacks  including an horrific biological attack that killed thousands  have resulted in a totalitarian government there. Using tools ranging from strictly enforced curfews to surveillance cameras, and from ""disappearing"" political activists to government-controlled news outlets, Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) is firmly in control. That control is exercised, of course, for the security and good of England's citizens.<br/><br/>A man known only as V (Hugo Weaving) disagrees. His stance against the Chancellor's government is two-fold: he hates what the government has done to him personally, and he loves freedom. In a series of violent attacks he personally orchestrates, he sets out to prove his point to the largely oblivious population.<br/><br/>Through no real fault of her own, a young woman named Evey (Natalie Portman) meets the mysterious masked V in a dark alley where V saves her virtue from a trio of government-appointed citizen informers (aptly called ""fingermen""). Employed by a government television station, Evey doesn't occupy a place of authority but is positioned quite well enough to know that the news anchors often must relay stories that they personally know to be untrue.<br/><br/>Evey's knowledge is only further cemented when the newscasters try to pretend that some explosions the night before were the result of a planned demolition. It's also more than enough to make her fear that a visit from the state police could be targeting her. In reality, however, it's not her the police are after. It's V himself.<br/><br/>V is at the television station this November 5 to claim responsibility for a bombing as well as to challenge the people of London to join him on the following November 5  Guy Fawkes' Day  to destroy Parliament itself. V only narrowly escapes the police who are there to arrest him, and again by accident, Evey gets involved.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the ongoing machinations of the Chancellor and his minions serve to show just how far a tyrant will go to hold on to power. But when the anguish of Evey's friend, Deitrich (Stephen Fry) and a woman she'll never meet (Valerie, played by Natasha Wightman) offer a heart-rending counterpoint from the other side, Evey isn't the only one whose loyalties and motivations are conflicted! <br/><br/>Natalie Portman proved she can really act in her superlative turn in 2004's Closer. She stays at that level here. Hugo Weaving's face is never seen, but his voice alone is terrifying, poignant, and powerful by turns. The supporting cast is also very good, particularly Stephen Fry who offers up a wonderful rendering of a publicly resigned man who slowly lets his own disillusionment grow into some brave action of his own.<br/><br/>Though much touted as being a movie from the same men who brought us the brilliant Matrix series, in reality the Wachowski brothers are responsible for the screenplay alone (they're also credited as producers). Director James McTeigue is instead behind the cameras here, and he ably brings a complicated story to life.<br/><br/>The sets are spectacular and the effects even more so. But I maintain that it's the story itself that makes V for Vendetta as impressive as it is. I really enjoyed my movie-going experience simply from the standpoint of suspense and entertainment; but what really got to me was the view of the near future and its horrifying plausibility. Though I had a hard time divorcing the two points for myself, I can tell you that my friend's 17 year-old son and a buddy saw V for Vendetta this weekend as well, and neither has shut up about it since. They don't care anything about politics, and yet they both loved it. So did I.<br/><br/>POLITICAL NOTES: There is literally no moment of this film that doesn't have a political impact.<br/><br/>In the movie, political activists are watched and sometimes punished; in America today, we know that, at a minimum, many are surveilled. On screen, we see ""for your safety"" extolled by government officials; today, more than a few laws, including the freedom-stealing PATRIOT Act, are based on those very notions. In the film, ""fingermen"" are everywhere to report on their fellows; today, we've been encouraged to do the same, up to and including the infamous TIPS program.<br/><br/>There are many more parallels to name, and most of them are at least as awful as the few listed above. V for Vendetta takes place in the near future, and impossible to watch the movie, as enjoyable as it is, without wondering just how ""near"" that future really is. Perhaps an early warning can help us avoid the nasty fate  as well as the very violent ultimate release from that fate  depicted in the movie. And while V for Vendetta is certainly not a movie to be taken literally, there's some very real and legitimate early warning here that I personally believe should be heeded.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: V for Vendetta is rated R for ""strong violence, (and) some language."" This is not a movie suitable for young children either in its overall topic or its rendering. From its opening scenes of the execution of Guy Fawkes in 1605 to the penultimate (beautifully choreographed, I might add) fight, the blood and guts are fairly graphic. In addition, everything from Shakespeare to classic movies are quoted or somehow otherwise involved, and the politics is sometimes complicated in and of itself. This is not a film for the faint of heart or those unable to understand such vocabulary or ideals. But for the rest, whether they consider V a terrorist or a freedom fighter in the end, there's so much of thought-provoking value here that I'm inclined to consider V for Vendetta required viewing."
"dittrick63","1","18","49","17 March 2006"," Highly symbolic but hate full and not accurate
","This movie was written with multiple layers of symbolism. Natalie Portman was the only genuine person in the movie. Most of the rest of the actors were persona's to be despised and hated. They were dehumanized. This was a highly political movie, as I would expect from a Moore. Although this movie was set in England it was clearly about the U.S. The major themes are 1) anti Bush. He is compared to Hitler and accused of running a concentration camp (abu grave) where the bird flue is created to kill Americans so he can consolidate his power. 2) Anti Christian. In addition to calling catholic priests pervert pedophiles Christians are portrayed as hate full supporters of Bush. Specifically a lesbian is taken to a concentration camp. Good Christians would be sickened by her treatment. 3) Anti Democracy/pro terrorism. The movie starts out blowing up a statue of the woman with the scales of justice and ends destroying British parliament building. The hero (sic) of the movie is a subtly veiled suicide bomber. You could spend a long time analyzing the themes and symbols. I didn't like it and I don't recommend it."

","Dear Larry and Andy Wachowski, I want my money back.

The product you delivered was certainly G For Garbage, and the ""hero"" you offered in the movie was the bastard child of MTV, Osama Bin Laden and Michael Moore. Instead of taking a few liberties with the plot as most movies based on comics do, you felt it necessary to rewrite the entire story. This was certainly NOT the V For Vendetta I remember reading and re-reading. This was, simply put, one of the most dumbed-down pieces of garbage put on film I've seen in recent memory.

"cdelacroix1","2","9","21","17 March 2006"," Amazingly Bad Social Commentary Flick
","I went to see this movie this afternoon ... opening day here ... and was very, very disappointed.<br/><br/>So disappointed that I left the theatre after waiting for an hour for things to improve. I almost never walk out of a movie. But it was really that bad this time. And I wasn't alone. It was a late afternoon showing, and the rows I was sitting in ... up front (I always like sitting up front) included just 3 other folks. All seated separately. The other 3 had all walked out before I did.<br/><br/>There were two basic features of the movie that really moved it into the almost utterly awful category for me.<br/><br/>One was the figure of V himself. Hugo Weaving's vocalization of the character as far as I could tell was fine; but V and the script built around V were amazingly bad. V is sort of a Zorro with a soft, urbane English accent, and a Mask that seems incongruously similar to that used in the Halloween movie series, and a penchant for quoting Shakespeare. He's sort of a wimpy Bard spouting wisdom and culture and death and murder and revolution in such winning tones that we're apparently supposed to be as captivated as his audience by him. When he appears on TV, the movie shows several scenes of The Common Man, Woman, and Child, watching and listening with rapt mesmerized attention to a vividly unappealing super hero with soft, wimpy tones and patronizing metro-sexual language that I just can't imagine The Great British Nation ... or the Great Any Nation ... finding so deeply appealing. I found especially obnoxious the repeated scenes in an English pub, with several working class blokes staring mesmerized at this clown spouting faux Shakespeare. Instead of cracking jokes and mockery at such (to use a term often used in other connections) Bollux.<br/><br/>The other feature of the movie that rendered it extraordinarily unpleasant from my angle was its ham-fisted social commentary that boiled down to: Terrorism is just Another Name for Legitimate Resistance to Tyranny. In this day and age, that kind of moral equivalence is unusual mostly in its poor taste in this movie: to make the obvious even more obvious, there's a scene where the Natalie Portman character goes into a room full of the most amazing political kitsch and finds it Oh So Meaningful. So we see a portrait of a Union Jack titled ""Coalition of the Willing"" with a Nazi banner across it; and a picture of Margaret Thatcher (I think?) bowdlerized to evidently reflect some mockery that we're supposed to applaud. The Regime is composed of Bishops, Clergy, and other figures of Faith who are all Bad (one Bishop's fondness for under-aged females makes a particularly nasty scene) and other Evil People. I don't mind at all social commentary but when it's this ham-fisted and this silly it becomes to me just coarse and silly and stereotyped. It makes me feel like I'm watching an old propaganda film out of the old Nazi or Communist ""Socialist Realism Theatre"" days. Above all, though, the repeated vision of Terrorism as meaning Justice in Action is to me deeply offensive in these days after 9/11 and other such horrible tragedies. I think even Guy Fawkes ... the nasty real-life English terrorist on whom V is supposedly modeled ... must be rolling in his grave at such nonsense.<br/><br/>Acting was decent but unexceptional, cinematography competent but uninteresting ... there was one sort of interesting scene early on from a London rooftop. Other than that, though, the script was just so horribly dismal as to make this a truly and amazingly bad movie."
"jam4","1","10","24","23 March 2006"," Why do the Wachowskis still get work?
","If you've read and enjoyed ""V for Vendetta""-- or pretty much any other work by Alan Moore-- then you should find this film bordering on insulting. It comes as no surprise to me that Mr. Moore refused to allow his name to be attached to the movie. Only V's costume and one small portion of the entire movie remain true to the original work. The Wachowskis saw fit to rewrite almost everything else.<br/><br/>None of the characters in the movie, including the titular V, have the personality traits ascribed to them in the book. V comes off as silly and melodramatic, rather than calculating and coldly efficient. Where he should sound like a meticulous madman, he instead seems entirely rational. Evey starts the film as a strong character, already harboring rebellious notions against the government. This is in complete opposition to the broken-spirited young woman of the novel.<br/><br/>Even disregarding its poor adaptation of the original work, the script is poorly written and full of holes. Evey time we get a look at the common man, in the movie, they already seem to be opposed to the corrupt government. If this is the case, there's no rhyme or reason for V to exist; civil unrest will spark on its own. And in regards to that, why did everyone seem so opposed to the government? Evey time we get a look at the common man, they are sitting in a clean home with a loving family, watching the news on a multi-thousand dollar High Definition Television. It seems as if everyone is happy and successful; why would they want to rebel against that? The movie's ending is the perfect example of its poor writing. Everything wraps up impossibly cleanly with a fairy-tale ""happily ever after"" type conclusion that simply does not fit the atmosphere of the story.<br/><br/>While the acting is actually quite good, and the cinematography has been well-achieved, the horrible script simply ruins this film."
"Charliesbistro","1","10","24","19 March 2006"," Zorro+Running Man=V for Vendetta
","I gave this film a 1/10 just to offset the 10/10 reviews. My real rating would probably fall between a 4-5/10. That being said, this film was a huge disappointment for me. I kind of expected the creators of the ""Matrix"" series to come up with a challenging, densely layered plot, but instead I was subjected to the cookie-cutter, paper thin plot structures that appear in nearly every big budget ""blockbuster"" movie. My girlfriend and I were actually laughing about halfway through the movie because we could easily point out what was going to happen next. Hugo Weaving phones in his performance, as he curtseys and makes gentlemanly gestures from behind his mask, and Natalie Portman is far from believable. The media buzz prior to this film's release was that it raised controversial questions about terrorism and how the government tries to manipulate society, but the film spends so much time ramming this dystopian future down your throat, that it makes it less and less believable. The pseudo nazi imagary is far too contrived, and instead of right wing pundits being up in arms over this movie, they'll probably have a field day discrediting anyone drawing comparisons to the Bush administration. ""V for Vendetta"" could have been a powerful film that sent an important message, but its creators opted for the action-sequence ""blockbuster"" instead. I'm not familiar with the graphic novel, but it must be better than this."
"riskbreaker113","1","10","24","17 March 2006"," Huge Disappointment
","Ever since I'd first heard that V for Vendetta would be made into a film, I was extremely excited. Alan Moore's story is outstanding and I figured, with Sin City finally showing people how to make a comic book movie (you just transform cells into shots, it's that easy folks), the film version would do the graphic novel justice.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film completely misses the mark and arbitrarily changes some plot points. First of all, the director tries too hard to draw a parallel between Evey's and V's actions. When I say 'tries too hard' I mean that the editing comes off as heavy handed and basically interferes with the story by drawing too much attention to itself. Second, the plot was heavily reworked. I can understand the need to take out some characters in order to make the movie an acceptable length time-wise. What I can't understand is the arbitrary plot changes. The opening scene is completely ruined, in my mind. Evey is not out as a prostitute, which completely changes the feel of the movie, and rather than dispatching the fingermen in the manner from the book, V simply fights them in an utterly conventional scene. Come on, what was the point of these changes? Also, why did they remove the colorful lexicon of Moore's universe? What happened to the Nose or the Ears of the Mouth? In the graphic novel, I interpereted this as a creative adaption of Orwellian ministry names but apparently the screenwriter didn't agree. I can forgive that. However, it doesn't make sense that the police officers are called fingermen if the corresponding ministry isn't called the Hands. I can't forgive this lack of internal consistency. <br/><br/>However, these are all minor quibbles when I consider the fact that they took out Finch's acid trip. THAT'S ONE OF THE BEST PARTS OF THE ENTIRE STORY! Finch, somehow complicit with genocide, empathizing with the people he could not, or would not, protect. Finch putting himself in V's skin in order to find and stop him. Finch hunting down a terrorist who's actions he supports on a subconscious level. Removing this vital part of the story not only compromised the role of Finch's character but also showed just how cowardly Hollywood really is. An acid trip is still taboo outside the confines of 'Fear and Loating'...<br/><br/>In the end, the film has a few effective monologues but overall, falls well short of the mark simply because it doesn't tell this complex story, with its many characters, particularly well or coherently. Bluntly, the pacing was all wrong. Every scene was rushed just so the film could fit into that 132 minutes window. Honestly, I would have preferred a 180 minutes film that satisfied the narrative elements of Moore's novel then this abridged nonsense. Now that I think about it, there are only two things wrong with this movie; it is abridged (the order of events switched around and subplots removed) and gutless (Portman could get tortured but could no be a prostitute?, Genocide is acceptable material - LSD is no laughing matter :("

","If Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who shot up Columbine High, were still alive, ""V for Vendetta"" would be their favorite movie. Never has a mainstream film so romanticized the grandiosity, the narcissism, the petulant grudge holding, the anal sadism, and the infantile paranoia that make up the terrorist personality. <br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" *is* marketing despicable ideas, but it's doing so in a flatfooted fashion. Director James McTeigue and the Wachowski brothers, who wrote the script, are not Leni Riefenstahl; unlike that Nazi master, they don't know how to make their evil ideas cunningly attractive or interesting. <br/><br/>The plot: authority figures like medical doctors, TV newsmen, politicians, and cops, are all really, really bad. Now there's a plot device that every immature seventeen year old who is convinced that his parents and teachers are out to get him will applaud. <br/><br/>There's only one really good hero out there, and he's showing how good he is by blowing things up, and, along the way, torturing a beautiful young woman. Wow! That immature seventeen year old is going to love that plot device. His urges to destroy, and hurt pretty girls, are actually virtuous? Wow. Let's give this movie a ten. <br/><br/>For much of ""V for Vendetta,"" you are watching other people watch TV. When the filmmakers want to tell you that there is a scary government-manufactured virus on the loose, they don't actually dramatize that; rather, they show a man looking up old newspaper articles about a scary government-manufactured virus. This is such inept, and such incredibly boring, film-making that the mind reels, and the eyes look at the watch.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" tries to stage awesome images of fascists on the march, but there was only enough cash in the kitty to cast and costume about twenty or so fascists, which is less awesome than pathetic. ""V for Vendetta""'s big, scary special FX is mostly poor John Hurt's very bad teeth magnified to six feet high. ""V for Vendetta""'s fomenting of hatred against persons with bad dental work is shameful. <br/><br/>Even the action scenes are boring to the point of being inadvertently funny. V rescues a woman from evil police officers. And then he just stands there stiffly, spouting a boring soliloquy in which every other word starts with the letter V. I could hear people walking out at that point. <br/><br/>Ed Norton did much better work as the masked leper, Baldwin, in ""Kingdom of Heaven."" Norton must have studied how to make tiny body movements convey expression, even though his face was covered by a mask. Hugo Weaving offers no such acting talent. When you are looking at him, you are looking at a piece of immobile plastic. If nothing else, the cinematographer could have lit the mask in an interesting way. But that would have taken talent, and when you can blow things up, who needs talent? <br/><br/>Comic book movies are supposed to be unbelievable, but this one sets a new low. In an oppressive fascist state, a costumed crusader is able to walk unimpeded into government offices and the private homes of top leaders. Come on. These filmmakers aren't George Orwell. Their dystopia is about as scary as a hangnail. <br/><br/>Let's run through the movie's main ideas, either stated or suggested: 1.) AIDs is a government-manufactured virus. 2.) The US is the world's greatest threat to peace. 3.) Terrorism is the only way to make a contribution to society, because the people in charge are so evil and corrupt that there is no other way to contribute anything positive. So, oh, say, teaching children to read or working at a hospice or being an investigative reporter who gets to the bottom of corruption, or doing anything that requires patience or training or self discipline - that's just so uncool. 4.) Christians are really, really, really bad people. The Nazi swastika was not a pagan symbol; it was really just a Christian cross. Christian leaders have sex with child prostitutes. 5.) Islam is really friendly to homosexuals, and homosexuals run to Islam as a refuge from evil, oppressive Christians. 6.) Film footage we have seen of hostages taken by Islamic terrorists is really just dramatizations invented by our government in order to get us to hate Islam, so that we don't hate whom we really should be hating - Christians. 7.) 9-11 was really orchestrated by the American government. 8.) Terrorists are incredibly sweet and sensitive guys who rescue damsels in distress, recite Shakespeare, and have a connoisseur's appreciation of films from the Hollywood Golden Age. 9.) Terrorist acts are not so bad because no people die in them, they create beautiful fireworks, and they are a good excuse to listen to Tchaikovsky. <br/><br/>You get the idea. No, the movie doesn't say many of the above things directly, but it implies them. There is a government invented virus, there are government invented hostage tapes, there are homosexuals who are oppressed by Christians and turn to Islam, etc. <br/><br/>It's exhausting trying to catalogue the ironies that abound in this film. Here's just one: the film claims that it is all about protesting fascism, but the film's climax involves a celebration of individuals surrendering their individuality and acting as a faceless, violent mob. Folks, that's what fascism is. You could look it up. <br/><br/>Another irony: George Bush and his mistakes do need to be interrogated. But criticisms like this, which childishly and hysterically equate Bush with Hitler, give real criticism a bad name."

On a similar note, at the end of the film, the houses of parliament get blown up, in the novel its downing street. <br/><br/>> The Entire Plot! - The film spends time prattling on about viruses and what not, the novel is concerned with a fascist government.<br/><br/>Now before i start a flame war, i am aware of terms such as ""artistic license"" and the like, but this film is far from art.

Maybe that's why the guy has cut ties with anyone in Hollywood wanted to use his work for movies. This film was just another piece of Hollywood garbage that made the villains both Christian and Conservatives, granted that's what Moore did, but come on guys, pull a Luc Besson and maybe show a different type of villain. Of course, this aspect of the film tainted my viewing of it, as it hits you right away with blaming the United States with the evils of the world starting with Bush's war in Iraq. I'm not even sure I would have really liked it if it didn't have that.

Some of the other casting considerations (such as Scarlett Johannsen) I just don't have as much confidence in. And Hugo Weaving, although never seen on the screen (at least not his face), made a great V. It makes me sad that Alan Moore decided to preemptively disown this film, because unlike ""League of Extraordinary Gentleman"", this is a winner. (And I liked ""From Hell"", even if Moore didn't.)

"warren-1976","6","5","10","8 May 2007"," Ultimately Disappointing
","'V for Vendetta' is a mixed bag. It has a lot going for it, but is it enough? In the trend of 'totalitarian future government' movies, we are offered a vision of Britain where fear, along with religious and moral extremism, have created a world where everyday freedoms have been lost, and the population is controlled by an evil government.<br/><br/>Carrying on from such films and stories as '1984', 'Soylent Green', 'Equilibrium', the biggest problem with 'V for Vendetta', is that having been written in the 80s, its vision of a future Britain seems surprisingly quaint and out-of-date. Ironic, when films such as '1984' or 'Soylent Green' actually appear MORE relevant now. It is as though the Wachowski's (creators of the 'Matrix' trilogy) have added in Islamaphobia and terrorists to make it up-to-date, but forgotten to remove or update the elements that are OUT-of-date. Britain's public are already suffering under far more surveillance than the society of 'V for Vendetta'. That it would be controlled by extreme Christian fundamentalists, seems utterly unlikely, in a society that now ridicules and marginalises those with such beliefs.<br/><br/>There are other such marked elements, that simply stop the story ringing true. Were it to take the route of a film such as 'Equilibrium', using a fictional state, we could accept the differences. Being placed in a real country, it loses its credibility. Yet of course this story by its nature, MUST be set in Britain, and so should have been updated accordingly. The closest comparison would be 'Children of Men', which, while it has its own faults, does at least create a believable extrapolation of how British government and society could go. There are too many bad stereotypes in 'V for Vendetta', that betray its graphic novel roots, both visually, and story-wise. It is a shame that there is such a current trend for adapting comics and graphic novels. As a result, we are too often nowadays, treated to films that are visually intriguing, but ultimately lack the depth of much that has come before them.<br/><br/>The other primary drawback is much in line with 'The Matrix'. The Wachowski's (even though not directing this time) take an interesting premise and basic story, dress it up, then do little with it, masking the flaws with 'striking' visuals, or the like. Though admittedly, 'V for Vendetta' does not go down this route quite so markedly. The reason it probably didn't succeed as hoped, is because it didn't use the same trick as 'The Matrix', of covering its flaws with overly-exotic fight scenes. As such, it ironically makes for a better film, but less of a crowd pleaser.<br/><br/>The cast, for the most part, is pretty good. Hugo Weaving is functional, in a thankless role that doesn't allow him to do much, while Natalie Portman does her best, but unfortunately can't quite maintain a consistent British accent. Perhaps the most interesting, but undeveloped character, is the police officer who gradually pieces everything together. John Hurt chews the screen suitably in a limited role, but has an unfortunately lacklustre demise.<br/><br/>Overall, it is an interesting film, with at least a little depth to make you think. It'll pass a couple of hours, but ultimately leave you most likely a bit disappointed at the missed potential."
"drawoh","3","5","10","9 October 2006"," A thought-provoking, if superficial, entertainment.
","V for Vendetta is a fairly engaging entertainment which is hugely aided, in America, at least, by the questions it raises about civil liberties vs security. Hugo Weaving does a nice job of overcoming the mask with his voice and body language and a strong supporting cast of fine character actors outweigh a merely adequate performance by Natalie Portman. But the Brothers W let us down with a half-baked screenplay and the more you think about this movie the less good it is. Consider, in particular, V's ability to circumvent an enormous security infrastructure to assassinate top level officials in their homes at will, hijack a government train, acquire and distribute a half million Guy Fawkes masks, and stock his personal museum sanctuary with art treasures. How he does any of these things is seldom shown, and more often than not he simply tells us that he has done them. If you have never thought much about the political issues raised and this film causes you to do so, that's great. But it's far, far from a ""work of towering genius."" Marvelous explosion at the end, though."

","V for Vedetta, a terrible excuse for making a film. How could Alan Moore allow Hollywood to make a big budget Bush-era investiment and not have any control over it. Alan Moore, the writer and creator of V FOR Vendetta was not about America's governmental system or Republican-bashing-it was about Anarchy and Fascism! For God's sake, it was about England! I have no problem with Bush-bashing but this film makes it so hard to believe, what may seem to be a beautiful, intriguing sci-fi film about the Holocaust is actually a movie that's meant to get to the box office and not to the true core of emotion and thought that it was meant to be. V FOR VENDETTA is about the man in the mask, but the true men that should be wearing masks, my friends, is the makers of this film."

","I never dreamt that I would see a movie that would really open my eyes in a political way that ""V for Vendetta"" has. I think the film is symbolic of some peoples wants and desires when it comes down to governments like those we live under (George W. Bush), and others. I think it stands that ""V for Vendetta"" gives us a look at how many feel their lives are being directed under such governments, and I agree with it entirely. I also give this film credit to the fact that while it does mirror practices of the Third Reich, rather than show the general exploits of your typical group of minorities, such as Jews or Blacks, it finally brings out the struggles the gay community endured and still does in a way today. And that really won the film over for me along with it's other political sentiments. Very emotional, very deserving of an award."
"Hazbear","8","5","10","5 April 2006"," An Amazing journey
","Simply put, V for Vendetta is an amazing and challenging film. One wonders what Tony Blair would think of it - whether it is a glimpse of the future, made possible by Bush's war. The movie is set in the year 2020, where England is completely controlled in a dictatorship based on fear and submission by it's leader Adam Sutler(John Hurt in a Hitler-type role). The general population is kept under control by Sutler's Fingermen, pretty much criminals with a badge. Through the movie's intro, we discover that the rest of the world has succumbed to disease and chaos, and England has disassociated itself from Europe as the only ""free country"" left in the world. America is singled out as a ""diseased leper colony"" that has dissolved into civil war due to an international war they started years earlier (no guesses for which war that was). Into this world, we are introduced to Evey Hammond (played wonderfully by Natalie Portman - forget her performances in the dreadful Star Wars prequels, as here she excels). One night after a government imposed curfew, she is caught and almost raped by the Fingerman. To her rescue comes V, a masked vigilante who rescues her and transports her to safety. Evey is taken to V's secret compound, where we discover V's whereabouts and the reason for his Guy Fawkes mask, as well as his crusade for revolution. To go on would be to ruin the story for the curious, however, I must say that this movie was a breath of fresh air in a world of political (right wing) correctness. The performances in the movie are outstanding, particularly Hugo Weaving, who plays the neo-terrorist V. For a character who appears the entire movie in a mask, Weaving's voice and mannerisms provide all the personality and character you would expect from a fully faced actor. In fact in some of the scenes you forgot there is a mask at all.<br/><br/>Simply put. V for Vendetta is a fantastic film, which will make you question the world that is currently forming around us.<br/><br/>8.5/10 Hazman"
"johnnyboyz","5","5","10","4 April 2006"," P for Pathetic
","Comical, overblown, poorly written and a delicate subject given the 'Hollywood treatment'; all of these can be used to describe 'V for Vendetta'. The film kicks off far too early with the evilness surrounding the state thrown at our faces in a very sudden fashion. We aren't given any build up to Portman's character, nor to that of 'V' and as a result, it takes a lot longer for us to 'get to know' them as the film goes on. This twinned with the fact that when we should have been properly introduced, we're given a brief and rather ugly introduction to Guy Fawkes and the history surrounding him, obviously one for the Americans as anyone who has been to a November the 5th BBQ or fireworks party really doesn't need this sort of beginning, in fact the film would've benefited from more of a build up involving the corruption in the state and the past trauma's surrounding the main characters. As a result, we see this later on in the film  at the wrong time, emphasising the evidence that the film was written badly.<br/><br/>The initial incident of V and Evey meeting each other happens far too early on and the relationship between them dies a quick death between them meeting for the first and second times. The gap is just far too long. This is very disorientating as from then on, they are inseparable. Another example of the poor writing is where a 'mock' television programme episode is created by one of the characters. Clearly a suicidal act within the film world and a huge question mark is raised as to how much the writers really 'knew' their characters. 'Would he have really done that?' From this act of the mock TV programme being shown, the film twists down another road as this stupid, suicidal act propels the film forward and spawns a few extra events. I'm not giving too much away but there's a death, a kidnapping and a mini-twist within the narrative, all creating the ILLUSION of good film making and although it's directed well, the fact is that it should never have happened in the first place(!) The writers clearly ran out of ideas and realised the dead end they were heading down before coming up with this narrative revelation.<br/><br/>Another flaw in the writing is the dialogue. This is a very American film and was clearly written by the Americans, FOR the Americans. The script is clearly lacking in research as the British stereo-types flow out of here like water out of a power shower: thick and fast. Another thing is that English people don't say 'bollocks' in every other sentence when faced with an awkward/life threatening situation, they swear like every other person in the world and if you're writing for a 12-17 year old audience whilst at the same time keeping in the violence shown towards the end and of course, the element of terrorism which is obviously present then shame on you for not getting your priorities right. Yet again, an example of terrible writing and not any where near to what I expected from the Wachowski Brothers. The laughable monologue at the beginning of the film which used as many words as possible that begin with the letter 'V' was ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It was an obvious hint to what was to come.<br/><br/>I think the people who REALLY like this film are suffering, in some way, from some sort of brain washing. I think they've realised the Wachowski Brothers are involved, they've realised it's a comic book outing, which most people enjoy given success of films like Underworld, X-Men and Spider Man in recent years, they've realised that it's got a big cast and they've realised it's dealing with current affairs in the form of terrorism. Everything seems so perfect, when really it's very far from it.<br/><br/>What has happened here is the makers have cleverly set it away from America and in the pretty distant future, thus thinking that they have a bit of a license to overcook certain things and audiences have lapped up the fantasy. Little annoying things such as the fact V's face has the same expression on it over and over due to the mask he wears. This makes it very difficult to relate to the main character as we never even see him and I found it very difficult to motivate myself to even care for him. The poor casting of Stephen Fry, who emphasised the stereo typing with the accent and attitude of his character and the annoying invincibility that V seemed to have throughout the film. Things like this drag the film further down.<br/><br/>This wasn't spectacular in the cinema and will look even worse when it comes to the small screen.<br/><br/>One last thing is that 'Remember, remember the 5th of November' has got to be one of THE most annoying taglines in film history."

","This movie is one of the most powerful critiques of modern corruption, society, government hypocrisy and imminent abuse of unchecked, absolute power that I have ever experienced. Intellectually- and psychologically-shocking and deeply disturbing (as the Alien and Sedition Acts, along with the Patriot Act, become a terrifying reality within this fictitious setting), I hope it will be regarded as much more than a thoroughly-entertaining movie and heroic epic. Just imagine this toxic cocktail: rabid, dogmatic ideals of McCarthyism, the Third Reich (and perhaps, the War on Terror? hmm) rampant in the British government combined with the outcome at Guernica. And this time, biological arsenals (and once again, fear) are the weapons of choice to silence the voices of innocent citizens. God, what we do to our own species is unfathomable. Go see this movie, it will forever change your perspective on trust in the government, the media, the fine line between democracy and dictatorship and human rights. Note: Even if you're weak of heart or stomach, I recommend this movie to you. It was terribly hard for me to get through, as I am a highly empathetic person. Some of the scenes are pretty graphic, much like what you'd see at the Holocaust Museum, etc. However, this movie contains warnings that, while gruesome and mortifying, are more than just plausible conspiracies and are paramount for every inquisitive and yearning minds to consider."

Everything about this movie worked for me, which is incredible given what they accomplished in a little over two hours.<br/><br/>Most of my favorite films have several important themes mixed with an interesting plot and genuinely funny, dramatic and poignant moments. It's so refreshing to see a film not afraid to take chances and deal with issues that are so relevant to the world today. This film should be a screaming alarm to everyone who has become complacent in ANY government that cares nothing of the majority of their citizens.<br/><br/>Sadly, however, many may need more than what happened to V to finally realize what atrocities can occur when you do not stand up for love and justice. In any case, V for Vendetta is and will always be an unequivocal classic in my eyes, one I will show to my kids someday.<br/><br/>Oh, and the music V uses hasn't seen this great a day since Bill Murray blew up the golf course in Caddyshack.

","V for Vendetta explores one man's courage to stand up to a government that continues to isolate its constituency. Not unlike the Frodo character in Lord of the Rings, V is one insignificant human that inspires a nation and changes the course of its history. Hugo Weaving (The Matrix) plays the enshrouded V, who, within the course of a year turns the tide of a fascist and oppressive dictatorship. On a more symbolic level, the movie reminds viewers how seemingly insignificant violations of liberty can lead toward the consolidation of power.<br/><br/>On a historical note, one need only know a tad bit of British history to really appreciate the metaphor behind the lead character V.<br/><br/>The Facts: Guy Fawkes (April 14, 1570January 31, 1606) was an English soldier and a member of a group of Roman Catholic conspirators who attempted to carry out the so-called Gunpowder Plot in 1605. The plot was an attempt to assassinate King James I of England (James VI of Scotland) and the members of both houses of the Parliament of England. To do this, Westminster Palace was to be blown up during the formal opening session of the 1605 Parliament, in which the king would address a joint assembly of both the House of Lords and the House of Commons. Guy Fawkes was in large part responsible for the later stages of the plan's execution. His activities were detected, however, before the plan's completion. Following a severe interrogation involving the use of torture, Fawkes and his co-conspirators were executed for treason and attempted murder. Guy Fawkes is remembered with Guy Fawkes Night on November 5"

Where there will be a very thin line between a terrorist and those who acts to fulfill their idealism. The dialogs in this movie is just... sharp. Sure, there are many dialogs, but most of them will lead you to think deeply again of how this movie correlates to the real world. Sure, there are action scenes, but they are not the main attraction. Rather, it was how V interacts with the other characters, and how they life changes with the interaction.

V for Vendetta won't seem or feel or sound or play like the greatest movie ever but do any of the very best movies? No, they merge with you in timely harmony; seep in like wine over time into the walls of an oak barrel. Best movie in 25yrs, quietly, subtly, almost surprisingly...the way it should be. Were the fireworks over the top? Maybe, but it was so good overall (even the Chief Inspector, a role player in the truest sense, was incredible and believable). Just see it, and understand. Humanity is all we really have in this physical universe, and any movie that connects us and reaches through the screen to enter our soul deserves a place in the top 250 and plenty of other movies there have no business, we all know it.

","The Wachowskis have done it again with V for Vendetta! Brilliant...it's a movie with many layers. To the popcorn-munching-coke-drinking-pure-entertainment-seeking moviegoer it's a fast paced action flick. Look a little deeper and you see the intriguing plot, the evergreen idea of one man standing up to the system, LOVELY dialogues (Shakespeare is probably smiling from his grave!), great camera-work... But the true nature of this film lies one level deeper...it's more than a movie...it's a clarion call to all the peoples of the world: ""See what your future might look like if you allow fear to drive your thought!"" And there could not be a more relevant context for this message than today's strife-torn world. V represents the spirit of freedom that exists to varying extents within all of us. It is up to us to recognize the V in us. While he uses a mask to reveal his true nature, we use our own faces to hide ours! Our faces are but masks...about time we changed that! And Hugo Weaving's V really comes alive and stands larger than life! And to think Weaving accomplishes all that without ever using an actor's greatest tool, his face! Using only voice and dialogue delivery, he brings V to life. The texture he lends to his lines (all the quotes in particular) adds an operatic elegance to the film. Marvelous!"
"lloyd-42","Null","5","10","25 March 2006"," This movie is not about a terrorist.
","*** May contain Spoilers *** This movie was a pleasure in a great many ways. One of my indicators for the greatness of a movie is how it does when I think about it after the fact and my fondness for this one only grows with the passage of time.<br/><br/>There are many things worth saying about this movie, but much of it has been well said by others. I want to say something in response to those that seem to miss the mark when considering the underlying point to be gleaned from this.<br/><br/>First, this movie is not an attack on U.S. policy. To think that it is is to take a garment off the rack and claim that it was specifically cut to fit just one customer. This is about regular people living under an increasingly oppressive and tyrannical regime and one man being the catalyst to try to get them past their fears enough to stand up for what they believe is right.<br/><br/>Second, I do not see that this movie is about a terrorist. I see a terrorist as attacking the innocent along with those perceived as guilty. ""V"" did not do that. He attacked icons of the administration and those that were specifically known by him to be guilty of heinous crimes.<br/><br/>His efforts were to free people from their fears. This was done on a group level with the city as a whole, and an individual, ""Evey."" He also did not press his ideas on the unwilling. He left ideas to those who could respond to them. In all cases he wanted people to be freed from their fears and he had no desire to simply replace one set of fears for another. He wanted them to be free. Hence, he left them a choice, which is necessary for there to be freedom in the first place. Terrorists do not want to free you from slavery. They want you to change masters. Terrorists do not want you do be without fear. They want you to fear them. ""V"" made his building bombings a spectator sport. They were not done to cause fear in the people, just in the government.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful film and I think that some that have seen it should reconsider their idea on its point."

","I went to the theater expecting to either love this movie or hate it... such as it is with ""comic book"" movies. Having heard all the ""terrorist-as-a-hero"" arguments from both sides, and knowing going in that we would never see the protagonist of this film's face (but only the Guy Fawkes mask that he wears throughout), I was not convinced I would connect with the main characters sufficiently to recommend this movie to others.<br/><br/>I am convinced now.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is top-notch. Hugo Weaving, whose strident voice and incredible screen presence, which has been seen in such blockbusters as the ""Matrix"" trilogy as well as the ""LOTR"" trilogy, gives such a commanding performance that as V's emotions change, you can almost it registering on the blank facade of the mask he wears. Natalie Portman turns in another stellar performance as Evey, a vulnerable, terrified young woman who, with V's help, breaks through the shell of fear that the totalitarian government that England has become has created around her. The supporting cast is also outstanding: John Hurt as the vile, draconian Chancellor Sutler, Stephen Rea as the intuitive Inspector Finch, and Stephen Fry as Gordon, friend/father-figure to Evey and a local TV celebrity.<br/><br/>This movie is also well-plotted and moves along at a crisp pace. The action sequences are well-choreographed, the ""explosions"" are well-executed (and are more to lend an air of poignance to the mood of the film rather than to satisfy our need for such things), and the dialogue, while at times over the top, is well-scripted.<br/><br/>But the best moments in the film involve the interaction between V and Evey. The parental love that he feels for her is obvious, even though at one point he has to result to some rather cruel tactics in order to ensure her loyalty to him.<br/><br/>Does the movie end the way you think it's going to? Probably. Will that detract from your enjoyment of it? Not a whit. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone of teenage years and up (young children would probably find it too dark, and one fight scene is particularly gory).<br/><br/>MINI-SPOILER There is one uproariously laugh-out-loud moment, which anyone who was a fan of the old ""Benny Hill Show"" will recognize immediately.<br/><br/>My score 10/10."

In a shadow of what the former Soviet Union was, this is a harsh world, where fear rules the minds of the inhabitants of this once free country. Horrible atrocities are committed daily (just which ones, you'll need to see the movie for), and there is only one man who stands against it. An idea.<br/><br/>The trailers would lead you to believe the film is action-packed, with little story, when in fact, it's just the opposite. While there are action segments (and they are PHENOMANOL) there is more then enough story to make you genuinely care for the characters portrayed on-screen. There are moments of great sympathy for the oppressed people, and there are also moments that make you want to stand up and cheer, because Weaving's performance is incredibly portrayed.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a spectacular outing by the Wachowski Brothers, and more than worthy of the nine stars I have given it.

After a few minutes I found myself drawn into this changed world that the film represented and excited for what was to come of this already amazing movie. The movie tells the tale of futuristic London and the almost Nazi-like government that controls it and how one man, who calls himself ""V"", decides to overthrow this fascist organization. With the help of a young girl, he plots to destroy many buildings that have emotional,links and sentimental value to the fascist government to make a statement to the people that they can stand up for their freedom.<br/><br/>You find yourself tied into the back-story of the ""V"" character and his reasons for his activism.

"UnlovedSeason","9","5","10","20 March 2006"," Visionary
","Some of us read the book by Alan Moore many years ago. Some of us regard it as at least as good as his oft-lauded opus, Watchmen. Some of us were very wary indeed when we heard there was to be a film version... and even more so when it transpired that Moore himself had refused to have anything to do with it... to be credited, even.<br/><br/>Some of us went to see it anyway and are so very glad we did. What an amazing film. In an unusual climate of heavy political movie-making comes this: a fantasy thriller with all the adventure, action and, well, silliness you could want, but nevertheless a political message you cannot ignore to boot. If anything, Moore's strident left-wing opinions are given even more weight than his own original work carries  now that the reader must find them a quarter of a century out of date. Surely, he must be proud of this film and the ingenious way it has updated his ideas to reflect the current political situation?<br/><br/>You can pick holes, of course. I got used to Portman's imperfect accent a lot more quickly than I did the Wachowski brothers' occasionally overcooked outsider's take on scripting English characters, though. And V's introduction  all 'v'-word alliteration  is badly misconceived and had me worrying for a minute or two. But things soon settle down and though it's been a few years, I can say that almost all the major examples of Moore's brilliance that I could recall and was hoping would have been translated from the page are here on screen - meaning moments of considerable shock and horror, beauty, emotion and profundity. The double-barred-cross softening of the fascist-church imagery is a tiny niggle in the face of scenes such as: the padeophile Bishop; Evey facing her fear; the whole Valerie / The Salt Flats story; the bedside chat - victim and villain reversed; and the daring (in light of all-too-recent horrendous real-world events) inclusion of the London tube bomb, exactly as in the original.<br/><br/>Better still, the additional/extrapolated material  lots of stuff about the Koran and Muslims being persecuted, the 'formerly United States', bird flu etc.  and the whole subplot involving Stephen Fry's character (ultimately harrowing in the extreme) are actually improvements on Moore's anti- Thatcher polemic. This story could scarcely be more relevant in the now. Sue Perkins, reviewing the film on ITV, was annoyed that the future fascist British government is depicted as having come out of the Conservative Party - fearing the film- makers had missed a trick, but in fact, herself, completely missing the subtler point that our current Labour administration (which she is not alone in deploring certain actions of), in moving the 'centre' further to the right, is indeed undermining the left-wing alternative for our democracy and making it more likely that a far-right movement such as is depicted in the film could feasibly emerge (the gods forbid). Where else would it come out of? The distopia shown in the film is precisely what the worst subset of Tory supporters  specifically Daily Mail readers  want for our country!<br/><br/>Another critic who got it wrong was Jonathan Ross (on the BBC's Film programme). He absolutely hated V for Vendetta and urged his viewers to give it a miss. Thank goodness I didn't listen  fortunately, he'd mentioned that he found Moore's comic 'overrated', so I was able to add another 'wary' to my expectations  but on the other side of the balance. That balance is now tipping  the film magazines are awarding 3 and 4 stars out of 5, and the mixed audience I sat with on a Sunday afternoon were certainly gripped from start to finish. Don't miss it!"

File this one under Films That Matter.<br/><br/>After a brief introduction to Guy Fawkes' foiled attempt to destroy Parliament 400 years ago, the film, set in London in the near future, opens as Eve-y (Natalie Portman) is stopped by police for being on the streets after curfew. The film's masked antihero, V, saves her from being raped. After she later saves him from being killed by police, he protects her by hiding her. In so doing, he brings her into his world of revenge and revolution.<br/><br/>The film is as stylish as anything in the Wachowski Brothers' Matrix Trilogy, but with much stronger characters. Portman once again proves how phenomenal an actor she is. V for Vendetta is as much about her journey as it is V's revenge.<br/><br/>Whether it comes in the guise of shadowy manipulators, smirking simians, or charming rogues doesn't really matter. The power of the State is always arrayed against the liberty of the people. The last scene is hopeful, recalling as it does the fall of the Berlin Wall, where an impotent government finally crumbled before the will of a determined people. The people are powerful, and the most powerful thing they can do is to refuse to go along with the program."

What have the masses learned from V but to behave just as the oppressors have. They do ""overcome their fear"" (which is an important message) but just as Evey had through her own ""rendition"" - you have to ask yourself 'at what price?' The last scene, in this sense, does not equate to a peaceful overtaking of the government - the masses simply show their support for another flavor of terrorist and enjoy the power vacuum his assassinations (although arguably justifiable) have created. V does realize that he is a ""monster"", but such a revelation coming from an individual, who has calmly declared his willingness to kill earlier, simply comes across as less of a realization and more of a simple letting go of that monster because the deed was done.<br/><br/>The politics of this film are for this reason ineffective. We should feel empowered that we can overcome tyranny, yes, but not by becoming terrorists ourselves. It's a dangerous message. I fear not every movie fan out there realizes the hypocrisy of the characters V and Evey and that this is the really interesting part of the story. Peaceful revolutionaries are the ones who embody pure ""ideas"" - not like V who realizes his ideas and aspirations through hate (what was the lesson Skywalker had to learn?). The same justification Jason Bourne or Rambo has to wreak havoc on government employees obviously flies here as well - if the ""man"" is the one who created you, you've got a right to break him down, like he broke you down.<br/><br/>Apart from the politics, the plot really put a strain on my suspension of disbelief. Albeit a film based on a graphic novel, it was hard to understand how some rouge could afford to finance the costumes and such he sent to (random?) inhabitants of London. I could have been content with disfigurement and even super-strength as a result of the experiments, but somehow too many questions were left at the end of the film. Maybe he had a blog (a vlog?) and a mailing list, who knows.<br/><br/>As for character development, Natalie Portman really is the saving grace of this film. It is easy to get attached to the likable portrayal of a working girl caught up in social injustice. As for Weaving, there's an obvious hurdle to overcome in that he has become this jaded gentleman - some kind of philosophical street preaching version of Jason Bourne meets Bruce Wayne. It's hard to relate to that. Some kind of Bravehart-style development would have given us something more to hold onto than the enigma that is V. Even Rambo was at some point just John Rambo - if even for a short time. We never saw who he was before, just kind of how this monster was ""manufactured"".<br/><br/>The accent problems by Portman mentioned by some didn't really bother me that much in light of my other difficulties swallowing this thing whole.<br/><br/>I thought that for such a dark film, the color pallet (so to say) was all in all a bit too cheery. A better choice would have been, say more like the first Batman film. Here we saw an intellectual ""millionare socialite"" (even less likable by the masses) who has it all, but the darker tones of Bruce Wanye's manor / layer make him nonetheless intriguing. This darker side of Wayne is really nearly totally accomplished by great art-direction and photography work. V is like diet-coke Brue Wayne without cool wheels.<br/><br/>The attempt to show V as an intellectual in his underground layer, and as a softy for old movies, kind of threw me off a bit. The sword fighting with the suit of armor reminded me of that fat light-saber kid on youtube.<br/><br/>All in all, it kept my attention and Weaving really delivered at times complex lines without batting an eye. It just could have been a bit more potent in all respects. It's not bad for a rental, but for the price of a theater ticket, not up to snuff."

","There is almost nothing good about this movie. The dialogue is cheesy and ridiculous, the acting is mostly bad (which is odd, because the cast was generally pretty good) and the script appears to have been written by someone who only skimmed the Wikipedia page of the original comic. I bet even the catering sucked. The movie decides to change the title character, ""V"" into a liberally biased hero. This seems fine, until you remember that he is a psychotic anarchic, terrorist. In fact his political beliefs seem to be the only thing in keeping him in the right, since he probably kills even more people than in the comic, due to the film's complete lack of subtlety, which it also demonstrates by hitting you over the head with the Anti-Bush themes (how exactly does Iraq end in a nuclear war again?)that they had to completely change the setting and premise to squeeze in. This movie is so full of explosions, it might as well be from Michael Bay. In fact, he'd probably do a better job. Most of the other characters are different too; the 16 year old prostitute is now just some random lady who works in the TV studio, her love interest is now gay, so they can shove in a creepy and unnecessary romantic subplot between her and V, the radio announcer is now a British caricature of Glenn Beck, and the dictator goes from being one of the most interesting characters to a cartoon super villain. The worst part is the addition of a virus subplot, meaning the entire population is actually hateful of the government and sympathetic towards V. This is all build-up to the retarded finale which makes no sense at all, and happens to be exactly the opposite of how the comic ends. I would tell you what happens, but it's so thoroughly ridiculous, you have to see it for yourself. Or better yet, don't, because no matter what the rating says, this movie is bad."

Even when they do finally cut to flashbacks/forwards, they are slowed down by the voice over. The very first scene should be an indicator that the movie is going to move too slowly, filled with long alliterated dialogue, which is supposed to be comical but just ends up being annoying. The entire movie tries to pound it's message into people's minds, ""People shouldn't fear their governments; governments should fear their people,"" but the message is overdone. It feels force-fed and doesn't have any subtlety to it. In the movie they talk about how writers use lies to tell the truth. Writers also use fiction to bring about philosophy, hiding it like candy coating. This movie was all sophism, one big rant without enough story wrapping it up into a swallowable package. Don't get me wrong, the message is a good one, and I really wish the movie could have delivered it in a blockbuster fashion, but they didn't.

"arussell23","10","3","5","25 June 2015"," 'V for Vendetta' is an excellent action thriller with surprising amounts of heart
","In the late 1980s, Alan Moore and David Lloyd teamed up to create a graphic novel entitled V for Vendetta, and in the mid-2000s, the novel was made into a film of the same name and released. The strange thing about the film was that it truly did spark the Anonymous movement, with people in the organization wearing Guy Fawkes masks to protect their identities. I became interested in the film because of this, and decided to check it out. What did I think of it? Let's find out.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta follows a anarchist freedom fighter who identifies as V who attempts to stop the United Kingdom's totalitarian regime. A working-class girl named Evie gets involved in V's plans, and soon the two pair up as a detective and the High Chancellor himself give chase to stop their plans to blow up Parliament on the 5th of November.<br/><br/>This film is actually a really good one, which is kind of surprising since I went in with not that high expectations. The acting is fantastic. Hugo Weaving manages to do a stellar job as V, despite we never see his face and the most we see of him is his burned up hands. Natalie Portman does a pretty good job as Evie, managing to portray the character stereotype of the person caught up in something they don't want to do, but it still manages to work out well. Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves both do a great job as the detectives who are trying to find V and Evie.<br/><br/>John Hurt is a fantastic person to watch as the High Chancellor, and manages to portray such an evil role that I was surprised. In most movies that I've seen him in, he's the good guy. But whatever. And of course, Stephen Fry does a fantastically humorous job as Gordon Deitrich, and really brings a level of jokes and humor to part of the film, that I think it really needed. The screenplay written by the Wachowski brothers (or is it siblings now? I don't know), was a great one and especially fit the tone of the film I think everyone involved was going for. The speeches that V gave were very well written and got me really pumped for what the rest of the film was going to bring.to the table.<br/><br/>The cinematography in the film was just amazing and it looked really kind-of post-apocalyptic, even if the world on the outside still looked somewhat normal. The set pieces with the film looked pretty good as well, even though some of them were probably just regular homes in London. The editing was really great as well, especially in scenes like the finale and scenes between V and people trying to attack him.<br/><br/>This ties into the special effects that look great and work very well, much better than I expected them to for a 2006 movie. It's no Bullet Time from The Matrix, but it looks great. The music by composer Dario Marianelli was really great for the times it was used. I say this because most of the movie had other music other than Marianelli's score, but the times when his score was used, it still worked very well.<br/><br/>Overall, V for Vendetta is a fantastic film. The acting, screenplay, cinematography, set design, editing and special effects all look and sound really fantastic. If you haven't seen the film, I definitely recommend it. It's a fun film and a surprisingly heartfelt one, especially towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>10/10 | Grade: A"

","V for Vendetta is the movie that I thought was a great comic book because at first, a lot of people attended this film to be the biggest joke ever released in theaters, but after the film was released, I saw the film for the first time on DVD and then I watched a few times of FX and they still show it on TV today.<br/><br/>The film follows an anarchist freedom fighter named V, who attempts to ignite a revolution against the brutal fascist regime that has subjgated the dystopian United Kingdom and exterminated it's opponents in concentration camps.<br/><br/>A girl named Evey, a working class girl caught in V's mission and the detective Finch leads a desperate quest to stop V.<br/><br/>The film has been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government; libertarians and anarchists have used it to promote their beliefs. The film was originally scheduled for release by Warner Bros. Pictures on Friday November 4, 2005 (which was a day before the 400th Guy Fawkes Night), but it was delayed and was released on Marrch 17, 2006 to positive critical reception and box office success.<br/><br/>I liked the story and screenplay by The Wachowski Brothers, who directed and wrote The Matrix Trilogy, Speed Racer, Jupiter Ascending and Cloud Atlas and the dialogue is just wonderful on screen.<br/><br/>The cinematography is good and I have to give credit to the late Adrian Biddle for doing such a fantastic great job. The music by Dario Marianelli is just spectacular and amazing. The action sequences are just spectacular and my favorite scene at the end and it was amazing.<br/><br/>The acting is amazing. Hugo Weaving plays V and he does good and I liked him in the Matrix films as Agent Smith and he is good as the vigilante and he is spectacular with Natalie Portman in his scenes. Natalie Portman plays Evey and she is good as she was as Padme in the STAR WARS prequel trilogy and her performance along with Weaving is really amazing.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Stephen Rea as Finch and he is amazing, Rupert Graves as Dominic Stone and John Hurt as High Chancellor Adam Sutler and they all done a good job in their roles that they are in.<br/><br/>Overall, while I was scared that V FOR VENDETTA would be stupid as hell, it turned out to be one of the best comic book films ever made.<br/><br/>8/10"

"h-stratev","10","3","5","1 February 2015"," V for Vendetta Analysis
","V for Vendetta tells the story of a girl, rescued from rape by a masked man calling himself ""V"". Set against the totalitarianism in Britain, V ignites a revolution when detonates a memorial building in London. Skilled in deception and martial arts, he urges the citizens of Britain to rise up against the tyranny of the parliament.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is not just a regular Hollywood thriller movie. According to James Barardinelli(2005) this film is full of ideas, giving the viewers things to think about. The ideological context of the movie is how a society, a whole country can be enslaved by the political system. How without a war you can possess people's minds and you can make them slaves of the totalitarian regime. MaryAnn Johanson (2005) says that: ""The movie asks questions about the price we are willing to pay by giving up freedom to feel safe. The source of people's obedience is the fear. Fear of what will happen if they rise against the regime and lose. This is the time when the country meets ""V"". He is reflection of both the society and the parliament. Person who is strong, mysterious and with clear idea, his only purpose is to remove the totalitarianism and free the people. V's mask is a caricature of Fawkes's face who attempted to blow the British parliament in November 5 1605, but fail. Not by a coincidence V's plan is the same. MaryAnn Johanson (2005) says that : ""He is Batman and the Joker all at once"". It is like that because he appears like a saviour for a young girl, and at the next moment committing a crime on his own. The movie reflects a socio-political condition. According to Peter Travers (2005) The film is inspired by ideas which are not ""computer generated"". This means that the ideas are real and can be helpful in some way in our life. There are events that had happened years before in almost all European countries. The movie reminds me a lot of the Stalinism and Stalin's way of controlling the country. There are 2 particular scenes in the movie which I would like to discuss in connection with the reflection of the socio-political conditions. The first scene is the one, when V shows his face for first time on the television. He is called a terrorist by the government and chase by the police, militaries and everything that serve the parliament. The question is why? Is it because he blew up an old building? No, it is because he has an idea, idea that can change not only the people but the whole world. According to Claudia Puig (2005) ""This multi- layered movie should be appreciated by it's deeper message about personal responsibility, political oppression and revolutionary change. In his first appearance on the TV, nobody believes in ""V"" , deep inside this is the structure of the totalitarianism. You don't believe in anyone who is not part of the parliament, and everyone who has other views is being chased down and in most cases killed. That is why the government is frightened of his appearance. Other fact which is actually a part of our life even now is the covering of cases. In the movie very obviously is shown one of them. As soon as the authorities saw the ideas of ""V"" and his targets, they announced through the media, that he is killed, so that the risk of rebellion will be reduced. Unfortunately in reality during the totalitarianism the media was the strongest manipulator of the society, and this is another example that the movie gives, compared to our real life. Talking about the media, let's move on with the second scene which I would like to discuss, and it is the moment when the government desperately is trying to hold the population on their side, again through the usage of television as a medium.It is shown on the TV how the police is taking some ""good"" actions. Through a manipulated videos the government is trying to affect the people and make them believe that, without this political power they are nothing. But what happens when everyone of the ordinary people have his own idea ? When the people realize that they are not puppets and they can have their own point of view? The critical moment comes when the society stop to believe in the media, and in the authorities. This is what the director shows in this particular scene. If the media fails, the trust of the nation is lost. In this moment start the chaos, the anarchy and as it is said in the film "" People should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people"". It is not only because people vote and choose who to rule them, but because the society is the biggest power in the country. One of the ideas shown in the movie is that in order to change, people need hope, hope for something better. The movie has an influence of the society even in our days. The group of hackers called "" The Anonymous"" have a logo which is the same like the mask of the character in the movie ""V"". Is it a coincidence? Like it is said in the movie"" There is no such thing like coincidence"" and everything is with purpose. Influenced by the movie, they wear the logo of the mask because like ""V"" they are also fighters for a change. Change that the governments do not understand, and like the main character in the movie they are prosecuted.<br/><br/>The movie, challenge in full force the ideological system of the dictatorship. It shows us that if we want a change we have to fight for it. Full of ideas and very deep meaning the movie show us a different point of view over the situation during the totalitarianism."

Fourth reaction: This will unquestionably head to my all- time favorite movies list.<br/><br/>It has been a really long time since I gave a movie the ten stars without second thoughts. And with all those crappy and disappointing movies around, I thought I'd never do it again. Rare are those movies that leave such an impression on me and result in this lingering feeling of enthusiasm. I know, to some people, I might be overrating, but this is exactly my idea of how a perfect movie should be.<br/><br/>I have to admit I was let down knowing that the Wachowskis are the moving force behind this project (I've never been a fan of The Matrix and never will be!) but hell with my prejudices! They have succeeded in turning V from just an impressive comic character to an international, timeless symbol of revolution. The setting of the movie is a futuristic Britain, but the practices of the oppressive government (that strongly reminds me of Orwell's Big Brother) pretty much resembles the practices of all oppressive governments in history. This leaves you wondering: Are the people in power really that stupid? When will they ever learn that peoples cannot be controlled?<br/><br/>James McTeigue did a great job in keeping the movie as symbolic as possible to universalize the experience. The film is not engaged in details; the focus is always on the consequences of the events, not the events themselves. That is why scenes related to the past are repeatedly juxtaposed with scenes from the present so that they would acquire new meanings every time they are shown on the screen (an example is V coming out from the fire in Larkhill). The editing relies heavily on juxtaposition also to stress the unmistakable tone of duality in the movie; fear is juxtaposed with belief, past with present, fire with water, oppression with freedom... etc, there are certainly no gray areas. In addition, the cinematography retains this 'unreal' symbolic effect by using colors that leaves the impression of watching an animated comic book. McTeigue's shots and camera movements are definitely breathtaking - the guy knows what he is doing, without doubt! I also like the fact that the Wachowskis and McTeigue insisted on the anonymity of V, despite the Hollywoodian nagging urge for final revelation.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving.. Hugo Weaving! How can I possibly love him more?! In V for Vendetta, he has proved that a good actor does not even need a face to perform a role. How did he make me 'see' every facial expression and read his eyes from behind the mask?! I have no idea! It is not just his expressive body language I'm talking about, there was more to it; he character of V radiated a certain aura of grandeur mixed with rebellion and playfulness you can never miss. Hugo Weaving... RESPECT. As for Natalie Portman, she was as great as always, no question about it.<br/><br/>Movies like this one adds up to your life experience, even if you are not appreciative of cinema as art.

"robert-259-28954","9","3","5","23 November 2012"," I enjoyed this film very much.
","In fact, I'll make a prediction: THIS FILM WILL BECOME A CULT CLASSIC. Of this I have no doubt. After several viewings for friends, my most recent one on Thanksgiving day with an English friend, revealed many fascinating things about the movie that I had no prior knowledge of that I'd care to share. For example, the protagonist, Guy Fawkes, was an actual person, a revolutionary who attempted to blow up Parliament when he believed the government had become too corrupt, in the 1600's. In fact, the Brits still celebrate the occasion on November the fifth, the same date in the film, and apparently, their own fourth of July. Most of the great character actors in the piece were top British actors as well, including a brief but superbly nuanced role of the female doctor, portrayed by Sinead Cusack, who is actually Jeremy Irons' wife, another interesting point of interest. I enjoyed the diminutive, waifish, Natalie Portman in the main role, her English accent learned in just two weeks, and ""one of the best"" in my English guest's opinion, adding another interesting note. But far and away, in my opinion this film belonged to the wonderful Hugo Weaving, who actually replaced the original star, who while into the sixth week of shooting, had to quit the picture due his growing claustrophobia in wearing the iconic mask in each and every scene. Hugo, who had to originally turn down the plum role because of previous commitments, then had the auspicious good luck of stepping into the role after that. Stephen Rea turns in another terrific and understated performance as the long suffering head investigator. And did I mention the WONDERFUL, EXQUISITE AND SPECTACULAR acting turn provided by Stephen Fry?? Being a gay AND an atheist, he brings so much of his real life history into the role that the performance never fails to move me. This man is a deep soul, and his intelligence and sensitive portrayals illuminate each and every role he's involved in. Casting him for this part was a decision of pure genius. My only nitpick of the entire film was it's length, which I felt was a little excessive. But a fine movie nonetheless, with kudos to James McTeigue."

But the nation receives a wake-up call when mysterious masked terrorist ""V"" (Weaving) blows up the Old Bailey and calls for the citizens to rise up against their oppressors.<br/><br/>The most likely aspect of the film is ""V"", a character hellbent on bringing Britain to it's knee's and then to create a new peace that hadn't been seen since Britain has currently become a totalitarian state.<br/><br/>Weaving brings leaps and bounds of life to the lead character, who in awe is the show stealer of the film.<br/><br/>Despite the characterisation of ""V"", the rest is clearly average. The main hold-back is the pace of the momentum that the film considerably lacks in. The first half an hour starts out as a 5 star action thriller but slowly degrades into a murky mess of keeping what we saw in the first half an hour down to an average three star action thriller.<br/><br/>Verdict: For what was a 5 star classic in the first thirty minutes soon rapidly switches to a three star action thriller due to keeping the pacing and momentum up."

Hollywood must be getting lazy to not offer something to compete with this. in my area most of the stinker movies don't even make it to the theatres, i can't understand what happened with this one. who let it past the screeners and allowed it to be played at my theater. i feel robbed for the price of the movie ticket and drink. my time would have been better spent cleaning my basement or reading the bible."
"jcrowd13","1","13","36","27 March 2006"," Vendetta, Another Hollywood Hissy Fit
","I did not know much about ""V for Vendetta"" until I saw it. I had seen the trailer once before and had completely forgotten about it. When looking at the South By Southwest Film Festival Schedule, I saw it as the main premiere for the night. I figured I'd check it out, after all even if the film is bad, at least you get to look at Nathalie Portman for 2 hours.<br/><br/>As the film began, it was plain to see that it had an agenda. One not so surprising from the west coast. I had been raped by Hollywood once again. The film's whole ""vendetta"" was a direct attack on Americans and conservatives. Another hissy fit from the Hollywood elite. The film likens our current government to the fascist totalitarianism of Hitler and other dictators. The film is set out to make Americans look stupid, and acts on the presumptions that the entire public agrees with these views. ""Vendetta"" tries to justify terrorism, and ridiculously attempts to demonize those who don't tolerate homosexuality and the hateful writings that make up the Koran. One scene specifically comes to mind when a lesbian daughter is confronting her parents about her lifestyle choice. The parents yell and cry, and as the daughter leaves the father throws her baby picture in the garbage. The attacks are painfully obvious, and as one of the 50 million+ Americans who elected our president, I cannot see how this film is supposed to be representative of the public's sentiments. The film makes it seem as if all citizens think their rights and freedoms are being violated, yet the majority doesn't. The filmmakers really think they are taking on a noble cause and speaking for the people. Yet they have failed to connect with their audience once again. The film's supporters will only be those that were in their camp to begin with.<br/><br/>One fun thing about screening this film at a film festival in Austin was to be able to play with the crowd, the so called ""individualists"". There were about 1500 clones in the audience at The Paramount for the film's debut, and all of them were followers. There is a famous line in the film by the terrorist V where he says ""People should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people..."" a statement any patriotic, freedom-loving American wholeheartedly agrees with, an ironically liberals want more government. The funny thing is how all the Austinites clapped in unison, but yet again for the losing side, as though this were some kind of new revolutionary statement. As the claps died out I cried out ""but I'm not afraid of my government!"" And continued to be the dissenting heckler until the end.<br/><br/>As I walked out I made it very clear that there was at least one person in Austin that did not blindly accept the messages put out by this film. From a film and story stand point the film is so painfully predictable and preachy. The funniest thing is that so many people are taking this film seriously when it is an adaptation of a comic book... from the matrix guys! ""V for Vendetta"" is just another example of how out of touch Hollywood is with their audience."

So the second half of the movie I was just waiting for it to end. Really awful movie. Cheap and stupid! Can't understand it that somebody liked it. The whole story is really very bad.

This film attempts to be a dramatic, psychological and philosophical film but ends up a cheesy romance with awkward dialogue that attempts to explain some of the ideas behind the film.

"annbeatty","1","8","20","23 March 2006"," I'm an anarchist and I still hate this movie
","From someone who read the graphic novel before I knew the movie was coming out, the movie was incredibly disappointing. The style was so wrong. Way too flashy, not gritty or dark enough. All the human elements of the comic were totally lost. The relationships between the politicians and their wives, which gave some depth to the characters, were completely taken out. The politician characters were just robots, as was V. They made him like a PG superhero - no style, no substance. The whole thing was incredibly fake. I could have accepted the lack of depth if they'd made it really, really cool. But it was just cheesy.<br/><br/>A lot of the darker, more subversive elements were taken out. For example, when the detective visits Larkhill in the book, he goes on acid. That could have been done really cool in the movie. But it was left out. Also, Evey is supposed to be poor, and the society is supposed to be a lot more repressed. In the book, V finds her working as a prostitute. I think they decided to make her, and the rest of the country, more middle class to prove some sort of point about material wealth making people apathetic.<br/><br/>Which is the real problem with the movie. They took a totally cool book (written in the 80s, I think), and added a whole bunch of unnecessary modern political context. All the overt references to terrorism, U.S. wars, avian flu, biological warfare, media control, plus the overdone Nazi imagery. Just ridiculous. They could have made it much, much more subtle and (I hope) people still would have understood what it was getting at. If they were trying to make something politically persuasive, they totally failed. It'll just offend Conservative-minded people, and it's too stupid to have any real value. The only people I can imagine liking this are really dumb liberals. Plus, it's just not cool at all."

There are also several other annoying problems with this film: First, it invokes the example of Guy Fawkes from history as a basis for its agenda, but seems completely ignorant about who Fawkes was or why he did what he did. Fawkes was not an anarchist. He was a frustrated Roman Catholic who was attempting to disrupt the protestant regime of the Stuarts and reinstate Catholicism in 17th century England. He believed that Catholics were being persecuted under the protestants, but in actuality religious persecution had been greatly reduced from the terrors wrought by Mary Tudor (Bloody Mary) upon protestants. In any case, Fawkes attempt was a dismal failure, and the Stuarts and Parliament continued to rule. Eventually it was the protestant movement that elevated the democratic power of parliament over the Crown and instated the constitutional monarchy. The original poem ""Remember"" referred to in the film is actually a warning against Fawkes and his ilk, and a prayer of thanks for his failure and the continued peace of the nation and its king.

The comics is an entertaining essay; in great part it's about anarchy opposing fascism. The movie is propaganda about today's watered ideas of democracy, opposing concentrated power. Which is lame.<br/><br/>A strong example is about who and what an anarchist is. Without spoiling, V himself is one type, and the girl represents a very different type. The future of V is carefully crafted in the book and is utterly meaningful to the tale; to his movie's counterpart, things just happen; blandly.<br/><br/>OK, let's just say that you don't care about the book.

"nEoFILM","5","4","8","14 March 2011"," Missed the point... Ponderously
","""BOLLOCKS!"" This is the standard British insult which is banded about by the stereotypical characters as perceived by our American cousins. Or is this a succinct review of the film? Alan Moore, more famously known for Watchmen, was the original author of the graphic novel of the same name, which was published between 1982 and '85 and then later reprinted in full by DC comics, had his name removed during production. The Brothers Wachowski, of The Matrix fame, a seminal film, penned the adaptation and did so without truly understanding the source.<br/><br/>We ended up with a dull, overly bombastic and ponderous take on a much more subversive novel, with stereotypical fascist villains, shown to have taken power by releasing a virus upon the country's population, rather than the comic's thesis on the apathetic voters, legitimately electing them.<br/><br/>This is Hollywood does Britain, and as usual, they got it wrong. This is a sci-fi fantasy, where the hero/terrorist dons a Guy Fawkes mask and romantically spreads revolution across the country. But Hugo Weaving's ranting, good though he always is, is just boring and overblown. He is a Nutter and not in the good sense. I don't understand what gives him the right to blow up Parliament for us? I think that he's the other side of the same coin; a dictator in his own right. Is this the point? Maybe, but that point is lost when the film is trying to walk the fine line between epic political film-making with an edge, and a major comic book adaptation by the creators of the revolutionary Matrix. Though, the ill-conceived sequels should have served as a warning to us all as to what to expect from this project.<br/><br/>When I first watched this, I thought it was okay, but on repeat viewings it just continues to fall further and further down in my estimation. Boring, contrived, and misconceived. The Brothers Grimm Wachowski need to rethink their strategy and their role in the business and they are in no way, shape or form serious filmmakers. They have a fantastic and they did have a revolutionary view of cinematography, but as for being deep and meaningful writers... more ponderous and self absorbed than anything else."

","From memory when this movie came out most reviewers gave it 6-7 out of 10. This is a more accurate reflection of the film's merit than what the average IMDb user has given it. I would put this down to a proportion of users having not seen enough 'good' movies in their time. For those who have seen enough of these movies they would know that nearly everything in this film has already been done many times before. Honestly, how many times is the 1984/big brother theme going to be rehashed? It is a great book and all but someone needs to think of a new dystopian premise. The other one that has been done to death is the plague that either kills people or turns them into monsters. The only variation of this film is that it combines the latter two premises, but really, that is just a testament to the fact that it is a 'dystopia by numbers' film. I guess it's just a trend - a money making operation.<br/><br/>To be fair, had I seen this when I was 12 I probably would have thought it was pretty good, but looking at it objectively there are definitely better equivalent films.

","Based on the 1980s graphic novel by Alan Moore, ""V for Vendetta"" had tremendous potential: A fabulous source book, top-notch actors, and brilliant directors. And then they blew it. The graphic novel, which was more libertarian than liberal, was very even minded, not truly siding with either point of view. It contrasted two extremes: anarchism and fascism, and let the reader decide which was preferable. Most importantly, it was most definitely about England, not America. This was their first mistake. They changed the plot to appeal to modern audience, but what they ended up doing was injecting US politics into a British story. Not nearly as even minded either, the film completely sides with the title character, who has gone from a libertarian anarchist to a liberal revolutionary. Worse still the plot line's back story is now a thinly veiled analogy of the 9/11 attacks though the eyes of conspiracy theorists. A tragic waste, considering the film's good points. The acting was phenomenal, especially Hugo Weavings, had to do the entire film masked, depriving him of the benefit of facial expression. The special effects were impressive too, reminiscent of the Wachowski Brothers work in ""The Matrix"". Unfortunately all this is lost in the poor storyline, which reduces this potentially operatic masterpiece to a sloppy political satire."

There is more diversity of English language accents within the UK than outside. For example the difference between a Scottish accent, a Liverpool accent and a Cornish accent is greater than the difference between a Californian, a New Zealander and a Londoner.<br/><br/>However in all my travels (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, USA, UK) I have never heard anyone sound at all like Natalie Portman's character Evey. She appears to be using a similar accent to the one she used for Padmé in Star Wars.<br/><br/>It is not a matter of ""correct pronunciation"".

"webviking6","2","4","8","27 January 2007"," Stylish, but seriously flawed...,
","V for Vendetta is a silly story about a victim of medical experimentation taking on the role of Guy Fawkes to lead society to revolution against the fascist oppressors and, oh, by the way, exact personal revenge on his tormentors in the government. In order to enjoy the movie, the level of deliberate suspension of belief you must maintain is extraordinarily high.<br/><br/>V (named because he was in cell labeled with a Roman numeral V) is rounded up by a fascist UK government with a group of 48 others and subjected to medical experiments, which kill almost everyone except V. Somehow (never explained) there is fire and explosions that result in massive damage to the medical facility and V escapes. Ten years later, V who can only exist behind a mask because he is so violently disfigured to be almost unrecognizable as a human, has ensconced himself in a formidable fortress built out of the closed London Underground. He has also managed to fill it with priceless works of art while digging out and laying track beneath the English Parliament building.<br/><br/>He then decides to go on the attack, and using a variety of terrorist tactics, blows up the Old Bailey, takes over the government controlled network and makes a personal broadcast to the nation, and goes on an assassination spree. Somehow Natalie Portman as Evey Hammond gets sucked up in V's path and is spirited back to his redoubt where they have deep conversations over fried eggs in toast, archaic jukebox music and the movie The Count of Monte Cristo.<br/><br/>Evey gets talked into helping V kill one of his victims, but only goes along with it to try to warn the victim (a high ranking bishop of the Church of England who likes his girls young). When V makes his appearance and kills the bishop, Evey escapes and makes her way to her boss's flat. Her boss is a popular variety show host on TV and just happens to also harbor revolutionary sentiment, although he does not express it as strongly as V. However, he does tear up a government approved script on his TV show and replace it with one that makes fun of the government's attempt to find V. He discovers that he misjudged the government's reaction to his show when jack-booted thugs appear at his flat in the middle of the night, beat him up and haul him off. He later gets executed because the government found a copy of the Koran in his flat. He wasn't Muslim, he ""just enjoyed the poetry."" Evey gets caught in this fracas and wakes up in a prison cell, where she is tortured for information about V. When she is threatened with immediate execution and still does not give up any information about V, she is told she is finally free. She walks out of her cell past the fake guards and discovers that she has been held by V all along, oh my! But V let her live and lets her go after extracting a promise to see her before November 5th, which is when V plans to blow up Parliament. Oh, and as near as I can tell the only reason V took on the Guy Fawkes persona was that Fawkes originally planned to blow up the English Parliament several hundred years ago. That and maybe V's penchant for swords and explosives as weapons of choice over guns. But really, it's probably because a wooden Guy Fawkes mask looks ""cool"" on someone dressed all in black.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the police discover that the Conservative Party used the fear that America's War on Terror generated to take control. They then purposely staged three biological attacks around the UK that killed over 100,000 people to cement their power. Then they rounded up all the writers and artists and killed them. Oh yeah, since Conservatives just absolutely hate homosexuals, they rounded all of them up and killed them too. They also conducted medical experiments on some of the gay people they rounded up. No word on whether V is gay, Evey tried to kiss him, but how much can you get through to someone by kissing his wooden mask. Now for some reason the government hates America. This all just goes to show how evil the fascist government is and how much V's revolution needs to succeed.<br/><br/>I won't bore you with the ending, it's pretty obvious what it would be anyway. The movie is basically a prettily filmed load of tripe. Even the fighting sequences aren't what I would expect from the Wachowski's except the one at the end, which is admittedly pretty cool. Some of the settings are effective, and the visual impact of the film is impressive. But you just can't get past the fact that the plot just stinks."

","I saw V is for Vendetta with a group of eight. We are the type who likes action and sophisticated films. This film did not make the cut; we came out laughing wondering what a waste of time. Overall, I think we thought it was a 4 of 10. I give it lower since it is a waste of Natalie Portman, John Hurt, and Stephen Rhea and lots of money. What makes it silly is that it takes a neo-Nazi totalitarian regime and gives it credibility in a future-England-like society. I can't see that happening. John Hurt was easy to see through as an evil prime minister. But can millions of people be that naive? Perhaps in a less sophisticated or educated society or a third world culture. But almost definitely not a modern western society. Terrorism conducted by V in his mask becomes justified to combat Nazi-like totalitarianism. OK, but conducted by a man who wears a silly mask? Is that truly credible? Brazil and 1984 (also with John Hurt) are far better films (and still not great films). Furthermore, the political monologues by V were not inspiring. It was like watching a clown trying to recite a serious Hamlet monologue. Hard to take serious. Even the cinematography is not particularly great but at least a bit atmospheric. The ending was downright silly as the climax builds up to a date to remember so the movie claims...but perhaps a date to forget if you watch the end...plain dumb. At least give the audience more credit for a believable movie."

","the only reason i rented this was cuz my wife expressed interest in seeing it, i really had no desire, but i watched it anyway, what a waste of 2 hours plus. i usually don't comment on movies here but this was without a doubt the worst movie I've seen all year, and i watched several Bruce Campbell films. the acting was horrible and the story was just stupid, there are far too many problems to addressed all of them, the ending was totally cheesy, wow, a whole nation is gonna put on masks and stand against the evil empire, corny and cheesy, even the action wasn't that great, saw it the first time the W brothers did it in the Matrix movies. please tell em there wont be a sequel, ugh just awful, and a 8.3 average?!!!! so long as it has a big explosion at the end that warrants a high rating? i guess so. the movie viewing public is obviously devoid of any ability to adequately criticize a movie."

","This is based on a comic book and such movies tend to be stupid. Still, I thought that the plot seemed interesting to a point.<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean this film is good. The whole thing looks a bit cheap and it was a surprise for me finding out that it went to theatres in 2006. It really looks a bit low-budget, that's for sure. When a helicopter crashes, for example, you only see the the tail after the explosion. Where's the rest of the wreck?? I usually think that Hugo Weaving is a good and interesting actor, but in this one he acts like he's on his first audition ever. I guess he portrayed Vino the way he should, but I would have liked it better if he was even more vicious against his enemies. Overall: An interesting movie poorly made."

","When ""V for Vendetta"" came out, maybe reviews called it the first pro-terrorist movie of the post-9/11 world. And seeing what kind of society the movie portrays, it's hard not to sympathize with the terrorist (or is he a freedom fighter?).<br/><br/>The movie portrays an arch-totalitarian England sometime in the future. Because of the wars waged by the United States, the whole world exploded into war, the US got reduced to a third world country, and the fascistic Adam Sutler (John Hurt) seized power in England. Imposing devout Christianity on everyone, he rules with the slogan ""England prevails!"".<br/><br/>However, Sutler's days just might be numbered. A masked man known only as V (Hugo Weaving) seeks to overthrow this dictator on November 5, to commemorate Guy Fawkes trying to blow up parliament. V had gotten disfigured some years earlier from an explosion in a chemical plant where he was a test subject, and thus wears this mask.<br/><br/>One night, V rescues young Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) from Sutler's thugs, and slowly but surely draws her into his world of rebellion. As it is, Evey has a reason to go along with V: her parents were political activists murdered by Sutler's forces. So what will this all come down to? I must say that this movie really draws you in. While uneasy about supporting terrorist activity, one realizes that there's no alternative. Naturally, that brings up the issue of the current state of the world. Is Sutler Bush, we may ask. (No, Sutler actually has a brain.) I think that my favorite line in the movie is ""We report the news, not fabricate it. That's the government's job."" All in all, this gives movies based on graphic novels a really good name. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie. Also starring Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry and Tim Pigott-Smith."
"newbrother","10","4","8","3 August 2006"," An anthem...
","So many films that start as novels fail in their transition to the big screenso, it is always a pleasure to see one that succeeds. ""V for Vendetta"" is even more surprising because it started life not as a typical novel, but as a ""graphic novel,"" an extended comic book of sorts. While that might imply a trite or childish story, the protagonist, V, is no super empowered, comic-book hero, but a real man, with real limitations, and real passionspassions that would make Thomas Paine proud. While the original story had overtones of a socialist response to Thatcher's England, the film version is as libertarian, and as American, in passion, as one could imagine. Given the current dismal politic of America, it is perhaps astonishing, and encouraging, that the film appeared at all. Still, stranger things have happened: At the height of Mussolini's fascism, Ayn Rand's pro-individualist novel, ""We, The Living,"" was produced and distributed in Italy. In the same surprising fashion, ""V for Vendetta"" has managed to appear in America, much to my personal delight. I have just finished watching the film for the third time, and I cannot imagine a more entertaining celluloid manifesto on the importance of individualism and human liberty."
"gradyharp","8","4","8","3 August 2006"," A Spot-On Movie for our Time
","Though the packaging of both the theatrical release and the DVD suggest that V FOR VENDETTA is yet another action hero comic book foray, nothing could be further from fact. James McTeigue has directed this Wachowski Brothers adaptation of Alan Moore's comic book into a story that is intelligent, frightening, spectacularly produced and acted and the result is a fable for our minds to consider.<br/><br/>Swooping out of the time in England in 1605 for some background as to the mission of our hero, V (Hugo Weaving) appears as a masked grinning man who uses terrorist tactics to take down a British government as corrupt as any one might imagine. The time is 2020 and England rules in a totalitarian manner, its greatest enemy, the United States, has self destructed, and the government controls the lives and thoughts of the British citizenry. One remnant of the government's destructive forces is a beautiful girl Evey (Natalie Portman) who rapidly becomes V's apprentice/accomplice in the fight against the corrupt powers. The police (Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves) work to capture V and Evey, thinking they are terrorists out to destroy the government. But the heads of state (John Hurt et al) fanatically attempt to brainwash the populace through the television madness of a talk show host. Gradually the horrors of the current regime are revealed and it is a case of the good guys versus the bad guys with Portman and Weaving towering in importance by the end of the film. The quality of acting form this fine cast (including such actors as Stephen Fry among many others) is first class, making the potential silliness of the story dissolve into horror.<br/><br/>Well crafted films such as this serve the public well: sometimes it takes a visual depiction of the 'comic book look' of government officials to make us more sensitized to the direction we could be taking. It is an entertaining, fine movie - but it is more importantly a red flag warning we should all be heeding! Grady Harp"
"crazymonkeys_2004","10","4","8","3 August 2006"," An incredible film. Highly recommended!
","This has to be one of the best films i have ever seen and rank it as one of my favourites. Set in an England which is under the control of a totalitarian dictatorship, it tells the story of the mysterious figure V and his struggle for freedom against the government. Hugo Weaving plays V superbly while Natalie Portman plays Evey, who is saved by V from some nasty characters and who eventually decides to join V in his vendetta. I don't think the trailers for this film do it justice, so the only thing i can say to do is to see the film itself. I cannot think of anyone better to play V than Hugo Weaving. He has some incredible lines and is just brilliant all the way through. Stephen Fry also stars in this film, with scene stealing moments. The end sequence for this film is rousing and inspiring and brings the film to a great conclusion. I'll say again if i haven't already said it, go and see this film NOW!"

"Nedimovnet","9","4","8","1 August 2006"," Political and dramatic yet very unique
","This movie is what I would refer to as a sneak and peak into the future. Why? Take a look at the world today. Our privileges are being slowly but surely cut off. This means that in a not so distant future we will discover that this movie is telling us the truth. I find this movie entertaining and very interesting because I ask my self the very question that has haunted my mind since the first time I saw it. Is V really a terrorist or a freedom fighter? Is this what the future will bring us? Some people would probably find this movie as a typical hero movie where the good guy is fighting the bad guys. I say that these people fail to se where V for Vendetta kicks in. This movie is not what you see in an everyday motion picture where the hero is just a hero. Even though V is wearing a Fawkes mask he is not just a hero. Let's discuss that for a minute. Why is he wearing a Fawkes mask? The Fawkes mask is a symbolical thread and V chooses to wear this mask to remind the people what he is fighting for. The same things Guy Fawkes fought for. Freedom and a better future. Maybe I'm wrong but it occurs to me that V has simply forgotten who he is. He knows what he is fighting for but he has maybe chosen to forget who he was. As you very well know V had his face burned off in the explosion where he was kept as a prisoner. That's a symbol too because his face tells us who he is. V is certainly not an ordinary man anymore but more like a rebel just like Guy Fawkes. V knows what happened the 5. Of November 1606 and he is fighting for the same things. He doesn't just want to blow up the Parliament but he is trying to remind the people of what they have become and what they have forgotten. Remember, remember the 5. Of November The gunpowder treason and plot I know of no reason why gunpowder treason Should ever be forgot When we hear this little song from V we know what is about to happen. He prevails where others have failed."
"filmfan92","9","4","8","31 July 2006"," One of the year's best
","Excellent. Plain and simple. The story is that of a terrorist, V (An Oscar nod is in order for Hugo Weaving), who drags a civilian (Natalie Portman, pulling off a convincing British accent) into his guerilla war with a totalitarian government. The many taboos (abusive priests, gay sex) that are brought up in the film service the story, as opposed to simply fueling a political fire. The fights are directed with panache by James Mcteigue, who makes a first rate debut, and the set design is appropriately gloomy. The soundtrack carries the film, and it manages to have a beating heart beneath the political propaganda. V gets my vote."

Don't get me wrong, I am not one to support terrorism or destruction for any reason. I am just pointing out how beautifully done this movie is. It also, appeals to many people.

","The reason this movie is great, is because it does a great jobs showing what can happen when people decide to give up their rights and freedom for a promise by a person or political party, that they will protect them. But it will be necessary for you to give up this right to do this, or that. You'll have to have a curfew, or be convinced that you should turn your neighbors in if they seem a little suspicious. But it's all necessary to get that ""bad guy"", or ""terrorist"", or ""enemy."" That's why this was a great movie, because it showed that things aren't always as they seem, or as our leaders say they are, and that we should do some critical thinking for ourselves and not just follow like sheep.<br/><br/>""A society that will trade a little liberty for a little order will lose both, and deserve neither""<br/><br/>-Thomas Jefferson-"

","This film is not quite what I expected but was still one of the best I've seen. Yet it does have certain holes. For example, for all this environment of suppression and oppression blah blah blah, we see very few or no actual examples of those really happening during the movie. Sutler does not really come across as someone you'd hate, fear and despise, rather, he looks sad and pathetic. The second thing is that too much attention is given to explicitly portraying and exaggerating current political topics namely, the Koran being banned and the priest being..you know. They look too intentional in terms of finger pointing. This movie does not have too much action so don't go expecting the same. Lets hope that you are'nt already too familiar with Shakespearean dialogue too."
"Ultra-violence","7","4","8","2 May 2006"," The rise to overthrowing power has begun...
","After a disappointing attempt in making The Matrix into a totally forgettable trilogy, the Wachowski brothers write a new film tackling the issues of terrorism and corruption between the bureaucratic governments in this futuristic look of Britain. I am a big fan of the original Matrix and how they tackle the contextualized version of religious undertone of Neo as ""the one"" was great, so I would have only high expectations for this film. As for new cumber James McTeigue, who served as an assistant director on the Matrix films, I was impressed with the outcome of his new born film.<br/><br/>In a state of government that is controlled by a tyrant and is in a state of civil war, there's nowhere safe for anyone that is a possible suspect of terrorism. With corrupt leaders and crooked officers, there is only one thing that is suspected of this and that is the right to rebel against the government. Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman, Episode 3: Attack of the Clones) becomes cornered in a dark alley by several government officers who have only one thing on their mind. Luckily she is saved from the power hungry officers by a man in black that wears the a Guy-Fawkes mask and whose weapon of choice is the dozen of daggers that he carries around. She's intrigued by the man in black, who has no second thought of using violence as a mean of expression for his rebellious ideas, who latter has been labeled as the terrorist of the new generation and given the name ""V"". With her curiosity, Evey is kidnapped by V and learns of his lifestyles that he carries on. Meanwhile, Inspector Eric Finch, (Stephen Rea, Breakfast on Pluto) is questioning the authority of the nations dictator Creedy, whose face is blown up on a large movie screen as he dictates his committee, displaying his ego and attempt to be intimidating to his council. All I can picture is that this guy is probably 5'1'', drives cars that are large and fast, and makes sure to be yelling and/or frowning at the same time. As the film continues, you begin to learn the reasoning for V's acts of terrorism involving explosions of national monuments and the mentality that violence is the only way to rebel.<br/><br/>The pace of the film isn't what you would expect from the previews but that doesn't change anything. Coming from a comic strip of the early 80's, the film shows the stylistic traits of a graphic novel that seems to be the new wave of interpretation as seen through most recent films such as The History of Violence and Sin City. There are several high class references in V's humble layer, underneath the rocky ledge near the coast of some river, being that there are rare paintings on the wall, operatic music playing in the background and other nick-nacks that show the intellect that V truly is, giving him the approval rating for his actions. Even though he seemed to be justifying the rights of all mankind in this totalitarian government, it seems like I've heard or seen this story before at least a half a dozen times, I don't seem to mind. The ending is what ties everyone together and the effect that V had on society is what is special about the film and shows the overpowering force of the people against a tyrant. To sum it up John Locke would approve with the idea, disapprove of the actions, while Machiavelli would be frustrated beyond belief. A great look at the rise and fall of power in a time were the nation is trying to understand what there future might evolve into."

","This movie is after all not so bad, but it lacks everything that stirs inside me after an 'interesting' movie. Well, you should say 'it not the movie stupid', 'it is you', but however...Along visual pleasure, a movie should scratch something on your memory or emotions, so that you can connect with the fictional world. Sadly, the only thing that leaves me with something is Portman who is a perfect vulnerable actress close to the flirtatious Scarlet Johanson in Match Point.<br/><br/>As for the Utopian nightmare, London as a Leninist brave-new-world-1984 meets Matrix-goes-to-the-opera is anyway my kind of 'bullocks'. Yet this nightmare is a corny fantasy as long as the authoritarian/totalitarian context is totally misconceived.

I expected this movie to be like all the other super hero movies, but it wasn't. Far from that, actually. Even though I am a guy, I practically fell in love with V's character, and this is something I am not afraid of admitting. He was so entertaining in every way. I'm not saying Evey's character wasn't well played, it's just that my interest for V dragged away my attention from her.<br/><br/>There were a lot of great visual effects. They were so well made that I couldn't tell what was what. I really love how well the choreography of the fights were as well. I couldn't get over how great they were.<br/><br/>What can I say?

Well, when it comes out on video, then, needless to say, each of us are buying a copy of it. Our friend even commented that it was too perfect to ruin by watching any deleted scenes that might come on the disk.<br/><br/>The characters are amazing. The plot is amazing! Everything about this movie is amazing. It makes you really think about what is going on in today's world. Especially important is the fact that people are being prosecuted for what they believe in. For having a Qu'ran (please excuse the possible butchered spelling), you would be killed. That's almost like post-9-11 America. Also, the riots in the streets? That's going to happen if gas prices continue to rise. Yellow Coded Curfew? Sounds a bit to me like the terror alert level! There's a lot of important and RELEVANT things this movie has to say.<br/><br/>Anyone who doesn't like this movie is probably an idiot. It makes you think. It's NOT about humor, sex, romance.

","Being a fan of the comic, I was greatly disappointed in what the Wachowski Bros. did to the story. Not much of the original is intact other than the basic plot. Subtle hints to V's identity are now blatant signs, and the almost hidden love story is now a sappy romance novel and the dark, gritty aesthetic of the comic is now slick, glossy Matrix-styled Hollywood. Even if you haven't read the comics, this movie is lacking in the way it tries to be subversive by hitting you over the head with it's morality. When it begins to become thought-provoking, rather than let you form your own opinion, it blatantly shows you the way. This could have been done in a much more subdued manner, rather than as an action movie with high-end special effects."
"Bwim","8","4","8","15 April 2006"," 'V' for Very good.
","If, like me, the name Wachowski simply means The Matrix trilogy then be prepared to have your expectations confounded. Written by the brothers and directed by James McTeigue 'V' is an exercise in restraint on the part of both parties and it pays off. The marque of The Matrix was its gratuitous use of CGI and its incontinent level of nouveau-hippy cod philosophical clap-trap; thankfully 'V' relies on neither of these schlock crutches. The CGI, in terms of fight scenes, is kept to a minimum and the dialogue is fairly crisp and, overall, 'V' has a similar tone to Alex Proyas's 'Dark City' on which Mc Teigue was second assistant director.<br/><br/>Another strength of the film is its cast, largely unknown to a U.S. audience, of British actors and, thus, is not a 'star vehicle' while Natalie Portman proves, if proof be needed, that she is not just a pretty face. John Hurt's essential character is also mostly seen mediated by other screens and not encountered directly; a nice touch.<br/><br/>There are gaps in the story:for example, how did 'V' manage to get all the masks made in such an authoritarian environment? I wasn't sure, also, how 'V' got his powers such as they are (restraint again I suspect).<br/><br/>Despite and because of the above 'V' is well worth seeing."
"kbell","10","4","8","14 April 2006"," this wonderful film may now be illegal
","Why are films of comics and graphic novels among the most thought-provoking made today? I saw this with my family at the very last screening in Nottingham and wasn't sure what to expect, as some of the reviews were pretty damning. The ideas sounded interesting, however, and the French website looked terrific, so I thought we'd give it a go.<br/><br/>It was totally gripping, both in terms of plot and action (I hadn't read the graphic novel so didn't know where it was going) and in terms of the high-level intellectual engagement it demanded. It is probably more relevant now than when it was originally due for release. There were moments when it evoked recent events and debates. It got us all thinking about democracy and the relationship between government and people - and about our responsibility to resist injustice and how this should be done. (I'm a pacifist, by the way. I'm also a woman in my fifties so not the obvious viewer for this film.) However, this film may now be illegal in Britain. One of our latest anti-terrorism laws, which came into force yesterday, makes ""glorifying terrorism"" a criminal offence. And that's another reason to see this film soon."
"romper-2","8","4","8","7 April 2006"," True to the intent
","Finally - an Alan Moore story that hasn't been butchered by Hollywood. Unlike The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, this film has been made by people who like and understand the themes within the novel, and it's good to see what is arguably the best graphic novel (disregarding Neil's Sandman series ) brought to the general public who - by all accounts - seem to be very receptive to the themes (for some strange reason).<br/><br/>It's not obviously as good as the novel which includes more and varied themes that are not even touched on in the movie. The end is let down by the Wachowski treatment which wants to make some sort of superhero matrix-like fight sequence as a highlight of a big-bang action ending. Totally unnecessary, as is a bit of Hollywood schmaltz at the finale. However, overall, the writing is tight and sharp and it's still so much a film for our times, as it was one for the Thatcherite period. Obviously fascist tendencies are an integral part of government - that desire for total control over the population, which is increasingly seen as little more than a tax base and a means of supporting privilege among the few who deserve it (since they were the ones smart enough to rise to a position of power)."
"jmc4769","7","4","8","2 April 2006"," Republicans won't like this movie
","Make no mistake, this is a politically motivated movie. If you are one of the dwindling number of people who still support George Bush, don't waste your money and time. You would probably think that V for Vendetta is rubbish. On the other hand, if you liked ""Syriana"" and ""Good Night and Good Luck"", it's a safe bet that you'll like this one. This movie shows that democratic institutions are no protection against totalitarianism if the people of a country are willing to trade their civil liberties for security. It shows where America could be headed if the president is allowed to continue to consolidate his power and ignore the laws of the land, all in the name of security.<br/><br/>So much for the message, is the movie any good? Surprisingly, yes. I was not expecting much based on the previews and the mixed reviews. I just couldn't imagine enjoying a movie with ""V"" in the title and a main character who wears a mask the whole time. But my son likes Natalie Portman, so my wife and I took him to see it.<br/><br/>I'm glad we did. The movie grabbed me from the start and got better as it went along. This is one of Natalie Portman's best performances and she has never looked more beautiful. Hugo Weaving makes a good intellectual hero despite the fact that he has to act without ever showing his face. That outlandish mask didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. The directing is good. McTeigue has a particularly effective street scene at the end of the movie. I liked the unpredictability of the plot. It has some totally unexpected twists. Sure, the movie is overly dramatic, but given that the stakes are so high, that didn't bother me.<br/><br/>If you are worried about the future of America or if you are apolitical and want to see a thinking person's action flick, I can highly recommend V for Vendetta."
"giahom","9","4","8","31 March 2006"," Marvelous!
","I would like to say a few words about the movie i saw a couple of hours ago. V for Vendetta. At first i would like to emphasize the fact that i am a huge fan of Natalie Portman. I think that she will live to become one of the best actresses of her, and thank god mine, time. So don't get me wrong if i am a bit over-thrilled about this movie and not objective at all. I was too with Leon The Professional and she was only 14 years old. Back to my story then, i don't want to tire you with my obsessions.<br/><br/>I think the movie is about ideas. About the liberty we people have to express our opinions freely nowadays. It's about hope for good things to come in all dire circumstances. When all hope had faded..I found many parallelisms in the movie with our world today. There were scenes when the Chancellor made speeches, that looked awful familiar with Hitler. Same colors, same passion combined with insanity, same intensity in the man's face, same rush for power. The destruction of the parliament, besides it's historic reference to England was in some way similar to the destruction of 9th of September. The fear that is brooding in the minds of the people of this world today, is the same fear that is being harvested in the minds of the people in the movie. I believe that everybody could and found that parallelism in the theater today. It was quite clear at that point that the director wanted to say something more than the comic was trying to accomplish. ""Hope is a good thing, probably the best of things""(Tim Robins - Shawshank Redemption). A line in the movie moved me, i think it moved a lot of people. ""People should not be afraid of the power of their government, the government should be afraid of the power of their people."" We see in the face of the redeemer (Hugo Weaving) a man, who is trying to wake his fellow citizens from the hibernation of their minds. To change things as they once were. He does it not only for his personal revenge, but to shake the others around him. To make a difference. Hugo says in the movie: ""I am wearing the mask for so long, i no longer remember who's beneath it."" A government that is feeding fear to it's people with misinformation, a perfect brooding machine whose crops will benefit only little. It's all about control. People with power will become more powerful, only to produce more fear over the weak-minded. I cried when William Wallace yelled Freedom in Braveheart. One person CAN change things. But it is not the person who changes things, it's the idea that he carries within. I wish i could say more about V, but i have already tired you. Maybe i'm just wrong and this was a movie about kniVes and it should have more fight scenes and more Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>But that's just me. What difference can one man make?"
"jayschlike22","7","4","8","29 March 2006"," V for Vocal Political Point
","I must admit, I expected something completely different from this film. Instead of a ""Matrix-esque"" type of action film, I found myself in a political statement film. Based on a hugely popular comic book, this movie shapes the viewers into thinking about today's political society. It presents ""Ideas"" as they stated throughout the film as the beginning of regaining control of your government. Many obvious shots at the Bush administration, Bill O'Reilly, and the Fox Network as all propaganda factors for today's government. Obvious characters formed after George Bush and Dick Cheney. They also visit terrorism in all forms, and actually state "" sometimes you have to destroy a building"". Hmmmm. 9-11 reference ? Or just trying to stir the pot on what brings HATRED. Because our masked hero admits to being a MONSTER and he had so much hate. Are we supposed to have some sympathy for those who attack us ? Or just look deeper ? Why do they hate us so much. A lot to handle from one action film, but worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>You will be disappointed if you expect all action. Some great explosions and a great grand finale showdown between the man who represents Dick Cheney, and the masked hero. Natalie Portman is superb in this by the way.<br/><br/>An above average movie, and one that will speak volumes about the political societies today..........I'm sure each country can relate some of the factors in this film to their own government's, past and present. And the movie at the end will remind you that all this just represents an ""idea"". An idea can change history and many people will die to protect or live up to an idea. The masked hero known as ""V"" actually just represents all of us. An idealistic people who will and can demand change when we need too. Do we need too demand this change now in real life ? And don't other cultures and countries have this same right too ? The viewer is left to ponder ........."

","This Shakespearean-esquire instant classic gives you a world that appears to be the collaborated work of Edgar Allen Poe, Tim Burton, and Alfred Hitchcock, although it is not.<br/><br/>It feels darkly uplifting, while offering you the light. I found this work to be the perfect reflection of a contemporary society (although contemporary time is NOT the setting for this production) on the brink of self destruction via their own attempts to better their existence through the forced sacrifice of others. <br/><br/>The main plot demonstrates the vicarious venue of a velvety-voiced villain whose verve and victorious visions vie to vent the vastly varlotous valet of vipers.<br/><br/>This work is not merely entertaining, it is thought-provoking and deeply disturbing in a way which almost calls for anarchy from the masses against a totalitarian regime which is run inside the freedoms of Democracy.<br/><br/>More drama than anything else, this work delivers great performances, beautiful execution, and a lovely flowing, blood-soaked plot.<br/><br/>It rates a 9.7/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","A hero sporting a mask eerily reminiscent of the king from the Burger King commercials (actually a Guy Fawkes mask here) who quotes Shakespeare. Natalie Portman with a shaved head. Hilarious allusions to Fox News and the Bushes. A comic book (pardon me, graphic novel) adaptation with an actual idea in mind and a strong political statement. What's not to like? ""V for Vendetta"" is a better than average genre flick that is as enjoyable for its silliness (when we first meet ""V"" he is a bit too loquacious and seems to exist only to ramble off tongue twisters) as it is for its high-mindedness. The political message may not be so bold or new (totalitarianism is bad, and we the people should rally against it through IDEAS) but it's timely and well played here.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman does a decent British accent in what is basically a natural progression of her breakthrough role in ""The Professional"" where she once again ""falls"" for a vigilante with a heart of gold in the name of vengeance. Roles in forgettable quirky comedy/dramas and her interesting turn in ""Closer"" aside, this is really her first chance to act since she was a child, and it's a joy to watch her here. It really is amazing how wasted and ill-used she was in the recent ""Star Wars"" prequels. This is the perfect type of role for her and she carries the film through its sillier parts to make it the stuff of high drama.<br/><br/>""V"" doesn't have the visual chutzpah of ""Sin City"" or the AHA! factor of the original ""Martix"" or the deep psychological complexity of ""Batman Begins,"" but it's full of great acting, big ideas, and a dense and satisfying plot played out to a proper conclusion. Brush aside some of the British stereotypes (everyone says ""bollucks"" and the people are bit too pleased by a Jack Benny style comedy sequence meant to poke fun at their Chancellor and his war on terror), some clunky pacing in the beginning, and a missed golden opportunity for a release date (remember the 5th of November? unfortunately the studio didn't) and let yourself be entertained. Sure to have a cult following, ""V for Vendetta"" is fun way to spend a few hours and just might leave you with something to think about afterward."

","Remember, remember, the fifth of November, The gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.<br/><br/>Take the stories ""1984"" and ""Atlas Shrugged"" and combine with Phantom of the Opera, and you have V for Vendetta; A Fantastic new movie from the creators of The Matrix starring Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving. Based on a 1982 comic book story by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, V for Vendetta tells the story of the world about 15 years or so from now, and how it quickly became a world of despair and tyranny, created by a compliant public, in hopes that the government can save them from everything they fear.<br/><br/>Most of the population accepts what they feel is a necessary loss of freedom in the hard times the world is facing. Those that don't are usually branded terrorist or enemies of the state and ""black bagged"" in the middle of the night by government agents, never to be heard from again. One man, known only as ""V"" (Weaving), refuses to live in such a world. Believing that ""people should not fear their governments, governments should fear their people"", V single handedly purses a vendetta for liberty against those individuals in power responsible for the new world order. In a very ""John Galt"" like address to the nation, V starts to shake the citizens from their complacency, helping them to realize they only have themselves to blame for the situation they are in, but it is also only their willingness that allows it to continue. Circumstances tie V to Evey Hammond (Portman), a young woman who knows what is going on in the world is wrong, but is too scared to do anything about it. The story follows her individual journey from fear to realizing freedom of the mind is more important than even life itself. This movie may be build as an action film, but I see it as a love story. Not in the traditional sense of between two people, but in a Randian way between people and ideas.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the most powerful movies about liberty I have ever seen. I have seen this movie twice now and both times I have had to keep myself from standing up and cheering at the end. I am very heartened by the positive response I have heard from everyone I have talked to that has seen this movie. V for Vendetta is rated ""R"", but I would still recommend it to anyone old enough to understand the ideas presented in this film. The second time I saw it I brought my 15 year old son, and I would have brought my 13 year old daughter, if I thought she would have understood it. To all my family and friends that don't quite understand why I am involved in the libertarian movement, this movie is for them. These are the reasons I devote so much time and energy to that cause. Seeing these ideas so strongly displayed in a major motion picture, gives me renewed hope that people still place a value on liberty of more than mere lip service. To anyone that supports our government's suppression of freedom in the name of a ""War on Terror"", this movie is also for them. Your Liberty, the freedom of your mind, is too precious to trade away for anything anyone else can offer you."

","This movie was just insane! I loved almost every minute of it. It has been a long time since I have seen a movie that was this well made. All of the actors and actresses do an amazing job, especially Natalie Portman (I'm a big fan).<br/><br/>The movie was very well directed, and the visual effects were unique and detailed.<br/><br/>I went into the movie thinking that it would be more of an action film, but it turned out to have much more plot than I had assumed, making it more of a drama with some really awesome action scenes mixed in :).<br/><br/>Of course, there were a few lines in the movie that were a little korny which took away from the moment, but I must say I left the theatre with only positive thoughts. This is definitely a must see!"
"ven2s","10","4","8","23 March 2006"," Why the Controversy??
","This was an excellent movie and probably most if not all of the reviews have said this. So why do some see this as a movie glorifying terrorism, rather than one denouncing tyranny and unjust governments?? This is a rallying cry for oppressed people to stand up against those who oppress them, whether as an individual or as a collective whole; to me this is the theme of this movie. Was Dietrich Bonhoffer a terrorist because he aided in a plot to assassinate Hitler?? Were the Founding Fathers terrorist or revolutionaries?? I guess like some opinions, it depends on which side of history you fall on. In the end, I think ""V"" would say; ""think for yourself and come to your own conclusions."

","When I first saw this movie one week ago, I didn't really know what to think about it. I thought it was a bit strange and unreal, but at the same time very interesting. The actors were great and so were the dialogs. It was the plot that I was somewhat surprised by and at first, I didn't think it was that amazing. But when I came home from the cinema, I couldn't stop thinking about this film. And so it suddenly occurred to me that this really was a masterpiece. It is full of well-chosen words and beautiful scenes, even though I personally think it was just a bit too much to blow up The Houses of Parliament... <br/><br/>I can't wait to see it again."
"hknakna","9","4","8","22 March 2006"," I felt I needed to say this.
","I don't often write comments but this moment deserves to be noted by all who will.<br/><br/>As a film, there is much to recommend it and yet it is flawed. I would say that there is too much glamor, too much Hollywood show-offiness(if I may be allowed to make up my own words). That said, I get that that's probably the best way to reach the masses who crave the trendiest of forms. To be irrelevant, I actually am not that impressed by Miss. Portmans performance, truly, her poor accent is a distraction. I think the cinematography is good, the acting, overall, good. the pacing is good in short this is a good movie.<br/><br/>It actually disappoints me to read the too long paragraphs describing line for line this movie not to mention the whining about how it's not exactly like the comic(big surprise). I don't think we should miss the the point here, as many of our leaders hope, by getting all caught up in trivialities. I would like to ask that we all send a silent thank you to all the parties involved in bringing this film to the people. I believe I spent most of this film with mouth open in shock. I almost felt that they(the makers) and we(the viewers) were going to face some sort of repercussions. I guess I have our new constitution aka the ""Patriot Act"" to thank for that.<br/><br/>Some things transcend their form and it no longer matters about the elements that made it, all that matters are the lingering effects. I felt it as I am sure many of you did. Subtlety no longer seems to affect the hardened shells of the grotesquely apathetic, only a sledge hammer will do. We are not yet at the stage of complete totalitarianism brought about by the fear driven message of justice by faith. we still have a chance before the task becomes tragically difficult.<br/><br/>Go and see it. It's important."
"dmhawkin","6","4","8","20 March 2006"," This is a good movie but....
","I read a review of this movie that said only ignorant people would not like this movie. I found more to like than to dislike in this movie, but this movie suffers from the same problem most religious movies do. When a ""message"" is sent by a movie more than a ""story"" only true believers are going to find the movie inspiring. Is this reviewer (i saw a quote on William Gibson's blog, I'm not sure who it was who wrote the review) really willing to say that if someone doesn't like this movie that person is ignorant? As I said I mostly liked this movie, but I must be borderline ignorant because the preachiness really annoyed me and distracted from what could have been a clearer statement of the idea that people voluntarily give up their freedom, when that freedom is what they should fight for. Conservatives should not be angered by this idea any more than liberals. The regime in this movie had conservative origins, but historically there have been as many emerging from the left. Remember that both communism and fascism spawned dictatorships, and when anyone closes down dialog (be that through fear of wire tapping or through calling someone who didn't like a movie ignorant, come on, its so subjective) because of a knee jerk response, is denying someone else their freedom. The tone of this movie is clearly anti-conservative, and while there is much to be feared from that front, the left can be just as divisive, just as restrictive, can follow the party line as mutely and fearfully. I'm not saying its wrong to question the current administration, because I think they've done and are doing some crazy things. I'm saying this is a good movie that could have been great if the story, which was compelling, had not turned into a diatribe against the republicans. Ironically this movie would have been able to make people question their assumptions more if it hadn't been so hateful toward republicans. That being said there were some amazing things in this movie. The TV parody of the chancellor with the Benny Hill music, V's first televised speech, the visual effect of the dominoes with the one left standing that surprised V, were all things I loved, but would have been more effective in the context of a story that was more a story about human tendencies than a story which functions as an ideological attack."
"jhawksmoor","10","4","8","19 March 2006"," Surprising and exciting.
","This movie was startling. It managed to twist the Phantom of the Opera with Equilibrium and add a dash of 1940's style fascism in for flair.The character V is surprisingly sympathetic and emotional for a guy covered head to toe. Body language really does say a lot. The acting was superb, Natalie won me over with this picture. I was worried about her being in it after the Star Wars thing. The action scenes were sharp. Good, visceral shots, and more importantly, thoughtfully placed. Not just another mindless action flick. The storyline was gripping and well written. I didn't take a bathroom break for fear of missing something good. This movie will make you think, but it won't bore you in the process."
"spectral_scream","10","4","8","18 March 2006"," More Than Worth the Price of Admission
","This was, in my opinion anyroad, an excellent movie! The way it was written, performed, and edited keeps the same entrancing air of the original comics. Heartbreaking, tense, action-packed, and even morbidly humorous at times, it truly was unique. Admittedly, there were changes and omissions, but one must keep in mind that there is only so much that can be done in a two-hour movie, as opposed to a multiple-volume comic series. Not overly surprising, that. I must say, however, that it is refreshing to see Vertigo getting its day in the sun, so to speak. V For Vendetta also does it an amazing amount of justice. Constantine was a good movie, when taken separately from the graphic novels. Vendetta is a good movie, with or without the graphic novels. Even the acting, which can sometimes be frightening in this genre of movie, was phenomenal. Natalie Portman and Hugh Weaving were perfect.<br/><br/>There is really no question, it is a movie worth watching, and parts will leave you breathless."
"p_mcmanis","10","4","8","18 March 2006"," Absolutely brilliant
","I imagine that many people will not like this movie. Those people, I'm afraid, dislike it because of some preconceived idea that they will not like it. What I write here is of no value to them, and in that regard, it is somewhat meaningless. People with an open mind will thoroughly enjoy this movie. As just a movie it is exceptional; Hugo Weaving is fantastic, his appropriateness is perfect and his tone is rich and wonderful. Natalie Portman is strong, thoroughly convincing in her role and quite frankly I thought she did an excellent job, I did not notice any issue with her accent, its a mix of English and American and thats just how it is, remember not every British person fits the stereotype. A well thought out plot and wonderful action round out what I'm sure will be one of my all time favorites. Pacing is good, be warned, there is not as much action as you may be led to believe by the trailers but this actually makes the movie better.<br/><br/>If you, like myself, truly believe that a movie is its best when it makes you suspend your disbelief for that moment, you will not be disappointed. There are some moments that are unrealistic, or perhaps more accurately, unfeasible. No movie has ever had this effect on me as greatly as V for Vendetta, and I heartedly suggest that if you can see past it as 'just a movie' you should see it, it is worth every second of your time."

Oh yes, this is not another hero movie the way I see it so don't expect guys flying... The theme behind it is very in touch with the times we live in and the way they treated it is just impeccable. You could definitely say that the way they portray the future is tangible and the way they suggest to confront it, or live with it, is an exact replica of what I stand for. Hope you feel the same I felt with this movie because I really think it can makes us fathom that there are ways out of this farce we call control, government, lifestyle, you name it. Chau!"
"jgerontes","10","4","8","18 March 2006"," Fantastic, ,but not perfect.
","V for Vendetta is certainly one of the best movies that have been released recently. It encapsulates a not-too far-off picture of what might happen to the world in the future. The action sequences made their presence known, but were not the entire focus of the entire movie as the Matrix (s) seemed to be. Unfortunately, there were some problems with the movie. For one, it seemed that the creators of the movie were attempting to focus on too many subjects at once (fascism, anti-homosexual feelings, war on terror)which left the viewer scrambling to digest the message. Additionally, the movie deviated from the graphic novel substantially in the ending. But unlike recent ground-breaking movies, V for Vendetta did not forcefully shove everything down our throats, leaving it up to the viewer to decide which the right path to follow was. This movie makes the viewer think, and that is what is important, too few movies make people truly think about the message."
"djohnk-1","10","4","8","18 March 2006"," Excellent movie
","I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this movie. The previews being shown on TV make it look like an action movie. Don't get me wrong there is a lot of action that takes place but there is a lot more to it. This movie makes you think as well. It was nice to see Natalie Portman in a role that was so far removed from Padme (""Star Wars""). She does an excellent job. Hugo Weaving (Elrond from the Lord of the Rings trilogy) is also brilliant, he has to rely on his acting skill and not his expressions since you never see his face beyond the mask. This movie is an excellent thriller and I would highly recommend it, if you do have a problem with graphic violence however you might like to stay away."
"RandomTask-AP","10","4","8","18 March 2006"," Violent, disturbing, and unusually patient, ""Vendetta"" reaches its film-making ambitions and makes its message heard.
","Someone once said that great ideas do not succeed without loyalty between individuals. (I'm paraphrasing.) There are many great ideas floating through the film incarnation of ""V for Vendetta"", and the protagonist, V, is a compelling individual who draws the audience into his strange existence and inspires, at the very least, fascination. V (played marvelously by the masked and enigmatic Hugo Weaving) is agile and strong, educated and articulate as well as poetic, romantic and cultured. Not only can he fence, discuss music, talk about classic films, but he's a wiz in the kitchen. He is a definitive Renaissance Man who just happens to be wholeheartedly insane.<br/><br/>This story takes place in the totalitarian England of a not-too-distant possible future. It's a place where a disaster has allowed people to be consumed by fear of the outside world. Chancellor Adam Satler (John Hurt) is the unquestionable authority of this new era and channels Hitler as he booms orders over a Soviet-style regime with cutting-edge technologies. People scrabble about to keep up as much of a normal 21st century life as they can. Evie (Natalie Portman) is on her way to a dinner when three policemen stop and threaten her for no other crime than being out past curfew. V comes to her rescue and invites her in sincerely gentlemanly fashion to join him for a special event. The newly acquainted pair watches as V's explosives blow the historic Bailey Building to pieces as viewing London is treated to a recording of The 1812 Overture. Naturally, Evie is appalled, and although V keeps his word to return her home safely and goes on his way, another chance meeting irrevocably entwines their respective paths as investigated by the cynical Chief Inspector Finch (Steven Rea).<br/><br/>Hurt and Weaving as The Chancellor and V portray the flip sides of the same coin. They are men of force. One gathers power by instilling fear. The other instills hope by inflicting revenge on those he sees as the guilty. Steven Rea's Inspector Finch already knows how badly this world is run. He is cynical of the government, his place in it and what chance he might have to change it. The journey his character is on also illustrates many things about this world and where he is going in it, and it is a subtle and gradual performance. As Evie, Natalie Portman brings the audience into the nightmarish world and the increasingly nightmarish situations in which she finds herself. She makes every scene work, not just as a plot device, but more importantly for the character. There is even a scene in which Evie experiences an awakening not dissimilar to Neo in ""The Matrix"". She is viewing the world with entirely new eyes. However, instead of playing off of scenery full of scary machine monsters as Keanu Reeves did, Portman creates the moment standing alone in front of the camera; swamped and drowning in emotion.<br/><br/>Controversy has been the buzzword surrounding ""VfV"" during the run up to the film's release. It has been said that this movie is taking aim squarely at the Bush administration here in the US. It's not. It's also not talking about Tony Blair's current administration nor is it reflecting upon the unpopular Thatcher administration, which was in office at the time Alan Moore and David Lloyd created the graphic novel on which this is based. Nor are the filmmakers endorsing terrorism as the best way of altering a government any more than a dentist would recommend eating more candy for healthier teeth. What I believe director James McTiegue is trying to illustrate in his work with the Wachowskis' adapted script is the very need for revolution in thought when fear becomes the predominant theme in a society. <br/><br/>The Chancellor is seen mostly as a huge projected talking head barking orders and making frantic threatening demands. The government and military follow suit, but only out of the fear of retribution. While V is certainly not a passive figure, he radiates calm in even in a fight; no motion is wasted. V sees himself made more a reactionary than an instigator, and this refined masculinity is proved genuine as we view how he behaves in his own home with Evie. V disrupts with violence, but he appeals with conversation and ownership of his actions. He is attempting to inspire people from their fear and lethargy.<br/><br/>Although there are frightening images, such as V's birth by fire and Evey's torture, McTiegue's camera, too, is sparing with its motion and reserved with the space it permits the story's characters. There are close-ups during intimate and poignant moments. The action sequences are startling in their ferocity and executed with all the expertise expected from the assistant director of ""The Matrix"" series. In many scenes, the camera frames up an entire room and sits still. Even moves following someone down a hall or across a floor are done out of necessity and without excess flourish or unusual angles. The characters and situations are allowed to do the talking. Control and patience are the dazzling features here.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, some people will always take inspiring fiction (written or filmed) as fact or mandate, but this is a comic book world with comic book rules and brutal action  though action does not occur as often as one might expect. This is a comic with ideas in its head. If it just so happens that people find similarities between the film and current governments in the world, maybe that says something about the real life situation to which they are comparing it. If one finds a government is not living up to expectation, maybe it's time to start running for office or working for causes. This is a film with a big point to make, and takes risks making it. It's rare that a studio film is as driven as its main character.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

The movie never ceases to keep your attention. Even the violence in the film wasn't of your average shoot-em-up type, but a more stylized sort. The stories of the characters become those which you can empathize with; the fights the characters fight become your own; and the struggles and repressions which are laid down to smother a society are as a pillow on the face as a sleeping child to you - they repulse and infuriate.<br/><br/>After leaving this movie, I was moved ... especially to go put a slash through every ""W"" sticker I saw."

What you should expect is a clever delivery of plot, speech, and a creative spin on violence. There is a few times where something is not needed, however most of the movie is right on target, and it actually makes you fear this sort of circumstance.

The story itself is amazing, and as usual the music and filmography are perfect, as is to be expected of the Wachowski bros. Yet it lacks the repeated fight scenes of the Matrix trilogy, dropping those scenes to add more time for individual character development. The casting could not have been better, Natalie Portman lives up to my dreams with an outstanding performance that deserves nothing less than an Oscar.

(The film) is a thwarted and frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by neo-conservatives - which is not what 'V for Vendetta' was about.""<br/><br/>Indeed, I was reminded of the guys who flood the blogs with cries of Impeach Bush, as if actually booting him out will make the world safe for Ding-Dongs again. Impeach Bush, and guess who gets to be Prez? Elmer Fudd Cheney! In other words, V isn't very well thought out. Stuffed like a turkey with pretentious diatribes only Harold Pinter could love, it is a boring exercise in didactic propaganda meant to appeal to the narcissistic fantasies of teenage boys, complete with the hot babe falling for the nerd! It wants us to believe that we are living under a totalitarian regime. The irony that no totalitarian regime would ever allow V to be made is lost on those behind it! Try making a movie in Cuba that takes potshots at Papa Fidel, and see how far you get!<br/><br/>All I got out of V is that: 1) Natalie Portman wants to be Joan of Arc when she grows up; 2) the Wachowskis know how to blow things up real good; and 3) $50 million doesn't go as far as it used to! Too bad V doesn't share the romanticism of Larry Wachowski, who left his wife for a dominatrix and now lives as preoperative transsexual Laurenca! Now, THAT'S a movie just begging to be made!"

However, if you still have the slightest memory of your 6th grade History lesson, move along, you wouldn't like go over it again. With all that, I feel a bit sorry for the actors and the visual team, who really did a good job (that makes for the 4/10) <br/><br/>I got nothing against stupid action movies.

"dglas26","3","6","14","23 March 2006"," One ""Purist's"" View
","There are essentially two kinds of folks who will be seeing this film. Those who have read the original illustrated story and those who haven't. From what I've heard and read, those who haven't read the original story seem to like the film on its own merits. So be it. I cannot comment on that. I have read the original story, many times over.<br/><br/>There are some things to be liked in the film, Hugo Weaving as ""V"" is a good job casting. Given the change of character, Portman as Evey was good as well - especially the ""There's a rat"" scenes. <br/><br/>There are however some things to not like about the film. Why did the Wachowski brothers find it necessary to rewrite Evey as a closet dissident sprung from the roots of dissidence. Why did they find it necessary to dilute the Norsefire to ""Coronation Street"" level menace? The scenes of families depicted did nothing to get across the true viciousness of the Norsefire regime. So diluted was it that the re-writers found it necessary to invent crimes for the audience to dislike the regime. This, sadly, rather dilutes the point of the V character. Add to this that V is written as some kind of insecure brat, unlucky in love because of disfiguration. Perhaps the writers thought they were humanizing the character, but the whole point of V is that he represents, not a person, but an idea or set of ideas.<br/><br/>Then there is the unforgivable. There is a scene in the illustrated story in which V performs some magic tricks for Evey. During this scene, V effectively asks for Evey's permission to liberate her and she gives it - in fact demands it. This scene does not appear in the movie, nor anything like it. Frankly, I think it'd make a better scene than V preparing egg in a blanket. To make up for deleting this important scene, the Wachowski's resort to apologies. V does not apologize. Part of the point of the story is that V is more in-tune with the real desires of the people than even they are themselves. The people are not merely being kept under thumb - they have had their wills controlled.<br/><br/>Why the renaming of Adam Susan to Sutler, and why the depiction of him as a ranting Orwellian face on a big screen? Susan is methodical, ruthless, business-like fascist who rules by terror and propaganda, with far too much reliance on his surveillance methods. Much of the characterization of Susan in the story is intended to illustrate that his hold on society is tenuous at best because it doesn't have any basis in the will of the people. Susan is not a ranting psychopath, he's a dogmatic, systematic fanatic horribly distanced from humanity. Susan and V are foils for each other.<br/><br/>Was there any particular reason why V's speech to the people got so incredibly watered down? The speech was intended to place responsibility for the future, and for what has happened to England, firmly in the hands of the people.<br/><br/>The use of hundreds of Fawkes masks at the end of the film was incredibly trite and ridiculous in the extreme. Just gotta have a trite Hollywood ending, eh? The ending of the illustrated story is not that it has reached an endpoint, but that it has reached a new beginning. Replacing one icon with another is not to the point.<br/><br/>One other minor note. V is not the main character in the story. Evey is. V is simply a catalyst.<br/><br/>Perhaps the Wachowskis should have read the story first. It really is much more interesting than this. In all honestly, I think I can see, at least in part, why Moore took his name off this.<br/><br/>The good news for those who haven't read V for Vendetta and who enjoyed the movie: there's much more and much better of what this movie makes an empty shell."

","V For Vendetta (2005): Dir: James McTeigue / Cast: Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, John Hurt, Stephen Fry: Should be titled S For Stupid or I For Idiotic. Or maybe it should be called L for Leave the Theatre Before the Credits Roll for all the good it is. Lame comic remake about finality. Hugo Weaving dons a smiley mask and enacts vengeance upon a government. He receives assistance from Natalie Portman whom he rescues from being mugged. Premise is rushed but structure is detailed due to Portman's surfacing back story. Ending is the typical violence. Director James McTeigue rushes his shots as if trying to get the film shot in record time. Weaving is compelling enough as V to render a decent performance as he fights against government to the point of sacrifice. Natalie Portman is given the best section of the film. After her initial rescue she is put through numerous acts of torture where her background is revealed through flashbacks. She will ultimately become the film's true stronghold. Stephen Rea plays a detective in what becomes rather standard writing of typical investigation jargon. John Hurt plays a villain who shouts into a screen as if desperately yearning a placement on another film set. In the end this is a well made comic book adaptation that only partially works. The only vendetta left is viewers trying to get their money back. Score: 4 / 10"

","Sometimes; when reading the posts on IMDb, it becomes easier to see that common sense is possessed by a declining few.<br/><br/>Even to describe the plot of this second Guy Fawkes as 'preposterous in the extreme' would be an understatement.<br/><br/>One commentator has compared it to a production by Andrew Lloyd Webber. And given a few good songs, with the abandonment of all pretence at reality, it would have made a corking musical. A sort of 'Phantom Of The Revolution', with hints of Darth Vader, Obi Wan Kenobi, Neo, Adam Adamant, Bat Man, and The Joker all rolled into Winston Smith. As a piece of overblown, theatrical pomposity I can think of very few equals.<br/><br/>The problem is; it didn't stop there. It tried to be intelligent. And for under-fives may still seem so. It tried to be realistic; though the same class are unlikely to be fooled there. It also tried to convey a political message, with all the balance and intellectual depth of the Socialist Worker Party. Yep: that bad.<br/><br/>And I am SO tired of super-heroes, who can do just about anything. Where do they learn their skills? Where do they get their training? Why can't the SAS - who spend their lives in the business of all things espionage - do the same? There is a single-line hint that he was infected by a disease which miraculously advanced his strength and reaction times (yawn). It similarly made him a knife-throwing genius, a pyrotechnics expert, and a ghost who can pretty-well go anywhere without detection.<br/><br/>And of course; he's got to have 'issues' from the past, that require endless, tedious, soul-searching, chest-bearing denouements (double yawn). <br/><br/>To begin with; he's tapped into a communications main-frame. He's managed to smuggle about a ton of explosives into the Old Bailey, along with about £100,000 worth of display fireworks for good measure. He's managed to distribute them, conceal them, and fit them with minutely co-ordinated time-fuses. And he's apparently done this when anything bigger than a handbag is searched, and also scanned for explosive traces. Yeah, sure; in wonderland. And all the dumb-asses who've given this 8 or more stars just gawped open-mouthed in unquestioning acceptance. No explanation; just swallow like a garbage bin.<br/><br/>Reality ends there. It was not necessary to waste celluloid on any more hokey explanations. Just get on with the songs and the theatre.<br/><br/>But no; it just shuffles along. Tediously, laboriously, often presented from the standpoint of a senior detective with an IQ equal to his body temperature. The general public are depicted as the sort of gormless, gullible trinkets who consider this a good movie. We learn of his imprisonment, his escape, and so on. We don't need any of it; let's just have the songs!<br/><br/>We see the new big brother, played by an increasingly rabid John Hurt, which looks like a tongue-in-cheek homage to the 1984 movie. In a scene of unremitting confusion in a disused underground railway station, we find a train that's packed with yet more explosives. Our phantom hero has cleared the track and re-electrified it (that took him 10 years, you know). For some reason, once more unexplained, 'Big Brother' is dragged down there by his fellow authority-figures, to be murdered by the 'clot'. They then turn on him, and he proceeds to murder them all in a Tarantino-style blood bath. Though he is mortally wounded in the process.<br/><br/>Oh-yes; and there's the inevitable pretty-sweet femme-fatale who wanders about with her mouth partly agape as if in continuous expectation of providing someone with a blow-job. She, and she alone, carries this tall, well-muscled crusader onto the train and lays him on his explosives. Providing him with a wreath of red-roses, plucked out of fresh-air (if you can find any in a disused underground station). <br/><br/>The train is sent to Parliament, where the entire population of London, dressed in Guy Fawkes outfits - all supplied and shipped by courier at unlimited expense by our hero, have gathered to watch the big bang.<br/><br/>And it's a good one - the best bit of the movie. And there's another £100,000 fireworks display to go with it. To a few last lines uttered by the heroine, so clichéd as to pucker any self-respecting human sphincter, the nonsense comes to a close. <br/><br/>There's a lot more equally daft stuff but insufficient space to describe it. <br/><br/>Choreography's nice. Production values high. Special-effects spectacular, costumes and set-pieces OK. The hero is verbose but hilarious. The heroine suitably sylph-like, dumb and pretty. If only they'd remembered to put the bloody songs in. What a show it would have been."

","I had heard and seen many images of this film, so I was definitely going to give it a go, from writer and producer brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski (creators of The Matrix). The film begins with the capture and hanging of Guy Fawkes, and then forwards to a not too distant looking future (2038) Great Britain, in which a masked (with the face of Guy Fawke) known only as V - or later William Rookwood (Hugo Weaving) - blows up the Old Bailey building on November 5th. He warns everyone that in 364 days from that night, he will do what the real Guy Fawkes planned and blow up the Houses of Parliament. Orphan Evey (Natalie Portman) finds herself helping V escape from the authorities, and slowly falling for him. V by the way is a very enigmatic terrorist, or vigilante if you like, who uses a lot of poetry and Shakespearian dialect to get his points across. There is a point when she is ""captureD2 (and has her hair chopped off), when it was in fact V. Trying to find V are Inspector Finch (The Crying Game's Stephen Rea) and Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith), under the watch of their boss, a Big Brother type figure, Adam Sutler (John Hurt). So November 5th approaches, and Evey does come back to V, after he let her go, till the day of course, and he does sacrifice himself, before the streets are swarmed with hundreds of people in his image, and the Houses of Parliament blow up. Also starring Stephen Fry as Deitrich, Rupert Graves as Dominic, Roger Allam as Lewis Prothero, Ben Miles as Dascomb and Sinéad Cusack as Delia Surridge. V (which by the way in Roman numeral means five) is a very intriguing character, with knives and razors to slice up people in his way, and yet he speaks so poetically, you can't help but like him, and Weaving was the perfect choice. Portman does quite well with the English accent, and supporting cast members Rea, Hurt and Fry add some good depth, it is along the lines of something like A Clockwork Orange, Fight Club or Twelve Monkeys, very enigmatic with hidden messages, but a good film none-the-less. Good!"

If this movie were your run of the mill action hero movie, I could have given it a higher score. Unfortunately, the problem with VFV is that you cannot get behind the ""hero."" I wanted to, and tried to, but at the end of the day just couldn't. The way he brutally kills guards (even after they help him), his former foes (including an old lady who was tricked and regrets taking part in helping the fascists take over), and how he tortures Evey, I felt like V was as much of a bad guy as the antagonist he was fighting against.<br/><br/>In the end, it just falls flat. It falls flat at politics, and it falls flat at action. When an action movie tries to be thought provoking and doesn't, it can just be bad and offensive.

"sculpepper-1","4","5","11","7 December 2006"," OK, but not nearly as good as everyone seems to think it is
","Amazing! Best film of 2005! Must see! Utterly cool! Greatest film I have ever seen! Steady, people, who are we kidding here? This entertaining nonsense was just average at best.<br/><br/>That terrible, terrible Benny Hill comedy routine? Natalie Portman's laughable ""romantic"" scene where she kisses V's mask? Periodic outbreaks of appallingly stilted dialogue and wooden acting? That laboured ""we must explain in words of one syllable to the Yanks who Guy Fawkes was"" sequence at the beginning? Silly Matrix homages which hang, draw and quarter your disbelief: e.g. V's sword-fighting scene with the cops? Plot holes you could lose, well, the Houses of Parliament in? A totally pants revolution where everyone just dresses up like plonkers and gawks at fireworks? Film of the year? Really? Come on.<br/><br/>Worst of all, how does blowing up the beautiful Houses of Parliament (the ""Mother of Parliaments"" no less) strike a blow for freedom? The bad guys were all dead - all someone had to do was walk in the front door and retake the old H's of P in the name of the people.<br/><br/>Answer: narrative imperative - you gotta blow 'em up, otherwise what would have been the point of all that Guy Fawkes stuff? And, let's admit it, it was rather fun. Heaven knows how many times Hollywood has blown up the White House on screen - so it made a change.<br/><br/>The trouble is the bad guys just aren't bad and oppressive enough and V is a pretentious, prissy arse. John Hurt (as the ""chancellor"") is more pitiful than evil and all the people you see in the retirement homes, family houses and so on all look remarkably well fed, clean, disease-free and unoppressed.<br/><br/>Sure, there is the odd truly frightening moment when you see how good the film could have been. For example, the abduction of Stephen Fry's character by the secret police was particularly striking. However, most of the supposedly ""shocking"" scenes (such as that ridiculous persecuted-lesbian story) that we're supposed to recoil at seem so out of place, and are so in your face isn't-it-just-terrible-darling, that they soon become mawkish and even rather comical.<br/><br/>It has to be said that the plot was quite sophisticated and had some good twists - and some ridiculous ones. I haven't read the graphic novel, but I get the impression that much of the story was close enough to the original to satisfy most fans. The ever-watchable Stephen Rea somehow managed to keep a straight face though it all and the film was just absorbing enough for me to see it through to the end, though I nearly gave up a couple of times.<br/><br/>People, if you really want to see a couple of ""amazing, must see"" films that really bring home the terror and the absurdity of totalitarianism, watch the astonishing 1984 made in 1984 (also starring John Hurt) or try Terry Gilliam's masterpiece, Brazil."

After further discussion with a friend of mine I realized that V for Vendetta is a well thought and compelling story driven by both the characters and complex plot alike. Around every corner of this dark tale there was a statement to be made about government, people, and personal strength.

I absolutely loved the line about how V preferred the percussion instruments because I knew exactly what he was referring to. I want to see this movie over and over again until I wear out the movie theater! I know the critics believed that because Hugo Weaving wore a mask the entire time, there was no emotion and expression to his performance. His performance was masterful. It takes a lot of talent to be able to convey that type of emotion only through movement and actions and through your voice, without having people see your face. He is still able to convey exactly what he needs to, more so than some other actors I have seen without masks. When I found out who played V, I was blown away.

On no, and i mean no conceivable level does this picture work! Evey aspect from tone (did it want to be funny or was it just that woeful that i laughed when i shouldn't have?), dialogue (at times made gigli look like a Woody Allen film), casting (what the hell was Steven 'Twinings Tea' Fry doing there!) and the sound/editing (i was half expecting a special thanks credit for Michael Bay at the end!)was completely confused, inappropriate and totally void of any vision or decipherable skill.<br/><br/>Now i love Natalie Portman, those adorable ringlets in Sith and a career enhancing performance in Garden State have endeared me to her in recent years in a way i can't describe, but this, quite frankly came across like something she had been forced to do through losing a bet or something! And what the hell was that accent about, when are you Americans going to learn that Brits don't speak like that!!!! My biggest qualm with the flick however, has to be that damn mask!! Surely, even film makers of the disability of the wachowski's are aware that it is usually helpful if your movie's main character is capable of showing some facial expression at certain points of the film!! Never showing V's face completely detracts from any emotional hook the movie might have had and the scene where V 'cries' near the end is absolutely hilarious because of this. Couple that factor with an 'antagonist' that not only wastes one of our best actors in John Hurt but also provides no conflict for our hero for the whole duration of the film and you have a piece that evoked in me the feeling that i had been physically mugged of my admission fee by those cross dressing one hit wonder wachowski's and left for dead while they laughed their overblown fight sequence making heads off!!!

"Quentintarantado","8","5","11","16 March 2006"," Showing V for Vendetta in Volatile Philippines
","Now is a particularly interesting time to show V for Vendetta in Manila Philippines. <br/><br/>Bear with me. Let me give a thumbnail sketch of recent political history in the Philippines, which is as straightforward as cooked spaghetti. <br/><br/>Our present President, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, is slowly growing paranoid because she wasn't properly elected. When the previous president, Joseph Estrada, was allegedly caught ""plundering"" the Philippine Treasury, people took to the streets and protested until he got kicked out and Arroyo became president. Then in 2004, Arroyo held real elections this time, to prove she could get elected and not just do a ""Gerald Ford"". She cheated, was elected, and a year later a tape recording of her practically conniving with an election official became public. <br/><br/>Somehow because of public ennui, some savvy political spinning and sheer stubbornness, she managed to survive the crisis (barely) and held on to power.<br/><br/>Last February 25, we were celebrating the anniversary of the February Revolution, marking the time, way back in 1986, when we peacefully kicked out Ferdinand Marcos after he'd been dictator for 20 years. During this year's February Revolution celebration, Arroyo learned of a new coup attempted, and created presidential decree 1017, saying she can close media who are saying something she doesn't like, and she can break up any mass protests. She also arrested known communists and several political opponents under the excuse that they were plotting a coup against her. <br/><br/>Then that same weekend, the Philippine Marines barricaded themselves in their barracks and complained that their commander was unfairly linked to the coup attempt and was replaced. That was also resolved peacefully, but you get the point. The atmosphere right now is ugly. Everyone is frustrated and tense and people are in a ""dare me"" mood, their patience frayed, their tempers are on a hair trigger. <br/><br/>I think she's ignoring this V for Vendetta at her peril. I can imagine her dismissing this ""It's only a film!""<br/><br/>I was watching Vendetta and I was wondering about similarities. The ending was prettier than our original February Revolution, with all those matching masks, but yes, we did walk past barricades, yes the police held their fire. There were no picturesque fireworks to mark the victory, but one frail dictator in a helicopter was good enough for us. Whatever it takes. <br/><br/>I saw the torture scenes and I remember the stories of people (some I even knew personally) who'd experienced similar things. When I was a kid, we also had curfews for a long time. We also heard of the stories of how the privileged, the people in power, had Mercedes Benzes, imported tinned goods, Gucci, Dior, all the stuff that were not only expensive, but unavailable to the politically not connected. <br/><br/>I was watching Vendetta and I was wondering about possibilities, if we could all be outraged again, if we could remember what it was like before she came along, if we could believe that we deserve better leaders because we are not scum of the earth and I remember a saying that people deserve the leaders they elect. We don't deserve her, and we need to show it to everyone. <br/><br/>She's one. She's scared. She's outnumbered. We're many, but dispersed and unfocused. We need to rally together around someone, some symbol. <br/><br/>To be realistic, I don't think this movie will do it. Only the middle class watch movies. Seventy percent of the population, the poor, will watch other movies in Tagalog, or listen to the radio. Movies are bourgeois entertainment. <br/><br/>Maybe some incident, something that will make everyone mad, like the accidental shooting of a little girl. Something will ignite the situation. Maybe in the next six months, something drastic will happen again. SHE knows it. That moled midget. It's only a matter of time. <br/><br/>V for Vendetta, written in the 80's, read in the 90's, filmed in the new millennium, reminding me of possibilities. Hmmm...."

But this movie was a surprise. Portman does very well, as she always does except for George Lucas's moves (I love the prequels but that man is NOT an actor's director), Portman plays a British character who has witnessed violence as a child and develops a rapport with Codename V.<br/><br/>The movie explores a lot of socio, econo, and geopolitical themes all done in comic-book flavor as what is expected from a movie scribed by the Wachowskis. Even first time helmer McTeigue hints at using the brother's style in slo-mo violence, which surprisingly works well in here as it is something NOT to my taste all the time. I hated slo-mo in John Woo's movies and in The 3rd Matrix film, I thought it became just too overwrought styling. The movie opens with action scenes that expose the grace and adeptness of Codename V as a vigilante? Or antihero? Whatever. And there is a surprise in the middle that draws denouement to the subplot of Evey (Portman) being captured, and tortured and being basically left for dead.<br/><br/>John Hurt does an excellent job as the movie's antagonist, he displays an imposing persona, arrogant and full of conviction - whom we would then witness seeing a reversal in character in the end by the way. The film flash backs the character's past, from the trauma Evey has witnessed from childhood, to the incident that made Codename V who he was, thus revealing the driving force of the movie's title character. In one of the scenes preceding a flashback, we see the slyness of his methods of assassination when he speaks to a coroner who has bore witness to V's wrathful rebirth. The movie has a recurring theme of fate versus coincidence and pays off what is foreshadowed in the beginning. Listen to V's speech as he invades television and see the symbolic chain reaction of collapsing dominoes, a visual metaphor that precedes the film's climax. There is denouement between V and Evey, where Evey even takes on totally the ideals that Codename V has upheld. A symbol is nothing without the people.<br/><br/>This is a very good piece of cinema, worth watching if you have the time and does have gravitas in it. The 3rd film of the Wachowski's trilogy may NOT have clicked because it was an attempt at making something intellectual in a genre for dumbs. VENDETTA is of that same genre, and like Revolutions, efforts of the scribes pay off and they do well in the fact that this movie even surpasses anything good or redeeming that 3rd film of the Matrix trilogy had. Vendetta is a better and more exciting watch. And very impressive for first time captain of the boat, James McTeigue who has worked alongside the brothers in their movies as a second-unit man.<br/><br/>Grade B+"

","""V for Vendetta"" by James McTeigue is arguably one of the most controversial movies filmed during the early 2000s. The movie was very popular in the early 2000s and Natalie Portman earned a few awards for her acting in the movie. ""V for Vendetta"" is a drama film based on the Guy Fawkes story as he tried to destroy Parliament in 1605. In the film ""V"" is an anarchist with the intention of fulfilling Guy Hawkes plan to blow up Parliament on November 5th. V wears a Guy Hawkes mask during the entire movie to show that he is finishing what Hawkes started. The film was made to illustrate the importance of fighting for your rights and what will happen if you let the government take them away. The film seems far fetched, but with all the control the government has, we may not be too far from a similar situation.<br/><br/>The movie is set in 2020 in the United Kingdom. The story follows a masked man named ""V"" (Hugo Weaving) and emphasizes his disapproval towards the totalitarian government. V met a young woman named Evey (Natalie Portman) and she joined him along his one year journey to destroy Parliament in hopes of rebuilding a fair government in the UK. Evey was forced to join V on his journey because he rescued her and took her to his underground shelter and did not allow her to leave after because she knew where he resided. V explained to Evey his plan of destroying Parliament and she was skeptical at first, but V explained issue of the government having more control than they should. V killed all the people responsible for torturing him (mostly members of Parliament) at Larkhill Resettlement Camp because they made him into the monster he was. V died in the end after fighting to regain the rights of the citizens that were not able to fight for themselves. In the end, Evey placed V in a train full of explosives, which he put together himself, and sent him off underneath Parliament and his goal of blowing up Parliament was successfully reached.<br/><br/>Many people may not be able to tell the main theme of the movie at first glance, which may be the reason that it is not favorable to many. The film has a greater message than it displays on its surface. The main message of the film is that ideas cannot die. Although V died in the end, his ideas will live on because as long as there is a valid cause, people will stand behind it.<br/><br/>McTeigue made his opinions on his government preference a little too obvious which is a major issue of the overall film. Typically your political opinions should remain to yourself and you should not try to persuade others. The movie also may have over exaggerated how oblivious the citizens would be to the corrupt government, because it seems a bit strange that V would be the first person to think about revolting against the government. I think the main issue that the movie may cause would be people deciding how to handle the issue they want to change. The film shows that they need to use force and violence to get what they want, but that is not always the case and in some situations it causes the issue to worsen.<br/><br/>The ending of the film shows characters that were originally dead, as alive when they watch the destruction of Parliament. Prior to this event, V states, ""Behind this mask, there is more than flesh. Behind this mask, there is an idea Mr. Creedy. And ideas are bulletproof"". The meaning behind this statement is that all of those people died for the cause but their sacrifices did not go unnoticed or unappreciated. Their deaths contributed to the change that occurred and it would not have been possible if they didn't die for what they believed in.<br/><br/>Evey did an excellent job at expressing her emotions throughout the film. Although the mask that V was wearing did not change expressions, the actors tone of voice and body language made his expressions very clear.<br/><br/>I think the message that McTeigue is trying to get across is valid because it shows that people can make a difference and they do not need to settle if they believe in something else. I am confident that the movie sends the right message to people that maybe be afraid to make a change because it shows that they will not be alone in fighting for what they believe in.<br/><br/>McTeigue achieved his goal by illustrating the corruption of the government. The film shows that it only takes one person to make a change and others will stand up for it if the cause is worth changing. Since the film is set in the future, it shows that we may not be far from a similar world. It causes us to be cautious of how much control the government possess before we have little to no control over our own lives. I personally feel like McTeigue explained the issue very well and showed that it would not take much to end up in the same place as them, which makes the film a dystopian cautionary tale.<br/><br/>This film was one of the most interesting dystopian films that I have watched. The film brought light to a controversial topic, the amount of control the government should be allowed to have. The sole purpose of the movie is to make you aware of how bad things can turn out if we let the government take our rights and not fight for what we believe in. McTeigue also depicts that you can make a difference and that you should not depend on other people to stand up for you. The movie shows that if you decide to stand up for your rights, others will follow and your goal is possible to achieve."

","""V For Vendetta"" is a 2005 comic book drama directed by James McTeigue starring Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. As it is sort of a holiday for cinephiles and most of us tend to rewatch it on that particular date, I tried to give it a first time watch myself this year, but unfortunately I had to postpone it due to a punk concert I've visited instead, but now - a few days later - coincidentally on a date that bears a tremendous political importance in Germany, I finally got to see it. So I think this will make it up to it. First of all, this film shows us a dystopian society that has a lot in common with several classic novels. Unfortunately though, there's not enough to it that makes it distinct, it's not as well elaborated as I hoped it would be. There's no explanation of why it happened and doesn't offer any chance to learn about the circumstances. But that's only a minor flaw. What I think was excellently done is the dialogue and the meaning behind every single line. It's so tremendously intelligent and thought provoking and the choice of words is only superb. It effects the viewer to intensively think about the own society one lives in. Furthermore, it's alarming to see how the corrupt government misuses the media for their own, misleading interests and how it is close to it's real-life counterpart at times. It's actually sad to say that the reality doesn't always differ from what is depicted in here. Next to this, the sensational cast really shows that it has top-class actors and actresses in its ranks, especially Portman and Weaving (is it even him, though? Serious question) and it's stylishly filmed and captured the essence of the graphic novel very well. It doesn't recoil to tackle highly inconvenient topics, such as propaganda, mistreatment of human beings and media and the abuse of power. Also, it offers a lot of highly quotable exclamations, but there's still one big issue that prevents it from being a masterpiece: The narrative structure. The film is way to long in general and it has too many scenes that should have been either cut or shortened, but as they are still in the final cut, they perturb the storytelling tremendously. The absolutely well worded scenes and following actions would have had way more impact and would have striked the chord way more unpleasantly if it didn't have so many lengths in it. The buildup of tension was immensely disrupted my multiple scenes that simply lasted to long and, as harsh as it sound, made the tension vanish on several occasions. Each time it seemed to reach the perfect level again, it failed to do so. After seeing this happen a few time it was frustrating. The final act though redeemed the overall unbalanced second act and showed the brilliance it had in the first act. Additionally, it didn't reach the emotional depth I was hoping to see, but that's just mentioned casually. All in all, this dystopian drama knows what it stands for and offers the right approaches, appropriate performances and twists and extremely intelligent lines, besides the disastrous storytelling it's an enjoyable and important flick that makes us reflect our own view to our own society. It's no masterpiece and it's such a pity that it had so much potential to be one."

It is not just a cool comic book adaptation, but a film that draws parallels to real life political situations in some parts of the world. V has almost superpowers, yet he keeps a low profile in his cave, and is polite and modest. It is remarkable how he can bring people together and change something that seems unchangeable. I like the fact that V's identity and origins remain a puzzle, as it enhances suspense and thrill."

","I have always thoroughly enjoyed this movie for it's unique story. My favourite part of the movie would have to be the the power struggle between Peter Creedy and Adam Sutler. We are led to believe that Adam Sutler is, and has always been, the one with the most power. Yet during the course of the movie, Mr Creedy's past deeds and his zealotry push aside Adam Sutler as the main antagonist and allow Mr Creedy to take the spotlight as the main antagonist. Additionally, Chief Inspector Finch's struggle between finding out about the truth about the St Mary's virus and his loyalty to the Norsefire party is very intriguing and engaging. I love this movie, and it will always hold a special place in my heart.<br/><br/>Remember, remember, the Fifth of November."

A lot of, at one time, interesting questions are left unanswered (for example, what's up with the exact same way that V and another character prepare breakfast, which Natalie Portman explicitly notices).<br/><br/>One can see that this worked much better as a graphic novel and that more adaption was needed for a movie.<br/><br/>So, there is a lot worth seeing in this movie, but, at the end you're left with a big question ""couldn't have this been done at least a little better / more even"" in your mind?"

","V for Vendetta is a truly incredible movie experience in and out of the theater. The cinematography and editing was amazingly well-done, and the CGI shots were seamlessly incorporated into the live action.<br/><br/>The Wachowski Brothers (Makers of the Matrix Trilogy) redeem themselves of the flaws from the second and third Matrix movies in V for Vendetta. This, like the original Matrix movie, is one that truly makes you think. However it does more, and blatantly (but tactfully) points out what can happen when people remain silent and passive under a growingly tyrannical government.<br/><br/>The acting is solid all the way through, and even though not all the characters you seen on screen are named, each one is vital to the very plot. The movie has only minor slip-ups in continuity, mostly the appearance of items characters are using. Nothing near important enough to really be concerned about, but some may notice a few things here and there.<br/><br/>A truly amazing movie, balanced enough to make it's point, and not truly point fingers at any one person that they might be basing the characters on."
"ps42","9","2","3","29 August 2006"," Amazing Achievement for McTiegue and crew.
","What a debut showing for director James McTiegue. V for Vendetta is a gem among the deluge of crappy movies we've been hit with this year. Its easily the best action movie of the year. McTiegue takes his experience working on the Matrix, combines it with the eclectic genius of the Wachowski brothers and craft one of the of the deepest and most profound films I've seen in a good while.<br/><br/>The plot follows a revolutionary known only as V and a young woman named Evey in a futuristic, totalitarian Great Britain. The government imposes strict restrictions and on their citizens, including a curfew. Evey and V meet when Evey is out after curfew and is stopped by undercover police. They intend to punish her by raping her, but V, who wears black and a mask in the likeness of Guy Fawkes as a symbol of his intentions, stops them. V is not quite a superhero, but is indeed something special. He is cunning, well educated and devious. Evey, on the other hand is young and impressionable. Circumstances land Evey in the care of V, and the bulk of the plot revolves around V's effort to reform both Evey and the country which he calls home.<br/><br/>V For Vendetta tackles some of the most controversial issues head on. It doesn't shy away from any topic. It attacks not only government issues, but terrorism, homosexuality and a host of others as well. One of the unique things is that it is really up to the viewer to decide what to think about V. Is he a terrorist or a freedom fighter? Are his methods noble and justified or not. Who is the real terrorist? The Chancellor or V? You get an impression on what the film wants you to think, but there is a certain amount of ambiguity involved.<br/><br/>Overall, V for Vendetta exceeded my already high expectations. It took a quality graphic novel and adapted it perfectly for the screen. A real masterpiece for fans of the genre has been given to us. V is a must see."
"rickmeister","9","2","3","29 August 2006"," V for Very Good
","Having just read the comic book I really can't see what writer Alan Moore had to complain about ... the film pretty much updates the plot line from the late-eighties Post-Apocalyptic paranoia to today's fear of a terrorist biological weapon attack. The roots of the story, a Britain in the grip of a right-wing totalitarian state and the unquenchable idea of personal freedom however, remain the same.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving as the eponymous V is quite mesmerising and does a great job of delivering some of the often quite flowery language. Natalie Portman is equally watchable as Evey Hammond who is inadvertently on the run from the forces of the totalitarian state authorities. Obviously she's nice to look at too, but she does strike a good balance between hardy heroine and vulnerable victim.<br/><br/>John Hurt is also well-cast as Sutler - the figurehead of the state - but you can't help thinking that it's a bit too close to Big Brother (the film not the ongoing reality TV nightmare!) and since Hurt acted opposite Burton in the 1984 epic I found it a bit difficult to disassociate the two. There are also some good supporting cameos from Stephen Fry and Rupert Graves.<br/><br/>All in all though it's film that makes you think, whether it will date if and when terrorist threats become a thing of the past I don't know, but in today's political climate of fear, intolerance and prejudice it is all to easy to imagine that even the generally liberal British are only one major attack away from sanctioning some draconian governmental policies. Let's face it ID cards are coming in soon to the UK and that is seen by many as the start of some real Big Brother attention."
"scrotumblender","8","2","3","29 May 2006"," Good movie with decent acting
","At first I hesitated to go see this movie. I was wrong... V for Vendetta is a good political action movie that takes over 2 hours and doesn't get boring at all.<br/><br/>In the not too distant future the whole powersystem in the world has fallen apart, but in this movie they stick with the story of England. After the world terrorism as we know today had increased to abnormal proportions the government of England had decided to take more control over the people. England has become a totalitarian state in which the government rules the people's life (camera's everywhere, subway shut-down). One individual wearing a mask has a plan to fight the power. The story begins quite fast as the 'terrorist' saves a young female from a couple of corrupt police-agents and then takes her to a roof-top to let her see what his big plan is. After blowing up the courthouse he's tapped in to the government controlled television-network and appeals to all people in England to fight the power exactly one year after his television message, November the 5th.<br/><br/>Naturally the dictator of England is in panic and wants the terrorist brought to trial by any means. Slowly the people begin to question the government and more and more people become sympethatic to the terorist' cause although the government tries to put him in a bad daylight with TV-propaganda. So far for the storyline, you'll have to see the rest of it yourself.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be a very realistic scenario although the name of the movie sounds a little bit cartoony. It's about a modern fascist state and how it became that way. It has great similarities with the upcoming of Hitler in 1933. People live in fear and are willing to sacrifice freedom for safety. Governemnt propaganda is everywhere just like in 1940's Germany although the reason for becoming a fascist state has been put in a modern jacket. Even the clothing of state police looks simular to SS-uniforms and they also performed gruesome medical experiments on political deserters (wich play a keyroll in the story later on)just like the German doctor Joseph Mängele.<br/><br/>So to sum it all up: A very realistic and ingenious story with decent actors. The conversations can be a bit philosophical especially in the beginning but when the plot thickens the movie seems to last merely an hour, because it is so interesting to watch. Special effects are okay. The ending could've been better though. I got the feeling that the director ran out of time or something but the movie lasts a good 130 minutes.<br/><br/>One to watch definitely"
"jon2005","8","2","3","22 May 2006"," V for Vendetta
","Based on Alan Moore's excellent graphic novel, V for Vendetta is set in a post-nuclear world, where Britain is run by a fascist government which sets limitations upon the freedom of it's peoples in true Nineteen Eighty Four style. A man named V (Hugo Weaving), uses terrorist tactics to try to show the people of Britain how they have fallen into passive acceptance of this regime, starting by destroying the Old Bailey, then publicly announcing that in exactly one year he will destroy the Houses of Parliament. Along the way he meets Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman who he believes can help him achieve his goals.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta has turned up at an interesting time. Indeed, with the news mostly concerned with terrorists and dubious politics, it seems apt that a supposed blockbuster film should come along and try to get us to think about exactly what the hell is going on with our world. People have associated the film with Iraq, North Korea, and Nazi Germany, despite the fact that it was written during Margaret Thatcher's time as Prime Minister. Alan Moore himself has disassociated himself with the film because he believes it has been twisted from its original intentions, but it seems right to do this  if people are going to get a message across, it needs to be relevant to the day and age that the message is concerned with.<br/><br/>The real focus is V  is he a terrorist or a freedom fighter? It depends on the perspective taken. From Adam Sutler's (John Hurt) government's view, he is a terrorist, but he soon opens peoples' eyes to become their freedom fighter. But the methods he uses are dubious  destroying famous landmarks, packing an underground train with explosives (particularly relevant for Britain now) and strapping explosives to himself. This is clearly a film that wants us to think.<br/><br/>And it does. In fact, audiences have been deceived by trailers that show V for Vendetta to be an action film. In reality, there are less than ten minutes of action throughout its two hour run time, but this doesn't matter as the rest of the film has been carefully structured to keep the audience interested without the need for slo-mo violence. The key to its appeal is the characters, and here the actors all stand out. Natalie Portman is the right kind of actress to portray Evey (although her English accent suffers, sometimes horrifically, but it is a reasonable attempt), and shows her vulnerabilities very well. Stephen Rea's detective is a world-weary man, frustrated by V's ability to avoid capture, again carried off with aplomb. The star is of course Hugo Weaving as V who, being masked all the way through the film (he never reveals his face, emphasizing his existence as an idea rather than a person), has to rely on physical and vocal actions to portray emotion, which he does extremely capably. His voice is perfect for V  understanding and passionate, yet with a slight hint of craziness.<br/><br/>There are some faults  Britain loses the grimy feel that was given to us in the graphic novel, instead looking plain and perhaps too much like today's London. Secondly, sometimes the film feels too heavy handed in its message, coming across as clumsily preachy. Also, V's introduction is, from the script's point of view, extremely heavy handed and could potentially put viewers off the film. Stick with it though, and underneath the blockbuster you'll find a film that is both daring us to challenge our way of thinking, and also managing to entertain.<br/><br/>Rated: 8/10 <br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"

","Where do I begin? ""V for Vendetta"" is a fun movie, with an annoying aftertaste that gets more pronounced as you leave the theater and begin the walk home.<br/><br/>I never read the book. I don't believe that a movie must stick to the dogma of the book that was its inspiration. It's a movie, with liabilities and assets that don't necessarily work in both mediums.<br/><br/>It should be noted that as a right-of-center libertarian type who believes that the United States is the last hope for maintaining liberty in the world, I view things from a particular perspective.<br/><br/>I like the concept of fighting for freedom in a repressive society. I'm not against the concept of using violence to overthrow tyranny. I don't mind borrowing themes from different movies and books. And I think that Natalie Portman is maturing into a decent actress. I don't even mind the occasional cliché, even if it pokes fun at my wonderful United States.<br/><br/>But you know... you can't base a movie on clichés and political correctness. And that is exactly what the core theme of this movie is all about.<br/><br/>I don't believe what I'm about to say involves spoilers and apologize if it inadvertently does, but in this flick, the villains are Christian males of European extraction, hereafter referred to as ""Pale Faces."" The film takes place in England. The United States is a warmongering trouble maker who has screwed up the world and the British Torries are a bunch of authoritarian tyrants who have turned Great Britan into a police state.<br/><br/>In England everyone is a ""Pale Face,"" because they have expelled or killed everyone else. Naturally, the expelled Arab Moslems, West Indians and Africans were total innocents. They were in no way responsible for the violence, drug dealing and terrorism that apparently made the ""Pale Face"" majority kick out the Labor Party and vote for Torry fascists. And the British Labor Party (renoun for passing anti-free speech legislation and firearms confiscation laws) has passed from the scene.<br/><br/>But wait folks, because it doesn't end here. Homosexual ""Pale Faces"" have been forced back into the closet and the Koran has been banned because it is a tremendously beautiful and profound work of art. Naturally, nothing is mentioned of the Bible where the Book of Psalms is generally considered to be one of the best done prose ever written. That goes well with the rapist pedophile Christian clergy that support the tyranny and are even in it's government.<br/><br/>After all, we know that Moslem clerics are universally peaceful, never condone violence, believe in free speech, religious freedom, strenuously object to honor rapes and slowly sawing infidel's heads off like turkey legs.<br/><br/>The only thing omitted to make this skewed scenario complete would be to have a few Jewish Doctors harvesting the organs of illegal aliens for sale in Tel Aviv. But I guess that would be too much, even for the Worchowski brothers to capitalize on. And by the way, I'm a practitioner of the Jewish faith and a military officer, so get over it.<br/><br/>What a world! What a world! This is definitely not Kansas anymore.<br/><br/>Up from the ashes comes a ""Pale Face"" hero in a mask. But wait a minute. He's not really a ""Pale Face,"" because diabolical genetic engineering has morphed him into a scarred and mangled ""any man"" (or ""any person"" if you wish).<br/><br/>Natalie Portman gets her head shaved, truth and justice reigns and it can be assumed that ethnic drug dealers, terrorists and illegal aliens are invited back into England to restore civilization under a Socialist Labor government.<br/><br/>Somebody give me a break."

They would have told you that not terrorist acts brought down these systems.

We are a hair's breadth away from the kind of scenario portrayed: Mysterious experimental virus's being unleashed on unsuspecting civilians; paralyzing fear fueled by fake news media; people being pressured and shamed into wearing masks and keeping apart from each other; vaccinations now being tested on people who have no idea what is in it with the threat of becoming mandatory; freedom of speech slowly being stifled through the guise of 'political correctness'; the government slowly nut surely taking more and more control of people and their lives. Slowly, slowly catch your monkey...and although other countries are in revolt, the UK remains as a nation of 'do as you're told' citizens. When I first watched this in 2005 I thought it was a chilling prophecy of what soon might come to pass. Now it's fast becoming a reality. That said, I love all the Wachowski movies and believe they must be some sort of time travelers given the content of many of their movies. Therefore I give this one 10/10"

","The movie should have been renamed j for jihad. The amount of Muslim references in the movie was absurd. If you didn't notice them, Ill give a few references. First was the evil government's symbol was a cross. The man who Natalie portman stayed with was killed because they found a koran in his house. The people who were put in the camps were in the same orange outfits and had black bags on their head, similar to the terrorist prisoner camps. The list goes on and on. I really got the feeling the movie was justifying terrorist attacks against the U.S. and criticizing the current government. People who think this movie was great seriously need to get their heads checked. It sad that crap like this is released and seen as a masterpiece."

","The message it is sending is terrifying. Near the end one of the main characters says that "" people need a symbol more than they need a building"" before blowing up the House of Commons. This sounds way too much like Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber who was responsible for the death of so many innocent people. There is a lot of anti-war commentary referring to ""Americas War"" in Iraq and of course the villains are the religious right. <br/><br/>I am afraid there are going to be a number of Guy Fawkes wanna be's who think that by killing people and blowing up buildings that they are striking a blow for freedom. In reality is all we will get is the Patriot Act Two. <br/><br/>If it weren't for all of the above I will say it was an entertaining movie. And I would rate it a six.

But it turned out to be a low-budget movie which pretends to be a ""big movie"".The only message the movie brought over correctly was when Natalie Portman told ""V"" she met an old friend of hers who did not recognize her, and then she added ""Whatever you have done to me, it worked ""...and for the action-lovers ; even the sequels to ""The Matrix"" where better...I can imagine however, one doesn't know the french revolution by heart, never heard of George Orwell, or philosophers like John Lock, Voltaire or Rousseau, or even, philosophy itself.

","That is the most boring movie I have seen in ages! I couldn't believe somebody actually liked this movie. Each episode seems like it has no relation with the previous episode, which basically means you can start the movie from any place and still understand it all. Awful plot. All time along I had no interest in what's going to happen next. Zero action. There was only that blah blah blah and nothing else.Directing sucks. You know, sometimes you watch the movie and you even say ""nice directing"" because the director tried and made the viewing of the movie alone - interesting. That surely was not the case with VfV. All he did was switch from cam A to cam B. You know, it's like in photographing business, there's that golden section rule. If a photo is made by following this rule, then even a simple photo will look attractive, and the magic is that golden section. In movies, there has to be some other magic, and some directors use it, and some DON'T, like the director of ""V for Vendetta""! And OMG how I regret I spend my time on it. Don't believe the 8+ rating, it's not worth even a round 5!! I gave it a well-deserved and earned 1 (one). I felt with my guts that this would be a crap movie, and it really was. Sorry but it's plain truth."
"deakint","7","14","44","8 March 2006"," V is for ""V""ery political and still ""V""ery stylish
","This movie seems to tear me in two. On one side, it was well done and well implemented from my perspective, though I have never read the comic therefore digressing on it's true implementation is beyond my scope. On the other hand, this movie is almost too much to stomach, unless one is a true conspiracy theorist. My entire post-screening group interview was filled with people discussing how closely linked the government in ""Vendetta"" was to America's own. This could in no way be the case, though the crazies are always around.<br/><br/>While I would say that the audience reaction does not damage the film, I will also say I saw blatant motive for feeling the movie was a political message to support these theories. While I found the abundance of this message weighed the film down, it also carried with it a very film-noir/Victorian-esquire feeling. There are goodperformances and some good action (though it was well done). All in all, very stylish, but it tried a bit hard and hurt itself at the same time. 6/10 overall, but worth a watch for fun."
"ansac111","1","6","15","24 November 2011"," Over-hyped and oversimplified !
","I have to admit that I was pretty excited to see V for Vendetta. One of my good friends highly recommended it and he is usually right in these matters but to his discredit this time he was way off. ""V for Vendetta"" is tedious, boring and ill conceived. It's hard to point out exactly where it goes wrong, because there are so many things wrong with it that it's impossible to lay the blame in one area.<br/><br/>Movie is a political look at perils of conservative government through leftwing looney glasses. The structure of the movie is strange it really cannot decide whether to give more power to moderate character like Finch, these attempts are thwarted (which is a shame). Secondly, it gets awfully tedious looking at V and his stupid mask for 10 minutes, let alone over 2 hours. The film also lacks emotion and depth; I couldn't care less about any of the characters. The script isn't so great either. There's a 20 minute long digression into the story of a lesbian that I didn't get. It also (in not so subtle way) glorifies terrorism; In fact the actress in the movie even says that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter. Maybe in this actress's leftwing world one can't tell the difference, but to an intelligent man there is a difference between George Washington (or Bhagat Singh) and Osama Bin Laden.<br/><br/>In short this over-hyped and over-simplified movie just bored me to death. I am glad I was on a movie marathon and watched ""There is something about Marry"" earlier in the day (way better than V) which kept me in a good mood!"

","Not a terrible movie, but not very good either. <br/><br/>It is the typical liberal program film where the government is evil, homosexuals are put on a pedestal, and religion is evil. The biggest problem with the film is not this one-dimensional approach, but rather that it conveys a feeling of moral superiority because it takes on these ""deep"" issues.<br/><br/>If you have a couple hours to burn, there are worse movies to watch, but I wish I hadn't wasted my time. It simply takes itself much too seriously. The only way I would recommend this film is if you are a big fan of someone in the film."
"Pooka_fn0rd","2","6","15","19 March 2006"," Little Style, No Substance
","I went to this film with little in the way of expectation; having been witness to the spiritless abortions that came of previous Alan Moore adaptations, I could hardly walk into the theatre expecting a cinematic masterpiece, could I? My pessimism was not unwarranted. This film was a soulless abomination in nearly every sense of the word. The severity of my feelings may have something to do with my fondness for the original work in all honesty, but I also genuinely feel as if this film is ultimately insulting to the audience in a way that I found deeply depressing - where once we had a story of personal responsibility, the film takes that responsibility away from the characters (and thus, the audience) and perhaps that has something to do with the medium; The comic engages and encourages the reader to think for themselves, the movie is spoon-fed rebellion for the people of today that just can't be bothered to think for themselves.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the only scene in this film that has anything resembling a genuine emotional impact is the one about Valerie, and I don't think it's a coincidence that it's the only scene largely untouched compared to the original material. More shame, because that simply serves to highlight what a wonderful film this could have been, had they only stuck to the source material.<br/><br/>Stop rewriting Alan Moore, people."

","This movie was ridiculously horrid. Besides the fact that absolutely everyone in the movie is a homosexual, there is too, too, too much talking. I almost fell asleep trying to keep up with this atrocious plot. The ending seemed totally pointless and anticlimactic. Where is the action so often associated with the Wachowski Brothers? I mean, I'm an intelligent person, but I'm still only fourteen. This tremendous lack of action left my friends and I angry that we wasted our money on such crap. Not only the action, but the plot was lacking as well. There was no real resolution in the end of the film, specifically when the audience is never told who ""V"" really is, and how he became such a skilled ""terrorist"". And the entire movie seems like a waste when all of the talking and exposition of the setting leads just to the destruction of one building, with no one in it, might I add. The movie did not even tell what significance this event had on anything. This movie was a complete waste of time."

One of the biggest problems I had with this was how the kidnapping and torture of Evey was a set up by V to show her ""what it was like to really be free"". This is not the first time that I've seen something like this and it just seemed stupid to me and a half thought out explanation. <br/><br/>Aside from that, I didn't really find all that much wrong with this film, but it just didn't hold my attention and it was not as good as I though it should have been.

","X-Men + 1942 + 911 + Hollywood, in a blender. A puke-fest of misplaced social commentary and hypocritical mixed messages. Pretentious political propaganda hidden behind a mask of all-American dissent. Utterly far-fetched, and disgustingly over dramatized.<br/><br/>I can perhaps see what the writer/director may have been trying to accomplish, but clearly they were visionaries without any sense of tact. England falling under Natzi-Germany-like rule, running concentration-like camps, suddenly transformed into a society without a trace of humanity, is simply not believable except in the context of satire and film noir. But this film tried to be a epic drama. The story's hero, the superhuman masked man whose dialauge was a eloquent riddle of literary exerps, was indeed an entertaining character. We love this hero, despite the fact that he is a terrorist. So is terrorism justified then if your cause is freedom?<br/><br/>All in all, its apparently what the average American audience wants."

However, almost all other movies based on comics are more or less crap, especially Sin City (I rated it 3/10), and now- V for Vendeta. At some point at the start it seemed to be a movie for children, considering childish (at best) humor, but then came the terror, and blood, so I was asking myself, is this a movie for some new kind of children? Because I will not believe the jokes are good/acceptable for anyone with IQ above 50. Then, there is political theme. Have to say, I don't mind if comics heroes fight gremlins, or other green/yellow/whatever monsters, but to make any references to actual places, or real politics is a disaster. What you see, is stupid. OK let M.Moore do that, he is already bad enough, but please, no comics..

Also, Natalie Portman should not be allowed to make movies. She's one of the worst actresses of all time.

"fluturoj","5","4","9","16 April 2017"," Old story. Government gone evil and a hero that wants to save the nation from ti-just that the hero is not heroic but rather vindictive.
","Real life lessons: I know this is supposed to be profound and make you reflect on life quite a lot but I must say I did not encounter a moment in this movie that made me think "" I better remember that'. <br/><br/>Plausibility: Weakish. The idea that a biologically created monster seeks revenge is OK and that the government created a virus to tyronise its nation but how come a single person with a mask on a TV convinces all those people to go to parliament square and face their death in attempt to change something. Can that be done is a year? By a person who no one knows who he is? Would a father and a mother risk the safety of their family just because a masked man on telly tells them to do so? Don't really think so. What safes the movie a bit is the scene when a finger men kills a child for wearing the mask. That is something that would make a nation revolt if it is already poked. So a medium plausibility here. <br/><br/>Villain: The government, a dictator. This could have been strange and the supreme chancellor appearing only on a screen makes him seem as powerful, unreachable. But he is easily beaten when his security betrays him and brings him to V and that is the worse way to totally weaken the villain in a movie. If your villain is strong it should not be beaten so easily. <br/><br/>Storytelling: Starts well. Tells the story of Evey first then that of Vendetta. Then moves to the story beyond them that concerns them all and the common villain that needs to be beaten and this all occurs within one year which is clearly stated in the beginning of the movie. Two problems with this movie: they mention that all the events in the movie connect but I did not see that happening. And second, you know that the big event is going to happen on the 5th of November 1 year from the first year in the movie. It starts amazing with interesting scene when the old baily is blown up but the ending was not good, you would expect exactly that ending. Envey falling in love with V is expected but makes no sense, they never had a connection. <br/><br/>Character development: the stronger development here is without no doubt that of Envey. She beats her fear and takes leadership at the end. Vendetta seeks revenge and never do you see him reflecting if he is indeed doing the right thing. I mean killing people like the doctor at the end even though she confess she had no idea what was going on. She said 'I hoped to change the world; and he replies 'I have not come here for what you hoped to do but for what you did' That my friend is monstrous and has no regards of others feelings and motives. Stop and think V for once, stop and think. <br/><br/>Acting/Casting: I can only say one thing here-Natalie Portman is brilliant. <br/><br/>Overall, it is an old story. Government gone evil and a hero that wants to save the nation from ti- just that the hero is not heroic but rather vindictive."

The fact that he had to do it all behind a mask makes it doubly impressive. He has a great, expressive voice, and he makes full use of it here. He is able to be engagingly delightful one minute, then become terrifyingly intimidating the next. Natalie Portman is a good actress and a beautiful woman, but she's too petite for a movie like this. I feel like a stronger actress would have been better (both physically and emotionally).<br/><br/>The story is not very original, which ties into my biggest complaint with the movie. Instead of being a new take on an old idea, V For Vendetta's story feels more like a political statement than entertainment. I understand and even admire the writers for taking such a strong stance on their politics, but I feel like the story is riding on top of the political statement.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, I like this movie.

A totalitarian state in which you actually feel anger and fear towards instead of abject apathy.

","Let's put aside the obvious artistic achievements of this movie, thoroughly described in other comments, and look at the political side of it. Perhaps in other times, 5-10 years ago, this side would be not of any importance. Today however, when it's obvious that fascism is quickly gaining momentum in the U.S., followed by other countries like UK, this movie has too many parallels to the reality that can't be ignored. Looking from this angle, the movie plays very negative role, and its message plays for the evil party. It's actually 100% American way: people living under fascistic regime don't really need to do anything. Someone will promptly come over to the rescue, and he will crash the regime using few karate kicks and few explosions. No need to unite, no need to organize, to struggle, no need for revolutionary media, or any other effort or risk. In the right time, everyone will be given a mask to conveniently hide the identity, in case things go wrong; then, somehow, everyone will be on the street, without any visible organizational effort; then couple of explosions, and the regime will crash. Nice and easy solution without any real effort, so we can continue enjoying reality shows on the tube, while our troops kill Iraqis by thousands in our name and on our money.

"r0cko723","3","4","9","15 August 2006"," Mister Anderson . . . you disappoint me.
","In his review of this overblown and disappointing shovel-ful of lard-hype (I say disappointing, because the writer/producers' ""The Matrix"" was wonderfully inventive and character-driven), my man Roger Ebert asks: ""Is this movie a parable about 2006, a cautionary tale or a pure fantasy?"" PUHLEEEEEASE. C'mon, man. I mean, how overt does a roll of celluloid have to be before you give it the sledgehammer award for heavy-handedness? For me, this film was a huge disappointment because my expectations were so high, based on how much I enjoyed ""The Matrix"" and ""Bound,"" both written and directed by the Brothers W, who screen-scripted ""V"" and evidently left their second man James McTeigue hanging out to dry as director on this one. There was nothing subtle about the contrived and preachy analogies between the totalitarian bad guys in ""V"" and the targeted real-world counterparts and conservative ideologies in the West. The problem with the politically motivated axe-grinding that shows up in films like ""V"" is that any efforts to produce a more encompassing, honest, and human depiction of characters and events are subsumed to the desire to propagandize and preach. With the passage of time, a film like ""V"" becomes more trite and embarrassing, while a film like ""The Matrix"" becomes more established and entrenched in our hearts and minds. Artists who eschew that which is most universal and central to the human condition in order to rail against personalities/parties/fill-in-the-blank of the ephemeral and always shifting political landscape give away so very much to preach points that are already tiring and lame by the time they hit the screen. I will always love the Wachowski Bros' best works, but this one isn't worth the time it takes to view it."
"skymovies","2","4","9","13 April 2006"," Vacuous vehicle for a verbose vigilante
","V is indeed for vendetta. But it's also for Vespa, an under-powered vehicle with a monotonous drone that takes forever to get to its final destination. How apt.<br/><br/>Verily, the vessel of vigilantism with the vinyl-veneered visage is a verbal virtuoso who vindicates violence and vexes villains (and viewers) with vacuous values and vows of vengeance whilst voiding his victims with venom. And being such a valiant vouch-saviour of veracity, V's vile and vindictive behaviour is validated.<br/><br/>Ergo, any vociferous vituperation must be vented at the vendors of this vapid and verbose venture because V For Vendetta is a virtual vacuum of vigour, vitality or verve. Or, to borrow the script's most over-used word: ""Boll**ks"".<br/><br/>It's difficult to get behind an effete bore with no face and a Swing Out Sister wig who loves only one thing more than blowing things up: the sound of his own voice. Just when you'd put the bloated cod-philosophical ruminations of the The Matrix Reloaded's Architect from your mind, the Wachowski brothers have effectively given him his own movie.<br/><br/>""Who? Who is but the form following the function of what."" Well thank you, Dr Seuss.<br/><br/>It drones on and on (and on) about freedom of thought and non-conformity before dressing everyone up to look exactly like V in a final scene that would have been deemed too cheesy for an 80s rock video.<br/><br/>And how many times do we have to watch a human kebab emerging from flaming ruins?<br/><br/>Vendetta creator Alan Moore knew what he was doing when he washed his hands of this debacle. Pity Natalie Portman didn't do the same thing. She's dreadful  even if you ignore the accent stuck between Dartford and Durban.<br/><br/>""I wish I didn't have to be here tonight"" says one character. He took the words right out of my mouth."
"davidsclement","4","4","9","23 March 2006"," It's the fear, man!
","The moment I physically shook my head during this movie came when V (and this is a spoiler) revealed that he had tricked the girl into thinking she was going to be executed. Gotcha! It was only a test. And now you can live without fear. Awesome, thanks man. As far as I understood it, that kind of mental torture usually turned people into haunted shells of their former selves. But who knows, maybe what we all need is mock execution therapy... <br/><br/>Other than that, I actually liked the pace and the visual experience. I also liked that the movie caricatured the use of anti-terrorist rhetoric to manipulate the public -- an important enough point these days that I actually didn't mind having it shoved down my throat in this case. I just wonder if there aren't some teenagers (or equivalents) out there who might think that the Wachowski Brothers are commanding them to blow up the White House. <br/><br/>All in all, I think the Wachowskis, like M Night Shyamalan, impress w/ certain trademark virtues, but ultimately disappoint by taking themselves too seriously and being transparently shallow when they appear to think they are waxing deep -- taking us to different kinds of depths than they intend."

","I can't believe people on this site are talking about the same movie as I saw today.<br/><br/>It was unatmospheric, poorly acted and without any emotional impact - and contained precious little in the way of original thought.<br/><br/>Also, if you are going to depict the downfall of a totalitarian regime, at least show us the status quo properly before it is taken apart. Families sitting at home giggling in front of the TV is hardly the stuff of Orwell, is it?<br/><br/>I haven't read the graphic novel though I normally like Alan Moore's work. I can only assume the baleful influence of the Wachowski Brothers smothered Moore's original vision. Much like the second and third Matrix films, this film drowned in its own self-importance and cod philosophy. A film made by pseuds for pseuds to marvel at.<br/><br/>I gave it two out of ten for Stephen Fry and the destruction of the Houses of Parliament alone.<br/><br/>Dreadful."

","First things first. This movie uses a radical, prejudice and hateful government as the enemy and that is fine. But making it out to be a symbol for the UK and US is silly and the film makers did this.<br/><br/>OK, this movie was based on a Graphic Novel that is strongly pro-Anarchy. The movie, however, was just an anti American/Britan politics movie. It attacked the Conservative party only. The movie has a line that goes something like ""Art uses lies to tell the truth while politician use lies to hide the truth. This movie was just as much politics as art and the film makers politicians as they where artist. So are they the liars to hide the truth or to tell the truth. I'd have to say they're lying to hide the truth. The truth being that this movie was just a childish exaggeration of the right. True art isn't Political. You can attack individual views but when you attack an entire Political party it's just politics, and it looses it's beauty as art.<br/><br/>I saw this bumper sticker once that read ""Doing my part to pis* off the religious right."" I think the Wachowski brothers read this sticker and decided to make this movie. That is how simple minded this film was.<br/><br/>Although this movie is a steaming pile of hypocrisy that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It had good action and some good dialog. Natalie Portman can't act. Why do people keep giving her jobs. I loved Hugo Weaving as V his voice acting and body movements made me forget about the mask.<br/><br/>I am disappointed in the adaptation from the book to screen. This movie took an Idea and made it a cheap attack on the right. The book is about anarchy people. What the heck.<br/><br/>If you hate the right than this movie is made for you. You can sit there and agree with everything they say, even if it's wrong, and remain unenlightened to the truth."

","V for Very good.<br/><br/>I remember finding the V for Vendetta graphic novel at a townhouse I was renting and reading it and thinking it was amazing. Used to comics being Superman and Aquaman it was so different, so many levels. Hard to follow at times but excellent. That was about 12 years ago so I'd forgotten about. Until the movie came along and it was truly great. <br/><br/>The Wachowski Bros have done it again. Great futuristic, Ne-socialist, 1984ish atmosphere. Yes a lot goes towards the fact that if you want to be rid of crime, terrorism and poverty and such then you must give up your individual freedoms and certain rights. Sound familiar? Which is better? I dunno. But it's a great movie that doesn't just preach one side or the other. It shows you both. And the Bill O'Reilly/Ann Coulter type announcer who spews the party line is too funny and just way too familiar. And the way the government controls the media (Fox News) and twists or just plain fabricates stories to make them look good."
"gaz_savage","5","4","9","20 March 2006"," Distinctly Average
","I think that V for Vendetta is over rated I think if it was done by anyone other than the wachowski brothers it wouldn't have even made it to cinema.....The storyline is good its an idea that hasn't been touched on but the execution is what let it down. Agent Smith plays a good part in this film as ""V"" but I don't think is supported by his fellow actors, Natalie Portman should be shot for her ""English Accent"" as most of the time I thought she was either from South Africa or France.... y wasn't keira Knightley used for this part she is exactly the same just English. The film also hung on way ""V"" wanted to get back at the Government they could of explained the whole story in one line... instead we were subjected to lots of boring scenes which led nowhere but to the point we had already heard over and over again.... I think Stephen Fry played a very good part and his acting saved the film slightly....Overall I gave this film 5/10 for the boredom I was forced to sit through"
"joebenaiah","5","4","9","20 March 2006"," Nothing special, read the book
","This isn't the worst movie ever, but don't buy the hype about a message movie. The message is heavy handed and poorly executed (note I am not saying I disagree with it or it is propaganda, it just isn't very good). Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are wonderful, I mean I would watch N.P. eat breakfast and be happy, but certain aspects of their interactions are gut wrenchingly cliché and silly. The plot stresses simplicity and often the audience is informed of things rather than shown them just to make sure no one got lost on the straight as an arrow plot. Unfortunately simplicity does not prevent plot holes and this movie is rife with inconsistencies, omissions, pointless twists, a huge subplot with no resolution and perhaps the most cliché romantic dialogue imaginable. It isn't horrible, it isn't The Day After Tomorrow or Troy (prime examples of terrible blockbusters) but it is standard Hollywood fare and any message presented is done far more compellingly elsewhere no matter what your politics (it borrows a lot of it's ideologies from Bowling for Columbine). Go see the movie if you want some so-so escapist far, but you could get something better off the netflix queue without trying too hard (Brazil springs to mind). If you want to see the story done right, read the book."

","I saw this movie this weekend and was nothing short of amazed.<br/><br/>The actors perform wonderfully, and as if I thought Natalie Portman couldn't get any better, she portrays her character beautifully, and really adds flare to the film.<br/><br/>Many may find reasons to ridicule the political aspects of the film, but what people don't seem to get, is that the movie is not clever use of propaganda, it's simply a well crafted MOVIE. It's a film, it's not real. It uses many main focuses of today's society, but the Chancellor does not represent Bush, and the terrorist V is not out to destroy the world. In a way, he is out to destroy all that he finds evil in the world.<br/><br/>The Wachowski brothers have done it again. Screw The Matrix, V is it.<br/><br/>Okay, that's my two cents.

"das417","6","4","9","20 March 2006"," 'MF' for Mixed Feelings
","After long delays and much hype, Alan Moore's impressive V for Vendetta has been released. Push back due to a main actor dropping out, and a host of other problems, V for Vendetta opened to an eager public wondering if this movie could live up to the standard given it. Also, would it be able to overcome the gossip and rumors that had been spoken of do to the problems with just filming it. Oh, and who can forget that Natalie Portman will have a shaved head? Will wonders never cease!? <br/><br/>I cannot speak for everyone else since a movie like this will bring out different emotions and feelings over the portrayal of a 'terrorist' being a 'hero'. However, after several days of thinking upon V for Vendetta, and reading the graphic novel it is based upon, I have come up with my conclusions.<br/><br/>Vendetta starts off with the brutal attempted assault on Evey (Natalie Portman) at the hand of the 'fingermen' (no pun intended). Government agents who enforce strict curfew laws and do other such draconian laws set up by Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), who would win a Hitler look a like contest any day. When the fingermen are about to harm Evey, in comes a mysterious hero wearing a Guy Fawkes who of course saves Evey while beating up the fingermen.<br/><br/>Evey, obviously taken back by a man who wears a mask, openly beats fingermen, and speaks in such a poetic way, learns that his name V (Hugo Weaving). Following him for a short 'engagement' she is stunned when the Old Bailey is destroyed right before her eyes. All the while V is conducting an 'orchestra' as music fills the streets of London on the very same loud speakers the government uses to inform the public of curfews.<br/><br/>What happens next is a serious of further attacks on the state and those who harmed V in the past, the learning of what V's history is (though we never really know), the attempt of Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea) to discover who V is and stop him while he discovers the truth behind the government and it's past actions, and the sudden transformation of Evey into a timid citizen into a freedom fighter with a shaved head. While this promises much, instead Vendetta fails and slowly comes to an uninteresting conclusion. Too much time is spent trying to portray an totalitarian state while not enough is spent showing how it is deal with. Most of V's actions, few that we see, are somehow supposed to topple a regime within a year. Again, seeing more of these actions and their means would have made this a bit more believable.<br/><br/>Another factor which slowed the movie down in its plot was the 'torture' of Evey. Through a series of brutal interrogations, bad food, a note from a woman who was oppressed before she was, and eventual discover of courage Evey never knew she had, we learn that it was V himself was behind all of this. His attempt of showing that when Evey loses her fear, she gains strength. I understand the meaning behind this and what it was supposed to to do for Evey. However, being placed towards the middle/ending of the movie only caused it to lag. A better placement would have been to have Evey come to these conclusions much earlier without having the story go over much repeated information such as overcoming fear and holding onto freedom.<br/><br/>In the end, V manages to strike a deal with one of Sutler's right-hand men who betrays the dictator to V's sense of justice. Of course, V then turns on this would be replacement and finishes off what we are to guess is the major leadership of the party and government. Parliament is blown up, everyone challenges the government, and freedom is restored even though V does not live to see the day.<br/><br/>A moving story about freedom and oppression? I would have to say no. A plot drawn with not enough substance (Alan Moore might agree since he didn't like the movie) slows what could have been one of the better movies for 2006. It's not a bad movie, far from it. The acting is well done (especially Weaving's ability to speak in such a poetic way and in a convincing manner) as is the action sequences. Again, though, it proves to be nothing special. <br/><br/>6 out of 10"
"jctundis","9","4","9","19 March 2006"," Excellent (with some reservations)
","Well, just returned from seeing the movie... again.<br/><br/>As a movie, all on its own, I liked it. Obviously, having just watched it a 2nd time is as many days:) If you're looking for a direct translation, you're out of luck. Evy is played differently, other characters are amalgamated, sub-plots eliminated, events transpire out of order, etc -- standard comic-to-movie fare. However, even though much of V's dialog is changed, Hugo Weaving brings V to life in brilliant fashion (although the ""movie V"" is less vicious than the ""book V"").<br/><br/>All the core moments of the book are there, and some scenes are taken verbatim (or close to it) right from the printed page. The general feel has been updated, and subject matter as well to make the story more contemporary.<br/><br/>And therein lies my only major complaint. I have no issue with a film maker creating a *new* film, and injecting it with a current, topical nature (as George Lucas did) but I'm disappointed that the Wachowski Bros felt they had to so alter Alan Moore's work. I can totally understand Moore's reaction to the script, and the simplifying for general movie audiences.<br/><br/>If you haven't read the book in years (I re-read it today for the first time I'm MANY years), or not at all, you may want to see the movie first - otherwise, you may be disappointed.

","You know, I honestly didn't know what to expect from this movie. V for Vendetta isn't really the best title ever, and the previews were really vague,... so I was skeptical. Still, it was a great film with amazing actors who brought a futuristic society to life. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman delivered what I would consider to be the best performance of her life. I've never liked Natalie Portman much, but Vendetta kind of woke me up to her talents. She made everything that would normally be intense even MORE real, and it was emotionally draining (in a good way). Besides, anyone who shaves her head for a movie deserves the kudos.<br/><br/>I'll admit the idea of a world in which the government controls every facet of human life is kind unoriginal, but this made it a lot easier to relate to. I like the fact that they mentioned exact dates and years in the movie. At the beginning, it was a little confusing as far as exactly when it was all taking place, but it developed itself.<br/><br/>The character ""V"" was so interesting, too! He was so poetic and lyrical all the time, even when he probably shouldn't have been... It was what made me like him even though he was going around killing technically ""innocent"" people. He's strange like that.<br/><br/>So I guess my point is that it was a thoughtful, interesting, emotional movie with great actors and a hardcore guy in a mask. People looking for a cheap thrill will find more than they bargained for, but snazzy film critics should lay up on the scrutiny (just this once) and give it props. I would."

","In an industry where DC Comics and Marvel pump out comic book based movies almost bi-monthly, I was hesitant to try V out. However, after experiencing this powerful movie, I am extremely glad I chose the way I did. While V did have many ""comic book"" aspects to it, do not confuse it with The Hulk, Spiderman, or even Batman. This movie had a distinct character of its very own. V had some incredibly well made scenes, and extremely well developed plot, and some of the best character involvement I have experienced in a movie. You get drawn in by the dark, idealistic ways of the symbolic terrorist, by the girl who has lost it all, and by the people set on doing whats right in their hearts and minds.<br/><br/>If you have reservations, much like I did at first, of passing this movie off as another comic-based mishap, I urge you to reconsider.

","Greetings again from the darkness. First time director James McTeige has to feel like he won the lottery. Handed an outstanding cast, a terrific screenplay based on a popular graphic novel and the magic of the Wachowski Brothers (""The Matrix""), McTeige must be giddy just being part of this spectacular production.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving stars as V, a revolutionary terrorist out for revenge and some overall world-saving. Wearing a very cool mask and twirling ultra sleek ginsu knives, V takes revenge on those who experimented on him and others with a very nasty virus. Along the way, he stumbles on a real cutie in Evey (Natalie Portman) who just happens to be the offspring of some infamous revolutionaries. The relationship between V and Evey is the heart of the film and very interesting to follow. They are being chased by a detective played by Stephen Rea who seems to be smarter than the Orwellian dictator played by a way-overacting John Hurt. His characters name is Adam Sutler, which is (not coincidently) similar to Adolph Hitler.<br/><br/>The story is kind of unique in that it works in so many aspects of history while staying centered on our fictional characters. Something tells me the fun game to play once this is released on DVD will be counting the ""V"" references throughout. Early on, Weaving has a soliloquy that must utilize 93% of the V words in Webster's. It is quite a challenge to follow the first time through. In addition to the spoken V words, the number of ""V""isuals is astonishing.<br/><br/>Don't be disappointed that we never get to see Portman (with her Sinead O'Connor look) actually fight. This is not really a huge action picture, although there are some stunning moments. This is much more of a political statement that can be twisted to fit any country at any time. The Wachowski brothers once again break new ground and it is definitely worth watching a time or two."

","Having followed the film's production for a year, I couldn't wait to see this film earlier today.<br/><br/>Overall it impressed me; based on a graphic novel and a comic released during the 80's, the film is set in London, after the third world war (which we, this time, lost). Britain is now a totalitarian society, and the United States ceases to be entirely. Controlling the British government is madman Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt), who gets concerned when a rebellious anti-hero known only as V (Hugo Weaving) blows up London landmark buildings. Dressed as Guy Fawkes, V plans to destroy the houses of parliament as part of his war against the oppressive regime. He teams up with unlikely ally Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>This film does not, as hinted in trailers, have a great deal of action; but where there is action, it's spectacular. Instead the film focuses on characters Evey and V, and their respective backgrounds and reasons for hating the government. V systematically goes about terminating all of the leaders of the government until he feels justice has been done. The V character is intriguing; well played by Hugo Weaving, even if his real face isn't seen at all! He's very knowledgeable in all subjects, and unmatched in combat; Weaving portrays this well along with some nice comic touches here and there, as you become more familiar with the character. Portman is at her best, too; managing to convey the horror of the nightmares through which her character has suffered. The supporting cast all give solid performances, with a nod, in particular to John Hurt who's character is never seen in the flesh; only on a monitor/television screen.<br/><br/>I really would recommend this one; I myself will have to go and see it again. It's not watered down by needless action or CGI; everything's done for a reason and it comes together extremely well.<br/><br/>Mark my words; this will develop a cult following over the coming years!"
"NyghtOwl","9","4","9","19 March 2006"," V for re-View
","The latest film from the Wachowski Brothers, this adaptation of Alan Moore's dark, brilliant graphic novel is the movie that this country needs to see. For the uninitiated, V for Vendetta is the story of a scarred, masked vigilante fighting against the forces of fascist Britain in the year 2015. Inspired by the actions of 17th century proto-terrorist Guy Fawkes (who tried to blow up Parliament in an act still known as the Gunpowder Plot, V moves that story forward into a nightmare world, where politicians control the airwaves, music and art are banned and the subways are shut down so that the populace may be better controlled. Sound familiar, dear reader?<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving gives the performance of his career--part of the fun of this is it's like The Matrix but you get to root for Agent Smith. Concealed for the entire film behind a grinning Guy Fawkes mask--itself eerily reminiscent of the current spate of Burger King commercials, V encounters Evey (pronounce it) and enlists her aid in his explosive crusade. Weaving is physically elegant, and uses his voice through the mask to amazing effect--the performance recalls Andy Serkis' work as Gollum and King Kong.<br/><br/>As Evey, Natalie Portman is here the professional actress who first dazzled us in Leon. Surrounded by a solid cast, including Stephen Fry, John Hurt, and Stephen Rea, the movie resonates with echos of great art works that have gone before it, from Beethoven's opera ""Fidelio"" to the Ring Cycle and the Matrix trilogy. Director James McTeague keeps the action moving along, but the viewer must also pay attention to the dialogue and narration--this is a dense movie and your concentration is required."

Throw in CG motion trails on knives, and a love admission eerily reminiscent of the original Matrix, and this thing just overloads on cheese. The themes of good and evil, the symbolism is so over-explained and illustrated in this movie that it's almost insulting. Combine that with a ridiculous and overly simplistic plot and you get not only a numb backside, but a numb head as well.

I never read the novel that this movie was based upon, but it is quite easy to understand its implications and question yourselves about the world you live in.<br/><br/>The actors did an awesome job at portraying the characters and being the characters rather than just being actors. You really got involved in the movie, and when something happened to one of them it made your heartstrings tug. I particularly found the ending delightful despite the sorrow it ensues. The way V transformed Evey into who she was at the end was horrifying yet it made sense why he did it. And in the end it showed when she calmly watched the explosion, and explained to the detective why V did what he did and how he did it. <br/><br/>This movie targeted every aspect of your emotions: from your anger to your calm disposition, from your laughter to your tears, and from your heart to the thoughts of your mind.

","Not in a good bit has there been a movie I could not wait to review, that the second I got home I sat down at my computer and started typing. If you looking for a fantastic movie, action packed, deep in plot, and makes a statement that most think about but most cannot put to words, let alone movie. V for Vendetta was a movie for the ages that I can almost guarantee will stand up to the test of time and go down in cinematic history as one of the greats. The Wachowski brothers definitely made up for the abomination of the 2&3 matrix with this amazing work. <br/><br/>This movie reminds me a great deal in the book 1984, its message is beyond political. At first glance a viewer would see it as a message against conservatism, but as the movie unfolds you see it is against the opposite end of the spectrum too. It personifies the problems in both ends of the system. It is a message on what the world will become if we keep heading in the direction we are going in. America is destroyed from civil war, England has become ruled in Dictatorship. All that can fix what the would is heading to is a lone martyr to spark the good moral of all people, to realize that the world needs a huge change and fast. V, victim in cell 5. The one survivor of a terrible government controlled ""accident"" is this martyr. He makes a nation realize that only they can change what's happening, it had to start somewhere, and it started with him. V is an artist, a scholar, the perfect man to be the front for such an epic revolution such as this.<br/><br/>One who goes to see this movie, me included, think that this will be just another comic made into a movie, good for the action but not worth much more. But you leave the theater with a great deal more then what you expected. You leave in shock of getting something you didn't expect. That is what this movie is. Something you don't expect. I have gotten chills in movies before but I have never gotten them to the extent of watching the entire masked population of England march to see Parliaments destruction. You go expecting to see just another super hero, but what you get is a normal man who just has a message, an idea, and ideas cannot be destroyed. instead of your super hero you get a very determined victim who is more of a villain in his own right. Its hard to express but, he is a different, almost refreshing antagonist for a movie such as this. One of the things that set this movies realism was how very possible all the events could be, in some form or another. It is set in the near future, and is all very believable witch makes you think...what is our world really coming to.<br/><br/>This movie is very political, but it is incredibly hard to disagree with. This is due to the fact that its statement is against more then just conservatism, or liberalism, or anything, it has messages against everything so in some points of the movie there are things you will agree with, and that you will absolutely disagree with, but it is that that makes you realize the full ideals that this movie has.

","In the first 10 minutes, after killing some thugs who wanted to rape Natalie Portman (Evey), V utters a string of words that mostly start with V. This scene spark of a chain of very very witty scenes, and including the many scenes where Sutler(the ruler of the nation) appears on the big TV screen to command his followers.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman acted very appropriately, the pain she has to go through to be loyal to her beliefs, the nonchalant and acceptance when she push the lever of the train, and the intensity in her eyes when she kissed V. I never thought she could act so well, but this film seems to bring the best in her.<br/><br/>The direction of this film is near perfect, with very fast sequences, very swift action scenes - in some ways similar to John Woo and Roman Polanski combine into one.<br/><br/>I am also Alan Moore's fan and this movie ranks up there with my favorite other comic-inspired movie like Batman and SinCity.<br/><br/>The movie far exceeds my expectations. I would have given a 11-point rating if there is one."

","As good as it gets. The movie was refreshing, the ideas were liberating, the entertainment value... priceless.<br/><br/>Definitely see it... for the directing, the acting, the special effects and certainly the story.<br/><br/>Its a movies about Vendetta... revenge, vengeance. I hope that no one goes in expecting a story about Gandhi. Its about V, a freedom fighter, who fights the oppression of a dictator-like chancellor by terrorizing him and his politicians. He meets EV along the way who unwillingly becomes a major part of his crusade. <br/><br/>The story certainly bears some similarities with reality. As they say in the film 'an artist uses lies to tell the truth'. So also do the artists who are responsible for this masterpiece of fiction. Its hard to ignore the the resemblance it bears to the way of the world today and how we are trading in our freedom for the promise of safety and security.<br/><br/>But politics aside, I highly recommend this film just purely for the fresh and entertaining film that it is."

But not all hope is lost, for an anarchist has come to save us from ourselves. His name is V (Hugo Weaving) and he has not forgotten ""freedom"" and it is not just a word to him.<br/><br/>This is an excellent movie. It hits hard the problems of today. As we find ourselves being robbed of our civil liberties by a pack of sniveling fear-mongers. As we find ourselves in a world where our religion has quickly become the only thing that matters, and crimes committed by those that claim to be heads of religion are allowed to get away with horrid crimes. As we find that the line between ""hero"" and ""villain"" is quite easy to cross, if it exists at all.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving deserves an Oscar nomination at least. He won't get it, but someones got to admit that it's pretty damn hard to act and show emotion and charisma inside a mask. He is a formidable presence as the charming and devilish anarchist V. Natalie Portman isn't quite as good, but she's still very convincing as the vulnerable, but not too vulnerable Evey.<br/><br/>As one of my earlier comments might have indicated, I was grimly satisfied at the inclusion of a pedophile priest. SOMEONE had to include it in a movie sometime.<br/><br/>The effects are spectacular and the dialog is too. I enjoyed the brutal hard hitting fight sequences quite a bit.<br/><br/>It will be snubbed all around, but V for Vendetta is an amazing movie with numerous references to our own situation with George W.

","In the near future, after the United States collapses and England is plagued by a biological terror attack, a Christian fundamentalist (John Hurt) is elected chancellor, and immediately enforces Nazi-esquire restrictions and curfews. He creates a propaganda ministry which controls all media, and a secret police called the fingermen.<br/><br/>Evey (Natalie Portman) is an aspiring actress who works as an assistant at the state-run TV station. One night, she is accosted by three fingermen. Out of the shadows comes a mysterious man (Hugo Weaving) wearing a cape and a Guy Fawkes mask, and referring to himself only as V. He is trained in hand-to-hand fighting and speaks poetically and articulately.<br/><br/>The following morning, he attacks the TV station where Evey works. He forces them to play a DVD, in which he explains his admiration for Guy Fawkes, his grievances with the government, and his intention to do what Fawkes failed to accomplish 400 years ago: blow up Parliament. Feeling obligated to help the vigilante who saved her, she helps him escape when the police surround him.<br/><br/>As Evey and V become friends, we learn that her entire family fell victim to the government, as did V. He is not just fighting for the freedom of England, but for his own personal vendetta against those who made him the monster he knows he is.<br/><br/>Stephen Rea is well cast in support as Inspector Finch, assigned to find V and bring him to justice. Hugo Weaving creates a sympathetic vigilante, despite the fact that we never see his face. Natalie Portman is perfect as Evey, the character she famously shaved her head to play.<br/><br/>Many of the themes have been examined before, most obviously in George Orwell's masterpiece ""1984,"" but also in the second ""Star Wars"" trilogy, in which politician uses a crisis to force himself into the position of a supreme leader. What is new is the dilemma of who is a freedom fighter and who is a terrorist.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" is intelligent and disturbing. The imagery is beautifully artistic, the characters complex and sympathetic, and the future frighteningly Orwellian. The final battle between V and the police is gratuitously violent and unrealistic, but it makes a point: Ideas cannot die and one man can make a difference."

","All throughout this film felt like it was made cheaply and without much care. Despite that, it starts off fairly well, and has some good ideas. However, it is rather pretentious and the script strains under the effort of making everything fit into one central idea, which is flogged to its figurative death. It seems the Wachowski brothers are desperately trying to make a film with 'meaning', but are unable to do so.<br/><br/>In terms of the cast, Hugo Weaving is the highlight, as the titular V. Natalie Portman does a fine job of looking pretty, but her attempt at a British accent is very poor indeed.<br/><br/>The script is passable, but the direction doesn't even manage to do it justice. If the script was better, I could forgive the lazy direction; if the direction were more accomplished, I could forgive the pretentiousness of the dialogue and the cereal box philosophy.<br/><br/>An opportunity missed."

","The problem of V for Vendetta isn't the cast, the screenplay or the director. It's the source material. Don't get me wrong, the graphic novel is very good, but it works only as a graphic novel. The story is ""more from the same"". Another 1984-like England, another dictatorship (that could be right or left). It's the kind of story that works in an 80s comic book, and very well, but gets annoyingly repetitive in a modern movie. There are very good aspects, of course. The visual atmosphere is excellent, V is a very charismatic revolutionary (I won't call that a hero), even though we can't see his expressions and I admit I liked Evey better in the movie than in the graphic novel. But these good point don't make up to the feeling of dejá-vu. It seemed a little too popcorn politics to me and, worst of all, old popcorn politics. And honestly, 10 years after I read the novel for the first time, I must say... 1984 isn't really that amazing."

The London scenery is a perfect setting for a movie like this and it makes everything look pleasingly familiar. But there is one thing you should consider if you haven't seen this movie yet, it isn't a straight out action-movie, it also contains quite a bit of drama and history (which in this case makes the movie even better), but the movie never gets too slow and is a rare gem, that everyone should watch."
"alan_wyper","3","3","6","3 January 2007"," 1984 the panto
","This film clearly has pretensions towards political profundity, but is really just a pantomime of comic book villains kitted out in fascist jackboots to try and lend it a veneer of seriousness.<br/><br/>Set in a near future fascist UK there are inevitably numerous nods made towards Orwell's masterpiece 1984. Unfortunately for the film-makers their own work can only emerge from this juxtaposition looking even sillier. Matters are not improved by some ham-fisted attempts to link this future world's totalitarian predicament in with the current ""War on Terror"". These amount to nothing more than the usual whiny dinner-party critiques, which the film-makers would like to kid us are intellectually daring and important.<br/><br/>Visually the film does successfully capture its intended comic book aesthetic. However, if like me you are not a fan of comic books this will be of limited interest.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it is no more than adequate, although this probably says more about the script than the actors. In fact there are a number of reliable character actors like Stephen Rea and John Hurt in supporting roles. They just look very much like they're thinking of their fees.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman, whose performance has been praised to the rafters in so many other posts, is really no more than OK. She just about manages to hold that absurdly posh, cut-glass English accent all American actresses seem to adopt whenever they play a Brit, presumably coaching themselves by watching Brief Encounter. If ever a Hollywood actress manages a convincing Geordie or Scouse accent, then I'll be impressed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hugo Weaving does what he can with a character who spends the entire film running around in a Guy Fawkes mask. But the fact is there's no real character there for him to play. Just an overblown comic book caricature.<br/><br/>Just to cap the whole sorry experience, the film finishes with an ending which I can only describe as sanctimonious, implausible drivel. Safe to say I won't be rushing back for a second viewing."

","The most important thing that anyone will ever remember about Ernesto Guevara de la Serna is that he was on a t-shirt worth $9.95. I'm sure el Che would be so proud. d With plenty of special effects and changes to the script, the graphic novel becomes a different film. It goes from being about anarchy in the UK to an American left wing, Hollywood/political machination.<br/><br/>If the script was written in the 90s, and the graphic novel written in the 80s, how could it possibly include slights against Dubya? So people would watch and love it and feel a little more like a rebel when they buy the special deluxe edition 2-disc director's cut unrated edition for $24.99.<br/><br/>The movie is suddenly more popular and especially more marketable than the book once it's against Bush. Because it's popular these days. The media must be controlled and must have an enemy. Wait, 'adapting' a book to follow a political agenda, doesn't that sound a little too Orwellian? I doubt they would've have made the film honestly if it didn't have an ulterior motive.<br/><br/>And if you polish some of V's less attractive attributes (let's have him make Evey eggs in a basket because it makes him more of a swell guy), he seems so much more likable after such a small gesture. V is an amoral antihero, with no qualms about murder. But the movie clarifies the black and white so you don't have to, because they don't want the audience to question V's motives, just smile and nod.<br/><br/>Quoting Alan Moore:""(The movie) has been ""turned into a Bush-era parable by people too timid to set a political satire in their own country.... It's a thwarted and frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by neoconservatives  which is not what the comic 'V for Vendetta' was about. It was about fascism, it was about anarchy, it was about England."" If the guy who wrote the original wants nothing to do with the movie, to quote one of my least favorite comedians ""there's your sign""."
"general-melchett","5","3","6","1 November 2006"," Not overwhelming.
","Am I the only person who didn't like this film? Basically, all it involved is a lot of shouting men, repetitive scenes in offices and V's chamber, the stupid bloke on the huge screen who tried to deliver unforgettable lines that would be remembered in cinema forever (but failed), and that stupid news reporter who kept shouting, swearing and saying, ""England prevails."" The acting is also pretty wooden, and there is no way the action explodes in this film - there is hardly any action in the whole thing. The ending was sadly poor, and though the action sequences were well-done and directed, there were too few of them to satisfy most people's tastes. Arty-farty flashbacks with voiceovers just don't cut the cheese any more, and with forgettable music and acting, this film let me down. It should not be on the Top 250 - no way.<br/><br/>This film also tried to tackle topics that were way over its head, such as sexual corruption in the Church, but be honest, that was better done in the Blackadder 2 episode ""Money"". Dull and way-overrated, V For Vendetta joins Catwoman as a poor graphic-novel adaptation (well, it does in my opinion). Not great. 5/10 <br/><br/>P.S.

","With all the hype leading up to V For Vendetta and myself being one of the followers I was looking forward to seeing V For Vendetta. V For Vendetta had mixed reviews on release and even many of the cult followers of the original comic book series felt cheated. The people who actually liked V For Vendetta most are the people who seemed to have not been following all the press up to release.<br/><br/>Not only is V For Vendetta a film that lacks a back-story to the film's main premise, it also lacks any kind of resolution. You'd never know that Hugo Weaving is the man under the mask because that's basically all he is throughout the film. Yet he creates a certain mystery to the already iconic ""Guy Fawke's mask"" becoming what is a somewhat intelligent terrorist, there seems no reason behind his odd attempt to over through the government and yet he still remains an interesting character even when he just rhymes descriptive words. All sounds a little strange I guess? Well it is and throughout the entire film I found myself wondering if the movie could become even more over dramatic, over acted and yes sadly extremely over the top.<br/><br/>V For Vendetta is filmed through a very strange visual style and one that at first I found very hard to get my head round. The bright colours and vivid fantasy look was one that I personally am not a fan of. I'm not quite sure if V For Vendetta was attempting to be realistic at showing a future where the government provoke fear into the hearts of every human being. V For Vendetta gives a vibe of ""I hate everything to do with our governments"" which I personally feel is a very generalised and over used concept.<br/><br/>The film's story and entertainment are the only things that keep the film together, even the acting from John Hurt is disappointing (If you can call it acting) and Hugo Weaving is not even acting he's just proving he's got a voice talent. Natalie Portman also disappoints with a bland role where the emotion feels very fake. The film has gigantic pacing problems and the end feels very abrupt, as well as ridiculous.<br/><br/>I don't recommend V For Vendetta, as it is often dull and over the top. To think that the film was created by the minds that warped The Matrix makes the film all the more disappointing. No way does it live up to the masterpiece that is The Matrix and V For Vendetta in the end achieves next to nothing. A contrived and messy waltz of nonsense."
"m0rg16","8","3","6","10 September 2006"," It's good, but it's not great.
","I love sci-fi films. And I also love films that depict a utopian fantasy society, or dystopian rundown waterhole. I lump these into two different categories. Utopian society films are usually films where everything seems to be great, but when in actuality there is something very wrong. The public enjoys great health and luxury, but behind the facade the public is being oppressed. Examples like Equilibrium, Rollerball and Brazil come to mind.<br/><br/>Dystopian films usually depict a society where everything is just outright wrong, but freedom still exists. The world is, pretty much, a crap hole in either a very literal sense or for the people who live there. The world makes no attempt to cover up the fact that it is a crap hole, and the people don't really seem to mind either. Here we have Blade Runner and Gattaca.<br/><br/>The V for Vendetta film falls into the former category, but I wonder if you wouldn't put the comic book in the later category? In the film everything is to black and white. The good guys is too much of a good guy, the bad guy is an over-the-top bad guy and clichés are numerous.<br/><br/>If you just watch the film without prior knowledge about the comic book, you won't really care. But if you've read the comic book and know what it could have been, you'll realize that there could have been so much more to this film and a lot of it's faults are exposed. Stylistically this film is very good, but plot wise it's... not so good.<br/><br/>We've seen all of this before. A revolutionary fighting to bring down the corrupt oppressive society, where a dictator rules supreme. The twist is that this revolutionary is using modern day terrorist tactics, involving murder and bombings to further his cause. But since the film depicts him as very much of a good guy, his motives are never really questioned by the audience, like they SHOULD be. He's a good guy fighting for justice and revenge, what's not to like? Well, the problem is that we've seen this before. To many times, perhaps. The mere fact that he's using drastic measures isn't enough to make us dislike him.<br/><br/>And the bad guy? Well, compared to him, our good guy revolutionary looks like Jesus himself. This makes the film a bit dull, because we can all pretty much pinpoint exactly how the plot is going to develop from scene 1 and in the end we're right.<br/><br/>Now, the film is very well made. It's very stylistic and builds up quite nicely. If you like these kind of films, you'll like this one. The acting is great, the visuals fantastic and the atmosphere likewise. But the plot is lacking, and there's nothing really unique about this film.<br/><br/>So I suggest you watch this film if you're interested in this theme. But don't fool yourself, there are a lot of films out there on the same subject that are better. Including all of those I mentioned in the first two paragraphs.<br/><br/>6/10"

Strong storyline - and quite topical too, with recent attempts by the current UK government to outlaw gatherings, protests etc - and some great acting from the entire cast. Portman is predictably good, V himself is rather amusing (his alliterative speech at the beginning of the film is a work of art on the part of the scriptwriter and well delivered - I wonder how many dubs it took?) and the supporting cast are all great. Even Stephen Fry, who's normally entirely bland and overrated, managed a sterling performance.<br/><br/>English accents only slipped a couple of times in the film, which isn't bad either!

The action scenes are well set and the movie is carried out flawlessly. Albeit a movie out of its time it still delivers a punch and the well rounded casts make it a worthwhile movie to watch.

It is a movie filled with depth, beautiful story, well executed timing, great dialogue, great action and interesting characters.

V is the current definition of a terrorist that uses his strengths to try and convince the people of his country to repel the insidious leaders that have implemented a fascist regime.

","Discount the fact that this is adapted from Alan Moore's wonderful comic, and you'll find a film that retains a lot of the great elements of the source material while combining enough elements in its own right to create a well timed film that is both exciting, and though-provoking.<br/><br/>First off, this is a fun film to watch. It is full of action, suspense, and very interesting characters. V is presented initially as a vigilante, acting against the government with a sort of madness that like our heroine, Evey, we can't decide if he's insane or if he's right. V is a very literate, skilled fighter. Though some may mistake the acting as a bit too much melodrama, Hugo Weaving plays him quite well, capturing the madness, mystique, and the overall marvel of our hero. As Evey, Natalie Portman plays her with initial curiosity and fear and shifts the character as strong and independent over the course of the film. Given the larger than life premise of the film, the believability of the actors is one of the key successes of this film. Rounding out the cast are Stephen Rea, comedian Stephen Fry, and the infallible John Hurt, playing a highly unlikeable High Chancellor.<br/><br/>The subject matter of the film has come under much debate, as V is clearly noting that something is very wrong with the country he and his fellow citizens live in. He chooses to act and encourages others to act against a government that is robbing the country of its freedoms. Though not quite 1984, the film illustrates a government not far removed from some of our fears today. V drops quotes throughout the movie as a sort of warning and foreshadowing about the power the people have over the government. The finale can be seen as an act of just retaliation or an act of terrorism, depending on your viewpoint. The story is told in such a way, that it is, to me, brilliant satire, exhilarating and fun to watch, without being too preachy.<br/><br/>That the source material is almost 20 years old and that the themes in the story are even more timed today illustrates the brilliance of the story. But this is also a fun film to watch. There are fun action scenes throughout this film, including some great knife play by V and a very chilling third act. Intelligent, and fun, the film is a cautionary tale timed very well in these troubled times."

","Awe-inspiring, and brilliantly written, V for Vendetta should be shown in every school, every workplace and every house in the United States. It represents the very best of what film-making can be - a truly transformative experience that breaks the barrier separating fiction from real life. Much of the disgraceful behavior of the Bush Administration is acted out by a fictional British totalitarian regime. A regime that rules by fear and intimidation; that utilizes torture and imprisonment without a trial. It turns the paradigm of the good State fighting the evil terrorist on it's head, making the terrorist the patriot, and the government - evil. V for Vendetta reminds everyone who sees it what a powerful instrument of change art can be."

","Phenomenal film! I couldn't take my eyes of it, partially because of the fascinating action but mostly because of the incredible plot that got me thinking days after the film...Character of V is really incredible and well presented in the film by Hugo Weaving.As a reader of the comic i have to say that film has more action and it's kind of...faster, you know what i mean? Natalie Portman also has a significant role as Evey, V's only helper. Best scene, to me, is the one on the beginning when V is destroying all those buildings while the classical music plays loudly in the background.It really looks as a perfect introduction to the spectacle that follows...After all, you got to give credit to Alan Moore who deserves all the praise for the story. James McTeigue made it big time, and as for the Wachowski brothers, you can only say...THEY DID IT AGAIN!"

","This is hands down the best movie of the past year, and quite likely the best film that I have ever seen. The social commentary, while quite pertinent to our time, is forever a truthful reflection about the power of the people when it comes to government: ""People should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people."" While many people saw this film as a criticism of the Bush administration, it isn't necessarily so, although many of the happenings in the film are surprisingly relevant to our government. The graphic novel was published long before the administration took power, which is probably why the movie is so striking at this point in time. So much of what goes wrong in the film can be seen today in our society - governments spying citizens, people openly giving up freedoms, it is a haunting reflection of our lives. I don't want to spoil the fun, but you need to see this film - it has heart and soul, a wonderful and surprisingly intelligent plot, and plenty of action for anyone's taste. A perfect balance of drama, romance, comedy, and action. I can't wait to buy it on DVD!"

I thought the acting was a 9.5 by the two leads (Portman,Weaving). Just listening to the lines delivered by ""V"" was almost musical it was so beautifully done. Natalie Portman is a delight in anything she is in. She simply raises the bar for the other actresses in her age group. In this film she displays a maturity beyond her years which she has conveyed before (see-""Beautiful Girls""). My only problem with this movie; & it is a minor one, is that it seemed a tad long. Perhaps an editing issue with me. That is what had me wavering between a 7-8. The supporting cast was fine if not outstanding. They were all very adequate in their roles.

","Any fan of the comic will be disappointed : V is no more genius, only a crazy guy who never knows what to do, and doesn't a *single* time in the movie says the word ""anarchy"" Eric Finch doesn't use his mind anymore but instead has ""intuitions"" The Commander is no more a dangerous thinking head of state but a small hysterical man who looks more like Hitler than Big Brother.<br/><br/>Alan Moore was right to quit this project, and the Wachowsky brothers have shown that the Matrix was just a one time thing, they won't be able to do a great film, even given a great scenario.<br/><br/>I think that the worse is the political twist made to the story. To quote Moore himself : They ""turned into a Bush-era parable by people too timid to set a political satire in their own country.... (This film) is a thwarted and frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by Neo-Conservatives  which is not what (the comic) 'V for Vendetta' was about.""<br/><br/>Plus, you'll remark that some little ""details"" have been erased from the script.

"pwsull","10","3","6","19 April 2006"," The Best Cautionary Tales Entertain
","The comments and reviews (both amateur and professional) on this film here at IMDb and elsewhere seem to run at polarized ends of the spectrum: you either love it or hate it. In my experience, that usually indicates a great, provocative movie that sinks its hooks into you emotionally, and makes you think. This movie has gotten so far under my skin that I feel the need to add some comments about it in a more personal tone than you will find in my more formal and ""intellectual"" review at Netflix (under the name Philip Sullivan). First let me be clear that 1) I am a major league movie watcher and fan, and surprisingly 2) I find myself more in love with this movie than I have been with any other film in many years. My tastes are eclectic, and not wed to any particular genre, but I tend to get hooked by the tragic, romantic, and epic; and good science fiction has been a favorite since modern special effects have made the visual experience credible. I rarely go to the theater these days, generally preferring the convenience and economy of waiting for netflix to deliver my entertainment to my home theater. But my thirteen year old son asked me to take him to V about a month ago, and now I have been back to see it two more times (including a one hour, 40 mile trip to see it in IMAXno better indication of movie love than that). People who pan this movie seem to fall into two basic categories: Alan Moore comic book lovers who can't stand the way the Wachowski brothers translated it to the screen; and intellectuals who enjoy picking away at the story, themes, and messages. All literature and all films are imperfect, and you can always find things about a creative work to criticize, sneer at, and devalue. Sure there are some plot holes, over-simplified morality, a blatant political message, Wachowski excesses, and a purposely ambiguous and romanticized view of terrorism. You can level similar, negative criticisms at a host of movies that are considered ""Great"". To choose just one, think about Casablanca. Talk about over-simplified morality and a blatant political message in a movie! But it has gone on to be considered one of the greatest movies of all time. So come on guys, it's just a movie! ... Entertainment! No one is advocating terrorism, or revolution, but the movie is trying to provoke broader thinking than the narrow, nationalistic, Christian patriotism gripping us since 9/11. In V, director James McTeigue and the writing/producing Wachowskis are melding 2006 box office movie making with a political and moral cautionary tale. If you like your special effect, ""action"" movies unadulterated by content that makes you think and feel perplexed or uncomfortable, don't go see this movie. If you think narrow morality, right wing conservative politics, and fundamentalist religious beliefs are the direction we should be going in, you won't like this film because it tells a story in which those beliefs take us back to fascist totalitarianism. On a superficial viewing you could say V is just the Wachowskis doing ""Matrix meets 1984 by way of The Count of Monte Cristo"". But I think you'd do better to delve deeper on both an emotional and idea level. Action, drama, mood, mystery, romance, tragedy, political intrigue, special effects that go ""boom"", great and moving acting, and perfectly matched music.this film has all of that. So, if you think you are anything like me, go see it. You'll love it too!"
"daviddesancho","6","3","6","19 April 2006"," You could have it so much better (with Alan Moore)
","'V for Vendetta' is a well intended film for today's audience. As many other science fiction movies, like Matrix or Blade Runner, it presents a could be-world in which freedom is an underrated right, and a character who is willing to put things upside-down. So, as every dystopia attempts, it makes you think. It is interesting in that the film is absolutely not a follow up to Neo's special effect nightmares. In fact there's only one sequence that will satisfy the people of that likes. But regrettably neither the film is well directed nor did the Wachowskis write a screenplay that raises questions in depth. The filming language is extremely poor in some sequences, like those of the burning birth of V at Larkhill, or the ones about the lesbian couple. A somewhat shallow film, though the strength of the comic books remains in the character of V. Besides, it's always pleasure to see Ms. Portman and hear Julie London's 'Cry me a river'."

The movie is a little slow around the middle but all falls together at the end. V is a character that I unexpectedly found myself looking up to. Great performances by all the cast, especially Hugo Weaving. You will appreciate your own freedom much more after watching V for Vendetta. Pyrotechnics can only be described as spectacular. Fans of the Matrix trilogy will find themselves in familiar territory here. There are a couple of scenes that are a cheeky tribute to the Wachowski Brother's former efforts.

","A good movie will entertain you. These days it seems like such an impossible feat -- the purest element of cinema is overlooked, that it's relieving to see a movie like V for Vendetta, that has its heart so deeply in creativity and controversy. So this amazing movie does what it's suppose to, except it stays with you long after you stop watching it, and then you are watching memorable scenes in your head. This movie is the best bee sting I've ever had. It's a marriage of elements mystery, fantasy and mind blowing action sequences that effectively tells a story of terrorism and a totalitarian society and gives us a feeling of hope. It gives so much and in return asks for so much, that the average audience member may dismiss it as too cluttered and political.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving, gives an amazing verbal performance, as V, the man that hides behind a mask, his smoothing voice is reassuring in a twisted sort of way. Natalie Portman as Evey Hammond, stumbles a little over her English accent, but she is actually powerful and effective as a woman who has lost her inner strength.<br/><br/>I applaud V for Vendetta's boldness, strength and the way it found a reflection, a romance in a story about terrorism."
"darth_random","6","3","6","18 April 2006"," A Very Hollywood Revolution
","V for Vendetta begins with quite a spectacle: a mysterious masked man with a penchant for alliteration saves a young woman (Evey, played by Natalie Portman) from being raped by a gang of secret policemen. He whisks her to the rooftops of London to put on a show he has prepared. Suddenly, the street fills with the sound of the 1812 Overture and the Old Bailey explodes, with fireworks shooting up into the air.<br/><br/>Written by the Wachowski brothers and directed by their protégé and former assistant director James McTiegue, V for Vendetta is based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd (although Moore has distanced himself from the film). In a near-future London, a fascist government led by Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has arisen from the ashes of a War on Terror that has seen the USA collapse into civil war and disorder and Britain devastated by a mysterious biological warfare attack. Sutler's regime has a little bit of everything: the 'Big Brother' style surveillance that one can gradually see popping up in London today through CCTV cameras, a Fox News-style media outlet (complete with a British version of Bill O'Reilly), a strong dislike of gays and Muslims, and for good measure, the traditional icons of old-school Euro-fascism (big red and black flags, etc).<br/><br/>Pitted against the Government is V (Hugo Weaving), a vigilante in a Guy Fawkes mask who promises that in one year, his revolution will reach its climax as he completes Fawkes' original goal in 1605 by blowing up Parliament. The government immediately begins searching for V and his new accomplice Evey with an investigation headed up by a weary Scotland Yard chief inspector (Stephan Rea). As the police work to track down V, who is causing havoc all over the place, the inspector pieces together the puzzle: V is hunting down the staff of a concentration camp that seems to have disappeared from all government and military archives. As the clock ticks closer to Guy Fawkes day on the 5th of November, V's plans are set in motion as the police struggle to keep up.<br/><br/>There's a lot to like about V for Vendetta. Despite resorting to some obvious choices (the Chancellor appears only on a giant screen projected into a black, cavernous room and the regime's red and black crucifix-style symbol hangs everywhere), the movie looks stunning. And the performances from Weaving (masked the entire film), Portman and the supporting cast are all excellent.<br/><br/>Ultimately, V for Vendetta's problem is that it takes the easy road. It boldly claims to ask the question whether one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, but then robs the audience of a legitimate choice. V is not a terrorist. He doesn't terrorize anyone. Instead, he seems to deliberately avoid directly harming civilians at all. V attacks and kills the guilty: concentration camp governors, corrupt and deviant enforcers, brutal secret police officers. He seeks only for some kind of return of Britain's liberal democratic traditions. The government, on the other hand, seems to lack any support from the people (who swap over to V's side as soon as they see him), murders its citizens by the thousands and clamps down on all that is good in the world. Is there ever any doubt as to whether we should root for V? Or whether his methods are justified? V for Vendetta clearly wants to be more than an action movie. It wants to be an allegory about the War on Terror and the erosion of civil liberties that comes with it. It wants to be a shout of political frustration about the way the West is headed. It wants to be a macabre celebration of people power. But the whole thing seems too sanitized, too easy, too Hollywood. For a movie that tries so very hard to be controversial, it winds up being some of the best mainstream entertainment so far this year."
"Justin-Kamal","10","3","6","17 April 2006"," A spectacle worthy of admiration!
","Upon first hearing the news of the Wachowski brothers releasing yet another highly anticipated movie, I was persistent to watch it as soon as possible. With the overwhelming world-wide success of ""The Matrix"" trilogy, ""V for Vendetta"" was set to become yet another spectacle to be praised by generations to come.<br/><br/>Supported by a highly complex and puzzling plot, this psychological thriller captures your attention from the very beginning and throws you into a world of lies and puzzles where you piece together the pieces to reveal the shocking and troubling truth. Evey is an average working woman whose life changes drastically when she is rescued by a mysterious stranger from a gang of corrupt policemen. Returning the favor, she helps him escape arrest and gets knocked out. Feeling sympathy for the heroic young lady, V takes her to his lair where he reveals to her his mission. They help each other overcome the hardships and obstacles of their oppressive world.<br/><br/>The story is set in London in a time not too far from the present. After epidemics and wars strike the world, a dictatorial government takes control of London and transforms it into a regime much similar to that of Germany during World War 2. Using fear and deception, the government controls the people like puppets and robs them of their rights, money, and liberties at will. Escaping from what seems like a concentration camp, V takes his fate into his own hands and decides to correct the wrongs of the government and lead the people in revolution.<br/><br/>The astounding special effects are perhaps only exceeded by the unprecedented and skillful performances by Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. The movie is a wonderful and accurate depiction of the graphic novels which they are based off and the additional skill and powerful writing ability of the Wachowski brothers place this film high above today's standards and welcome it as an alteration to the extremely popular Comedy genre that is sweeping the world.<br/><br/>Definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen.

","I went to see this film for the one reason that it had received a lot of press attention and mixed reviews, and I wanted to have an opinion myself. I didn't expect to be impressed, and I was right, I wasn't. I was blown away! <br/><br/>I'm wasn't a fan of the films I had seen that had originated from graphic novels (being very disappointed with From Hell) until I saw Sin City (anyone who hasn't seen it should do so immediately!). I was convinced by a friend to come and see V for Vendetta at the cinema and not wait for it to come out on DVD like I had planned to do, and I'm so glad I listened to her! <br/><br/>First of all, Hugo Weaving is superb as V, even though his face is never seen. This adds something to the film. His character is wrapped up in an enigma that unravels as the film progresses. It is done in such a good way, mainly by the use of flash backs and memories of the different characters in the film.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the fact that there is very little mention of what had happened before the events of the film start, so it leaves you to concentrate more on what's happening in the film, rather than how the events were brought about in the first place.<br/><br/>I definitely need to mention Natalie Portman, who, in this film firmly establishes her status as a ""grown-up actress"", and has stepped away from the Padme type figure. Good for you Natalie! She is very impressive and her transformation during the course of this film is mesmerising.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are very good including Stephen Rea as the brooding Inspector Finch and John Hurt as the terrifying and power obsessed Chancellor Sutcliffe. The only person I was disappointed with was Stephen Fry, who is just a little bit too ""British"" in this film!<br/><br/>Overall, this film is spectacular, and refrains from the over use of slow motion, unlike the Matrix films (although, there is one scene at the end, but I suppose one is allowed!). With the excellent mixture of good performances and an original script, V for Vendetta is a voluptuous, visual, view of the veracious vigilante done in a very good way (I don' think V could have done better himself!)!

Huge chunks of the graphic novel version of ""...Vendetta"" were both lopped off and out - I definitely was not impressed! Hugo Weaving was wasted in his bemasked experience and so was Natalie Portman as a shave headed waif taken under Weaving's wing - you'd be better off sticking to the graphic novel!

","There are some that will, upon seeing this film, say that it was akin to Andrew Lloyd Weber attempting to make a political statement: overly dramatic. These people would be well served to remember that the symbol of drama is a mask, which certainly begs one important question- Why, if you are so put off by an overtly dramatic motion picture, would you choose to see a movie that stars as the (anti)hero a man in a mask? I just saw this film at an advanced screening and I must say it is nothing short of uniquely brilliant. Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure.<br/><br/>The acting, the cinematography, the effects, and the general vision of this film all lead me to believe that it will likely receive a cult following. It is only my hope that the message of this film will come to summarize the history of our future ascendancy to true liberty.<br/><br/>Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.

","For something the famed Wachowski brothers have made, this film disappointed on many levels. Being the first Wachowski screenplay since the excellent Matrix trilogy, the story jumped around more than Skippy on steroids, and I felt Hugo Weaving's character was wasted behind the mask. More background info on V would've vastly improved this film. The entire torture scene seemed pointless (not to mention long), and the detective's side story concerning the St.Mary's virus was uncomfortably slotted in, and seemed to make no sense until much later in the film. The people's characters seemed to be transported out of Eastenders, and were just frankly annoying to look at whenever they briefly appeared on the screen. I did, however, appreciate Natalie Portman's acting ability (despite her character being plonked in for no reason... why should someone wanting to blow up the Old Bailey randomly save some1 on the street first? He does'not seem to do it ever again...) and the cinematic special effects were decent (but no way as good as the Matrix). It did get me talking about recent politics, as probably was the point, but Mike Moore's ""Bowling for Columbine"" did that much better too, and that was a couple of years ago.<br/><br/>This film got the idea right, but the execution was completely wrong."

For me, if they try to portray the movie as having some revolutionary ""message"" to it that speaks to the heart of its viewers, then it should be a message that is true and not some crazy ass fundamentalist liberal, black and white, worldview.<br/><br/>Here were some things that bothered me, which prevented me from fully accepting the movie, and just having a sick feeling in the bottom of my stomach because from reading the previous reviews knew that there ACTUALLY are people out there who LOVED the movie (and it's message): 1) V says something like, ""The people should not be afraid of the government, the government should be afraid of its people."" I'm sorry, optimally the government should not be afraid of the people, nor vice versa. Optimally a government should be made up by the people and for the people. There's no ""us and them"" kind of mentality. The government should be made up of representatives of the people, who are people within themselves. . . seriously. . .<br/><br/>2) Natalie Portman thanks V near the end? What the hell? Is she some kind of sick, messed up, idiot? Does she have some kind of radical form of ""Stockholm Syndrome?"" For the love. . . the movie loses credibility when the characters are supposed to be sane. . . but act in insane ways.<br/><br/>3) That whole dancing scene. . . and this whole LOVE crap that goes on between them two. Please, PLEASE, that was unnecessary to the MESSAGE of the movie (which I disagree with), and just plain old dumb. Seriously. . . did it actually propel the movie's plot line? UNNECESSARY WASTE OF TIME. What the hell? And the cut scene from what I remember to the next wasn't very smooth.<br/><br/>Aside from my scathing remarks, this movie was solid. It had solid action, nice choreography, worth watching. . . or renting. . . or better yet, matinée. I think the biggest disappointment was revolving around how much this movie could had rawked, yet failed to completely do so because of its script material that left a bad taste in my mouth in the end.<br/><br/>I'm no idiot, and the main characters were. Sick.<br/><br/>Heck, I don't even know why I'm writing this review, because if you agree, then you'd agree, and if you disagree with me, then you probably didn't have your thinking cap on during the movie, and will probably dog me on my scalding remarks (or not even reply because of the fact that this is so late in the number of comments) But my main reason, is I'm so flabbergasted how taken away people can get for being such morons (the very same robotons in the movie) not to see how FLAWED the whole movie was. Okay, that's it. I'm done. Have a good day."

","CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! While I applaud the effort, this movie never really got my attention. I was more then a little disappointed with how the trailer for this film seemed to suggest it was an action movie....unfortunately i think there may have been MAYBE 10 min of action in the entire 2+ hours. I just couldn't get into it, i waited and waited for something to happen and was constantly let down. Although the plot line of how V came to be who he is was interesting (the government imprisoned him and others while conducting experiments on them, and he was in cell 5, the roman numeral being V) it just couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a political thriller or an action. Although I would lean towards action.<br/><br/>I guess I don't really have much else to add except, if you see this movie for the action sequences....save yourself the effort. Perhaps the Wachowski Bro's should stick to fantasy movies, because this movie really wasn't what it could have been.<br/><br/>Oh one more thing, at times I found it really difficult to hear the dialog...especially it seemed when it was most important....so if you do decide to see it, pay close attention or you'll miss important details"

","*""People should not fear their governments. Governments should fear their people!""* ""V for Vendetta"" is great fun. It is an adventure film with some serious messages included. It is usually possible to wade through the deepest ideas in an adventure film (for example, X men, Catwoman) without getting your ankles wet. This is a bit different.<br/><br/>John Hurt and Stephen Fry are always good value for money and Hugo Weaving in the title role was a revelation with his ability to create a role brilliantly while hiding behind a mask for the whole of the movie.<br/><br/>Terrorism, homophobia, racism and islamophobia are all dealt with in the film in different ways. There are chilling insights into the secret camps where alleged terrorists are tortured for the good of the state. And the media are not exonerated either.<br/><br/>Most crucially the plot shows the way the religious right can use terrorism as an excuse for repression. In the course of the narrative responsibility for a terrorist outrage is shifted to whoever is the current enemy of the state. It comes as no surprise to find out that the author of this ""9/11"" turns out to be the dictatorship itself.<br/><br/>John Hurt is very good as a dictator and he also plays a caricature of himself on a TV show hosted by Steven Fry's character, Deitrich. Deitrich falls foul of the secret police for his pains. He expected to get away with a grovelling public apology. Instead he is killed when a copy of the Koran, which he kept because of its poetry, is found in his house.<br/><br/>If you have ever had a sneaking suspicion that Guy Fawkes was the only man to enter Parliament with honest intentions, the sight of millions marching in Guy Fawkes masks to overthrow a corrupt government based on lies is inspiring.<br/><br/>And that is where the film falls short. What happens next? It is here that the emasculation of the original story is most keenly felt. The ""politics"" were not exciting and spectacular enough so they remained on the cutting room floor. The original story of V was not from a socialist but an anarchist perspective but at least didn't leave the basic questions unasked; the original message of the story has been toned down and given the Hollywood treatment.<br/><br/>I still think the film does fulfil in an attenuated form, the concept of the original writer, Alan Moore ""../the central question is, is this guy right? Or is he mad? What do you, the reader, think about this? Which struck me as a properly anarchist solution. I didn't want to tell people what to think, I just wanted to tell people to think, and consider some of these admittedly extreme little elements, which nevertheless do recur fairly regularly throughout human history.""/ You have to like action/adventure films to appreciate it but if you do, this film is for you.<br/><br/>""People should not fear their governments.

","It's the year Twenty-twenty, and our world is vastly different. England is run over by a totalitarian government, lead by a fierce Adam Sutler using fear and violence to cower people to follow his lead. A corrupt media constantly runs antisemitic, anti gay and Muslim propaganda, to 'protect' their citizens. Evey works in the media that controls and edits the news. While walking outside after curfew, Evey is attacked by the Figermen, yet like a knight in shining armour, is saved by a mysterious vigilante called V. Evey becomes marked by the government as a co-conspirator of V, after V destroys the Old Bailey Building, on the fifth of November. Following Gay Fawkes's attempt to destroy the British Paraliment, in one year times plans to to fulfill Fawkes plan, and root the fifth of November forever in history.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is not your average blockbuster film. Instead of mind blowing stunts constantly thrown at the audience, the focus is on the dilemmas on the characters. Our antihero V, is out for revenge on the government that created the man he is. Using anarchy as a weapon, V shakes the people out of their oppression and take a stand against their corrupt government. Evey, while unwillingly ends entangled into V's plan, joins V's alliance. Officer Finch starts to question his ethics of loyalty to his government, when he starts to uncover a disturbing conspiracy.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta, while based on Alan Moore's graphic novels, has a distinct similarity to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Free thought is taken away, cultures seen radical are abolished, homosexuality unaccepted, televisions everywhere watching and monitoring your conversations; Big Brother is watching. While not have read the graphic novels, V for Vendetta seems to lack that depth of the political agenda it's tackling. The political side plays second fiddle to much, when it should have been in the fore front all the time. There are some startling references to history; Nazi Germany, Gay Fawkes, while looking at our modern state; war on terrorism.<br/><br/>The problem with V for Vendetta is that it's a mix affair. The beginning is chaotic and unfocused. Much like when Neo meets the Architec in Matrix Reloaded, the Wachowski Brothers are throwing the thesaurus at you, with V spitting as many V words in one sentence. Vendetta takes its time to focus, though when it does really gets the gears moving in sync. First time director James McTeigue, does a strong job, with flare for great visuals and artistry.<br/><br/>When your face holds the most expression and insight into a person, Hugo Weaving has a hard task of bringing expression to a man behind a Gay Fawkes mask. With great mannerisms and a commanding voice, Weaving is immaculate as V. Natalie Portman does a amazing performance as Evey, even with a shaved head she is still beautiful. Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry are both great. John Hurt is disturbing as as Adam Sutler, booming with such a spiteful voice.<br/><br/>When the year Nineteen Eighty-Four approached, people wondered if George Orwell's vision of the future would come into fruition. With the year Twenty Twenty just around the corner, will V for Vendetta do the same; probably not. Though with provocative and somewhat controversial subject matter, it does raise questions, and food for thought."

","Okay...This is a combination of Phantom of the Opera (killing people, guy in a mask, etc), Beauty and the Beast (an ugly man and a beautiful woman), and a political thriller. This has to be one of the best movies that I have seen in a very long time and I would like to point out that Natalie Portman does not look half bad with her head shaved. lol. Anyway...Hugo Weaving (sorry if I didn't spell it right) is a master of all when he uses his voice in a debonair fashion, whether V is out killing those who wronged him or introducing himself to a fascinating but scared lady. Natalie Portman does very well in the transition from a scared young woman who doesn't really see herself in a life...more like a living prison...to a sort of punky, kick butt type of gal who won't take crap off of anyone simply because there is nothing new anyone else could possibly do to her that could hurt her anymore. This movie is about politics, love, family values, and standing up for what you believe to be right. No matter what the cost, no matter what could happen, or what one is threatened with. It takes a vast amount of courage to stand up for what you believe to be right. And that is exactly what this movie is about. It just so happens that they tied a love story into the folds for a little added spice and the result is a fascinating look at what one person can do to change the world."

","V for Vendetta is a combination of many things that ultimately adds up to a surprisingly enjoyable film. It is based on a comic book character but you can wipe that little fact from your memory since this is unlike any other comic book movie you have ever seen. There is no super hero aspect here that is saturated with over-the-top nonstop action and violence. While the main character V does have some very slick combat skills using only knives and swords, that is not the main focus of the storyline. Depending on your perspective V can even be seen as a anti-hero or terrorist instead of a hero.<br/><br/>This is a film that is meant to provoke thought from the viewers throughout every plot twist in the movie. There is a lot of intentional symbolic references that mirror past and present events in the world we know. This is probably a result of The Wachowski Brothers directing the film. They should have made this movie after the original Matrix instead of cashing in on lackluster Matrix sequels. I digress... V for Vendetta is set in England in the near future. The entire country is being ruled by a fascist dictator who will let nothing stand in his way of absolute control. This includes control over all media which are sometimes forced to broadcast false stories by putting a 'spin' on them. This is done to misinform the citizens for political reasons and paint the picture of V as a terrorist who must be stopped.<br/><br/>The film covers the next 12 months of V's life in which he meets Evey (played by Natlie Portman) who is a journalist for Britains largest news network. The two spend time learning of each others past history and how they became who they are today. V simultaneously spends his time pulling the citizens away from the lies the government is feeding them and instead show them the truth. He wants to hand the power to make their own decisions back into their hands. He preaches things like ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."" and ""Remember, remember the 5th of November."" All of this leads up to an exciting ending that will leave you thinking about all the ideas expressed in this film and what they mean to you. I recommend this film to anyone to go see."
"EUyeshima","8","3","6","27 March 2006"," A for AudaciousB for Execution
","Cinematic translations of graphic novels and comic books seem to be gaining prominence these days with ""Sin City"", ""A History of Violence"" and ""Aeon Flux"" as three examples of this growing genre. Here is another one adapted from a series of comic books written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd between 1982 and 1985. Produced and written by the Wachowski Brothers in their signature ""Matrix"" style and directed by their protégé James McTeigue, the movie has a wildly inventive premise that despite its twenty-year old origins has a timely relevance in a post-9/11 world. It is indeed a comic book come to life, but it's also an often powerful political allegory that takes subtle jabs at the current administrations in both the UK and the US.<br/><br/>It's all set in a dystopian London in the year 2020, a time when England has turned into a totalitarian regime under the thumb of fascist chancellor Adam Sutler. The story focuses on a young TV station assistant named Evey. On her way to meet her co-worker, TV personality Gordon Dietrich, she is caught after curfew by some thugs in a dark alley. A savior arrives in the form of a masked vigilante named V, and their ensuing relationship is what drives the labyrinth plot. Starting with the nighttime destruction of the Old Bailey, complete with fireworks and Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" blaring over loudspeakers, V orchestrates terrorist acts in a one-man attempt to usurp Sutler. Evey is frightened but ultimately intrigued by V, as her parents were taken away by Sutler's storm troopers as political agitators. She eventually seeks sanctuary with Dietrich but then gets caught in what appears to be her own purgatory. At the same time, the tenacious Inspector Finch attempts to find V before any further terrorist acts occur.<br/><br/>This apocalyptic movie dares to ask the question of whether terrorism is ever justified, and the filmmakers go about making V a scarifying but ultimately sympathetic figure. Many of the visual elements are impressive here, but various plot points do not coalesce into a coherent narrative. The Wachowskis have constructed a complex, elliptical story with so many convolutions around the various targets  the government, the media, the terrorists  that it gets difficult to keep track. Part of the problem is simply scope because the movie's agenda feels so broad as to make some of the elements feel trivial, in particular, the ""Beauty and the Beast""-cum-""Phantom of the Opera"" connection between V and Evey.<br/><br/>On the other hand, certain passages work quite well, such as the brutalizing sequence when Evey is incarcerated and she starts to read a series of notes from a prisoner named Valerie, who has been executed for being a lesbian. There are also welcome bits of humor, for example, Evey dressed in one scene as a little girl to gain the trust of a bishop critical in allowing one of V's attacks to occur, and the Benny Hill antics on Dietrich's TV show meant to ridicule both V and Sutler. With a convincing British accent, Natalie Portman is solid as Evey as she shows both her adventurous and vulnerable sides with equal aplomb. As V, Hugo Weaving does what he can behind the confines of the Joker-style mask. In an ironic twist to his role as Winston in ""1984"", John Hurt chews quite a bit of scenery in the decidedly Big Brother role of Sutler. Stephen Rea makes a subtle Inspector Finch, while Stephen Fry uses his dry comic manner to good effect as Dietrich. The movie runs a bit long at 132 minutes, but it is relentlessly creative film-making."

","V For Vendetta was one of the movies which I wasn't sure about but knew I had to see anyway. I was really hopeful that it would be a good movie and I was not disappointed one bit. V For Vendetta is an amazing movie. Hugo Weaving puts on a brilliant performance. Having to wear a mask through the whole film you expect the acting to be second degree but his body language shows his emotions perfectly and you don't even notice that the mask has a huge smile on it because of the body language and how well Weaving makes sure the audience know what mood his character is in for each scene.<br/><br/>I was glad that Weaving's character 'V' never actually took his mask off. There was one point I was worried the mask was going to come off and show a really bad make up job but the mask wasn't taken off and kept him mysterious like he was throughout until that point.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman does a good job putting on an English accent and did really well in the shaved head scene which obviously they only had one chance to do. You couldn't have asked more from her and her performance is flawless. To kiss a mask as well and make it look convincing was a hard job but she did that perfect too.<br/><br/>The film is brilliant and I couldn't have asked for more. I haven't seen many films twice at the Cinema before but I may well go see this one again soon. It also makes me want to read the Comic series. Highly Recommended."

It is a fantastic film, basically, the action sequences are amazingly done, the special effects mind-blowing, if slightly scary of the possibility of it happening in the future. However that is purely circumstantial. The Dialogue of all the characters is fixating, with V using words that at my tender 18 years i have never heard before. The sheer variety of his vocabulary is invigorating! Ill finish with a simple hint: You MUST see this film! It is fantastic, its clever use of references to George Orwells 1984, and World War II give it the ""big brother"" feel. A film which will become a cult classic!!"
"martin_g_karlsson","8","3","6","26 March 2006"," To V or not to V a Terrorist Revolutionary
","V is a knife-throwing anti-government crusader in a future fascist Britain. Fear and violence are the tools of government. V in turn uses terrorism as a means of liberation. And he drags a bald Natalie Portman along with him.<br/><br/>The story, like Orwells '1984' is not exactly subtle in its critique of authoritarian government and its call to fight for liberty by any means necessary. If you watch it, you will get it. But its still an important tale to tell, and I can imagine its quite subversive in todays US or Britain. Some of the images projected, in particular the... big thing at the end... are subversive in themselves. Extra points for the Bill O'Reilly character, spouting hateful patriotic nonsense in support of the powers that be. And for the orange Guantanamo wardrobe of the prisoners, the Emma Goldman reference: ""If I cant dance its not my revolution."" and Anthony and the Johnstons on the soundtrack. <br/><br/>Minus points for the male control fantasy, the ""conversion"" of a woman by subjecting her to imprisonment and torture. ""Its for her own good"", as wife-beaters usually tend to put it. The benevolent interpretation of this I guess would be a ""beauty and the beast"" mythology. Alan Moore has always been pretty pubertal though, in the original story, the Natalie Portman character is also a prostitute.<br/><br/>The problem otherwise, from a political perspective, is, like in 'The Matrix' films, the Messianic part. Political change is brought about by one person, an avant-garde, resorting to extreme measures. Rather than being initiated and created by the people through mass action. But hey, its Hollywood. <br/><br/>Hugo Weaving has got a great voice, Natalie Portman is fetching and compelling and Stephen Fry and Stephen Rea do what we expect from them. John Hurt is almost as megalomaniac as he was as Caligula in 'I Claudius'. The story-telling has a nice drive to it, the direction and visual aesthetics are consistent and well thought through. The plot builds well and the film gets consistently more exciting throughout its course.<br/><br/>Its great that a subversive film like this can become part of mainstream entertainment. And hey it even looks like this is going to be a Blockbuster!"

","V for Vendetta was nothing short of amazing! The acting was brilliant and the score was phenomenal (Not your breathtaking phenomenal but you get what I mean) <br/><br/>Natalie Portman did well portraying Eve, the cliché woman haunted by a bloody past. She meets her ""match"" V, and together they discover more than they ever knew they could about, their past, their environment and most of all each other.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is every political rebel's dream as all form of injustice is put on the table and avenged to the fullest. The chancellor reminded me of what a modern day Hitler would look like  physically and emotionally. What happened in those cells seems to be similar to what happened in the concentration camps back in the days. Bodies were treated as if there were mere objects one could play with and throw away. <br/><br/>V is noble, and we (the audience) surely emphasize with his pain and loneliness. We fall in love with the character, who has finally realized that life is more than just vengeance. Love exists. Furthermore, there is a way to conquer fear. When all is taken away from you, and you have been through enough pain, you've hot rock bottom and you cannot feel anything anymore, then you've faced death, and you are no longer prisoner of fear. <br/><br/>The end was beautiful. The fireworks coming together to shape a V sealed the deal. Eve ended it well for she told the inspector who had just asked her to reveal who the man in the mask was: ""He was my father, my mother, my brotherhe was you and he was me."" His soul lived through all and he lived for all."
"amoore-2","Null","3","6","25 March 2006"," This film does not entirely suck
","I first met V during the 80s in a comic called Warrior. It was a good comic and had great stories including Madman, The Legend of Prestor John, Laser Eraser and Axel Pressbutton and Marvelman. When the comic went out of print around issue 28 it left a lot of stories up in the air. So I was really happy when Alan Moore and David Lloyd finally finished off V for Vendetta as a graphic novel. I have always credited this story for my own political outlook and because of that it always had a special significance for me- I always thought that it could work on screen but probably more as a 6 part TV mini series rather than a film. I saw this film today and the only feeling I had when I left the cinema was ""bewilderment"".<br/><br/>First off I would like to say that the characterisation and choice of actors was spot on. But within the frame of the movie I have to ask the following questions: Why was Evey not prostituting herself when picked up by the Fingermen? Where was V's exploding hand? Why wasn't Protheroe the Voice of Fate? Why was the girl that says ""Bollocks"" in the wrong place? Why were the roses renamed ""Scarlet Carsons"" from ""Violet Carsons"" ? Why didn't Delia Surrage ask to see V's face one last time? When seeing the Larkhill camp explosions why wasn't V's part in it made more clearer (and where was the mustard gas?) Why didn't V tell Evey that Valerie was the woman in cell IV? Why wasn't Evey naked in the rain? Why didn't Evey ask if V was her father? Why did't Finch do LSD? Why wasn't Finch the person that shot V? Why didn't Evey assume the mask (and in after that raise Dominic as the next V)? There are a lot of other ""whys"" but these are ones that could have at least been included in the film as it stands that would have made the fans of the source material a little happier.<br/><br/>For me the film failed every time it got too far from the source material. It was also missing two key characters- that of Rosemary Almond and Helen Hayer. There was a couple of times that the new envisioning worked- Stephen Fry's brilliant Gordon Dietrich and V in a kitchen apron for instance. But a lot of time it didn't (Dascombe surviving in the TV tower). It also failed in representing NorseFire as a totalitarian fascist dictatorship. And where did the slagging of America come from? That wasn't in the book.<br/><br/>The film is not entirely bad- When it hits the source material (Bishop Lillimans take-down, Surrage's execution, Valerie) it is powerful and evocative; Valerie for me was especially hard hitting and I am not ashamed to say that I shed a few tears during the sequence- And even Storm Saxon got a nod. But at the end of the day I think the Wakoffsky brothers missed the mark. I will even go as far as say that I don't think they understood the source or didn't have the balls to bring the real thing to screen.<br/><br/>I do agree that Alan Moore was right to remove his name from this movie- Hopefully sometime in the future proper justice will be done to this story. England Prevails.<br/><br/>Andrew ""I know every inch of this cell and it knows every inch of me. Except one"""
"wizard42","9","3","6","24 March 2006"," Great acting
","Well, this movie was far better then I thought it would be. Having not liked the Matrix trilogy I went into this movie thinking that I would at best find it a good action flick. I was very surprised by the film. It helped that the Wachowski's did not direct it, as they aren't very good with actors. Hugo Weaving gives a brilliant nuanced performance behind a non-moving plastic mask. Limited to only his voice, and body movements to express the thoughts and feelings of his character, he allows us to see the tortured soul that is the protagonist of the story. We feel his pain, his love, and his sadness, all without seeing his face. This truly is an Oscar worthy performance, although I doubt he'll even be nominated given the type of movie this is, and when it has been released. Natalie Portman is equally strong. I always knew she was a good actress, despite the Star Wars trilogy where her performance varied mostly because of horrible directing and an uneven script. But given a good script and a meaty role she shines, and this movie is not exception. The vulnerability of her character, and her struggle to overcome her fear, and be truly free, is portrayed with remarkable skill. The rest of the cast is solid, with Stephen Rea giving a particularly good performance. The only problem is there is no depth to the villainous Chancellor, or for that matter in any of the bad guys. While we get a deep understanding of the protagonists, we only get a superficial rendering of the villains. The cinematography, is gorgeous, with some great stunt and special effects work. The movie moves along at a good clip, and I was surprised at how long it was, it did not seem like I had been in the theater for two and a half hours. This must be attributed to the directing, and editing, which keep the movie humming along, with no real slow moments. Yes, there is the requisite comic book violence, and you must suspend disbelief fairly often, but the movie is truly worth the time and lots of fun. As noted, I was surprised at just how good a film this is, and it is the actors along with very good directing that makes this film so good."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","9","3","6","24 March 2006"," Is terror ever a justifiable tactic to use? And if so... what does it take for it to become that?
","I was fortunate enough to watch this on the opening night. Having returned from the cinema, just a few hours after it ended, and with the movie still fresh in my mind, I write this review. My main interest in the film was and remains that the graphic novel upon which it is based was written by Alan Moore, arguably one of the best comic writers and without a shadow of doubt one of my favorites. Allow me to address the fellow fans for a moment; a lot of the story is intact(if the conflict is shifted, with measurable loss of effect, to the current political climate, rather than Moore's original, anarchy versus government), though some is changed around to being more visual(even though it does have images, the original comic book is still that... a book. Words can convey more depth than moving visuals with few exceptions, and the transition from one medium to another, it is pointless to deny, requires some changes). However, several images are recreated to the very last detail(something I haven't seen the likes of which since Sin City, which used the comic as storyboards, something I suspect may have also been the case here, at least to a certain extent. I recognized so much. Some subplots and such are cut for length and pacing, but they did fair in keeping all that they could without it being difficult to keep track of for new viewers(I watched it with three people who had never seen a single frame of the comic, and each of them 'got it', and enjoyed it, just as I... one asked where he could get the comic itself). And I'm very happy to tell you that the famous torture sequence hasn't been removed; if my memory of the comic serves me right... is hasn't even been trimmed. The first trailer told me this, and ever since I saw it, I've been eagerly anticipating its premiere, and I don't regret hyping myself up for watching it in the least. Albeit, that trailer(and the following one, even more-so) also claimed that the film was action-packed... something one of my fellow viewers accepted as true, and expected. He didn't leave disappointed, though, merely surprised. Know, dear potential viewer and reader of this review, that this is not an 'action' film/flick... don't go to see this expecting constant fight scenes. If you watched The Matrix and all you saw were the fight scenes... don't watch this. There's considerably less action. What there is, however, is rather remarkable... it's clear that these are the people behind aforementioned film, and it's clear that they read and dig the comic, and comics in general. The visuals are breathtaking. I don't remember when I was last gripped by a film like I was by this one. The direction is quite good, although there are points where you can tell that the man in the chair has not sat there before, as well as the fact that he had strong guidance from the Wachowski brothers. The plot is excellent. The pacing is near perfect. The acting was flawless. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The film is very involving and intense, it pulls you in and doesn't let go until the credits roll. It's very stylish and cool. The film relies greatly on dialog(which also means that most of the humor is verbal, British... marvelous choice, if I do say so myself), much like the novel... although some things are obviously more visual than the source material. The Voice of London gets a face and V's fights get easier on the eyes(and obviously, the explosions are very much there). What I really enjoyed, while watching this movie, was that it was hardly toned down... it was almost all there. The perverseness, the 'different' human beings, and, most importantly, the message. The moral. The question that is asked, that we must consider: Is terror ever a justifiable tactic to use? And if so... what does it take for it to become that? I recommend this great piece of cinema to anyone who is willing to open their minds to the themes within(though the book contains more), and especially fans of Alan Moore, the Wachowskies and/or comic books. 9/10"

I purchased the novel, thinking that the movie was lacking in back story. That there was more than meets the eye, as they say. Once I learned that the Wachowski Brothers were great fans of the graphic novel, I found my self questioning the artistic license they took with the plot. Though I am not personally a die hard for comics, I felt a little put off by the different conclusions of the two mediums. For those of you who haven't read the novel, I highly suggest picking it up. It's a good read, but also a fast one. I finished it in less than a few hours, so you need not worry that it would be something that would occupy your time."

If your going to see a movie for entertainment, which most do, then i highly recommend this. However, i went to see it to write a movie review on it for the paper. Since i have to critique it in the paper. ill give a little of my opinion on here. It was a great movie as a movie (visual effects, special effects) but the theme was a little twisted, and in the end kind of ended up promoting sympathy for terrorism. I thought that the way things are today, this movies was a little risqué.

","this movie is a must see. i was so anxious to see it after the impressive previews, but i was so unprepared for the actual experience.<br/><br/>i could EASILY go on and on about the superb twists and intricacies in the plot, but i think its best to see the movie to fully appreciate the power of this film. i was concerned, that this would turn out to be another comic book action movie, with cheap thrills (as much as i love em) and action packed scenes with little story line.<br/><br/>was i impressed.<br/><br/>the thing which really sets this film apart from the rest of its genre is the casting. i cannot remember ever being so immersed in individual characters, and Vendetta has plenty. V was cast perfectly, i was utterly enchanted and charmed, but at the same time frightened and horrified by his hate and twisted morals, i simply couldn't help but be drawn in by such a character. Hugo Weaving did a masterful portrayal of a deep emotional character, without ever taking the mask off. it was his presence and magnificent mastering of speech that made V such a charismatic and powerful character.<br/><br/>Natalie portman was magnificent, John Hurt masterful in his delivery, as well as Stephen Rea who tied the whole thing together.<br/><br/>the music score was powerful and moving, amplifying and exaggerating some of the most crucial scenes in such a way it had the hairs on my neck standing on end.<br/><br/>this movie had the potential to be a good action comic movie adaptation, but in reality achieved so much more.<br/><br/>the plot is not far fetched, is in fact running in parallel with a lot of recent events, and so convincing in its delivery that this film is a powerful statement of just where the world seems to be going.<br/><br/>one of the best movies i have seen for years, visually stunning, expertly directed and produced, powerful and flawless in the skills of its actors- the last scenes will take your breath away and have anyone British asking themselves if they would have been standing there with a mask too.<br/><br/>not art, just magnificent."

","See the movie before you check its rating on the IMDb.com. You might get disappointed, otherwise. It's definitely a bit too high for my liking. Not that the movie is bad. On the contrary it's probably in the same vicinity with Sin City, although the latter is better, I believe.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is great in it and as for Hugo Weaving, it's probably for the best we never get to see his face. Otherwise we would think that Agent Smith had won after all. And don't tell me that V for Vendetta has nothing to do with George Orwell's 1984. A Totalitarian government that controls all means of communication, rewrites history and so on. Well yeah, unlike in 1984 in V for Vendetta a way out exists.<br/><br/>Well many people will probably find this an anti-Bush movie. And to some extent they might be right. Some will go to the extreme and dub it a pro-terrorist movie, which is a complete, unsubstantiated and utter b***s***, thank you very much. I really cannot understand articles like the one in the NY Sun about the controversy of the film and how somebody can make a film with a terrorist as a protagonist after Sept.11. Actually there is one way and that's if you see the government described in V for Vendetta somewhat comparable to that of the United States.<br/><br/>And one final thing, if I ever just but hear a rumor of V for Vendetta 2, I would never go to see another Wachowski brother's movie again. I hope they know how they f***ed up with the Matrix 2 and 3 and that they owe me (and you also probably) the 20 dollars that I paid for the tickets."

","The film is set in a fascist England of the future. You can't forget that the characters are English, because the keep saying b******s all the time. As I grew up in London I found this quite amusing as we just don't speak like that. I guess that is what the future brings. Natalie Portman gives a lukewarm performance, but Hugo Weaving is excellent especially considering he is behind an expressionless mask - it really was a mask not a Keano Reaves impression! While well crafted and well acted, this film is not ground breaking entertainment. The special effects are good, although when the action comes it is a bit bloody. The idea of Guy Fawkes as anarchistic is amusing although totally inaccurate. I am sure many will like this film more than I did, so don't let me put you off, but for me it was like champagne with no sparkle."
"james_norman1981","9","3","6","22 March 2006"," The best movie out this year?
","And so we come to the Wachowskis' first non-Matrix project since Bound and one can't help thinking that they could've picked a concept a little further away from their established territory. V for Vendetta represents a radical lack of change in direction for the brothers but, when they're on this sort of form, one can forgive them for treading familiar paths. Of course, this is not to say that Andy and Larry are purely responsible for V for Vendetta, credit must go to James McTeigue, whose first sortie into direction, albeit heavily under the influence of the Wachowskis, shows an excellent grasp of his craft.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta, henceforth just V, is an astonishingly stylish film, bringing together all the darkness and rich, vibrant colour one would expect from a graphic novel adaptation and linking the images with, mostly, a fitting and enjoyable innovative cinematography. At no point are you left thinking 'This is much more than a comic book adaptation,' but when the images are this good you don't really care. However, you cannot live on style alone and McTeigue, with his two parental peers overseeing him, delivers on the heart aspect of V well. By focusing on Natalie Portman's Evey we get a human perspective of the dystopic world of an English fascist future. To Evey V is initially every bit as intimidating as the government that oppresses her and killed her family. Her fear of V and her desire to be normal again are both realistic and sympathetic, the latter being much harder to show without turning the audience against Evey. However, this trick is performed with real skill and little obviousness about it so that we don't hate her for her wish to be free of V.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, where the film doesn't work is equally clear. Portman's accent, as has been widely reported, is awful and must be chalked up as a clear negative. It would've practically been better, although anathema to purist readers of the original source material, to have Evey be an American living in London rather than endure Portman's mockney twittering, which is every bit as irksome as Dick Van Dyke or Don Cheadle in Mary Poppins and Oceans 11/12 respectively.<br/><br/>Why then not simply have cast someone else in the role? Well the answer to that is also simple: Portman is fantastic as Evey, imbuing her with a full range of emotions as her character endures everything from torture to love during the roller-coaster ride she inadvertently joins. The accent aside, Portman's Evey almost drips with sincerity and heart, two qualities without which, as I've mentioned, the film would have failed drastically.<br/><br/>And what of Hugo? Well Agent Smith is on well trodden ground with this film. Covered up throughout by an expressionless mask, Weaving does his best to instill V with a character and mostly does well, creating the mixture of great strength and intense vulnerability that all superheroes, which V is albeit in the antiheroic Batman style, must have to appeal to an audience who are instinctively jealous and distrustful of their powers. Weaving does what is required to the best of his abilities and pulls off the impressive coup of making us emote with someone who is, effectively, little more than a robot whose moral outrage has enforced his descent into supposedly terrorist activities.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is both great fun and thought provoking, rather like the original Matrix film. It's portrayal of a future where the merging of a totalitarian government with a pliant media keeps the entire population under control is extremely pertinent to today's climate of fear the likes of George Bush and Tony Blair are trying to create, backed up by the people in charge of corporations, which are also represented in V as the main beneficiaries when human populations are afraid and therefore consume more. You could write, or read, books on how prevalent this attitude is at the moment and it is nice to see a Hollywood blockbuster so openly tackle the subject, though it does so with half an eye on the stopwatch... <br/><br/>...Which is why the film works so well. Andy and Larry may have blundered hugely with the Matrix sequels but here they have constrained themselves and, although V is a long movie, it never feels slow. Similarly for a modern action flick there is a surprising dearth of slow motion fight scenes. Yet, despite this, you never feel yourself losing interest or itching to press some sort of cinematic fast forward button, thanks to the chemistry and sincerity of all involved and, equally importantly, the way the film pans out. The pacing is generally excellent and the tension, when it comes, is all the more powerful because of the holding back on the CG, special effects and violence. V's final battle, for example, would never have worked emotionally if he'd spent the whole film doing equally, or more, impressive things. Instead we have a payoff that, like the final scenes of the original Matrix, is utterly engrossing and highly emotive.<br/><br/>Beyond that there's not much to say. There are problems beyond Portman's accent V's wordiness jars the nerves a little and the lack of an expression on our antihero becomes frustrating too. At over two hours the movie is a little overlong and the final conclusion perhaps a little too pat. However, these issues are relatively minor and often forgotten when the next scene swings by. The excellent Stephen Rea deserves much credit here for the way he takes an explanatory character (someone simply present to explain/'discover' V's motives) and makes a real person out of him. Most of the other support is top notch too.<br/><br/>Therefore I strongly urge you to see this film and, hopefully, enjoy it as much as I have. To those of you out that who might hesitate, after the Matrices Reloaded and Revolutions, take heart the Wachowski's are back on form."

Everyone is uniquely and perfectly picked for their roles.<br/><br/>The visual and action elements of the movie are done nicely however they are rather in the background not drawing away too much of the attention from the actors and the story itself.

","Well I knew the movie would not be the same as the comic book. I am sure even Alan Moore and David Lloyd would have made changes having as many years of perspective as they have on the comic. I think by bringing in different writers much of the plot lost its deeper meaning and irony. I think some of the content of the comic making it worthy of being made into a movie was completely left out. Instead content was once again filled with action scenes and special effects. Also some of the non British actors could have used a little more practice on their accents. Overall it was a good movie with good acting but I think the ending didn't stay true to the comic."

","""V for Vendetta"" is an utterly remarkable piece of film. It tells the story of a young woman, ""Evey"" (Portman), and her journey from being and imprisoned citizen of futuristic England to being a freedom fighter. Her parents were freedom fighters and were killed when she was very young. In a chance encounter one night with some ""finger men"" (England's brutal police force), she is rescued by the vigilant ""V"", only to watch him in his first terrorist attack on corrupt England. Video surveillance shows her at the scene of the crime, and shortly thereafter she is wanted for arrest. In his second act of terrorism, ""V"" shows up at Evey's job, where she subsequently saves him from a policeman, after which she is knocked unconscious. Then and there ""V"" makes the decision to take her with him, and so begins her life altering course. She becomes unafraid, unwaivering, and under the spell of the valiant ""V"". The story plays out, and I'll leave the rest for you to see at the movies. ""V for Vendetta"" is grasping from beginning to end. It is a rather long movie, but not once in the whole film is there a time when the movie-goer thinks, ""I wish this would just end already."" It literally keeps you locked from beginning to end. I would recommend it to anyone, and would consider going to see it for a second time myself."

","The more I think about this movie, the more I like it. Yeah, it's hard to watch some of the actions in this movie, mainly because all the horrendous ones are not done by the obvious villains. V's agenda is disturbing, but more importantly, it can cause us to ask ourselves why it disturbs us. This is not a simple good vs. evil movie. We never see V's face, but Evy says, in effect, that he is all of us. There is always a part of us that will eventually destroy our rulers to regain our freedom. And yet, will we always let it come to that point? The point where the only way out is violent destruction. Are there any real innocents in this scenario? You can spot a few in this movie -- before they die. These are the kinds of significant questions this movie can cause us to ponder -- if you go beneath the surface and look for the ideas.

","Now maybe my harsh feelings stem from the fact that I am a fan of the Graphic Novel. I will be the first to state that my appreciation for the source material may cloud my judgment of the film. However I have tired to stay objective. I went in hearing only good things, and my only wish was for it not to suck. Despite everything, I came out disappointed. This isn't just me picking on changes to the comic. Cinema is a different art form, thus adaptation is necessary, and essential to the experience. Still I can't help feeling that this movie is simply.... watered down.<br/><br/>************SPOILER'S AHEAD****************** I have to agree with nineissix, everything I loved about the comic is gone. Gone is the Vicious Cabaret. Gone is the emotion and depth of the story. I've heard people stating that the plot is complicated and deep. Yes it is, but it is deeply spoon feed to the audience and is nothing more than exposition to further the plot. There is no sense of mystery to this movie. The story doesn't gradually unfold; it just hits you over the head like a hammer until its done. I feel all the characters were gravely disserviced. Evey is (despite Portman's efforts) is still not there on the page to be a fully developed character. The ""torture sequence,"" one of the most powerful segments of the novel (and one of the most faithfully rendered in the film) doesn't have half the impact it should have because Evey really isn't there. And we don't see much of her imprisonment to make it feel worse. I mean what happens really? Shaved head, verbally abused, (I believe she is beaten) but for some reason it doesn't have the gravitas it should. Instead we have a montage until she is free. And the toilet paper note (a point that nearly broke my heart in book) is delegated to the cheesiest flashbacks I've seen in recent cinema. Honestly! I'm glad that in the future ARRI light equipment will be around to help shoot movies.<br/><br/>And let us talk about V. I feel that Weaving (like all the actors) did a fantastic job with what they had. Hugo sold the mask and the presence. But honestly they lost some of his mystique. The first vision of V rescuing Evey is so poorly handled as far a fight sequence goes, that it's beyond words. You have no sense of what he's doing (and not in the Batman Begins, whoaican'ttellwhatbatman'sdoingbut he'stotallymoppingthefloorwiththoseguys badass type way). And his first monologue is simply laughable.<br/><br/>And maybe that's my problem. Too much of the movie is laughable, and that's the last thing the comic was. It was dark and intelligent, filled anarchy and fear and mystery that hung over the whole piece and I don't feel that tone in this film. V serving eggs is goofy. End of story.<br/><br/>Did anyone else find the music horrid? What was that crap playing on the jukebox before their dance? Where's the classical music? I found the score overbearing and the source music oddly out of place. The song that was playing over the end credits cements that point. How do you not end with the 1812 overture? You're already playing it! I heard Alan Moore bashed the screenplay. I don't blame him. Nothing is worse than something that should have been good. The filmmaker's hearts were in the right place, but their execution is something left to be desired. They got the aesthetic, but not the soul.<br/><br/>Sorry Alan, it was better than League of Extraordinary gentleman, but that isn't saying much."
"praxis22","8","3","6","19 March 2006"," It's good but it's not the book
","It's gets very close to a re-creation of the book, as close as Hollywood is ever going to get, and I suppose I'll just have to be happy with that.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, even on it's own merits. I could do without the wishy-washy political allegory of the final scene, but this is Hollywood, you need a big cinematic finale. The crowd goes wild, cheerleaders all come out for smooches! Blah.<br/><br/>I think far more could be made of the fact that the government made V what he is, the book is more explicit about that too. I would also have liked it, had they not replaced V's TV spot with the ""something is wrong with this country"" stuff. I would have preferred the original from the book, especially the subversive aspect of the kid writing obscenities under a surveillance camera that's been switched off. But I'm guessing that you can only safely blow up despised symbols in Hollywood. Anything else, these days, especially something that looks like a tower is just too close for comfort.<br/><br/>Do you think I've made my 10 line now?<br/><br/>It's a decent movie, go see it."
"Deusvolt","8","3","6","19 March 2006"," A hero/anti-hero is out to avenge himself and society against a criminal government.
","I see in V influences of Zorro (the bladed weapons and the costume), Phantom of the Opera (the disfigured face and the mask), Captain America and his nemesis the Red Skull (both products of genetic engineering gone awry), Robin Hood (who robs the villains), The Silent Knight (who, however, unlike V, wasn't loquacious), the comic version of Spiderman (more because of the verbosity than the agility), Alan Ladd's The Black Knight (his chaste devotion to a lady love), Cyrano d'Bergerac (use of the rapier and the look of that Guy Fawkes mask), the beast in the TV series Beauty and the Beast (the elegant prose), and a host of other characters whether masked, disfigured or not.<br/><br/>The storyline is of course similar to those of 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. The wonderful difference is that unlike in 1984 where the hero physically survives but loses his freedom of mind, in V for Vendetta, (spoiler ahead), V vicariously survives his death through the many people who take up his challenge to set themselves free by virtually assuming his identity. In Fahrenheit 451, the heroes are really the books which survive through people with the main character taking the identity of a particular book by memorizing it. In V's case, he becomes an idea that survives in the hearts and minds of people. For further comparisons, watch Brazil, another Fahrenheit take-off, which in spite of its inspiring visual effects is quite a ""downer.""<br/><br/>The above having been said, there is no quibbling over the fact that it is a riveting movie. The speeches, repartee and even the obiter dicta which continuously spew from the main character are certainly worth listening to and remembering. I was struck by that quote in Latin on his antique mirror (Vi Veri Veniversum Vivus Vici)which comes from Christopher Marlowe's play The Tragical History of Dr. Faustus based on a German folk tale. Production value is great. <br/><br/>The topic is both current and everlasting : how people in general respond to cleverly manipulative, brutal and tyrannical governments -- initially with timid obeisance until inspired by a few or even one brave person.<br/><br/>This writer should know as he participated in the glorious People Power Revolution of the Philippines, a country under the grip of a rightist and criminal dictatorship for 14 years. Until, one person told us that we couldn't ""allow ourselves to be paralyzed by fear"" and that ""courage is contagious"" made us march in the millions with nothing but flowers and rosaries to topple the Dictatorship. <br/><br/>What intrigues me was V's use of the Guy Fawkes mask and why he derives his inspiration for his revolt from the Gunpowder Plot. Was he a Catholic? Are his creators (Alan Moore and David Lloyd)? The Gunpowder Plotters were disenfranchised Catholics who couldn't bear the repression of their right to worship in the Old Faith. Their churches were confiscated by the monarch and given over to the Church of England while parliament passed laws stripping English Catholics of much of their rights, excluding them from much of public employment and restricting their ownership of property.<br/><br/>The film of course takes deep digs at the proponents of ""The War on Terror"" who use the problem of terrorism to promote their rightist agenda and for their and their friends' power and economic aggrandizement."

The film does the same job.<br/><br/>Given the complexity of the storyline certainly some other story lines have been omitted but it really makes no difference to the overall story.<br/><br/>If you didn't like the move from action to words in Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions you probably won't like this either. The W brothers are delivering an important message. You're going to have to think and you're going to have to pay attention. <br/><br/>I imagine the people who don't like it simply don't 'get it'. I've seen reviews that say the mask gets in the way of V's humanity - that just seems like a stupid statement on a thousand different levels.<br/><br/>I'm British and I had no problems with Natalie Portman's accent.<br/><br/>Remember, remember:<br/><br/>The nature of the story means that many reviews and reviewers are going to attack its basic premise. This is too important a story and too different a film for people to rely on other people's views. Your first act of awakening should be to see this film and JUDGE FOR YOURSELF; wake up world - make your own informed decisions instead of relying on that of others - lest we end up with the world that V inhabits."

","We loved it!. Not only was it just a well told story. As per the norm, the W Bros. have layered this so deep with implication and social commentary, there is a real point underlying it all. On the surface, it could be an action flick, dig deeper and it seems to forecast possible outcomes for mans current path, based on history repeating it's self. Deeper yet and I thought they made some interesting oblique criticisms of the current U.S. administration...The acting was, in my opinion, great, characters well developed, and story line nothing short of outstanding...This is one of those movies three friends could go to, and those same three would leave with three completely different meanings/experience depending on how deep they got into the details."
"janetgoodman","8","3","6","19 March 2006"," Impressions of V (Some vague spoilers)
","Impressions of V:<br/><br/>Those who have never read the book, nor know of its quality, will come away with the impression of a somewhat controversial film - touching on the political, thought provoking...with a few moments of true poignancy. Also, they'll remember a few good action sequences. For that, I'm glad. V the film has its good qualities, and will get some of the message of the book into the public eye, and discourse.<br/><br/>But any true review of this film is for those who know, and love, the graphic novel.<br/><br/>Honestly, I expected the Wachowski Brothers to make a bigger hash of the film than they did. They actually managed to retain some of the philosophy, and some of V's original integrity. And Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving both did right by the film...thanks to V for Vendetta, Portman shows that she can still act, despite the Star Wars movies. But Moore was right to insist that his name be removed from the film.<br/><br/>Liberties were taken with the story - sadly, none of them were necessary. Evey's age and her career are altered. The Voice of Fate ends differently, and whole characters are removed - damaging the depth of the story. Almond and Rose no longer exist, Evie's relationship with Gordon is changed completely...even the character of the leader is dramatically altered, making him more of a cartoon right wing villain. A subtle romantic thread is implied between V and Evey - removing completely Evie's hope that V might be her father. Sadly, each omission/change appears gratiutious - done for no particular reason, adding nothing to the story (and taking away levels of depth.)<br/><br/>Is it still a valuable film? I'm happy to say that the unchanged scenes are worth the viewing, especially Valeries story, which was told word for word. But while V for Vendetta is not the Hollywood nightmare that some fans might have feared, it could have been even better. The integrity could - and should - have been kept intact. > Fortunately, ideas are bulletproof. So if you see the film, and respond to the philosophy behind it, then do yourself a favor, and read the original. If this film brings people to read Moore's classic work, then it will have been worthwhile."
"fatars","4","3","6","19 March 2006"," it was alright
","I have read this graphic novel and the movie pretty much kept to the book. The story and its message are above and beyond amazing and powerful however i felt this movie just wasn't shot well. It was a great story no doubt, but there was way too much talking and not enough motion to guide the story through. The music was beyond irritating and sometimes i couldn't even hear V speaking because the music was drowning his voice out. This graphic novel does indeed have a lot of text passages but i feel in a movie, there has to be more action than dialogue. Its more of a practicality issue than anything else, because ppl get bored seeing ppl talk instead of doing something. I also did not find the state of England to be this dark, depressing state. The director made it all bright and colorful, and generally people seemed happy, yet everyone is all talking about how there is no freedom. Natalie Portman did a really good job acting in the prison scenes, however i felt in the beginning of the movie that she wasn't scared/timid enough. I liked this movie, but i really really wish it was made better. It really could have been a mind-blowing movie. I also wish that this movie had darker visuals/atmosphere and a sort of Orwellian atmosphere. (For a good example of totalitarian atmosphere look at the movie Brazil). I wish the music wasn't playing every second of the film and I wish they added some action or something that guided us through the talking scenes. Listening to those characters speak can sometimes be very tiring. I wish NP acted more timid in the beginning as well. But that's about it. I give this movie a solid B. (great acting though, loved the ending, prison sequence and the LarkHill sequence as well)"

","V for Vendetta, seems an awful like the way things could happen, no? The symbolism is wonderful and so deep in so many ways. My wife did not enjoy it and actually seemed a little upset by it. I told my wife going in that it would be very similar to Batman Begins, which she was a fan of. She wasn't a fan of the violence which I thought was actually in decent taste and not overdone, which they could have easily done. The others that we went with all want to see it again. (Me included) I thought it was brilliant and was what I expected the last two Matrix movies to be. I know Alan Moore doesn't like the translation to film, but then nobody really ever likes someone else's version of their ideas. I think the Wachowski brothers really made up for those movies and have impressed lil' ol' me. The tone of the film really captures your attention. Definitely a film that is better on the big screen. I hope my comments help anyone that is unsure about seeing the movie. It really is an outstanding movie."

","I was hesitant seeing this as I knew the Wachowski brothers were involved. I absolutely detested the Matrix sequels. Thankfully, they were not behind the camera on this one. And while they are given writing credits, they were working with such a strong story that I wonder if the real credit shouldn't be given to the director (who unfortunately is being lost in the 'film by the Wachowski brothers' media hype). But I digress.<br/><br/>The film is simply amazing. One of the most intellectual films I have seen in a very long time. I believe if you really follow what is being said on screen, then this is a very challenging film. The acting was brilliant, cinematography, directing, etc.<br/><br/>I am also surprised that a film like this - that essentially to me glorifies (or at least justifies) terrorism was released in today's political climate. while the base story is essentially British in nature, the parallels to America today are eerily close.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant film and needs to be seen. Normally this would be produced by an Indie firm, so my hats off to Warner Brothers for having the courage to release such a daring and thought-provoking film! It's movies like this that make me think about going to the movie theaters again."

","This is probably one of the better movies I have seen in a long while. The cast was brilliant, Portman and Weaving set the stage for an excellent performance, with in-depth plot and definition of characters, and settings. Very historic-esk as well, the situation at hand relating partially to Nazi Germany in World War 2, while applying to modern terms as well, by means of governmental issues. Parts were very well constructed, causing me to move to unexpected emotions. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie. It is at least worth the 8 dollars or so you will be charged, and if not, then the 3 bucks for rental when it comes out. The Wachowski brothers have done it again."
"ironman_bluesteel","8","3","6","18 March 2006"," Unique enough to talk about for hours after
","My wife and I have been very picky when it comes to the theater of late. That said, we weren't sure what we were going to see (it was a coin toss between Libertine and V) even as we were on the way to there. V for Vendetta went above our expectations to deliver a story familiar enough to be exciting, but with a uniqueness that kept the show interesting. In fact, I enjoyed the similarity of some elements with Batman Begins and Casshern. I was even more surprised by the fact that with all the formula for Hollywood action films so ubiquitous in recent movies, V for Vendetta actually had something new for me - a strong cast of characters who can act, intellectual dialogue, history and drama, not to mention worthy political theoreticizing. V's main point is not action sequences, which I recall only at the beginning and the end of the film. What you'll get from your ticket price is a decent movie and plenty of discussion about it afterwards with whomever you see it with - something I've been wanting from Hollywood for a long time."
"rafiqs","8","3","6","18 March 2006"," V is not just a mask, its an idea!
","I always thought that this movie is going to be kind of sci-fi action packed yet another Wachowaski brother's matrix type of flick. But got to tell you this was amazing piece of work. From the beginning till the end I was on the edge of the seat. From the first scene when V got introduced, it was like who and why is he ""V""? <br/><br/>Finally when I got out of the theater,I was debating myself, how much is there beyond our personal life which is untouched and unknown! Although the movie seems to have set in future and sounds fictional, the incidents and the political situation always represents today's world. And most of the countries are going through these facts. <br/><br/>The movie not only shows how the government uses their own public to experiment on drugs, religion and anti-homosexuality, it also shows how a individual can contribute to fight against the prevailing system. It tells us that it's only the ""fear"", that kills our system. The ending is what is very inspiring. The most moving dialogue was when V says ""beneath this mask there is more than flesh. There is an idea, Mr. Creedy, and ideas are bulletproof""<br/><br/>As the movie moves on you get involved with V character so much, that you start believing his preach, and somehow you find him a hero of your world too. Basically in the movie it is ""Evey"" who is represented as getting inspired by V showing different life situations, but finally ""Evey"" is just a character and that could be anyone as you :)<br/><br/>Hugo, who has acted as V is amazing. He seems creepy with the mask, but the acting and the voice which reflects the movie sequences is very impressive. Natalie Portman is as usual fantastic. As ""Evey"" character she couldn't be more justifiable! Her looks and expressions are well portrayed. And even the rest of the cast in the movie is well acted.<br/><br/>And last but not least to mention are action scenes. Wow! They were just visual treat to eyes.<br/><br/>This is a must see movie. This movie not just represents Natalie Portman, it could be me, my family or friends or you!"
"AnonymousTJ9806","10","3","6","18 March 2006"," One Of The Best So Far
","After 2005's discontinued success with big,clunky action movies, I was afraid for V for Vendetta, The Wachowski Brothers bundle of love. Yet, I was fortunate to watch the movie yesterday, and this is a first, but it is the first SMART action/adventure movie and for that reason, this movie in itself is a revolution in a revolution.<br/><br/>The movie brilliantly opens with Natalie Portman's exuberant and calming voice of the tragic poem that is of Guy Fawkes, a man who tried to blow up Parliament and was eventually executed. Throughout the movie, the first lines of ""Remember, Remember, the fifth of November,"" rambled in my head. The movie creates a world in where America has gone communist and apparently, is in the open fire of a civil war. Britain has become a totalitarian state with a vicious chancellor by the name of Sutler (Played notoriously by John Hurt). The world has been protected from wars and viruses and such for some time, as the government makes sure the people are put in their houses at a curfew and do not do anything drastic. Enter Evey Hammond, who meets V, a terrorist with the mask of Guy Fawkes on throughout the movie.<br/><br/>V's performance is one of the most tragic, comedic and substantial roles I've seen in the past decade, and he's under a mask. The mask is one of the most prolific symbols in the film, as even though Hugo Weaving is speaking, the mask moves with his words. It's smiling at a comedic moment, it's grimacing while he is thinking and it is hiding the facade of emotions that is V when he is emotional. Weaving's mask work is one of the best and should be noted as a high point for me in the film.<br/><br/>The movie creates a world that we've thought to have been dead. Any movie that is able to create a controversy WITHIN the film always receives top honors, and the movie does just that. The criticism it has received for it's political references are so irrelevant to this film that it's near funny as hell. The Wachowski's have decided to mock reviewers in their attempts to find some parallel with politics of today, as every movie in 2005 tried to do just that. V For Vendetta is the most symbolic movie I've seen in the new millennium, bringing up topics we are too afraid to watch. Evey and V's romance though, is something the Wachowski's to have wanted to be fronted in the movie.<br/><br/>There are no flaws with the movie, except maybe the ambition meter was pushed a little too far. But then again, ""it is the only thing celluloid has to offer"", as V says.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","What would have happened if Frank Capra came to maturity as a member of Generation X, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington would have been called V for Vendetta.<br/><br/>I will admit, before seeing this movie I didn't know anything about the story beyond the trailers (I hadn't read the comic books or anything). So take my words from that perspective.<br/><br/>That being said I thought this was a GREAT movie, one of the best I have seen in a long while. The story was unique, and the acting excellent. There wasn't much call for special effects but what little there were was interesting (A take off on the Matrix bullets, but then both V and the Matrix were directed by the same people).<br/><br/>I was quite astounded by Hugo Weaving's performance. Having experienced him in the Lord of the Rings and in the Matrix, watching him act you do not realize the power of his voice alone. Weaving has gone up in my estimations as an actor.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman, whom I only know from Star Wars fame does a fantastic job and proves that she is not just a one role wonder. Her character goes through a huge evolution and her acting chops are right there with her.<br/><br/>I wish I could go on more but I know there is a limit to this comment section and so I will end simply with this. Go see it and I hope you will see what I am saying. Not every movie is an Oscar winner but that doesn't mean it doesn't have merit.<br/><br/>REMEMBER REMEMBER THE FIFTH OF November!"

It is a little corny in places, but it should definitely raise a few questions about our society. Not only is this movie thought provoking, it is well written, and has some great special effects. The acting is good too. This is not one of those run of the mill movies that try to deal with a serious subject, but turns out to be poor. This has One thing that I like in every movie, is that the good guy ultimately wins. V was always one step ahead of the bad guys in this movie.

All I can say about this movie is WOW! Now I went into the theater expecting a good movie but I was expecting something this good. Hugo Weaving (V) really comes across as a bad-ass rebel in this movie. Natalie Portman (Evey) is great once again, this time portraying an innocent, scared girl who eventually comes face to face with her fears. John Hurt (Sutler) really makes you believe that he actually is a dictator in real life, he is that good. The acting overall in V4V is sensational.<br/><br/>The acting isn't the only good thing in this movie, the action is phenomenal. It will keep your interest for the entire 133 minute duration of the film.<br/><br/>The story is excellent. It is hard to come across one as good as V4V nowadays. About a very dark, grim look into the future where government rules absolutely everything and everyone is at its mercy. But there is one who fights, our beloved V. Thus creating the ever, enticing story.<br/><br/>So, all in all, I STRONGLY recommend you see V For Vendetta. It is the best movie I've seen in a long while, and the best movie I've seen so far in 2006."

","I really enjoyed this film from start to finish. I just thought the film flowed really nicely for the two or more hours it was shown and never got boring. The theme of the movie all centred around 5th November (guy Fawkes night) and some psycho man who wore a mask for the entire film whose aim was to kill certain individuals and destroy Parliament.<br/><br/>So with that being the background- Things I enjoyed- The acting of Natalie Portman (Evey Hammond) and Hugo Weaving (V) is excellent, both of them give really dramatic and outstandingly frightening performances for the genre of the film. There was a lot of moments which made you jump and get a fright and a lot of tension, atmosphere and suspension was create in certain moments through certain elements. I really enjoyed this and hope everyone else does too.<br/><br/>All in all, not the best film I have seen, but a truly great, action packed, thriller with great characters and a futuristic look of England and terrorism. It was brilliant. An 8!!!"
"greek2thebone","6","3","6","16 March 2006"," Decent, but not as good as heralded
","V for Vendetta is an interesting movie in the sense that it features both superhero blockbuster action, as well as a political message. The political message is not subtle: it warns of the dangers of power abuse resulting from people's political indifference. Sadly, the hero's path to political action is one of violence and rebellion. The parallels between current American policies in the name of ""freedom"" and ""righteousness"" and the totalitarian British state are remarkable. The scenes greatly remind me of Michael Radford's 1984, especially the prison and torture scenes. The use of humour attempts to make the movie lighter and it does, but I find it to be unnecessary and resulting to occasionally stupid and out of place dialogue. The superhero part of the movie is not much better even though the director puts a valiant effort to develop the hero's character. Alas, V is no Batman but he definitely has a more romantic and intellectual air to it. An overall good effort which could be much better if the production was more serious. Natalie Portman performs remarkably but her script could be better; when dressed as a school girl (admittedly a provocatively pleasant sight) everyone in the cinema erupted in laughter which showed how flawed the movie was. My rating, a critical 6."

I believe now that bloody terror can be a legitimate method for expressing your dissatisfaction. I believe that one anonymous individual does have his right to decide for the entire nation. I believe that a procession of uniformed crowds wearing masks may not actually be a Ku Klux Klan parade but a heroic movement of revolutionary patriots. I believe that you can fall in love with a person who has tortured you for the sake of some obscure but sacred goal.<br/><br/>Ladies and Gentlemen. Those of you who adore this movie.

Why are you so easily buying the old, shabby and faded communist ideas, only because they are put into a new DVD box and a beautiful girl is bringing them to you from the wide screen?<br/><br/>For those of you who don't understand Russian, let me translate just one sentence from the first Soviet rhythm (the Communist Internationale): ""All world of violence we shall destroy down to the foundation, and then we shall build our new world."" The first part of it (""we shall destroy"") is kind of obvious, isn't it, but what about the second part (""we shall build"")?! This movie tells you: ""We did it. We destroyed. That's it. Happyend"". Ha. Ha. Ha. I have been to this movie before. Believe me, it was a real Horror.<br/><br/>Dear Mister V! (I doubt you can hear me though :) You suffered, I know. You desired revenge. You killed everybody you hated. Fair enough. But who gave you the right to explode the Palace of Westminster? It existed long before the 400-year-old story of November the 5th. Regimes come and go, but the Palace of Westminster is an eternal symbol. No human being is eligible to destroy it. Nobody. In 1948 Arabs exploded Hurva, the most important synagogue in Jerusalem, why do you think that it made the world better? Are you one of those people to whom 9/11 returned their hope?<br/><br/>Dear Misters Wachowski! Your movie says: ""Come up. Go. Blast it."" Will you peacefully sleep at nights if one day a nice (Muslim?) boy inspired by your ideas demolishes Big Ben, in reality, not in cinema? Why do you allow yourself to spread such a straightforward propaganda of terrorism? Aha, freedom of speech That's what you'll tell me... But probably freedom of speech is not what you think it is. Eveybody in the US has freedom of speech, but _you_ have an exclusive freedom _to_be_heard_. I can yell and swear here till tomorrow morning, nobody will give a damn. You should think twice before using your freedom of speech, why don't you do so? Obviously, all you care about is the ten million bucks you'll make out of this pathetic revolution. How sad...<br/><br/>Also, I wanted to ask you, dear Wachowski Brothers: did you ever hear about Nazism? I suppose you did, otherwise why your Chancellor Adam Sutler is so similar to Adolf Hitler. You made this association clear even to degenerates. But why didn't characters in your movie ever hear about Nazism? Because they are stupider than degenerates? Because all of them have short memories? Or because dealing with the past would have messed your clear point? Do you really think that our civilization can afford having Hitler in London? You must be kidding then... It didn't allow Milosevic in Belgrade, nor it allowed Saddam in Baghdad. By the way, where is our civilization in your movie? Does the entire planet contain only London? Where is internet, wireless network, satellite television? We _did_ manage to listen to BBC 25 years ago in Moscow, before the information era began... If you _do_ manage to ignore common sense and let your futuristic society be so unreal, then why are you making such an explicit political statement?<br/><br/>Dear Evey. You were perfect.

"billion_mucks","3","5","13","13 November 2007"," Viciously Overrated
","I went with high expectations to watch ""V for Vendetta"". The Wachowski's reputation on creating poignant, smart action packed rides preceded them. With ""Matrix"" not only did I get one of the freshest action films but one of the sharpest and deepest scripts ever written. All I can give to this movie as a word is ""pseudo"". V is a pseudo-hero, that prefers to talk and digress than commit the noble acts. James McTiegue knows how to cope with filmical elements, but that's all. V (by Hugo Weaving) doesn't relate to the audience and has no point of contact with any common human, his basis of thoughts are fragile and biased. A hero in an anarchy isn't only interesting (not on the way delivered) but unoriginal. And political. Who could move it to a higher ground? All what it tries to achieve it fails. V is also Pseudo-Cool. His Shakespearean, long dialogs are boring and unfelt. All seems like an improvised catharsis.<br/><br/>What's new on ""V for Vendetta""? Absolutely nothing. No chemistry between the two leads, empty dialogs and many colors and fireworks to dazzle us an distract us from the lack of good action, a steamy screenplay on action or clever and quick on themes and messages. Not only does it fail in delivering a message, ideology or thinking line (no power in communication to the audience) but it also lacks a good atmosphere and tons of action are missing. I hoped for much, maybe. It had many elements to bring new things on the ground. It busted them too soon.<br/><br/>Long story short, this movie is unfelt and shy, keeping a close remark to the comic books, giving it no further nor personal power. Long, it is a feast on neat sound effects an clean CGI (which tries to push us further from the weak adapted script). It could have been a lot more; for you that like new, fresh movies. Skip this. In my humble opinion, it's unnecessary."
"Skittixch","3","5","13","19 March 2006"," It left much to be desired
","Personally, I felt that the most poetic part of this movie was during the end credits. The audience having been called upon for revolution, to march to the streets to fight for change, calmly exited the theatre and drove back to their homes having been entertained for an evening.<br/><br/>I've got no problem with the story, nor the acting. Natalie Portman's performance was superb.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta exposes a flaw of many young artists who strive for impact in the most direct means. During the opening sequence, we are confronted by a televised statement detailing the ""proper"" interpretation of the film for it's entire duration. This is immediately restrictive and does not allow for the audience to immerse themselves into the problems detailed in the narrative. I could go further, exposing directorial as well as aural and cinematographic flaws within the film as well.<br/><br/>To be perfectly fair, V for Vendetta is not without it's redeeming moments. The sequence in which Evey is imprisoned is constructed beautifully, with a gripping conclusion, though the introduction of the homosexual affair of the previous prisoner felt forced, as though the director found another place in which he might squeeze something culturally relevant without regard for narrative implications.<br/><br/>My final comment: If you understand the difference between passive viewing and active viewing of cinema, this movie is not for you. It is just deep enough for the average teenybopper to find it ""profound"", while just shallow enough for the critical audience to skim over it without remorse"

","I had such high expectations for this movie and it was so terribly disappointing. The previews made it look so good and I can confidently say that although i found it mildly entertaining, it did not live up to the hype. There is a real lack of action in this movie because most of the movie is conveying a political message. It has a nice beginning and a decent end but everything in between is so dry and boring, it was very difficult to stay awake. Save yourself some money and don't waste the two hours and some odd minuets seeing this.

If not, don't waste your money. <br/><br/>Apparently the Britain that exists in this movie is a direct result of Bush's actions in Iraq and those actions resulted in the totalitarian regime portrayed, as well as the disintegration of the social structure in the United States. Throw in some gay bashing, Muslim hating, mistreatment of Blacks, Bush creating Avian flu to use as a biological weapon, and you have the gist of the movie. Short of actually saying, ""Citizens of the US rise up and revolt"", the implication is obvious. I am sure the movie was set in Great Britain to imply that the rest of the world better watch out as well. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the music and the fireworks, otherwise this rating would be a 1.

I guess there's a message that the filmmaker wanted to deliver but it's so shallowly constructed that it left no impact whatsoever.<br/><br/>The biggest problem of this movie is its lack of imagination. Evey character is portrayed with clichéd stereotypes. A fascist dictator has to talk in a certain way with a certain accent, and so on, all incredibly tiresome. This movie is also low on entertainment value. Is it an action film, or a thriller, or a drama? It's a mixture of all of the above but the end result is none of them. Bottom line is the filmmaker tried too hard to be cool but didn't have the talent to deliver. Another case of wasted money and time. Another case of Hollywood mediocrity."

","After reading the graphic novel I was expecting the film to be bad in comparison but I was so wrong! The film had taken everything interesting out of Alan Moore's comic and thrown it away using the remains to form this awful movie. The story, although carrying a good performance from Natalie Portman, lacked the wit of the comic and the superior nature of V. The film seemed to make V too human and the Hollywood style death was dire as he declares his love for Evey.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the film then that's your opinion but in comparison to Alan Moore's work of art I'd rather stick pins in my eyes than watch the film again."
"master-103","1","6","17","7 August 2006"," Insulting to the end
","I finished this movie wishing I could have my two hours back. It was consistently stupid both in it's story and it's assumption of what the viewer was going to take from it. Yes, it was a 'comic book' movie. But unlike your typical comic book movie, it took itself quite seriously and drew blatant parallels between this story and the 9/11 bombings. If you're going to make accusations the way this film did, maybe you should take a few minutes to think each angle of your story through, so that your message can be taken seriously. Are we really to believe that V, in this big brother society where every action is monitored and traced, could have ordered tens of thousands (if not more) of the Guy Fox masks and costumes, and then have them delivered without being noticed? Are we also to believe that the government would really dismiss the possibility of the train tracks? Are we really to believe that after a few days with V, and after he tortured her, Nathalie Portman's character was going to fall for him the way she does? Stupid. Across the board stupid. Well acted, well shot, fantastic effects and good editing, all ruined by lazy storytelling of the worst kind. The worst part is that this film was so self-important. But then again, what else would I expect from the self-important creators of the equally disappointing Matrix series?"

","Alaon Moore? Who the heck is that? I thought the original novel was made by David Lloyd? HA! You bet! Because the only one mentioned in the roller is Davi Lloyd. But do not be tricked. The original novel was written by Alan Moore.<br/><br/>So, what do we say about a movie based on a novel, whom's creator does not want to be mentioned in the roller? Let us begin with nearly the very first sentence of the movie which is (quote)""(...)It is not an idea that i miss, it is a man (...)"". That is, what Hollywood wants us to think; entangling us with shoddy Hollywood love due love is more complex than a ""i love you wee (buhuuhu)"". Alan Moore understood that. What the book truly is about is (quote again) V: ""(...)you must discover whose face lies behind this mask, but you must never know my face."" Because, Mr. Wachowskis: (whispering) the book indeed IS about the idea, not about a man. You try to point that out in the end (bad bad SPOILER) ""he is my brother, father, mother, blab-la"", but did you all really understand? I did not, so i read the comic and it is much better than this load of crap. Besides: if you read the comic you begin to clearly see how weapons dictate us-productions.<br/><br/>Last hint: read the original novel."
"danielmcgill","1","6","17","4 May 2006"," The Worst Movie I've paid to see.
","The only thing, in all honesty, that stopped me walking out of the theatre mid-screening was that I fell asleep. The only aspect of the movie that held my attention for any period of time, besides Portman's improbable beauty was the soundtrack. Ignoring Portman's obvious aesthetic charm her acting credentials must be questioned, between this and the new Star Wars trilogy she is more weeping her way through roles rather than acting through them. She added nothing to this movie bar a pretty face. After the Matrix trilogy, I am sick of hearing Hugo Weaving talk even though admittedly his voice, had it been new, would have suited the character of V perfectly. In terms of his role, It was over-acted and didn't feel real at all. Plus that speech-with-everything-beginning-with-v made me laugh out loud out of sheer disgust. The ensemble cast was uninspiring and the whole thing appeared cobbled together without coherency. I haven't read the graphic novel and this certainly didn't inspire me to want to. A hideous movie, and two hours I can't get back."
"patrickbateman1986","1","6","17","21 March 2006"," Did I watch the same film?
","Having seen the film I'm slightly surprised by the glowing reviews it has received. As its tosh. Apart from some of the mad dialogue, parts of which were surreal (best example being the 'did you kill him' chat on the sofa). My favourite part was when V was by the stove cooking in his piny with mask on, here he jumped from violent hero to housewife cooking breakfast.<br/><br/>I've noticed some people find this film politically moving, this I cannot understand, to those that haven't seen it, I'd rate it around the same level as Equilibrium and Sky Captain. If anyone is changed by this film, they are frankly moronic. <br/><br/>The characters were either from comic books or else an ITV detective show, probably a drama premiere on a Wednesday. The comic book and masked hero, able to withstand scores of bullets then move fast enough to get a swoosh noise is hunted by a unwashed detective in a Rover 25. I was waiting for a moustached David Jason to appear, resplendent with hat and raincoat, to nick V, stuff him in the back of a police car and retire to the pub.<br/><br/>Stephen Frys inclusion was the stuff of genius and kept the film from sinking without trace. Fry wondered around playing himself and doing not much else,even if his character was completely unnecessary. The film died a little when he did. The man behind V, we learn, died a long time ago, leaving only the idea, and a series of gaping plot holes. Weaving played the role well, the role of trying to prevent the audience to burst into tears of laughter every time he pranced on stage. Portman was decent. <br/><br/>This film was never going anywhere, with a mad script, convoluted plot and little focus (characters wondered in and out of the film with little direction)destroyed any hope for this film.<br/><br/>To conclude, this film should have either been made into a full-on comedy, rather than producing unintentional laughs, or else your standard Punisher-esquire film devoid of anything but violence. Comic book characters and plot and important messages don't mix, and this film shows that clearly."

It ruined an otherwise entertaining film and it's no wonder Alan Moore wants nothing to do with it. 
Sad. Stupid. I know there are people who hate art, but can't they sabotage it with a little more subtlety? If you're making a movie, inject your ideas by all means but don't make us gag on it.

"evoid","10","4","10","10 January 2009"," Love it or hate it
","I have watched 'V for Vendetta' five times by now, the first time four weeks ago. Every time I discovered some important new aspects I have not realized before. First off I want to state that this has become my favourite movie, as a consequence of this I can give it a 10 of 10 in good conscience. I'm writing this comment as a reply to a comment a user named Traveller wrote back in 2007, although I think he never will read my reply. I believe you'll get my point even without knowing the comment I'm referring to.<br/><br/>Traveller, I totally disagree with your position. The stylistic device of exaggeration is nothing special - It's just as Evey quotes her dad in the movie, ""artists use lies to tell the truth, while politicians use them to cover the truth up"". I don't believe the point that Sutler is a member of the Conservative Party of England to be of great importance. Of course there have been some efforts in England for the last 20 years that are criticized by the film, but I see 'V for Vendetta' as criticism on the cut down of individual rights and personal freedom in many countries, not especially England. I think it's also a stylistic device, that the film deals with England exemplarily whereas it's meaning is more general. This stylistic device of concretion allows the audience a much closer experience of the plot and identification with the characters. It has been used at another important aspect in this movie: The character of 'V'. There are countless hints in the movie that tell us, that 'V' actually is not an individual but a representation of any person, for instance: 'V' saying ""Who is but the form following the function of what"", Gordon saying to Evey he was 'V', or the fact that 'V' never takes off his mask. Actually I would have hated Evey for taking off his mask in the final scene, because it would have destroyed this important aspect of 'V for Vendetta'.<br/><br/>Furthermore it isn't right that the hero's skills are never explained. It is being told in the movie that he was genetically modified. It is of less matter to the audience the movie addresses, *how* 'V' manages to ""breeze his way through the most advanced security systems"". And because we know, that 'V' succeeded to steel some butter from Chancellor Sutler, we can easily imagine that it's not a big deal to dig up some money. In 'V for Vendetta' it is of less matter *how* things are done than *why*. When you're keen on watching bad guys being slaughtered esthetically, watch a different genre, watch movies like Riddick or 300.<br/><br/>It is also wrong that 'V' will ""go to any lengths to force his views on people"". In his speech on the government's TV channel he calls on the people to follow him *if* they have recognized the government's crimes and they feel ready to stand up against it. The point that 'V' imprisoned Evey is a complex one: On the one hand, you have to say that Evey told 'V' her wish to lose all her fear. In the end of her imprisonment 'V' tells her to ""have no fear any more"" and to be ""completely free"". On the other hand, this point erases the illusion of a separation between good and evil: There's nothing good without something evil inside, or: In order to achieve the good, the evil's practices are being used - in our world - not stating whether this is bad or not. This point has a lot of depth to think about.<br/><br/>As you can see, this is *not* a ""hollow, ostentatious, politically outdated lump of pseudo-anarchist propaganda"" at all, it's just someone missing the opportunity to take a look under the surface, to read between the lines, to think about the input you're receiving. But in my honest opinion, exactly *this* is the main purpose of art: To make people think. Most of all, the topic the movie deals with is not outdated: Ever heard the terms Patriot Act or Thatcherism? I think I even discovered an allusion on 9/11.<br/><br/>The fact that 'V' keeps quoting ""the great works of literature"" may be less related to the plot. But what's wrong with packing a message into a beautiful quotation? To be honest, most of his quotations gave me the creeps. I think there's nothing to complain about at this point.<br/><br/>You have asked, why ""a simple chief-inspector of police"" is ""investigating a case that has the potential to bring down the whole of society?"" The answer is: Because he is *simple*, because he is still a human being. That's exactly what this chief-inspector says about 'V' in the film.<br/><br/>To come to talk to the acting, especially that of Stephen Rea as chief-inspector Finch: I've not experienced him as stricken at all, but as consequently stoical. After all, he is sober and bold enough to question his chiefs. I think this role is played quite well.<br/><br/>Finally I have to admit that I have not understood the relation to Guy Fawkes as well: Yes, he was a man standing behind his idea while facing the death, but I think there were quite a lot of people in history who did so.<br/><br/>I think it is remarkable that 80% of the ratings this movie received are either 1, 8, 9 or 10 of 10: There are very few ratings in between. It seems like you either have to love this movie or you have to hate it. My personal explanation for this is that the people who rated 1 of 10 didn't really understand it - It's not a movie you can just watch, it's greatest trump is that it makes you think a lot. But if you don't notice that, you will think that it's flat and hollow."

I gave it 3 because the acting of Natalie Portman was pretty good. She was the only thing I liked in the film. Natalie had good acting but the support wasn't good at all.

Forget embarrassed, I was DISGUSTED by by how such a proactive comic could be so completely destroyed and transformed into a pseudo-social commentary. <br/><br/>If you want to experience an epiphany or some life-altering moment, read the comic.

This movie is asinine, juvenile and just plain derivative. There are so many films this movie has copied that are SO much better it is almost pointless to watch it. The teenage melodrama that exudes from this stinker is like ""The Crow"" with bigger acne pimples. If you think this is a 'good' film try watching ""Brazil"", the director's cut of ""Blade Runner"" or even ""1984"" (not great but a masterpiece when compared to this crap). This is not as bad as ""Sin City"" (my vote for the worst film of 2005) but it has so much sucky teen angst that it will make you want to buy a slurpee and ride a BMX.

The last movie I saw was Jarhead and did that movie suck too. Jarhead and V for Vandetta both did not have a story line and still did good in the box office. Has anyone ever heard of a storyline?

"Chicky5150","2","4","10","20 March 2006"," A Preachy Adaptation
","This movie is doomed by the quality of its source material. The movie and plot are utterly undermined by the Wachowski brother's preachy style of storytelling. The graphic novel is a flawed but brilliant work, losing some steam and focus in the middle, but combining a revenge story with larger themes about how governments go wrong, and why people let them do it.<br/><br/>But the movie inexplicably adds a subplot about a killer virus, takes away the motivation and screen time of all the ""villians,"" removes a great deal of the action from the book, makes the motivation of the characters inconsistent, and the internal logic of the film shaky. No wonder Moore wants nothing to do with films of his work."
"player98321","4","4","10","19 March 2006"," Stylistically vibrant, but aesthetically questionable
","V for Vendetta is a politically charged film where my own personal political views have to be taken into account when reviewing this film. The film is an obvious allegory to the Bush Administration and is unapologetic about it. Which is fine: this form of artistic expression has to happen in a free society. But the film doesn't handle its allegory with enough subtlety and implicitly that most great satires do. At times, ""V for Vendetta"" feels downright preachy. It even portrays ideas that the filmmakers probably didn't intend to.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT: The ending, where everyone approaches the exploding parliament wearing the same mask, reminds me of a Communist revolution. Everyone is dressed and looks the same, without a hint of individuality. It was an ending that's hard to feel victorious about since my personal views equate Communism with Fascism.<br/><br/>Other than that, I have to admit that the film is an achievement in visual style. There are some great camera work and memorable images. The performances are all first rate, despite Portman's slip ups with her British accent. Weaving does a great job even with the hindrance of the mask. I see a bright future with the director, as long as he chooses better scripts."
"skiggz","4","4","10","19 March 2006"," As Smug as the Titular V's Mask
","Thoroughly mediocre, V for Vendetta fails on all three levels. For some, it's a movie adaptation of a graphic novel, for others it's a political allegory, and for the rest of us it's an action flick. But in none of these areas does the film deliver $6's worth. The political commentary is bland and heavy-handed. Comparisons to the current GoP regime in America are plentiful and not in the least subtle. Its anti-establishment message could only offend if you hate sexy lesbians, and will only inspire if you think 9/11 was the result of an intricate government conspiracy.<br/><br/>As an action movie, V for Vendetta is awfully bland, featuring hardly enough action to fill 2+ hours. The climactic fight scene is rather brief and feels derivative of Equilibrium or maybe the latest Prince of Persia video game. Moreover, Natalie Portman's character is largely irrelevant to the plot and very nearly could have been omitted if not for the unnecessary love interest.<br/><br/>Most infuriatingly is the obvious hand of the Wachowski brothers as writers. V's vociferously verbose alliteration (you see what I did there?) and obnoxious tendency to quote any book more than a few centuries old brought me to tired yawns very quickly. As the Wachowskis pat themselves on the back for yet another brilliant movie that borrows heavily from Dumas, Orwell, etc, etc, I see their faces curled in the same infuriating smirk as the protagonist's mask."
"NostalgicNocturne","10","4","10","19 March 2006"," Veracious Venerable Vendetta!
","Where to begin? I was determined to see whether or not the Wachowski brothers would stay true to the novel. With all the hype and media attention drawn to the movie, it was nothing short of perfection. For those who have read the comic, it is obvious that things have changed but I believe they are for the better. Certain situations allow you to get a sense of satisfaction that you did not get from the comic. There is already satisfaction because V for Vendetta has been brought to life! Of course, the movie does leave you thinking about society, people, and a sense of wisdom. Walking out of the theater, it made a huge commentary on our current society and government. For those who have read the comic, I think you can agree that it applies more to today than it did two decades ago. The scariest thing is that V for Vendetta can still be applied to modern day even 25 years after it was published.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman shows a wide spectrum of emotions and talent which haven't been seen for in the Star Wars trilogy. She portrays Evey Hammond with a perfect execution. Of course, Hugo Weaving cannot be forgotten. As you watch the movie, his voice is so captivating, it sounded the way V should. Portman and Weaving were the perfect actors for the roles. I couldn't possibly imagine James Purefoy as V.<br/><br/>So please, do not avoid this movie just because of the controversy, the politics, and the on-going terrorism events. It is a movie that leaves you captivated. V for Vendetta allows the audience to feel empathy, sympathy, and compassion. It isn't just an action movie filled with politics, it is so much more than that. V for Vendetta is the movie for our generation."

The allusions to Dr. Faustus, and The Count of Monte Christo were superb, and the movie itself showed what a government should not allowed to become. Being a south, white, conservative I have certain ideas about what a government should be as do many others just like me, and although parts of the movie would be very offensive to someone like myself, I instead found myself in a world of free though, exactly what V himself was promoting.

The story is dialog heavy and you need to pay close attention to what people are saying.<br/><br/>The advertisements for this film were a bit misleading because they make it look like your run of the mill comic book fantasy, but it is really much more. This is a film for adults who are interested in story and ideas. Warning: If you ever considered Bill O'Reily or Rush Lindbaugh to have a worthwhile idea, do not see this film! You will find it offensive.

It isn't the best film in the world and it is V for Verbose, but as Pastor Martin Niemöller said of the Nazi's <br/><br/>"" In Germany they first came for the Communists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist. <br/><br/>Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew. <br/><br/>Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist. <br/><br/>Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant. <br/><br/>Then they came for me  and by that time no one was left to speak up.""<br/><br/>Alan Moore originally conceived this as an attack on Thatcherism and I am sure that the Labour party back in the early 80's read the book and chuckled and thought "" This'll stick it to that Thatcher b***h ""<br/><br/>How the worm has turned; ID cards, CCTV everywhere, our human rights quashed in the name of ""FREEDOM"" and ""ANTI-TERRORISM"", Spin doctors running the country.... It really is an eye opener, and chilled me to the bone. We accept higher taxes, more censorship, less freedom, heavy handed policing, religious intolerance, political correctness, and the nanny-state because ""THEY ARE LOOKING OUT FOR US"" - Please everyone, open your eyes and see where we are heading. Hail Chancellor Blair?<br/><br/>Phew...that's the rant over with. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and it was nice to see the shops at the back of my road used for the set (where was I that day ???). This is intelligent fare although a few liberties have been taken with the original concept but, hey, that's the movies for you - if we stuck to the script, we'd get Pink Panther the Remake ( Insert noise of Sideshow Bob stepping on rakes here ! )<br/><br/>P.S. Nice to hear a seldom used Rolling Stones track at the end.<br/><br/>Pickles"
"rsol55","2","31","136","12 March 2006"," Propaganda, no more
","Basically, it's hysterical left-wing propaganda. It comes across as quite out of date in its atmosphere and symbolism, since it was written in the 1980's when Alan Moore apparently thought that the democratically elected Thatcher was equivalent to Hitler - Godwinism in the comic world.<br/><br/>Not only is the symbolism out of date, it's often parochially British and quite ignorant in its usage. The mask the terrorist wears is a Guy Fawkes mask, Guy Fawkes being the person who tried to blow up the British Parliament in 1605. He was no ""freedom fighter"" in reality; he was trying to clear the way for a Catholic theocratic monarchy.<br/><br/>I found the visuals to be depressing and off putting as well."
"Leofwine_draca","1","7","22","27 November 2016"," Badly made and offensive to boot
","Words alone cannot convey how utterly loathsome I found this movie to be. I'd heard all the hype beforehand – how it was the 'next big thing', how it's even garnered a place in the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 films of all time (above Hitchcock and Scorsese, no less). I think it's fair to say that I was expecting a decent film when I finally sat down to watch it one evening. What a let down. V FOR VENDETTA is nothing more than a liberal's idle fantasy writ large on screen.<br/><br/>From the word go this is a monstrous mess. We're thrown into yet another Big Brother-controlled futuristic society (yawn) where individuality is condemned and the sinister government watches our every move. Our heroine is supposedly a tough, streetwise Londoner, and somebody decided to cast butter-wouldn't-melt Natalie Portman in the role. Oh my god! Not only does her English accent sound stupid – not fitting the character at all – but her acting is unbelievably poor, and frequently laughable in places. Not that she's given much acting to do. This is a film written by a GCSE English student who thinks sub-Shakespeare standard dialogue is the height of literary brilliance. Can you say PRETENTIOUS? The second 'V' arrived and began spouting some absolutely inane gibberish I knew this was going to be bad, but I had little idea of just how bad it was going to turn out.<br/><br/>It's an offensive, violent mess, in which the sprawling action scenes are choreographed to uninteresting boredom. The film toys with Nazi symbolism throughout, to the extent that we see concentration camps with inmates being buried in mass graves. Wow, taking real-life history and using it to add controversy to your money-making film? That's pretty low – and far more objectionable than the many low budget exploitation horrors I usually watch. And, sigh, it turns out that Christians are bad as usual. Why not pick another religion? Oh, I know, there would be an outcry and a fuss, that's why.<br/><br/>At least Hugo Weaving gets to hide behind a mask to spare his blushes for the film's duration. Not so Stephen Fry, who looks distinctly embarrassed to appear in this mess, or a slumming John Hurt. Worst of all is Stephen Rea, who has lots of scenes as the detective investigating 'V'. He's saddled with one of the most boring characters in film history, and is given WAY too much screen time. No wonder he looks like he's asleep for most of the time. I'm sorry, and I hate to say it, but this film's absolute junk."
"mcranna","1","5","14","12 July 2012"," Just AWFUL
","This film is simply awful. Simplistic, plodding, clichéd, tired and utterly unoriginal. The script could have been written by a computer randomly taking clichés from the Hollywood cliché database.<br/><br/>I am so sick of films where the only answer to real-world problems is ludicrous super or semi-superpowers performed by a boy fantasy-Messiah- like figure and where the masses are depicted one moment as uniformly stupid and then suddenly uniformly and politically aware, and then sheep like, turn up to ""put things right."" <br/><br/>The final scene where the population of London turn up in Guy Fawkes costumes at the Houses of Parliament is like something from the worst patriotic, American skin deep pap."
"bigverybadtom","1","5","14","28 May 2012"," R For Ridiculous
","First of all, I never read the graphic novel it was based on so I cannot compare the movie to that. Second, I am American so I cannot view it from a British perspective-and I've noticed a lot of Britons and/or readers of the graphic novel disliked this film.<br/><br/>But I did already know that Guy Fawkes was a Catholic terrorist who tried and failed to blow up both houses of Parliament in response to the British persecution of Catholics in his era. (We Americans aren't complete ignoramuses after all.) Yet the character V, who evidently models himself on Fawkes, supposedly intends to destroy the fascist government ruling Britain by blowing up Parliament and other major British symbols, evidently with the effect of returning the country to something better-anarchy? Democracy? The movie simply ends after Big Ben and Parliament are blown apart.<br/><br/>The totalitarian government uses Christianity as a means of oppression, even though modern Britain isn't strongly religious. Also, a homosexual has a copy of the Koran and loves its poetry, which is tantamount to a Jew enjoying Mein Kampf, neither of which are symbols of freedom. And what of V having a basement full of forbidden antiques-how would someone like him have the time and energy to accumulate all this? And how does he manage to make and send all those masks to the public in a society where everyone and everything is being watched? That spoiled things right there-along with all the people donning V costumes and walking up to Parliament, past armed soldiers, unmolested? The whole thing gets ridiculous.<br/><br/>And as for V himself, he's supposed to have been badly burned in a fire which ruined his flesh, yet he's super-adept physically and can speak normally. And he personally deceives and tortures his protégé to cure her of fear-and she still sticks by him and speaks admiringly of him in the end.<br/><br/>There's more, but I think I said enough already."
"empbb","2","5","14","23 February 2012"," Glorified terrorism
","The movie presents a version of evens that feature: Government conspiracy to subjugate it's people into complete submission and establish a dictatorship. Followed by prosecution of the people that is reminiscent of the church burnings during dark ages. Of course mixed in are secret genetic experiments. And finally we have a lunatic anarchist who was a subject to the genetic experiments and turned super human, turned terrorist bent on annihilating the institution of order. How glorious is his cause of blowing up the London parliament. According to this movie, we should all be worshiping Osama Bin Laden as the best thing that ever happened to the free world.<br/><br/>I am giving this 2 of 10 because of the movie completely bent on scaring people into revolting against ""the man"". It would be 1 of 10 but the play acting is actually somewhat good. So, I've added 1 star for the actors doing their job at least."

","I love this movie. I found the martial arts in this film are first class without being the Chinese Chop/Sock variety. Not over done, yet flow within and adding to the story line. Special effects were appropriate not over the top with people flying etc. I found the warnings against those who are bent on control without regard to their citizens are something that all people would do well to consider these include but are not limited to: one, that the government is to fear the people, not the people fear the government; two, That the evil rulers are the ones who would rather destroy a nation with disease or virus then steal their wealth, rather than through the use of a Nuclear War; third, the use of domestic violence is an effective means of population control; fourth, people are willing to give up their freedoms for safety provided by the government, as long as they do not know what is going on. It sounds so much like the Bush administration in the United States, I wonder if there was a message hidden here somewhere? This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time I have not tired of watching it again and again."

It may disturb some to watch, but the lesson on human nature versus the longing for power is far-reaching.<br/><br/>The soundtrack draws out your emotions and wraps you into the world.<br/><br/>This is a singularly lovely piece of film that is worthy of a place in everyone's collection.<br/><br/>No matter your political views, you will love this film.<br/><br/>This work will make you think, and leave you in tears, too."

This is the typical pretentious movie which fails with its acting and pseudo-wisdom. The typical movie you don't like and people tell you ""You didn't get it"", while that people just pretend to have found something profound.<br/><br/>I admit the movie idea and plot were great but I really do not like the way it was executed. The main characters are portrayed very badly. One of them is this wooden woman called Natalie Portman who used to be great when she was a teen. The other is a stupid clown cracking stupid jokes. Do people know a mask cannot act?<br/><br/>Also the movie has a VERY slow pace and boring speech. I think this movie would have been more interesting with more action/suspense and without those stupid and UNNECESSARY lesbian scenes that were revolting for me, just as example.<br/><br/>From the Wachoski brothers I was expecting something more interesting but I bet they are that kind of people who make one thing in their lives and bye bye, I mean, The Matrix, because its sequels were awful too."

Pleaseeee, rain on no more clichés. There wasn't enough violence or special effects to make up for sitting through this twaddle. I would have left after 30 minutes, but my daughter wanted to see the end - I could have told her by then what it was going to be!

"phoenix2000ad","2","5","14","20 March 2006"," V for Vendetta gets a V out of X.
","I must say that I am highly disappointed in the overall fair. I had high expectations for this movie, yet I feel let down. Far to many people are making an issue out of this movie's plot and it's shallow relationship with the current foreign policy situation the US finds itself in. A lot of people must have forgotten about examples of terrorism in places like Beirut, Isreal, Chile, Japan, etc. The problem with trying to force a moral parallel between this movie and with our present situation is that as history moves on, more knowledge shall come to light and our perspectives shall change, thus recasting this movie in a different light. For now, people just want a medium through which they can vex about the US's current national security and foreign policy failures, and a lot of movie critics and other pseudo-intellectuals are using this film as such.<br/><br/>In defense of the movie, the individual sum of parts were very nice. The cinematography just captured the mood and brooding essence of Alan Moore's story. The Wachowski Bros. scored big points for casting Natalie Portman, for if you read the comic you realize that Miss Portman cast strong resemblances to Dan Lloyd's Evey. Hugo Weaving really showed his acting chops. I always admired him in Priscilla: Queen of the Desert, The Matrix Trilogies and Lord of the Ring, but he really does act here. Due to the mask, Weaving could not cheat with facial expressions. Instead he is forced to create a vocabulary of physical mannerisms to add emphasis to his voice. (He really should earn an Oscar for any future projects.) And speaking of voices, V's voice is the real character of the film. Which is sad, because the producers and directors lost an opportunity to contrast the voice of fate against the voice of V.<br/><br/>The overall flow of the story were in some places too fast and in others too slow. V is a very enigmatic yet methodical man who never does anything without a reason. Sadly I never felt this at all. No, I think a good portion of the film wasted time trying to highlight some small element of V's humanity, which is wrong because V is a symbol, an ideal. He subordinates all elements of his humanity to the achievement of his ideal, causing friction with Evey and alienating him from her at times. Which brings up the point that the writers and directors did not place enough focus on the two leads relationship to the extent that we see the nuances and changes that their relationship goes through over the course of the film.<br/><br/>One of the primary themes of Alan Moore's story is simply transformation. The transformation from totalitarianism to individual self governance; from Ordnung to Verwirrung. Instead of detailing the reign of terror where the individual citizens rise up and plunge England into a state of disaster, the production team creates a sequence where all the citizens (dressed as V) conveniently encounter the army right about the time of V's death. (I can only say that this was for some ambiguous, artistic dramatic effect.) This is completely anathema to Evey's prison sequence in which V subjects her to torture; the ritual of this experience was designed to free her from her own inner prison of fear, transforming her from a girl frightened to live due to the temporal powers above her into a woman devoid of fear, who is daring enough to live as she pleases. This scene is finalized in a baptism/rebirthing in which Evey exposes herself to the elemental powers of nature, thus washing away the old girl and giving life to a woman willing to live. You see, it was Evey who was supposed to transform herself into the symbol of freedom for the new era. It was for her to transform herself in V and lead the new Britain in a new age. Thus when the writers wrote out Evey's role and replaced it with that scene of Vs, they essentially killed the significance of Eve's imprisonment and release.<br/><br/>Alan Moore should have consulted Frank Miller on how best to translate his comic into a movie. Sadly this is his second disappointment, the first being League of Extraordinary Gentleman. The only way this project could have worked out well was if it were made into a four hour, two-part HBO special."

","My god, this was a boring film. Two hours and 20 minutes that seemed more like six hours. There was way too much talk, interwoven plot lines that made little sense and a paucity of any kind of action until the very end. As for a political statement, that the government should be afraid of the people instead of the other way around: Fine, blow up Parliament but don't take so freakin' long to do it. If I had been alone, I would have walked out before it was half over; as it turns out my companion would have joined me but we both ended up suffering. How does anyone sit down and watch the final cut of a movie as bad as this and say to themselves, ""This is it. It's good to go."" V was boring, Natalie Portman unconvincing as the girl who falls in love with the mystery man behind the mask. And what was all that about the letters written on toilet paper? I probably just wasn't paying attention. I'd taken my glasses off long before that since I really didn't care what was going on. Bad movie! on. Bad movie!"
"jrlewis79","1","10","35","19 March 2006"," unmitigated crap and pure liberal propaganda
","If movies preach truthand, unfortunately, to so many people who see nothing else BUT truth when watching filmsthen apparently to have a conservative thought in your head is be equated with Hitler, to profess spiritual allegiance to the Church is to be a perverted pedophile, and to be a person of any sort of inspiration or consequence is to be gay (closet or open) or to break every rule of the book whenever you darn well please, killing whomever dares to rise against you, and inciting riots through your ill-placed, misguided message of anarchy in which who knows how many people ended up killing those around them in acting out their violence. That the film takes a shameless stance against the Church by depicting a perverted, lustful, pedophiliac bishop (oh, who's also apparently greedy and materialistic as we learned from his exorbitant salary) is merely the start of its ultra-liberal stance against anything traditional. Nevermind the fact that the Church here in America is already suffering from our own mistakes; go ahead and hit us when we're downthat's the message here. That the apparently ONLY way to be revered as a true hero and source of inspiration is to be of this ultra-liberal mindset, to take a purely anarchist stance against any form of authority, and to embrace alternative lifestyles as if to so is to be righteous and filled with virtuethis is the ultimate ""moral"" of this awful travesty called film. But God forbid that there be a movie made in which a conservativeeven a Catholic priestis depicted as the hero! And all of that is a critique only of the film's messageill-placed and misguided as it is. To critique the film's merits and qualities is another matter, and to start off my review there, it's simple: these supposed merits and qualities are nearly as bottom-feeding-trash as the message that is preached. First of all, clearly, the oppressive government is meant to be some sort of ""Big Brother"" a la 1984, and the Chancellor's rise to power is meant to be reminiscent of Hitler. Lest we have never read 1984 or have forgotten about Hitler's politics and insane social policies, every religion, including and, in some case, especially Catholicism suffered prejudice and persecution. In 1984, religion simply ceased to be (hm, sounds like the direction America's headed). Under Hitler, the Church's members suffered public humiliation, imprisonment, torture, and death (hm, sounds like America once again. I guess anti-Catholicism really is the last form of acceptable persecution in the U.S. After all, say or do anything disparaging against Judaism or Islam or Scientology or Latter-Day Saints, and you're prejudiced and should be shot on sight; do or so anything of the same sort against Catholics, and you're praised a hero. Hm. Can any sayHYPOCRISY?). And yet, in V, the ruling government embraces Catholicism as the only religion. It's tough to buy this government as truly a sort of ""Big Brother"" or Naziism with that sort of religious preference taking place amongst the government's ruling class. Secondly, what sorts of oppression did the film actually depict or even allude to? An imposed curfew, the banning of certain music and works of art, and discrimination against the hetero, Catholic ruling class. While this last point is never acceptable and is, in fact, horrifying to see in any society, fiction or not, the fact remains that oppressive governments in the past and today are far, far, far more oppressive even than this. The oppression depicted here is hardly extreme, and yet, V is apparently justified in destroying buildings like a maniac and killing people left and right. What was his true aim? He said that it was to free England from oppression. And yet, who were his victims? The people who were in charge of his imprisonment and torture. Is he, then, truly a savior for the common people, or is he merely just another psychopath bent on revenge? How can anyone find inspiration in that is beyond any rational thought. The one act of true heroics came and went when V saved Evey from the government agents, and at that point, he was expected to be some sort of Batman-like savior, fighting crime in the shadows of nightthat sort of thing. Does he ever do that again. Heck no. Instead, he's busy terrorizing society, prancing about with his sword to jazz music, and killing people in his madness for vengeance. Some savior! And the dialogueoh, where do I begin? The very first speech spoken by anyone just had to be by V, and was it any sort of inspirational monologue or even an explanation of why he does what he does? Absolutely not! It's a narcissistic flurry of V-words that talk only about who he is and why he's so great and why we should revere him. Wow, I bet that makes all of us wish to be so revered for being so selfish and crazy as a loon. The one quality that the film did have, I must admit, was the acting by the four principle actors: Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, and John Hurt. Were it not for them, the film would be a complete failure rather than merely just rubbish. But such acting can be found elsewhere, in better movies, with better messages to preach, rather than in this tripe. See Brokeback for a gentler, more meaningful stance on the alternative lifestyles that are, in truth, oppressed by society. See Good Night and Good Luck for a far better film about an oppressive government leader and the fight against his self-righteous case. See V only if you want to see a freaky mask and a sample or two of pyrotechnics and special effects. Otherwise, don't see it at all."
"berndt-3","1","6","18","17 May 2006"," This is the worst movie I ever saw and I will never watch a movie again since I developed a phobia now. I don't wish to summarise any further but you may read my comment.
","This is without the shadow of a doubt the worst film I ever saw. The dialogue was typically American and maudlin in the non-pleasant way; halfway through the movie the script-writer got catatonic and refused to write anything that even was remindful of decent sentencing with sensible content(""He was my father, he was my mother, he was my lover, etc""). And mind you, it was not question of any poetic digressions, any dreamy, surreal language but simply a dim-out of the already dim-witted director.<br/><br/>The scenography was a joke. Without attempting to be self-ironic or tongue-in-cheek, this hideous screenplay presents a man, emerging from a burning house, arms raised à la He-man, grunting, and the accompanying phrase: ""I didn't look into his face. He had no face..."". This scene is, alas, not a unique faux pas of the cut-and-pasting procedure (as it would if this world was beautiful and good) but the dramatic acme of this prolonged visual anticlimax, as it echoed throughout the storyline. For example, poor Kiera Knightely (whom I expected only a little judgement from since American media has payed undue adulation to her splendid intelligence; I knew it was exaggerated but I could not imagine her being so utterly desperate as to partake in this pathetic calamity) emerges from a jolly chute into the rain. The raindrops are zoomed at as the camera endeavours to imitate the Matrix's visual technique of 'lingering and leaping' over images (however the director fails to realise that there is a whole ideology attached to that visual lingua, not only the shallow search after exciting effects). Then she opens her arms, embraces the rain and epitomises cheap renditions of 'real' emotion.<br/><br/>I understand that America has suffered. I understand that the transmutation of art into commerce is revolting and always has been - I did never expect it to be otherwise. But nonetheless, only because this worthless version of a presumably quite enjoyable comic, contains some overt elements indicating governmental conspiracy and corruption there is no need to cherish in it. Budding political conscience is most applausable, but we all know, at some level, that a plane did not make those buildings fall. You need not rely on distasteful and wannabe-kitsch (no, I did not know the concept existed, now I do, and the insight is torturous) productions in order to justify your believes.<br/><br/>The thing that is not disturbing aesthetically but ethically is the fact that the REVOLUTIONARIES ARE MORE UNIFORM THAN THE OPPRESSORS. As far as I am concerned, I shudder at the scene when innumerable masked citizen defiles across the streets; to me, it is an apparently fascist revolution. The idolatry of ONE visionary among sheep makes me want to puke because it consents to the society it wishes to overturn."

"eric262003","9","3","7","27 May 2013"," A Good Way Of Questioning Our Own Freedom
","V For Vendetta"" is a rare delight for various reasons. It has artistic qualities that succeed in being commercial worthy and is not ashamed about being manipulative. It scores high merits in terms of style and requires attention from the very opening scenes and never goes back on its intentions until the final closing credits. It never falls victim to be morally drawn in its message and for a better understanding, this a thinking person's type of movie. It never has to resort to the tiresome clichés or cheap ways to escape from a scene in a rushed kind of manner. The characters portrayed in the movie are very well-drawn and are never caricatured and never once do they preach about moral values that they are trying to bring across to it audience and in the end it works out quite effectively. <br/><br/>The plot is very complicated (but it still very fun to watch nevertheless). The story is set in the year 2020 in England. In that time period England has been overruled by a regime that is fascist which had materialized by the paranoia caused by an influx of terrorist attacks. Freedom of expression and liberal ideologies are know obsolete and all information is in the hands of the government and if anyone has a problem with that will likely be gone and if you're a Muslim, well you can forget it. What stands out from all these other dystopia regimes is the stunning atmosphere. The England depicted here is like a hellish nightmare where it's hostility and fear is backed by fear and paranoia and the tension is quite isolating. The setting for this movie is filled with an engaging atmosphere, that's also quite exotic and even quite power-charged. The setting of this dystopia England has a unique ensemble of well-developed protagonists and antagonists, like the powerful, but ruthless High Chancelloe Adam Sutler (John Hurt) and the more if strangely sympathetic Chief Inspector Eric Finch (Stephen Rea) all the way to the film's leading heroes V (a brilliant Hugo Weaving) and Evey (Natalie Portman). All the characters were wonderfully drawn and the characterizations are the best that I have ever seen since ""Pulp Fiction"". And I'm glad they avoided any kind of character that would ruin the movie (right Jar-Jar Binks?) <br/><br/>The story itself centers around V's mission to go up against the tyranny that has been bestowed upon his country and we just want to root for him all the way. V is a very cool and endearing character. We may not always like the things he does to stand up against the empowered government. Sure his tactics are violent and not for the weak of heart, but we got to give the man credit; he has a lot of guts. As I mentioned before, this is a thinking person's movie. It gives us a thing to contemplate on, the way our government runs and to question ourselves and ask ourselves are we as free as we are lead to believe? Okay so I don't agree that killing another person is not the right way to go about fighting for freedom, but we as a society should ask how limited is our freedom? And as our society caves in will our freedom be more limited as the years roll on? <br/><br/>But make no bones about it ""V For Vendetta"" is high in terms of entertainment too. The plot is exhilarating that is high on thrills, unpredictability and filled with some subliminal revelations. The executions in the action scenes were quite thrilling and the dialogue is clever, witty and at times humorous in a philosophical point of view. On a technical sense the visuals are purely magical. In a nutshell, this movie is a cult classic."
"alex-vdbie","6","3","7","15 January 2013"," Cheering for the monster.
","This movie sports great atmosphere, great characters and an amazing plot. So why do I hate it with such passion? The answer is not that straightforward. <br/><br/>Let me start off with saying I did not read the graphic novel and have no opinion on it. I want to get around to reading it some day as I think there might be some answers in there about things that keep bugging me about the movie. However, I'll judge the movie on its own merits. Any movie should speak for itself. <br/><br/>Alright, on to the movie. So what is this movie about exactly? On the surface it seems to be about freedom from oppressive governments. However, that's not the whole story is it? The protagonist (at least I assume V is the protagonist) is a criminal and a terrorist. So... it's about morally gray stuff isn't it? <br/><br/>Well, that's where the problem comes in. The movie never goes into the gray vs. black debate. V is supposed to be our hero; the one who saves us all. But never in the entire movie does he do anything heroic. He blows stuff up and kills people. <br/><br/>Now, I don't want to give the impression that every movie is supposed to be about heroes and villains. I love the morally gray protagonists, going their own way, killing people until someone calls them on it. And there's my point with this movie. That moment doesn't come. V is just going on with his big plan and at the last moment, when he is almost discovered, we find out that the populace loves him and he is their hero. <br/><br/>Now, I understand that the government is evil and we are supposed to hate them (at least, in this movie). But never, in the entire movie, do I get the feeling that V is any better than them. <br/><br/>But maybe I'm going about this the wrong way. We are not really supposed to feel a bond with V. That's what Evey (Nathalie Portman) is for in this movie. She is the one who makes us feel anything here. She succeeds there partly. One place where she fails in my perspective is in making V any more human. Her vulnerability makes him into a monster. <br/><br/>So, what am I supposed to feel and think after all this? Am I supposed to feel that V is justified in his crusade, just because the people he's fighting are even worse? Am I supposed to lighten up about what he does? Frankly, this movie made me angry. Just because V is never called on the fact that he's a monster. <br/><br/>However, I am forced to give it a 6/10, just because of the fact that it is so very well made. I might hate this movie with a passion, but I can't deny the fact that this movie made me feel things and made me experience something."

","It is the year 2020. A virus runs wild in the world, most Americans are dead, and Britain is ruled by a fascist dictator who promises security but not freedom. One man stands against him, the man named V, who moves through London like a wraith despite the desperate efforts of the police. He wears a mask showing the face of Guy Fawkes, who in 1605 tried to blow up the houses of Parliament. On Nov. 5, the eve of Guy Fawkes Day, British schoolchildren for centuries have started bonfires to burn Fawkes in effigy. On this eve in 2020, V saves a young TV reporter named Evey from rape at the hands of the police, forces her to join him, and makes a busy night of it by blowing up the Old Bailey courtrooms.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" will follow his exploits for the next 12 months, until the night when he has vowed to strike a crushing blow against the dictatorship. We see a police state that hold citizens in an iron grip and yet is humiliated by a single man who seems impervious. The state tries to suppress knowledge of his deeds -- to spin a plausible explanation for the destruction of the Old Bailey, for example. But V commandeers the national television network to claim authorship of his deed.<br/><br/>This story was first told as a graphic novel written by Alan Moore and published in 1982 and 1983. Its hero plays altogether differently now, and yet, given the nature of the regime. is he a terrorist or a freedom fighter? Britain is ruled by a man named Sutler, who gives orders to his underlings from a wall-sized TV screen and seems the personification of Big Brother. And is: Sutler is played by John Hurt, who in fact played Winston Smith in ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"" (1984). (V seems more like Jack the Ripper, given his ability to move boldly in and out of areas the police think they control. The similarity may have come easily to Moore, whose graphic novel ""From Hell"" was about the Ripper, and inspired a good 2001 movie by the Hughes brothers.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" has been written and co-produced by the Wachowski brothers, Andy and Larry, whose ""Matrix"" movies also were about rebels holding out against a planetary system of control. This movie is more literary and less dominated by special effects (although there are plenty), and is filled with ideas that are all the more intriguing because we can't pin down the message. Is this movie a parable about 2006, a cautionary tale or a pure fantasy? It can be read many ways, as I will no doubt learn in endless e-mails.<br/><br/>The character of V and his relationship with Evey (Natalie Portman) inescapably reminds us of the Phantom of the Opera. V and the Phantom are both masked, move through subterranean spaces, control others through the leverage of their imaginations and have a score to settle. One difference, and it is an important one, is that V's facial disguise does not move (unlike, say, the faces of a Batman villain) but is a mask that always has the same smiling expression. Behind it is the actor Hugo Weaving, using his voice and body language to create a character, but I was reminded of my problem with Thomas the Tank Engine: If something talks, its lips should move.<br/><br/>Still, Portman's Evey has expressions enough for most purposes, as she morphs from a dutiful citizen to V's sympathizer, and the film is populated with a gallery of gifted character actors. In addition to Hurt as the sinister dictator, we see Stephen Rea and Rupert Graves as the police assigned to lead the search for V. Tim Pigott-Smith is an instrument of the dictator. These people exist in scenes designed to portray them as secure, until V sweeps in like a whirlwind, using martial arts, ingenious weapons and the element of surprise. Why the mask does not limit his peripheral vision is a question I will leave for the experts.<br/><br/>There are ideas in this film. The most pointed is V's belief: ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."" I am not sure V has it right; surely in the ideal state governments and their people should exist happily together. Fear in either direction must lead to violence. But V has a totalitarian state to overthrow, and only a year to do it in, and we watch as he improvises a revolution. He gets little support, although Stephen Fry plays a dissident TV host who criticizes the government at his peril.<br/><br/>With most action thrillers based on graphic novels, we simply watch the sound and light show. ""V for Vendetta,"" directed by James McTeigue, almost always has something going on that is actually interesting, inviting us to decode the character and plot and apply the message where we will. There are times when you think the soundtrack should be supplying ""Anarchy in the UK"" by the Sex Pistols. The movie ends with a violent act that left me, as a lover of London, intensely unhappy; surely V's enemy is human, not architectural.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic film and the drama is amazing. The actors couldn't be better."

","V (Hugo Weaving) lives in a dystopian British society of the near future. Terribly disfigured, he wears a Guy Fawkes mask at all times. Wronged long ago by a government agency, he is plotting his revenge. Evidentally, the United States is in chaos, having been a victim of nuclear warfare and plague. Some devious leaders of Britain vowed not to let that happen there. So, through deception and fear, a small party grabbed power. The Big Commissioner, Alan (John Hurt) rules with an iron fist and an iron heart. The curfew is early each evening, the telly has him giving speech after speech and he has a secret police called The Fingermen to enforce his rules. The chief of police, Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith) is just as evil. Also working for the government is Finch (Stephen Rea) who works in investigation. One night, Evey (Natalie Portman), a television news production underling, is supposed to pay an after-dark visit to one of the top telly brass. But, The Fingermen capture her and attempt a rape. V comes to her rescue, knocking off the bad guys with incredible weapon skills and martial arts. Very grateful, Evey agrees to go hear some music with V. BUT, what she thinks is a concert turns about to be a rooftop view to a demolition, set to the 1812 overture. After a major London building is destroyed, V comes on the telly to urge his fellow citizens to join him, one year from now, on Guy Fawkes Day to bring down the oppressive regime. Whew! At once, all of the leaders are out to capture him and thwart his plots. But, from an underground abode, he starts knocking off some of the rulers. Evey, fearful at first, comes to admire him greatly. But, since he is just one man, can he free the country from its totalitarian state? Its so unlikely yet V keeps winning. However, soon Evey is captured and undergoes torture to induce her to reveal V's residence. Will she break? Will V's brave efforts be for naught? How can I describe such a sensational movie as this? Yes, its quite violent in parts and owes a debt of gratitude to Orwell's 1984, The Count of Monte Cristo and other sources. Once a graphic novel, it also grapples with huge moral issues, such as to overthrow a corrupt nation, does the fighter become corrupt as well? Portman, complete with a British accent, is beautiful and touching while Weaving, with only a voice, does an incredible job as the title character. Hurt, too, is amazing, while Rea, Pigott-Smith, and all, all of the other cast members are admirable indeed. Then, too, the look of the film is breathtaking while the script and direction are brilliant to the end. In short, D for Don't MISS it, run now, buy it for your collection and put it on the shelf reserved for truly great movies."

","V for Vendetta is a dark and ominous warning to anyone with any sense of history who is paying attention to what is happening in the world today; history does have a way of repeating itself. With a great debt to George Orwell's 1984, the Wachowski brothers have spun an absolute masterpiece.<br/><br/>Britain is used as the country with complete media control, warning the public about protesters who are portrayed as enemies of the state.<br/><br/>""V"" is a masked rebel who travels throughout the land making great proclamations along the way. Hugo Weaving is the undercover hero and he is mesmerizing. He recruits Evey(Natalie Portman's best work, forget ""Black Swan""). Together, they use destructive tactics to awaken the public to the danger of the present fascist government. The great John Hurt is the nations leader and his face is on a big screen with his deep, important sounding baritone, alerting his citizens of the dangers of protest. The message here is important, and it is told in a way which is solidly entertaining. This is one of the best films ever made, a 10 out of 10."

","I had high expectations of this film, having seen the 8-rating on IMDb. And God, was I disappointed. A clumsy political message slapped onto a boom-and-bam action film. The suspense was, to say the least, boring. After 20 minutes of watching this movie, I didn't care who this masked-anti-hero was - he could be a grandmother from a state nursing home, for all I cared. The dialogue, lacking any subtlety or finesse, threw ham after ham at the audience. We are supposed to sympathise with this character for his political motives yet he tortures the female protagonist just the same, to prove a point; of course, for an unconvincing reason, she forgives him, and everything is dandy between them. Here lies another problem with the film: all the characters are two-dimensional. Before watching this movie, I advise you to consider whether its worth throwing away 2 hours of your time to watch a film that would bore even the people who produced it."
"christian_gil88","9","3","7","20 October 2008"," Superbly crafted and exciting drama of a bleak possible future
","Great Britain in the not too distant future. From the beginning of the film we are led to believe that the USA has collapsed, due to a plague and ensuing chaos and that the UK has become a totalitarian, repressive state. A combination of Hitlers's Third Reich and George Orwell's 1984. Terrifyingly realistic. (The character played implacably by John Hurt is the 'Chancellor', Adam Sutler  the references are obvious.) The story starts with a young woman being waylaid on the street at night, defying the curfew in place, and is rescued by a masked man, calling himself 'V'. She subsequently has an opportunity to repay the debt by helping him, and the story progresses from there. 'V' is a man with a single-minded mission  to destroy the machinery of the state and allow democracy to grab a chance. In a way, the tale, although well told and well acted, is only a useful metaphor for the real story  a warning of just how close we could be to the events depicted. Increasing control of people's lives, under the excuse of anti-terrorism and protection of the state, has led to a constant fear of being who you really are, if that means something other than what the State requires 'You wear a mask for so long, you forget who you were beneath it.' is a comment by the character played by Stephen Fry. Hugo Weaving is superb. His performance (in a Guy Fawkes mask the whole film) is all the more chilling for being understated and calm, (except when he's rescuing Natalie Portman or flashing knives around!) Despite not being able to see his face, his voice and body posture give us his character. Natalie Portman convinces with a stunning performance as a young woman who has been intimidated by the state for most of her life. The cinematography is also praiseworthy. Unlike some dark and disturbing films, which are shot in dark and disturbing colours (or near pitch black!) this is rendered in natural, if muted, tones and daylight is daylight and bright and stark corridors of hospitals, etc. are actually bright. This helps to make the scenes believable, real, adding to the chill. The ending is spectacular. To say more would spoil it for you. This is a splendid piece of work, and I believe, a very important film. It has rightly had a scattering of awards and nominations but Hollywood in its all-too-frequent parochial ignorance has thus far not seen fit to dish out an Oscar or two, whilst lavishing praise on a handful of over-hyped trash in recent years. If you haven't yet seen it  see it. It's the best movie I've seen in quite a while. And it makes you think."

","I was so afraid this film would just be more opportunistic betrayal of my political ideals, I avoided it for two years. Wow, was I ever mistaken! This is a great film in the classic tradition - there's nothing confusing or 'avant garde' here, this is straight-ahead unabashedly Romantic film-making, and the best of its kind I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Yes, V is a terrorist - and the film never pretends he's innocent, in any way; yes, what happens to the female lead is both morally and emotionally ambiguous. And yes, the 'right people' in the film make serious mistakes, and the 'bad people' actually have an understandable argument to make.<br/><br/>All this makes this film a thinking-person's adventure film. Nobody here is a puppet on anybody's string.<br/><br/>And the final question - which must remain with an audience not living in a fantasy - is, what does it really mean to be free? and what are we willing to do to accomplish that? Just by the way, although the film ends by playing the opening of the Rolling Stones' ""Street Fighting Man"", there are sly references throughout to the Sex Pistols' ""Anarchy in the UK"" - and the film knows this and earns the right to it, despite the total absence of ""punk"" in its visuals.<br/><br/>Easily the equal of ""Cyrano DeBergerac"" - a myth for the hell we currently pass through - highly recommended, to this generation and the next."

Stephen Fry plays her boss, a man with secrets of his own and the excellent John Hurt plays the Chancellor of England, the maniac behind the tyranny.<br/><br/>This film is bits of things like 1984, THX1138, The Island, Logans Run and other films about Dystopian futures.<br/><br/>There are no new ideas and the creators of The Matrix just generally rehash part of their own movie trilogy.

"hnapel","10","3","7","20 June 2006"," Meticulous consistency in a both physically and intellectually balanced plot.
","The reason this movie qualifies as a masterpiece can be attributed for a large part to its meticulous consistency in the details of the plot. Some will only be noticed if seen more than once, for example such small details as the scratch wound on Eveys forehead, how it gradually heals, the way in which Evey hides under the bed (and someone is seen dragged away as viewed from underneath it in a similar fashion) or when the woman in the TV broadcast does NOT blink when seen in another bulletin (and consequently must be speaking the truth). In other parallels (Evey raising her arms in the rain similar as to when V escaped Larkhill in fire) we are clearly guided by flashbacks, but that is justified as it strengthens the message to be conveyed. Some other comparisons are in fact morbidly hilarious if you come to think of them: V saying the forbidden art he keeps is least of his problems while Gordon Dietrich argues the other way around when also hiding Evey (and to his peril is proved ultimately right). V never taking off his mask may be perceived as annoying, but what else would the story have turned into, a happy ending 'as only celluloid can deliver' ? And it is also clearly explained by V himself in his overly elaborate manner; he's burnt, you've seen his hands and the rest is left to the imagination, again consistency.<br/><br/>This movie is as if composed like a musical piece, with a very big arc spanning from the beginning up to the very end, with smaller arches covering the sub plots, thus it has repetitions: the demolitions, the killings, parallels : Valerie vs. Evey, Guy Fawkes vs. V and to some extent even V vs. Chancellor Adam Sutler whose mask is the TV he ever hides behind. You may not agree with all I have noticed here, but isn't that the characteristic of true art, that everyone can see his own story and values in it? Also this movie avoids patronizing its viewers since there's no clear notion of good and bad in it, notice V to lie blatantly to Evey ('you will return home safely') and in turn Evey tries to betray V at her first opportunity, despite her vows. I will leave most of the larger political message and its implications to some of our modern societies to the reader, but save to say it's going to be hard to do away with it as entertainment only. Combined with strong individual performances, as the audience is both satisfied in its physical cravings with the full exposure of Evey (not to say Portman, as with this kind of acting, you would almost fear for the actress not escaping clear) during all her emotional transitions, that without the need of any sexual graphic at this point (the two attempted rapes seen earlier did not go unnoticed but also reveal no nudity) shows her deprivation from humanness during her confinement and the regain of it shortly afterward in the defining scene (losing fear) and at the same time the audience is intellectually challenged by the eloquence and subtle (but arguably at other times very violent) manners of V with his mesmerizing speeches, we have an altogether solidly balanced, captivating movie."

","The french say ""c'est le ton qui fait la musique"". And this plot is classical Greek comedy, very much in the form of commedia dell'arte. Rarely, if ever, in the past 10 years have I so much enjoyed a movie that is about as close to lyric as it can get. Not Cyrano, nor The Fifth Element, not even The Sixth Sense had the precision and grace this plot and its actors achieve. It all moves as lightly and easily as a cloud, looking completely effortless, one moment here, the next gone. Every stitch of it fits the rhythm set out in the beginning, with unflinching logic it leads you to the end. And what would this end be? Now What? ""and the rest, as they say, is history"".

","My daughter and I viewed this film a few days ago and found it quite enjoyable, although naturally, we don't agree entirely with V's politics and methods. That issue aside, the film really begs all of us to ask ourselves, how many of our rights and freedoms are we willing to surrender in the so-called name of maintaining peace and security?<br/><br/>The film also served as an educational vehicle for us, as not being British, we knew nothing about Guy Fawkes, and were thus motivated to conduct some online research concerning the man and his daring actions some 400 years ago.<br/><br/>One interesting observation we both made, is that in the classic movie ""1984"", John Hurt plays Winston Smith, a victim of the ""Big Brother"" totalitarian society of his day. In ""V For Vendetta"", Hurt takes the exact opposite role, and is in fact ""Big Brother"" himself -- High Chancellor Stutler.<br/><br/>In similar fashion, in another example of fine acting, Hugo Weaving does a role reversal as well from the earlier ""Matrix"" trilogy, where he played the cold, villainous, clear-talking Agent Smith, whose job it was to maintain order in the tyrannical cyber-world of the Matrix. In contrast, in ""V For Vendetta"", Weaving plays the colorful hero of the oppressed, who fights against the dictatorial world of a futuristic Great Britain.<br/><br/>Allow me to leave you with a bit of fun alliteration of my own. It took me about 15 minutes to compose this, and sounds like something that ""V"" himself may have said...although he really didn't:<br/><br/>""Some individuals invariably view the avenue of violent revolution as vulgar and vain; however, when the vile villains of democracy void the vote and vex the spirit of free men, others valiantly volunteer themselves; vowing to vanquish the evil inventions of such vituperious tyrants."""

","First of all, I would like to say that the movie is solid in the action scenes, dialogue, and superb acting. But the theme is so overplayed it brings the movie down two notches from the 8 I would have given it.<br/><br/>For anyone that actually follows the social and political control that a government can inflict on a people, nothing in this ""worst case scenario"" movie brings anything new to the table. Aspects of fear and power have been done countless times in other movies. From Nazi war movies to Aeon Flux, the idea of a evil government taking over never seems to get old, at least for the average movie goer. But for anyone that actually follows real world history and politics, this movie has nothing new to bring. Not only are the ideas old, but the writers have a very clear agenda, implying --if not outright claiming-- that the current British and American governments are the spawn of an evil empire, waiting to grow into something horrible that will equal Nazism. Mix that with strong anti-religious statements (some warranted, some just plain false) and you have yourself a ""marvelous cutting edge achievement"" to the average laymen, but a boring and shallow interpretation of government to anyone that has committed any of their time to following history and governments.<br/><br/>Dare I even speak about how the movie is obviously against the war in Iraq. Despite that fact that V kills countless people, blows up buildings, and fights a battle to try to free thousands of oppressed people, the movie implies that the war in Iraq is wrong because we are killing countless people, blowing up buildings, and fighting a battle trying to free thousands of oppressed people.<br/><br/>The only reason I am talking about the theme so much is that without it, the plot is worthless. The storyline is entertaining at best, but definitely not able to stand up against some of the more creative movies currently out there.<br/><br/>Overall, the acting, action, and scenery are all top notch.

","For a movie that supposedly costs $50M to make - it had a low-budget feel to it - e.g. the movie consistently used the same group of extras to portray the reactions of the hoi polloi in the ""V"" universe - this is simply lazy and unpolished movie making; what little of the special effects used in the movie were of the run-of-the-mill variety. As for action sequences - they were mainly confined to a brief sequence near the end. As action sequences go, one can easily find lower budget HK kungfu movies that will deliver significantly more punch (pun intended). The storyline - adapted from a comicbook novel - was ordinary and nowhere near the epiphany-inducing, mind-blowing, jaw-dropping experiences documented by many reviewers. As a whole, the movie does not live up to its 8+ rating in IMDb. At best a 5/10..."

"Robert_duder","9","3","7","7 April 2006"," An amazing and controversial piece of film!!
","First off I want to say that I am really honestly shocked that this film got made. Parts of this film and story were some of the most controversial and perhaps politically charged scenes I have ever seen especially in an entirely fictional sci-fi action film. There a very powerful and debatable message to V For Vendetta that leaves you thinking about the morals and story long after it ends. Finally the supposedly multi-talented Wachowski brothers can add something of real sustenance to their resume. The Matrix (the original film) was brilliant and well made and spawned an amazing story and world but I was severely disenchanted with anything the Wachowski brothers would do after the poorly done sequels but certainly V For Vendetta turns that around. James McTeigue, a Wachowski lackey and newcomer director creates a brilliant political and dark world of futuristic terror and revolution.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman delivers one of her most brilliant and important roles as Evey, a young woman, the daughter of revolutionaries trying to just live her life until she has a run in with a very mysterious masked man known only as V. Portman as Evey goes through such a powerful transformation. She reflects the changes in their society and the rebirth or awakening of a nation. Her performance is breath taking and riveting and she should be given great acclaim in this role. Equally as powerful is Huge Weaving as the masked anti-hero V. Weaving is best known as none other than infamous bad guy Agent Smith which I didn't realize until after the film was over. You won't recognize him or his voice but he does an incredible job. Through the guise of a mask he still creates this dark, deadly, emotional figure that you feel terror, pity, sadness and love for all at once. Is V a hero?? Well that's really the ultimate question behind this film. In essence V is a terrorist, in some ways he is no different than the extremist terrorists we known nowadays going beyond the normality of battles to fight for their causes. Stephen Rea is also brilliant as the disillusioned detective who investigates V's murders across London but slowly begins to realize there is more to his world than he ever knew. John Hurt and Tim Pigott-Smith both make very evil and real world dictators of the new world ravaged by disease and wars.<br/><br/>V For Vendetta clearly lays out the world before this revolution without getting into too much detail. By using subtle characters, and news flashes we get a very real sense of the world, enough to easily take a position on the revolution unfolding. The film is entirely fictional and brutal in it's action and gore and yet one of the most political and intelligent films I have seen this year. This man was tortured by the system, abused by the government and now sets out to exact revenge for not only himself but the rest of the world as well...for people like his new ally Evey, her parents, his cell mate, everyone. In that way he is a hero and a revolutionary but are his tactics terrorist?? The question still haunts me...is he right or wrong in his ways?? Regardless he is a brutal enemy to be up against with his incredible sword play and martial arts and makes short work of everyone. Evey and V have great chemistry and you feel a devotion and love between them. In many ways the story could be compared to Phantom of The Opera, a masked man, scorned by society falls in love with a woman he can never be with. No matter how you look at it Vendetta is one of the best films of the year to date and I would love to think they might serialize this although Wachowski brothers have disappointed with sequels before. I think there is much more of a back story to be told here. Action, political, drama, romance and an intense story...this is definitely worth seeing, a great movie for grown ups that is a legitimate intelligent action film. 9/10"
"maryuna","9","3","7","6 April 2006"," Very good movie
","Well, I must say that I am not a fan of science fictions, or any kind of ""rediculous"" movies, such as things happening in the future, super hero, and such. I actually fell asleep while watching Sin City, and I had never liked Matrix...Anyway, my friend dragged me to this one. But, I loved it! It's a great movie.<br/><br/>I think the best things are the ideas behind it. Like V said in the end, ideas are bullet-proof. You can kill a man, you can kill a family, you can kill a generation, but you cannot kill an idea. The idea of being free, and equal,to respect other people's choices (as long these choices don't harm anyone), and being respected for our own choices ---these ideas can never die. People will fight for them, if they are being threatened.<br/><br/>Of course, I gave it 9 instead of 10, because still, to some extend, it is unreal. Like how V managed to ship so many masks into the city? Who made these masks...sorry, I am just not the kind of person to believe in supernatural power.<br/><br/>But still, when the whole city put on the masks and marched out for Nov. 5th, I was moved. I thought: who cares where he got those masks, and how he shipped it? Just get out, and celebrate the night."

","I found this movie to be pretty boring and the dialogue full of nonsense. You find less talk in a courthouse drama.<br/><br/>The world did not seem futuristic at all. I find it pretty stupid that the same cars and LCD-displays (manufactured by Dell) to name a few, that are in use today, looked like they were brand new in 2019.<br/><br/>The film had much less action that i hoped for. Good dialogue would have helped the situation, but i found the dialogue to be very weird and full of quotes from some old English plays. It felt like some weird wannabe artistic crap. It completely lacked any tension.<br/><br/>And the ending with thousands of V:s that all had perfect clothing and line-up...please. <br/><br/>The only good things in the film were the ""funny"" pedophile priest, the final fight and Hugo Weaving as V.<br/><br/>Anything that has the name Wachowski in it has sucked after the superb first Matrix movie.<br/><br/>5/10"

I have not seen a film this exciting and amazing since the Lord of the Rings series, and that's saying a lot for me. I will definitely be purchasing this film on release day and I advise that anyone that loves movies GO SEE THIS. The message this film delivers is very powerful and every one of us should be thankful for any and all freedoms we are given. Natalie Portman gave a very convincing performance in my opinion and I think she pulled off a fairly decent English accent. Hugo Weaving had the PERFECT voice for this role and I love all of his other work. There are many parts of the movie that will remind one of ""The Matrix"", especially some effects, but it has not been overdone. This film is a masterpiece on many different levels and should be much higher on the list of Best Movies Ever Made."

Natalie Portman is also perfect in her role and really proves that she was completely devoted to this project. Great cast all-around as well. V for Vendetta jumps off to a great start right away and doesn't leave the audience waiting for exciting scenes. Strong violence maybe a little too much for people with weak stomachs, but fight scenes are memorable. Brilliant acting, great plot, and amazing effects.

I watched the movie and enjoyed the every bit of it. Movie start with a dialogue "" Remember the idea not the man because man can fail, he may be caught, he can be killed and forgotten but four hundred years later an idea can still change the world"" A must watch movie.

","This movie was amazing. There are significant differences from the graphic novel that it is based off of however, I enjoyed it very much. V for Vendetta shows a mark of the Wachowski brothers without being exactly the same as the Matrix. It has a definite style that worked very well. As far as the acting in the film went, I thought Natalie Portman (who I am usually very skeptic of) did a wonderful job, as well as Hugo Weaving whom I have the utmost confidence in. The supporting cast was also excellent. Otherwise, besides a very few details that detract from the main plot I can not find anything to criticize in this movie.<br/><br/>As a side note I would like to say that if you enjoyed this movie you should take time to research Guy Fawkes and ""The Gunpowder Plot""."

It was also kind of scary thinking what England would be like in 30 years time or whatever. Although It was kind of funny how V just did anything like blowing up these big buildings whilst listening to this classical music. Brilliant ! I'm into all kinds of films really especially science fiction and is a definite must see this year. The one downfall was that you didn't get to see his face !

","We all know the way Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror and Comedies are treated by the Yearly academy awards. Who doesn't remember the way they treated the Lord of the Rings-Trilogy? <br/><br/>But this year they can't, they are not allowed to overlook this movie.if they do, I suggest someone with a lot of money goes to court to get all members of the academy fired.<br/><br/>I wanted to watch two movies today, V for Vendetta at noon and another one, around4 o'clock. But the moment I left the theater I was walking on eggs, on air, or whatever words I can use to describe my feelings... They probably will never explain the way I felt watching this movie and leaving the theater.<br/><br/>I felt profound, impressed, swept of my feet. The past years I haven't had any movie touch me so much like this one. Even though there are minor moments in the movie that I didn't like. But really, I wouldn't easily give 10 points, but I do this time. The performance by Natalie Portman shows us (again) that she can do much better than playing a nice beautiful princess in Star Wars. She is one of those (few) young faces on the white screen that are on their way to become a screen legend, a screen diva. She made shivers go down my spine.<br/><br/>But I can't say there was one actor or actress in this movie that didn't show the audience that they had talent and that their talent was why they were chosen to be a part of this movie.<br/><br/>Again, I can keep on writing, but with a lack of words to give the cast the honor they deserve, I better send my warning again to the Academy (bafta and others too) : DON'T you DARE to overlook this movie !!!"
"Polaris_DiB","6","3","7","30 March 2006"," Many things to amaze and stun, but it's the character(s) that count
","In this rather colorful and clean (albeit darkly lit) futuristic British world, a fascist government has taken control. And since we don't like fascists, we need a very colorfully masked character to save us all from being mindless sheep. He also is wonderfully poetic, too, making him more than just a zealous terrorist: he's an artist.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving is, frankly, amazing. Not only does he have to overcome his (basically) typecast nature (who really saw him as Elrond in The Lord of the Rings? No, everyone saw him as Mr. Smith posing as a zealous elf), but he has to do so without a face. His voice acting is one thing, but its the pantomime that matches the voice acting that gives this character its compelling nature. He's graceful, and poetic, and artistic, and swashbuckling... and straight out of silent film, despite his ""verbose"" dialog. That is why when he does stuff like pretending to be strangled by an empty suit of armor or speak an entire paragraph with words starting only with V, it actually works. No seriously, it's brilliant.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman supports well, but none more so real than when she's really put into a testy situation. She moves from fear to chaos to acceptance to love in a moments notice, exactly the way the audience wants to move with her. Despite V's rather straightforward narration of events, it's at Evey's speed that we try to alternatively catch up and slow down to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>And finally, Stephen Rea. Wow, what a perfect choice for that role. Now the movie mentions that he's Irish (and we all know what that means to England and it's ideals of status quo), but it barely even needs to. Not only is Rea's nationality perfect for the part, but the way he's proved himself through such films as The Crying Game really endear us to the guy who is suddenly shocked out of the status quo... and is now in the position to make a major decision about whether to reject or accept this sudden change. If anyone should be given credit for this film's success, it's the casting director.<br/><br/>Now the story is a ""pretty good one"", though it's really engaging mostly through its in-depth explorations of its characters. I haven't read the graphic novel. I've read enough vitrolic rants about this movie to understand that it gets nowhere near the depth of these characters as presented in the original work. But unlike such adaptations as our infamous Harry potter series and the like, this movie does have a certain care and understanding for the characters, doing the best it can to really give them lives and histories... and sidestories. In fact, it felt like this movie could go on forever, and that even if it did, I wouldn't have minded.<br/><br/>I think there's two major places the story fails to make this film from good to really great. The first is that some of the dialog just simply doesn't hold up to some of the other dialog... V's lines are great (though I understand they are much better in the original work), but stuff like the policemen's constant repetition about coincidences doesn't hold up well.<br/><br/>Secondly, at first it's really unclear why exactly the government we're watching is evil (except with the usual Big Talking Head that always makes us think of Big Brother), then even when it's cleared up, it's hard to understand why the subjects are so ready and willing to jump on the V bandwagon and practice ""Anarchy in the UK!"" (By the way, was that line necessary either? I think this movie had enough trouble from the beginning without having to sound like a stupid punk who doesn't realize the 70s ended more than a quarter of a century ago). <br/><br/>However, that's not to say that this film isn't full of some really strong points. I think what did it for me was the comedy show featuring the Grand Chancellor being humiliated. Both as a loving homage to British humor past and present, and as a thumbs up to satire and the power of daring media, it's a grand addition to the preceedings. The comedian's subsequent arrest places it into a morbid theme: you can't just talk about it or joke about it. You have to act to change it. Hint to the left, in case they're wondering why their ""Impeach Bush"" stickers aren't doing anything.<br/><br/>And about the politics, since it's such a big issue. This movie is very stunted in that it uses discourses we use today, and the Wachowskis are obviously very intent in putting a bit of Bush-bashing into it. It wasn't very necessary, but it worked out in places like the little quip about the Avian flu and whatnot. Personally, I could have used a much broader and somewhat universally-themed approach, especially since this film seems to be almost begging in parts for the Right to get angry at it so that it could get some free publicity.<br/><br/>That said, despite all these things here, all these things here which weren't quite good enough to have me absolutely raving about it, I can't help but really love it for those characters. I think what appeals most about V is that not only is his mask just a wonderfully distinct image, but he has absolute control over a world where power seems to be utterly lacking. I especially love that last fight scene he does at the end with the vapor-trails around the knives. I've heard a lot of scoffing about how that's just pointless bullet-time, but it isn't bullet time. It's V's utter, almost mystical, control over the elements and the energy around him right as he's about to kick some serious booty. I think that's a great way of turning the Wachowski's self-created image into something entirely new.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"fuekewl","10","3","7","30 March 2006"," Modern-day classic. Best movie since Fight Club.
","I watched this movie last night, afterward realizing that it may have been the single best movie I had seen the entire year. The balance of narrative, cinematography, score and acting provide an enjoyable path of escapism for your discerning moviegoer.<br/><br/>At the same time, it offers a great amount of introspection on how we are influenced by the mainstream media and its hidden political agendas. It is an extrapolation of how democracy becomes totalitarian, where unquestioned fear keeps the populous sedated and where repression of truth keeps the corrupt in power. It is an allegory that serves as a cautionary yardstick which we must measure our own world governments by.<br/><br/>The ensemble of a talented cast, each playing a flawed three-dimensional character with enough nuance, enhanced the believability of the tale.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman portrayed Evey Hammond with aplomb. I likened her to a naive caterpillar initially weakened by the fear of non-conformance. Meeting V, whose daunting, methodical obsession for retribution and revolution becomes the catalyst that transforms Evey into a fearless butterfly, unchained from the yoke of fraudulent terror and guarded oppression.<br/><br/>Hugh Weaving's portrayal of the intelligent, calculating, almost-deranged, brutally-detached, self-sacrificing, mutated superhuman character of V was superb. Not for one moment did the Guy Fawkes's mask hinder Hugh's ability to convey the expressions and emotions of the character. With elegant delivery of poetic, thought-provoking monologues, I could think of no better actor.<br/><br/>The adaptation from graphic novel to movie was as good as it gets, given the current political climate we face ourselves in. Director James McTeigue presents a movie that does not employ over-the-top bullet-time fight sequences without justification. When it is employed, it is in such a benign fashion that it compliments the expectation of the audience. All elements combine to make this movie a modern-day classic, that will not simply be dated by its the hair-styles, make-up and clothes worn.<br/><br/>Why its creator, Alan Moore, distanced himself from the movie is an enigma. Maybe true to form and true to his revolutionary protagonist, V, he's action serves to offer credibility to the significance of his work, remaining the neutral, non-conformist opposing the politicized mainstream media conglomerates.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it remains a movie that does not detract from its original overarching message of hope beyond the real fear and freedom beyond the unseen tyranny.<br/><br/>If you are still unconvinced, go see it just for the mere fact that this movie, charged with so many political overtones, has actually been made.<br/><br/>10/10 for sure!"

","It's been a long time since I read this graphic novel. I am aware that the author wasn't particularly happy with the way Hollywood treated his material but I have to say I felt this was an inspired piece of work. I'm not interested in the 'fanboy response' to how Alan Moore's work was treated, the script was true enough to his vision to get the important message across. Anything that can invoke the sort of dialogue I heard coming out of the cinema tonight can only be a good thing. Voter apathy/ignorance is the main reason the Americans have Bush as President, it's also the reason that the UK is America's lapdog at this time. This movie isn't a work of art, nor is it a particularly profound piece. However, what it IS is a wake up call for anyone who has lost interest in their Government's activity. I'm no activist but if ever there comes a time when the prevailing corruption and misinformation we're experiencing now comes to a head, as it does in THIS vision of dystopia, then I'll be the first to join the 'resistance'.

I walked out amazed, enlightened, and best of all, thinking. <br/><br/>This movie, unlike most movies you see today, succeeds because it completely ignores the plan for a successful film. The hero is not handsome(courtesy of burns and a mask), the female lead isn't brave, the hero is a terrorist, and the romance is so subtle that it leaves you wondering ""what really went on between them?"" Few movies give you eloquence ad violence, sci-fi and history, without failing miserably in the process. This one does. It spans every audience. It's so deep that one could talk about every minute detail for hours upon weeks, yet the surface plot is entertaining enough to pull in those who may not care for the philosophical tones.<br/><br/>Save for the violence (primarily the beatings ad V's holycrapcool knife skills, which may disturb sensitive or young viewers), I see this film as one that anyone could go to and get something out of.<br/><br/>Hollywood, THIS is what you should strive for."

The main themes were civil liberties and how hope can set you free. I loved the music. The special effects were extremely realistic. I feel that the final action sequence could have used a little less slow motion. Other than that, the middle was pretty slow and I recommend that you rent it not buy/watch it in the theater. 8-10 for effects/statement."

","I saw V for V two days ago and still find myself spellbound - by all of its elements and how freshly and interestingly and movingly they were put together.<br/><br/>For a ""futuristic"" movie, there was zero tired technological razzle-dazzle (lots of points for that alone!) It was instead quite consciously old-fashioned and elemental.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving created an unbelievably complex and magnificent hero for the age and the ages, with only his voice and his moves, an accomplishment nothing short of incredible. He literally makes your eyes forget the mask they're seeing and forces your brain into a depth of imagination that people haven't had to do since the days of radio dramas.<br/><br/>V's combination of kickass physicality, literary erudition, and general panache reminded me a lot of Cyrano de Bergerac - another heroic figure who had to hide himself.<br/><br/>I was hooked, shocked, and totally into the ride from the Old Bailey blowup. That scene did a great job of making us all Evie in an instant. Beautiful use of music throughout btw.<br/><br/>Just awesome. Its digressions were more interesting than most movies' points. Its flaws were obvious and forgivable.<br/><br/>The most in-your-face Bush regime parallel - all the repressive-infrastructure things that had the motto ""for your own protection"" on them.<br/><br/>It was also a truly lovely romance on more than one level. I didn't like how they wrecked the elegance of the less-is-more between V and Evie with his soap-opera confession of love in the train station - but her kissing the mask - which should have been hokey - was heartbreaking and real.<br/><br/>LOVED IT. Could go on and on. Will see it at least one more time and probably more. So glad I saw it on the big screen.<br/><br/>I wonder how many of the negative reviews here are from actually seeing the movie as opposed to dutifully parroting right wing radio talking points."

","I am new to the V for Vendetta world , but am absolutely in love with it. I have read Alan Moore's graphic novel and thought it was wonderful. The movie complimented the novel superbly and was not at all a sell-out. Why Alan Moore took his name off the credits is a mystery to me! The directors displayed fully the world of V for Vendetta and the actors captured the characters wonderfully. This indeed was not your run-of-the-mill movie. With deeper meaning and powerful messages, one is not sitting in a dark movie theater like a brainless zombie, but rather is contemplating all that the directors, actors, and producers have so elegantly thrown into our popcorn buckets like savory raisinettes. I have seen the movie twice and I know that I will have to watch it at least once more to truly appreciate the extent of its message. There is so much that one could miss that must be appreciated.As a younger person I found this movie to reflect on what I believe and was glad that for once a movie could truly do that."

","The positive: An action movie that has a story, smart dialogue and a compelling characters. They kept the poetry of V's speech. The story of Valerie is the soul, the true idea of the v of vendetta story. The fact that V does in fact die and that chaos (the destruction of Parliment) still happens. In a traditional film the cop would have published the doctor's diary and the bad guys would have been brought down in public. The reality is that sometimes justice is brutal and that the bad guys are often brought down only at the expense of innocent lives.<br/><br/>natalie portman is insanely appealing and attractive. Her transformation was believable.<br/><br/>The Negative The romance story between V and Evey was totally wrong. V is not a man, he is an idea. As a man he is focused on one thing, personal anarchy. The whole romance is unbelievable and totally against the theme of the story.<br/><br/>The bad guys were too bad, there was no moral gray which is more true of true believers. Having the woman of course be the only one with regret is such an American movie convention.<br/><br/>While it worked to set it in the current context of ""terrorism"" as excuse to take away civil liberties the original story was about anarchism not about liberal politics vs conservative politics."

","V for Vendetta is a movie that pulls no punches. A killer cast, stunning visuals,top-notch music and a story that could very well happen if some of it isn't happening or taking place soon. I think the observation that it glorifies terrorists is too knee-jerk. Because it goes to more of an idea not a single act of violence. It is the best new film so far of 2006!John Hurt is diabolical as the ruler of Britain. Hugo Weaving is nothing short of spectacular since it is done behind a mask. Natalie Portman gives her best performance to-date of the troubled Evey. Also the shadowy Chaney-like figure is chilling. These performances as well as the director should get Oscar nods. This is risky film making(for a big budget film). I'm surprised that there aren't more objections to this film from right-wing conservatives."

","I saw V for Vendetta the other night and thought it was OK, It's nowhere near the 8.2 rating that the fanbois have currently given it.<br/><br/>I won't pick holes with the script and it's deviations from the Graphic Novel. I understand that the media is different and the story should be told in different ways, I'll just comment directly on the film.<br/><br/>Some of the acting was good, some not so. The script jumped around a lot, leaving lots of unanswered holes (a Warchowski Brother trademark I think). Of the 5 of us who went in together, the 3 who had not read Alan Moores graphic novel came out looking bemused asking what was going on there questions. For the first few lines delivered by V, he was almost incomprehensible. Mostly I think V came across as too pantomime, and nowhere near sinister enough, this could been helped by much better direction and camera work. Natalie Portman did a good job in places, but I think was found a bit lacking in places (torture scenes and revelations), and she obviously needed more time with a voice coach for her accent.<br/><br/>Parts of the plot are highly dubious, just where did V get thousands of masks from with no-one knowing, what happened to all those ""Revolutionaries"" when the train was sent in? What do the masses have to look to at the end? How does V get into all those secure places in such a paranoid country? I think that the pace of the film media doesn't lend itself particularly well to a story spanning a year, and this lead to problems in the film.<br/><br/>All in all, I did quite enjoy the film, and I would sit through it again. I'm glad I kind of knew the plot before I went in (through reading the novel years ago) as I think it helped gloss over the now what's going on bits.<br/><br/>Roll on the special, extended, directors cut - Now approved by Alan Moore....

","Remember, remember the 5th of November. A day when revolution and freedom find its way back into the people. And a day when an action movie is made with a compelling story line and great acting, not relying solely on visual razzle-dazzle.<br/><br/>Remember, this daring story was written by the wonderful Wachowski brothers (The Matrix), so every now and then you do want to ask someone in the theatre, ""does anyone know what the hell is going on?"" As in the Matrix, I was having a great time riding on the energetic roller-coaster ride V offers, but often found myself as confused as a 16 year old smoking pot for the first time.<br/><br/>That aside, the story is crisp, deep, and very motivating to the revolutionary rebel inside all of us.<br/><br/>Taking place in the near future where Germany won World War II, Europe has become the dominating world power through a totalitarian government. One masked marauder, named V, mysteriously uses terrorist tactics to rally the people to stand up to their fear-inducing government. But where and how did V come about? Is his coming a coincidence or was he a domino piece in a long line of things happening for a reason? The Wachowski brothers did an excellent job of designing V as a viable and provocative character, yet leaving just enough out so that the audience could answer the former questions. For the first time in a ""superhero"" movie, I actually wanted to see who was under the mask. Natalie Portman also delivers on all levels as the daughter of a revolutionary writer who was taken by the police, along with her mother, and never seen again.<br/><br/>The action scenes were pulled off very Matrix-like. Trails followed behind slow-mo moving knives that, thanks to the extremely loud sound effects that accompanied every shot of his blades, were more likely to deafen V's victims than kill them. With that I say thank you filmmakers for putting more focus into the plot! Yes, it is possible Hollywood.<br/><br/>V is a courageous and bold movie, delivered by tight direction, great dialogue, and an engaging story. It is more than a political statement, it is a warning of how things could have been or could be. And you have one fun time being warned."
"The_Factor","10","3","7","21 March 2006"," Extraordinary Film
","I found V to be an exceptional film for several reasons. First it was unconventionally entertaining. The film is set in the not-too-distant future, some years after a devastating war has changed the Geo-Political climate of England to that of a fascist state. There are those who secretly oppose their government's excessive control of individual rights and freedoms. However there is one who begins to champion those rights -- V. V is played with exquisite eccentricity, while Evey's role was more subtle yet sublime. The supporting cast was on point as well. The action, though robust, was not overwhelming. Though politically charged -- it was not nuanced with propaganda. This film challenged the viewer to examine the notions of liberty, power and loyalty and by what means would some go to protect those values -- and to what end.<br/><br/>Great Film"

Unfortunately, I went to the last showing of the evening for this movie, if there was another showing I would've gotten back in line and immediately viewed it again. So brilliant I was angry when it was over. Hugo Weaving, as V, is amazing in every respect, when he quotes Shakespeare, among other great writers, he delivers lines so perfectly, and in a context that is also perfect for each reference.

","It's a great film. It's not a masterpiece of cinema though. But it's a movie about ideas and it's a movie about people moved by them. It points a stern finger at the politicians of today, a reminder that their constituents are not sheep nor lemmings. What little action appears in the film is overshadowed by its premise: the idea of freedom, and how one man allows people to remember what freedom is.<br/><br/>Scariest part of the film: the trucks driving the streets listening and recording conversations in homes. We already have illegal wiretapping, the government asking for access to emails and what should be private records, our personal information being shared by corporate entities for their own profit. Fear is instilled in the hearts of the populace as avian bird flu scares, terrorist attacks that were narrowly avoided, epidemic outbreaks where only the government has the vaccine appear in the government-controlled media.<br/><br/>We need to be certain that, above all else, freedom of the press is assured. It's easy to control the masses when the press are telling you believable lies.<br/><br/>When we finally wake up and decide to say, ""Enough is enough...you have taken too much!"" it may be the day you're ""black-bagged"" because a neighbor ratted you out.

","I saw this movie yesterday (after reading the graphic novel two months before)with the idea that nothing would surprise me since I had read the graphic novel. Well I was dead wrong, let me tell you. Very rarely does the film adaptation of a work of literature surpass its original content, but this did. The content Mcteigue added to the film from the graphic novel improves on Allan Moore's(the author of V for Vendetta) original vision. Moore even says in the preface to ""V for Vendetta"" that he wrote V for Vendetta when he was younger and less experienced, and thus there are flaws in his work. The film adaptation fixes those flaws and makes the whole ""V"" experience better. Hugo Weaving did a perfect job bringing the character of V to life, and Natalie Portman does a fine job as Evey Hammond as well. This movie was the best!"

It was like The Phantom of The Opera meets 1984 meets Fareneit 451. The government censorship of England shows how important our rights are.

"KingAtor42","7","3","7","19 March 2006"," Enjoyable But Also Flawed
","I would have to say that V For Vendetta (VFV) was an enjoyable film it was also one that was not an easy task to take on. For starters, the comic book is extremely political and deep and despite the fact that it has been around for quite a while, is still very potent. Its message almost represents current times with the Patriot Act, wiretapping, Guantanamo Bay and public terrorism trials right in our faces. But the fact remains is that it was a piece of work built around political overtones as well as a very deep question which the movie fails to provide enough material for us to investigate.<br/><br/>You would like to watch the movie and wonder: Is V a terrorist or is he a patriot? Is there actually a justification for his murderous rampages and body count? Even if you think he has the political agenda to and he is a patriot, does he as a person have the right to murder all of the people involved in his creation? Especially those who were repentant of their crimes towards him openly? While this is not a fast paced movie, it is too swiftly paced and superficial to give us enough material to answer these questions if not only to debate them. The comic was written in the hopes of bringing about that debate as to whether he was mad or just a patriot and what qualifies as a terrorist. In the efforts of making the film more easily digestible for the average fan and more action-based, it sacrificed good quality for extra popularity.<br/><br/>To these ends I can only say that the film was enjoyable and entertaining but it really lacked in bringing up that all important debate. What made the comic memorable was that question. A simple inclusion of some well thought conversation and investigations into the mind of V would easily have made this a solid 8.5 vs. 9 debate because it's such a solid adaptation. What I'm most happy about is that it avoided fully selling out by involving some stupid back-story or including far too much Matrix-Reloaded like action sequences. The action sequences were tastefully done and despite some clearly Waschowski brothers' effects at the end, were very good.<br/><br/>I'm just to troubled about what the story never answers. There wasn't enough justification for Natalie Portman's decisions and character transformations, what V's agenda was based upon deep down, and also why the government agents make the final decisions that they make. Overally though this film hints at a great 1984 like setup, with many homages, but lacks in the depth that 1984 had by adding in some flashy action sequences instead of some good debate material."

","I just saw this film and all my friend and I could say is Wow. After I got over how amazing the film was (which took more than a few minutes) I asked myself why I thought it was so good. Performances were solid from every cast member. Natalie Portman was nothing short of amazing. Her transformation of character from the beginning to the end of the film was brilliant. Hugo Weaving as 'V' was also surprising. Because of the mask, all of his acting is done physically and with the voice. His performance was some of the best mask acting work I have ever seen (professional actors and acting teachers especially can appreciate the mask work). Not only did I understand his reasoning, but also even with the mask on, I was emotionally connected to him. This is partly due his performance, and partly due to the amazing writing. If you liked The Matrix Trilogy or have a love of politics or philosophy, see this film. Not only is this a great film, but also you will walk away thinking."

","Wow. That was my first thought after seeing ""V for Vendetta"". This movie something for everyone. To interest those who enjoy shoot-'em-up movies like ""Bond"" and ""The Matrix"", there is no shortage of action. Brilliantly choreographed fight scenes and amazing cinematography make for compelling fight scenes that are both interesting and unique. For those who enjoy movies that make them think, there is no shortage of issues to mull over. The movie takes place in a post-modern world where the US has crumbled into decay over it's war on terror. Great Britain, who has been targeted by terrorists for its support of the US, has turned to a religious, authoritarian government to protect them. The conservative government has banned homosexuals, outlawed Islam, enforced curfews on it's people, abducted citizens for speaking out, and taken control of the media. Needless to say, all of these are issues which are hotly contested with today's White House regime.<br/><br/>The story that follows contains wit (with quotes from Shakespeare and Dickens) and imagination. It challenges the audience to go out and make sure that ""People should not be afraid of their governments, governments should be afraid of their people"". Oh, and it leaves feeling like you want to blow up a building... But that could be the special effects."
"axopnk","10","3","7","19 March 2006"," Excellent movie
","Excellent films like this don't come around often. I have to say that i rank this as another ""sleeper hit"" movie, similar to Batman Begins. Let me say that the end results is equally satisfying as batman begins. I have never read the comics or known anything of this series until i watched this movie. I must say that this movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat, mixing a perfect amount of action, politics, story, background etc. <br/><br/>I think one of the greatest assets of this movie is the after effect. You feel like becoming involved in your community, politics, or basically just making a change in our world. It gives you a special kind of satisfaction that one man or ideal can make a difference. Even if you don't feel these incentives, you definitely will learn something out of the experience. Specficially you probably want to investigate or search for more background information about the movie or comics, and this even leads to a little history lesson about who Guy Fawlkes was. There is a lot of underlying messages in this movie, which i will not get into because they are different for different people (deals wtih the past and present political issues). Anyways on to the cast. <br/><br/>First off i have to give proper credit to the wachisoki brothers, i have to admit i didn't except them to do such a excellent job (come on, the last matrix's weren't exactly grade A material like the first one), so for them to do such a great accomplish deserves credit. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman was stunning as ever, in both talent and looks (She can still shave her head and look good). Her acting was top notch, and really brought the character of Evey to light. This definitely was another one of her greater actress talent movies compared to her Queen amidala days. A lot may wonder why they didn't choose Kira knightly seeing shes already British. For me i believe Portman is a much more established and experienced actress than Kira, but who knows, Kira Knightly is definitely on the rise. Evey's character was refreshing and also was not so one dimensional like queen amidala. Evey had to deal with a lot of her own issues which i thought was very realistic. <br/><br/>V was awesome in all respects. He was intelligent, smart, funny at times, and plain bad ass when i came to fighting. Evey moment he was on the screen he was intriguing and mysterious. You wanted to keep watching to find out any more information of V, he's ultimate purpose, his motives, intents etc. A lot of questions were definitely answered in the movie, which kept you satisfied. But, as stated before, after the movie you probably will try to get more information on the story itself as well as V. I think the greatest aspect of V is that he gave the audience both an ideal or represented a symbol but yet still gave the satisfaction of action. <br/><br/>The detective (Finch) was excellent in this story, and also was not a one dimensional character. Evey person in the movie, whether good or bad had to make their own decisions and deal with their own issues before taking action. The dictator was very menacing, and the whole society felt very dark and real (like batman begins) which really gave it a realistic feel and something that all of us could relate to (due to our past convictions and fear of the future). <br/><br/>As stated before, a lot of issues were in this movie that even deal with current issues of today that could lead to a part of tomorrow. Overall this is definitely one of the best movies of 2006 and is highly recommended to everyone."

Nonetheless, it really steams my dumplings when I exchange any of my hard-earned money in an effort to attain of a few brief moments of preferably mindless entertainment and I'm left feeling hoodwinked. That being said, The Wachowski's V For Vendetta SEEMED, based on its thrilling trailer, like the perfect vehicle for an action film fan to enjoy another edgy and fantastically rendered foray into the world of graphic novels. With (in the trailer) all those sexy shots of slashing silver blades, mingled with just the right amount of futuristic ambiance, gun play, pyrotechnics and mysteriously masked villainy, what action film enthusiast wouldn't run to his computer and buy his tickets in advance? You... you can be the one. <br/><br/>To all you other Joe Schmoes: THIS IS NOT AN ACTION FILM. Though the story was compelling enough, I would have rather they packaged it as drama so that I might be pleasantly surprised by the very few and very brief incidences of action-relief. Try this, hold up your hand with only your little finger extended, no wiggle it three times. You've just outdone V on the action scale. My advice: save your money, stay home and wiggle your pinky until the DVD comes out... you'll probably be more entertained and, if you're not, you can only blame your little finger instead of the big bad Hollywood marketing machine.<br/><br/>I'd also like to suggest that on the next go 'round the Brothers Wachowski either cast a lead sexier than Natalie Portman or add enough action to the film so that it doesn't matter."
"shadowcat2727","10","3","7","19 March 2006"," V For Vendetta: Not The Book, But Close Enough.
","Allow me to say first of all that as films go this movie is spectacular.<br/><br/>With that said however, it is just as apparent why the writer, Alan Moore, is unhappy with this interpretation of his graphic novel masterpiece. Though I personally feel that most of the same themes and messages from the book were conveyed in the film, the plot was dramatically different; almost definitely made so in the hopes of inciting controversy. The plot device of the British government using chemical warfare against its own people had nothing to do with the book and was to my thinking superfluous. But plot and ending aside, what bothered me most were the blatant mis-characterizations, the worst of which was V himself. The uncertainty and lack of planning exhibited by the movie version of V were far from the brilliance of the character from the novel. Indeed the scenario of Evey having to spend the year with V under the pretense of his 'not knowing what else to do' struck me as horrifyingly like a reality television show. And then there was Evey herself, roughly ten years older than she should have been and in possession of a wholly different background and set of personality traits.<br/><br/>It is my recommendation that you, if at all possible, read the book prior to seeing the film... not only for the thrill of the several scenes in which lines were word for word from the book, but also because I believe it lends a better understanding to the world that is V for Vendetta than any film ever could. And yet specifics and disloyalty to the graphic novel aside, this is not a movie to miss."
"dgeer80","5","3","7","19 March 2006"," Meh, it's decent.
","V For Vendetta is a peculiar movie. Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore (who, for some reason disowned the project) it has been adapted to contain a rousing beginning and ending, but gets too talky in the middle. This comes as no surprise, however, as the screenplay was written by the Wachowski Brothers - the same guys who directed The Matrix Reloaded, which suffered from similarly flawed storytelling. It seems that handing the directing job over to James McTeigue was not enough.<br/><br/>But this is not to say that the film is a total dud. It is not. It contains an interesting tale of a man who calls himself ""V,"" (played by Hugo Weaving from The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings films) who stands against a totalitarian Great Britain of the not so distant future. He wears a mask reminiscent of Guy Fawkes, who on November 5, 1605 attempted to blow up King James I and the Houses of Parliament. Therefore, V means to blow up similar landmarks of Great Britain on November 5th in order to get his point across - that totalitarianism sucks, and freedom should reign supreme. In the meantime, he seeks out his revenge on his enemies who have wronged him in the past.<br/><br/>Crossing paths with V is Evey (Natalie Portman), a woman whose family was persecuted because of this new regime, but for some reason stills lives an ordinary life - up until she meets V, that is. From that point on, V helps her cope with her past and ultimately side with his ideals. Unfortunately, her character does not offer more than that. Good thing Natalie is a good actress (aside from her poor attempt at a British accent), or there would be nothing going for this character at all. It seems that her character just gets us from A to B, with nothing really all that exhilarating in between.<br/><br/>Much has been said about this movie being anti-George W. Bush or anti-conservative. This can be looked at in two ways. On the one hand, it appears to be nothing more than just be a reflection of Adolf Hitler or Saddam Hussein and their ideals, since the leader of this future Great Britain, Adam Sutler (John Hurt), is labeled as a conservative (in the same sense Hitler was and Saddam is, which is more extreme), and this totalitarian state he governs seems to reflect similar ideals - especially with a scene or two in the film where people are killed, stripped naked and piled into a ditch like the holocaust.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the people who he persecutes and/or censors are not Jews or Kurds. They are Muslims and homosexuals. Even though James McTeigue claims this film is ""an allegory of all governments,"" it does come off as more of an allegory of the United States and its conservative leaders, because our current conservative leaders are mostly Christian, and the Christian faith teaches that other faiths and homosexuality are wrong. This is not to say that Christians commonly persecute Muslims or gays. This film simply presents a vision of what could happen if leaders in government became extreme in these ideals like Hitler and denied people the freedom to believe and live as they wish.<br/><br/>Whether this movie anti-Bush or anti-conservative is up to the individual viewing the film. But one thing is for certain: the whole idea of this film is to preach freedom. So while comparing conservative Christians to Hitler may seem extreme, our right to even say this in our country is a privilege to treasure.<br/><br/>Political differences aside, this film does get its point across and delivers some exciting moments. Hugo Weaving brings a delightful (and sometimes humorous) performance as V, and we're treated to some great visuals and action sequences when the film gets exciting.<br/><br/>But sadly, the film's exciting moments are few and far between, as uninteresting characters are given more screen time than the much more intriguing V character. And like what was said before, we are given too much dialogue and not enough show. The Wachowskis still have not found their way back to the proper balance between show and tell, and could take some lessons from the Wachowskis of 1999 who made the first Matrix film. Seeing this film was not a regrettable experience - just a forgettable one."
"Aretaku","9","3","7","19 March 2006"," An excellent film!
","I liked this film. Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman do a great job. Lot's of social commentary, even when you aren't looking for it, that straddles the political divide and makes you think. Some nifty plot twists and a lot of well done imagery. <br/><br/>I think this film will alienate some people, as there is (at least in my opinion), a definite liberal leaning to a lot of the film. However, the film presents these views well, and does not rub in it's ideas, but instead offers them up for both praise and criticism.<br/><br/>There's still other performances to see this year, but I think both Weaving and Portman should get nominations for best actor and actress. This film could have just as easily been a clunker had the performances been poor.<br/><br/>Overall, a great film, definitely worth a viewing...and remember, God is in the rain. :)"

","It would appear the Wachoski brothers are intent on warning of us our government. Following up the Matrix theme of a computer ran world, comes V for Vendetta. <br/><br/>With its none to subtle references to Nazis' Hitler,played deftly by Hurt, the movie leans a bit hard on the old adage to forget history is to repeat it. With veiled references to aids, government controlled actions, and the controlled use of the media, the movie makes great points and gives more than a few pointers to the would-be future terrorist of the world. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie, liked the imaginative use of the cross and the Nazi swastika, as well as the ending. If I must thank the brothers for one thing, its the refusal to turn a comic book into a movie with the same ho-hum endings that all others have had. Kudos for doing something original, and different. I will continue to watch your movies with enthusiasm."

","Rare is the film that can inspire one to act. This one can. Mirroring the current US (and others) political environment in many subtle and some very obvious ways, this film does call one to action. A wonderful facet of the movie is the dichotomy of the spread of fear on the national level while the personal battle with individual fear is occurring during Portman's butterfly act in the ""prison"" scenes.<br/><br/>I left the theater today and emerged from a quick cab ride, to find empty Illinois State Sheriff buses and hundreds of police standing around, sucking down donuts and waiting for the start of a protest against the war in Iraq. I laughed to myself... just after seeing this movie, a protest against a war started by spreading lies and fear... and the rhetoric has already begun against Iran.<br/><br/>Considering the sagging approval ratings of Mr. Bush, the xenophobia precluding the invasion of yet another ""Axis of Evil"" country is going to be a lot more obvious to the people than the prewar blah-blah against Iraq was.<br/><br/>The media is a powerful friend (or foe) and the government does a great job of managing it to their ends in real life and in this movie.

"Aomalle27","5","3","7","18 March 2006"," Visually stunning....but plot-wise weak
","This movie was surprising a great film...visually. However; plot-wise the film generally lacked. Natalie Portman plays a young woman in post apocalyptic Great Britan, London to be more specific. Appartently America engaged in a war with Radical Muslims (sound familiar?) was struck with a terrible plague, and basically collapsed as a nation. There's even a mention of a civil war in the midwest. But alas, I digress. The Great Britain of P.A. days is one ruled ruthlessly, much like prewar Germany of the late 30's early 40's. They even have their own Nazi-like insignia, and a secret police called fingermen. They pretty much push people around, spy on people, and even do random kidnappings of citizens in the middle of the night. We open with Portman's Avey character sneaking out in the middle of the night; past a government induced curfew. She is confronted by some fingermen, who basically push her around and try to rape her. (Does this happen in every lady in distress situation? I mean don't thugs do other things?) Anyway; enter V. A vigilante out for vengeance. You might actually say he's on a Vendetta. Ha, Ha! Very clever of the Wachowski brothers, making their title slyly work like that. Well, Avey's taken in by V, and he reveals his plan. Cause a revolution by celebrating Guy Fawlkes day by accomplishing what G.F. failed at in the 1500's; blowing up Parliament. Too much of this movie seems like the same old propaganda railing against the current Presidential administration of the U.S. Innuendo that this president spies on his own fellow citizens, imprisons them, and even kills them. It comes across more as leftist propaganda than entertainment. Where ""Farenheit 911"" was entertaining and funny in sarcastic tone, this is just thinly veiled disgust for the Bush America. They also make reference to the Americas being responsible for global destruction and causing the plague (pre-film). A character goes so far as to call America God-less. That's a first for me? Aren't we supposed to be a nation of religious zealots. Well, the great Nazi...oops, I mean controlled society of Adam Sutler (John Hurt as an obvious Hitler ripoff right down to the Nazi salute), wants total control of their society. It is revealed that they actually caused a pandemic on their own people to wrest control of the British society, and the film follows a morality tale of not giving too much power to government. Not enough strength to the plot to make it a great film, visually stunning enough to make it a good film."

The acting was superb. Hugo Weaving is spot on as always. Given the fact that he can't show any facial expressions, he uses his voice to pull you in. Natalie Portman, after the craptastic Star Wars, has something to work with. And as I'm sure everyone has heard some comments about her accent, I actually saw no problem with it. At least not enough to detract from the movie.<br/><br/>This movie, being politically charged, will spark some debate; and that's good. A good movie gets you to think and actually has some relevance.

"thenametheyallfear","7","3","7","17 March 2006"," Hmmmmmmm.
","I just saw this film at the local cinema (was hoping to see it in IMAX, but for some reason the UK doesn't seem to be showing it in IMAX), and my final thoughts on the film are ""Hmmmmmmmmm."" With the Spider-Man films, I was a comic fan beforehand, and I loved the films all the same. I was quite familiar with X-Men, Hulk, so on, and I enjoyed those films too. The harder thing with V, which I finally read in October, is that it's a mini-series. One story. Thus, comic fans will notice the changes more. I've noticed the films been getting rave reviews in the States, and mixed ones in the UK. That's why I believe the film will perform better across the Atlantic. Profuro is a Hannity-alike, which will have American liberals jumping with glee, but will have most English people scratching their heads. It's just not quite what we're used to. The comments Alan Moore made here about ""eggy-in-a-basket"" still hold true, and I was tempted to walk out numerous times during the first half hour. There were some brilliant moments, even some surprisingly decent ones (the alliterative opening speech isn't that bad, thanks to Weaving's fine performance), but after the brilliant beginning explosion there's a great slump. Shouts of ""Bollocks!"" and numerous shots of people with bad teeth in pubs seem artificial and forced. Natalie Portman's accent does improve as the film goes on, and by the time we enter the Shadow Gallery (a beautiful set), things peak up again. The torture scene: brilliant. The flashbacks to Larkhill were haunting. Its just the odd flaws that stop this from being downright brilliant. To a US audience, these flaws will not be so apparent. I'm not US-bashing. I am Iranian, I've been brought up in England, and I love the States as well. I have family in Virginia, and when I come to visit I'm taken aback by people's kindness and generosity, as a lot of people here have a somewhat warped view. Tangent aside, it's just that these flaws may make the film hard-going for a British audience. I love Weaving's performance, but the early TV station speech was one too many, and too soon. V has won over the populace within the first 20 mins of the film. This leaves less of an arc for the rest, but still, the film prevails. The final explosion, even the infamous V army, is proof of what Hollywood does best. A Mesmerising Climax. If you're desperate for a star rating, I'd give it 4 out of 5. Star knocked off for the artificial Britishness. Two stars for the middle slump. But an extra star each for the wonderful domino montage, and the... I was going to say explosive, but... one extra star for the ending it is. A flawed film, but one worth seeing. I just fear that Saturday the 18th will be like any other day, and that copycat criminals will give the film, and V's cause, a bad name (the shoplifter in the film may be a sign of things to come). Partly I saw the film today for fear of a Clockwork-Orange style backlash in the UK. The hairs on the back of the necks of everyone in the cinema were on end when they saw that Tube train packed with explosives. Even I, who had already read the book and countless previews of the film, was taken aback. An Uncompromising, but flawed, Vision of the Future, indeed."

","This movie isn't just about Hitler or Bush. It wasn't made for the liberals, nor was it made to rile up the conservatives. It had a lot of familiar to us imagery, many questions that people raise even today, and many ideals that are still held today, but it wasn't made to conceal political propaganda! The main idea is not that the government is spreading the bird flu and testing on people, it's not that terrorists should use violence for their cause, it's not about the war in Iraq and the United States collapsing. Yes, I agree, anyone could point out the parallels, but getting THAT out of the movie is just SAD.<br/><br/>The entire message is that the government needs to represent its people, not the other way around. Good people shouldn't need to be afraid.<br/><br/>Anyway, I give it an 8 because the love story kind of annoyed me. It didn't seem real.

","It is funny that half the people who admire this film for its activist components claim it has nothing to do with the Bush-bashers, just oppression in general - yet the other half admire it for putting the Bush administration in its cross hairs very specifically. They love to find the many inside code words and concepts that do this, but then miss the main point... that this film does glorify terrorism as a legitimate tool of revolution. ""Blowing up buildings can change the world."" Those who agree with the admittedly anti-Bush filmmakers place themselves firmly behind the hijackers who flew planes into the WTC and the Pentagon.<br/><br/>Whether Bush lied about Saddam Hussein or WMD (pretty much disproved because of the recent Hussein tapes that ABC released) makes little difference. Terrorism is evil by definition - and two evils do not make it right."

What's most disturbing is that a film like this - with its validation of terrorism - would not only be acceptable to anyone, but would even receive high marks from IMDb reviewers in the post 9/11/2001 world.<br/><br/>All I can say is, when you have a film in which terrorists are being portrayed as saintly martyrs, you have provided real-life enemies with quite an inspiring bit of propaganda.<br/><br/>The only reason this film deserves a 1 as opposed to a zero (even though I realize that 0 is not even an option here) is that it does serve a useful purpose.

","When I first saw the preview, V for Vendetta looked like it was going to be great. 1984 is one of my favorite books and I loved The Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded. It appeared that all the elements of a truly great film were there, and the preview left me counting the days until this movie opened.<br/><br/>What a difference a viewing makes.<br/><br/>I left the theater angered; not only because the message of the film was simply appalling, but also because V could easily have been everything I had hoped for. Since seeing the movie last night, I've looked into the situation regarding Alan Moore and his reasons for dissociating himself with this interpretation of his work, and his opinions have only redoubled my initial feelings.<br/><br/>What Moore created in his graphic novels was paradoxical meeting of polar opposites  anarchy vs. fascism  leaving the audience to judge who was right and who was wrong. What the Wachowski's have done in their bastardized version is play fast and loose with details while trying to force the round peg of their liberal politics into the square hole of Moore's original work. The result, not surprisingly, doesn't fit.<br/><br/>Subtlety is thrown to the wind as the brothers make their point painfully obvious. From the ""Coalition of the Willing"" poster juxtaposed against a swastika, to the ""religious,"" ""conservative"" politician who rules the movie's landscape, to the superfluous subplot of a government vendetta (small ""v"") against homosexuals, the nuance and innuendo of movies like The Matrix are nowhere to be found. The makers of V are not nearly as concerned with a dystopian view of the future as they are with the petty politics of the here and now.<br/><br/>In the end, V for Vendetta comes off as a thinly veiled attack on the Bush Administration. Say what you will about Michael Moore, at least he respects his audience enough to say what he means. V pays no such respect, instead choosing to convey an anti-American, ""yeah for the suicide bombers"" message that's as insulting as it is disgusting.<br/><br/>Alan Moore's poetic vision of a hyperbolic clash between ultra-left and ultra-right is nowhere to be found in this disappointing film.

"mountaindweller","5","4","11","18 March 2006"," Let's have a revolution about something else.
","V for Vendetta.<br/><br/>The movie capitalized on a variety of current paranoias to sell it's message that the people are being suppressed, and so forth.<br/><br/>The setting is several decades or more in the future where things are much the same as they are today, technologically speaking. It's a world where the USA is in some kind of civil war and Britain is in a 1984-like condition of censorship and surveillance (oddly John Hurt plays the leader of the government, but also played the protagonist in the film version of 1984). This condition has sprung forth from some massive biological attack that occurred on the isles and inspired a very conservative turn of government to control the chaos.<br/><br/>The story about the plague is directly taken from the first Aeon Flux cartoon, was used in Ultraviolet, but weirdly was not used in the recent Aeon Flux movie. The Aeon Flux cartoon showed the story, without the use of words, of a scientist making a disease to become popular and assume control by then distributing the cure. Great idea! Again this idea was used in V, but has become tired.<br/><br/>Also, the movie suggested that every single bad thing of any import that happened in England, right down to bird flu, was the result of government manipulation. When the government isn't doing that they're rounding up homosexuals, banning art, and trying to eradicate ""the beautiful poetry of the koran"" from our minds. This appeals to what I consider to be massive cowardice on the part of some segment of our culture. If the government has manufactured everything, then it is controllable and understandable. It's like your nasty schoolmate pulling a prank on you. That helps to fight off the confusion and horror that a disease caught from a bird might kill everyone you know, or that a bunch of stinky foreigners want to blow you up and rape your girlfriend because god told them to.<br/><br/>Anyway, as a result of some very poorly described government experiment, a person that has been badly burned decides to take on the guise of Guy Fawkes (code name V) a man that tried to blow up parliament, due to reasons having little to do with the film, appears as the hero. He's played by Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith from the Matrix) and despite the fact that he wears a kind of theater mask throughout the whole film, does a great job. I attribute this to the perpetually pleasant voice that he maintains and his twisty and elegant dialogue. V has a kind of crazy smartness that you never see in American characters (yet another reason to move to England). He would have been a great character with had their been a different fight on his hands.<br/><br/>There was one character other than V that set the whole tone of why I didn't care for the movie too much. He's a closet good-guy (amongst other things) and a big time TV star. While helping Natalie Portman he relieves his secret room where he keeps all of his contraband. In this reality, contraband is mostly the art object , but in this man's chamber we find more. He's got a copy of the koran! As mentioned above, he remarks about it's beautiful poetry and I found it amusing that it was clearly written in Arabic, and that meant to me that like most people that praise the fascist work he had probably never read it. Then, the camera does a quick scan across some creepy gay sado-looking photos that the guy keeps on the wall. He then admits to Portman that he likes guys and that is the motivation for his revolutionary leanings. I guess that he forgot that the muslims would try to kill him if they were in charge too. Oh well, he's a man living in confusing times.<br/><br/>So, the whole movie is about having a revolution about government conspiracies, homosexuality, and the koran. There's an old song that states ""the revolution will not be televised"" and if the same goes for this one then I'm afraid I'll have to miss it.<br/><br/>Getting away from the movie for a minute, I would like to know why liberals seemed to have abandoned the idea of revolutions over economic conditions. The average American is going to rack up over 50,000 in debt that they will never pay off in their lifetime and that amounts to them being an owned slave. How does that as an issue compare to the defense of a bizarre foreign religion, blaming every miserable event on the government, and maintaining top priority for the sexually anomalous? Friends, I suggest to you that the very people that permit books to be published and have the money to make films are the same people that make you slaves by playing the debt game with you. They want you to stick up for the infantile exploration of genitalia related issues, while they overtly and covertly own you and your entire family from now until....when?

"kinross_19","3","4","11","18 March 2006"," Want to pay to see a political ad?
","I just paid $5.50 to do so.<br/><br/>The movie itself was actually pretty entertaining, and if the political message was not so thinly veiled it would have been a somewhat enjoyable move. Unfortunately the hatred of the political system is so great in this movie that at times it is almost unbearable. So here is the low-down, and there will be spoilers said, but unless you feel the need to pay to see a hateful political ad there is no need to see the movie in the first place.<br/><br/>The story goes that V was ""made"" during a concentration camp experiment that ""England"" conducted. (I say ""England"" because although the story is set in England using English history it is clearly meant to be about America.) Anyways, he was made so that a company could make a virus, release it to the public, and then sell the antidote for a great profit. When the virus was released to the public everyone was scared and the government quasi-reformed to appoint a high chancellor, who ruled with an iron fist (mainly through the ""Will of God"", which is not said in the movie but is clearly stated). Soon after the government is given more power the anti-virus is ""discovered"" and the company that ""found"" it makes a lot of money. This is all presented as if the attacks on September 11th were manufactured by the government (i.e. Bush) to gain more control over the government and so Cheney could make money (even the guy in the move had a name close to Cheney.)<br/><br/>So V decides that a revolution is needed. He goes about killing all that had been a part of the government conspiracy (and others) and plots the downfall of the government. He is labeled a ""terrorist"" by the government and is hunted down (rightfully so). We find out that the government is killing gays and anyone who practices any religion besides Christianity. In the end of the move V kills the president, and (symbolically) crashes a train into the parliament building, all in the name of government revolution. By now all the citizens who were before some sort of ""sheep"" are now marching on the city. The movie ends with them telling us that ""V is me and V is you"". (There are many more parts left out, but that is the core of the movie.)<br/><br/>Here is the problem: this movie claims that the government is controlling people's lives through fear, and that is wrong (which it is). So V plans a revolution where he blows up buildings and basically tries to change the government through... fear. Why we are to believe that his fear ruling is better than the current fear ruling is unsaid. Secondly if a government was to control their population through fear, and persecution (of gays or people who practices other religions or otherwise), then that government *should* be toppled. That is what we did with Iraq, they *did* do this to their own people, and we stopped them. But in the movie we are portrayed as the reason the world is the way it is. And as country we did what the movie said is the ""right thing"" and we are being ridiculed for it. So obviously their solution to the current (""future"") sate of affairs is not correct.<br/><br/>This movie basically says ""revenge is OK"", ""don't trust anyone who thinks differently than what you do"", and ""the end's justify the means"" (which actually in the movie they said it didn't, but it clearly is a theme in the movie). So we need to blow up the governments building and make a fair and loving government through ...? (Anarchy?)<br/><br/>Now, I am opposed to some of the things that they are getting at, most notably the Patriot Act, but blowing up the senate, and anarchy rule is not a solution! It may get your change, but from Anarchy comes dictators, not freedom loving rulers.<br/><br/>In short this movie is not worth going too, but if you do go, watch for the message, and laugh at it when it contradicts itself."
"plob218","4","4","11","18 March 2006"," Just another neo-fascist butt-kicking super hero in a grinning, rosy-cheeked Guy Fawkes mask. Yawn.
","The Wachowskis have proved once again that the first Matrix was a fluke. Not only is this movie more long-winded than the ""philosophy""-heavy Matrix sequels, but there is almost no action to wake us back up after being lulled into a coma by the neverending (not to mention predictable) backstory.<br/><br/>There is not a single second of originality in the entire film. This may be the original graphic novel's fault, but in that case they shouldn't have chosen to make a movie based on a dumbed-down comic book version of 1984. Note: I have not read the original graphic novel, so I don't know if this was just a bad adaptation or what. Thanks to this film I never will. But I have read 1984. Shadowy ""Big Brother"" figure? Check. Censorship of art as subversive material? Check. State-planted news stories? Check. It's all the same things Equillibrium ripped off a few years ago, except the people who made that dreck had the good sense to put in some decent mindless action scenes to complement the mindless political philosophy.<br/><br/>Speaking of political philosophizing, it does make up the serious bulk of V4V's story, and has generated the most publicity for the movie. Some of it is pseudo-related to today's world--I saw the words Avian Flu on a news broadcast in the background at one point, but it doesn't seem to have affect G.B--but never at any point is it interesting. Some critics see V as a terrorist, which would make the entire film a celebration of terrorism. Others call him a freedom fighter, doing battle against an evil totalitarian regime. However, the truth is that he's a little of both. While the film assures us that the dictator is evil (I mean, he looks like Hitler!), V certainly seems capable of influencing the people without resorting to the violent theatrics that make up the film's climax. For all their evil, these fascists are terrible at keeping control of their state. In the first hour V takes over the nation's central television station with no problem, and not only can the government not stop him, they cannot even manage to cut the transmission before V delivers his long, meandering message of liberation to the people. He is able to ship thousands of rosy-cheeked Guy Falkes masks just like his all over the country, despite the fact that X-raying packages is the norm. These evil masterminds don't even control the distribution of mail? In fact, V's sworn enemies are so inept that one almost feels sorry for them. But we can't because, remember, they look like Nazis.<br/><br/>And are we expected to believe that a dictatorship that comes to power in England will model itself so obviously after the fascist regimes of last century? How stupid do they think we (the audience as well as the British people) are? The dictatorship of the future will look just like a democracy, except the outcome of every election will be determined not by the number of votes, but by the interests of the wealthy elite. Art will not need to be banned, because people will stop paying attention to real art in favor of mindless entertainment. Like this movie.<br/><br/>As a last note, how are people not insulted by the condescending intellectualism of this script? Not only do the Wachowskis (through the character V) toss Shakespeare quotes at the audience every few minutes, but they go through the trouble of identifying the quotes as if to say ""Betcha didn't know that!"" Shakespeare is great, but speaking in Bard quotes is for snobs.<br/><br/>C-"

The film was not perfect, however. There were confusing scenes, some things that could not be physically possible etc etc. However, the story was dark and frightening on a person level, but had a twist of humor throughout the entire film.

"Screen_Blitz","8","2","4","6 August 2016"," Violent, complex, but fascinating adaption of Alan Moore's graphic novel
","Corruption, graphic violence, and complex political themes supplement together in this visually striking adaption of David Lloyd and Alan Moore's hit graphic novel. Driven by a visceral direction by director James McTeigue, this dystopian action thriller captures the powerful energy of both Alan Moore's brilliant source material and the captivating (but convoluted) screenplay by The Wachowksis, and makes up slick, cutthroat thrill ride; but not without a few occasional flaws in the mix. Though the story offers plenty of surprises, it tends to cram way more ideas than the average viewer can swallow, particularly when the political atmosphere plays a major role in the plot. On the bright side, it also makes for a captivating experience. The film is set in the not-so-distant future in Great Britain, a country dominated by a fascist government under the head of the Norsefire Party, following the destruction of the United States from a civil war and viral pandemic from a disease known as St. Mary. Sporting a wig and a mask resembling the notorious Guy Fawkes, anarchist freedom fighter under the name V (played by Hugo Weaving) chooses to rebel against the government by posing as a vigilante and fighting against the ones who support the fascist government. Accompanied by television network employee Avery Hammond (played by Natalie Portman), V forms launches a resistance to bring down the government while avoiding oppressors appointed by political inspector Finch (played by Stephen Rea) who wants him dead.<br/><br/>Unlike most comic-book translations, this film is no superhero flick, nor does it have the feel of one. Instead, it offers something new and almost entirely inspiring to the table. Director James McTeigue accomplishes this by taking it's comic-book style action and characters, and blending these with a wide plethora of political elements and satire. Placing ideas of fascism, anarchism, and libertarianism in the mix, the movie puts political corruption in the front lines of the plot. The city of London in which the story is set is ruled by a government who blame individuals political rebels, illegal immigrants, homosexuals, and Muslims for the tyranny that plagues their society, and deal with the dilemma by imprisoning these specific groups of individuals in concentration camps, thus ridding the society of their freedom. The titular character V responds to these practices by rebelling, and does so with violence as means of Justice. As a result, the character is portrayed not as a hero nor a villain but a figure who does what he believes is right -- basically an antihero in some degree. The plot makes great use of these political elements, but at times struggles to evenly balance the narrative and the political atmosphere. The movie more often than not tries to cram so many ideas into the story that it makes for a significantly complex journey. On the bridge side, director James McTeigue does a great job at not only keeping things moving but executing them in a way that is arresting rather than heavy-handed. By the end, there's never a moment that feels wasted.<br/><br/>In the midst of it's flaws, the V for Vendetta prevails at both a visual and acting department. Presenting a likable cast, the film provides audience with some of the most compelling performances ever put on screen in a comic-book flick. Hugo Weaving, veteran of 'The Matrix' franchise (written and directed by The Wachowskis) provides a charismatic vibe as V, the lead character who seeks justice against the totalitarian-like government. Natalie Portman, fresh out of the second 'Star Wars' trilogy', gives a blissful performance as V's accomplice and eventually love interest; easily one of the most memorable performances she's demonstrated in her career. Stephen Rea is also quite credible as the primary antagonist, a man who roots for tyrannical society through means of political corruption. His character is masterfully written with stunning complexity and fascination. These characters all function consistently well in a world embraced by engrossing visuals. The production design of futuristic London is beautiful to look at, and fits suitably for the story. The fighting sequences however, offer the best gem in the visual department, featuring bloody, stylized action with occasional bullet-time shots Matrix style. While the fighting remains mostly infrequent as the story dwells one plot development than action-set pieces, it's truly memorable ewhen it emerges on screen.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a complex, violent, but explosively entertaining adaption of David Lloyd and Alan Moore's graphic novel, an adaption served with spectacle and intelligence. This movie levels high on the ranks of comic-book action vehicles, and is strongly recommended of all fans of the novel as well as everyone else with a thirst of a compelling dystopian action spectacle."

I find his performance VERY powerful despite the fact you at no time see his face as it is continually behind a Guy Fawkes mask. I think he was able to bring some good depth to the character thanks to the various voice overs he has done.<br/><br/>I think the story could have been explained a bit more which is the main reason I only gave it a 8.

"julia_bensch","9","2","4","2 December 2015"," A brilliant movie
","I have given 9 stars to this film for different reasons. First I like story of the movie. One saves the world or better said, helps the people in it, because they have too much fear to resist the government. He becomes a symbol which is feared by the government, because they don't know who he is. Only Finch and his colleague of the police get onto him and in time you can see how Finchs attitude changes and he begins to think about the things that happen. Hugo Weaving plays the role of V brilliantly. The very intelligent and aggressive avenger with a lot of patience for the good thing. During the movie also appears his vulnerable side full of sentiment which makes him a very pleasant person. I like Natalie Portman as Evey . She develops herself just in a different way than V. She is the vulnerable rather weak person who becomes much stronger by V. While V becomes more vulnerable by the love to Evey, but he keeps sight of his aim.<br/><br/>As well John Hurt plays the role of Adam Sutler very well. He is a rather nervous person, therefore, tries to keep the people small and terrorize them. Just to understand the end you must pay attention to the movie. Especially on the persons who help in this film. Also the election of his mask has a certain background. I had never heard before of Guy Fawkes, but the film made me read a little bit more about it. The movie is thought-provoking .<br/><br/>You can already imagine the end of the film at the beginning, but the way the story is told, makes him something special for me. V is none of these superheroes who saves the world over and over again. In the principle he is a simple citizen who has done itself the task to save his city. And doing so he becomes a symbol for freedom."
"CinematicInceptions","10","2","4","14 November 2015"," Striking, inspiring, and lots of fun to watch.
","The main purpose of this movie is to give us a taste of what a world without fear might be like. Of course it does so by showing what a world controlled by fear can also be. This is made even more socially prevalent by the setting of 2020, only fifteen years after its release and only five years from now. Though we aren't given all the details of the transition from our current state of affairs into the Fascist society of tomorrow, it seems like the transition basically starts now (2015), implying how quickly things could go south. It's also interesting that they allude to the U.S. as if it is war-ravaged and essentially in chaos and that the current British government is partially run by the church, exemplified by the ""Strength through Unity, Unity through Faith"" motto. While V's main goal is to overthrow the government, he does so in part by giving the common people a sense of power and the idea that the government does not truly control them. This is furthered by the scene when Evey frees herself from all fear.<br/><br/>V is an intriguing character. You want to root for him because of his flamboyance, mysteriousness, radicalism, and seeming invincibility. But at the same time, his vengeful rampage seems so heartless that you kind of want to tell him to stop. I think the reason for this is that V believes that some crimes are unforgivable and that things can only be made better by the destruction of any person or institution that commits these crimes. He believes these things so strongly that he is willing to use any means to achieve his ends and has not one instant's hesitation between assessing the situation and acting on it. He seems to feel that his own conscience (along with the lives of others) is worth sacrificing for the good of the many. However, he also has a heart as seen in his progressive relationship with Evey and how he seeks to liberate the people. He even gives Delia Surridge a quick and painless death, solidifying his belief in the inexcusable and that being sorry for what you've done or being a good person at heart does not excuse your crimes. Whether his views are truly moral or not is certainly questionable, but you can't deny that he gets stuff done because of it. His target audience for these radical ideas, aside from the whole of England, is Evey Hammond. She is as appalled and awed by V as the audience is meant to be. She loves him for his ability to change her so drastically, but at the same time disagrees with his acts of terrorism. Evey works in the national television network (or what I think the graphic novel called the Mouth of the government), and so has a good sense of where much of the corruption that V seeks to end comes from. Stephen Fry's character Gordon sees this as well, and uses the people's ""reliance"" on television to stir things up a bit through his satirical propaganda. The final main character is Finch who is head of the detective force (or the Nose) and is therefore part of the government's innermost circle. Through his investigation and search for V and Evey, he discovers the dark secret of the current regime's rise to power. The notable minor characters are Adam Sutler the dictator, Creedy the head of the the police force (or the Hands), Valerie the lesbian woman who inspired V, and Dominic who works for Finch.<br/><br/>The main plot line aside from V trying to eradicate fear is Finch's investigation of the government conspiracy that V was a product of. I'll try not to spoil it, but I'll just say that it's quite intriguing and horrifying to watch the entire backstory unfold. I kind of expected the plot to be somewhat action driven, but there actually aren't that many action sequences. There are some exciting and intense scenes along with a few instances of combat, but there truly isn't that much action. What action there is has a very stylized feel to it, similar to that of the Matrix of course but with it's own distinct style. But V isn't really trying to wage war on the government himself. He wants to inspire the people to stop letting themselves be controlled by the government, so there is not really much need for V to pick random fights with the oppressors.<br/><br/>In terms of execution, it was beautiful. The colors were perhaps overly vibrant, but it looked nice. The script flowed well and the acting was great, though not with any outstanding performances. The directing and scene cuts and such capped it off to give us an experience that was not only thought provoking, but also entertaining. <br/><br/>If you're looking for something inspiring or exciting, this is an excellent pick. It feels like an action movie, but as stated before, it's not action driven. Pretty much everybody above the age of about 15 should see this at some point especially if you plan on being an active voter or involved in politics or government in any way. I would cation that there is potential for some to be politically offended by it since I've heard that the ideals in question align themselves with those of most liberals. I am politically unaffiliated, so I can give this last piece of advice without being biased: please have an open mind while watching this and take what you can from it even if it is not an enjoyable experience. Overall Rating: 8.8/10."
"pkneer","8","2","4","13 November 2015"," Pleasantly Surprised
","I went into watching this film with little expectations - I had seen commercials when it came out, but wasn't a big Natalie Portman fan. I was pleasantly surprised by her performance and energy she brought.<br/><br/>The main character, V, was the center of the film and his performance was top notch. His character and mannerisms were a joy to watch. He's a terrorist, a monster, and a gentleman - how is that possible? <br/><br/>This is an exciting, yet poignant film. It makes you think about big government and their ability to reign in its sheeple, so to speak, until the people just aren't going to accept it any longer. It is about revolt and loyalty to your country and each other. I wish that the film had gone into more detail about what exactly happened to V to make him the man he became, but it was mostly danced around. Very good script, excellent acting, and enjoyable action. Be warned, a bit bloody and violent, but most know that going in by now."

"aidanmurphy-98122","9","2","4","4 October 2015"," ""V for Vendetta"" is an artful display of a timeless theme
","""V for Vendetta"" entices audiences<br/><br/>For those who feel violence is no means to combat injustice, ""V for Vendetta"" may not be the best movie to attend. For those looking for an action movie that moves its audience, this may be the movie to own. As 2020 sees England slowly slip into chaos at the hands of a controlling dictatorship, a dark vigilante emerges to return freedom to London. Director James McTeigue and his cast of seasoned professionals deliver an unforgettable performance that is bound to convert anyone who believes one man cannot change the world. <br/><br/>When Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) is caught outside of her house after curfew, and three officers attempt to ""escort"" her home, she meets V (Hugo Weaving), who defends her from the violence that is consuming England. After rescuing Evey from the government's ""fingermen,"" he asks her to accompany him to a performance, which consists of V blowing up the Old Bailey to the classic tune of Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture."" In commemoration of Guy Fawkes' name day, the 5 of November, V calls those in England to band together and join him in a year to blow up the houses of parliament, as Fawkes had failed to do. What happens in this year changes England. As rebellion grows, the totalitarian shouts of, ""England prevails"" become muted, and the film presents the timeless ideal that people should not fear their governments, but governments should fear their people. <br/><br/>From writing to dialogue, ""V for Vendetta"" will leave audiences entranced. V, with his delivery of both soliloquies and allusions, causes audiences to fall in love with his vigilante personae, just as Evey does. Through his use of quotes from literary cornerstones such as Dr. Faustus, Richard III and the Bible, the audience learns that there is something deeper under that mask, something that makes him and his message real. However, something just as real is visible as well: the rage that confines V to a life of vengeance. This anger against his oppressors is perceived through his actions, as is seen when V quotes Shakespeare's Richard III and states, ""I seem a saint when most I play the devil"", as he stands over a corrupt official, ready to strike. ""V for Vendetta"" combines line delivery, writing and violence, to pull the audience deeper into V and his ideals. Along with V's visible ideals, ""V for Vendetta"" captivates audiences with subtle characterizations. V's sharp wit through classic quotes, as well as his quite statements of love for Evey, allow audiences to both revere and fear him as a man and vigilante. Beside V, of course, is Evey Hammond, who could be played by none better than Natalie Portman. Although some scenes make Evey look like a small child oblivious to how the world works, her ability to transfer her emotion and her ability to care for onto a man who only seeks revenge is impressive to say the least. This duo and their ability to have a relationship while little more than their names and recent histories, entrances audiences and questions what love truly needs. <br/><br/>The superior quality of filmography and special effects that allows the audience to receive and take in the emotion from Evey and V, is also worth mentioning. Most notable in the film are the scenes in which V comes to remove corruption from the government through the use of six deadly knives he carries strapped to his sides. As the knives begin to fly, the slow motion kicks in and the adrenaline begins to rise. Granted, some special effects may make the battles, explosions and bloodshed appear too real for most young moviegoers, but these action scenes separate ""V for Vendetta"" form the standard set of stale revolutionary films. In this way, a broader range of audiences receives the films revolutionary message.<br/><br/>This movie can easily stand on its quality alone, and the message it carries is an unexpected bonus. V's belief in just anarchy in the face of false justice creates a movie like none other, one that makes ""V for Vendetta"" a must see film."

","In the film ""V for Vendetta,"" a masked anarchist named V (voiced by Hugo Weaving) is bent on revenge on the Nazi-like government that has come in to power in Britain. V is fueled by revenge from experimentations on him that left him with no memory of who he was. He gets help from a young girl named Evey (Natalie Portman) and is able to cause the people of Britain to wake up and rebel against their dictator. The major theme throughout the film is fear and panic. The people of Britain seek comfort in the arms of a dictator after their water supply is poisoned and he promises to cure everyone. When he comes into power, he curiously is able to come out with a cure immediately and everyone begins to follow him almost blindly, ignoring the warning signs of what he may have done. Society seems to just accept the intrusive rule of the government, allowing them to constantly monitor their every movement and listen to their conversations at any time during the day. V's sole goal is to cause the people to wake up and truly recognize what's happening around them. The way that the dictator Adam Sutler is always shown on a massive screen looking down at his council resembles that of the ""Big Brother"" from ""1984."" There are more parallels in the way he monitors all of his citizen's actions constantly through intrusive surveillance. The dim lighting of nearly every scene helps to build the feeling that the society is in terrible state. Everything is dark and dingy and truly makes you able to feel like you are a part of the oppressed society. The angle of the camera work when Evey hides from Creedy's men also fuels to the emotional contact felt with her character. I believe that everyone should see this film, not only because it's a great film, but because it shows how people shouldn't blindly follow their government out of fear. It's understandable that the people of Britain wanted Sutler in charge so that he would cure their water sources and they would be safe again, but they gave up much more than they gained. V just wanted the people of Britain to wake up and come to grips with his idealism. He ended up having to pay the ultimate sacrifice, but as he told Mr. Creedy in one of his dying sentences, ""Behind this mask there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask is an idea, Mr. Creedy. And ideas are bulletproof."" This line sums of V's entire personality and his goals for his actions."
"filipemanuelneto","7","2","4","25 August 2015"," A good movie, but with dangerous ideas.
","This film focuses on the mysterious figure V, a masked without name or identity that stands against the English government. Everything takes place in a dystopian future, where parliamentary democracy gave way to a totalitarian one-party government, based on a strongly nationalist, repressive and ultra-conservative ideology. Inspired by a catholic conspiracy of the seventeenth century (the Gunpowder Plot), V declares himself a defender of democracy, starts a terror campaign against the government and incites the people to revolt against dictatorship. But, what no one knows is that V is driven by a desire of vengeance linked to his mysterious past. By his side is Evey Hammond, a young woman who is saved by V and eventually become close to him.<br/><br/>The film is an adaptation of a comic book written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd in the eighties. It was directed by James McTeigue, who also directed the ""Matrix"" trilogy and that seems to have a particular taste for Orwellian dystopias. The cast is headed by Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portmann in the roles of V and Evey, having been at a great level and toasted the audience with excellent performances. Very interesting are also some dialogs and talks, in particular the way that V introduces himself before Evey in the beginning of the film, where almost every word he says begin with the letter V. The character was able to transcend their individuality and become a symbol of struggle, with a gentle touch of anarchism. Such a strong symbol that, even today, we see masks similar to those used in this film in many protests around the world.<br/><br/>The only negative note: this film does, although perhaps without that intention, a ""defense"" that the ends justify the means, and no matter the destruction of public buildings, works of art and historical monuments when we are looking, through this gesture, to defend an idea or cause that we thought to be important. However, this is terrorism, and the people who does it are that fanatics that we used to condemn in other movies and in real life, which makes this idea too dangerous to be ""supported"" by films like this."

"congeekstador","10","2","4","20 September 2014"," The theme and acting is amazing for the story.
","Throughout V for Vendetta the main theme of the film is that in this world no matter who you are or where you're from you can have a great impact on the world and need to take what you want and do what you want in this life to live it the way you want to. Hugo Weaving plays V, an anarchist brutalized by the fascist group Norsefire that is controlling the United Kingdom. V wears a Guy Fawkes mask to not only conceal his true identity but also wears it as a metaphor for the aforementioned ""anyone can have a great impact"" theme. V repeatedly uses explosives, mustard gas, napalm and more to destroy government buildings in an attempt to destroy the dictatorship and bring freedom to the UK. At the beginning of the film, V rescues Evey (Natalie Portman) from several members of the Norsefire police form who were going to rape and kill her. She ends up telling him her entire story about how she lost her whole family to the Norsefire party and ends up becoming a confidant for V, and eventually his successor. Systematically, V hunts down and assassinates people of power that turned him into the person he is in this story and promoted the rise of the Norsefire organization in the UK. As he does he follows a similar plan to the one that Guy Fawkes set out to use in 1605 with the Gunpowder Plot. The plan involves creating a large explosion beneath the parliament building to destroy it as a symbol of power as well as all of the people inside it to ""start fresh"" with a new anarchist government running the show. Likely the most memorable quote from the film and books is the phrase ""Remember, remember, the Fifth of November: the gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot"". This rhyme is designed to highlight the fact that history will tend to repeat itself, and tyranny will always be met with resistance; V's delivery of the message makes it all the more epic feeling. The main purpose of V as a character is that he represents the feeling and the idea of a true free world, one that is powered by anarchy and the ""do what you want, take what you want"" mentality. He's a vehicle for change, which he was quite effective at when his message began to spread throughout the UK. Large groups of citizens end up wearing the Guy Fawkes mask and showing up in political demonstration proposing for the downfall of parliament and the dictatorship. As V moves throughout the list of people who brought the fascist regime into power and did him wrong personally, the lighting and angles on each assassination highlight two things: how sorry the people are, and how angry V is. The lighting around the victim in each death is softer than that around V and it really highlights how we're supposed to perceive each character so many years after their transgressions. In the assassinations, V is barely shown if at all and when he is, he is cloaked in shadow (on top of his already solid black outfit) and symbolically represents the angel of death and vengeance. In the end, V takes what he wants, does what he wants, and uses any means at his disposal to reach the ends he has in mind. He is going to make an impact, try to make a change for the better, and destroy the very thing that created him to do it. Anyone can be a hero (or anti-hero in this case), how you're remembered is the important part."
"braddugg","10","2","4","7 September 2014"," A thoroughly adventitious, thought provoking film.
","A thoroughly adventitious, thought provoking film. It glorifies anarchist and nihilistic feelings within.<br/><br/>The scene where V (Hugo Weaving) introduces himself to Evey (Natalie Portman) is in itself a masterpiece in dialog writing.<br/><br/>V: The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose, so let me simply add that it's my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V. Evey Hammond: Are you, like, a crazy person? V: I am quite sure they will say so. But to whom, might I ask, am I speaking with? Evey Hammond: I'm Evey.<br/><br/>After reading that absolutely mind blowing piece of writing, I really doubt if whatever I review here is read or even pertinent. But on a more personal note, It's important to me as a person to stand up to something, stand up to my conviction, my own beliefs and disbelief's, to stand up to my own self, that has made me. To stand in itself is a great thing but to stand up against everything, demands a character. A character that may be disliked, ostracized but shall nonetheless have one person who embraces it and who shall become the company of him or her for as long as he is alive. Now, the question that always bugs me how me do have character, how many question, how many seek the truth, how many seek reason.<br/><br/>The answer as it stood always is hardly any. The reason is most men and women are molded by beliefs that some others (be it parents, society, teachers) have embedded in them, but should they seek reason, they might have their own varied reasons and that would make him ""HIM"" or her ""HER"". I cannot put this succinctly but I hope you are getting what I am trying to convey. <br/><br/>I was told that 9 hours stay is a rule put in office, I asked for a reason, I was presented with one, I did not buy that reason, so I do not follow that rule. So am I an anarchist? Yes coz I do not follow rules that are not substantiated with reason. But still I have my own little discipline, my job pays me something, so I have to give back what I am expected to from my job. So that's the discipline I follow and the only thing indeed. OK, now let me sway back to movie, the purpose is to review it, but it triggered such nihilistic and anarchist thoughts that I was bound to put whatever I did above. <br/><br/>Hugo Weaving has a voice that is so haunting and manly that even though he wears a Guy Fawkes mask, we know that for sure behind that mask is a man who is strong enough to seek command just by his voice. Hugo Weaving plays V with a command. Natalie Portman as Evey plays her part sublimely well. The way she sleeps in Jail is enough for me to convince she is a good actress. All others, have done exceedingly well in there roles. But what made the movie so special is the environment, the dialog and the way characters are developed, you have a villain, a hero, a heroine and a setup, all are placed well and told us to supremely so that's what makes this a great film. For whoever worked on the fireworks in the film, a big thanks to them, coz they were so gorgeous.<br/><br/>I ca't say much but I loved it, I can relate to it coz I am a questioning person, an anarchist myself who has a discipline. You don't break rules that are formed with a reason that are made to make everyone happy and not just a group of people. Like driving on one side of road, not breaking signals etc. But rules formed without a proper reason, rather a reason your conviction does not buy then it need not be followed.<br/><br/>By rating this film, a 5/5 I am just completing a mere formality. But I warn each one of you (those reading this) to give this film some time coz this is not an instantaneously engrossing film, it grows with time. Inside most of us we sure have a V, but sadly we forget that there is one and succumb to the comforting herd called the world."

","Title: V for Vendetta <br/><br/>Condensed Storyline: A freedom fighter plans to overthrow the corrupt British government with the help of a girl. <br/><br/>Notable Acting: Hugo Weaving hits the ball out of the park with his performance as V. Similar to that of Natalie Portman who plays Evey, and what I like about Evey is the fact that she isn't just a ""sexy lamp"", she actually helps progress the story and grows into a good character through the story. Stephan Rea plays the detective Finch, who isn't a bad guy per-say. But he is a good character. The main antagonist is Mr Creedy played by Tim Pigott Smith, who is that good stereotypical evil guy. But not painfully stereotypical thankfully, because the last thing this movie would need is evil British stereotypes. <br/><br/>Costume: Accurate to how it is shown in the graphic novel <br/><br/>Incorrect History: The gunpowder plot was performed to created chaos by blowing up the house of lords, not a bid for freedom by blowing up the house of commons. <br/><br/>Overall Feel: This isn't what you'd expect from a superhero movie, acts of terrorism and psychological torture. That would be because V is an anti-hero and is form a graphic novel printed by DC comics. The movie itself is clever and well thought out, the cast are enjoyable to watch and the story and effects are well done. Classic action thriller movie, I would recommend it for lots of people. It also shows the line between ""freedom fighter"" and ""domestic terrorist"" are dependent on your side. This movie also likes to play with words beginning with ""V"""

","Freedom is a right of every person, yet it's a highly valuable commodity in scarcity today. Surveillance can be outright blatant (e.g. with strict curfews) but can also be secretive. The futility in all of this is that the public's expressions may be silenced, and freedom abolished. Not only does this decrease our quality of life, but it leads to the population living in fear.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta has a lot to offer. With subtle yet strong messages implicating past, current and future trends, this film reveals the truth surveillance states face. With great screenplay and plot development, this deep movie is exciting with both action and romance from start to finish. Despite its fantasy and surreal effects, there's a very strong sense of realism. The events in this film are not so different from modern day.<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed V for Vendetta. Although there are sequences full of unrealistic elements, the overall film is enthralling and stimulates the mind. It is one that reminds us of the duty each citizen holds. The power of an idea cannot be underestimated."

","Conjuring icons and tableaux from humanity's last four millennia (including Guy Fawkes, The Phantom of the Opera, Shakespeare, Huxley's Brave New World, Batman, Nazism, The Man With No Name, and a thousand other quasi-plagiarisms), V FOR VENDETTA is a confluence of electric ideas and wolfen imagery that will burn itself into the cortexes of this politically-tepid generation as Orwell's 1984 was burned into previous generations.<br/><br/>It may even make them do what today's society would rather they didn't: think.<br/><br/>Whereas 1984, published in 1949, heralded the pessimism of a far-flung future, where civil liberties were nonexistent, where government held tyrannical sway over citizens' very thoughts, manufacturing fear through canards and strong-arming via automaton Thought Police, the horror of VENDETTA's vision is that it reflects not a distant future, but the PRESENT.<br/><br/>Sure, it is clothed in a fiction; of a Britain gone Beyond Big Brother, where pseudo-police called Finger Men are given carte blanche to do with suspects as they please, including cold-blooded murder and rape; where the government can manufacture a virus, release it into the public, and then use the cure as election leverage, and where elected officials have stakes in the company that sells the cure - but how is this any different from a President and his cronies profiteering from a manufactured war that costs millions of lives, holding stakes in all the weapons and oil conglomerates involved? <br/><br/>Just as superheroes were originally created in reaction to their social climate (Zorro, to fight the tyranny of the Spanish Californian governor; Superman, as escapist vision after the Great Depression; Captain America, to give Hitler a good old American Right Hook every so often - all three of these icons also evoked by this film), VENDETTA's hero, simply known as ""V,"" is a superhero for OUR times, fighting for the same ideals as his predecessors, ramped up to 2000s ferocity.<br/><br/>Wearing a permanent Guy Fawkes facemask, V (Hugo Weaving) takes his cue from Fawkes' Gunpowder Plot of 1605 (to assassinate King James I by blowing up the Houses of Parliament), motivated by the same premise - to overthrow a corrupt government. Fawkes was foiled on November 5 (hence the rhyme, ""Remember, remember, the fifth of NovemberÂ…""). V is also the only surviving guinea pig from the manufacture of the lethal government virus, which necessitated his facemask and Bat-Zorro outfit. Hence his vendetta - against all his captors, now occupying political positions.<br/><br/>Departing from the storyline and ideologies of Alan Moore's and David Lloyd's graphic novel from which it was lifted, writers Andy and Larry Wachowski script VENDETTA in a society of 2020, but quite easily evoke a society likely in existence today: there is nary a doubt that this is George W. Bush's dystopian America. To take the edge off the scythe, the British government stands as allegory for the U.S. government, America having been nullified as a world power in a recent war.<br/><br/>On the November 5th night we meet V, he rescues Evey (Natalie Portman), just before he blows the Old Bailey courts, to the strains of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, promising in a pirated television broadcast to do the same to the Houses of Parliament next year.<br/><br/>Upon V's first appearance as the suavely lethal, black-caped vigilante, loquacious to a fault, my heart actually beat faster - at last!: a character intelligent, articulate and adept at weaponry - who is not the British Bad Guy. At long last, a truly knowledgeable and literate protagonist wins the day, not some disheveled cop or loudmouth devil-brat who teaches his parents how to love again. A Hero whose abode is piled high with books, where art and learning - not a big screen TV or sports memorabilia - are given pride of place; without the snide implication that knowledge equals nerd equals FRASIER.<br/><br/>WAR IS PEACE. FREEDOM IS SLAVERY. IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH - Orwell, 1984.<br/><br/>In the most ironic casting since Moses became the head of the NRA, John Hurt (who played the failed rebel Winston Smith, in the film version of 1984) overlords this totalitarian social order as Supreme Chancellor Sutler, whose every ranting breath from wall-sized TV monitors is channeled into policy through his armed regimes of thoughtless drogues. (How is this any different to a President who can sign a bill against torture and then use torture whenever he feels like it; who can progress a war effort without the legal approval of congress?) A small coterie of officials report to the Chancellor, for weekly doses of intimidation, among them, Finch (Stephen Rea), doing the ""disheveled cop who finds his conscience"" routine, and Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith) as the cop who doesn't have one.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman, who seems to have a proclivity for morally-ambiguous super killers - Leon, Darth Vader, and now V - effectively wipes away the stain of STAR WARS with this performance. I am in love again. Hugo Weaving, eternally hidden behind V's mask, lets his unseen elocution fly daggers, and is doubly commended for the fact that he is so clearly understood even without the benefit of seeing his moving lips.<br/><br/>""Behind this mask, there is an Idea. And Ideas are bulletproof."" <br/><br/>Watch any episode of REAL TIME WITH BILL MAHER and the occasional guest Republican will stand their ground like a braying ass, defending their pedestrian President against incompetence and duplicity against all evidence to the contrary. If there is one unquestioning drogue like that, there are thousands. An Idea being bulletproof unfortunately works both ways.<br/><br/>""The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta, held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous."" <br/><br/>This film is a cry out to the intelligentsia of the planet to hold fast - in one way or another, justice is coming in a long black cape..."

","'V for Vendetta' is set a near future London which, in appearance, is not so different from today - except this is a brutal totalitarian dictatorship where the secret police break down doors in the middle of the night, put black bags over their suspects' heads and then drag them off - never to be seen again.<br/><br/>This society is ruled over by the grim ageing face of High Chancellor Strutter (John Hurt), who is only ever seen on giant TV screens. The nemesis of this regime is an anonymous terrorist called V (Hugo Weaving), who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and begins the film by blowing up the Old Bailey, then declares he will do the same to Parliament on November 5th. Unwittingly involved with him are the TV PA Evy (Natalie Portman) - who V saves from being raped by two police thugs - and pursuing him is the downbeat but decent police inspector Finch (Stephen Rea).<br/><br/>The movie has its origins as an Alan Moore graphic novel, but it also recalls those other dystopian classics like 1984, BRAZIL and FATHERLAND, especially the latter with Finch uncovering a dark secret hidden by the state - the germ warfare attack which lead to Strutter's rise was engineered by Strutter's party and that V was the only survivor of the same biological experiments. <br/><br/>As well as being scary and creepy, satirical elements feature prominently. I like Roger Allam's manic right-wing TV pundit who ends his nightly rants with the blessing ""England prevails"". Also Stephen Fry as a gay chat show host who satirises Strutter in a Benny Hill-type sketch and subsequently disappears after a visit by the secret police.<br/><br/>Amidst the bleakness, there is hope. V turns Strutter's own Police Chief (a nasty Tim Piggot Smith) against the Chancellor, followed by a mass public uprising on November 5th with the citizens of London descending on Parliament wearing Guy Fawkes masks. V dies, but Evy places his body in a tube train loaded with explosives and sends it hurtling towards Parliament.<br/><br/>If 1984 was a projection of 1940s fears, then V FOR VENDETTA is a projection onto an imagined future of early 21st century fears about the erosion of civil liberties. Curiously - like CHILDREN OF MEN - in this future England has survived but the United States has ceased to exist (it's now the world's biggest leper colony)."
"hugomullaney","6","2","4","15 December 2008"," Read the Comic
","V is, in ma opinion, one of the most fascinating characters, not just in comics, but in all of literature. Why? Well as Alan Moore depicted him, V was enigmatic, ambiguous and at times quite chilling; the reader found it impossible to tell whether this was a passionate idealist or a cold-blooded psychopath. V talks (in both film and comic) about freedom and liberty; yet this is also a man who both physically and mentally tortures an innocent girl, murders a defenceless woman and manipulates all around him in order to bring about total social breakdown (admittedly in a fascist police state, though this does result in at least one child's death). Though I liked it, the problem the film has is that in trying to make V more human and sympathetic, it misses the point. V has more in common with the idea of a villain than a straight-forward hero. Scenes where he breaks down in tears when Evey leaves, when his hands are revealed to be burnt and scarred or when he cuts down a bunch of fingermen in slo-mo just don't work for me. And don't get me started on that bloody ""vis a vis' speech. Nice explosions though!"

","V for Vendetta is an enticing piece of work. It has inconspicuously clear parallels to Europe in the 1920s through 1940s, but also very interesting parallels to our own time. However, there is a major problem - and that is the falsification of historical realities - as is seen in the portrayal of Lewis Prothero, posing as a conservative Christian - while being somewhat of a Nazi stooge, in reality. The ideology of naziism having anything to do with the Christian Right is a gross distortion of historical realities, as naziism/fascism actually worshiped the ancient Germanic deity Odin - and praised the ancient Roman system as perfect. The Greek pantheon also had a central part of the role within the system. Furthermore, naziism as such was a leftist-center movement, not a rightist movement. As such V for Vendetta falls short of being anything more than simple propaganda."

","Since I've heard a lot of people raving about this movie and I missed it, I decided to rent it in the local videostore. I did not like it as much as I expected, and I guess it's for the very same reason why I liked the first part of the Matrix, but got disenchanted with it from part two on.<br/><br/>It's not easy to explain why. Certainly, it's hardly the stunning visuals or the rather interesting and politically relevant plot I have a problem with. I think it's rather the over-the-top moralizing and the sometimes rather unrealistic story.<br/><br/>About the realism: of course I know that fiction is all about ""the suspension of disbelief"", but that's exactly what I mean. Since the story is so relevant to our present global political climate, the lack of realism of V, the main protagonist, hurts the movie more than it does any good. Also, we hardly see him in the preparations of all his spectacular attacks and stunts. Take for example the delivery of all those thousands of Guy Fawkes-suits around the country at the end of the movie: if we are really to believe that this is a Big Brother-like, Orwellian totalitarian state, how is he able to pull something like that off? The makers of the movie wisely leave that question unanswered, and it's easy to see why.<br/><br/>About the moralizing: this is something that disturbed me as well. Especially the scene at the end, where thousands of people take off their masks at the same time, accompanied by Natalie Portman's explanation about how ""V"" is actually ""everybody"" (or was it ""all of us""? I don't remember it literally). It reminded me of the second Matrix movie, where I got turned off because of the long philosophical ""explanation"" at a certain moment. I don't like to be told by the makers of a movie how I should interpret a movie philosophically. I like to interpret it myself. This seems to be a typical trait of the Wachowski brothers: they want to convey a clear philosophical or political message. Alright with me, but I don't like it when it gets too explicit and nothing is left to my own imagination.<br/><br/>I decided that 6 would be a little too low perhaps, so I give the movie a 7. It's definitely not a movie you should steer away from. Technically speaking, it's perfect. It's just that I have some other problems with it. It may also be a matter of taste."

It's not just England as in the movie, but anywhere in the world where people allow evil to reign. There are a lot of dystopian movies that use the same theme in various ways, but in ""V for Vendetta"" it gives the ""hope"" that one voice can be heard. And if one person starts to walk, others will follow and they become the masses, and in mass, the people can rule. One should never forget, regardless of your position, be it political or religious, should you be heterosexual or homosexual, despite your color or race, we should all strive for freedom, not only in our own lives, but in the lives of our fellow human beings.

Even though I hope there will be no sequel since V is dead, I enjoyed this movie and I know you will too. it has never failed to impress me, especially the domino scene and the the gathering of V's supporters on November the 5. This movie is a must see!"

","Viewed as a thriller, without reference to Moore's book, it's a fairly good film. An enjoyable way to while away 2 hours. All what you would expect excellent picture quality, even though it's a dialogue driven film the sound is clean and well defined and it moves along at a pretty brisk pace.<br/><br/>As an adaptation it is, in my view, awful. All the layers were stripped away, complex interactions reduced to a few lines. The film was almost a parody. <br/><br/>I think I can begin to understand why Moore had his name removed.

"ladymidath","9","2","4","12 August 2006"," V For Vendetta
","Having read the graphic novel by Alan Moore, I was really looking forward to seeing V For Vendetta on the big screen. Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman were both excellent in their roles as V and Evey. I was particularly impressed with Hugo Weaving's performance, despite the wig and the mask, he managed to portray the pain and rage that was deep inside the character. It was a pity that the movie could not show more of the injustices and oppression that the people were suffering. The graphic novel really showed how bad things were in this dystopian future of England, but the movie seemed to just skim over this. What thrilled me though, was the letter from Valerie, I was hoping that the movie would do this justice and not just skim over it as unimportant. The scenes where Evey is reading this letter, inter cut with scenes of her torture, and flashbacks of Valerie's life were beautiful. All up, as flawed as it was, V For Vendetta was perfect"
"spirit_nyss","10","2","4","9 August 2006"," Amazing! A must see for everyone!
","This movie is by far one of my new favorites of all time. I must have gone and seen it in the theaters half a dozen times. It is great on so many levels. To start, the pure political commentary is ingenious, and hits the point hard. In the footsteps of classics like 1984, this is sure to go down as one of the great historical commentaries.<br/><br/>The acting is also phenomenal. Hugo Weaving does a fantastic job as V, conveying the confident and sophisticated character he is meant to be. He really brings him to life, and you get so much character development from him, even though you never see his face. Natalie Portman is also fantastic. The connection between her and V through the movie is so well played out, you can really empathize with them. (I think that's a word...)<br/><br/>As far as plot goes, it's packed full of action, romance, deception and energy. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. There is something for everyone in V for Vendetta.<br/><br/>I really just can't say how much I truly enjoyed this film. It has so many great one-liners, great character development (which can be a hard thing to come by nowadays) and amazing cinematography. Definitely a must see!"
"fuzzysham13","9","2","4","6 August 2006"," Remember V
","This is the best movie of the year. It's great. I really like how this is so straight forward, no subtext or subplots. I also really like how it's not a movie with political overtones, but a political movie. Some people may take Supreme Chancelor Adam Suttler as President George W. but I don't really think it's him. Suttler has an agenda, and that is to be all powerful and control everyone and everything. Bush, as much as I like him, doesn't have the intelligence to manipulate people like Suttler does. I think it's just a movie showing an extreme and how if people want change they have to fight for it.<br/><br/>I really like Natalie Portman's performance in this movie. Her accent fades in a couple of places but that's forgivable. I think the part that sold me on her as that role was when she was in the cell. The emotion she shows, and then the lack of emotion she shows at the end of that. She was just like ""shoot me, I don't fear you any more."" I also liked Hugo Weaving's performance. Even though you never see his face, it's almost as though you can see his face. He just puts so much emotion into his performance. I also like the guy they choose for Suttler. He played it very well being the villain and being so callous.<br/><br/>I think we all need to be like V a little bit. We all need to fight for what is right."

","Natalie Portman stars (sans hair) in the Vertigo adaptation of the cult Alan Moore / David Lloyd comic. Set in the not-to-distant future, 'Vendetta' tells the tale of ]V] (Hugo Weaving) a man who channels the ghost of Guy Fawkes to continue the good fight against a English dictator trying to rule the populace '1984' style.<br/><br/>'V' is a wonderfully written and acted adaptation (which Moore once again blasts) with excellent low-light photography (by the late Adrian Biddle) and overall guidance by 'The Matrix' Trilogies' Wachowski Brothers. Weaving gives one heck of a verbose and over-the-top performance but it works smashingly and is a highlight of the film. Portman is remarkable as well and is starting to show a bit of range as time goes on as the Sinead O' Rebellion Evey, a young woman with more in common with the terrorist 'V' than she could possibly imagine.<br/><br/>Yeah it definitely has a political slant but that's what the story's about. 'V for Vendetta' is an excellent action / drama with solid acting and imagery that should appeal to comic fans. One of my favorites for the year."
"Beachbumdude18","10","2","4","4 August 2006"," As Moving and intelligent as action movies get.
","Coming into the movie I had quiet low expectations due to the fact that it is a Comic Book movie and these days studios will make a movie out of anything that has ever graced the pages of a Comic book. The Main character ""V"" is well acted and very deep which is another surprise as thee cheesy looking mask is a bit discouraging. Natalie Portman's performance is absolutely outstanding and has truly made her in my opinion one of the better actresses in Hollywood. Basically the movie is about thee extremely right wing government in Britain that has formed after a decade of sickness and War, the people live in constant fear, minorities are imprisoned for being different, religious freedom and the freedom of speech are long gone, but out of the oppression arises V who attempts to open the peoples eyes to thee oppression the government is causing. Natalie Portman (Evey) is caught up in it all and takes refuge with V. The movie has many twists and turns but leaves no unanswered questions by the end. Now not only is the movie extremely well written, well acted, and with great action sequences it has a strong message that we must not let fear run our lives and force us to give up our rights, it makes us realize we must stand up to oppression now so our government will not become thee police state that V for Vendetta's worlds has become."

","For fans of the original V For Vendetta graphic novel, I can't imagine this film failing to please. I loaned my copy of the book to a friend and haven't seen it for some time, but as I watched the movie I seem to remember the film remaining extremely faithful to the book, with minor additions/subtractions during the transition from four color media to DVD. Everything happened as I remembered it in the comic.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman, whom I usually cannot stand, was even acceptable in this film, her English accent not as horrible as I imagined it would be (though true Londoners may have something more to say on that aspect, either way, a simple bad accent would never ruin a film for me. I'm just not that picky.).<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving is, as always, fantastic, whether as the Elf Elrond, Agent Smith of The Matrix, or here as the masked freedom fighter/terrorist known only as code name ""V"".<br/><br/>Originally written as an indictment of London in the Thatcher era, the production team has successfully updated the theme to reflect today's ""If you're not with us, you're against us"" mentality reflected by so many western nations, and in a time where more and more fringe groups are singled out as the cause of society's continued unravelling while governments decrease personal freedoms in order to preserve freedom (though nowhere nearly as horribly as portrayed in this film) and even speaking out against a government leader's policies can get you the evil eye, this serves as a cautionary tale that is both enlightening and entertaining.<br/><br/>Personally, I loved it.<br/><br/>McQ"

"baloch","9","2","4","10 July 2006"," A rare pleasure amongst so many failures out there.
","My standards are perhaps unrealistic but I expect much from movies. I expect intelligent movies with superb plot lines, adequate pace, dramatics that are meant to do more than just run out the clock, and yes, above all to leave me thinking about them for days to follow. Alas, rarely have I taken pleasure in what I have watched for so long. This evening, while watching V for Vendetta, all my expectations were not only met but also exceeded beyond my standards. V for Vendetta left me reminiscing about classics such as 1984 and Brazil and belongs to a category of movies that deliver powerful images along with ideas that have resurfaced time and again in human history. I will watch this movie again, learn from it, analyze it, and enjoy it. This movie was a true viewing pleasure and I hope others will find it as satisfying and intriguing as I have.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a movie that one must allow him or herself to truly immerse in from beginning to the end. It is important to empathize with the characters and the settings to grasp the concepts, motivations of characters in the movie, and the subtle messages hidden behind the more obvious ones. This movie is not only about a concept, but also about a man, a woman, and a carefully developed supporting cast as they wind their way through the myriad of developmental cycles. My only complaint with the movie was the Matrix like special effects that were obviously placed to placate those expecting more action and CGI graphics than viewers satisfied with dialogue and story development. These special effects did not add to the movie but hampered it from identifying itself with other classics before it. Happy viewing."

Although I had never heard of the comic book before I heard of the movie, I had very high expectations for this from viewing the trailer. Well, my expectations were reached, and exceeded. Although you never see his face, Hugo Weaving's performance is nothing short of brilliant and Natalie Portman is pretty good as well. For such an amateur director, James McTeigue did a wonderful job. each scene is crafted perfectly and the movie flows. Also, there are some good performances from the supporting cast, especially Stephen Rea, who gives a dry but charismatic performance as the cop investigating V. There is also a great message to the film and although advertised as an action film, it is purely drama, and drama at it's best. With some comedy, action, drama, mystery, and even romance, This movie truly has it all and is a must see for all movie lovers alike.<br/><br/>I would also like to mention that the music in this film makes it even better than it already is, and it adds an atmosphere you rarely see in movies."

V for Vendetta, for me, was the consummate ""transport category"" movie of all time! I enjoyed every minute of this film, unlike any I'd seen in almost as long as I can remember. Its entertainment value is superlative and multifaceted; it's simultaneously dramatic, thrilling, humorous, suspenseful, futuristic, and revolutionary, but above all, it is an amazing cinematic accomplishment and wholly enjoyable! Among the innumerable, noteworthy qualities of this outstanding film, the strong emotional impact it had on me was impressive and exceedingly memorable. I was surprised and a bit taken aback at the range of deep emotions the movie evoked in me--like many folks, I shed the occasional tear or two at the appropriate, moving, or sad moments during a movie, but during one very poignant scene in V for Vendetta, I found myself struggling to control a literal sob from deep within my soul! This is a powerful, unique, wonderful gem of a movie: it is an escape like no other, it contains life lessons of great depth, and I guarantee lots of laughter as well: don't miss it!"

The script was literally flawless, special effects were used perfectly (and more importantly not over used) and the acting and directing couldn't of been better. Hugo Weaving's performance was impeccable, not one time during the movie did I ever doubt that his character was real (a credit to the movie and his acting). If he gets snubbed by the award shows this year I will lose all faith in the critics ability to recognize talent. Even with a mask on he delivered a truly Oscar winning performance. The overall film, script, director and special effects should at least be nominated as well.<br/><br/>Truly spectacular and I do not hesitate in saying it is one of the 5 best movies ever.

For being in a mask, his emotions were well conveyed. Spoiler>>>My favorite aspect of the movie is that you never find out who V really is. You never know his name, where he came from, why he was in Larkin Institution, or what he looks like. It really adds to the feel of the movie. He is part of everyone, and it would have ruined that if you found out all that information. I saw this movie twice in the theater and can't wait for it to come out on DVD. If you have any doubts about seeing the movie, don't. Buy it, watch it again and again. The movie is so detailed that watching it a second time will reveal hidden meanings behind things and open your eyes. Remember, Remember the 5th of November. Gun powder treason and plot.

","A film of pure genius. Disregarding the fact that it was americanised a bit compared to the comic book (which is so splendidly European), the movie is a must-see. The metaphores are great, so is the focus on Shakespeare and Goethe...the music is wonderful (from Beethoven to Tchaikovsky to Julie London) and just fits. Hugo Weaving is a god, and Portman is surprisingly good - better than I thought possible. If V wasn't played by Weaving, Evey would have stolen the show. I have only one problem with the film, and that is the following: why did the change the focus from anti-fascism to anti-conservativism. Because Moore and Loyd aimed it against Maggie Thatcher, you know? They had a very clear goal in mind when they set out to do what they did with ""V""."

"isabelle1955","Null","2","4","27 March 2006"," Interesting but not amazing
","V for Vendetta is not faultless by any means. I thought it got a little ""soggy"" in the middle during the prison interlude, a series of scenes which would have benefited from some livening up and editing, and the movie was both too wordy and too worthy in places, but overall, I thought it a good investment of two hours of my time and almost ten bucks of my money. Hugo Weaving's performance as V was astonishing, hidden as he was behind a mask the whole time, yet still able to covey pathos and purpose. While credit must be given to some intelligent writing, most of it was down to Weaving's sheer physical ability as an actor. His voice was both seductive and sinister and his presence never less than compelling. And Natalie Portman just gets better with everything I see her in. Stephen Fry also stood out as a gay TV host in a future Britain where homosexuality is once again a serious no-no.<br/><br/>I came to this film as a Brit who grew up celebrating Guy Fawkes Night (or Bonfire Night as it's more often called in colloquial English), and the playground rhyme Remember, Remember the Fifth of November is for me immediately evocative of chilly, foggy November nights from my childhood, shivering crowds gathered around a bonfire and letting off fireworks, hands clutching steaming mugs of hot chocolate to ward off the cold. Few of us gave any thought at all to the historical origins of this strange celebration; we simply seized the opportunity to indulge in public displays of pyromania, united in our rather subversive love of a good fire. Would Brits turn up in their thousands to watch the Houses of Parliament burn down? It's an interesting question. I rather think they might. (And I'm not going to get into the politics of 17th century Britain and the Protestant v Catholic debate or the recent appalling terrorist attacks.) The connection between Guy Fawkes and V in this movie, may be a little lost on other nations, but it makes the obvious point that terrorism has been around a very long time (with a variety of names), and that the old adage ""one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"" is as true now as it has ever been.<br/><br/>A future Britain has become a fascist state where information is tightly controlled and the population is kept in line by fear of the chaos and anarchy existing elsewhere. Or maybe chaos doesn't exist everywhere else? Who knows when a few people control the media and the populace prefer to spend their time watching brain-dead TV dross? Does this ring a bell? (Presumably the Internet and communication satellites have been closed down in V's Britain.) Undesirables of every type are rounded up and shipped off to secret facilities where they are the guinea pigs for various biological warfare experiments. A lone survivor of the worst of these facilities, a character known only as V, sets about single handedly bringing down the government and setting the population free by exposing them to the truth. And by blowing up a lot of London and killing not a few people.<br/><br/>The movie is interesting as a contrast to the Wachowski brothers previous Matrix trilogy. Fewer acrobatic displays, more old-fashioned explosions. And the plot is easier to follow but perhaps not as original. I have never seen the comic book from which it is derived, so I can't comment on the interpretation. But one thing I do like about the Wachowski's movies is that although they are full of stunning special effects, they are ultimately character driven, and we can get a sense of empathizing with the people at the centre of the plot. That's something too often missing from science fiction Â– or perhaps future fiction, as V for Vendetta might more correctly be called. I enjoyed it, and I think I could happily watch it again. My teenage son, perhaps closer to the target audience, thought it wonderful."
"barberoux","8","2","4","27 March 2006"," Natalie Portman makes the movie.
","""V for Vendetta"" was entertaining. I've read that the story is based on a graphic novel that I am not familiar with and so I probably missed many of the movie's references. The story concerned a revolutionary, V, in his battle with a future totalitarian English government. V enlists the help of young women, Evey, played by Natalie Portman, who he rescues from some predatory, corrupt police officials. Much of the story revolves around Evey and her relationship with the V character. Telling more would ruin the story. There's quite a bit of violence in the movie and towards the end there's a sequence of choreographed violence that I found to be too much though maybe those familiar with the graphic novel expected this kind of money shot. The movie featured many fine actors including John Hurt, Stephen Fry, Stephen Rea, Tim Pigott-Smith and others. Natalie Portman was very good, in fact she was a surprise delight of the movie. I thought she was better looking after being shorn. She's a babe. The cinematography was good and the story was complex enough to hold your interest. Some of the soliloquies were a bit idealistic but that is to be expected in this type of movie. Overall it is well worth a watch."
"nethlyn","9","2","4","27 March 2006"," Never read the graphic novels and loved this film
","I watched this after seeing The Hills Have Eyes Remake, but V delivered a very different type of blow to the brain! I have never read the original graphic novel so I was watching it purely to see how well the Wachowskis could move on after The Matrix. The answer? Considering the Matrix was seven years ago this was great. I don't know why fans of the graphic novel are so hacked off, if a lot more people like me will now go and buy the book. IF it's true that V takes off his mask in the comic, I'm glad they made that change in the film so that we never see him. It boosts Hugo Weaving's performance as does the lesser amount of action in this film vs The Matrix movies - then again this is set in a fictionalised version of a real place, where even in spite of the bombings and shooting of 2005, it would've been an unrealistic distraction to have as much action as an American-set film.<br/><br/>So good movie and a highly likely DVD Buy as well as the graphic novel itself. It's nice to know films designed to make you think don't stop getting released once the Oscars are finished. Predictably the messengers are getting shot in real life but who cares, the debate's not going to stop in modern times."

Following in the styles of The Matrix Trilogy and Bound, in terms of the look and issues, this film works on all levels. Especial kudos go to Hugo Weaving for his brilliant performance as V - only an actor of his caliber can take the Wachowski Brothers' intricate usage of dialogue and make it work. He keeps his mask on for the whole film and yet I felt the emotions he tried to convey WITHOUT facial usage - Mr. Weaving is indeed a great actor. Natalie Portman also does a stellar job as Evey, and the director James McTeigue successfully brings the Wachowski's script to life. Oh, and look out for the brilliant fight sequence finale - well done indeed - a V for Victory! This is no much a review as an endorsement for the film which I don't really want to give away the plot - suffice it to say, see the film, you won't regret it - 9 out of 10."

I went to the movie based on the IMDb rating and not only was I not disappointed - I was thrilled! This film has lots of action, but the characters are fully fleshed out. You find a great deal of empathy for both Evey and V. The social commentary was not overpowering, certainly less so than many other films I've seen. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it!"

","It may have been a great movie to those who haven't read the 'graphic novel' (or comic book), but I think it was a waste of time. The book is much more elaborate and detailed and never contained the love story sentiment like the movie does. I understand that most book-to-movies aren't nearly as good as the book itself but this movie has it all mixed up. There are many things wrong with the characters and is missing a lot of the story. I won't go into details, but I think it is right to add that if you choose to watch the movie before reading the comic -- I suggest you read the comic book with a completely open mind. The movie is very different."
"MichaelMargetis","8","2","4","26 March 2006"," ""Behind this mask is a man, and behind this man is an idea. And ideas are bulletproof."" - V
","So I expected 'V for Vendetta' to be a decent movie just from the talent that was in it, but I thought it would have a shaky storyline because the creators of the film, The Wachowski Brothers, were responsible for the Matrix sequels which crashed and burned faster than Vanilla Ice's music career (OOO! Diss!) However, I was quite surprised that 'V for Vendetta' turned into something more than a well-acted bam-bam shoot-em-up blow-em-up action picture. The film was not lacking on action, but it wasn't lacking on a great storyline either. The plot for 'V for Vendetta' is intriguing because it very well could be an accurate prediction of the future.<br/><br/>Imagine a society, a futuristic Britain society, where everyone is controlled by their government, and fear it. Imagine every second of every day being told what to think, do and eat. Imagine being the remains of a vicious holocaust led by a dictator as intolerant, determined and vicious as Adolf Hitler. That is pretty much the set up for 'V for Vendetta'. What would you do in this situation? Stand back and obey your orders, or fight? That's where terrorist codenamed 'V' comes in, a masked figure so fed-up with a fascist society he's willing to risk his life to restore the values and rights we once had. Along the way comes Natalie Portman's character who joins him in his revolution. The fight is on!<br/><br/>'V for Vendetta' is a very well made picture, surprisingly. Although it's pretty slow in the first half hour or so, it picks up tremendous pace and succeeds in enthralling it's viewer. The action sequences are breath-taking, and the acting is rock solid with spot-on performances from Natalie Portman, John Hurt, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry and Hugo Weaving who abandons his 'Agent Smith' like demeanor to play 'V for Vendetta's' protagonist. The aspect that's very admirable about the film is it's philosophy. The film is very poetic in the strangest of places, and that's exactly what separates it from most of noisome feces Hollywood produces on an all-too-regular basis.<br/><br/>'V for Vendetta' is not a masterpiece, and is not Oscar-calibre, however it's still a great film that almost anybody who isn't in awe of fascism and hate crimes can appreciate. I strongly recommend it. Grade: B+ (**** out of *****) (Screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 3/26/06)"

","Wow! I just got home after seeing this movie and was completely blown away. Everything about this film just seemed to work. The Wachowski brothers have perfected their style and it shows in this film. The blowing up Parliament scene at the end was a great touch. There were many political issues addressed in the film, such as homosexuality, but also it had some ties to the Hitler government. Natalie Portman is spectacular as the heroine Evey. She delivers her role with confidence and slight humor. She has a great scene with ""V"" (played wonderfully by Hugo Weaving) when she attempts to kiss him. Because it is so funny. John Hurt is equally as great (he and Portman are the best of the cast) as the High Chancellor in future England. A great film all around and I recommend it to anyone who loves drama-action flicks."

","This movie stands out as a true work of art in the pool of horrible movies in theaters today. I want to address the issue that has everyone the most worried: politics. Let me say that I am a Republican, living in Oklahoma, moderately conservative, and supportive of the Bush administration. That being said, I was not offended by this movie at all. I found its message to be very true but very broad to the point that it served as more of a warning to the people rather than a attack on any one specific faction.<br/><br/>That aside, the acting in this movie was superb, its dialogue intriguing, and its cinematography was amazing. This movie really makes you think about the role of government, and man's reaction to fear. And if you don't like all of this philosophy, the action sequences were really cool and the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat. I found nothing at all wrong with this movie, and I recommend it to all."

","Its been a really long time since I've seen a movie that actually moved me. A lot of the drama or action films that have come out in the past couple years, I have thought to be, somewhat predictable and boring. Going into this movie i really did not know what to expect. A guy in a mask? I was a little bit skeptical to say the least yet i kept an open mind. And was I ever wrong. This film absolutely captured me. I felt that the acting was superb, even though i have read reviews that said it was sub-par. Natalie Portman blew my mind and so did the rest of the cast. The totalitarian government is very believable and if you think about it, not that far fetched. I could see a government like that sometime in the future. And V, well his voice sucked me right in, they did an excellent job on it. And what I loved most about this movie, its not like spiderman or superman where hes a super human and can fly and shoot webs out of his wrists. He is a regular person who has been through disgusting governmental experiments. He just knows what is right and has the cojones to stand up for it. This movie moved me more than any other movie I have seen. Go and see for yourself."

","I absolutely loved the movie. It has some sort of appeal to every possible population out there, for example you have an action packed plot for the younger ones, and a deep philosophical question posed for the more mature fans. The director did a good job. Unlike many action films today, this movie seems to be cleanly cut, with no emphasis on useless action scenes. Every scene has a purpose. McTeigue cleverly intertwined the main story of Evey and V, Finch, and the various families to show how a ruthless government affected different people. I loved the ending. It was perfect. The fireworks, the removal of the masks. The people who died making a reappearance. Evey's final quote. It hit the philosophical point, what ever philosophical point you think that may be. The actors performed their characters well. I have to give mad props to Hugo Weaving for bringing emotion and class to V. His deep voice suited the complex role perfectly."

","First thing I will start off with is ""dont see this movie!""... IF you have read the graphic novel. It will totally ruin it for you and you will probably end up like one of these whiners on the boards arguing about which is better with the people who have not read them. My advise is to see the movie and THEN read the books. The movie is great on its own merits with very good acting, good cinematography, fantastic message, great story, and awesome characters. However, the movie is a terrible adaption of the books so there are things that are changed, rearranged, or all together left out. If you like thoughtful movies then you will most likely enjoy this one. Go out, see it, and have fun!"

","This movie definitely lived up to the hype. I was so impressed about how many allusions --and how many there were-- and how well they were built into the film. So much symbolism and thinking involved, but at the same time, some great action scenes. It made me think of quite a few different works...the most obvious being the Count of Monte Cristo, the theme of which they incorporated very well, but I also got vibes from Spartacus, Ghost in the Shell, and many different ideas. I was just blown away by how well the movie was made. And it never descends into sappiness, though at times, if i have one criticism, about how the romance was a little contrived, but it never really develops to the point of sappiness (again, Batou/Motoko vibes, lol...or Edmond and Haydee?) This movie is really worth the 8 dollars in the theaters."
"sullibrandon","9","2","4","24 March 2006"," Good Action Flick with a Well-Thought out Plot
","V for Vendetta is just the right kind of film you would expect to have come from the minds of the Wachowski brothers, creators of the Matrix trilogy. (They wrote the screenplay for V, based off of a graphic novel.) It hearkens back to the day when we were all wowed by their perfectly put together Matrix. The first one, not the sequels. V for Vendetta combines the perfect amount of thought-provoking dialogue and plot while spicing it up with enough a**-kicking to make it a worthy action movie. This is the kind of movie that shows how graphic novels are not to be dismissed as mere comic books, but are a juicy fare of their own. It reminds us of how good adaptations can be wonderful, such as the brilliant History of Violence or the wow-inducing Sin City.<br/><br/>It opens with a scene in the early 21st century, that cuts back and forth between Natalie Portman's character (Evey) and Hugo Weaving's (V). Within ten minutes we are treated to a blindingly fast razzle-dazzle bit of action, barely lasting a minute, in which V rescues Evey from a couple of corrupt officers of the law. At this point there is a delightfully brain-tickling bit of alliteration in which V, speaking for a minute or so straight, inserts a word that begins with V every two or three words in his sentence. Not an easy thing to do with the letter V, or to speak it without making it look rehearsed, but Hugo Weaving pulls it off with his silky mastery of language that made him famous as Agent Smith.<br/><br/>This brings me to how great Hugo Weaving is in the movie. He is behind a mask, the mask of Guy Fawkes, a freedom fighter/terrorist in England of many years ago. This mask is over his face the entire movie. Not once does he take it off. One would think that this would inhibit his acting skill, but it doesn't even come close. He brilliantly weaves his voice to excellently communicate his character's intent. He is undoubtedly the best thing about this movie.<br/><br/>The movie follows Evey's journey as V takes her under his wing in his terrorist plots against the overly-oppressive British government, along the way, of course, brilliantly giving the audience questions about the nature of government, the rights of citizens, and so on. This is another of the high points of the movie, the way it forces to the viewer to put into question basic precepts that might not otherwise be even thought of. V for Vendetta's basic idea can be summed up in one of V's phrases: ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."" From this springs the entire plot and idea of the movie.<br/><br/>As for special effects, the movie is no replete with action scenes. In fact, I got far less action than I was expecting. But as I left the movie theater, I found myself not really caring. The movie was a good movie, and I respected the filmmakers refusal to pander to trend in Hollywood today of filling up a movie with action so much that it overflows. V for Vendetta finds that delicate balance that a lot of movies do not: just enough action, and just enough dialogue. The action that you do see is quite breath-taking, bringing to the table highly stylized and cool innovations in special fx technology. The final fight scene is frenetic and flashy, and you'll probably find yourself saying, ""Wow."" To close, V for Vendetta is perfect for people who are looking for a solid action flick with a plot that can hold up under pressure. It has a heart and a mind behind all the effects, a heart and a mind that force the viewer out of the couch-potato mindset of watching a movie simply to see some gore fly. And it is well worth a ten dollar movie ticket."
"Lil_miss_tazzy","10","2","4","24 March 2006"," Amazing!!!
","This is such a powerful film! I didn't expect much out of this but went to see it because it had good reviews. The combo of Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving is very effective as they both have such strong personalities- delicate and coarse- they balance each other out. V's strategies are very well thought out but you can understand them without too much thought involved. <br/><br/>The futuristic setting is also very effective. The possibility of an American civil war is quite believable and who can question the fact that this could happen?(Not likely but you never know). <br/><br/>*SPOILER* Personally i thought that the death of V made the film even more poignant, and the decision of Evy to blow up the houses of parliament made it more powerful. However i did find that watching them blow up was quite depressing. Overall, this film had a massive effect on me and i hope it will on you too."

Furthermore, this movie also heralds fantastic acting from the tortured little kids to the secret lives of men and women.

With the situations in our present world today, this movie makes you very weary of certain liberties we are losing in our present day lives. Although, dealing with these type of issues can be rather overwhelming. This movie is able to portray real issues in an entertaining way. My teenage daughter also really enjoyed the film.

","This movie a perfect adaptation of Alan Moore's V For Vandetta. All the changes were necessary to update the film to reflect the present.

With reference to Iraq, Avian Flu, and Civil War in America this movie creates a future that is all to believable. This movie isn't just a call to arms for the people living in 2020 England but a call for all who watch it to change the world around them. The government should fear its people, if you stand against the government you aren't a terrorist but a revolutionary. V For Vandetta's depiction of media spin should open the eyes of those who find it almost too familiar. All in all this movie deserves a 10/10 for its meaning to the world today."
"theshadow908","8","2","4","23 March 2006"," A for Awesome
","V For Vendetta is an intelligent film with an interesting view into the future. It tells the story of a terrorist called V, who is attempting to overthrow the fascist British government in the year 2019. He is hunted by police, and joined by a young woman he believes is destined to be with him.<br/><br/>Like most comic book movies, V For Vendetta has a few big changes from the graphic novel, but unlike League of Extraordiary Gentlemen and Constantine, two other Alan Moore creations, the changes in this film make it somewhat more exciting.<br/><br/>In the film, V is such an engaging character that every moment he is off camera you find yourself wondering when he's going to come back. There is not much action in this film, so anybody going in expecting non-stop action like The Matrix will be sorely disappointed. Most of the film focuses on the rather unconventional relationship between V and Evey. I also liked how the movie is due attention to all aspects of the story. Romance, action, mystery, drama, even a little comedy thrown in. It's all present. One of my favourite aspects of the film is the realistic view of the future in the sense that it is only 13 years into the future, so don't expect anything too futuristic. No flying cars or laser guns here.<br/><br/>The performances in this film are really something else. I first saw Hugo Weaving in The Matrix, and I didn't think he was anything special. However, you have to have some amazing talent to be able to give a character dimension and charm, even though we never see his face. Natalie Portman wasn't always thrilling to me either, but she gives a great performance in this film. John Hurt...Well, John Hurt is always good no matter what role he plays.<br/><br/>V For Vendetta is a remarkable film that holds some truth in its message, and it is certainly better than most films that are set in the future. It's too bad that Alan Moore didn't want his name to be connected to this. He might have been proud, and he would've made huge money.<br/><br/>8/10"
"lovingthelie","9","2","4","23 March 2006"," The Break-through Tale of an Unorthodox Hero
","***This review won't spoil the plot**** So despite my usual concerns of seeing a movie on opening night (loud jerks, cell phones, and cramped theaters) I had to venture out to see ""V for Vendetta"" anyway. The trailer definitely captured my attention, and I went with high hopes. <br/><br/>What I found was quite a surprise. These days movies always portray ""super-heroes"" as ripped muscle men of few words who only utter slick catch phrases to give audiences their cheap chuckle amidst the story and action. ""V"" is a different story from the moment he graces the screen. Talkative in his British accent, and pretty much insane he breaks the mold of modern movie heroes. <br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong I LOVE action, but that's not what makes this a great movie. The story is great, with a lot going on, but not enough to send you out of the theater confused. The only reason I didn't give this movie a Ten out of Ten is because a little more action would have completed the experience. The sequences that do take place in the movie are awesome and wreak of style. I know I saw Joel Silver's name in the credits, and it definitely has his signature style stamped on the effects. The new, headache causing ""shaky camera"" IS NOT used much , if at all in this movie, so a lot of viewers will be excited to see that.<br/><br/>Props to the writers of the graphic novel, to the Wachowskis', Hugo Weaving (man you create all the cool characters), and Natalie Portman for solid jobs and for silencing a packed house on opening night. You sent this guy out of the theater a happy camper. I give ""V for Vendetta"" an ""A-"", and I seldom give out anything above a ""B"". Until next time silver screeners... this is Hock putting another ticket stub on the wall of fame."
"supertom-3","9","2","4","21 March 2006"," Brilliant movie, far better than the Matrix sequels!!
","The science fiction genre is very much a mixed bag. The success rate is minimal and generally the mega budgeted films fall flat and lifeless. V For Vendetta however falls under the mid budget range category and as such it's not a bloated attempt at marketable science fiction excess. This isn't like Bays shallow film The Island, or the disappointingly tame vision from Alex Proyas in I Robot, whose previous science fiction film was the moderately budgeted and superb Dark City. Essentially the producer pressure of these over-hyped and overpriced rip-offs don't have the love and attention given to films not green=lit with hundreds of millions. For example the first Matrix film, the most influential of it's genre since Terminator 2 (a rare hundred mill plus success!) was infinitely more engrossing than it's lifeless sequels. With endless resources at hand and the ability to go extreme, the Wachowski's two sequels attempted to cram our heads with philosophy and religious connotation that was more subtly fed to the audience in the original. The films survived only by the impressive effects and huge action scenes, and that goes for other similarly gigantic sci-fi epics. The films shot under that 100 mill bracket show more ingenuity and more heart, and mostly more originality. Even right down to ultra low budget there have been great films, like Cube, far more enjoyably thought provoking than the now boring Matrix sequels that completely lack the original films repeat value.<br/><br/>V For Vendetta is an immensely enjoyable experience. It is completely immersing and engrossing. The Orwellian plot, with the idea of a society led to be a utopia is as usual really a dystopian nightmare. In respect of the plot, influenced by the Guy Fawkes plot, we have seen this kind of story before, in movies and mostly in literature, and it's very similar to 1984. However this film feels so fresh, and as I watched it I felt I was watching something new, different, despite a recognised storyline. The film though, written by the Wachowski's has the depth instilled in their other films thus far. However this time V for Vendetta doesn't attempt to dully cram in existentialism into the gullets of its audience as in the Matrix sequels, rather it's depth is subtle and nicely delivered and will no doubt lead to great discussions on internet forums. This film will grow and grow and become a Sci-Fi classic like The Matrix.<br/><br/>The film is brilliantly directed by James McTeigue making his directorial debut, previously being an assistant to the Wachowski's and also George Lucas. Now there will no doubt be conspiracy theorists claiming Larry and Andy were in fact pulling the strings here, in their roles as producers and writers, but clearly, while showing some consistent style with the Matrix films, this is stylistically different enough to suggest Mcteigue is responsible for the most enjoyable Science Fiction film since Spielberg's Minority Report. He will be a name to watch no question. The film looks great that's for sure. The complementary relationship between visuals and script are first rate. Also while the trailers may have suggested this would be an effects heavy film worthy of the Wachowski's name, they were misleading. This is not a CG laden movie, there is comparatively little CGI to most modern flicks of the action/ sci-fi genre. Similarly the film has fight scenes but not the balletic martial arts of the Matrix films. There are marital arts but we get up close and personal, rough and ready. This is meant to look ugly not graceful. Also on another technical standpoint the production design is fantastic for this British and particularly, London set film. The musical score is also fresh and original sounding one of the most interesting scores I have heard for some time, from Dario Marianelli.<br/><br/>The cast are excellent, made up of a plethora of excellent British actors like the chilling John Hurt, and also good turns from Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry and Rupert Graves. The leads though are firstly Natalie Portman who is mesmerising as Evie. Not only due to her astounding beauty but a rich performance only marred by the odd slip on her near faultless London accent. She puts completely to dark her subdued turns in the Star Wars flicks and once again proves what an exceptional young actress she is (One Oscar nom already and will surely be adding more in the near future). Hugo Weaving stars too as the physical and vocal actor portraying V. In a role where he does not show his face at all, and wears a solid and inexpressive white mask, Weaving exudes gravitas, giving an impossibly rich and ambiguous performance for a rich and ambiguous character. V is at once a character to sympathise with and be unsympathetic to. He is at once a hero, a freedom fighter, a rebel, an anarchist and a terrorist. He's a walking contradiction but it makes his character incredibly intriguing. Indeed the fact we never really get close to his character or learn too much may annoy some people, but it added to the film for me and I feel will only create discussion, and theorising amongst buffs. The film indeed leaves questions left needing answers. It teases us and then holds back, and before you know it the credits are rolling. The sense of mystery will be discussed no doubt.<br/><br/>Overall this was a very enjoyable piece, bar for some pacing issues with some side plots, but still an engrossing film nonetheless. This will be a cult classic I'm sure and deservedly so. ****1/2"

","Believe me, V is the world's most elegant killer, geek, warrior and avenger.
He knew Shakespeare, he loved Tchaikovsky, he was moved by the revenge of monte cristo every time he saw it, he knew how to cook, he knew how to be nostalgic, he knew how to play old songs on the record player.
He did not belong to the world of his time, he was like an exiled aristocrat in the wrong time and space, enjoying himself but living alone.
He was romantic, and the explosives he used to destroy the Capitol building were even mixed with a lot of fireworks. The moment, the city shocked, people look up and see, the haze of the world has a fire tree honeysuckle. He turned revenge into a festival. He brings light.<br/><br/>For no reason, V always reminds me of the ivy-covered grey walls of old London, the rainy Thames, the Victorian street lamps in the fog, all the old, beautiful, and dim things.<br/><br/>The time of the story should be around 2040, in London.
It was the worst of times, when the whole of Britain was in the grip of a harsh power, like George Orwell's 1984, surrounded by sensors and surveillance systems, where people were silent and submissive.
V was the only survivor of the government's live experiment in viral bioweapons 20 years ago.
The object of his revenge was an era -- an orderly, gray, dead age in which gays, infidels, and political radicals would all be arrested and executed and somehow disappear as if they had never existed.
This world, stripped of all its heterogeneous elements, appears pure, calm, and without any edge, o Brave New World.
But the resentments of the masses have turned inward, into a kind of phantom utopia.<br/><br/>By accident, eve (Natalie berman) is caught up in V's revenge and brought back to his underground home.
The next day, she woke up, ignorant to hear swing to an old song, ""tears into a river."" Then there are the dark corridors filled with books, sculptures and paintings -- contraband from government warehouses.
Eve is a bit absentminded, whether go wrong time to come wrong age, she does not know today evening what evening.
Natalie portman, oh, I can't help but talk about her, the 12-year-old girl who has turned everything upside down. As an adult, she was becoming more and more normal, less and less evil, but still beautiful. And, this time, she meets the lonely killer again, fall in love with him again.<br/><br/>Love with forbearance and loneliness.
In the movie, she and V rarely have physical contact with each other. From beginning to end, they only share a dance, a kiss and a mask.
She didn't even know what he looked like.
Eve said to V
I don't understand why you have become the most important thing in my life when I know nothing about you.
Well, perhaps it is because there are so many people in this world who do not have a mask, but disguise themselves in other ways, that this man, wearing a mask, opens his soul. His beautiful dark old soul.<br/><br/>In the movie, there is a very touching letter hidden in a mouse hole in a cell.
""For you I don't know,"" it comes from a woman who was arrested for being gay and died in prison, vallari.
In the letter, she said, our dignity is so small, but that is all we have, that is the last inch of our territory, but within that inch, we are free.
Those who read the letter -- V, eve -- were deeply moved by it, and death is still holding its ground.
It was this letter that awakened the power that lay dormant within them, and enabled them to confront death and fear. They were free.<br/><br/>At the end of the story, V dies. He was lying in a train packed with explosives that ended at the Capitol.
He was surrounded by his red roses, the extinct scarlett Carson.
To his death he wore a mask, a smile of eternal contempt.<br/><br/>He went alone through the valley of the shadow of death to the chrysanthemum covenant, which he had made a year before.
He will twenty years of lonely planning, for a wild fireworks to see, to alarm, to cry, to joy.

"almalexian","7","0","0","28 April 2020"," Several good and even great elements, but fails to be a very good film overall
","You have to know two things about my review. The first is that I've never looked at the underlying comics before, or even knew about them, so everything in my review, which is based on the comics is an equal criticism about them. The second is that I first watched this film 15 years before it originally aired. This means that I've not only seen the wave of wannabe-Anons following the superficials of this movie, but also several of the elements on which the movie's dystopy is build on becoming true.<br/><br/>This is the first aspect I consider good about this film. If you have seen this film right at the start, you might consider the scenario built somewhat reasonable with 9/11 and gulf war in mind. If you watch it today and have seen several right-wing nationalists come to power these days you are ensured that this scenario is really believable. From several known dystopies I would consider this one of the more or even most realistic ones. However, why isn't this just good, not great? Because the details don't fit. The uprising of the chancellor's party is, although very shortly described, a smart approach to how the situation turned that bad. But it is also lacking of political deatils, a bit too easy-going to be believable and ultimately discredited by the somewhat silly looking Third Reich-references. This is somewhat explainable by the style the movie tries to create, but that is the next troublesome point.<br/><br/>Where is the movie headed? Does it try to create a visually impressive and stylish dystopy where weaker plot elements are overwhelmed by the artstyle? Could be, especially when you watch V directing a detonation at the very beginning. You have this mysterious masked man, the music underlying the explosion. Or when you look at the carefully built V-sign consisting of domino's, or the rather silly costume that Evy has to wear when she is approaching the bishop. The movie indeed shines in these moments, but it is not consistent. Because you have also the dramatic scenes. Men and women getting brutally hit, disappearing in the totalitarian system with a black sac over their heads. Shaved and naked bodies, dead and alive. You see real actor tears and even some reminiscence on better times, where you were not deported for loving someone of the same sex. These scenes are with no doubt well written and executed, and I actually felt something, which is usually good, but not so much for a film that presents a visually stunning hero who can murder a bunch of armed forces with some knives and a kevlar vest. The uneasy feel of the aforementioned scenes lets you question V's message and if you keep that in mind, an organized happening of silent Guy-Fawkes-masks-bearing protesters who wait for a firework in the form of the Buckingham Palace exploding leaves you ultimately confused whether this is a drama with comic elements, or a comic with dramatic elements. Not every movie has to restrict itself to one style, but especially a movie delivering such a strong message should better handle the balance of near-silly elements and its dramatic foundation.<br/><br/>When Evy gets captured and tormented by V, there is even some mindfuck in the movie. And there we have the weakest scene of the film. It was not untypical for V to do that, after all he is a weirdo suffering serious trauma and finding meaning in life when he surrounds himself with allegedly meaningful art and symbols. Taking a love interest on a joyride to make her feel his pain and hammer his thoughts and believings into her is something a narcissistic character like V would absolutely do and the character writing for V is consistent over the whole film, actually. On the other hand, Evy's well-written character gets shattered in this scene and she appears to be a blind follower of V's teachings after that. Let me explain this a bit. In the very first scene Evy if saved from some rapists by V. He is a scary and weird-talking man, so Evy has reasonable fears around him, but trusts him enough to follow him to his orchestra. In the scenes at the TV building Evy tries to stay under the radar, but when an ultimate decision has to be made, between returning the favor and keeping out of trouble, she decides to help him. Thoroughly reasonable. In his lair, she is considerably bothered about the fact that she can not leave, and when V kills the british Limbaugh, she takes the next opportunity to leave him for good. This is actually very realistic because even though she has some sympathies for his motifs, she rejects his methods and does not just stay with him for the sake of the movie.<br/><br/>However, if she gets caught, the reasonable and fearsome Evy changes, and not only at the very ending of it. She is shocked and scared right from the start, but from all we know before, she would immediately after that try to cooperate, help them in some way or at least try to convince them that she does not know a thing. Maybe the movie is just not showing these parts, but if she really would not talk out of fear it would be really unfitting for her previous characterisation. It even gets worse when V ultimately reveals that this has been just one big ruse to test her and make her feel the systems foot. She is again shocked, but after that she does not break out in anger, outrage or wild accusations. She does not try to flee, run away from both a system scaring her and a man actually torturing her, or try to hurt him in some way, show him a little bit of the pain she has endured or just lash out, break things and blow off some steam. She actually embraces him and his false sympathy for her and after a short visit in the rain, everything is fine and forgotten.<br/><br/>The last point of my criticism adresses the chancellor. Although not the antagonist alone, his ominpresent big head is clearly the symbol of the bad regime, the Hitler-cartoon to the otherwise abstract party Northfire. Similiar to the mediocre inspector, his positioning in the film is rather functional. His gargantuan face on the big telly in the bad guy's headquarter is a constant reminder that time is passing, party members get killed and no one has a clue how to deal with V. The fact that aside from his constant yelling nothing noticeable characterizes the head of this big, ruthless and smart party is really poor and he consequently gets shot in the head towards the end of the film without many more words, especially not about the details how his second in command get him captured in the first place. While the actions and the motifs of the party are interesting, sometimes even impressing, all possible antagonists fall flat at closer look."

","V is my favorite character of all time. I can quote almost all of his lines in the movie and have watched this movie a dozen times. The movie shows the strong message that if we leave government unchecked what can happen. I feel as though people see this as a slam towards only the right wing politics. However this couldn't be farther from the truth. The government in the movie may be fascist but V is a freedom fighter. He believes in the truest forms of freedom. Left unchecked on either side of the political isle you will get Stalin or you will get Hitler. V's message is that we the people should not cower before our government but that our governments should cower before us so that we ensure freedom prevails over tyranny"

","As the movie says, under the pressure of horror, horrible people will be cultivated. Terrorists are born with the mission of destroying the horrible world with their own horrific power.
""The artist uses lies to reveal the truth, but politicians use lies to conceal the truth.""
In the film, the government uses a mysterious institution as a glorious shell, and the interior is already dirty and horrible; they control the people through declarations and television media (the most important media in 2005). The emergence of V as a ""terrorist"" shattered this hypocritical shell, and the people did not fall into panic because the source of their real fear was suffocating government oppression.
Eve and the police officer accepted this idea and concept while slowly searching for facts. ""Three years later, thought can still change the world."" ""You can't kiss the thought, you can't touch it or hold it, thoughts don't bleed, they don't feel pain, they have no love."" Yes, thought can change the world, it can be inaccessible, but it has no love. However, people have love. During the time when V tested and polished Evey, V passed her a note; it was also the same as when V received the note. The contents of the note give V and Eve the ability to love.
""I'm in love with you. I never thought I could still love someone. This is the best gift you can give me."" This is what V said to Evey. I love you because you love me. This is the whole movie in a depressing gloomy atmosphere, but also gives a warm feeling to the heart.At the end of the movie, under the gorgeous fireworks, many deceased people appeared among the spectators. I understand it as the demise of the old world and the old regime. People who had been persecuted before were reborn as the new world arrived.

","""Ideas are bulletproof.""<br/><br/>With that one line, V for Vendetta solidified its place in movie history.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a beautiful masterpiece! Though there seem to be some plot holes, this movie presents its message well and is damn quotable.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta takes place in a near-future dystopian Great Britain. It's a world where an unjust totalitarian regime takes over the government. The movie makes us question what role we have when governments are no longer just.<br/><br/>The lineup and acting are superb. There couldn't have been a better cast to help deliver the message behind V for Vendetta. ""V"" delivers his lines with absolute charisma and charm. There are many, many quotable lines from this movie.<br/><br/>The plot leaves the audience sitting at the edge of their seat as they learn more and more about V's world. The action is bloody and satisfying. The film leaves enough action to keep the heart pumping but not so much that it distracts from the story.<br/><br/>Set design is well thought out. The use of color, darkness, and artwork adds another layer of subtlety that's beyond the initial viewing. The use of dark and dreary Great Britain with the well lit and beautiful past says a lot about the movie.<br/><br/>Yet, I will have to take off a half-star for some plotholes. EV's and V's relationship dynamic seemed forced in some areas. The matrix-style knife throwing did seem out of place and aged. And why did the comedian do what he did?

","Lackluster. Ho-hum aesthetics are uncalled for when you spend 50 million dollars on a movie that markets itself as a good-looking vision of the future.<br/><br/>The main lesson espoused in Vendetta is that Conservatives are evil, angry, totalitarian entities. In this portrayal, the makers managed to alienate half of their potential audience. Maybe that's why it only made 50 million in the US box office. Strangely enough, the intention of the makers was to create an Orwellien atmosphere, but somehow managed to fall far short. The thought-police could have been dramatically more frightening and dangerous then they were for one thing. The protagonists could have felt a heavier weight of oppression for another.<br/><br/>Vendetta's makers, the team behind The Matrix trilogy, want us to wholeheartedly agree with them that upholding a sense of morality at an authoritative level is a terrible thing. For one example, homosexuals are forced back into the closet for fear of execution. Don't worry Mr. (Mrs. ?) Wachowski, you can go on with your vile relationship without fear of execution. In another example of Pic's totalitarian world, there is a Koran being hidden from the government by one character. The makers missed the mark though. It should have been a Bible, not a Koran if they were really trying to represent the trajectory of today's ""progress"" in regards to what is tolerated and what is not. It was all I could do to stifle mild, disbelieving chuckles as the homosexual man with the Koran was fearing the evil, totalitarian, Christian, right-wing government.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most dangerous message that Vendetta represents is that terrorist actions and calculated, cold-blooded, vengeful murder are perfectly reasonable and expected actions when it means overthrowing an oppressive regime. Why the writers thought this was a good message to send in the wake of 9/11 is beyond me.<br/><br/>One other interesting tidbit: This terrorist activity and terrorist threats of our happy little protagonist take place in England against Parliment, which is supposed to represent the old world that must pass away if V's vision of freedom is to go forth. I'm quite sure that the Wachowski clan realized that if the setting was the US Congress, they would be in some serious trouble with our government for contemplating and advocating such activity.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, V for Vendetta ultimately fails, not because of the message, but because of the messengers. The makers show that they don't themselves believe in the values that their main character lives by (that being fearless against the ruling authority is essential), so why should we take what they say seriously? Their hypocrisy is all too evident by their choice to set their destructive agenda in someone else's country where they can't get in trouble for their near-treasonous message.<br/><br/>Shame on them. This is a poor movie with poor morals. V is for Vapid.<br/><br/>On a scale of -22 to 22, this rates a lowly -17."

","First of all I would like to say that I had read the comic first long time before the movie and I instantly loved it. The depth of the story and its characters is endless and the way Moore (writer) plays with the themes of anarchic philosophy is admirable.<br/><br/>The same cannot be said about the movie, which is a badly written draft of the comic. The Wachowski bros made a very simplified version of the comic by using a few of its key scenes and of course removing a lot of the supporting scenes which involve the change the characters went through by the influence of V in their lives (that is in the comic). In the comic ""the protagonists"" in the story is not V himself but Evey, Finch, Susan etc and V is more like the deus ex machina (an ideal) that changes their life for the better or worst.<br/><br/>WARNING: The following paragraph may contain SPOILERS, if you have not seen the movie please skip this paragraph and go to the end!!!!!!!!!! However in the film every character is given little screening time, insufficient to pass these serious changes, which when shown in a few short scenes seem forced and fake (Especially Evey's imprisonment and torture in the movie seemed so out of place and hard for no apparent reason - Evey in the comic is a more tragic figure always insecure, looking for a protector and in the end loosing it always). And the direct use of some phrases and dialogs from the comic, without the rest of the context, seem so pretentious and forced that you can't help feeling annoyed. An example of this is Valerie's letter; it is exactly copied from the comic (maybe one or two lines are out) but in the movie it feels completely out of place - it just sounds so cheesy!! In the comic I was completely thrilled reading it since there was so much more before it to give it the proper importance. Which leads me to another comment concerning the homosexual concentration camps: The idea of homosexual concentration camps seems completely out of place nowdays, while in the comic, which was written in the 80s (and homophobia was a bigger issue then) is presenting an alternate version of the past rather than the future, and it is much better presented. Oh, and don't tell me ""Natalie Portman acts amazing in this movie"", come on! just raising one eyebrow to look smarter and the shaved head do not make you a different person!!! gimme a break... I really DO think she is a really good actress and in other movies she has done some amazing work, but her character is already presented very bad from the film script and does not give her enough to work on....<br/><br/>END of SPOILERS.........................<br/><br/>Plus, in the movie script the people (the mass) of this society and how the government suppresses them is not so evident, (everything is about V, Evey and Finch trying to solve the mystery), and the ending seemed to me a complete show-off, typical Hollywood ending that need to be BIG and IMPRESSIVE... whatever...<br/><br/>In the end it is a caricature movie like batman or spider-man, which, directionally speaking they were far more superior than this. I do not understand why people give it so much praise for its direction since for me it was very stereotypical, falling in all the typical Hollywood clichés, scenes and shots completely uninspired, lighting conventional to the point of boring, and artistically speaking... well i am sorry but... The Victorian setting and dark mood of the comic seems more appropriate and creates a suspicious atmosphere, but this modern every day conventional world used in the movie does make V look a bit clowny and idiotic in his mask. Since you are dealing with symbols, ""an idea"", then make it look a bit more surrealistic. Anyway it's a fictional movie, is it not? Do not make another ""suffering hero in mask fights injustice in the world"" movie stereotype. V deserved much better than to be exploited in such a conventional way.<br/><br/>I am just sorry that this crazy boom of super-hero movies managed to drag along some amazing comic literature and degrade to the level of pulp. V for vendetta is more than a guy in the mask fighting oppression, like batman or spider-man. It is a story of the people, Evey, Finch, Susan etc caught in the middle of a fight between freedom (as represented by anarchist ideals) and oppression (as represented by totalitarian states). It is more than good fights the bad...<br/><br/>In the end to me, it is an exploitation by The Wachowski bros of other people's work, in order to make more money.... they even did the same thing with their own stuff... I mean look what they did to Matrix with the two awful sequels....<br/><br/>I cannot make you not to go see the movie, but give it the marking it deserves! and 8 is for sure not worth it! i gave it a 1(awful) in hope to affect the end result and because I was furious about how much it degrades the comic script. Having a few key scenes of the comic floating helplessly in air without the strings of the characters to support it make it look childish like spider-man.... it deserves a 5 for just another hero-fights-injustice movie with a spice of revolution....<br/><br/>Good luck and Good night ;-)"

Even though the producer Joel Silver tried very hard to convince the potential audience that the screenplay of the famous Wachowski brothers will blow us away in the last few month, the realization is uninspired. Self-evident a huge marketing campaign was started. Pages were filled with the news of the shocking new hair cut of starring starlet Nathalie Portman. She shaved her head, what a sacrifice. What an important movie must that be she is giving her hair for? Being bold didn't help Nathalie Portman at all to be any convincing in her role of a young working-class woman named Evey, who is rescued from a life-and-death situation by a masked man known only as V. Portman seems to have the ""Dakota Fanning Syndrome"" which implies to look with innocent wide open eyes always a bit desperately straight into the camera. That's it. Even after poor Evey got tortured by her master and should have gotten a glaring change of mind she doesn't adapt her play at all. The movie itself is just a big bang.

The dull leftist liberal American politics is just uninteresting..... We were promised a movie with the entertainment value of Gladiator, but instead it was just another movie in the line on Good Night and Good Luck, Brokeback Mountain, Syriana etc.. Why is it that after that fatty bastard goes political movie, Bowling for Columbine, that Hollywood has decided to become a worldwide forum for the American democratic party......I mean just take a look at the end of this work or neo-nonsensical movie......a bunch of empowered hippies walk through the soldiers? Now if this isn't a wet dream of those stupid anti-globalization children, I don't know what is.<br/><br/>I sure hope Hollywood gets off of this political train and starts making entertaining movie again.....because if I look at the movie theaters now on any given day about half are not from Hollywood.

Just to make sure, I read the multiple one-star reviews in the hated it section on this site. My impression was duly and doubly confirmed, hands down.<br/><br/>Poor Natalie, after Leon. Poor John Hurt, got up to look like a sort of raving Hitler, after the original Orwell film, and many other fine performances.

The reviews, the writing and the remaining actors all turned me permanently off.<br/><br/>The first Matrix film was definitely good. Since then, the Wachowski Brothers, Lilly and Lana, have plunged downhill with ever-increasing speed. The vote of 8.2 for this effort on IMDb is stupefying.

","Did I just watch what everyone else watched? This movie was not good. The fighting scenes were awesome and the main character ""V"" was very likable, but besides that, this movie just wasn't as good as people say, and trust me... that's a really weird thing for me to say because I am a die hard DC Comics fan. I don't want to make this too long so I will just say a few things I thought were dumb. 1. Natalie Portman's British accent was terrible.. Actually scratch that.... Natalie's entire performance in this movie was terrible. 2. The little girl with the big glasses??? What was that even? 3. Every (and I mean every) character besides ""V"" was so dull and disappointing. Do not see this movie, it is very overrated and boring."
"freemantle_uk","8","3","8","1 December 2009"," Best Alan Moore Adaption
","For me it's a toss up between Watchmen and V for Vendetta on which is Alan Moore's best work. Most people say Watchmen, but there is something special about V for Vendetta that marks it a remarkable graphic novel. Alan Moore's work has never been adapted well for the screen. There was the epic failure The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen which ruined Stephen Norrington and made Sean Connery retire from acting, and From Hell which butchered the graphic novel's material. V for Vendetta however has bucked that trend, but Alan Moore has completely distanced himself from Hollywood.<br/><br/>In the future Britain is being led by a totalitarian government, led by Adam Sutler (John Hurt). There is one freedom fighter, V (Hugo Weaving), a man who had suffered from experiments by the government and bases himself on Guy Fawkes. He has a two prong attack, one against all the people who tortured him, killing them for vengeance. The other is against the government, where he aims to gravitate support against the government, cause unrest, get people to question the government, and lead to an uprising against Adam Sutler on the 5th November. Early on in the film V saves Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a rebellious young woman who dislikes the government and works for the national television company. She falls for V's ideas, and sets out to help him in his quest. This despite her dislike for killing. The government as you can imagine doesn't like the idea of being overthrown. The special police are put on high alert and two officers are assigned to lead the cast, Eric Finch (Stephen Rea) and Peter Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith). Finch is simply a good cop who is just doing his duty, wanting to save people, and upset about the death of his friend, whilst Creedy is an ideologue who believes in the party and more importantly, his one self interest.<br/><br/>The graphic novel is of course always going to be better. It is so deep, full of ideas and numberous sub-plot. These can be covered in a comic format which when can handle them over a number of years, that a two-hour film can't. V for Vendetta is also a product of the Cold War and Thatcherism (the latter wouldn't have meant much to American audiences). In the graphic novel Britain had elected a left wing government which brought Britain out of NATO which is why Britain was never nuked during World War III. This had to be changed for modern audiences, and so it the idea of fascism vs. anarchism, to directorship and control vs. freedom of will. It was done well in the film though. For American audience V was turned from a anti-hero, anarchist who was willing to kill and betray anyone who stood in his way to more straight-forward hero who as well as uses action, uses more subtle methods to achieve his goals. The one major change I didn't like though was the change in Evey's character. In the graphic novel she starts as a scared 16-year-old orphan who lives in a labour camp and ends up trying prostitute herself. V saves her, introduces her to the world of rebellion and lets her grow as a character. She is a very conflicted, psychologically damaged girl, for example she has an with a man in his 50s. I thought that characterisation was more interesting.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta was the Wachowski brother's follow-up to the successful Matrix trilogy. They are big fans of the graphic novel, and wrote the script to be more then an action film or a simple comic adaption. It could easily have ended up being like Daredevil or Elektra where a not so well comic character ends up being in a weak film. They wanted to make a film with substances and places the film in a post 9/11, George W. Bush world. There are films about terrorism, how far someone should go, but I think the more important issue a government's use of fear to force through there policies (that's what George W. Bush and neo-cons did in America). Other ideas include freedom and what someone should do to ensure it, and the idea of liking in a surveillance society. The government in this film is basically a cross between the Nazis and Big Brother in George Orwell's brilliant 1984. I do however criticise the Wachowskis using some Americanisms in a film set in Britain. This is the first feature film by James McTeigue, an Australian who worked as the First Assistant Director on the Matrix trilogy. He shows he has a great eye of action, having some good, bloody fight scenes, as well as keeping the dramatic element, such as Evey's torture sequence and the flashback to the Larkhill Camp (they were also some of my favourite elements in the graphic novel). I'm sure the Wachowskis has some hand in directing the film, but hopefully McTeigue did most of the work. This make V for Vendetta a rare exception, were a first time director can make a good big budget film.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving was very good playing the distant V, a character where you don't know much about his past and you never get to see his face. John Hurt and Tim Pigott-Smith make good villains, especially Hurt as the leader of the government. I however criticise the casting of Natalie Portman. Her English accent was weak and an English actress would have been better for the role. I think Keira Knightley would have been a better choice for Evey.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta tries to keep to the spirit of the graphic novel, not to the letter."

"thebengalimafia-1","9","3","8","9 February 2008"," A wonderful movie, but you have to think.
","Watching V for Vendetta is like watching a horrifically frightening (potential) future of the United Kingdom. The Wachowski Brothers have written a screen play with countless allusions and nods to the happenings of the United States, the UK, and the world today. In the midst of pure tyranny, a man known only as V is hell bent on ending Britain's oppression. Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and wearing holstered knives around his waist as if they were guns, V sets out to give birth to a revolution. Some might say there's no way America or the UK could ever get ""like that."" Keep in mind, Jews living in Germany in the 1930s had no intention of immigrating to Palestine because they thought there was no way Germany could ever get ""that"" bad.<br/><br/>Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) is somewhat unwillingly thrown into V's (Hugo Weaving) plot to change the country through revolution. We constantly move back and forth from V and Evey to the council of Ministers. Adam Sutler (played by John Hurt, and I'm sure it's more than coincidence that his name sounds like Adolf Hitler), Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith), and a policeman, Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea) who is assigned the task of apprehending V. Finch pieces the puzzle together and finds out more about his country than he ever wanted to know. For Inspector Finch, the bell cannot be un-rung.<br/><br/>Some people didn't understand how all the politics of the movie work together and I don't want to get too deep into explaining how they do. This is one of those films that are better left to interpretation. One aspect that I think was very properly played up was the government's use of fear mongering. Make people scared and they're more than willing to give up civil liberties for a sense of security. What ends up happening is people become afraid to stand up and fight for their freedoms. In his time spent with Evey, V is able to thoroughly rid Evey of her fear. She would rather die than live in fear and that goes with the New Hampshire state motto; Live free or die.<br/><br/>There were a million and one references to politics, media manipulations, and media stereotypes. On the TV show Storm Saxon, the villain appears to be a black Arab Muslim. The very first scene makes a small reference to the war America started. There was a shot of a Nazi logo on the British flag, scenes of police hunting down Muslims and homosexuals; immigrants of any kind like during the Holocaust. One of the reoccurring themes in the film is the use of violence against innocent bystanders for the sake of the revolution; for the greater good. It's never made clear of V is a terrorist or a freedom fighter. He does kill security guards that were merely doing their jobs, minding their business. Like I said, it's left to interpretation. Probably the most ambiguous message to Vs cause came in the form of Guy Fawkes' Gunpowder Plot. Fawkes tried to blow up Parliament and V blows up the Old Bailey. Evey is confused as to what difference it makes to blow up a building. As V explains, ""A building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it. Symbols are given power by people. A symbol, in and of itself is powerless, but with enough people behind it, blowing up a building can change the world."" The thought made me scratch at first, but then I realized exactly what he was trying to say in all the wrong ways. Modern scholars on terrorism say terrorists don't always choose symbols; they just need something that provides them with an audience. With modern technology, they always have one. So in essence, the terrorists and freedom fighters utilize the same tools.<br/><br/>On a final note, something mentioned in the film is what people did versus what they had hoped to do. You may have the best of intentions, but shooting people and dropping bombs is unlikely to bring peace to a country."
"Nexus_VI","2","3","8","7 June 2007"," V is Preachy and Boring--Please Avoid
","I did not like V for Vendetta. Though I'm writing this review quickly, and not really crafting every sentence, I'll try to be comprehensive:<br/><br/>First off, let's declare a moratorium on genetically engineered super soldiers who get special abilities or powers as the result of sinister manipulation by a shadowy government. It's been done again and again and again: Captain America, Wolverine, Blade Runner, the Universal Soldier, the Hulk (by some tellings of his story)and scores of othersand now V. It's so hackneyed that it's grating to watch another movie that uses it as the basis for a character's development. Or, if you must do it, at least give the recipient interesting powers or abilities, not the usual ""enhanced reflexes and strength."" V, unfortunately, doesn't get anything interesting, just the ""genetically engineered starter package.""<br/><br/>V also steals the idea, and some of the visuals, of a dystopian England straight out of Orwell's 1984, but doesn't do it as well. Again, if you're going to copy another work, at least add something to the idea, or don't bother. Movin on, what does this dystopian society do to it's people? We're showed heavy handed second-hand tales of people being punished for being gay or even owning the Koran, told entirely without subtlety. We're practically bashed over the head with the fact that this is supposed to be the Bush Administration if it were ""turned up to 11."" And the maudlin scene at the end where the poor victims of the regime remove their V masks and watch Parliament burn was like a dopey Benneton ad. You feel like yelling ""Uncle! Uncle! I get it, just please stop sermonizing for the love of Neo!"" At least it's over by that point. <br/><br/>There are also points where the characters just do dumb things for the sake of the plot, which, in my opinion, undermines the credibility of the film. Some movies have a few small problems, but major points of the movie turn on these dumb oversights. Here are two major ones:  V faces down a cadre of soldiers at the climax, daring them to shoot him until they run out of ammunition. Of course, they shoot him in the body but the bullets have no effect, and none of them is smart enough, though presumably well-trained, to even try to shoot him in his flamboyant masked face, not one time. No, they think, let's just keep shooting him in his obviously armored body; Hey, maybe we'll get lucky! (they don't)  According to the film's contrived setup, the powers-that-be in the government had an entire year to prepare for V's bombing run at Parliament--But in their preparation they just happened to miss an entire railway station and a train tunnel that runs beneath the building!? This is completely idiotic! The inspector, always hot on V's heels, finds it within two minutes of looking for it at the movie's conclusion! But no one found it in the 12 months they had to fortify the area? Egregious writing, and the writers, obviously not thinking much of the viewing audience's intelligence, didn't bother to fix it. As I write this, I can't think of another movie that relies on such a stupid contrivance for its climax. <br/><br/>Finally, though the marketeers made every effort to connect this movie to the Matrix and the Wachowski brothers to make it seem like it would be exciting, it's anything but. It moves at a glacial pace and is actually boring--the cardinal sin for a movie that supposedly falls in the ""action/adventure"" genre (this according to Rotten Tomatoes categorization, at least). <br/><br/>For a more rewarding experience, just read, or re-read, Orwell's 1984, or re-watch A Clockwork Orange. These provide much more visceral, chilling looks at dark, totalitarian futures. V for Vendetta movie is not worth your valuable time or money."

When driving on a wet road you look out for pot holes. With this movie you can't avoid the plot holes.<br/><br/>I assume that if one accepts the movie's ending of the ending of the right-wing Christian dictatorship (what a crock that is...the last and only one was in Byzantium six centuries ago, and the thought of a ""Christian dictatorship coming to England, much less than to the United States, is silly)that those left on the ground, removing their masks (I guess to start picking the new anti-totalitarian atheist government)would somehow escape the anarchy that would ensue, assuming that the falling of Parliament would have a different effect from the toppling of the Twin Towers. What would happen would be the military stepping in to restore ""order.""

And, while wanting to put the government out of our misery, doesn't mind some collateral damage along the way.<br/><br/>The USA, is portrayed as a leper colony (why?) and later we see video of civil war in the Heartland. So why did the British need a Baptist dictator? The scene is one not at all removed from England today, people watching the telly, having drinks together..we even see families glued to their TV sets, and one scene that looks like a retirement home..but do these people give an indication of dissatisfaction with their lives? The movie doesn't indicate this. No, V is on his own here and can only resort to a string of assassinations and two glorious bombings. We never are taken into Parliament to see if that body is still deliberating; and if it was closed down by the dictator, why bomb it, other than the Guy Fawkes thing?<br/><br/>It is obvious reading the comments from people who have read the novel that this movie and the book are not, to use a phrase...on the same page.

I had never heard of the comic before hand, and leading up to the release had no prior knowledge of the plot, other than it had something to do with Guy Fawkes and Natalie Portman was in it. So I was very excited to see this movie, but was not expecting to be completely blown away. I went with two friends and after the movie was over we were so high on our own adrenaline, I felt as if I had just stepped off a roller coaster, and I didn't stop shaking for several hours after the movie was over. It was everything I could have hoped for and more, it pulled from Macbeth, The Count of Monte Cristo, the legend of Guy Fawkes, and so much more, with a little Phantom of the Opera thrown in to delight us romantics. Go see it you will fall in love with V and want to stand next to him as he saves the world."

They basically assume you're an idiot and can't recognize the political issues of our day on your own, then they slap you across the face with the most over the top fear mongering visions of the future that they could possibly think of.

"amberckerr","5","3","8","20 March 2006"," ""Beauty and the Beast"" meets ""Fahrenheit 911""
","I'm surprised to read so many comments saying that ""V for Vendetta"" was brilliant, complex, and thought-provoking. I would describe it as formulaic and heavy-handed, sometimes embarrassingly so. I enjoyed it nonetheless, but not as much as I hoped I would.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is excellent as Evey, and the movie is perhaps worth seeing for her alone. Her transformation from a scared young woman into a fearless freedom fighter is nothing short of inspiring. I had tears in my eyes as Evey, alone in her prison cell, found and read Valerie's final message.<br/><br/>That's where my praise stops. I suppose Weaving did the best possible job of portraying V, but his character seemed too much a Zorro-esquire clichÃ©, his dialogue too artificial, for me to really identify with him. And the romance between V and Evey left me unimpressed - the whole storyline is almost laughably similar to Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" (right down to the ballroom scene).<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" might still have succeeded as a fascinating and subtle political commentary. But the political events and their implications are laid out with a heavy hand; little or nothing is left to the viewer's imagination. The oppressive Sutler regime is a clear reference to both the current Bush regime and to the Nazi party (notice the red flags with black crosses on them). All the government figures (with the exception of Dr. Surridge) are exaggeratedly evil. And as if this wasn't enough, in the last third of the movie Detective Finch (I think) gives a lengthy narrative in which he tells the viewer *exactly* what is going on. No thinking required.<br/><br/>(The movie could yet have redeemed itself as eye candy. But alas, as my boyfriend pointed out, ""V for Vendetta"" is visually quite ordinary. Its imagery has none of the same flare as the Matrix trilogy. The several slow-mo fight scenes feel out of place.) In summary, I didn't feel challenged by this movie, intellectually, morally, or emotionally. Natalie Portman is great, everyone else is fine, the special effects are decent, the pace is relatively entertaining. But ""V for Vendetta"" certainly wasn't a life-changing or even a week-changing event for me."

","Whenever I read these user reviews on IMDb, I alway groan when the reviewer can't resist telling us the entire plot, so I won't similarly bore you. Instead, let's see if I can just convince you to see this film without giving away too much while still enticing you, eh? Well, just know the movie is expertly set, acted, and edited. I went to see this film mostly out of curiosity, and because initial reviews were so good and I love Natalie Portman. Here she leaves her lovely self behind to exercise her considerable actingskills, and succeeds. As good as she is, Hugo Weaving as 'V' is even better. He commands the screen while in a role hidden behind mask and cape. This, to me, is a true acting tour de force. Because Weaving cannot use facial gestures to convey meaning and nuance, he must do so with voice and simple head and hand gestures. I was absolutely stunned at how well he accomplished this, with the aid of some very good dialogue. In one of the cast interviews now circulating on the web, he was asked whether he still used facial expressions under his mask while delivering his lines. He replied that of course he did, that he had to, and to do otherwise would have caused him to fail at his part. Watch him closely as you listen closely, and you may be surprised at how expressive he is. The other actors all comport themselves quiet well (John Hurt is a bit over the top), and propel the plot along nicely. This film combines the best elements of action, intrigue, suspense and pathos. It does go off track a bit in the middle for the sake of filling us in on character background, but I found this tolerable, if not necessary. All in all, 'V for Vendetta' succeeds. See it on the big screen while you can."

","Not a bad movie except for its incessant prattling social commentary. The allusion to historical presidence is an illusion. And the worst part of all... Natalie Portman has her head shaved. There was ample time from when she left V to when she came back for her hair to have grown back some. This movie turns a beautiful woman into a strange looking boy.<br/><br/>V gets a 5 only because of the comical alliteration and the Benny Hill reference.<br/><br/>Once again The Wachowski Brothers have taken something that was good at the beginning, so horrid in the middle that you almost walk out, and recover with a decent ending. Does this sound like the Matrix Trilogy to anyone else. If you love the Whackoff Brothers, sorry Wachowski Brothers go see the movie. If you don't rent it at best."

","*Warning: there are a few minor spoilers, but nothing that should ruin the movie for you.* I am a huge Alan Moore fan. He is arguably the greatest comic book/graphic novel writer ever. (Neil Gaiman still has time to pull ahead). This is in my opinion, of course. Anyway, I have read most of his works, and 'V for Vendetta' is my second favorite...Just behind 'Watchmen.' After seeing the terrible adaptations of 'From Hell' and 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen', I did not want them to adapt anymore of his genius comics. I heard 'V for Vendetta' was being made and I shunned it. I ignored it. Even when the first trailer came out. I thought it looked bad...Because, well, the trailer was bad. But, I started seeing reviews all over the place saying it was spectacular and inspiring...It got me interested. I found out about the Wachowski Brothers love for the comic and Alan Moore...Gave me some hope. I was still extremely skeptical though. I kept reading good reviews over the next couple months, eventually gave in, and became really excited to see it. I got some passes to an advanced screening and attended on Monday night. I was nervous to say the least...I thought I had too high expectations.<br/><br/>I had a couple advanced screening passes. So, after waiting for an hour and half outside, we were let in. Then, we waited for about half an hour inside. The waiting was unbearable. Then, it finally started.<br/><br/>A little over 2 hours later, I was completely memorized. The movie was fantastic. I was so relieved. It's obviously the best Alan Moore adaptation. It may be the best comic book movie out yet...I have a really strong love for 'Hulk' and the 'X-Men' movies though. And it was a great transition from comic to the big screen...Probably the best they could have done. Even the changes were good. Not okay, they were good. There was only one thing they completely took out that kind of bummed me, but I know why they did it. The Wachowski's wrote an amazing screenplay. So good in fact, that I am able to forgive them for the third 'Matrix.' (I hated that movie). Everyone was spectacular. Hugo Weaving was DEAD ON...Especially when it came to the way he talked, and the fluent sentences he was able to pull off. Natalie Portman shines here...And it is probably her best role to date...If you have read Alan Moore's genius work, you will know what I saw when I tell you to wait until the ""imprisonment"" scene. She is amazing. Stephen Rea was perfect as Finch. And John Hurt pulled off a great pseudo-Hitler figure. I was also skeptical, seeing as they chose a new director to take charge....He only had experience working on the 'Matrix' movies. But, James McTeigue has proved himself worthy. The score/music was also terrific...The cinematography...Everything. The Wachoski brothers, who invented the ""bullet time"" craze used in a lot of films and video games now, decided to take it a step further...It's being called ""knife time""...And as stupid as it sounds, it really was not bad at all. Sure, it will get ragged on, and isn't nearly as cool as ""bullet time"" the first time you saw it in 'The Matrix', but it really was not a terrible addition.<br/><br/>So, all in all, 'V for Vendetta' was spectacular. Moore would be proud if he was to ever see it, but that is doubtful. I applaud all involved...They deserve a long standing ovation. Congrats.<br/><br/>Seeing this made me realize that even though most adaptations are terrible, every once in a while, one comes along and totally blows me away. Some adaptations are be very well done. It is rare, but when it happens, it's good. I wish all adaptations were as good as this one, but at the same time, I don't mind seeing a bunch of crappy adaptations as long as it means one this great will be done eventually. This brings hope to me for the 'Watchmen' film that cant decide if it wants to be made or not...I would love to hear that people involved in this film took over for that film...But alas, I doubt that will happen. I trust David Hayter...Especially since Alan Moore himself said it's the best screenplay possible. I just don't trust Paul Greengrass...I guess we'll see.<br/><br/>""Those who are responsible will be held accountable."" -V"

If you are close-minded and fear intellectual stimulation, don't see this movie. <br/><br/>Actually, see this movie anyway.

How can this be the first effort of a director (James McTeigue)? and has there ever been a more resonating and effective voice than Hugo Weaving, with apologies to Orson Welles. Really, he has, by his performance created a new category to acknowledge as great - the voice, the movement, but no face to see the expressions. Natalie believes in this amazing movie every frame, every second....and it shows, it glows. The theater was packed - we were asked by management do the old ""slide over and fill every seat because we're sold out"". and I have hope for a new generation....because people applauded (of course I was one of them) and stayed for the entire credits, always an excellent barometer of emotional involvement on a seismic scale.. and an unexpected reward - Americans will now know about Guy Fawkes.

","Well I just got out of the media screening to this movie in Sacramento, and all i can say is wow. Easily the second best, if not best comic book/movie adaptation ever made. The movie is laced with ideas and principle that rivals that of 1984 and many of the social impacting literature of the century. Though I cannot credit this movie with the origin of its thoughts considering the literature before this that spawned the comics ideas, I can say that the movie brings these ideas to life better than I could have ever expected. Imagine this not as the matrix, but as a more in-depth version of Equilibrium, with more pizazz and more commercial promise. In the end the best thing to say is, go see it. Go see it with an open mind, and you will leave with a new understanding; not of what movies should look like necessarily, but what they should feel like."

If you want a successful protagonist in real life or a movie against such a regime or power, look to people of the likes of Gandhi or Martin Luther King, not another Bin Laden-Batman wanna be. That any producer/director would attempt to play such a plot off to the public in the current state of the free world is beyond me. Give him high marks for bravery, no marks for intelligence. It also makes no sense from a political statement standpoint: Lowering yourself to the level of a terrorist is exactly what liberal media is crying out against the current government for!

","I saw it in the cinema years ago, I thought it was very bad and I wanted to see it again to do a review with fresh ideas. I have seen it again and it seems very bad. The reasons, some in zone spoiler and some not.<br/><br/>I do not understand how films that defend violence in such a radical way can be so successful.<br/><br/>All the actors are very well, well except one that we do not see anything clear.<br/><br/>The picture is fine. But the address leaves a little to be desired, it's too simple.

For example, to tell us the story creates an incredible situation as one of the freer, more cultured, better democracies has become a dictatorship, of course conservative. I could not take it to a country as there are still many with established dictatorships like Cuba, Korea, Venezuela, etc. Or maybe the reason is that I wanted to call the government of the moment, dictator, which is why I choose myself.<br/><br/>It creates a second story of the most typical. Since I am not an atheist, priests as always are pedophiles.<br/><br/>I am very grateful that the protagonist is watching ""The Count of Monte Cristo"". Do we want to compare a man who fights for his private property in a totally different moment of history with someone who in the 20th century is dedicated to killing people and destroying things that belong to everyone?<br/><br/>Then we have Natalie Portman that at first seems, as any person offended by violence, but then when anyone would have been very angry about what makes it happen V and yet he falls in love with him and it is she who bustles the congress .<br/><br/>The policeman, who defends the law and at the end let Natalie lower the lever."

","While I'm a pretty middle of the road conservative, but I can successfully bash this movie with out even discussing it's ideological content.<br/><br/>The movie it's self is boring as hell. The action scenes are few and far between which is what this movie sells it's self on in the previews. I think the V dude has a total of 3 fight scenes, one where he saves the girl at the beginning, the second where he breaks into a movie station and then one at the very end. The filler is so bad I literally started nodding off in the movie theater.<br/><br/>The concentration camp scenes were totally uninspired, when you are given the opportunity to do a concentration camp scene in a movie it should be an easy ticket to make your audience cringe. Instead the people in the concentration camp all looked like well fed pretty white people. The makeup they used to make the prisoners of the camps look ""abused"" resembled scattered cold sours made of wax liberally stamped on the actors.<br/><br/>The villains were poorly done. The main villain, the grand chancellor, or what ever his name was, is supposed to resemble a Hitler figure. The character really didn't come off as anything but old and cranky, there was nothing even slightly intimidating about him or any of his henchmen. It seems like it wouldn't be too hard to create a more in-human villain for the Hitler figure. There was no steely gaze, there was no heartlessness about him, no intimidation factor. On top of the fact the character did a bad job as a cookie cutter Hitler figure, he had no originality to boot.<br/><br/>The worst part was the flash backs, while I like most males enjoy seeing women kiss, the carpet muncher flash backs put me to sleep. The story it's self was kind of a smoozathon with no original twist or turns, just your straight forward generic crap you can see on Lifetime Network for free all day long.<br/><br/>There were a few plot holes, such as when one of the protagonists made the comment that he found the images in the Koran beautiful when it's a known fact that the Koran it's self forbids any pictures of any character in the Bible or Koran. While there were plenty more, I don't think I could go any further into the plot holes with out discussing the movies ideology which I am trying to avoid so a more liberal person will not read my review and think I didn't like the movie because of the pro-everything liberal stance. The movie it's self is poo and not worth seeing."

The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughout, a few slow moments, and an apocalyptic future setting that really heightens the tension with starkly dark set design and stunning cinematography. There is a reference or close resemblance to Guatanamo prison in the film. And it made the film even more direct.<br/><br/>Hidden behind the creepy mask, Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor. His character provokes thoughtful questions in a chaotic future, and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance. Portman on the other hand also excels, with a very convincing accent. She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well. The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled.<br/><br/>Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure.<br/><br/>Cracking movie with excellent acting, cool music, stylized visuals, great action scenes and a very nice story..

","THIS COMMENT IS COMPLETELY SPOILER-FREE, SO FEEL FREE TO READ IT IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THE MOVIE. THANK YOU.<br/><br/>I had never seen anything like this before, truly! The plot is so rich and filled with mystery and intrigue that not once during the story do you know what will happen next (as often happens with cheap Hollywood productions), making it completely unpredictable and breath-taking.The strongest element in creating this atmosphere is the historical background. Although this movie is set in the near-future England, the plot provides a rich ""history"" of what is going to happen in the years between 2010 and 2020 (all of them of course fiction). Some might argue that it is a little too extreme to be plausible but I don't think that this movie was ever meant to be plausible in the first place! It also has that political element that bugs a few people out but the well-developed characters make the movie very watchable to a willing audience. The story also uses the Guy Fawkes story to relate to its own plot.<br/><br/>The characters are also unique. From the mysterious and strong V (Weaving) to the megalomaniac politician Adam Sutler (Hurt); from the scared and fragile Evey (Portman) to the brilliant Inspector Finch (Rea), the plot is filled with memorable characters that give the story a believable cloak despite its rather implausible storyline.<br/><br/>The acting of this production is also memorable. The whole cast gave a wonderful performance, but I was completely astonished with the two main characters (i.e. Hugo Weaving as V and Natalie Portman as Evey). V was a very difficult character to portray, since his face was obstructed by a Fawkesian mask throughout the whole movie, but Weaving totally pulled it off using his mortifying voice and remarkable movements. On the other hand, Portman as Evey was also magnificent as is to be expected from such a stunning actress.<br/><br/>The screenplay was also awe-inspiring. Examples: both V fight scenes; the rain scene on the roof; the scenes with Sutler speaking to his minions on the big screen. All these are thanks to the Wachowski brothers as screenwriters and director James McTeigue for giving us these memorable scenes giving this movie a magical feeling. The soundtrack and sound effects are also very cool and go very well with the story.<br/><br/>While watching this movie, I couldn't help but feel that sort of epic feeling; it's like this movie is telling us a story that has already happened. There should be more movies like this one and i recommend it to everyone who enjoys movies that, like this one, have a lot of soul from its legendary beginning to its jaw-dropping ending."

I've read the graphic novel years ago and loved it, as I have most of Alan Moore's work. Hugo Weaving is fantastic and so is Natlie Portman. The only reason for not giving the movie a 10, is because the GAY and Anti-Christian messages are all fabricated by the Producers of the movie. Yes they also portray the Fascist leader as George W Bush and that if you read between the lines, he ultimately was responsible for 9/11.<br/><br/>It doesn't really matter that Bush was used, since this novel was written during the 80's. The story and message are so good that you could put ""ANY"" face on the leaders.<br/><br/>Memo to Hollywierd: NOT everyone is GAY and needs to have your agenda driven down our throat! I for one I'm going to choose to see very few movies in the theater any more, and watch as the movie sales continue to drop (As they have for the last 3 years and counting)."

","Whenever you hear a movie review by a good friend about a mainstream film, there will be the usual statements about its special effects, the performance of the actors, the consistency of the screenplay etc. etc. When asked about 'V for Vendetta', all these categories and considerations became irrelevant, with only one comment remaining: this movie is IMPORTANT. It is even that much important that it should be used at schools for political education and democratic awareness.<br/><br/>Why? Isn't the movie about terrorists who blow up buildings, kill police officers and government members? How could one condone such actions?<br/><br/>The main message lies elsewhere: YOU are the people, and YOU are responsible for democracy. If you accept the news in the mass media (which is not even half of the truth) without thinking over or further research, if you are easily infected by fear and paranoia induced by the ""authorities"", if you shut your mouth to all succeeding law changes, then YOU are responsible that the state becomes the biggest terrorist of all. Thus it's perfectly understandable (though, for me as an absolute pacifist, not justifiable) that a counter-terrorism emerges to fight the prime terrorist.<br/><br/>Democracy desperately needs people who ask, research, think, discuss, enlighten, and - if necessary - resist when things go awry. Like the Wachowski Brothers. Like Michael Moore. And - hopefully - like you."
"24540647","9","3","9","20 March 2006"," An astounding film.
","Having never read the graphic novel I went in to the theatre without to much idea of the film. All I can say is that it is a stunning piece of work, and certainly the best film I've seen in the past several months.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving plays the V character to perfection. Verbose upon first appearing, his quotes from Shakespeare always seem relevant. V is an unknown, we end up knowing barely more at the end of the film than we did at the beginning. He is a fighter for what he sees as justice, but understands that his actions are based on hate and revenge. It's what makes the ending so good (keep a good eye on the screen during the final shots!) Into his life comes Evey, a girl with a past who is just trying to make her way in the totalitarian state that is Britain in around 2040. She helps him see his feelings clearly for the first time through a series of meetings and actions that keep the film running smoothly.<br/><br/>This is not an ""action"" film but a curious type of love story that grows using the backdrop of overcoming a fascist government. Well acted and scripted, I was glued to the screen throughout.<br/><br/>Special mention must surely go to Stephen Fry, who's character, like the man himself, seems outwardly happy and sure but hides a soft and easily hurt interior. John Hurt as the megalomaniac bible bashing dictator also makes it one of his best parts for many years.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to kick back and enjoy."
"davekov","3","3","9","18 March 2006"," Zorro enters The Matrix
","In The Matrix, the Brothers Wachowski combined elements of the technological with elements of the antitechnological, with exciting and interesting results.<br/><br/>In V for Vendetta, the results are... less than interesting.<br/><br/>What we have here is a classic adaptation of /every/ Latin American hero-tale, placed into a sausage maker and focused into one single link. There is a government which is so repressive, so blindly tyrannical, and so often associated with True Evil that it may as well be ""The Machines"" from the Matrix trilogy, or Sauron's army of Mordor from The Lord of the Rings epic. Against this rises a masked man, once wronged by this government, now committed to its downfall. There is a pretty girl. There is cool swordplay. There is violently over-the-top acting which conjures to mind the campy excesses of Ian McKellan's Richard III.<br/><br/>And then there is a roll of credits.<br/><br/>It is not a difficult movie to understand. There is an Evil. There is a misunderstood Good. And in order to destroy that Evil, the force of Good must perform Evil acts (TERRORISM being the chief modus).<br/><br/>No doubt, this will send into paroxysms of argumentative delight the people who enjoyed Crash, Farenheit 9/11. and other such 'think pieces'. Like those films, I found V for Vendetta to be more of a didactic statement, a monologue, than a movie - and that monologue is about a hair from being a sermon. Many people will enjoy debating how the movie throws into question the 'ethics of terrorism' and the 'necessity of civil disobedience'.<br/><br/>These are all valid, interesting arguments. This movie adds nothing to those arguments; all it does is use them to drive a plot which is otherwise nothing more than THE TALE OF ZORRO. If it were set in Mexico City rather than London...<br/><br/>In The Matrix, there is a science-fiction scenario created where antitechnological actions (Kung Fu, and in later movies swordplay) can be used in tandem, or even in superiority, to more modern weapons (guns, explosives, &c). In V for Vendetta... there is a guy with a mask who throws around daggers and seems to be protected by the Angels of Righteousness and Justice. It is a story set in the future, and yet the hero makes more use of archaic weapons than did even Neo or Trinity.<br/><br/>Entertaining it was, and certainly well-polished and well put together. But it has to be said that The Matrix was a more Believable movie than this - and that, I am afraid, is a sad statement to make about any movie."

","Set in a post-mass-terrorist-attack Britain, this incredibly adapted screenplay ushers the viewer into a world of tyranny, oppression, and persecution. After a terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 80,000 Britons in response to a continued assistance with an American war, Britain is now a police state. At the head of this new government, is the High Chancellor, a fascist, symbol-oriented and power driven man bent on total control. Enter Evy, a young, but scared woman, whose parents and brother were arrested and killed as a result of the dictatorship. She is on the way to visit one of the TV show hosts of the network she works for. Unfortunately for her, she is out past mandatory curfew. She is attacked by two men with the intentions of either raping and/or killing her. She threatens to pepper spray them; their response of which was that they are officers in the secret police, and that her action was a capital offense. They then move to have their way with her, when a harlequin-masked figure steps in to stop them. After defeating the men in hand-to-hand combat, this figure turns to Evy. Still frightened by the attack on her by the police, and now just witnessing this new figure's power, she asks him for his name. After a continuing consonance with the letter V, he reveals his name...V. In one of the most awe-inspiring films, the viewer is taken into the background of a marauder, into the workings of a tyrannical government, and into their own beliefs and values. Basically beginning and ending with a powerful rendition of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, the story will grab a hold of you and not let go until long after the viewing. Considering that the work for the basis of the movie was written, not in the post 9/11 era, but in Thatcherian England, the movie resonates with today's society as much as it did then. We must all take their message to heart and understand what is best for our nation. And as always....Remember, Remember the Fifth of November. GO SEE THIS MOVIE"

","""Who was that masked man?""<br/><br/>From Zorro to Batman, and all other masked marvels in between, our fascination with disguised do-gooders doesn't die. Add a worthy entrant into that pantheon: comic book genius Alan Moore's futuristic avenger, V, who roams London purging it of criminals common and famous, all of whom suffer his rage at having been abused in a government experiment years ago.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a superior adaptation, whose major virtue for me is the lack of quick cuts and computer graphics, the exception to the latter being the spectacular destruction of a few London institutions. V's mask has a smile that sears with irony and humanity, plain and simple, and his brand of mayhem has much more to do with brains that technology.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's Evey is an uncomplicated vessel of uncertainty with a strong genetic inclination toward idealism, a perfect companion for the masked vigilante, who has saved her from harm and awakened a woman of substance. Portman headlines the film, finally showing she has the class to act like an intelligent heroine and the beauty to satisfy an audience's penchant for extremes in sci-fi.<br/><br/>Much will be made about the allegorical relevance to Bush/Blair conservatism. Andy Wachowski's screenplay and James McTeigue's direction show hooded prisoners who resemble those at Abu Ghraib, and a neo-fascist chancellor intimidating his citizens with fear of fear. Even his second in command has a resemblance to Dick Cheney, and an ultraconservative TV host looks like Silvio Berlusconi.<br/><br/>With the entrance of Stephen Rea's chief inspector Finch, I knew this would be a complete cinematic success, for I am always haunted by his world-weary Fergus from Crying Game, an actor whose very hang-dog visage suggests a growing awareness of the world's danger and his inability to stop its eventual destruction. But not before V and his league of masked gentlemen have given the neocons a run for the souls of a dystopia only George Orwell could love and Edgar Allen Poe could depict.<br/><br/>""Utopia's quite another land; In her enterprising movements, She is EnglandÂ—with Improvements.""

"biddledown","1","5","19","2 April 2006"," Not even my extremely low expectations were met.
","This was a thoroughly dissatisfying film. In addition to a sophomoric concept (the execution of which was completely devoid of subtlety), the movie suffered for its unrealistic and jarring effects. Little can be said of Hugo Weaving's performance, as he wasn't given very much to work with, but Natalie Portman was embarrassingly bad. It's evidenced in her apparent inability to close her mouth or unfurl her brow that she's been taking cues from Selma Hayek, making her character look as irretrievably stupid and confused as possible. Even more unfortunately, John Hurt didn't seem opposed to applying similar techniques, producing an effect that could just have easily been rendered by the placing of a bold and flashing text box reading ""I AM ANGRY!"" right along side his gigantic, bobbing head.<br/><br/>Stephen Fry, who one should think would exercise caution after that terrific flop, Bright Young Things, once again disappoints in a weird and unnecessary role as a gay man who, for reasons best known to the Wachowskis, is also an avid reader of the Koran.<br/><br/>The portrayal of a ""totalitarian state"" was poorly developed and I had no idea what I was looking at. It seems that the few vague mentions of curfew are intended to fully represent the impediment of these peoples' civil liberties. This whole hypothetical world, not far enough removed from the actual world to create the kind of climate that could possibly produce civil unrest on scale with that in the movie, just seems like the ""real world"", but with larger television screens and John Hurt's aforementioned wrinkly visage floating all over the place.<br/><br/>At first I was outraged that the filmmakers were underestimating their audience, but regretfully, after reading the user comments on IMDb, I must admit that they may actually have been regarding it too highly."

"wjwc","10","2","5","21 June 2015"," A film where a government takes control and a man in a mask gives messages to revolt.
","*****This review contains spoilers***** V for Vendetta is a film where a man in a mask sends out messages to the citizens of how they should revolt against the unfair rules of the government. The tyrannous chancellor is trying hard to keep his rule over the people as more and more people want to overthrow him to become their own government. <br/><br/>The visual effects are amazing. V's special skill of knife throwing and fighting have shown to be spectacular with the trail effects from the knives when thrown. The film has great effects from the explosions including the fireworks shown with the explosions. The V symbol made from the fireworks was, in my opinion, grand.<br/><br/>The music was perfect in many ways for the film. It had the right beat and the right temp for many parts of the film. *****Spoiler*****the ""Overture 1812"" by Tchaikovsky was played when V set the explosions off for the Big Ben Tower. His death, although was sad, I thought was unnecessary since Evey Hammond and the inspector Eric Finch were the only people in the film who saw his death. His death could have been shown to the citizens and created a more heart felt role knowing a savior has died to bring justice to the people.<br/><br/>The lighting and angles were my favorite parts other than the plot. The streets were dark like in dark times, yet had street lights well enough to show details and the characters faces. The fight scenes had good lighting where it was not too bright so the viewers could see the trails made from the bullets and the thrown knives. The angles of the fight scenes were in perfect sequence with the fight scenes. And with the explosions of the buildings there was a good sight of each explosion. The fight scene at the end had a good view of V as the men fired their weapons at him. Then the angles changed with each movement V did with each knife he used against each man. <br/><br/>The only part I would say was troubling was how V spoke. His words were different than how we speak today. For many viewers this can get complicated. I understood what V was speaking of every instance in the movie but he could tend to use big words that some people could never use or hear. I do not call anyone stupid for not understanding. Even I can misunderstand certain things."
"Alex_Hodgkinson","8","2","5","8 April 2014"," V for Virtuoso
","I don't usually do this, but I think I'll have to base this review on comparing this film with the graphic novel written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd. The concept of 'V for Vendetta' was genius and fresh. The story was complex and pushed many ideas into the world. While the film was an excellent adaptation of the book and use many of the same ideas, it didn't use them all. It missed a few opportunities to say what Alan Moore was trying to say.<br/><br/>'V' was portrayed in the novel as being mysterious and vastly intelligent, hidden by a mask. He never revealed his plans and full intentions to Evie. He was dark and in many ways just as bad as the antagonists. I believe that Alan Moore was trying to say that the protagonist isn't an all-good hero, just a man who has flaws just like everyone else. In the film, V (Hugo Weaving) was portrayed as a more romantic figure. He wasn't as mysterious and was much more open to Evie (Natalie Portman). He was still dark, but he did appear to be an all-good, higher than man figure. Someone who had no flaws. A hero.<br/><br/>Another idea that was pushed by Alan Moore was that the man behind the mask of V was just flesh and blood, but he followed an idea. Men can die, but ideas cannot. This is pushed at the end of the novel when Evie puts on the mask and becomes 'V' herself, replacing the previous man in the mask. In the film, this does not happen. Sure, the idea doesn't die, but it again portrays V as an above-man figure. Once he dies, nobody replaces him. He is not just a man. But that was not the original genius idea behind the character 'V'. V is just a man, not a superhero or a god. This is why his amazing fighting upsets me to a degree. He shouldn't be skilled in almost any field, he really is just a man.<br/><br/>While there are these flaws and a few others (such as Mr. Finch's (Stephen Rea) ending and being naive throughout the whole movie instead of becoming stronger), the film still does adapt the novel nearly perfectly. It pushes many of the same ideas, such as ""Government should be afraid of its people"" and ""Ideas are bulletproof"". In fact, the film does many things better, in my opinion. Such as the ending. While the novel had a great ending, I think the film, where everyone gathered wearing masks identical to V's and the Houses of Parliament blowing up as a finale, has a much better one.<br/><br/>Possibly the best thing about the film is James McTeigue's directing. The dark atmosphere is almost exactly like David Lloyd's. David Lloyd did an excellent job at creates realistic, dark images. He made a perfect, cinematic look for the book. Something that fitted 'V for Vendetta' perfectly. James McTeigue brings that to life. He takes David Lloyd's dark, cinematic look and puts it into film. The scenes are all very similar, with their gritty look. The directing is something you simply cannot be disappointed about. It fits both the graphic novel and the film perfectly.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe that Andy and Lana Wachowski did an absolutely amazing job at bringing 'V for Vendetta' to film. They're writing does indeed closely follow Alan Moore's. It does have many things missing, but the film should have a faster pace than the book and they cannot fit everything into two hours. James McTeigue did a perfect job at recreating David Lloyd's illustrations. The acting is brilliant from most actors, which is to be expected, given that most are well known. The only disappointments were that a few key ideas were missing from the novel and that the film seemed slightly to fast, taking away some impact that was needed. I love this adaptation, something that rarely happens in my case.<br/><br/>I'm undecided on whether this film deserves an 8/10 or a 9/10.<br/><br/>(If you were wondering, 'virtuoso' is a person who is extremely skilled in basically any field. I used this word because, as stated above, I believe film V is above-man and too skilled, unlike the novel)"

It just points out what you've always been seeing but never watching. The movie talks with no rambling. Anyone can get the message. There are lots of movies with heroes in it, but there are only a few that at a point people become the hero. This is what makes this movie stand out from many others.

","Some would call ""V for Vendetta"" overtly dramatic. They would be well to remember the fact that the symbol of drama is a mask. With the protagonist being a man in a mask, the outlandishness of this way of thinking is more than highlighted.<br/><br/>That being said, for those who do not know: V for Vendetta was a graphic novel published circa 1983 by Vertigo Comics, written and illustrated by Alan Moore and David Lloyd respectively. The book follows Evey Hammond in the England of the not so distant future where, after a significantly devastating war only briefly mentioned, hatred, bigotry and fascism reigned supreme and now fester throughout England. Evey is out late one night prostituting when she meets V, a man in a Guy Fawkes mask and outfit who speaks in quotes and figurative language, a man of pure symbolism and culture. Without spoiling much, the story follows the escalation and ultimate unleashing the people's fury a la the symbolic domino arrangement of his symbol seen both in the novel and film. The former features much more ""relevant meanwhiles"" or subplots concerning other key characters and their awakenings, so to speak. The film only features a few of these to find balance and be entertaining, but has a reputation for balancing these factors properly which are very clearly shown. James McTeigue, director and apprentice of the Wachowski brothers(The Matrix Trilogy) who wrote the screenplay indubitably had their things in order when they fabricated this masterpiece.<br/><br/>The cinematography, effects and script were all paramount to the film's atmosphere and fit like one of V's gloves. They are dark yet vibrant, and generally do their job to the fullest extend of the word in a simple but elegant manner. Nothing less should be expected and nothing more can be hoped for, they delivered.<br/><br/>Lastly was Hugo Weaving's performance. As V, he delivered some of the most complicated lines and personality in a character ever encountered thus far, and he does so flawlessly and deserves an Academy Award.<br/><br/>Overall this film was outstanding, beyond true enough to its source material(which is struggled with by many other adaptations). The film and graphic novel alike have a very numerous cult following and have for a long time. As one fellow critic says, ""Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. In the meantime, go see this movie. """

","Revolution can be moral and justified is the message of this film, something that America in the age of anti-terrorism, pro-war fanaticism has forgotten. And, the message is painted vividly in the bright colors of a graphic novel, with the delightful detail of Tim Burton sets, and with great action shots reminiscent of the Matrix. Weaving and Portman provide beautiful, though underrated performances, along with several other well known actors who were slighted merely as a result of their participation in the project. That makes the film not unlike a more recent project, Atlas Shrugged, which sadly did not have the budget to produce a film of this quality. V for Vendetta is, however, the movie, not the novel, that Atlas Shrugged could have been if it had been updated for 21st-century American and 21st-century American audiences. It is probably the most seditious, and effective, piece of pro-liberty/anti-government promotion since Common Sense. Neocons, socialists, and corporatists (or do I repeat myself?) will hate it alike. Tea Partiers, Ron Paul supporters, libertarians, as well as true liberal progressives and anarchists -- liberty lovers, and intelligent action film fans, of all stripes -- will love it."
"MairegChernet","9","2","5","7 November 2008"," V for Vendetta...it didn't end with the matrix.
","Years after their biggest hit The Matrix, The Wachowski Brothers make a return with this masterpiece. Directed by a rather not-so-popular director James McTeigue, V for vendetta, portrays a single man's effort to battle the totalitarian government of his time. Combined with dazzling visuals, (those that resemble that of the matrix trilogy) V for vendetta portrays the theme of persistence and devotion throughout the film and does it extremely well. The actors, as well, play their roles so well that viewers might confuse the protagonist to the antagonist. We see this masked man in a killing spree. Yet his background leads us to sympathizing with him. And the dogma of the government makes even the cruelest and goriest measures taken by the masked rebel just.<br/><br/>V for vendetta features two main characters by the names of V (Weaving) and Evey (Portman). V is the main protagonist, (or so he wants us to think so). He is the rebel who's battling the totalitarian government of Great Britain. His main goal is to overthrow the government, and to end the tyranny that has caused him to wear the Guy Fawkes mask. In doing so he needs an ally to help alongside. Than he meets Evey, a young woman whose family was devastated by the government, and has held a grudge ever since. The two spend time together, learning about one anotherand almost turning the rather violent film into a sweet romantic one.<br/><br/>One aspect of the film that's consistent throughout is the devoted and determined persona of the protagonist. V, the main protagonist, seemed unrelenting in his efforts to achieve his goal. The idea of devotion is demonstrated throughout the film. However, devotion and consistency is not shown not only by V but also by those who want to see him dead, those that are after an invincible hero, and those that are after men pro-freedom and pro-individual rights.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the film that would take viewers by awe is the spectacular special effects. The bloody and gory action scenes were incredibly perfect and the Wachowski brothers, even though they didn't direct the film, bring back the atmosphere they created in a movie they directed almost a decade ago, The Matrix. Every action scene in this film is overwhelmingly violent, and just as satisfying.<br/><br/>Last but not least is the daunting performances of the main cast, starting from the dedicated fighter V played by Hugo Weaving, who rocks his role again, just as he did playing Agent Smith, and this time behind a mask. Natalie Portman also plays a character who is naïve, trustworthy, and has a miserable background. John Hurt also plays a wonderful role playing the extremely aristocratic leader Adam Sutler who would destroy anyone who would go against him.<br/><br/>Overall, V for Vendetta remains to be one of the best of its kind, with a brief insertion of humor and lots of bloodshed and violence, combined with a strong message about commitment, friendship and the battle for freedom. Wachowski Brothers did it again."

Thats why they have to give a 100% ""Pro Terrorism Movie"" a low ranking.<br/><br/>2) They do not understand that this is a comic adaption with comic characters. There don't need to be something realistic. Like Sci-Fi it has to be logically inside it's own created universe and it is. The failures (like a few chronological errors in the Jordan Tower scene) are just so minor that they are irrelevant. Or in terrorism slang: It's just collateral damage.<br/><br/>3) They are expecting an action movie. As the trailer looked like one. I personally wish that there had been more dialogs and drama instead of the action parts.<br/><br/>So from my point its a clear 10/10."

","There are good aspects to this film. And then there are bad. The good includes the story (set in the future where the government controls the population, removing privilege's such as freedom, food, opposition), the twists and turns in the plot, the filming (its spectacular to the eyes if nothing else), and certain characters and actors playing those roles (Stephen Fry, for example). However, the first 30 minutes of this film, though full of action, failed to grip me (maybe there should have been an explanation at the start about what was going on exactly), Natalie Portman's acting failed to convince me (and I'm a fan of hers usually!), the love story between the two main characters was bizarre, and sometimes it becomes rather difficult to work out exactly what is going on. It's a good film, but had the potential to be so much better. Hope they may do a re-make in 20 years or so that would be worthy of a 5 star rating."

","First, contrary to the comments of this movie scaring Republicans, I think it is more fighting to Democrats. Having the government provide for all you needs, giving you what they feel you need, telling you what to do and when, and what you can think, give them the ownership of the citizen. This is, I am afraid, in our near future. Reguardless of all that, I had never read the comic book, nor did I have any idea of what to expect from the movie. To put it mildly, I was stunned. This movie contains some of the best written lines, delivered by the very best actors in the business, today. How this movie was passed by for an Academy on several levels is beyond me. One of the greatest movies, easily a masterpiece in the arena of Last of The Mohigans, or Brotherhood of the Wolf. It appears our critics of the motion picture society had been subject to so much junk, for so long, they no longer can tell a Mona Lisa from a child's finger painting. This is one incredible movie.

Of course there have been films about rebellion and revolution, like The Postman and Waterworld, where an apocalyptic world of senseless violence by either a government or a force pushes a man over the edge.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving is brilliant as the Freedom Fighter, V and even Natalie Portman shines as a strong woman with a good enough English accent unlike many films where they are not. The story itself brings you to tears almost, men and women with diverse sexualities tortured and executed by a Totalitarian government along with Races and Faiths that differ from White/Christians.<br/><br/>V stands up to this government and makes his message clear, enough is enough.

","Great cinematography, moving performances, a crackling script that takes you on an emotional and intellectual roller-coaster ride - rarely does a film manage to hold up a mirror to the age and entertain so magnificently at the same time. Shame on the award-givers for passing this over. England (certainly not Britain, as England here seems to have gone UDI on the rest of the UK) presented as a totalitarian state has engendered comparisons with Orwell's 1984, but this is much more akin to Animal Farm; it is a parable of the consequences of human failing and inaction on a societal scale, and the possibility of redemption for an individual. The filmmakers make brave choices - let the dialogue race ahead, don't ever show what is behind the mask. Is it churlish to point out one or two missed beats? Stephen Fry's character worked too hard to disguise his true nature, and was too canny in his dealings with the regime, to not realise the repercussions that would ensue from his satirical TV sketch. That episode served merely to propel Evey back to V. The resurrection of some characters for the mass discarding of the masks at the end was also a little bit too Brechtian for my tastes. Not perfect then, but damn close. V for Vendetta will move you to tears and make you ponder just how much England has really 'progressed' since 1605. England prevails?"

","The plot is like a giant web that connects all the characters and involves them, whether they wish to be involved or not. It is about a hero/villain named V who seeks vengeance against those who hurt and disfigured him. Evey Hammond gets involved in the plot when she tries to visit her boss and is almost hurt by fingermen. V rescues her and brings her with him to the site where he explodes the Old Bailey. After that, she is involved whether she wants to be or not, because the police think she is a suspect.<br/><br/>This film is intelligent and engrossing. I always come away from it thinking about the themes of the story and how they pertain to history. While this movie came out in the U.S, there was some talk about how it, and other films, were somehow protesting what the Bush administration was doing.

Of course this sort of thing could never happen in the United States. A brilliant cast, led by Hugo Weaving in possibly his finest role, with an electrifying performance by Natalie Portman. Also quite excellent were John Hurt, Stephen Rea, Tim Piggott Smith, Stephen Fry and John Standing. Besides the excellent action of the film was the inventive use of the English Language and the symphony of poetic expression which brought so much to the film. I had not read the graphic novel, and I am glad because it allowed me to see the film without preconceptions. I was also happy to see scenes from the ""Count of Monte Cristo"" from the 1930s which happens to be one of my favorite all time films.

","After what I considered to be disappointing Matrix sequels, the Wachowski brothers bring to life a graphic novel that hits closer to our current society than one would think.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a masked man who begins to terrorize what has become a totalitarian government in a not too distant future in London, England. He tells of his plan to detonate a bomb that will destroy the British Parliament in a year's time. In the meanwhile he exposes the dark and secretive history of some of the government's highest ranking officials, which fuel his vengeance and also explain his past. The masked ""V"" befriends a young broadcast worker (Portman), who he confides in to help him with his destructive plans. She struggles between living in the flawed world she knows and rebelling against it to make some semblance of change.<br/><br/>First-time director James McTeige brings with him a wealth of knowledge on how to craft this sci-fi tale, having been an assistant director on the Matrix films. The visual stylization makes every frame feel like it is jumping right out of the comic book. Plus, beautiful special effects that are not overly-gratuitous. While you never see his face, Hugo Weaving's delightful voice shines through V's mask. I could not think of any other person I would have playing this part. Weaving gives the character such a human depth that you can almost see the expressionless mask he wears, show emotion. Natalie Portman, who plays V's confidant Evey, also gives a surprisingly deep performance and a flawless British accent to boot. Stephen Rea and John Hurt also round out an excellent cast.<br/><br/>While the film's conclusion is somewhat rushed, Vendetta as a whole is a brilliant piece of science fiction, uniquely blending fantasy with today's reality."

","i think this movie is one of the best i have ever seen. I saw the IMAX version, blown up to 25 meters I can't imagine it can look better. The beauty of the images, incredible. It is maybe part of the big impact this movie had on me. But of course most important, the message. Clearly this movie is about the world of today. The problems if a leader or a system becomes too powerful. They will never give up the power without a battle. The power of this moment, money, is strong and the people who posses it will protect it. With false claims about terrorism new nice laws can be introduced and give even more power to the already powerfully, reduce democratic rights and private lives of the normal citizen even more. Every enemy has to be eliminated. Most people still believe it and sleep happy with all there possessions, there beautiful car, house and other stuff which we think need to be happy. In this way we are so happy we never see the real problems of this world. In V for Vendetta there is enough to see to make the link to this world. But more important; V for Vendetta shows us how a whole nation can change his her mind, awakens and together stops believing the nonsense of the leaders. Can V for vendetta be the start of a new non political movement, exactly the way 'V' should like it?<br/><br/>In the movie 'V' says; 'the people need not to be afraid of the government, The government should be afraid of the people.' <br/><br/>Still i don't believe everybody understands this movie. I can hardly believe the young guys in the movies admire the political issues of it. Happily there there are enough big explosions to make them happy. Still unbelievable this 'difficult' movie gets 8 points. It makes me sure happy to see that there are hundred thousand of other people who see the truth of this moment, it give hope for the future."

","""V for Vendetta"" is an amazing movie. It has everything you would want in a movie: great acting, visually stunning, and it is even thought provoking. ""V for Vendetta"" will not be compared to the original graphic novel, Alan Moore, because this reviewer had not had a chance to read it. With the writing styles of Andy and Larry Wachowski and the directing of first time director, James McTeigue, this movie is something that cannot be missed.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" is a graphic novel written by Alan Moore. This movie tells the story about Evey Hammond and her unlikely but instrumental part in bringing down the fascist government that has taken control of a futuristic Great Britain. Saved from a life-and-death situation by a man in a Guy Fawkes mask, who calls himself V, she learns a general summary of V's past. She then attempts to help him bring down those who committed the atrocities that led to Britain being in the shape it is in.<br/><br/>What makes this movie different from your average Hollywood movie is that ""V for Vendetta"" is very well written. This movie is so thought provoking that it has the potential for many hours of discussion after viewing the movie. Not many films can do that and still give you enough action to make it not boring. It has a powerful, yet very controversial, realistic message about what could happen in the near future. There will be no more discussions about this film, or its message, in the review, it is something you should view yourself and determine whether you agree with the message they are trying to convey.<br/><br/>The acting was fantastic. Natalie Portman proves that, she can still deliver a strong performance, and she does as Evey Hammond. Her acting ability was definitely not shown in George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy. The real star of this movie is Hugo Weaving as the masked V. It is unbelievable how three-dimensional a masked character could be. John Hurt did well, yet at times overacted, as the leader of the country, Adam Sutler. Stephen Rea's character, Finch, was also done very well.<br/><br/>There really is not much bad to say about this movie. If you had to choose some, it would be mainly Natalie Portman's accent. The accent was shaky, at times it was great, but at other times it was horrible. Another complaint you may have is about the films marketing. The trailer made it look like a ""Matrix"" action type movie, which it is not. There where some good action scenes, especially one near the end, but it did not last throughout the whole movie like the trailers made you think.<br/><br/>Overall, if you want to see a good film done right, go, at least, rent ""V for Vendetta."" If you do not like this film, it is easier to recommend a movie like ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" There is not much else say about this movie, without spoilers, so go out and see this. You will love it! ""V for Vendetta"" is recommended!"

Of course we can think of 1984 and Big Brother who has become the High Chancellor. Of course we can think of Zorro or Batman who have become V. Of course we can think of so many other films (try The Running Man for instance, or Total Recall) that have been dealing with the end of a world turned into an absolutely totalitarian dictatorship. The apocalypse of another apocalypse, an apocalyptic end to a catastrophic apocalypse. So what does this film bring us that is new ? A touch of optimism. A real change is possible when and only when the people starts moving, and the people will move if you provide them with some hope by destroying a few symbolic milestones in their everyday political landscape. Optimistic. And imagine the armed forces of such an absolutely fascistic regime not firing at the crowd that is coming unarmed and numerous. Optimistic. Is it good to have a little dose of optimism from time to time ? Maybe. Yet the film is interesting and both thrilling and entertaining. But it does not provide us with any real belief that this may happen in our world. Fascism can take over but it is always  today  in mild forms though the deeper nature is brutal and ruthless : they prefer famishing and starving someone through economic means to sending them to any concentration camp. But to revive Guy Fawkes is a real fine idea. He is so British, so English, so cute and quaint. Guy Fawkes is not even a skeleton in the British cupboard, or cabinet if your prefer. He is a real friend that we may meet at any street corner of our mind or imagination.

","On the surface, it doesn't seem like ""V for Vendetta"" has any more to offer than a few dozen other comic strips turned feature films. We have the tortured, brooding superhero with otherworldly powers; the beautiful damsel-in-distress who he rescues and dotes over; the over-the-top villain lusting for world domination.<br/><br/>What distinguishes this film to some extent are the interesting twists given to these familiar roles. The superhero V (Hugo Weaving) is an anarchist-terrorist. He seems more interested in personal vengeance than in righting any wrongs. His damsel Evie (Natalie Portman) is meek and subversive. In a vicious plot twist she is transformed into a woman of substance and character.<br/><br/>John Hurt, in a reversal of his role as Winston Smith in ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"", chews ample scenery as the lead villain, Chancellor Adam Sutler. The idea of a corrupt politician is hardly new. But the totalitarian regime he presides over in the very near future is unsettling and uncomfortably plausible. All that is needed is the lemming-like allegiance of the populace that some would say is the crux of American society.<br/><br/>Throw in adult themes such as rape and homosexuality and you have some pretty heady stuff for a comic book. Although based on a series by Alan Moore, he refused any connection to the film, claiming it wasn't true to his vision. This leaves all the credit to the producers, Larry and Andy Wachowski of ""The Matrix"" trilogy fame. Comic aficionados themselves, they again show their ability to borrow characters and plots to create their own vision.<br/><br/>The problem with this genre is that besides action and comic buffs there isn't much for the rest of the movie-going audience to appreciate. The characters are so off the chart that it's difficult to relate to them on a level other than disbelief. Weaving does a fine job of conveying emotion from behind a Guy Fawkes mask the entire movie. But nothing in this film has the emotional impact as when Peter Weller as ""Robocop"" returns to his vacant home. Everyone could feel how Robo felt at that moment, and the connection was immediate. ""V"" is fine as entertainment, but like most comic movies it falls short, and by much more than one little inch it begs for."

","Was anyone else reminded by this movie of ""the Abominable Dr. Phibes"" with Vincent Price? Both V and Phibes are shadowy masked anti-heroes picking people off one by one (both cases have a similar nurse as a victim), with a beautiful assistant and cool nostalgic hidden lair. Both are acting out vendettas, with only one detective who is piecing it all together, but can he do it in time? He just barely catches up in the end but the antihero escapes into death in each. Having read the graphic novel and a Moore interview long ago, I know that Alan Moore was a little inspired by Phibes in designing the hideout, but that's all he admitted to. I'm not saying he lifted the plot or anything, as V has much more to say, but I've never noticed all the similarities until today. If you haven't seen ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes"", go rent or buy it today! Don't worry if you never see the sequel though."

","I have to say that watching this film on a long flight from London to Newark was kind of interesting. The Guy Fawkes masks were unpleasant to look at but it had another meaning. Imagine a world run by John Hurt's character, what brilliant casting that was to cast him. Remember he starred as Winston in the George Orwell novel based film, 1984, in 1984. Well anyway, he was perfect as the ruthless British dictator. I only caught the last hour of it but I can tell it was a great film filmed in London and Germany. His ruling party is basically a fascist culture much like the Nazis. They close the London Underground or at least they think. V is the mysterious guy in a mask who captures and releases Evie played by Natalie Portman. Ironic that they filmed this movie in Germany of all places but that's another story. Anyway, V is seen as a villain in the beginning until Stephen REa from the Crying Game begins to understand him as well as Evie does. It's a weird love story between Evie and V. I am giving it a 9 because I wanted to see V's face."

","I was practically speechless after watching this movie. I thought it was going to be just another action flick my 20-year-olds rent on DVD, but I was wrong. The acting is incredibly good -- Hugo Weaving, even with a mask, is flawless. How he expresses with his voice and inflection his anger, sadness, happiness, love...he's just incredible. Natalie Portman was great, and I don't think I could find a cast member that wasn't -- Inspector Finch was fabulous, too. The music, scenery, dialogue, and THEME...this is a MUST SEE!<br/><br/>I had heard previously this was compared to the Matrix. Whereas the Matrix has some great action scenes, there is just no comparison. This movie tells a very real story, and seems to parallel what could have happened if things turned out differently after WWII, and gives you a scary glimpse of what could happen when government does not represent the people."

","After the first appearance of V in this movie where he introduces himself, I thought to myself, ""If this is a taste of the quality of dialogue to come, I'm in for a very good movie."" Well, I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to describe this movie as it's as fresh a movie as I've seen in a long time. There's no 'gratuitous' Hollywood stuff in here unless you think great dialogue is gratuitous. V for Vendetta delivers great performances, a great story, great pacing, suspense, mystery, action and this movie tugs at the hearts, morals, desires and principles that are at the root of us all.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman are absolutely stellar. Each, imho, are perfectly cast in their roles. Weaving especially, delivers what I can only describe as a ""mesmerizing"" or even ""hypnotizing"" performance. Hugo deserves an Oscar for this one imho. I think good movies make me care for the characters in them, but great movies make me 'respect' the characters in them. Character is also a good word to describe V for Vendetta.<br/><br/>This movie has an ""epic"" feel to it without having, what seems like today has become status quo, epic battle scenes. Everything in this movie feels like it's done on a epic scale, but a non-ethereal scale. The mood, the story and the idea of this movie will definitely make you think and feel in grand ways.<br/><br/>I think this is one of the few movies I would recommend that any person see, no matter what genre of movies they are into. Even if you don't like V for Vendetta, I have a hard time imagining anyone not 'respecting' it.<br/><br/>I voted 8/10 for this, but I clicked too fast, it gets a 9/10 vote from me.

The movie is exceptionally thought provoking and well put together.<br/><br/>Though graphic at a few points, it is for dramatis and works well.<br/><br/>Immediately upon finishing, I wanted to watch again, but the more overriding feeling was to let it sink in for a few days and think about all of the nuances.<br/><br/>It is not a movie for everyone: too young and it will be under-appreciated and the subtleties will be missed-- too old and the graphic and dramatic nature may put off some and close their minds.<br/><br/>Keep your mind open and enjoy the Wachowski's best movie yet- and perhaps one of the top films of the year, or even decade."
"usenet69","9","2","5","3 August 2006"," Use of Power Voice was fantastic
","One of the most remarkable features of this movie was the use of POWER VOICE. For those that do not know what power voice is - POWER VOICE is one of the techniques taught to and used by leaders (manipulators). <br/><br/>Usually people have an UPWARD intonation at the end of sentences. The more impulsive and ""friendly"" a person, usually the more UPWARD the intonation at the end of each Sentence. One of the vocal ways to manipulate and overpower those under you (and many equal or higher than you), is to use the Power Voice method. There are 5 features to this POWER VOICE and they are overwhelming when used correctly although they are also undetected by the average person who falls prey to it. The 5 features are: <br/><br/>1. Talk with a low (bass) voice if you can. 2. Talk slower than usual. 3. ALWAYS INTONE THE END OF YOUR SENTENCES DOWN (IF POSSIBLE GRAMATICALLY) 4. Give an extra half to full second REST between sentences. 5. Talk softer than usual. This makes people listen better in order to hear.<br/><br/>As I have said. This has a devastating effect on people. I use it in my office when calling wrongdoers in. No hysterical shouting or crap-outs. Soft quiet POWER VOICE. It scares the hell out of them. <br/><br/>One of the people that perfected this was Sir Anthony Hopkins. He has used this in many of his movies. This was used by him in MEET JOE BLACK, AND by DEATH in Joe Black. This is why V sounds so much like Brad Pitt in the movie. POWER VOICE. <br/><br/>It also touches some political issues which are very unspoken. Britain using its weapons against its own people. Very much like the suggestion that the US government used and formulated the 911 attacks against their own people to get them to fall in line. <br/><br/>COmmunists use it in countries such as South Africa. They allow the country to fall into anarchy and crime and at the moment when the population is freaked out by fear they come with the solution. The population then show their THANKS to their GOVERNMENT for saving them while in actual fact that government just gave them back what was theirs - their freedom. This method was invented by the clever communists when the found that the only other way to mass control people, namely direct violence, generated to much opposition. This method of brainwashing used by the UK, USA and in countries such as South Africa is much safer. It makes people give up their freedom and rights voluntarily without to much resistance and without even realizing what they are doing. Look at the laws on Homeland Security in the USA for instance.<br/><br/>Just my view."

"HermioneSnape","10","2","5","2 August 2006"," Powerful, beautiful, disturbing, rousing--a 10 all the way.
","Occasionally, a movie is released that is far beyond the scope of most others--a movie that affects and haunts for days, weeks, months after the initial viewing. For me, ""V for Vendetta"" is one of those films.<br/><br/>It has received much criticism from all sides: ardent fans of the graphic novel are outraged at the plot modifications made for the film adaptation; some claim that the movie's ideas are too abrasive, while others protest that the filmmakers took the easy way out and didn't exploit the graphic novel's themes to their greatest capacity. But in my opinion, while all these points are valid to some extent, their bearers are missing the point.<br/><br/>When I first saw ""V,"" I was immediately and profoundly struck by the beauty of the imagery. The film was beautifully shot--the desolate gray of oppressed London contrasted with the lush reds and earth tones of the eclectic Shadow Gallery being one such example. Simplistic, yes...but effective. The obvious parallels between V's and Evey's dual personal journeys and discoveries were also very effectively portrayed on-screen.<br/><br/>The action scenes (in the alley, at Jordan Tower, at Victoria Station) were stylish and slick. Some complain that they are unnecessarily flashy and too similar to fight scenes from ""The Matrix"" films, but we ARE talking about the Wachowski brothers here, so I'm not sure what else they were expecting. I found these scenes to be excitedly choreographed and riveting.<br/><br/>Acting from all participants is superb. Natalie Portman is excellent as Evey Hammond, despite the fact that I thought her accent to be a bit inconsistent. Then again, this was not so great an error as to subtract from my viewing experience. The character of Evey is at first naive and quite commonplace, and Portman rather skillfully portrays her transformation from a frightened citizen to the protégé of a revolutionary. Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch is also excellent--we can see the weight of the world on his shoulders and in his sad eyes; we can feel and sympathize with the unfortunate circumstance of being the good cop in a bad world. Through both him and Evey, we can witness the transpiring events in a very human, personal way.<br/><br/>The most outstanding performance, however, goes without a doubt to Hugo Weaving as V, the brooding, brilliant, and rather mad anti-hero. Even though he remains behind the restrictive black clothing and rigid mask for the duration of the film, Weaving manages to imbue his character with more charisma and tragic bravado than one could imagine. I was completely entranced by his performance, torn between revulsion of his characters' vengeful acts and incredible pity for the severe injustices dealt him; Weaving portrays both sides of V with conviction. The cautious, fractured relationship between V and Evey is handled delicately and with much discretion. It is painful and skewed and unpleasant, but is at times laced with such heartbreaking tenderness that you can't help but ache for what might have been.<br/><br/>Dario Marianelli (Pride & Prejudice - 2005, The Brothers Grimm) composed an exemplary score that, in my opinion, is nearly as powerful as the film itself. There are not any over-the-top and intricate themes and perhaps only two true action cues, but the subtleties, the nuances of the album are staggering and poignant. A tender theme for Evey first appears in ""Evey's Story"": simple and heartbroken. A rousing four-chord progression is first heard in ""Governments...People"" and builds to ecstatic heights in ""Evey Reborn""--a theme for V, a secondary theme for Evey, a theme for the revolution itself? Perhaps all three. It is a raw and cautious and dark score--the tender piano in ""Valerie"" and the aforementioned progression in ""Evey Reborn""--almost desperate in its urgency--never cease to send shivers through me.<br/><br/>Yes, in adapting the graphic novel to film, plots were omitted and characters were modified. People should keep in mind, however, that the graphic novel and the film are meant to be two different things, and should be enjoyed as such. Yes, the topics discussed and explored can be unpleasant; however, this should stop no one from enjoying what is essentially a film that speaks boldly about battling one's inner demons and cherishing the beauty in the world; about hope, justice, courage, fear, and perhaps most importantly, love.<br/><br/>Quite simply...don't miss this film. If I could give it an 11, I would."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","5","2","5","28 June 2006"," B for Boring, S for Standard, and so on...
","James McTeigue probably intended his 'V for Vendetta' to be a dark and thrilling adaptation of Alan Moore's futuristic graphic novels. Kind of like Sin City, but much more political and intelligent. I am sorry to say he failed in so many ways, because this was simply half-assed and standard.<br/><br/>I don't know what's wrong with Natalie Portman nowadays, but she seems to get progressively worse at acting. I have always thought she was one of the more convincing on-screen criers in Hollywood, but she can't pull off a normal vocal performance for toffee. Let me put it like this, if you were impressed by Kevin Costner's accent in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, you will be blown away by Portman in this film. Her fake ""English"" accent made my ears bleed. The two StephensRea and Frywere really great, but not great enough to compensate for Portman's poor acting as she undoubtedly had the bigger part and more screen time.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I did not care for the overly eloquent character of V or his corny dialogue. This is typical of something that may have worked on paper, but did not work on screen. The twist in the film, if you want to call it that, was rather predictable (and I am rarely good at anticipating plot-twists). The fight scenes were unoriginal, borrowing from The Matrix, and there was no excitement because you knew who was going to win every timeand this, without having read any of the graphic novels.<br/><br/>The ideas that V for Vendetta put forward are interesting but certainly not new. The ideas of a totalitarian state changing its history records to control its citizens should ring a bell to anyone who's read anything by Orwell, Bradbury or Huxley. Alan Moore who wrote the graphic novels asked to have his name removed from the movie for reasons that should be quite obvious if you've watched it. The film did not leave much room up for interpretation, and opted for the usual 'preachy' Hollywood directing style. That is, it told you what to think every step of the way. Although I must admit that the loud booming playing of the1812 Overture was one of the best uses of classical music in a movie."

","This film totally blew my expectations out of the water. I expected it to be a normal, run-of-the-mill action flick like The Matrix 2 and 3, but V for Vendetta is much, much more. This movie is about the totalitarian society of now superpower Britain(A little on the way-side, but cool). The British Chancellor has decided to use this power to oppress his people, curfews, no free media, keeping tabs on every citizen(ahem...)That kind of thing. Many want freedom, but the laws are so strict and the enforcers of those laws are so brutal no-one dares to speak against this corrupt society, except for one person. That person is V(played by Hugo Weaving). He's got a grudge against the Government and exacts his revenge by killing each person who made this nation so awful and destroyed his life. In comes Natalie Portman's character, Evey. She works for the national television station. One night when she breaks curfew, she is saved from the police by V and is brought to see a ""concert"". Soon, she falls for V and attempts to help in V's exploits. His main goal is to destroy the building of Parliament as a symbol of when Guy Fawkes attempted to destroy the parliament building to overthrow England in the Seventeenth century hence ""Remember remember the fifth of November"" as the slogan of of the film. At the end, the building is destroyed, the government is destroyed and the movie ends with hope for a better future. Great acting on all of the actors, THE WACHOWSKIS ARE BACK!!!!"

","A beautiful film. If you expect to see a standard comic book action flick, complete with ridiculously costumed villains, totally implausible storyline, and one-dimensional characters lifted straight off the pages - you will be disappointed. Go rent any standard Hollywood tent pole movie and escape into fantasy land again.<br/><br/>If you want to see something unique and different, a film that offers up ideas and roles that are intense, thought-provoking, and timely, then you will NOT be disappointed.<br/><br/>Most comic book fans tend to be unrealistic in their expectations for films in this genre, expecting to see exactly what is written on the hallowed comic page, and when anything is changed....they erupt into volumes of scathing vitriol about the film. What the Wachowskis did with this movie was make it even better than the graphic novel - they injected life into the persona of V, and humanity, which makes it infinitely more believable for me, as a theater-goer. Possibly the original author meant for this story to be more about ANARCHY than anything else, but the Wachowskis and McTeague brought out something much more poignant and meaningful than a mere political system.<br/><br/>The idea of human freedom.<br/><br/>Which I would hope is more important than CGI, special effects, and the amount of fight/action scenes in a movie."
"worldruller1","10","2","5","17 April 2006"," good movie, great story, much better than any other comic movie
","I feel and think that it's sad how a movie like V for vendetta can be so well done and a success on all levels while other movies which come from idea's based on comic books fail miserably in the eyes of the real fans. X men for example is a comic story which was adapted for everyone to see and somehow connect to and to do this they gave the x men leather suits instead of their traditional spandex and a plot so simple that comic fans would have fallen asleep were it is writing and not not he big screen. Because of their attempt to appeal to a mass audience most if not all comic movies come out decent in the best of cases and usually a lot worse which can be seen again and again and again. I believe that if the scriptwriters would stick to what the fans would relate and enjoy a movie which does exactly what it's supposed to do. bring the comic story to the theater in the best form possible. This is one of the reasons that V for Vendetta was so great. It wasn't trying to impress anyone and thats why it made the impact and got the positive reviews it did. Hugo weaving did an amazing job and the dialog is just superb. It cant be denied that the films good taste and detail in plot and filming were Vavaciosly Visible. I voted this a 10 and for it's type of movie I don't think it deserves any less."

See the movie with someone you trust and prepare to be sucked into a dystopia future where 'terrorism' is the rallying cry for the power hungry pukes that always sit waiting in the dark crevices of society. The movie mirrors the current political alignment in the US and doesn't apologize. Nor should it. It pins the blame for the ruin of its homeland squarely on the shoulders of its willfully ignorant populace. I particularly enjoyed the films' depiction of Fox News.

","This film is very good. It is like watching '1984' with a superhero. I thought the acting was great from all involved. Hugo Weaving as V does appear crazy but focused on his task and shows another side when he falls in love with Evey. The head shaving scene with Natalie Portman was very impressive to me, I mean if that goes wrong half way through you can't really re-shoot it. Her accent was also very well done, I found her very convincing as Evey as she develops from an almost 'normal' everyday person to what the character finally becomes What she finally becomes (and the perception of other characters) is individual to the viewer in my opinion. It is difficult to say he is the bad guy, or she is the bad girl and this adds to the appeal of the film.<br/><br/>All sorts of ideas appear in this film regarding subjects such as freedom, torture, conditioning and cults. They are there in enough volume for you to think about them without feeling like you are being force fed someone else's beliefs (maybe that is the highest form of brainwashing!! Are you really making up your own mind?).<br/><br/>I really enjoyed watching this film, and would watch it again more than once, but I guess I will have to wait for the DVD as it has already, surprisingly, finished at the theatre."
"majorwinters-2","10","2","5","15 April 2006"," Let me catch my breath...
","I'm here to add my humble opinion about ""V."" Most people here echo my astonishment and succeeding enthusiasm for this movie. It was ""bloody good!"" Witty, compelling, charismatic, and for an action movie, surprisingly restrained. Despite the fact that it's based on a comic book, I found no awkwardness in the transition. Perhaps I can't really say this absolutely because I've never read the comic. Anyway, the movie is just excellent...unforgettable...begs to be watched more than once. I can't wait to see it again. Hugo Weaving deserves an Oscar for his performance. He delivered those lines as easily as if he were treading the boards and yet I didn't flinch in the face of his verbosity. Rather, I was stunned and then delighted. There was something gentlemanly and poetic about his character, despite his cartoonish appearance. Hugo Weaving created a thoroughly compelling, charismatic anti-hero instead of a campy figure of fun. It was a delicate balance that Weaving masterfully manipulates."

""V"" held strong messages and incredible imagery, and is so wonderfully brilliant that it will make you wonder how mediocre films that are shown everyday in theaters are ever made in-comparison to this film. ""V"" will raise the hairs on your neck and make your blood boil with the aching will to fight. You'll leave this movie wanting only one thing: this movie to never end. A++"

","V for Virtuous, V for Vintage, these are but two words that describe V for Vendetta. V for Vendetta is a surprise package as, in my eyes, it is a lesser know DC comics character but it by no means is punching above it's weight by entering the film world. It can be compared to another DC comics favourite Batman, as Batman Begins is very similar to the way this film is laid out and how the story is told, it's dark, it's mysterious, it's awesome! I have never read the V for Vendetta comic, but I want to now. For a start V (the main character) isn't your average muscle bound, chisel jawed hero. He never takes his mask of, he is very well spoke, loves Shakespeare and isn't your goody goody hero as some people might perceive him as the villain depending on your point of view. The best bits of the film have to be whenever there are loads of bad guys trying to gun V down and he just whips out the knives and slashes a cap. I would of give this film a 10 but it has its flaws namely Natalie Portman's quite lame English accent. All in all a damn good film that I could watch time and time again."
"drk150","10","2","5","12 April 2006"," Awesome movie that covers the spectrum of emotions and will make you think
","V for Vendetta is easily one of the best new movies in several years. It is well-acted, well-directed, has wonderful visual appeal, and will make you think and feel things that other movies won't go near.<br/><br/>Set in the relatively near future in England, the story surrounds a terrorist/freedom fighter known as V who is trying to singlehandedly topple a corrupt government. To say anything more would take away from the movie's element of surprise.<br/><br/>While astute viewers can fairly easily predict some or all of the film's ""twists"", it doesn't matter, because we sympathize with those characters who are kept in the dark. This film does a superb job of making the viewer feel what the characters feel, be it fear, sadness, joy, pride, whatever. The story relies on character emotion and development, not plot gimmicks, and it does a superb job. The 'goal' of the movie is known within the first 20 minutes or so, but we are still kept on the edge of our seats waiting to make sure everything plays out properly.<br/><br/>The most important things this movie does is make the audience think. If you can watch this movie and not see correlations to real-life events, either historical, current, or potential, there's something wrong with you. Some claim that this movie is written as an attack on the current conservative U.S. government. This is unlikely, given that the original comic on which the movie is based was written long before anybody knew who George W. Bush was. Still, V for Vendetta is applicable today and should cause viewers to think what is possible if they allow their government to get out of hand.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta will make you laugh, and it will make you cry. It will make your adrenaline surge and it will crush your spirit. It will make you think. And it will make you want to watch it again."

Bush has finally pushed the luck of the US military campaigns too far, Britain is the new super power of the world and a power-hungry Chancellor oppresses the people to make supposedly perfect society.<br/><br/>This movie was well done, with action sequences that keep your attention throughout. I will admit that things got a little too violent at times, though I've come to expect that from the movies of today. Some historic monuments/buildings are destroyed, though the freedom fighter V does it in resistance of the Totalitarian government without hurting the innocent.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving do excellent jobs as the heroes against the oppressors (as well as bringing actors from the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars trilogies together). I liked the charm of V had when explaining his situations and doing his work, though sadly his words were hard to understand at times. Portman was excellent at displaying perfect emotion in her scenes, be it sadness at V's death or joy that his dream of freedom has finally came true.<br/><br/>This movie may not be for everyone, but it's well worth looking into. It has action, drama, a hilarious section towards the middle, and plenty of clever situations. See it if you don't mind some blood and a few clichés."

The thought of the world becoming the way that it is in this movie is something that often doesn't cross the minds of people, but this movie will make it cross your mind. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I was watching this one. I loved it. Highly recommend it. Go see it."

","Set in a world where the government rules by the use of fear, comes a hero like no other. Dress in a mask, poetic and theatrical in his mannerism and speech but deadly with the dagger, stands the hero V. V is one of this heroes that makes you uncertain; is he a hero or is he a villain? There are parts within the movie that makes you hate V, it makes you want to stand up and scream at him. Then there are other parts of the movie you see a great mind at work as he plans for the things that is to plan.<br/><br/>All and all, one of the best movies I have seen this side of 2006 so far. It can only be describe as the thinking man's superhero. Without any special powers, this movie captures you its intelligence and suspend. There are questions hanging you ask every corner it turns then makes you wait as it slowly reveal the answer to you.<br/><br/>The acting by Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving is excellent. I must admit I am a Natalie Portman fan, but in this movie she absolutely explodes on screen. The rest of the cast has been well selected and fits nicely into the movie. It is definitely a movie I would recommend to anyone."

","The film makes several allusions to the famous Guy Fawkes plot when the Catholics (including Guy Fawkes) placed 36 barrels of gunpowder in a cellar under the palace of Westminster in England. on November 5, 1605, in hopes of improving their lot by blowing up James I and the English Parliament and by placing Elizabeth, daughter of James I, on the English throne as their puppet ruler. However, Fawkes was arrested with the barrels of gunpowder in the tunnel under the House of Lords and was tortured with unspeakable methods until he divulged the names of the conspirators. Lord Salisbury as prime minister then began to use the plot to taint all of the Catholics. The reverberations of this plot contain the energy sustaining V for Vendetta. This film supposes that a similar plot against the present British government is going to lead to another extreme reaction and to the rise of a totalitarian government similar to that found in 1984. V for Vendetta is the underground resistance to that totalitarianism that stoops to using terrorism against the British people to maintain the conditions of its absolute power. The movie is full of pageantry and suspense and mystery. And, V is Zorro on steroids, who fights against overwhelming evil."

","V for Vendetta<br/><br/>There seems to be a common trend in the movie industry lately of comic book movies turning out to be among the most stylishly made and most entertaining movies around. Looking at last year alone, we have Sin City, Batman Begins, A History of Violence, which were all excellently done and supremely entertaining. Following this pattern of hits, we have V for Vendetta, based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore. Vendetta details the story of a totalitarian society in England in the not so distant future, where a mysterious masked man known only as V uses terrorism maneuvers in order to make a poetic point about the state of their society, in the hopes of winning more people to his cause. After saving the life of a young girl (Natalie Portman), V may have found an ally on his quest for revolution and change. <br/><br/>This movie is a fascinating piece of work for so many reasons - there is the political aspect for one, and it is very interesting to notice the daring implied similarities and references to today's U.S. government. The story is endlessly compelling, much moreso than pretty much any movie of its genre lately, and each plot twist leaves us anxiously waiting, at the risk of coining the cliché, but literally at the edge of our seats, waiting to see what happens next. Also, visually, V for Vendetta is pretty much without peer these days - most modern movies are fortunate if they have a single image that stays seared into your memory for a while after viewing - V for Vendetta has a dozen of such images easily, if not more. (for all who have seen it, without giving anyway anything to those who haven't: think of the domino shot now) The cinematography here is particularly noteworthy, and shows incredible imagination and vision that most movies simply lack, sadly enough. <br/><br/>And of course, given that the movie was written by The Wachowski Brothers, there are, of course, several Matrix style fight sequences and a bunch of contrived and philosophical to the point of confusion monologues, mostly spoken by revolutionary V. Fortunately, (or unfortunately I suppose, depending on one's preference) the script for V for Vendetta is nowhere near as incomprehensible as that of the Matrix, which makes the movie a lot easier to follow and enjoy, as it lacks that constant sense that the audience is meant to forever stay two steps behind the plot and be left in the dark forever. V's central belief of an icon being so much more noteworthy than a flesh and blood individual who can be easily dispatched or removed is a particularly interesting concept, one also touched upon in last year's Batman Begins, another highly successful and incredibly well made comic book movie. <br/><br/>On top of everything else, performances are also very impressive throughout, especially from Natalie Portman as the haunted heroine of the story, Evey, proving once again how dedicated as well as incredibly talented an actress she is. Endless praise also deserves to be bestowed upon Hugo Weaving for bringing flesh and blood to the icon of the character V. Despite the difficulty of having facial expressions covered up by his eternally smiling mask, Weaving walks away with yet another iconic character beneath him, following up his last turn with the Wachowskis as Agent Smith in the Matrix. It is astonishing how much character he manages to get across with only his wonderful voice and body language. The movie also boasts a very strong supporting cast, with great performances also from Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, and John Hurt as the leader of future england - a sort of Stalin crossbred with Hitler type of figure, who is seen for the most part as a giant head seen on a huge viewing screen. In his limited yet essential screen time, he makes a wonderful antagonistic figure. <br/><br/>Overall, V for Vendetta is one of the strongest and most entertaining movies in a very long time, following the trend of excellent comic book movies lately. Rest assured the movie's message will stay with you for quite a while after, and don't be surprised to find certain epic images or sequences seared into your head for a while after. V for Vendetta is one of those movies which mixes philosophy and profound critique of modern life with incredibly entertaining, fast paced storyline and exhilarating action sequences - definitely worth seeing, if you have yet to do so! <br/><br/>-10/10"

"shelleykm","9","2","5","5 April 2006"," More complex than an ordinary revenge plot
","After reading reviews and hearing all the commentary on ""V"", I expected a good movie, but not like this! While it is obvious that ""V"" is out for revenge, this movie is not as ""black and white"" as you might think; it's varying shades of gray. I think one of the primary visual clues in the movie is how the color gray dominates the majority of the sets (gray stone, gray metal, etc.). Red is a paradox of color: standing both for life, as in Evey's ""prison garb"" and lipstick she applies in the initial scene, and the constant ""V"" sigils (positive) and blood (negative).<br/><br/>Is injustice done in the name of justice acceptable? Can a lifetime of living within the rules compensate for a short period of ego-driven atrocities? What actions and ideals really separate us from those we despise/oppose? When does the slippery slope of ""legislation in the name of safety"" become a landslide under which we will all be buried alive?<br/><br/>Is it just me, or are there eerie parallels between this and Margaret Atwood's ""Handmaid's Tale""? (Not the movie so much, but more the novel.)<br/><br/>Don't know if I'm sleeping much tonight. :-) Thanks for ""listening."""

","On first look at V for Vendetta I was expecting great things and I was surprised that it delivered more than I could of hoped for.The central characters are strong and well played by Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving, the support cast are outstanding, the production is first class, the lighting is superb and the sets are fantastic but it is the underlying anger and frustration that lies in the mind of the central character, V, that makes this film a must-see. The film was finished in the late part of 2004 and was due for a British release around the time of the London bombings in July 2005, but the distributors decided that the film was too provocative to release after so many people had lost their lives to 'terrorism' in the capital city where the film takes place. I can understand their decision, the film's views of London being destroyed by a bombing campaign were all too real to those of us who lived through the 70's,80's and 90's in London when the IRA were carrying out bombing attacks. But on the other hand, the narrative of the film is also true of London today. Cameras are everywhere, our Police force is being militarised and we are always told that 'terrorism' is to blame.....V is a hero not a villain, he is angry and frustrated at the way the World has gone, war, pestilence and death surround him and he finally fights back in the most spectacular fashion. If only it were true........"
"grabage01","10","2","5","5 April 2006"," UK reviewers have got it all wrong. Why?
","I can't imagine why UK film critics are so dead set against the British public seeing this film. It's heavily symbolic, and uses Brechtian distanciation to prevent identification with central characters in an effort to foreground the political and social concerns of the text. This is generally a fine strategy. In addition, It uses montage in an effective and polemical way, reminiscent of soviet propagandist film-making. Beyond this, it uses typage (a method of class representation) in order to discuss issues of British class conspicuously absent from almost all British cinema. It even takes, as its central inspiration, the story of Guy Fawkes (via Moore). Many historians suspect that the gunpowder plot was an anti-catholic propaganda conspiracy forged by Cecil, whose descendent's are still key figures of the British ruling class even as I write.<br/><br/>Overall, the film attempts to foreground its ideas over it's characterisation, a method only normally found in art film and (therefore) avant-garde film. As such, the fact that it is also entertaining is a triumph.<br/><br/>What is more, It signifies aspects of Britishness, (and American-ness) that we could all be proud of if we chose to be - our capacity for resistance.<br/><br/>So here lies my central confusion. How can you criticise a film for lack of characterisation or 'narrative' when it is self-consciously engaged in objective formal strategies and not subjective identification based ones? Is it because critics feel that people can't appreciate these types of film-making practice? You'd think that if they were right, no-one would like the film at all, and their views would be vindicated.<br/><br/>But people really seem to enjoy it. SHOCK HORROR.<br/><br/>Maybe there's another reason. Maybe all the film critics in the U.K. spend most of their time sucking long-pig meat from the soiled pants of the conservative socio-political ruling elite of Britain.<br/><br/>Oh, sorry, now I can understand the disparity between the formal/material evidence and mainstream opinion makers. They're all worried about their jobs. Twats."
"martinvmeer","8","2","5","4 April 2006"," Intelligent action movie
","Expecting an action movie like one of the 'The Matrix'-movies, I was surprised that 'V for Vendetta' was a different action movie. While the original comic handled political issues of that time, the movie handles some actual issues, although it never gives any answers. You can ask yourself the question whether V is a terrorist or a patriotic hero, and where lies the difference between these two? Also, the story contains some intelligent (minor and major) references. The begin of the movie (with Guy Fawkes) and the almost identical ending (with V unleashing a revolution) implies continuity. As like the makers of this movie would like to show that history proves that whenever things go terribly wrong, always a revolution has to happen.<br/><br/>Anyway, besides the political questions, the movie is great. With some intense action, witty dialogs and amazing special effects, the movie keeps pace. Although in the middle, it seems to slow down a bit. The story tends to be a little depressing and a little bit hard to believe sometimes, but it grabs you. The Wachowski Brothers succeeded in creating the right atmosphere.<br/><br/>Altogether I can say this movie deserves to be seen. The story contains several messages, put into a beautiful movie. We haven't seen that much these days in Hollywood."

I can only say; oh, my word. Somebody asked me yesterday what film I'd compare V for Vendetta to (in most cases not a big problem, you'd be surprised how few original ideas there are left these days). I thought briefly of A Clockwork Orange, and 1984, and discarded them. Not even close. I eventually had to admit that it IS original (to me, at least), and a damn good film to boot.

A grim future with a fascistic reign after a political battle to rid the country of sin and crime is not an unthinkable idea. The idea has been played out in books like 1984 (where John Hurt played the opposite role), and it has been done in the real world with Hitler. I guess we all fear such a regime. The actors played brilliantly, I was especially impressed with Natalie Portman. When she cries it really looks like she is crying. Nice to see that not all action movies are mindless and plot less, this was a very good surprise. Made me think about many issues, such as the use of evil to fight evil.

"noralee","8","2","5","3 April 2006"," Feast for the Eyes More Than the Mind
","Since the almost 60 years since George Orwell's vision of ""1984"" we were due for an updated re-imagining of fascism and ""V for Vendetta"" comes close.<br/><br/>While it borrows far too much old-fashioned Nazi and Big Brother iconography and methodology for a paranoid future where disease has crippled the first world and chaos has brought in an ostensibly fundamentalist Christian totalitarian regime over Britain, the flashy production and sound design and snazzy editing mostly keeps us from realizing this is less about political revolution and more about personal vengeance, as if it's an addition to Chan-wook Park's trilogy (""Oldboy"" etc.), which also borrowed heavily from ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" or like the anti-homophobe revengeful serial killer in the TV mini-series ""Epitafios (Epitaphs)"".<br/><br/>All of the power mongers, unfortunately, are seen more for their personal peccadilloes and homophobic theology, which makes them like hysterical updates from the Salem witch trials of ""The Crucible"". John Hurt as the big screen ""Chancellor"" seems too much like the Wizard of Oz thundering away with smoke and mirrors (and ironically contradicting his rebel role in a filmed version of ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"") and browbeating his underlings much like we saw Hitler in ""Downfall (Der Untergang)"", though they are lit more dramatically in the dark. Scarier would have been a more insidious contemporary fear-monger, like the cynically folksy Andy Griffith in ""A Face in the Crowd"". There is amusing satire of media manipulation and a Fox News type egomaniacal, rabble rousing TV commentator watching himself adoringly in mirrors. Sinead Cusack adds needed gravity as a haunted doctor. <br/><br/>The most intellectually captivating story angle, visually revealed through flashbacks that relieve talky explication, is a greedy ""Syriana""-like corporate conspiracy at the heart of the politics (or ""The Constant Gardener"" as it's pharmaceutical companies) that is investigated by a craggily persistent Stephen Rea as an old-fashioned cop (reminding me of the career police officer who found himself a Nazi interrogator in the docu-drama ""Sophie Scholl - The Final Days (Sophie Scholl - Die letzten Tage)"").<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving has the difficult task of doing virtually an audiobook version of the movie, as he is masked in all but one scene, but his voice is marvelous throughout, particularly in his introductory monologue of V words. Flashy editing of his actions helps give him more expressiveness, including ""The Matrix""-like effects emblematic of writer/producers the Wachowsks. It was very effective that ""V"" craftily brainwashes his minions into sacrificial fearlessness as much as the manipulative puppeteers of suicide bombers in ""Paradise Now"". His controversial climatic goal for inciting hope is actually a bit confusing in its intent and seems to confuse Kristallnacht with the bombing of the Reichstag as acts of rebellion, to continue the film's overt Nazi parallels. But ""V's own final battle brilliantly uses imagery from Ned Kelly's revolutionary stand that still spurs Australian nationalism. <br/><br/>His and Stephen Fry's parallel collection of rescued masterpieces from ""the vaults of the Ministry of Objectionable Material"" just seemed isolationistically nostalgic (complete with a constant symbolic background painting like a Renaissance Annunciation of a savior and a lot of Shakespeare quotes) and had little of the sense of comparative priorities we saw in John Frankenheimer's ""The Train "" which tensely weighed lives against the French art heritage. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman's English accent is annoyingly, ungeographically bland and inconsistent but her visuals are so dynamic, especially with her eyes, that I was only distracted in unemotional scenes. <br/><br/>Which is true of the whole film - that the visuals are so powerful they outweigh any thinking"

It certainly did not disappoint. Natalie Portman puts in yet another polished performance - and even Weaving is admirable, despite spending the entire film behind a Guy Fawkes mask. Without the face to convey emotion, his use of voice and body language is brilliant; and for this reason the film adaptation is an outstanding success.<br/><br/>Some have complained about choppy editing and glaring plot holes, but to focus on those is missing the point - V for Vendetta is an enthralling film from start to finish.

","This movie was incredible. It offered an interesting interpretation of a 1984 sort of scenario. The dialogue and monologue reminded me of a play rather than a movie, which I personally really liked. I was surprised and incredibly impressed by the job Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith of the Matrix) did making a stiff mask show character and emotion, especially after the dead pan sort of dialogue he has in other movies. There were times I could almost swear the mask's expression changed to reflect his mood (though I'm sure it didn't). There are several action scenes, but they do not dominate the movie. There is also enough comedy to keep the movie from seeming oppressive, while not seeming tacked in for that purpose. I think this movie would appeal to people with many different interests and favorite types of movie. It has something for everyone, wit, humor, politics, revolt, everything. A great movie, I would highly recommend it."

"neils888","10","2","5","1 April 2006"," This is not ""The Matrix""... But an absolute must watch
","This is not the type of film I expected from the Wachowski brothers, in light of the Matrix trilogy. The Matrix films involve successive layers of carefully crafted and choreographed action sequences filmed to perfection utilizing ground breaking filming technologies and techniques. The first of these film rarely pauses for breath as one action sequence runs to the next, hinting at the plot but always leaving the audience guessing the direction of the story's next development. If you are expecting this type of film going to see ""V for Vendetta"", then you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" is a plot laden political/human drama camouflaged as an action film. If you saw the trailer to the film, you would surmise as I did, the film would be an action laden affair. Surprisingly, this is not the case. Whilst there are dramatic and inspired action sequences, these do not drive the story.<br/><br/>The plot is post 911 cinema; Britain led by a manic arch conservative Chancellor (played brilliantly by John Hurt) has been driven into a Orwellian fascist police state through the manipulation of public fear against terror. Having gained power through fear of 'terror' and 'minorities', brutal suppression is used by a corrupt state to maintain its own strangle hold on its people.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving plays the elusive 'V'; a 'terrorist' seeking to expose the evil of the state to its people through large scale acts of mayhem whilst seeking revenge against those individual officials of the state that committed evil acts in establishing the corrupt government. As the plot develops, the true nature of the regime is exposed as its most evil individuals are killed and the evil acts that have created 'V' are revealed.<br/><br/>Evey (played brilliantly by Natalie Portman) is also a victim of the regime past, forced into silence through torture. Her life unwittingly becomes entangled with ""V"", when she witnesses first hand his first large scale 'act of terror' and is then entangled in his next. What follows is a brilliantly crafted, layered story that keeps you engaged between the relatively few action sequences.<br/><br/>This plot will resonate with people across the world. It warns of the dangers of power and the fragility of the democratic institutions that we can easily take for granted. It demonstrates the legacy of vengeance upon the individual, the power of ideals to fight extremism and the price of resistance for those with the will to fight. I thoroughly recommend this picture(this is by far the best film I have seen to date this year) and I thank those with the collective creative vision to bring this story to life. Must see."
"JosephLee411","Null","2","5","31 March 2006"," A Must-See, Regardless Of Your Political Beliefs
","The Joe Cool Review: V for Vendetta(2006)<br/><br/>Starring: Natalie Portman as Evey Hammond, Hugo Weaving as V, Stephen Rea as Finch and John Hurt as Adam Sutler<br/><br/>Plot: In a future where America is destroyed and England is the top power, it is run by a totalitarian government, with freedoms taken away and people of different religions, political beliefs and sexual preferences persecuted. A lone man codenamed V uses terrorist tactics to convince the people of England there needs to be a change.<br/><br/>Openers: I had heard many good things about this, but also some bad ones. I myself was torn because it was from the creators of the Matrix, but I thought it may be too political for my liking. I am happy to say that V for Vendetta eliminated my worries and was everything I was hoping it would be. It's an action film with messages about freedom and how corrupt governments are bad. Well that's basically the gist anyway. Some people say this movie defames our own US government and some say it glorifies terrorism. I disagree, but I'm not going to get into a political debate as this is a movie review.<br/><br/>The Good: The movie tells a very well-crafted story. It shows you how the futuristic government is corrupt, everything from controlling the media to banning controversial works of art, music and literature. Everything and everyone that the leader of the government doesn't like is either banned or black-bagged(arrested). If you don't like it, you're arrested. If you break curfew, you're arrested. In fact there are images here that remind me of the Third Reich(when Sutler is campaigning his troops outside of Parliament in flashback sequences) and the Holocaust. That just shows you what kind of government you are dealing with here. The two main characters and back story for why this all came to be is fleshed out and I couldn't see any real plot holes. Natalie Portman did well, as did the supporting cast, but my main focus is on Hugo Weaving, who plays V. You might remember him as Agent Smith. For someone that can't show facial emotions because of the fact he is always behind a mask, Weaving still manages to emote with body language and the tone of his voice. That takes some talent. He flowed through his scenes with ease and made you care for his character. Portman again did very well, although she did have some trouble keeping up the British accent. Also, the fight scenes are really well-done(considering who directed this it's no surprise) and there is plenty of bloodshed. And, I won't give it away but the final sequence is a sight to behold.<br/><br/>The Bad: This movie is not perfect, however. While the story is solid it does not flesh out some of the minor characters as well as I would have liked. The villains are just that, corrupt government officials. I at least would have liked more back story on Sutler. Also, this movie has a flaw in that regardless of whether or not you agree with it's political motivations, it does tend to get a bit preachy. It doesn't fail to hammer the message and by the time the movie reaches it's climax you're thinking, ""Okay, I get it. Corrupt governments are bad."" The movie can have a message, but it shouldn't try to force people to accept it. I would also have appreciated some sort of epilogue, but I can understand why it wasn't included.<br/><br/>The Ugly: A guy falls right on his head and neck in a spot that made me cringe. Also scar tissue from being burnt is never nice to look at. I won't say who but it was pretty nasty. Nothing else of note for this category.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: V for Vendetta was an enjoyable two hours and certainly a movie I'd pay to see again. Who would think an action movie could be so politically motivated and blend them both well? This one pulls it off. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Rating: ****1/2 of *****"
"wolfrankula","9","2","5","31 March 2006"," Alan Moore is a sourpuss
","What a great adaptation of one of the best comic series of all time! how sad that original author Alan Moore chose to have his name removed from the credits yet again. Director James McTiegue certainly didn't do the kind of hatchet job to Moore's work that was on display in such films as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and, some would argue, From Hell.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta on film is certainly just as thought-provoking and exciting as the graphic novel, perhaps even more so given the state of the times we now live in as opposed to the late eighties, when the books were originally published. With terrorism at the forefront of the public mentality and a government whose motives for war are constantly suspect the film seems even more timely than its source material. This bodes well for the forthcoming, oft- delayed film adaptation of Moore's brilliant superhero opus, The Watchmen, which when I last checked was once again seeking a production company after being dropped by Paramount & director Paul Greengrass. It seems that 300 director Zak Penn may be filling the shoes on that one.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor - if Moore's treatise on terrorism is all-new to you, head out to see V for Vendetta for a two-hour treat then find yourself a copy of the graphic novel for a day's worth of stimulating reading."

","What is remarkable about this movie is not that it had the courage to promulgate one political theory, it's that it had the courage to lay out so many simultaneously. Let's be honest here, folks, this movie is not anti-American in its core. It is an anti-fascist piece, and that is the most dominant political idea I found in this film. Even if you read the original graphic novel on which this is based, you will not find one anti-American reference there.<br/><br/>While I watched the film, you could almost tell when the brothers Wachowski sat around while writing the script and said to themselves ""Gee, there hasn't been an anti-American sentiment or statement in a while here, huh? OK, OK, what to do, what to do...I've got it, let's include the phrase ""The war that America started"" and pan to a news report about avian flu and hurricanes. Yeah, yeah, that's good, that's good, that'll bring the liberal masses into the theaters."" Sorry to break this to anyone, but this film makes the neo-conservative argument as much as it does the liberal one. That is why it is so brilliant. It does not present a single coherent political message, but rather weaves together disparate political and historical threads into a unique story which cannot be pegged by anyone. Anyone who is politically honest, that is.<br/><br/>My recommendation. Go see this movie with an open mind and no preconceived ideas. I'm sure you will find that the acting is simply superb (hats off to Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving for outstanding performances), the plot gripping and intricate, and the special effects simply jaw-dropping.<br/><br/>Makes me wait with great anticipation for what the Wachowskis will come up with next."

Don't watch it, it's that simple. If you cannot accept the fact that democracy is flawed and that it can lead to this and don't wish to hear about it then you have more problems than just not liking this movie. <br/><br/>Yes, there is a ripoff of the Nazi's but that's the point. The three biggest European powers in history are the French, German, and British. All but the British have had their tyrant, so this movie follows if the British did have one soon. <br/><br/>Overall I think this movie was a great way to expand your views on the world and realize, hey this stuff may happen in real life. Also this movie held a lot of hidden symbolism and philosophy. For those who like to read and like well constructed non-flawed plots with twists and turns this movie is excellent."
"h_schwitzke","8","2","5","30 March 2006"," a different way of storytelling
","although i am not at all sure, if i ""like"" the movie, if it did entertain me fully- if there weren't some really silly moments in it, i have to say i am surprised by the way it is told. the mixture of genres, the exaggeration, the artificial setting and characters on the one hand, the most serious conflict and motivation of the hero make it quite unique. Having seen various Hollywood movies one gets very used of and very bored with heroic, lofty showdowns and reduced-to-the-symbolic actions. But here i found myself inside a parable and it occurred to me while watching that i was feeling like a child being told a sinister fairytale by somebody i trust. and i mean feeling: there was a dark magic world revealing before me, dragging me inside but as well pushing me away by the stylization. the plot is extremely simple and as the point of it all is the moral responsibility every human being has and has to be serious with, the staging concentrates on the elaboration of that moral conflict, presuming rightly that the audience is ready to accept the ,well, ancient way of being addressed, leaving a lot of space for the own imagination (mask) The hints on actual policy only deepen my impression that the makers' intention is to show that good and evil never are connected with any ideal or ideology, but must be discovered and checked again and again within oneself. that, too i think is an both ancient and actual point. it is worth watching."

I can understand why someone would say it displayed the govt. in a bad way but what govt. doesn't hide things from there people? Christianity was not displayed in any way bad or good.<br/><br/>I thought the movie was a complete masterpiece I am sure it will be banned in england but I hope to see it win some awards in the states.

","I am writing this because i have just experienced something i have not felt in a long time. Immense satisfaction. Satisfaction gained from sitting in front of a screen and watching a movie that sucked me in and spat me out again at the end completely happy and in fact, panting for more. Hell, i enjoyed it so much i spent 10 mins writing this junk.<br/><br/>I went into this film knowing nothing about its plot, nor the Wachowski brothers' involvement. All i knew was Natalie Portman was in it, and i ain't her biggest fan but, hey its a movie i haven't seen so why not.<br/><br/>Firstly, you don't need to know anything about this to sit and watch it and enjoy it fully. I gather there is a graphic novel but not necessary reading.<br/><br/>Secondly I, unlike a multitude of others on IMDb loved the Matrix when it came out, and thought the sequels passable. I would not compare Matrix trilogy to V except during some of the action sequences as you would expect. Do not think V is an all action film - far from it, there is a lot of character development which does the film credit - you actually care what happens to the protagonists. <br/><br/>The actors involved are all a credit to themselves and make the movie what it is - Weaving is superb as the voice behind the mask and really steals every scene that he is in (which is most of em) and Portman actually impressed me because i didn't want to slap her at all during the film. <br/><br/>When the action does happen you will not be disappointed, beautiful flowing set pieces that please the eye. In closing, all i can say is that if at the end of this movie you are not standing up and thinking 'goddamnnit that was a bloody good movie' then you are a strange alien creature to me. <br/><br/>Blatantly buying it on its first day of release.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","I also went in thinking this movie was going to be rather bland and flat out stupid, for the mere fact of a man in a mask. It was so powerful and so I suppose inspirational. It was more than a man in a mask for I will not spoil the movie too much I hope. What starts out as a man in a mask, becomes a part of you. You can see the emotion behind the mask. The whole meaning of the movie and overall emotion is awesome.. I wish I could explain it better, but I'm at a loss of words. This movie was just truly amazing, I have seen it 2 times and will definitely buy the movie when available. This movie will be one that I will keep around forever."

","I thought this movie was fantastic - great acting and highly thought provoking. I was left unsure where the film stood politically although ultimately the film appears to be pro liberal democracy I did feel there were some right wing elements as well as some anti communist undertones. There seemed to be a myriad of political theory and paradox which was difficult to dismantle. Okay maybe i am being over analytical but surely this makes the film so much more interesting?! The film raised awareness of the power of fear yet also played on the audiences fears by including a number of real contemporary issues which prompt fear amongst the population, and I certainly left the cinema wondering if our society could really become the society depicted in the film."
"gigioiaderosa","9","2","5","28 March 2006"," No words to describe the magnificence of this movie!!
","Natalie Portman; Hugo Weaving; The Wachowski Bros., Owen Patterson. The crew is almost the same of Matrix, so there were two actual possibilities: a) this movie could be a special-effect whipped 'thing', of which I could get bored after 15 minutes; b) a masterpiece. Good Luck, we're in the second case!!! Now, I've seen a lot of movies about heroes, and beautiful and fragile girls, but this one . . . Hugo Weaving, 'V' for friends, made this incredible performance with the mask on for the whole film! Kinda makes you wander 'And what if he didn't use it? Would he have been nominated for the 2007 Academy Awards? 'V' is this almost-19th-century hero, actually living in the 21st century, and he's fighting against the system (against the London then-dictator; we're around 2030). He meets this girl,Evey, saving her from a potential multiple rape (transforming it into a multiple murder via stab wounds), and he also falls in love with her. On the other hand, Evey, which isn't pretty much interested in someone who kills people with the smile on the face (litterally), bit by bit gets rid of her fears and, at the very end, she falls in love for V-guy. All this stuff is merged with a certain dark-cyberpunk atmosphere, but less technological than 'Matrix', so that you can feel all the poetry of the main character . . . between a stab and a kick, of course!!<br/><br/>Why I gave it a 9/10: Visually speaking, it's astounding. The interpretation is actually perfect, and the characters seem really to be stitched on the actors; both the main guys, and the 'sidekicks'. The story is a mix of love, drama, thriller, everything merged in a dark atmosphere of a really doomed London. Advice: Vendetta, as a lot of people know, is an Italian word to say 'revenge'. Well, I'm Italian, and by seeing this film I've realized the ultimate meaning of the word 'Vendetta'. It could seem ridiculous for you, but, every great scene involving V doing something astounding, I used to say the word (in a low voice, of course!), 'Vendetta' . . . <br/><br/>Why I didn't give it a 10/10: Soundtrack. I don't want to sound or seem the Hermione Granger of cinema, but it's REALLY (sorry for the caps) way too similar to the 'Matrix' one . . ."

From the opening scene to the final credits this movie grips you. V is such a strong character whose honesty and genuine nature combined with his charismatic strength is fantastic against the dark background of the film. Natalie Portman is as amazing as ever and many of the plot twists will have you on the edge of your seat in excitement and anticipation. This movie will make you laugh, take you to the edge of tears and cause you to question the way in which the world is going - it will bring you hope and make you feel empowered.

I saw it on a philosophical level and my boyfriend saw it for the action adventure side.<br/><br/>Go and see this movie and make your own opinion. You can see this movie and talk about it for ages.

","V for Vendetta is exactly how films should be made these days. No special blood, guts, or gore just wonderful storytelling. Natalie Portman is a delight to watch as she gives a truthful portrayal of a woman influenced both ways, as many of us actually are especially where the war in Iraq is concerned. I loved how the characters were loosely compared to peoples in our own society such as Bush, Rush Limbaugh, and Fox News. I only hope this is just a movie however, and not an insight of things to come. It also has many memorable lines such as, ""ideas are bulletproof."" You walk away from this wanting to see it again and wanting everyone you know to see it with you. It will be talked about over and over again once more people get the chance to see it. V is not for villain but for vigilante. A new holocaust which takes place in the film quickly reminds us of WW2 and brings back all the feelings of sadness. How quickly people forget the past. This film may help them to remember...(the 5th of November?)Unlike the Matrix your do not have to see this twice or three times. Once will be enough. I have read other reviews where the plot is jumbled and lost this is Not true. i had No complications while watching this. Those going in not knowing what to expect will be changed. i know i was."

","Maybe the interpretation of this movie varies depending on your personal taste or whether or not you've read the original comic (I haven't), but I thought this movie was incredible. Not just incredible, but an amazing combination of action, suspense, adventure, and romance/drama. I walked into the theater expecting a movie, like recent flicks I've seen, that was far below what I had anticipated - instead, this movie took my breath away. Not one time during the film did I think it was long, tedious, or even remember I was in a room full of other people at all; this movie completely grabbed my attention and drew me into the corrupt, troubled world that was broadcasted on the screen. Honestly, I have never been so completely absorbed in a movie in my life - every event affected me as if I was there, experiencing what all the other characters were. I have raved about this movie ever since, and plan to go back many times before it is released on DVD! Definitely not a waste of your money - you'll be holding your breath the whole time - and loving every second of it!"

","This is by far the best movie i have ever seen. This includes Full Metal Jacket, the new LOTR movies, The Godfather, etc. I can really connect with V. As a Communist, the movie totally spoke my language. The setting is more or less where I see America in 50 years, and the whole movie was done with such finesse and style, i really think this will stand the test of time as a marvel of cinema. When Evey read Valerie's letters, i almost cried. The film is so moving, i absolutely love it. The movie wasn't too violent, it was violent when it needed to be, and it wasn't when it didn't. All the violence was gritty and realistic, and the movie didn't put in unnecessary bloodshed to make the lowest common denominator happy, like Hollywood usually does. I just saw this yesterday, and hope to see it again this weekend."

","Fantastic movie! The voice of Hugo Weaving and the play of Natalie Portman was fantastic. A scary but entirely believable background story and a tale of what one voice can do to a mass of people. The dark setting and the links to the dark sides of scaremongering in our times adds a chill more to the backbone of the movie.<br/><br/>One could have wished for a tad bit more to have been put in to the work with the environment and scenery, there was no feeling at all that it takes place in a future London.<br/><br/>The Wachowski brothers strike yet again with a plot that leaves the viewer with an entirely convincing feeling that it very well could happen!"

","V for Vendetta is a dramatic and fast paced futuristic thriller, set in a very bizarre future version of England!! Although there were some moments when I felt like cringing due to some obvious and avoidable clichés, I managed to laugh these moments off as I am not easily offended.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie was very finely wrought, and was never dull or boring once I had become involved in the movie's story and stopped viewing it objectively... There were enough plot changes to sustain interest, and to cover up loose ends.<br/><br/>The action scenes' impact were even greater for their rarity, a sort of ""music without silence"" comparison.<br/><br/>The movie built skillfully to an amazing climax, and had exactly the right kind of message that is relevant for today's society.<br/><br/>I have not read the graphic novel, and I suspect that despite popular opinion to the contrary, this movie was not written to add to the Graphic Novel in any way, but rather to steal its ideas that work on the big screen and drop those that don't, henceforth creating a film that anyone can enjoy. To be honest this film adaptation may seem less good to fans of the graphic novel, but I suspect that it is best for the majority of people the way it is.<br/><br/>This movie is written for today's generation, so I would recommend it to comparatively younger cinema goers, i.e. students, who may enjoy it more.<br/><br/>There is plenty in this movie for anyone willing to let themselves enjoy it and drop their pathetic prejudices and gripes."
"Velociraptor256","9","2","5","27 March 2006"," V For Very Good Viewing
","This was my first trip to the cinema in 2006, and it was either this or ""Pink Panther"" - having heard that PP wasn't too good, I chose V For Vendetta, and I'm very glad I did. <br/><br/>The film is a bit on the long side, but it'll keep you interested through almost all of it. Highlights for me include V introducing himself to Evey Hammond with his ""V monologue"", the comedy sketch on the TV show hosted by Stephen Fry's character, and the short lesbian storyline in the middle of the film (I was caught off guard by it as the films I've seen don't feature much homosexuality, but I thought this was done well - quite sad and moving). I also liked the music used in the film's dramatic moments.<br/><br/>I was interested in seeing Natalie Portman in something other than ""Star Wars"", and she put in a decent performance as Evey. When you see Hugo Weaving as V, you won't be thinking ""Elrond"" or ""Agent Smith"", partly because you never see his face, which is either hidden by darkness or a Guy Fawkes mask - he has to use his voice and body language, and he does it effectively. I was also looking forward to seeing Stephen Fry in a movie, having only ever seen him in ""Blackadder"" and as the host of ""QI"", and he too did well as Evey's friend Gordon.<br/><br/>V For Vendetta certainly isn't for everyone (like sensitive viewers, as there are some gory bits), but if you like action, drama and a film that makes you think (about such things as politics, terrorism and what the future might bring), you'll enjoy this film!"
"BruceB9","10","2","5","27 March 2006"," A very appropriate movie for the times.
","I was stunned at just how this movie related to the world today and what our government could easily become. The parallels were obvious, hatred of gays, hatred of Muslums, jingoism, isolationism, all the warning signs are there. Stephen Rea is a wonderful inspector who's only goal is to get to the truth. Hugo Weavings's performance is nothing short of brilliant given that he only has his voice to work with. Natalie Portman's performance is equally believable in her transition from the beginning to the end of the movie and her fear is palpable during her captivity. The Wachowski's have done another brilliant turn of paranoia and things not being what they seem and the look of the movie is perfect. Now if they just won't be tempted to make a sequel..."

","How close are we today? Gave me an eerie flashback to ""The Handmaiden's Tale"" from years ago. Remember, Remember. This has the same regard for the impending totalitarian state as do Handmaidens Tale, and 1984. Some very thinly veiled political allusions. As with other films of its genre, it should serve as a warning. Is art imitating life, or is life imitating art . . . who knows???? Thought provoking, awesome, disturbing, entertaining, enlightening, all at once. V strikes the same chord internally as did Zoro, years ago. Reminds us that the individual still needs to reign supreme. A government by the people and for the people needs to respond to the people."
"MKLayden","10","2","5","26 March 2006"," A remarkably faithful adaptation (down to the chosen imagery)
","Having read both the Graphic Novel and seen the movie, I would classify this as a remarkable distilling of Alan Moore's V FOR VENDETTA. The key scenes are there. The key characters are there. The key plot points are there. The key imagery is even more gripping, vivid, and eloquent than much of the original graphic novel. The dates have been changed. Some back-story has been modified. But the vision of one very disturbed man's revolution against tyranny itself is very much alive. The movie has as much or more of the dark sense of humour and poetic justice of the original GN, and the romantic elements are handled better. Though not perfect, the buzz about the movie is well-deserved; like it or lump it, V FOR VENDETTA will make you think."
"cobelee","10","2","5","26 March 2006"," V for Victory
","I am not one who condones the use of violence to make a statement. If anything, I believe that an idea is just as strong as a violent gesture and that if one is to overcome an oppressor, one simply has to stand up and say ""Hey! Bug off!"" Then again, I live in a neighborhood overrun with thugs and drugs. So I probably am the wrong person to ask on the subject.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta asked a lot of questions. I think that before one watches the movie, one should be ready or at least prepared mentally enough to 1) Understand what V is actually saying and 2) ask the questions themselves without linking them to obvious events and panning this film as nothing more than a political statement.<br/><br/>The movie centers around a government that COULD be our own in a very near future...not necessarily what IS our government now. I do believe on thing is true about the movie...When one loses all fear, one is truly free. Too bad, we're all pretty damn caged. V for Vendetta. V for a Mental Victory.

","This film is designed to walk the edge between what most people perceive as right and wrong, and as such, it will upset some, and gratify others. But like most artwork, I suspect most of the meaning you gain from the film actually comes from yourself and the way you want to see things. <br/><br/>Just as Guy Fawkes was seen by history as both a villain and a potential hero, this film embraces the duality of such human perceptions and offers them to the audience in equal slices. <br/><br/>For me the film was beautifully shot, and the characters richly portrayed. The action is finely tuned and merciless but spiced carefully throughout the story as flashbacks and history slowly reveal the characters and the culture. <br/><br/>Even though the film is very specific about the societies involved and how they got to where they are, I don't think the basic premise of the story is to pick on any one society, but rather to remind us that ideas are powerful things, and that when enough people have an idea, it can gain a life of its own, and become reality. <br/><br/>The story is laced with connections between characters and visual metaphors. It moves at a majestic pace and finishes with a crescendo. <br/><br/>For those who like their action movies thought provoking and their superheros flawed, I recommend this film highly. <br/><br/>Best Regards,"

","All the negative reviews of V for Vendetta say that it is anti-American. Actually, the problem with V for Vendetta is that it is not anti-American enough. America, out of willing stupidity and short-sighted greed, has replaced morality with prudishness, courage with pigheadedness, education with memorization, and prosperity with nine trillion dollars in debt  debt owed to the country formerly known as ""Red China"". And in return, the Chinese fill the shelves of Wal-Mart with sufficient junk to keep the sheep content with being shorn.

","Last night I saw the best movie to come out in a long time.V for Vendetta is a terrific movie with an amazing storyline and great performances.I was expecting something at least good, given that the movie's script was written by the Wachowsky brothers(who also produce it)and directed by their protegeé from the Matrix movies James McTeigue.It's been a long time since I got out of a movie theater feeling a better person just for watching a movie,(yes,I know it sounds lame)but it was honestly how I felt. V is a movie that appeals to one of most the strong and human feelings...the feeling of freedom. Some of the critics say that they don't understand what's the message,or messages from the movie,they complain that it's too confusing. In my opinion the message is very simple,it's a message of freedom,of revolution,what could be easier to understand than that?I'm not going to tap on politics or discus the parallelism between the movie and our current reality,or talk about terrorism.I'm going to judge the movie for what it is(unlike most of the critics who can't decide if their movie or political critics).V is the main character(portrayed by Hugo Weaving),a freedom fighter that opposes against a totalitarian and homophobic government.There are a lot of great performances in the movie,especially from Hugo Weaving,Natalie Portman and John Hurt. Natalie Portman gives another Oscar deserving role,after ""Closer"".She is just amazing and is well on her way to become the best and most accomplished actress of her generation.The dialogues are also very well written,especially the ones between V and Evey(Natalie Portman).The actions sequences are few,but very well filmed and very stylish. I don't want to give a lot of the movie away,go see it and take your own conclusions.V for Vendetta is a movie that is very well filmed,with great performances,innovative and that has a message.It's not afraid to make a stand and it mustn't be forgotten."

The War on Terror has been a smashing success and all of the terrorists including environmentalists, peace activists, librarians, Negroes, homosexuals, Jews, Muslims, affordable housing advocates and atheists have all been exterminated in concentration camps. What a peaceful, orderly society this must be! Though who cleans their homes and designs their clothes is one of the film's great mysteries -What? I'm just saying. Anyway, every paradise contains a serpent so along slithers a masked villain named V who kidnaps an innocent young woman named Evey and easily brainwashes her into becoming an England-hating traitor. V has his panties in a bunch because he thinks the well-spoken, charismatic Chancellor Sutler and his righteous administration are responsible for horrific crimes against the civilian population. Honestly, you'd think he could just knock back a Valium and watch HGTV like the rest of us. I'm thrilled to report that his plots are repeatedly foiled by the government, though I did miss the last 10 minutes because I was late picking up the dogs from the groomers. That's OK; we all know how the real story ends, don't we! Plus I jotted down the film's wonderful ideas for dealing with the public and the media.

I'd say it's ""1984"" for the 21st Century - a vision of a totalitarian government, and how one man struggled to make a difference.<br/><br/>This movie polarizes viewers. I'd guess you could even ""guess"" the political affiliations of people by asking them whether they liked this movie, or not.

","This film was good in the sense that all the basic elements of film came together into a cohesive and understandable plot. Delving into the structure however surfaces some flaws. The film shows that V came from an institute of some sort, but it does not go deep enough to make us really sympathize for the protagonist. Slight blemishes include such questions as how does Evey get so many changes of clothes when she is apparently in V's den the whole time? Spoiler Warning:<br/><br/>Who is helping V torture Evey? She does not see the ""shadowed"" figure but there seemed to be others. V states the his face ""has no eyes"" so how does he manage such fantastic attacks? The visuals in this movie are as expected incredible. The action sequences were quite spellbinding. Hugo Weavings acting behind the mask in quite good as is Natalie Portmans performance. Editing is quite good as well(consider the first sequence of Evey and V getting ready for a night around town so to speak). The symbolism is very good but a bit overused at times. There will be images in this movie that will stick in your head for a long time. Minor flaws but very well done. Worth the money to see on the big screen."

Evey was another perfect casting job, by Natily Proman. (Who proved to be the sexist woman alive in this one) This was just such an intricate plot. If you go to the bathroom, just don't come back, because you will be very confused. But what got my attention was the dialog. It was so intelligent!

","V for Vendetta is a comic book style allegorical thriller. Although the setting is England, the film is really about what is happening in present day America, and what the rest of the world will be like in twenty or so years given current political trends. America has already collapsed, and the UK is in the grip of a neo-con dictatorship that has risen to power by creating high level of fear and religious faith in the population, while at the same time pumping them with high tech propaganda. The dictatorial coup is initiated by the ruling elite executing a false flag attack on their own people. Vendetta is a remake of ""1984"" in the context of the Bush administration. It alludes to 911 and anthrax attacks, the Patriot Act, Abu-ghraib, the fearful and passive American public and its corrupt, greedy, and even evil government and much more. But you can also enjoy this film simply as a futuristic thriller, fast moving with excellent special effects and some violence. Neither the effects nor the violence is overdone. Direction, acting, and writing are also good. There are a lot of good literary quotations and memorable speeches. At one point V says, ""The artist lies to reveal the truth; the politician lies to conceal the truth."" The movie is worth seeing on a lot of different levels."
"germanelf","10","2","5","25 March 2006"," V for Vendetta
","V for Vemdetta deserves a 10. A story about a masked avenger at war with a totalitarian British regime, was drawn along the usual Orwellian lines but is clearly meant to have more than a passing resemblance to our current political environment. The story originated as a limited comic series in the early 1980's. Like the comic, the film is set in a near future, though now the time stamp is circa 2020.America, glimpsed only in passing on television, is paralyzed by civil unrest, and Britain has fallen to fascism. One night after curfew, a young woman Evey is saved from an assault by a man in a Guy Fawkes mask who introduces himself as V (Hugo Weaving, wasted under his costume). V slices and dices Evey's troubles away, topping off his handiwork first by reciting some vacuous verse and then by blowing up the Old Bailey. Thats just the beginning.This movie keeps you awake and waiting for the next explosion to happen. A lot of action and heart. And the end is just awesome... Put V for Vendetta on your MUST watch list."
"mrhockey123-1","6","2","5","25 March 2006"," Decent movie, really hated the political undertones
","This movie was good in the same sense as the matrix: lots of well-scripted action that was entertaining.<br/><br/>V's literary illusions were interesting although I have to admit that some of them probably went over my head (mostly because I haven't read some of the works he mentions.) The thing that I didn't appreciate about this movie was the political statement that it makes. At first, the movie is subtle at basically comparing the George W. Bush administration to Hitler, but it becomes more and more transparent to a point where it is sickening. There is a point in the movie where you can see a poster hanging on the wall that has a British and American flag with a swastika in the middle, and the words ""coalition of the willing"" written above. Further allusions to Nazi Germany include the leader of Britain being called ""Supreme Chancellor"" (which was Hitler's title.) In addition, human experiments are shown.<br/><br/>Moreover, the movie shows the re-election of the ""Supreme Chancellor"" to be based on a false war against terrorism.<br/><br/>I did not appreciate the fact this movie shows terrorism in a positive light. It seems to me that this movie endorses the ends justify the means IF your ends are good. However, good and evil are subjective judgments, and they turn morality into a moving object, which it is not. It seemed like there was some attempt made to show that V was not entirely correct in murdering people to attain the ends that he sought, but this fact is played down greatly, and overshadowed by the ""freedom fighter"" image.<br/><br/>At a time when the world is faced with growing terrorism, the last thing we need is a glorification of terror. That is primarily why I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I could have, if they didn't have such an obvious political slant."
"petticoatpirates","9","2","5","25 March 2006"," More than just entertaining
","Rarely can I say that a mainstream Hollywood movie has inspired me. I went into V thinking, ""Hey man, this looks great; I'll be entertained..."" and I was entertained but what struck me was the political relevance and approach of the movie. Sure you had your totalitarian government officials and ""Big Brother"" control of a seemingly ""protected"" and ""free"" society (MANY movies have dealt with this topic) but it was the picking of the scab to reveal the moist and tender truth of lies, deceit, power and eventual release of the populus' innate inner insurgent (try saying that fast five times!) to claim individual responsibility of their lives/communities/world that was so inspiring. One could not help but both fear and empathize with V (being the extraordinary ""Everyman"") and Evie's past torture via the government. There were many factors that made me fall in love immediately with the film but the one that cinched the deal was the masked masses of Londoners confronting the masked forces of the government and instead of bullets flying and yelling and blood and gore there was peace. The masses simply mixed and intermingled with those (voluntary puppets of the government) in silence. This made me just bust out man...my inner idealist cried at the simplistic beauty of the physical action in reuniting humankind in silence. Yes there was blowing up of government ran edifices too but that was not the point of the movie--the point was that we, as individuals and community, can free ourselves from socio-political brainwashing and can either choose to take the government's place of power and corruption or to unite and coexist as human beings. Wars and freedom can be won in unification and even in silence. Deep man, DEEP."

V for Vendetta just wants you to stop and think! That is all.<br/><br/>Ironically enough the film's stance towards the USA is belligerent and acidly condemning, but most US based critics have embraced the film's refreshing stimulation of the average movie goers brain!<br/><br/>However British critics say its not 'strong enough', and that it portrays england under a fascist regime as a land of people watching TV , going peacefully about their lives -a mediocre vision of the future that is pointless to analyse. They say it should have been set in America to make it more 'controversial' and hit home harder by tellin geveryone to be more anarchic...Its a film dealing with the idea of anarchy and extremism -not them itself!!!<br/><br/>And tell me where a man dressed as Guy Fawkes, and how the centuries of politics in the UK could have been translated to the USA ....without changing the characters, timelines and style completely...I hate to say it but give the film makers a break!<br/><br/>Lets not forget that the world in which main character V lives is a world where any minorities and dissidents have been removed- leaving only herds of 'average' middle class apathetic people who conform to all the rules and believe all they read and see in the press...more or less most of us today....<br/><br/>And if you see the film :- remember you don't need to know 'everything' about the characters -because the film wants you to decide if they are good/bad/crazy/sane, form their attitudes , action and ideas -NOT from who they were, which side they fight for or where they came from!

","I really enjoyed this film, although I always question Natalie Portman's acting, but she was great in this film. I was amazed at how close it stayed to the comic (of course there were a few ""what the's""). I definitely would recommend this film to others, especially if you like psychological films. I enjoyed Hugo Weaving's performance and the fact that you don't see his face ever in the film adds to the character and made me route for V. I think Alan Moore and David Lloyd created a wonderful comic series, which puts the world into perspective and questions how leadership can end up going wrong. I like the Hitler-type leadership that was created. There is so much to say about the comic series and movie. My favorite parts of the film where all the stunts and movement V has; they are a little Matrix-style but with a Gothic hint to them. I give the stunt coordinators major kudos."

I've read comments talking of how the novel was adapted to the big screen. The novel gives the film an idea to go on, but just because your adapting from a novel does not mean you have to stick to the novel completely.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta has action, it has parts of a romance, a totalitarian government and so it was inevitable that this film would be political. There's no doubt about it, this movie is political but not in the boring sense. You have a government who has allowed it's people to trade it's freedom for the guarantee of safety, safety from violence and all the harms of todays society. In comes V. The man intent on changing this regime and giving back freedom to society. And this is where the movies starts. I'm not going to give away what happens in the movie other than this is a brilliant piece of cinematography and I really bought into this movie and it really made me feel like I should act more politically. There is a part in the movie towards then end involving many a people when I actually had a lump in my throat and nearly shed a tear at the sheer human power and if you see this film you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>So in short....GO SEE THIS FILM!!!!!!"

We never see who is behind the mask - allowing the filmmakers to switch the lead actor midway through the film. Natalie Portman reprises her role as America's Favourite Star Wars Character and, while in prison, discovers the most convoluted and ""tortured"" gratuitous lesbian subplot ever invented in cinematic history.

","Really interesting and intelligent film. Politically, I thought it was fairly disturbing as it seemed to promote a sort of anarchy that I don't know if I agree with (V's symbol itself is only one stroke away from the symbol for anarchy), but it's definitely a lot of food for thought. It manages to be moving without being sentimental, and brings up interesting topics without being judgmental. Hugo Weaving turns in a fantastic performance just with his voice and body language, and Natalie Portmann is appropriately fragile and strong. And certainly, it was unavoidable to feel moved and roused by the ending, that promises better things but doesn't necessarily guarantee it. Overall, I found this to be a smart, non-preachy film that's highly entertaining and moving at the same time as highlighting those questions that should asked."

","What I found most interesting (and alarming) about this movie is its believability. The England of the film is not terrifying merely for the fear and disgust its rulers evoke, but for how near it is to our own times. There are no flying cars or laser guns or any of the other trappings of dystopian, science-fiction movies with omnipotent rulers. Everything as shown in the movie could be put in place tomorrow, and in some parts of the world, it is already a part of everyday life. Go see this movie for its splendidly filmed, awe-inspiring visuals and to placate the understandable itch to see what all the fuss is about, but mostly see it to question and probe. This movie was meant to be political, and it surely is. Some will lambast it for its apparent ""glorification of terrorism,"" but as an avowed conservative, just what would any freedom loving individual do in the characters' circumstances? Convene a protest? Sign a petition? Agree or disagree with my admittedly humble opinion, see it to strike up a discussion, one that is sadly becoming less and less frequent nowadays."

It was done in a way that was exciting and kept my attention. Natalie Portman did an outstanding job. The special effects were great. Lot of explosions for those people that need things to blow up in an action movie.

I am sure many will view this film as a terrorist fantasy, but what I see is the U.S. Second amendment (""right to bear arms"") at it is best. Not only is it '06's number one, but the best comic turn movie I have ever seen (that's bold when Spiderman was so successful). Comics never seem to fulfill it's hype on the silver screen, but V for Vendetta was a hit. This storyline is a possible scenario for the future, and that's makes the film so believable."
"Bomzaway","9","2","5","22 March 2006"," The role of coincidence
","***Somehwat Mild Spoilers*** After a second viewing of V4V, I noticed that the role of coincidence play a prevalent part throughout the film, and does so in many different ways. The opening scene itself shows Evey and V preparing for an evening at the very same time, while the ""Voice of London"" rants away in the background. But this is just the beginning. There are more obvious coincidences such as her name ""EV"", as well as the very fortunate coincidence of Evey being a gopher at the BTN. Also among the more obvious are the coincidences in the two mornings when Evey awakes at V's place, and when she awakes at Steven Fry's place (the egg, the music, even the similarities in some of their mannerisms).<br/><br/>However, if you look closely, I believe there are other smaller coincidences as well. I think many of the various characters are drinking Johnny Walker Red. If I'm not mistaken, I think three different scenes open up with the pouring of that particular brand of scotch; Evey and Steven Fry's first evening together after she escapes V, Prothero's shower scene, Inspector Finch pondering the horrors of the past. Then there's the fact that John Hurt's character, a Big Brother-ish dictator just happened to play the Winston Smith character in the film 1984, the logo for which also happens to sport a large V.<br/><br/>Granted, none of these are really coincidences, they are merely planned events portraying coincidences. One might discount these coincidences as being contrived illusions; mere plot vehicles vivified for the sake of our entertainment. ""Aren't these just realities hidden behind a mask?"" you ask? But if you still question the validity of my vision, then I hope to vindicate my verdict by ask you to recall V's voraciously verbose opening monologue.<br/><br/>""I'm merely remarking upon the paradox of asking a masked man who he is."""

"s_cadzow","9","2","5","21 March 2006"," Absolutely Outstanding!
","James McTeigue's V for Vendetta is the film adaptation of Alan Moore's darkly riveting graphic novel. While falling in season with the plethora of book to film adaptations, V also brings some heavy and controversial topics with it, making it a breeding ground for critics at every angle.<br/><br/>The storyline for V is thick and a lot more intelligent than most action movies to date, especially those in the comic to film genre. While this seems to be working for and against the film in some cases, V for Vendetta is an extremely fun thrill ride with a very sophisticated level of intelligence and politics to keep things on edge.<br/><br/>In V for Vendetta we follow the charismatic and cultural masked avenger who goes only by the name ""V."" Dressed in complete black, and donning a Guy Fawkes mask, we are told little of V's past, except that at the rise of the totalitarian government in Great Britain, he was part of a monstrous government controlled virus experiment. As the governments power grows more and more out of hand, our shadowy hero rises to take a stand for himself and the people of Britain, he sets out to make sure those responsible are held accountable for their actions.<br/><br/>Our first outing with V shows him coming to the rescue of a young lady named Evey, as she is in danger of being raped by Britain's secret police. From that point on, their fates become intertwined, now that the government officials suspect Evey of being in league with the now considered terrorist V. As V launches his rally for the people of Britain, Evey is caught in between hiding from the government and whether or not answer V's call.<br/><br/>With V's trials bringing out the more powerful inner Evey, and the people of Great Britain becoming more and more weary of their leaders, we follow a pair of detectives as they try and bring V down. However, as they uncover more and more about the truth, they find that maybe it isn't V that they should be going after.<br/><br/>The mood of V for Vendetta comes across beautifully. Evey street corner is dark, cold. A perfect reflection of how we are lead to believe V feels inside. The score is astoundingly accurate for the picture that V paints, leaving you simply enthralled with its intensity. As for a protagonist who wears a mask for the films entirety, Hugo Weaving couldn't haven been more convincing. With every tilt and nod of his head, we know what he's thinking, feeling, the vengeance and the love.<br/><br/>What I liked most about V for Vendetta is that from start to finish it never backs down once. Whether it is the ever-stylish Wachowski influenced cinematography, or the bold call to action set forth by V, this film remains solid in all convictions. With all the ways that the script for V could have turned out to be, the trivial delicacies were handled well by McTeigue, such as never revealing our heroes face to the audience.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a film that is very much heightened with being seen on the big screen, and a film that I feel very much deserves to be seen as such. V is a tactful culmination of art, style, wit, freedom, politics, love, liberation, and exceptional film-making. While it is obvious how the political plot can be a turn off for some, there is so much more to be taken from V than whatever American political parallels critics are trying to imprison the film with. I cannot say enough how much I enjoyed this film."

","The same elements that drew audiences into the Matrix are present in this thoughtful motion picture: a sound but inquisitive premise; interesting characters; and a pleasing cinematic presentation that keeps you involved. The Brothers W. managed to tell a complicated tale that could be taken as the back story from today's headlines with relative ease.In large part they manage this feat through the efforts of two fine actors, the diminutive but intense Natalie Portman and the long limbed and velvety voiced Hugo Weaving. Together they counter the action scenes of slo-mo blades slicing through the air with acid trip trails with real drama delivered with few wasted words and much emotion. And Hugo does the whole thing wearing a mask! Not a film for the action freak per-se, but they do manage to blow up a world class monument. It is a dark glass of red wine of strawberry and currant flavors that is to be savored.<br/><br/>Supporting the fine leads are Stephen Rea as a police detective who does the right thing, Stephan Fry who exudes his intelligence and a Hitler looking John Hurt. Both Rea and Hurt are older and they use their craggy looks to their character's advantage.<br/><br/>It wasn't what I was expecting at all and I was very happy for that. I was sorely disappointed with the Matrix 2/3 I expected more gun than word play in this adventure. This film is clever and it brings hope to the masses, both on the screen and I expect in the lobby."

","In the post Lord of the Rings theatrescape, I honestly felt there wasn't much more the movies could do for me. Everything had been done, and done well. Where can you go after the Battle for Gondor? <br/><br/>Thankfully, V for Vendetta has reminded me that I can still be dazzled. And how.<br/><br/>First, the political message of this movie is so gritty, subversive, and radical, it makes me weep with joy to even be able to see it in a theatre. The vast majority of people will of course recoil in horror at the protagonist's methods, but those who put aside the usual knee-jerk aversion to property damage will appreciate the uncompromising commitment to freedom.<br/><br/>It can't be a coincidence that the co-production company of the movie is ""Anarchos"" (Greek for anarchy). One doesn't usually imagine a world without rulers, but after seeing William Hurt playing a dictator named ""Sutler"", you have to think that direct action against a government isn't so much a terrorist act as a civic responsibility. It's an important message, and I love that this movie went there. <br/><br/>Second, the cinematography is superb. Excellent mood, great camera work.<br/><br/>Third, Hugo Weaving does an amazing job acting through a mask. I hated the Guy Fawkes visage at the beginning, but with only a few lines of dialogue, Weaving makes him a likable character, and I still don't know how he does it. Natalie Portman simply blows me away. It is yet another indictment of George Lucas that this actress shines so brightly when she isn't forced to regurgitate wooden lines to a wooden man.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good about this movie.

I didn't know whether to expect a mindless action film or a riveting cinematic adventure. I walked out the theater with a different thought indeed. This is one of the most unique comic book movies you would probably ever find. Don't expect a Matrix feel of this movie just because it was written by the Wachowski brothers.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying this movie had a plot oh man did it have a plot. Set in the somewhat distant future in London this movie touched on interesting events. In an opposite turn where Germany won WWII this makes you think. The acting was absolutely astounding. Hugo Weaving who portrays V did a superb job. Acting behind a mask seems like tough work though he pulled it off through his voice and words and his body movements.<br/><br/>His mask has so many different meanings and even though it stays in one position the way Hugo pulls it of makes you beileve what is going on. His character was the most unique some what super hero you will ever see. Cross Batman with Shakespere and Leonardo Da Vinci and you have V. He may have a fondness for art and poetry but give him some knives and this guy can do some serious damage. On the other hand Natalie Portman who played Evey did an excellent job. He performance instantly made you fall in love with her character and you where locked in.<br/><br/>The supporting roles where also well done. The over all film had very gripping performances. The action sequences where completely awesome. Taking a unique fighting style and throw in a few speacil effects here and there and a little well sort of a lot of blood and you got some very cool and enjoyable sequences. The movie ends with a message that I hope viewers will think about and hopefully change their outlook on the world.<br/><br/>This movie makes it to my top 5 of 2006 which is still a small list.

"PsyFoob-1","9","2","5","20 March 2006"," A Must See Film About Politics And Vengeance
","V For Vendetta is not your typical action flick. In fact, it is barely an action flick at all. This movie is really a political thriller that contains action, romance, mystery, and even a little horror. V (played brilliantly by Hugo Weaving) is a very complex character who is more than just a man seeking revenge. He has motives, but are they entirely just? This a question that Evey (played with such emotional force by Natalie Portman) must ask herself when she is caught up in the web of political intrigue that V has started. The police think that Evey must work with V after cameras catch the two together (he was really just saving her from Fingermen, enforcing their own brand of law), and so a detective (Stephen Rea, doing a sensational job) tries to track them both down after V promises to blow up Parliment in exactly one year on Guy Fawkes Day. I don't want to ruin any of the secrets or surprises that await, so I will just say that you should give this film a chance if you were previously on the fence about it.

If terrorism is to rise up violently against one's own repressive government, then history has seen many a terrorist, some of whom can be seen daily on many a nation's currency.<br/><br/>The casting of John Hurt as the chancellor is terrific!

","V for Vendetta is the epitome of cinema. It is never dull, and it leaves you on the edge of your seat (to coin, forgive me, the hackneyed phrase). Eloquent and philosophical, it has many morals and a huge overall meaning about government and human nature, and it is fast-paced and fantastic, though not so fast-paced as to turn it into an action movie. <br/><br/>It is remarkable. Upon viewing the film, one might classify some instances as being odd or irrelevant. Nevertheless, when one looks back at the movie as a whole, he or she can clearly see the relevance of each individual part of the movie. It is that good. <br/><br/>Although Evey's VERY LAST LINE leaves a milligram of irritation in one's mind, the entire movie is full of fantastic lines, incredible scenes and unbelievable emotion and feeling that will leave an aftershock unlike the effect from any other movie.<br/><br/>It is wonderfully phenomenal, and should NOT be missed by anyone."

","A lot of the bad criticism of this movie is based along the lines of ""it refuses to define itself"" or ""is it an actioner or is it a social commentary or what"". I personally don't believe that these are valid criticisms. I had absolutely no issue whatsoever with the fact that this film assaults many themes at once. The action was great. The acting was very competent. The music was excellent. Some people point out plot holes, but at the end of the day we shouldn't really care.<br/><br/>This is the sort of film you can take any way you want - an actioner, a love story, a political message. Basically it has followed the recent trend of fusion in art amongst many other things, and I think in this case that it works well.<br/><br/>It does get a little confusing in places but if you pay enough attention then you should be able to get the general concept of what's happening. I heard Jonathan Ross really didn't care much for this movie - tough luck Wossie!"

I should save ranting for the boards). Being a fanboy, I am sad to have missed the original Alan Moore comic (its what they are - deal with it). I think it was something to do with the grinning Guy Fawkes reminding me too much of the whole batman/joker thing... wasn't too fond of Batman at the time... thought it was a rip off... but that's my problem. <br/><br/>I've heard bits of the story have been tinkered with, but this film deals with some seriously heavy themes and any off the cuff comparrisons to the Man in the Iron Mask, Phantom of the Opera, Spartacus etc do it a discredit. It acknowledges it's sources and pays homage by giving them a somber twist, the end result is a tale of holocaust that can't be highjacked by comparisons to WWII. <br/><br/>The London setting is still refreshingly odd and the look and feel has a convincing air, with just the right tint of something is well wrong here. It reminds me of Brazil - for perhaps obvious reasons - and I would urge people to see both of these films as they give a vision of what any controlling system is capable of if allowed to go to extremes and I hope will encourage people to have a stake in society, rather than turn a blind eye or throw their toys out of the pram when things go wrong. <br/><br/>To much for a movie? I think not. As is a theme of in this film, it is a function of art to point at truths with fiction, Or something like that.<br/><br/>Looks great - Weaving, Rea and Fry are brilliantly cast and give fine turns accordingly, though Mr Hurt is under used and the character is somewhat hamfistedly done - but the mood and script make for a compelling and haunting movie that could have been soooo bad. How they got lines like ""I had three years of roses"" to work has got to be some sort of miracle. Fine fine stuff. See it."

","What a moment it is for me to go into a superhero movie and find a fine film. The Characters of V for Vendetta are brought to life in their full comic audacity by Portman and Weaving. The story unfolds in Fascist England which is under the rule of a religious zealot in the style of Nazi Hitler. As the story line progresses the incredible liberal agenda of the Wachowski brothers shines through making this film hard to swallow for those conservative members of the audience (One man sitting behind me in the theater said, ""What is this, Brokeback Vendetta?""). Overall, the bloodshed and Violence are brief and make this an okay film for the teenager who's parents are willing to watch, and the film's formal elements are absolutely fantastic. If this weren't based on a character I would criticize some of the obsessive use of theatrical rhetoric from the V character, but Hugo pulled it off, and this film is a must see for those of us who accidentally watched 'Electra' hoping for 'X-Men' or 'Batman'."

","V for Vendetta is, in my humble opinion, the best comic-based movie to come out in the past year or so. The casting crew did an excellent job in finding actors that would stay true and capture the essence of the characters they portrayed. The tone of the production was even with the mood of the graphic novel, and the ""gritty sterile-ness"" of the country the movie is set in is beautifully portrayed.<br/><br/>I did not see any cheesy lines, or any of the hokey disasters that plagued movies such as ""Batman Forever"", so that was a big plus for me. I loved the voice play by Hugo Weaving. Once again, the combination of the Brothers Wachowski visionary genius and Weaving's incredible ability to use his voice to evoke any emotion he wishes (Agent Smith in The Matrix Trilogy) proves to push another great movie to the Big Screen. In fact, the only thing i found wrong with this movie is that it was over too soon. A definite multiple-view movie this is."

Hugo was excellent at using his subtle movements and voice to portray that V fully. I was pleased that it wasn't as dark as some other comic book films are. <br/><br/>The characters are well presented including the rest of the cast. Made you think a little and visually appeased me.

","As are a lot of people I am a big fan of the book of V for Vendetta. When I heard that a film was going to be made I was a little bit worried - a classic comic book made into a film? So many times this has happened in the past and so many times disappointment has followed. So, when the film finally arrived, it was with some trepidation I paid my money and took my seat....<br/><br/>As usual, the film makers decide to leave things out and put some of their own stuff in. But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. My wife hadn't read the book and was able to enjoy the film as a ""standalone"" piece, whereas I had read the original episodes published in Warrior and in the subsequent DC/Vertigo effort where I was able to complete my reading. My wife loved the film, and I must say, so did I. Although the film makers saw fit to do their thing and fiddle about, they did retain the spirit and the intent of the book. The acting is to a high standard and I'm certain that Hugo Weaving paid a lot of attention to the books and in my mind became ""V"".<br/><br/>As I say - film and comic, two sides of the same coin. The film, whilst not a perfect copy of the book, it does endeavour to remain faithful to the ideal and in the end, ends up in the same place. Sometimes, arriving is as important as th journey."
"rojoesmuerto","10","2","5","19 March 2006"," The single most important film of our times
","I have just seen the most important film of our times. V for Vendetta stands proudly and appropriately among such scathing and satirical works as Fahrenheit 451, Network, and 1984. Stylistically, it speaks directly to our generation, and its message is clear: The world is yours if you'd only stand up and claim it! From beginning to end this movie is utterly captivating. It is unflinchingly gripping and compelling in all regards. Natalie Portman, despite her unconvincing accent, turns in a fantastic and moving performance that cements her as one of the most important stars of our day. And while Hugo Weaving may not have been seen, he brings a vibrant and stoic honor to his role that I doubt could have been replicated by many others. The entire cast, in fact, is remarkably moving and all help to create a world that is both astoundingly unreal and eerily familiar. This film is made great by its acting alone, and made magnificent by everything else.<br/><br/>The Wachowski brothers have finally emerged from the fog of their own Matrix, and all hail their return! The script for this film is nearly flawless, the cinematography is spell binding, and the overall style sets it firmly as the masterwork of our times. In all ways it is appealing for modern viewers. It does not grow stale, but remains constantly churning through captivating dialogue, amazing action, and a truly compelling story. And like many great satires, it takes our world (our certain future and our murky past) and, rubbing our faces in it, demands that we answer the question, ""If our own government was responsible for the death of a hundred thousand people, would you really want to know?"" Those who do not appreciate this film (and they will be many) are not meant to stand amongst the vanguard of the new millennium. The stagnant and obstinate right will be predictably defensive, they will react reflexively and thoughtless against it. Indeed, I feel they will see their own world reflected back at them through the fun-house mirror of this film and be repulsed by its ugliness.<br/><br/>Perhaps unseen, but equally expected will be the jeers of the radical left. While this film may well have been tailor made to fit their ideals they will not embrace it and, in fact, certainly blast it simply because it's a major studio release. They would have us believe that a film purified of funding, that is seen by no one, is preferable to one that's been tainted by financial backing. Unfortunately, as the right is not meant to keep an old world, these people are not meant to mother a new one.<br/><br/>But for those of us who can embrace this film, its message and meaning must not slip away. As so many have done before, this is a work that calls us to action. Sitting idly in the theatre, only to walk calmly to your car, drive home, and go to bed does a disservice to the spirit of this film. It is not meant for the disimpassioned or the apathetic. It was made for the vanguard. If you are amongst that rank, it is your duty to see it. If not, you should probably see it anyway."
"josh-694","8","2","5","19 March 2006"," ""V for Vendetta"" is a blast to watch
","The verdict is in for ""V for Vendetta"", the vengeful and vastly versed V is very verbose and vivacious and will not be vacated from my mind. V played by William Rookwood is superbly articulate man who wants revenge on everyone that made him the way he is today. He wears a mask throughout the whole film, and although you never see his face it won't stop you from feeling every emotion he feels. He refers to ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" repeatedly which gives a lot of incite to what he is feeling and how obsessed and driven by vengeance he is. Evey, Natalie Portman, is a woman that gets thrown into his world and tries to figure out is she can/should help him and his crusade against the new dictatorship that runs England.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in the not so distant future and portrays a London run by a totalitarian government full of corruption and secrets. V tries to create a revolution by reminding people that, ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."" He does this by reenacting the events of November 5th, 1605 when Guy Fawks tried to blow up the English Parliament; though he failed his name became synonymous with freedom. V is determined not to fail and tells the people of London to meet him at the Parliament in a year's time to overthrow the government on November 5th, 2020.<br/><br/>The movie has a few flaws, which is usual for comic book adaptations, but doesn't detract one bit to the movie's message or entertainment value. The style is similar to the Matrix and should be with the Assistant Director of the Matrix series, James McTeigue, directing the movie and the Wachowski brothers who wrote both the Matrix and V for Vendetta. Though the style is similar, V is not at all similar to Neo or any other character in the Matrix; V has qualities that are more similar to Eric Draven in ""The Crow."" He lurks in the shadows, hides his identity and kills anyone that tries to stop him.<br/><br/>There wasn't as much action as I had hoped but the action that was there was awesome. The ending contains a short fight scene that is truly amazing and shows V's determination and wrath. For the most part the movie is pretty well balanced with action, drama, suspense and science fiction. ""V for Vendetta"" is a blast to watch and will leave you thinking about the freedoms we have, and the freedoms we let go."

","I went in to V for vendetta expecting quite a bit. I heard it was an exceptional and enjoyable movie and that it had a positive message. I left the theater with mixed feelings. While parts of the movie were certainly entertaining, as a whole I felt the movie was very heavy handed. Make no mistake about it, while V for Vendetta takes place in the future, it is very much a condemnation of our present. It attacks religion and modern politics with even more vigor than the main character attacks a fascist British regime.<br/><br/>In addition, there was not a great deal of action in this film. The trailers left me with the impression that this movie was non-stop action, when this is not the case. There is at least one really solid action scene, with a satisfying ending, but aside from that the action was lacking.<br/><br/>Lastly, the special effects are garish and unsightly at best and at worst downright laughable. There are a few scene in particular where I grimaced as what would otherwise be a gorgeous scene was transformed into something hideous.<br/><br/>I would recommend V for Vendetta, but only just barely. It was an entertaining film and a good way to spend two hours."

What a great great movie. This truly is an important movie. A shadowy freedom fighter known only as ""V"" uses terrorist tactics to fight against his totalitarian society. Upon rescuing a girl from the secret police, he also finds his best chance at having an ally. That's all I'm going to go into for plot details.<br/><br/>I've never read any of the graphic novels this is based on, so this is a review after a virgin viewing. I love this movie, plain and simple. Hugo Weaving is V and he plays the part amazingly well. Even though V's face is never shown, it doesn't need to be. Weaving uses mannerisms and has such a great voice, that sometimes you forget that it's even a mask. Natalie Portman is wonderful as well as Evey. Both of them have such a great chemistry together and it's always great when they're on screen. The rest of the cast is wonderful as well (John Hurt is amazing as well even though he's not in it all that much).<br/><br/>This is not an action movie like the trailers portray it to be (nor is it directed by the Wachowski Brothers as some are lead to believe). It doesn't need to be though. The story, characters and events are so good, that the few action moments in the film (which are spectacular by the way) are so good, you don't need action. It's such an interesting plot too, which I won't get into because you should see it yourself. The action scenes in this are great though, especially at the very end, I got goose bumps. The end sure goes out with a bang too, it's a great great ending to a great great movie.<br/><br/>I seriously recommend this movie. It's a very smart movie that puts story over action and characters over flashiness. This truly is an important movie that makes you think, it wants you to think and it does so wonderfully. I recommend this movie completely. It's a great first movie by James McTeigue, it's controlled very well and is a tight movie.<br/><br/>""Beneath this mask there is more than flesh.

","I really enjoyed this movie. I had my doubts based off of Hollywood's previous adaptations of Moore's work.<br/><br/>However, there are a few things that I missed. It was a shame to see that Hollywood butchered the script a bit in order to portray V and Evey in a more positive light. Evey was not arrested for being out past curfew, she was a prostitute. Puzzling is how they didn't alter the torture sequence (which showed how far V is willing to go), yet they cut out the entire Rose subplot. (In the graphic novel, an officer is killed when they find the coroner. His wife plays a minor but important part later on in the story. V's dialogue later indicates that he expected this to happen.) <br/><br/>Minor things, but they kind of hurt my enjoyment of the movie. I wish that they had included Fate, especially since that would explain how V got in everywhere, but c'est la vie."

The combination of Portman's mere screen presence, Hugo Weaving's voice, and an action packed Wachowski Bros. screenplay provided for a fantastic movie-going experience. Going in, I wasn't really sure what the movie was to be about. I think I had read somewhere that there were those who thought it glorified terrorism. But it wasn't about terrorism at all. It was about revolution. Its amazing how the ""T"" word is tossed about so freely these days. The movie is filled with political statements, asking us to question some conservative ideals and mostly to question our government. John Hurt does such an over-the-top rendition of the Hitleresque chancellor that at times I thought his head was going to explode. I did have to suspend my disbelief on many occasions. But hey, it's a comic book movie about a mythical hero in a fictional future. Portman and Weaving are at their best. I especially liked the fact that I actually cared about the characters, an achievement that I always find amazing to accomplish in a 2 hour movie. This was the best Wachowski flick since the original Matrix. And while I realize that they didn't direct this movie, its obvious that their hands are all over this one.<br/><br/>Definitely recommended."
"amentoraz","8","2","5","18 March 2006"," The west only survives...
","As a hardcore fan of the comic book, I was afraid when I went to watch the movie ... but I had at the same time some hope on the sort of insight that made The Matrix -not its sequels- the huge thing it was.<br/><br/>With a series of minor absurd changes to the book (V in love with Evey? Please...) and things that should not have left behind in the book (anarchy, the message in front of TV, LSD), I think the movie is very well executed, and that it brings a message which is becoming essential, lest we end up finally losing the fight for reality.<br/><br/>When I say ""the fight for reality"" I do not necessarily mean a strictly anarchist point of view, or whatever. I mean the simulation we play which they tried to point out on Matrix, the depths through which consumerist culture has thrown us into a new Dark Age in which behaviors, likes and dislikes and anything we believe is our ""will"" is expertly conditioned by an omnipresent media which models such will.<br/><br/>While as Matrix was a statement on the nature of the Simulation, even pointing towards philosopher Jean Baudrillard inside the movie, the way in which the Wachowsky brothers have depicted V for Vendetta is the very structure of the Simulation. The message is very simple, wake up, think for yourself, we have delegated too much time our will on these powers that are now extending their means to control it. Democracy, though it is an advancement, is still a method of government in which the economic blocks fight among themselves for power through political puppets of every sign, and a method of government in which certain rules -such as the need for workers to sell themselves to those in control of the economy- cannot be changed.<br/><br/>In other words, as the laibachian sentence said: ""The West only survives because it slyly established a system which insists on people's freedom. That is to say, under democracy, people believe they are acting according to their own wills and desires.""<br/><br/>This is an important movie. Go watch it."

","Can you win an Oscar for a role in which your face is never seen? I think you can after seeing Hugo Weaving as ""V"". Playing a role where he is covered head to toe and wears an unchanging mask Hugo still gives the best performance of all in a movie filled with good acting. He manages to convey all the emotions and draw out the audiences sympathy and outrage with only his voice and movements. Natalie Portman does a fine job as Evie from her characters shock to her fear and ultimately her resolve. The story is an excellent warning about giving too much power to the government and allowing fear to guide politics. The action sequences are beautifully done but not over-done as in many movies these days. Hopefully this movie will do well and show Hollywood you don't need to be a matrix clone or a sequel/prequel to be a good film."

","I didn't really know what to think when my friend told me we were going to see the movie. I had seen the previews and didn't think it looked too good. I was very, very wrong. In the beginning the action starts off right away with Evey out past curfew and some crooked cops looking to get some. Being a ruthless killer, V slices and dices his way through his enemies, before saying a long monologue (watch for this)with words only beginning with the letter V. Although the action may slow down at moments, you learn what happened with codename V and the past just before the time of the movie. The last scenes were my favorite with the execution of Adam Sutler, a fight scene that almost rivals the lobby from the Matrix, and the entire population marching on Parlaiment. 10 out of 10, all the way."

This movie has many themes to analyze, but I think its themes are supported by other artists. ""Political language...is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind."" ""Since you don't know what Fascism is, how can you struggle against Fascism."" ""But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.""

You might expect it to be an action movie, but in reality there is actually very little action compared to many other movies that seem to be in the same category. Instead of action, V for Vendetta has an spectacular story, one that will definitely get you thinking. Another aspect of the movie that I really enjoyed was that they did not reveal the true face of V at the very end, and instead left it a mystery. I assume in the original graphic novel, his face was not revealed either, so I am glad that when it was adapted for the screen this was not changed. Anyway, highly recommended, I will definitely be purchasing it on DVD!"
"saurian_editer","Null","2","5","18 March 2006"," give this one a 10.
","Go ahead, Hugo is nothing less than spectacular. Would have been nice to see the charred face of our hero but I wasn't necessarily looking for a chop shop slasher film; V has scruples. There is more than enough blood and guts, mixed in with a really well thought and believable story line, for this movie to allow anyone to be horrified and mesmerized by our poetic and heroic vigilante. Lots of mention of classic poets, stories, and music. Story plot is not hard to follow after a sit to understand all the flashbacks that whoever directed this flick did a great job with, too. V's words and narration are only hard to follow at first because of his introduction into war torn england. But the guy is a friend under his mask. Move over Batman since you can't handle true politics even With all your money, V is a political romantic and no sissy. You were never tortured Batman, only your mind is tortured so get some meds as you watch V.<br/><br/>Since V knows that mystery, moving your home to unknown whereabouts, and a mask are his great allies; it is highly possible that this film could spawn one or two spin-offs. Hugo and Wachowski could make them believable, too. England is not the only culture in need of a whupin.<br/><br/>This film is taken from a Vertigo/DC comic that I have never read but I am now considering reading the comic. You always hear the book is better than the movie, but since I haven't read the comic itself ... we'll have to wait and see. Hell, I might even buy the mask and egg / wrap some government buildings. That chick from the last three Star Wars films is in it, I got mildly turned on when she is tortured (no rape but I always enjoy seeing untouchable actresses and actors get hurt). I didn't completely understand what exact word V was looking for when she and he were discussing her torture afterward - and then she walks into the rain, but V is following his script to the letter here. This film is not for any female who doesn't kick ass, gets nervous, and who have appreciation for the weaker things in life. I will not take my ball and chain with me if I see this film again.<br/><br/>Best scene is when he is walking from his torture cell and screaming out; the words 'screaming out' do not explain the emotion captured in the film in this particular scene. Did the guy have eyes? It wouldn't surprise me one bit if citizens of the United States dawn masks and start taking down their totalitarian government right now - but we all know that's not going to happen since it would take a person as fu**ed up, mean, charismatic, put together and just as willing to die and take the fall for everyone as the hero was in this film. Now, go watch Hugo kick your ass just like he did in the Matrix films, only this time when he seemingly dies you'll bloody cry like you did NOT when Keanu died in that horrible third film after Hugo enters him after a great pounding. If you're not political in the sense that you care about what happens to your controversial government or your 'fellow man' this movie will at least make you think of the kind of person in classic england that make of any government what it will be.<br/><br/>V has a lot to say after years of torture and near death. I need a little more time for analyzing the twists in the plot. The movie theater was packed when I went in, a lot of apes and blonds were there so I was kinda sucked in to their sniffling and punching and blankedness and grunting stupidity toward the film; this film needs less film goers around you to analyze its deeper meanings but the film is really great if you want full on action with lots of great fights and explosions and happy and pretty and smiley characters to watch the pretty colors; and too many people watching the large television that keeps your attention the whole way through. That mask is just awesome, too. The guy from Citizen X (Stephen Rea. Go watch Citizen X as soon as you can) was in it; he makes a psychologically excellent detective. With all the pressure his character is under during V he doesn't have a breakdown. V coulda rescued his poor patsy and it would have been Sutherland assisting all over again but V is no caretaker if he can help it; its the girl who is in need of rescuing in this film. You'll see what I mean when you watch Citizen X, Rea doesn't always have breakdowns in other films of his. Citizen X is just a really good fill and based on true events, too. Rea is a great actor. He's explosive, watch for his subtleties, and a great supporting actor here.<br/><br/>After you watch V, go see '16 Blocks'. You will leave the theater property feeling as if our world has some good and more than one-sided people who actually give a couple of s*its about law and government locally and nationally. Nah, the film is not worth analyzing what government is all about, there's a lot to go on otherwise but I think you can take these chancellor and grunt character's roles the same as you would anyone in your own government; most all government officials are just as shallow and lead on by scripts as any one of them in this film is. Government should be afraid of its people, not the other way around. This film has lots of great one liners that you can use to explain your sorry government.<br/><br/>Thanks, V."

","If you've ever suppressed your opinion in order to be ""part of the group"", this film will speak to you as it illustrates the attrocity of having someone enforce their way of life on others. Minorities should always beware of powerful institutions that set the one and only standard and force total conformity, because one day, those institutions could make it very uncomfortable for you to remain different.<br/><br/>The film succeeds in capturing every element of Alan Moore's masterpiece, but the change in medium from Underground Comic Book to the Big Screen does not go without a price. In order to broaden its audience to mass appeal, the film grapples at times with its own issues and becomes uneven. Brilliantly subtle in places through the use of language and symbolism, it then shifts gears and hammers home its message with deafening explosions to ensure the whole audience is on the same page. Fittingly, violence hungry fans seeking Matrix-level action may relate more with the goons that make the story's dictatorship regime possible.<br/><br/>And what are the themes...<br/><br/>Vigilante justice. Corruption at the highest levels of power. The grey line between freedom fighters and terrorists. And the courage to defy what you know is wrong, even when the odds seem overwhelming.<br/><br/>Watch this movie but then hold your tongue, you wouldn't want to be singled out for special treatment... ;)"

The addition of many many 'coincidences' was a really good idea that was very thought provoking. Depite this being a serious thriller there were many times where i burst out laughing, such as the propaganda scene where avian flu is mentioned and V performing an 'instant sex change' on a soldier, ouch.

","I watched V for Vendetta last night, (17th March), and I thought that the film deserved a topic in its own right.<br/><br/>Firstly I loved the film, i thought it was absolutely brilliant, it was delicately and beautifully directed, the CGI used was seamless and It was perfectly cast, bar from one , Evey played by Natalie Porman. Don't get me wrong, I love Natalie Portman as an actress, but for the love of god, why couldn't they just cast a British actress, Kiera Knightley would have been perfect. Portman's accent was atrocious and constantly changing, her body language was all wrong, when she should of been nervous, she stood resolutely, when she had apparently lost her fear she seemed ready to break down, she did although almost redeem herself towards the end of the film, her final scene in the underground station with Mr Finch (a beautiful adaptation by Stephen Rea) is near perfect.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving, on the other hand was perfect for 'V', when I first heard that he had been cast I, admittedly was disdainful, feeling that he had been cast only because The Wachowski Brothers wanted someone familiar, when a character who is constantly masked could be done better by CGI. His presence in the way he moves suits the character perfectly, and his voice, with its deep hollow sound, defines the character in a way that i feel no one could have anticipated.<br/><br/>Stephen Fry was an inspired choice for ' Deitrich. His flamboyant nature, is perfect for the television host. His development of the relationship between his character and Evey is both believable and Emphatic.<br/><br/>I feel that this film, will become a true classic, even with its eyebrow raising prospective on terrorism."

","It may not be the typical apocalypse or Love story but V for Vendetta is better than any masked superhero story these last few years. If you like sci-fi, historical fiction, or just a twisted love story this is the perfect movie. Girls there is enough explosions, knives, and shocking images to keep your boyfriend awake next to you despite the romantic-novelette undertones. Even if you don't like romance the primary plot line will make this movie quite worth it's ticket price. I recommend reading reviews however instead of basing your choice on the trailer. For some hardcore action fans it will have been misleading. For example the group of ""under 25"" guys I went with assumed there was no love story, and were disappointed in that fashion. The over 30 males in the audience however loved it. It's a very intelligent film and the dialog in the beginning may foul some people up. <br/><br/>I never realized so many words started with the letter V.

"gpadillo","9","2","5","17 March 2006"," Thought Provoking Action Film
","""V for Vendetta"" is going to confuse a lot of people. Nevertheless, and make no mistake about it, this is movie making of the highest order, combining all the finest elements of great storytelling into a potent roller coaster of a movie filled with great action,intellect and above all, ideas. Its message can - and will - easily be dismissed by naysayers as sophomoric or too ""out there,"" or ""anti-american"" but there is also an earnestness here that will resonate strongly, and perhaps, frighteningly, to many viewers who will not fail to see the correlation between this fictional tale and the way the world we live in works.<br/><br/>Filled with stereotypes and archetypes, ""V"" is unapologetic in its essaying of morality and in its strongly held sentiment that this tale is ""for the people, by the people."" Brothers and writers Larry and Andy Wachowski (of Matrix fame) have infused their screenplay with the anger, confusion and hope captured in Alan Moore's original graphic novel - and it's better looking as a result.<br/><br/>I truly believe that many who see ""V"" will be upset by it, but hopefully more of us will be inspired by its bold, blatant message and take a good hard look at ourselves and the way the world works around us and see that, with sacrifice and thoughtfulness, the world can be changed.<br/><br/>As Evey, Natalie Portman is cast in something of the ""victim"" role, but she makes us route for her, and to her credit she goes beyond that making the transformation of her character not only believable, but in the end, noble.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving - the man behind the mask - gives a performance that can only be described as mesmerizing. As ""V"" he exposes all of the strength and weakness of a character that it equal parts savior and villain.<br/><br/>The physical production is beautiful in its realism as it paints a nightmarish world of the not-very-distant future (2020) and is chilling in its depiction of governmental power, socio-political corruption and, ultimately, the complacency of its citizens. Weaving's ""V"" challenges, and ultimately changes all of that, as he quickly unravels the fabric of civilized society, capturing the public with his bold ideas - and with the promise and permanency of change through rebellion and in political uprising.<br/><br/>Most chillingly, this film invokes the dread once feared in ""1984"" with a renewed vigor that brings home all the horrors Orwell foresaw, are still available in our comfy modern world. Chilling? You betcha! For those who know the novel, there is little skimping, and, given the current world situation, one must absolutely applaud the filmmakers for ""going there"" as far as the ending is concerned. This is film making at its emotional and challenging best.<br/><br/>Are there flaws? Of course there are, but ultimately ""V for Vendetta"" rises above them presenting a world of ideas that have forever been debated, in a story well told, beautifully acted and full of hope for humankind. Not bad work for a movie. Actually, it's magnificent."

","When the DVD contains some of the deleted scenes in the 10 ""comic books"" than I would rate this movie even higher. I read the novels as they were coming out in the late 1980's and this movie although it tries in spirit has a long way to go to equaling the philosophical, social and political import of the 380 page Alan Moore graphic novel. Without a doubt one of the most significant political movies to come out of Hollywood in decades. Natalie Portman was a surprising choice and was well-suited to the role even though I originally had doubts after the wooden acting in the SW trilogy. For all of those out there who liked Hugo Weaving in his many roles he is perhaps at the apex of his game in this movie without ever once showing his face.

I loved the dark color schemes - red and black being my favorite color combination. THe storyline was fantastic and the character dynamics played into the plot well. The totalitarian ideals upheld by the society's government are definitely something we as free human beings need to rise up against.

","Although the comic's writer, Alan Moore, is extremely unhappy of DC Comic's allowance to the filmmakers to take such an extent with the film, which they did, the story presented in the movie is both riveting and excellent. In order to enjoy the movie, I feel it is necessary to place oneself outside the comic. For all literature is always open to criticism and interpretation. The movie was visually outstanding; the dialogue was phenomenal (although some would believe it to be farcical and silly); the music selection was excellent; and the manner in which the plot was revealed to the viewer was awesome. Where the movie fails...I would be hard pressed to think of too many areas other than the subject of the story? Many would find a story of dystopian society overused, overplayed, and boring at this point; however, V for Vendetta comes through with brilliance. It has a certain ""je ne sais quoi"" about it. I think that this movie will sit on the shelf proudly with other dystopian media such as A Brave New World, 1984, The Matrix, Equilibrium, and many more for years to come."

The build up and execution of the ending sequence is conducted masterfully and was quite impressive. I am generally not too fond of Natalie Portman's other movies, least ways, I was not impressed with her characters so much, but in this one she does very well indeed. There is a lot of emotion in this film and a lot of lofty ideas. It is very entertaining. Additionally, the character 'V' is quite possibly the most interesting hero I have seen in some time, and extremely capable in all that he does.There are things that you will want to know more about and a couple things that are simply not explained all that well or at all, but none of these minor blemishes detract in any significant fashion from the movie.<br/><br/>See it!"

Mein Gott.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta looks like a BBC Telemovie drama production beamed forwards from the early years when digital motion images were novel and Saturday night TV was still in its post Dixon of Dock Green phase. It contents the usual BBC social engineering proselytization but with a simplistic retro feel of mid-Blairite era that makes it look naïve and primitive by this weeks must have in identity politics et al. <br/><br/>It gets worse. The script oozes clichés and low end predictability from start to finish. Say it before it happens. Its like an ideology film for 10 year old's and believers in the idealist fantasy of Marxist pedagogy. For that you'd need the check list of every populist evil anti-christ of the period and tick them off as they wander by with only Rupert Murdoch missing. Guanatanamo Oranges and John Hurt's Winston from Radford's 1984 now replacing the Enoch Powell look-a-like big screen Evil Leader is a nice touch.<br/><br/>What did they spend $54m on? Natalie Portman in pink and white dress as an entertainment based paedo-trap for evil Bishop? <br/><br/>The sets for want of a better word are low budget digitised or the tea room at the office. Most of the film is a fight for crap-rights between bad acting and rubbish dialogue. The Autopsy scene is cringe-worthy.

","Firstly, I must say how much it saddens me with regard to many of the quite frankly idiotic comments made about this wonderful film.<br/><br/>Lets first take the charge of Natalie Portman's wooden acting. Her flawless English accent, her generation of power and emotion - quite rightly she was nominated for an Oscar. Then there is the case of the poor production quality - were these people watching the same film? The visual imagery of the the film at times is breathtaking. The opening sequence with the explosion at the Old Bailey to the finale of the 1812 Overture and the end sequence with the same set piece on the Houses of Parliament were spectacular. And all tied in with a wonderful piece of English History about the infamous Gunpowder Plot. Priceless!! <br/><br/>This is exactly how films should be made - thought provoking which extract a meaningful debate. The moral dilemma as to how much power we should hand over to the state and whether a terrorist is indeed a terrorist or a champion of the people. The protection of civil liberties and the rights for everyone, whatever their creed or sexual persuasion, to be able to exercise free speech, and even more poigniantly, the role of propaganda in the control of the masses.<br/><br/>I am not a political person, I'm not a student or an anarchist, I am just a normal average Joe who can see the power and intensity of a film that is a little too close to reality for comfort. Many of the comments made denouncing the film as trash are made by the very same people that the film eludes that we should be wary and fearful of.<br/><br/>These film snobs will no doubt have given it a 10 star if it had been directed by Stanley Kubrick. I for one, see every film on its individual merits. Yes it slows a little in the middle, yes there may be a subtle hint of cliché from time to time but it is such a compelling tale with a 'now' factor that cannot be ignored.<br/><br/>A must have in any DVD collection, V for Vendatta, taps into our social conscience and turns it on its head - BRAVO!!!!"

","V for Vendetta. Is an e enjoyable and sometimes irritating film. The film is full of substance for a comic book. The movie spends a great deal of time showing us the Fascist Totalitarian State of Britain and it captures it quite well. The movies politics are a major hindrance however and little insulting. The Christian Bishop is a pedophile and ex military commander and Stephen Fry's character calls the Koran beautiful. The movie could have done without those two scenes. The movie is certainly light on logic as V is easily able to get at his enemies in a totalitarian state! Natalie Portman gives a crappy performance and is not believable as British. Her accent and acting are poor. I think Keira Knigtley would have worked much better in the role. The supporting cast of Oscar Nominees Stephen Rea and John Hurt are largely wasted. The character of V is very derivative and echos a little bit Phantom of the Opera, Zorro, Man of La Mancha, and little bit of the architect from the Matrix sequels. The direct and script are sometimes poor as the action and story are less than impressive. The film has some great moments is often preposterous largely thanks to a heavy handed script and equally heavy handed direction. End result 5/10 Average. Not worthy of the Top 250."

Natalie Portman CAN'T ACT, OK so I'm being a little harsh here, but after watching her in 3 Star Wars prequels( which giving birth I'm sure is less painful than that ) I cannot stand her and do not rate her at all when it comes to acting. YES she looks good, no wait she looks good WITH hair not WITHOUT, another reason to hate this movie. The problem with the film is its trying to make a serious political statement, warning us of how governments can have too much control almost like a dictatorship even in a democratic society. How we are all being brain washed through the governmental controlled media to discriminate against whatever the government wants us to. V's cause is to inspire the little people to stand up against them and let them know the they hold the key to power and change. Basically its an attack on the Bush/Blair nanny state governments......well YAWN YAWN YAWN. If, and I say IF I want to watch a film with such a serious tone I will watch Schindler's list or Crash, NOT an idiot anti-superhero in a mask endlessly talking about it when he should be out their trying to catch the riddler or something. If your going to make a movie with a serious political statement and you do not want to use a conventional storyline do it like Dr Stranglove, NOT like this. I rarely have been as annoyed when walking out of the cinema as I was after this. I seem to be in the minority by not liking this movie, but I really cannot see why so many people rave about this film.

The whole film looks fantastic, the camera work and editing are smooth and stylish and the costume and set design are sophisticated. The score/soundtrack was also effective, enhancing the atmosphere when it needed to and had some memorable parts too.<br/><br/>The lighting is brooding and like the score enhance the atmosphere effectively. The idea was also intriguing.<br/><br/>Cons: What didn't work for me was the plot, things weren't explained very well or were underdeveloped, it was sluggish and it just had a very shallow feel to it. I didn't care for the characters either, like the plot they were underdeveloped and and lacked any sort of depth. The script is often stilted, the direction lacked efficiency and despite the cast the acting didn't work for me either.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving has moments when he is commanding but his weak dialogue let him down, also the characterisation itself seemed threadbare. Natalie Portman seems wooden here, while great actors like John Hurt are underused or forgettable, in regard to Hurt what was even more disappointing was that he suffered from both these things.<br/><br/>All in all, I just didn't care for V for Vendetta, despite the stunning visuals, atmospheric music and the interesting concept. 4/10 Bethany Cox"

Everything about V was just as mysterious and intriguing as I imagined it. V looked just as he did in the graphic novel, same black cape, same knives and the same Guy Fawkes mask. In other words, the cinematic clone of a perfect graphic novel character! Excellent stuff! Why people hated this movie is beyond me...most reviews I have seen are good but a large majority are bad...I say they need to read the novel and then see the movie a couple more times.

This obviously was written by a bunch of anti-war, Christian-hating (making Christians look like Hitler), homosexual activists (based on the line, ""Why do they hate us (homosexuals) so much (but of course it's OK if they hate Christians)) liberals who's obvious intent for the movie was to use it as a bully pulpit to express their liberal activism. I'm sure, like most liberals, when they said ""America's war"" they were referring to the War On Terror which wasn't America's war anymore than WWII was ""Great Britain's war"" because they were defending themselves against the Germans. It's amazing how ungrateful these British liberals are. Their country would be hardly more than finely pummeled dust if the United States hadn't entered the war to help them. How quickly these people become ungrateful.<br/><br/>Too bad the liberals who produced this move REALLY DO NOT believe the theme and other themes that were presented in the movie, making the movie a bit hollow. One of the especially great themes is the theme stated by V who said, ""People should not fear their government. Government should fear their people."" which is an adaptation to Thomas Jefferson's quote of ""When the people fear their government, there is tyranny; when the government fears the people, there is liberty.""<br/><br/>Another hypocritical aspect of the movie is they just LOATHED ""America"" for fighting their ""war"" (Oh, those warmongering ""Americans"" are SO VIOLENT!), but V waging war was great and glorious. The hypocrisy and two faced liberal activism put a huge damper on this movie for me, ESPECIALLY because of the hypocrisy."

","I went into this movie not expecting much. The previews looked rather hokey on first glance, sort of like a ""B"" movie take on a silly comic book character.<br/><br/>Watching this movie however, I was fascinated from the beginning.<br/><br/>I believe Hugo Weaving deserved an Oscar for his performance as ""V"". To create such a deep, fascinating, and sympathetic character without ever showing his face has to rank among the greatest acting achievements ever put on film.<br/><br/>The dialog in the film was fantastic, almost poetic at times, again due in large part to Weaving's performance. I understand much of it was taken virtually word for word from the graphic novel, which is now on my ""must read"" list.<br/><br/>I was also a fan of Stephen Rea's performance as Inspector Finch. His tired, professional dignity, working in support of a government he was very wary of, was perfect.<br/><br/>But most of all, I loved the message of this movie. It is in the nature of all governments to gradually limit freedom, even governments with relatively benevolent beginnings. This occurs incrementally, and with noble sounding intentions. V for Vendetta can serve as a wake-up call for how far this trend can go if not arrested.<br/><br/>See this movie. You will not be sorry."

Nataly Portman delivers one more time and Hugo... we do not get to see his face for even a second during the entire length of the film yet his performance carries out every little emotion his character has. The photography shows us a futuristic London not very hard to imagine while the music of the film suits perfectly every scene.<br/><br/>For those who love suspense this is a must-see.

For an actor to deliver such a stunning performance and yet never show his face, is something truly amazing and indeed rare. I can think of no other actor than Hugo Weaving who could deliver such a performance. Stunning!

Hugo Weaving was badly handicapped by the mask, and he basically sounded as if he were narrating a children's story to be sold on CD.<br/><br/>There were some Americanisms that jarred in the British setting, such as 'protest something' for 'protest AGAINST something' and the pronunciation 'levver' for 'lever' (which is pronounced like 'leaver' in British English).<br/><br/>It would be suitable for children and young teenagers if it weren't for some of the content and language.

I am honestly amazed that American audiences bought so cheaply such a clear reversal of values, just for the sake of entertainment, and even go so far as claiming that this utterly stupid creation carried a powerful message. Apparently, just because the action was set in London and in the future, people here feel comfortable that this does not really concern them.

Perhaps if I had just taken a contemporary American society class at a liberal college this film would have dazzled me (that was me SEVERAL years ago), but the social commentary is nothing new to me now. I found the film to be old news and a bad photocopy of a lot of other films and ethics textbooks.<br/><br/>Basically the film romanticizes terrorism as a way to defeat a fascist government. The funny thing is that the government sets up the illusion of the country being threatened by terrorists doing biological warfare, when the government actually created these experiments in the first place. One of the experiments gets free and has a vendetta against the government. It has a similar plot to the recent Aeon Flux film without the cloning factor. The film also romanticizes homosexuality in an oppressive, Christian society. I'm not judging these aspects here, I just wanted to summarize the themes.<br/><br/>My main problems with the film: I found the characters to be two-dimensional, the plot to be predictable and the pacing to be painfully slow. The visuals were dark except for the scene with a pedophile bishop and lesbians falling in love. I didn't find the film inspiring. The dreary style and tone of the film dragged. Also the monologues kept pushing the same ideas. By the end, I didn't care what point the film was trying to make (I knew that within the first five minutes of the film from a long monologue). I just felt beaten down with repetition after two hours of being slapped in the face with liberalism. The theme didn't matter. It could have been fascism or Christianity and I would have felt the same way with this style of film-making<br/><br/>I wish I had just rented the director's cut of Blade Runner.

"drwolffenstein","1","5","21","10 September 2009"," Genuinely scary political correct propaganda.
","I didn't go to the movies to see this one. I saw it on television and I hated it from the first battle with those security officers. Let me say why. Using Tsjaikovski's 1812 overture is a complete misuse of it. Tsjaikovski wrote the piece to celebrate the victory of the Russian armies against the armies of Napoleon. Napoleon, as we all should know, was a product of the French Revolution. The French Revolution was heavily anti-Christian and heavily anti-monarch while the Russian monarchy was heavily Christian and aristocratic. That is in complete contradiction with the theme of the movie. Since the intellectual explanation of the use of this piece just doesn't work I suspect the creators of this movie choose the piece because it has a lot of noise in it the last 15 minutes. This explanation is pretty shameful for a movie that pretends to be intellectual and ground-breaking.<br/><br/>But these shameful intellectual mistakes go on and on and on. Take by example the Islamic terrorists who are, later in the movie, suddenly not responsible for their actions. Just like the thought that Muslim extremists doing actual harm was just too much asked. Talking about Islam, you should look up how Christians and basically everyone else is threaded by their fellow Islamic citizens in Islamic countries. And no, you won't see that in this movie.<br/><br/>This movie takes political correctness to a level that is genuinely scary. All gays, lesbians, Muslims and the chief-terrorist V are happy campers while Christians, the building of the British parliament (one of the centers of battle against Nazism), police, the army are the symbols of hate and oppression. The rest of this movie is basically the same. The pharmaceutical company (symbolizes finance capitalism that brought the welfare everyone here in Europe lives in) is the staging ground of fascism. However blatant and unsubtle it never gets original.<br/><br/>There is however a link to the book 1984 that people will easily miss. And it is called ""doublespeak"". The EngSoc regime in 1984 destroyed the concept of freedom by destroying it linguistically or turning it around. Freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength, war is peace. This movie does exactly the same with Christianity. The movie's tag-line should be ""Islam is good, capitalism is fascism and dictatorship is bad"". Not very original you say? Well, neither is this movie so it does fit quite good.<br/><br/>This movie is bad. Not bad in a way that is innocent. Like those hack&slash horror movies are bad but don't do anyone much harm. But bad in a way that it is next of being evil because dumb people might actually fall for the trap of believing this propaganda. And propaganda always works if it isn't opposed. You should read something about the verbal poison Joseph Goebbels produced to know that.<br/><br/>1/10<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie that actually shows what it is like to resist to an oppressor, see the movie ""Sophie Scholl"". It has, contrary to this movie a believable ending, believable bad guys and some real good acting."

I didn't swear or use any coarse comments but I was expressing myself and it appears that I was censored for some reason although I don't know why. This seems relevant as the film itself deals with these very issues and I'm afraid that when freedom of expression is censored by a computer then we really are in deep trouble. I'm toning down my feelings but lets just say that I feel this film plays into the NWO hands.

Okay no problem there, though there is enough action and of a type of action to keep it from being taken to seriously and way way way way way too much talk talk talk talk talk talk talk to be engaging mentally. Ideas if repeated many many times do not become deeper.<br/><br/>Character motivation is likewise repeated at every key moment that you might have forgotten. This is a movie that is concerned it's too smart for you dummies in the audience. In its arrogance it forgets to be much good or have any narrative drive. <br/><br/>Characters on several occasions get magically kidnapped to keep the story going, a protracted flashback to a subplot right in the middle is really the time to turn it off.<br/><br/>A misfire, good intentions I guess, aren't really deeply thought out nor is anything in this ultimately. The subversion here just seems kind of childish. The bombers are our friends? Gutsy premise but they don't pull it off. Silly Portman underwear sequences belong in another movie perhaps one more entertaining and sure of itself than this ultimate mess.<br/><br/>This will all seem really odd in future years, for now it's just for the armchair crowd who can't be bothered to really study current events but can, I guess, get some vicarious thrill from this.

"StoryCharts","1","2","6","8 August 2013"," Bravery will bring down a dictatorship
","V for Vendetta is about the idea that bravery will bring down a dictatorship. It tries to demonstrate this with four plots. The main plot is about the revolution to overthrow the fascist government, which succeeds. This plot succeeds because of V's bravery in the face of oppression, and is supported by society's refusal to take it anymore. Society's rise to arms is demonstrated by two internal plots: that of Evey's growing bravery to the point of being willing to die to protect her freedom and that of the inspector general refusing to carry out orders for an oppressive government. Evey's arc is also accompanied by her growing love for V.<br/><br/>The story ends with society taking up V's call to arms and marching on parliament to overthrow the government.<br/><br/>The movie has numerous references to Nazi Germany and tries to make a point that revenge for its own sake is not the end goal, rather, overcoming fear to stand up for what's right is paramount. This is highlighted by the ending whereby V does not blow up the parliament on his own but leaves it to the people.<br/><br/>It's a great idea.<br/><br/>But the movie didn't work for me. Mostly because the beginning raised the stakes so much that the turning points leading to the end felt inconsequential or unbelievable. We go from the first 10 minutes where:<br/><br/>Evey goes on a date past curfew, whereby she is: Harassed by the police with threat of rape, whereby: V saves her by beating the police up, V goes onto blow up the courts From there, the movie gets to work to lay out each of the plots. The problem for me is the first 10 minutes setup a world where hyperbole rules. This fantastical setup presents an extreme world that makes the rest of the movie's twists and turns hard to believe since the beginning setup two omniscient parties: the government and V.<br/><br/>Great idea, just didn't work for me.<br/><br/>My Story Chart for the movie is at storycharts.ca."

","I loved this movie, but I love what it could've (and should've) been a lot more. James McTeigue directs the film version of Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel, one that easily ranks as one of my favorite graphic novels. In the film, young Evey is rescued by a mysterious stranger in a Guy Fawkes mask who goes by the name V. She is soon brought into his world as he exacts his revenge against those who've wronged him and plots against the totalitarian government reigning over England. This film was McTeigue's first run as director and he did a fantastic job with the heavy subject matter, high profile cast, and dense storyline of Moore/Lloyd's novel.<br/><br/>I had not read the book before seeing this film in theaters, and I think that's why my love for it wasn't completely tainted. I was able to view the movie with a clean slate and enjoy it for what it was. After reading the novel, I can definitely understand why Alan Moore would've gotten so upset with its film adaptation. The film trimmed a lot of story and character development in an effort to fit it all into a two hour runtime, which is a shame. There was so much more to the story that I wish could've been included. In my opinion, the movie would've been better off being turned into a trilogy, in which each of the book's three chapters could've acted as a standalone film in one three-part saga, allowing for the full story to play out.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that's not the case, but the movie was still great. A fan of the book couldn't have asked for better casting, with strong performances from Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, John Hurt, Stephen Rea, and Stephen Fry. The cast was each perfectly suited for their roles; you'd almost think the book was written with these actors in mind for each character. I noticed that the movie feels a lot longer than it actually is because of how much story is crammed into the two hours, but it never drags and it never becomes difficult to follow the dense plot. On top of that, the film has some great action scenes; I loved seeing V in action with his daggers. Forgiving the fact that the movie had a lot more potential that may never be realized in future cinema, McTeigue's film is a great action flick with strong messages behind it that I feel everyone should see at least once."

","The V for Vendetta graphic novel would surely have been loved by Stanley Kubrick and the V for Vendetta movie is surely one Kubrick would have loved to direct.<br/><br/>In the future, England is over run by a totalitarian government made possible by an evil conspiracy that left several hundred's dead and one horribly scarred survivor whom the government would rather forget. In other words, England has become the country Hitler wanted the whole world to be back in the forties, and there's one man out there determined to change that. He goes by the name V, expertly wields a set of knives, knows all kinds of ways to kick your ass and proudly sports a Guy Fawkes mask. Guy Fawkes was a man in English history who was hung for trying to blow up the parliament building in the 17th century, and now V is determined to finish what he started and along the way rally the population of England against their fascist government.<br/><br/>The film is loaded with historical references and their modern day parallels, political connotations and in its own way debates the rights and wrongs, causes and effects of activism. It encourages freedom of speech and the righteous stance but does this all within the context of an action movie. V is basically a terrorist standing up for the little guy, he goes about the film raising hell, blowing up monuments, picking off those who done him wrong and doing his best to make it clear to everybody that things need to change, and he's only gonna be the beginning.<br/><br/>There are scenes in this movie that can stand next to many of the great action flicks and some that can ride alongside that of a political thriller. There are some slower moments here too, but they're so enriched with great acting and story telling that you can hardly fault the makers for slouching on the pace...especially when it all builds to its big finale.<br/><br/>This film may very well not be for everybody, which in of itself is a good reason to compare it Kubrick. It's a smart action movie with a bit of interesting commentary. The morality of it all in my mind comes second to the spectacle of it all, but it's a great add on to a solidly entertaining film."
"TooDarkMark","10","2","6","15 July 2008"," The Best Alan Moore Adaption Yet (And Only One Worth It)
","I write this before Watchmen which I have high hopes for, but V For Vendetta is the best film adaption of an Alan Moore story/concept and one of the 5 best movies ever made.<br/><br/>Alan Moore's stories/concepts have had a HORRIBLE run in Hollywood (League Of Extraordinary, Constantine, From Hell), and I can understand why he would never want anything to do with the people who have so blatantly ruined his vision. But V For Vendetta was not one of those movies.<br/><br/>This movie came along during an important time. Most movies, TV and music were afraid to challenge the emerging fascism of the neo-conservative movement. All were afraid to handle the ideas and concepts behind the fear tactics used by fascist regimes. But V For Vendetta challenged those conceptions in 1981 and again the movie challenged them in 2004. I am ALWAYS against changes being made to source material, but this movie handled it amazingly and did the RIGHT thing.<br/><br/>Even someone who doesn't care for politics would enjoy this movie. Great acting, great vision, good action, and everything about it get's a 10 rating from me."

","V for Vendetta is a repeat for me, a repeat in the sense that I can watch it time and time again and still get excited about the message. This film is extremely profound for me as it touches on many subjects that are somewhat intimidating to talk about in our every day circles. As I watch V for Vendetta, I get the sense that I am currently living in the time depicted in the film with the homeland spying, the tightly controlled borders, and the word terrorist being thrown around and into every speech and display of propaganda. I feel like some people have a great understanding of where our world may be headed and James Mc Teigue just so happens to be one of them."

I had missed the 1st few minutes of the film (joined it as V was starting his symphony to blow up the Bailey). I can't believe I missed the ""verbose"" intro of V! LOL I was completely engulfed by the film and I was so satisfied that I bought it on Ebay the next day and I've watched it several times since. John Hurt playing his reverse role from 1984 was hilarious! The similarities of the regime to Nazi Germany were obvious, as were the members of the cabinet. I particularly enjoyed Evey's incarceration ""twist"". <br/><br/>I highly recommend the film!"
"Danielramos16","10","2","6","22 June 2008"," One of the greatest graphic novel based films to come out!!!
","I remember all the hype about this film, and for me this is one of the few films that lived up to the hype. Lets face it this film deals with some very controversial subjects in a very troubled time period; War, Terrorism, Totalitarianism, Racism, Liberalism, and what ever other ism that's getting out of control. This film is a Action, Superhero, mystery, and comic book movie rolled up into one. Unlike so many other films put out today, this is a very intelligent & thoughtful action movie. I also noticed that it's very controversial, the vast majority love this film, but others seem to radically hate this movie with a passion.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is based off a British graphic novel by Alan Moore that was published in the early 80's. Now there are differences between the Novel and the film but it's the same story. In a future Great Britain a masked vigilante known only as V, fights to bring down the Fascist Government (Norsefire) that rules Britain with an Iron Fist. I know the film makers altered the story from the novel, but only to become more relevant & meaningful in our times. For example; Norsefire came to power during a Nuclear War between Cold War enemies (likely the U.S. & U.S.S.R) which caused famine & economic collapse world wide, in the movie they came to power in the aftermath of a deadly Terrorist attack by Islamic Extremists. Just think; The Roman Republic turned into an Empire with the rise of Julius Caesar because of instability & corruption, Adolf Hitler & the Nazis came to power in Germany after the Reichstag was burnt down by Communists (as they claimed), The Taliban came to power in Afghanistan because the people were desperate for peace & security after years of Civil War, and the Terrorist attacks on America led George W. Bush's controversial conduct in fighting terrorism. When people are scared and insecure they will turn to anyone who can promise to change things, even turn a blind eye to their own governments crimes. The movie goes off the scenario that Americas War on Terror has gotten completely out of control, and seemingly has only embolden terrorism against America and it's Ally Great Britain. A terrifying irony is that this films release was delayed because of Terrorist attacks on London by Al Queda. So imagine if a party like Norsefire came to power because of people's fears of of the time, this film suddenly seemed more realistic. The portrayal of this Future Britain is smart, relevant, and terrifying. Drawing resemblance to Nazi Germany and that of the current political landscape. The Government targets Homosexuals, Political opponents, and non-British minorities for extermination or deportation. Many are sent to detention facilities which draw resemblance to Guantanimo Bay & Abu Ghraib. Now in the film V is portrayed more of a Freedom fighter then an crazed Anarchist in the novel, but few notice he does still remain true to his roots. His actions are meant to cause chaos & disillusionment, we even hear it said as his Revolution gains steam. The anarchy he stirs up is meant so that the government would show it's true colors, exposing their violent & ruthless tactics so that the people will not only question the Norsefire but turn against it. V is the most Intelligent & sophisticated hero ever then again, but like the novel it's questionable whether he is a heroic freedom fighter or a borderline psychotic. He has so much charisma & intelligence yet there are times we really have to ask ourselves ""Is this dude crazy"" Like the novel his past is a mystery, we only know he was a victim of the Governments atrocities, and like the novel his tactics are questioned by Natalie Portman's character. V is like many famous Revolutionaries of our time, but it's questioned whether their all motivated by a morale creed or their own personal desires. <br/><br/>The action sequences are bloody and amazing, mixing in elements of comics. This is more of a character driven film then action oriented, but it works for the better. We really feel for the characters and it's more about them then it is about action & special effects. Stephen Rea is very soulful & thoughtful, Natalie Portman isn't perfect but there are moments when her performance is actually quite memorable, John Hurt is absolutely chilling as the British Dictator Adam Sutler, but it's Hugo Weaving who gives the performance of his career as V. You never see his true face or learn his identity, its just how he talks & moves which is so brilliant. With the current political landscape of today this film is fun, entertaining, yet thought provoking, and chilling.V For Vendetta is a classic destined to be talked about for years to come."
"merdiolu","10","2","6","1 June 2008"," Can you say Perfection ?
","I had never read Alan Moore's original comic before. In fact I had very little fore knowledge what V for Vendetta was all about before entering theater. All I know it was about dystopia (I have a weak spot about productions like that ) , totalitarianism and one hero's struggle...I sat down and get up when the movie finished. But but I couldn't think or do anything anymore. I was in a sensory overload. This movie was so full of ideas , messages , style , drama. Especially for a comic...Messages of this movie relevant even today and will continue to be important even tomorrow.<br/><br/>Development of characters are superb at least. And acting oh God considering acting of today as wise ass lame one liners and having cool exterior , can any word marvelous British stage acting we see here. Hugo Weaving as V an anti hero not perfect just tragic and dramatic main lead was magnificent. His actions as I mentioned combined with his literature and art makes him number one hero among comic book adaptations in my list. Natalie Portman holds on very well also , not disappears but slowly taking up lead with radical character change of Evey. Stephen Rea is mesmerizing as honest police detective Eric Finch who is struggling to find V but meanwhile slowly opening up his eyes and realizing what kind of regime he is serving in. John Hurt is pleasing to watch as totalitarian dictator of Oceania no...sorry England 'ahem' Tim Piggott Smith is Creedy as malevolent chief of secret police organization , Gestapo like ""Finger"", Stephen Fry as TV show comedian who lost his taste because of the state everyone forced to live in. Roger Allam and John Standing perverted members of Norsefire party , demagogue TV commenter and sick priest. Natasha Wightman as Valerie a cry from past...Whew no more words to describe their awesome performance.<br/><br/>George Orwell's 1984 , history of Nazi Germany and current state of affairs and administration of US are clear inspirations behind this movie. Editing of James McTeigue is marvelous especially in domino scene...I will cut it short. After watching this beauty , a reminder of why cinema is an art , not just an industry of money making , V for Vendetta became one of the defining term of excellence in movie making with ""Shawshank Reeedmption"" , ""Green Mile"""

It annoys me how people have the attention span of a gold fish and forget the great movies for the media band wagon that drives the latest drivvle on the big screen. I do not dislike this movie, quite the opposite, however; there is so much more that could have been done with this movie. The action I thought overall were pretty decent but there was a serious lack of them. The movie itself seemed too limited in a way that made the story seem weaker than it shouldve been. Overall I give this movie a 5 and think that an opportunity was wasted here to make this a classic."

","I found this movie very useful. It seems to me that this movie had a strong sociological background which made the movie structured and natural. The movie is a very scary political thriller, and this movie seems to foreshadow the condition of the world in a few years time. What scared me really was what will happen in V for Vendetta would be recreated in a real scenario in our country! The movie had a very mysterious air into it which drew the viewer to watch it to the end. I was just a little led off at the part where Evie was imprisoned. All in all, the movie is not only something to enjoy. It is also something to learn from."
"Kerridwyn","10","2","6","18 December 2007"," A blast... quite a few of them
","As someone who can be a bit of a purist about book-to-movie adaptations, part of me feels I shouldn't give V for Vendetta 10 out of 10 because it does stray quite far from its graphic novel source material... but to heck with it, I loved the movie so much I just don't care.<br/><br/>No, it's not entirely Alan Moore's story. The love interest in pumped up, the politics is wound down, but for a Hollywood offering it's still pretty subversive, particularly when you consider that a group of people showing up outside the Houses of Parliament in masks would be subject to arrest under today's laws.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta delivers on both the action and the emotion. It's stylish, sharp, full of timely commentary on the stage of the world, and has a cast full of British greats. Hugo Weaving delivers a marvelous performance, particularly when you consider that he has no facial expression to work with and has to rely entirely on gesture and voice.<br/><br/>This is a film that makes me laugh, cry, cheer, kiss Stephen Fry on the lips, and do things to V which are unsuitable for description in an IMDb review. So, 10 out of 10 it gets."
"iowane","10","2","6","3 November 2007"," Hope that we might awaken
","The fact is that no matter what you might think of this adaptation of the graphic novel or the methods used by V to achieve his ends, the production values (extremely high!) or the acting, what it tells us about ourselves and where we are currently heading makes it an absolutely worthwhile film to watch.<br/><br/>The film takes place in a dystopian future that is very nearly the present for much of what is still known as the ""free world."" Wars and disease had shocked people into submission and a power hungry dictator filled the gap in their minds with mock security and peace. Sound familiar? Endless war, countless diseases, the fear of the terrorist under the bed? The film is hardly novel in its portrayal of a dystopian future. This same future was envisioned by Orwell and Kafka, in the film Brazil and by countless others. What is unique to V for Vendetta is the hope it provides amidst such a bleakly accurate portrayal of crumbling humanity.<br/><br/>In case you haven't seen the film, I won't give the ending away. In fact, it isn't precisely the ending of the film that lends the note of home, anyway. For me, this hope comes from hearing someone else say the truth in a meaningful way, allowing for the possibility that others will hear it and something will be sparked within them.<br/><br/>As V puts it in the film: ""Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who's to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler. He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent."" That dystopian future is our immediate future. WATCH THIS FILM. Open your eyes and decide if this is the future you really want for yourself. Stop giving your silent, obedient consent to suppression of your humanity."
"TDeMona","10","2","6","3 November 2007"," W for wow
","I have to say, I am not a huge fan of Wachovski brothers. Sure, I liked the first Matrix and all, but not those ""bad"" things that followed it: a huge mass of brainless, purely action-oriented rip-off movies with the central point in massive effects on the count of character development and plot. The sequels to Matrix also fell into this grey mess: all the intellectual sides of the first one were sacrificed totally.<br/><br/>So, for this, I was not expecting much from this movie. I knew I'd probably like the graphic novel, but I feared it would be completely raped and mutilated into just another Matrix-clone. My little brother bought the DVD cheaply from somewhere and forced me to watch the movie. And what a surprise it was! The story is fantastic: the thematic questions of anarchy vs. order, tolerance vs. intolerance, freedom vs. ""protection""... all those things we as voters decide year after year, that are age-old, always important concepts are very well pondered in this film. Should we destroy everything we can't understand? Should we use the easy way of iron rule for the sake of our own well-being? Should we help the less fortunate? And still, the movie manages to entertain all the way through. The drama of characters gets you from the first scene. V is such an outstanding character; he says he is more an idea than a man, and that became so for me. All the glory to John Hurt, Hugo Wieving and Natalie Portman, who were all spot-on brilliant. The direction was brilliant: the movie became a true epic, both with visually and personally. The lesbian love flashbacks in the middle completely broke my heart. The movie was full of surprises and plot twists.<br/><br/>Also, after reading the graphic novel I dear to complement Watchovski Brothers for one of the best comic adaptations of all time. Themes and character and events have been slightly changed, but that's only for the best of the film. I know some people complain about the changes, but I do not. I rejoice for both versions of this brilliant story."
"haydnbbb","9","2","6","15 October 2007"," thought -provoking movie
","Most of the BTNesque reviews in the press slamming V for Vendetta for supposedly inspiring and promoting terrorism are amusing and frankly naive. People who fear that this film would be used for war propaganda by that man in the mountain are sadly mistaken. It just shows how many have little understanding of the culture and psyche of their foe. Militants would not rely on Hollywood to seduce the gullible. They despise the West and would more likely destroy this movie and its makers than promote or applaud their work.<br/><br/>That said, allow me to give my two cents' worth. There are very few movies now that elicit such a strong and diverse reaction from its viewers. Admit it. Those Spidey movies et al.(which I adore by the way) would never spark a heated debate at the water cooler, right? And THAT is this movie's main strength. It is not Weaving's wonderfully hypnotic voice, it is not the credible performance of Portman and the rest of the cast, it is not the stunning visuals, or the beautiful and lyrical script, but it is its ability to draw a gut-wrenching response from people--hatred/loathing/pity/love/fear.<br/><br/>I have experienced living in a country under a ruthless dictatorship while people wallowed in poverty. This movie reminded me once again that Machiavellian mentality is not as uncommon as we think. Brutality is not confined to one person, place, race or religion. I have met people like Creedy, Sutler, and yes even V-- corrupt and power-hungry politicians and misguided anarchists with messianic complexes who believe that it is only in destroying that one can rebuild.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was not intended by the creators (yes, yes their primary goal was to capitalize on current issues to make money), but this slick popcorn fare will surprisingly force you to think and evaluate your own values and to once again believe in the power, not of violence, but of CHOICE.<br/><br/>Something IS wrong with this world and it is up to you to decide why it is so. It is as if a mirror was put in front of you. What would you see? Hero or villain? Apathy, bravery or treachery? Whatever your answer is one thing is for sure:this film is troubling,haunting and tragic--a story of doomed love, betrayal, vengeance and regret that I will not, or simply cannot, forget."

Boy was I wrong. This movie was intelligent, visually stunning and superbly acted by a strong cast. From the start there was never a dull moment with an expertly crafted thought-provoking plot.

","When I first went to see this movie, I had no idea what to expect of it. From what I saw of the trailers, it appeared to be a good action-packed movie, and it was actually mere chance that I went to see this one. When I saw it, I had no idea yet that there was actually also a comic series. I always think this as a good thing, since I didn't have any prejudice about it, and looked at it with a sober and neutral view.<br/><br/>I was literally amazed by this movie's brilliance. During the first break, I was so stunned I never got any food or drink, just wanted to see how it continued.<br/><br/>This movie has a great story, great plot line, which is explained throughout the movie. It's easy to understand, and the main character is really brilliantly played. Even though he wears a mask and you don't get to see his face, you can really sympathize with him, and his views are really interesting.<br/><br/>The movie has everything, great moral plots, interesting drama, good action, and it's filmed in a brilliant style, which not only makes the story easy to understand, but also gives a good understanding of all the major characters in a movie.<br/><br/>In the trailer, the movie appears to have a lot of action, but during the film itself this is actually not the case, though the great story more than makes up for that, and keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie. There was no point, not even in some semi-romantic scenes, that I was distracted from the movie.<br/><br/>This is one of the few movies that IMO really really deserves a 10 all the way.

"LordElfstone","4","2","6","20 January 2007"," most overrated movie I have seen
","I didn't have the highest expectations for this movie, but I am surprised that it's worse than I would have imagined. It seems this movie can't decide whether it wants to have a message or just a mockery of that same message. I'm not familiar with the graphic novel this is based on, which means I can't tell if it's originally serious or humorous in tone. The movie, however, is neither serious nor funny, while trying to be both. Take the protagonist and the cop...the jokes don't work and often aren't appropriate. There is no acting for V to speak of, since he is more or less only voiced and the cop (Stephen Rea) is awfully wooden which makes about 90% of the - minimalistic - dialog pain to sit through. Many other characters are overdrawn in comparison - OK, it's based on a comic, but anyway - which doesn't work (for me).<br/><br/>The message comes across as pretentious, because the real issues are once again comically overdrawn - which is OK, since it's a graphic novel adaptation - but then again, there is completely serious stuff and both in one movie seems like trying to please everyone. There's a lot of dragging which probably only bothers you if you are not in love with this story...which I wasn't, needless to say.<br/><br/>Not to mention there are some plot holes and things that just don't make any sense, not even in a fictional world. One bigger fighting scene is - with good reason, of course - a Matrix homage, but a poor one. This did nothing for me, at all. <br/><br/>I'd have to say the movie is average, possibly falling below average if keeping in mind that I personally was tempted to turn it off more than once. Certainly not worth any awards in my book. I'm all for films that provoke thought. I don't need flashy action sequences in a comic adaptation. However, if everything fails to come together in a tight package, I'd rather go with brainless fighting and gore. This movie might have been quite entertaining with more action. The way it stands this is one of the biggest bores I had (while not honestly ""bad""). All the more reason to waste another 15 minutes to write this review...yeah, what can I say. It needs to be said. 5/10<br/><br/>Explanation to some of the criticism: <br/><br/>***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I can't think of a single joke that worked...starting with the awful V alliteration entrance of V...I guess that is a fan favorite and taken straight from the graphic novel. It felt out of place, he never did it again, which makes me all the more certain it was an egg for fans. All the remarks of the cop character fell flat. He was just plain boring. <br/><br/>The sample of the movie's present day population probably were supposed to serve the message, but it was one of the most pointless things in my opinion. The little girl was shot, then she was shown among the crowd in the end. Was it just a story that never happened? Or is the girl dead but still one of ""us""? I bet they would like us to discuss this, but what of it...I doubt it's worth the time spent.<br/><br/>The twist makes no sense...who were the people that entered Evey's cell? Puppets? Whatever. One of the worst twists I've ever seen.<br/><br/>What about the allusions that Gordon is V? Pointless. It's stuff like that which makes a movie ""pretentious"" in my book. Prime example.<br/><br/>Finally, the last and longest fighting sequence...Wachowski brothers spoofing themselves (or the director trying to be clever?). Haha, funny. No. This is supposed to be a little serious, right? But it kills a potentially good conclusion with the - extremely tired by now - isn't-this-a-cool-effect fighting scene, with not even that hot choreography, above that. Everything that follows, I don't know, my brain already turned off."

It worked on me. I didn't believe the film wouldn't be better than the trailer. I didn't believe my friends who disliked it. I was wrong.

"Mxzplk","5","2","6","10 November 2006"," V for Vanity, for Veracity, for Vicious, for Void, for Vulgar
","With V for Vendetta, the Wachowski brothers illustrate the presumptuous vanity, the lack of veracity, vicious, void-ly vague and vulgar ignorance that pop culture cultivates about the ""system"".<br/><br/>In one of the oldest James Bond films, at the end of the 70's, there is a delicious scene for the south American audience (there is resentment in this because i'm brazillian): 007 entered with his motor boat an Amazon river and, out of the blue, came out by the Iguaçu falls, at the border with Argentina. Except for the fun, it is like that as well that works out the reasoning of V for Vendetta - the starting point has no connections with the finishing line, and the path covered from one to the other is a mystery. Example: the masked V (Hugo Weaving), in solitary and secret fight against the totalitarian regime that dominates 2020's England, teach his pupil Evey (Natalie Portman) that men don't need buildings, but ideas. Where the hack, concludes him in a imaginary jump even more acrobatic then James Bond's boat, that blowing up the Parliament to smithereens will certainly make his ideas reach the mind of his fellow contemporaries? It is not even worth spending time and space arguing about a film with no manners where the hero is a terrorist carrying explosives. What calls attention in V for Vendetta are its stubborn ignorance and non-reflected affiliation to the thought of that the ""system"", whichever is, is corrupt and harmful.<br/><br/>Even more curious then V's logic, for example, is the person he imitates in clothes and mask: Guy Fawkes, a catholic that, in 1605, planned to decimate the protestant aristocracy by blowing up the Chamber of the Lords. Fawkes was discovered at the basement of the Parliament with 36 powder barrels and was hanged for it, providing to the English a joke similar to the threshing of Judas Iscariotes. Every 5th of November, date called Powder Conspiracy, Fawkes dolls are hanged and burned and fireworks pop up all over England. What, in 2006 or 2020, that somebody thinks Fawkes as an inspiring figure is intriguing. Four hundred years ago, the Parliament building was a symbol of absolutism. Today, in contrary, it represents another kind of ""system"", - the constitutionalism, and in one of the most successful versions. It is hard too to imagine that, in 2400, similarly 400 years from now, Americans will have fun as well threshing figures of Osama bin Laden. If Fawkes fits for the joke is because he didn't have the competence of his Saudi counterpart to commit mass murder. But well he tried. Great antidote his example could be, so, against the regime of permanent crisis instituted by the dictator and ""big brother"" Adam Sutler (a choice that the producers must have found the epitome of irony, interpreted by John Hurt, exactly the same protagonist and victim of the Big Brother in 1984).<br/><br/>The brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski, of Matrix, wrote and produced V for Vendetta (the direction was given to a subordinate of them, a certain James McTeigue), and answer for the most of the nonsense seen on screen. The idea didn't come from them though, but from the English graphic novel artist Alan Moore, an idol of the genre (that, by the way, demanded to not have any mention of his name on the credits of the film). Moore and illustrator David Lloyd started to publish the V for Vendetta series at the first mandate of Margaret Thatcher and finished at the third and last therm of the prime-minister. The V for Vendetta comics overflows the violence and violation feeling that a good amount of the British people had while crossing the thatcherist deconstruction - and breaths as well a little bit from the obscure. Certainly nobody would call Thatcher a sweet, but what she did wasn't concentrate the power of the State, but dried it, and stimulated the English (even with her peculiar cruelty) to take care of their own lives. The more the citizen depends financially on the State or from the decision-making point of view, the more s/he will be subject to kiss the hand that feeds it. Economical liberty is, thus, a requirement for other kind and more valued freedoms, such as political, social and of customs. The trick is, until today, the only environment that it flourished was the capitalist. And, even due to a culture matter and decades of marxism fantasy, is more common to see in capitalism a ""system"" destined to create and spread injustice then of a regulated system, in manners some time spontaneous, by mutual advantages and dependency. The pop culture - and V for Vendetta is a legitimate unit of it - prefers to assume that the system is all bad; if interested in a debate, it will maybe come to the uncomfortable verification that it doesn't have any alternatives to consider (bomb the Parliament or assassinate prime-ministers are not alternatives).<br/><br/>Happilly, not all States are like so impetuous to discussion, and some of them, even the English and the Scandinavian, developed efficient instruments to minimize the injustices that, yes, are of capitalist nature. And happily as well that not all film makers that approach this subject live so satisfied in their own ignorance like the Wachowski brothers. Removing some simplifications, films like Wall Street, The Constant Gardener, Syrianna, The Informer or even Robocop offers sagacious and pertinent opinions about the world they came from. One thing, however, they have in common with V for Vendetta: all of them, the good and the bad ones, were made the way the producers wanted them to be made, without the interference of States or governments. It is to try to repeat the same feat in Cuba or China to understand, at first hand, what really is to live under a totalitarian regime.<br/><br/>Just my two cents"
"faraaj-1","3","2","6","1 November 2006"," Fails on every level
","V for Vendetta is probably the worst film in the IMDb 250. It could even be the worst in the Top 1000. This film fails on every level and after watching it I'm amazed at peoples taste. V is full of clichés and frankly I could not find one redeeming aspect to this mess. Alan Moore - the creator of the comic character - disowned this film. Good for him! I never read the comic but I'm told it was quite good.<br/><br/>I'm stumped to list the problems with V because in order to criticize a movie, it needs to have a core, a treatment which you can disagree with. But V has no core, no structure, just a lot of pretensions and intellectual posturing without conviction. I've always liked Natalie Portman - see the amazing Leon - but she's the biggest joke of this film. Her accent is a mess and frankly she looks completely lost. For me, the entire film was a collage of ideas, scenes and themes from other movies. The resultant whole is direction-less, pointless and an embarrassment for the entire team that contributed to this rot."

","I've always been a fan of plot lines where an enigmatic masked man befriends a beautiful woman. Call it the hopeless romantic in me, but it's one of my favorites. The added bonus with this movie is the political overtones with religious zealot leaders who are determined to rule the world through fear and intimidation. Ever wonder why you always see religion followed by violence? This movie brilliantly shows how in times of desperation, we turn to any leader who's willing to come forth, and then become blind to his corruption. (sound familiar?) This movie also makes the conspiracy theory wheels turn in your mind. Does our government create disasters in order to gain political favor? Were some of our recent tragedies known about, or even worse, planned by our own government? V for Vendetta does exactly what it set out to do: get you thinking about political corruption, absolute power and religious abuse. Aside from the political message, there's also the romantic undertones. Mix some Phantom of the Opera with Beauty and the Beast and a dash of Stockholm Syndrome, then you've got the perfect pairing of Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman. The only downside to the movie is the sound. Because V is always wearing a mask, it's very hard to hear what he is saying. Have the volume at the ready. Otherwise, I loved this movie!"

","Did you see that movie, Mystery Men, about misfit superheroes a few years ago? It had one guy whose superpower was to get really really mad, and another who would fling forks. This ""V"" character is kind of like a cross between them  he's inconsolably angry, and he throws cutlery at people. Knives in this case.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't have so much in the way of superhero action, opting instead for pretentious dialog and devices like flashbacks and silly shots of dominos falling in slo-mo. So maybe it's a thinking movie? No  afraid not. The politics are callow, the villains are comically one-dimensional, and the hero has all the charisma of a Columbine punk. Unless you enjoy shallow, transparent attempts to elicit righteous anger on your part, you will find it boring and roll your eyes a lot. I know I did.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie  The Matrix is one of my all-time favorites. But where The Matrix is full of things that make you go ""Whoa!,"" this movie is full of things that make you go ""Whatever."""

","Yes, I read the book first, and had a long love affair with it. No, I am not merely spiting an inexact adaptation onto the big screen.<br/><br/>Viewed as a film without any knowledge of the source, V seems to be a competent action thriller with a slightly deeper hold on plot and character development than most others. However, even here, certain themes and repeated images lifted from the book are misused and partially presented, and to the uninitiated viewer stick out like sore thumbs. However, the cinematography was largely rather good, and there are a number of very solid performances, including Portman, who remains a good actress despite her rubbish English accent.<br/><br/>Viewed as an adaptation, V is an outright failure. By only having the slightest grasp on the reason for the events of the book and excising anything that could be seen as genuinely risky in favour of extreme, grotesque violence, the Wachowskis have essentially gutted this story of its power and meaning. Certainly, they made a lot of conscious decisions about changes they were making to the behaviour and backgrounds of the characters, and most likely with the best intentions. However, these choices uncover incongruities in the plot and result in a generally unconvincing portrayal of the dystopian England of the film, as well as its inhabitants. In addition, there are numerous unintentionally comic moments that betray an inability to escape from the overblown action-movie mentality that made the Wachowskis famous, including the world's least tactfully-filmed hanging at the very beginning.<br/><br/>The inclusion of verbatim moments from the book would normally be absolutely par for the course in an adaptation like this, but given the way in which the Wachowskis altered the fundamental motivations and philosophies of the story, they feel like a dumb movie ripping off the clever bits from a totally separate work. It would be easy to accept this on the level of a simple popcorn flick were it not for all the pretence of intellectual maturity that the Wachowskis ladled upon it, but were clearly not qualified to deliver on. I only hope it doesn't take too long for somebody else to have a slightly better-thought-out crack at this."

Britain is a mature democracy don't believe this guff. At the worst every now and then we read the daily mail and get worked up about immigration & paedophiles. To 'argue'  and this is a massively unsubtle polemic  that we would so easily be led down the road of fascism is both an insult to our capacity to think for ourselves and a distortion of the reality that the social changes /values this film seeks to defend and the war on terror it attacks have both been advanced by our current labour government (ok not true of the USA but the film isn't about USA).<br/><br/>Personally I think its dishonest and manipulative when writers try to shore up their own particular values & beliefs by trying to associate anything critical of those values / beliefs with a slide into totalitarianism & genocide. However they did get one thing right: in a country like Britain the only way you could achieve any kind of totalitarianism is through manipulation of the media. And exactly how conservative is the media in this country? I mean if you ask the question who exactly is controlling what we can and can't say, and therefore what we can and can't think well I'd say that honour belongs to the likes of the Warshawskis and the Islington set who made this film. So if you like being told what to think, and made what to feel, you'll enjoy this film and feel refreshed in your right-on credentials.

I had hight hopes on it, but soon as the ""shallow pretending to be deep"" script a la Matrix Reload and Revolutions began to show itself, I knew something was very wrong. So, I saw their names at the end credits, and I realized why I didn't like V. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I really like The Matrix (the 1st one), but I can't stand its sequels. And this ""V for Vendetta"" is nothing more than a crappy Matrix Revolutions remake in disguise of ""1984"" (they even got John Hurt in the role of ""Big Brother"" here...). The storytelling is so stupid, so full of clichés and absurd explanations (that when the things get explanations: for most of the happenings we are never shown why and how they happen) that it made me wish to have my time back before the movie ended. Oh, my, I can't believe that this movie got this high ratio...<br/><br/>OK, the movie is not total garbage: there are some good acting, nice photography, cool special effects. But the movie as a whole is way too pretentious for what it delivers (oh, the Wachowski trademark). It's no surprise that Alan Moore, author of the original graphic novel, demanded to get his name removed from the credits.<br/><br/>My suggestion: if you have a brain, watch the original ""1984"", a truly raw movie about dictatorship and oppression. Avoid this V crap!"
"tapkac2","2","2","6","25 May 2006"," I Clapped Loudly When V FINALLY Died (or What Was but What Did Never Be)
","When I go into a movie, especially a big-budget movie, I expect at least SOME plausibility, which means I expect to at least say ""Okay, it's baloney but I'll buy it for now since it's a MOVIE.<br/><br/>I haven't read the comic books, but I can totally understand why the creator would drop his name from this: It's SUPPOSED TO BE a George Orwell's ""1984"" type world where a seemingly faceless man stands against the tyranny and inspires the majority, who are as tired of it as ... say ... Irish and Northern Irish Catholics in the early 1900's were tired of being under British rule when Michael Collins (another seemingly faceless man for a while) came along. <br/><br/>ALL I SAW in this movie was that there was a curfew for the public and lies on the news. WOW! Really Oppressive! In Real Life, most of the shops close at about 10 or 11 so there's no reason to leave the house anyway (thus you have what is essentially a curfew) so WHERE'S THE OPPRESSION THERE? As far as Lies on the News are concerned, Oh Gee, you can STOP WATCHING TELEVISION! (I myself watch a total of only about 5 hours between Monday and Friday).<br/><br/>Of course, it is shown that there was some kind of genocide similar to the Holocaust that the government was hiding that The Public Doesn't Know About. COME ON! The government of a country that's hardly the size of South Carolina can HIDE THAT? I ask that rhetorical question because by this time, all The Public still knows is that there's a curfew, lies are on the news, and then one day, some guy wearing a mask of a historical character took over and said some wild things. Rush Limbaugh and Michael Moore say wild things too, so if they wear a mask of a famous revolutionary from the past, are you going to jump on one of their bandwagons That immediately and That militantly? If so, then why don't those who agree what I'm saying so far just finance my way to be elected President immediately after they read this review?<br/><br/>Oh, there's also the part where a girl wears the V costume with the (Oh my God, how much longer do we have to see this Jar-Jar Binks Level of Annoying face?) mask and gets shot and then the shooter gets what was coming to him. Now the General Public feel oppressed by curfew, lies on the news, and now a little girl getting shot, since they still know nothing of the genocide.<br/><br/>One day, V puts Natalie through her version/his ""Nice"" version of Hell by staging an imprisonment involving hair-shearing, a bit of starvation, and a few other things so he could make her have a better idea of who and why he is. During this, we have the unnecessary portion of the story where she finds the scrawled writings of some former lesbian couple that were imprisoned because of who they were. News Flash: Tolerance of anything or anyone (by the meaning of the word)is sitting next to a crying baby whose parent/s is burping longly and loudly after slurping a drink while eating the chicken or fish plate with the manners of a four year old! Please, Hollywood, stop trying to cram this ""politically correct"" junk down our throats!<br/><br/>Anyway, for some reason, the ALLEGEDLY Super Oppressive Government That Knows What You Eat for Breakfast doesn't catch on to one person sending lots of the same packages to all sorts of people. For some other reason, V, the Sender of the packages, knows exactly to whom and where the said packages are supposed to be sent since anyone living in such an ALLEGEDLY intrusive government will gladly give out their addresses through the ALLEGEDLY government-controlled channels, RIGHT? Back in 1996 (YES in the USA), I myself had to fill out a form telling the general idea of what I was sending in certain packages, and an ""Orwellian"" government isn't going to be more inquisitive? <br/><br/>I think I'll mention here that I love the irony that John Hurt plays the Chancellor of this ""Orwellian"" government after once playing the character Winston Smith, the main character who is a victim of the same kind of government in George Orwell's ""1984"". <br/><br/>Second-to-Final Insult: THOUSANDS of people, who still have problems ONLY with curfews and still haven't learned how to turn off the television, ALL put on the costumes that were sent to them by some weirdo who thought he was the Second Coming of Anyone on TV. During this, the Still ALLEGEDLY Super Oppressive Government That Knows Your Favorite Sleeping Position STILL knew NOTHING of what to do.<br/><br/>The FINAL INSULT: Seemingly everyone is not only overjoyed that the Guy in Charge is gone, but the Whole Idea of Any Kind of Government is BLOWN UP by bombing the buildings. Wow, that reminds me of any rhetoric you'll hear from anyone at least involved with suicide bombers, hijackers/skyjackers, or any kind of terrorist.<br/><br/>This brings me to what was going to be my original review title: <br/><br/>""V for Vendetta: A Movie That Cheerleads The Terrors of 9/11"". <br/><br/>As I said in the headlines and in the first paragraphs, it's SUPPOSED TO BE a movie about oppressed people who've had enough and finally one guy opens the floodgates. WHAT I SAW was a NON-oppressed public that jumps on the bandwagon of some guy in a Hallowe'en costume quicker than you can say your name. In other words, I GET IT. It's just done in a very weak way.<br/><br/>Just to be fair, I'll give this movie a second look.<br/><br/>AAaannd, CUT! That's a wrap."

","Set in a Britain of the not too distant future, a lone terrorist, V, seeks to lead the public in overthrowing Sutler, their repressive dictator.<br/><br/>Struggling to emerge is a very good film, but any potential is swallowed by its incoherent thematic pretensions. A high-quality cerebral action film can only be beneficial to the industry, paving the way for studios to allow more genuine artists to create worthwhile films and make their profits. This dual purpose of intelligence with mass appeal does not work for V for Vendetta. Whereas with The Matrix the audience could take or leave the cod-philosophy and still have an essence of what the film was about, V for Vendetta demands the audience's participation for both aspects. This would be a welcomed but there is not a great deal to be gained from this approach. Take this just as an action film with long words and you will be left with a series of fights and explosions, which admittedly is what some want, but most will feel empty. The alternative approach is equally troublesome  try to figure out what the dubious symbolism and paradoxes mean and all that remains of the film is a patchwork of half-ideas that detracts from some spectacular set pieces. Herein lies the conundrum which doesn't seems to have a solution, leaving an overriding feeling that the Wachowskis in their script and McTeigue in his direction are so convinced that they are being clever that they neglect to allow any of their ideas to form into anything meaningful.<br/><br/>V's mask is initially irritating, but as you get used to it James Purefoy's actions and Wachowski favourite Hugo Weaving's speech emerge into the best performance of the film, with subtlety of voice and gesture combining to make V at least somewhat convincing as a character. Stephen Fry somehow manages to play an intelligent, gay man with an appreciation for the finer things in life who is no stranger to appearing on television. It is a shame that Fry, who is defined by being so intelligent, cannot bring himself to play characters that might stretch him as an actor. Natalie Portman and her accent both prove insufficient in bringing the necessary gravity and credence to Evey. This is disappointing from one who has established her credentials as an effective actress and with better direction would have been capable of delivering a worthy performance.<br/><br/>The Wachowski's films do have a ring of Kubrik about them. This will be sacrilege for many, but there are a few good reasons. Each had a liking for grandiose messages, each had a fascination with authority and finally each had decidedly mixed reviews when their films were released. The vital difference of course is that Kubrik was a far superior filmmaker and thus in comparison to such genius it can be seen why V for Vendetta appears so empty - because it is. It lacks the directorial judgement between the need for overt and subtle, and crucially the ability to present vicious dissent without descending into incoherent rant.<br/><br/>The Wachowskis and McTeigue steer clear of presenting too direct and simple a message, but in so doing swing too far the other way, heaping on the paradoxes and meaningful glances. What results is not much more than a two-hour version of the Architect's speech from Matrix Reloaded, punctuated by action that is, in the main, inferior to the team's previous work. All in all, a decidedly mediocre film."

I hear the steak sizzling but where's the meat? High praise should be reserved for the truly clever and original. The most dangerous aspect of this movie is that it's a ""wolf in sheep's clothing"": by making simplistic, paranoiac statements to an audience that expecting an action movie, they're more likely to make an impression--and it has.

","I give the movie V for Vendetta a 6/10. It was okay but it's not top notch or superb. I will say that I like the message the movie is trying to send, I like the direction it's trying to go. An oppressing world controlled by the government and here comes along a man, V, who has the will to stand up to them. The director tried to go for something more profound but I think the movie fell short of that. V for Vendetta is a movie that is easily commercial but tries goes for the more profound spectrum of commercial; that I give some credit. In the end it's a movie that you kind of like but it's nothing much to offer in the end.<br/><br/>The acting was okay, nothing exceptional (not that I was expecting anything more or anything less). The guy who played V, Hugo Weaving, tried to be a man of thought and a man of ideas but I felt he did not execute the role as well as it should've been. The message he was trying to send was mostly blurred by the tone of his voice. He was trying to hard to be this man of influence. If he could ease the accent a little more, then it might have been executed better. Natalie Portman did the best she could, better than I thought she would. However, her acting did not suit this moviein a way it hindered it because she was far too weak for this role. I thought it was a good choice in the ending to not reveal V's face, because of that it provided more leverage to the movie.<br/><br/>One of the scenes I like in the movie was when all the citizens are marching in masses wearing the V mask. That was a good scene. However, the ending was quite weak. It was trying to portray that blowing up parliament was the solution to everything. Practically the last portion of the movie came down to that moment. One can make the argument that it was symbolic, but the impressions that I got was that it was trying to glamorize blowing up the building. The ending fell short. Anyone who knows how politics work knows that blowing the parliament building was anything but the end. Anyone who knows about politics knows that blowing up the parliament building was just the beginning of something greater. The ending would have been more effective had the movie elaborated more on that. It was like ""okay the building is blown up to smithereens now it's over. The End."" Instead, Evey says she will never forget V and she will never forget Nov. the 5th . something of that nature. I like in the beginning it starts out talking about ideology being something you cannot taste something you cannot defeatsomething of that nature. But the ending was more about remembering a man and a particular day than what he STOOD for and his IDEAS. It would have been nice if the end had been not just about a man or a particular day, but on a more larger scale. I credit the writer for adding more layers to V, making him more human in his actions. Despite that, the movie glamorizes V rather than his ideas.that's why it's a commercial movie. This movie has very good ideas and a good sense of direction but did not execute. V for Vendetta is a movie I would generalize for teenies and young adults. A movie for entertainment.<br/><br/>ON ANOTHER NOTE: I heard this was a movie controversial but going into the movie I did not see anything controversial nor did I associate the movie with the U.S. at all. I saw absolutely nothing controversial about it until I came to this site and heard people compare this movie to the U.S government. I can now see why people are comparing VfV to the U.S society as an ""eye opener."" Whiter or not that is the intentions of this movie, throughout the time while watching the movie that did not even cross my mind. Others' have rated this movie according to the disliking of a particular government. My review has nothing to do with politics, nor government associations, nor my political stance. My review is SPECIFICALLY based on the movie itself, nothing else."

","Brilliant as a movie, Poor as an adaption. No that is not entirely correct. Cinematicaly V was done brilliantly. The imagery, mood and sound throughout the flick was done with an artists touch and from fight scenes through to dramatic moments of personal interaction you get a feeling of looking at a canvas per frame.<br/><br/>That said..... As to how it works as a screen adaption of the greatest single literary work I have ever read? The director was sometimes perfectly spot on in ways that made me see frames from the story placed on celluloid and at other time million miles from the truth. I know in pretty much all movie adaptations of books and graphic novels there is always(though often I cant understand why) a change from the original story line. Unfortunately these changes were extraordinary. <br/><br/>The whole mood of the graphic novel was lost to a city where show girls were seen on television, where normal television stations existed. In the graphic novel there is no private television or radio. All you have is the Voice day in day out telling you that you are being watched there is no TV shows, action, drama or otherwise. This is a totalitarian state in the worst sense. People have no freedom, none.<br/><br/>Changing Eve's occupation is a major flaw because they change the person she is. The ""joke"" television scene. What is that? That is so far from the graphic novel as to be ludicrous. Why change V's conversation with Lady Justice. I would have put that to screen exactly as it was in the graphic novel, exactly, minus the girl.<br/><br/>While watching the movie from the opening scenes and V's verbal run I had to keep on reminding myself to watch it as a stand alone and not bring the graphic novel into it. Unfortunately thats hard when in some scenes the movie is poetically perfectly spot on. The prison cell scene left me breathless and then the producers and directors lose the plot on a large part of the movie.<br/><br/>To end I have to say that I was left feeling that the movie was made ""friendly"" kid friendly, parent friendly average Joe friendly. Unfortuanetaly this is not a friendly story changing the girl from being a prostitute to being a office worker does not do Alan Moores work justice and even though I don't know why he chose to remove his name from the movie, after the producers ask him to put his OK on it, I'm not surprised he chose to not associate himself with this sometimes brilliant sometimes poor ""adaption"" of a master piece in writing.<br/><br/>PS Three things. Why put the banana peel in the story and not tell the proper story of the banana peel? The girl with the glasses?

One being the recollection of a nurse involved in the extermination of a group of what the Govt. considered undesirable people. And the explosions... yeah ... they look good on a big screen.<br/><br/>But, what I came here for was a good story. This movie tries to throw serious subject matter of a Govt. killing there own citizens for control by fear. The Govt. officials also make a killing on antibiotics they sell to citizens trying to save their lives from the avian flu that was purposely released.<br/><br/>The problem with the story is it goes off on lunatic tangents of inconsequential story lines that are treated in the utmost ridiculous fashion. A Catholic priest about to molest a dolled up Natalie Portman for example? The movie is based on a comic book, so I am not asking for a serious drama. But this film wants to be both drama and action. Unfortunately the action scenes consist of nothing more than the character V standing in a circle of thugs, then killing them with knives. When you compare the excellent Batman Begins, you will be sorely disappointed of this film that claims to offer serious melding of drama in a dark comic world.

"mark-1224","7","2","6","25 March 2006"," An attempt shouldn't even have been made
","Shock horror a review that doesn't give this 10 out of 10. So why? Well, first things first; any type of mask blocks out any emotional expressions, obviously. So it is hard for any actor, even the magnificent Hugo Weaving, to pull of a character well when he can't display his emotion. Multiply the difficulty of his job of expressing emotion by one hundred when the mask is constantly grinning...cheesely.<br/><br/>This is the main reason why 'V for Vendetta' is a poor film. It should never have been attempted on celluloid in the first place. It works on a comic book simply because there aren't long-winded dialogue scenes where the camera cuts back from Evey (Portman) to the smiling anti-hero who is meant sad, angry, in love, etc. etc. And these dialogue scenes make up the large majority of the film, accompanied by less painful but equally laborious scenes of the London bobbies trying to work out who V is (which they do not do well at). You see this would have been one of the few films that would have been better had it been 90% action and 10% chit-chat because in the action scenes the mask does work and he looks almost 'cool' (if he has the hat on to detract from his stupid hair style, without it he looks like a rampaging hormonal goth).<br/><br/>However there is some good in 'V', the little action that is there does just about work, the story wasn't translated to an American setting which was brave of the studios and the torture scene of Evey is well done, though it is then thrown out the window for reasons I will not disclose to prevent spoilers.<br/><br/>The thing is that by the end of 'V' your tired of the boring speeches, tired of the long-winded story and fed up it trying to be a 'clever movie' by adding the odd quote in from MacBeth and other works of literature.<br/><br/>It probably looked good on paper (apart from the constant repetition of the word 'b*llocks' that apparently Brits use as frequently as they do where bowler hats and have handle-bar moustaches) it just doesn't work on film."

This movie is a classic example of a superb story being befuddled in the hands of less-talented individuals. Nearly everything that made the comic great was dumbed-down or crapped all over. Even the lighting and angles chosen seemed overly amateur and did nothing to convey the dark feeling of a totalitarian state. And, without ruining the ending, I will say that the Wachowski jerks totally missed the entire point of the graphic novel.<br/><br/>The annoying thing is that it could have made such a good movie, in the hands of more approving fans. Or, at the very least, a great action movie. Instead we get boring, watered-down plot and confusing character development. I'm starting to believe the rumours about the Wachowski bros. stealing the Matrix script--how could the writers of that movie make such a hulking pile of ""bullocks"" like this?! <br/><br/>Alan Moore, the author of the far superior comic, asked for his name to be removed from the credits (the end credits say: based on the graphic novel ILLUSTRATED by David Lloyd). He also called the screenplay childish, which I believe is absolutely right. The graphic novel, V for Vendetta will be remembered for years as a classic piece of literature, this stain on it's name will hopefully be forgotten by the next election year."

","I was a little disappointed in this movie. I loved the Matrix, written by the same brothers. If you go to the movies every week, it's worth seeing compared to what's out there. But if like me, you can only slip enough time in for the big ones....wait for the video on this one.<br/><br/>Great fight scenes. Interesting story line. Intriguing supporting characters. Natalie Portman's character is genuine and well portrayed. The only character that left me feeling empty was the main character, the radical, political reformist known only as ""V."" As much as the writers tried to define him, you're never left with the impression of humanity. Perhaps that was what they were striving for and just missed the fine line between that and a stock character.<br/><br/>However, the Wachowski brothers' clever way with a plot will still entertain you and it is still a worthy rental."

","This is not a review of the movie... It is a 10 and any direct comment on it might end up change your point of view. So I thought I'd comment on the notion that this movie is ""anti-American"" or anti-democratic.<br/><br/>It amazes me how, as Americans, we can be so self-righteous and patriotic about our independent rebellious nature and yet condemn this movie. This movie is about fighting totalitarianism, fascism, and in defense of fundamental rights. Replace the homosexual references with Jews and the fascist government with Nazi Germany and this movie would have been unquestionably received as truly American in the late 1940's and early 1950's. The following is a US history timeline that should not be forgotten:<br/><br/>1770 - Boston Massacre: British troops sent to Boston to maintain order and to enforce the Townshend Acts. The troops, constantly tormented by ""gangs"", finally (Mar. 5, 1770) fired into a rioting crowd and killed five menthree on the spot, two of wounds later. The funeral of the victims was the occasion for a great patriot demonstration. (BTW - John Adams represented the defense for the British Capt. Thomas Preston)<br/><br/>1773 - Boston Tea Party: A group of indignant colonists, led by Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and others, disguised themselves as Native Americans, boarded merchant ships on the night of Dec. 16, 1773, and dumped forty-five tons of tea into the Boston Harbor. (Today's commercial value of tea is about $1/oz... 16 oz in a lb... 2000 lbs in a short ton... So the ""Sons of Liberty"" dumped over $1.44 million worth of tea.)<br/><br/>1775 - Lexington & Concord: The Boston British commander, Gen. Thomas Gage, wanted to avoid armed rebellion. He sent a column of royal infantry from Boston to capture colonial military stores at Concord. When Major John Pitcairn's infantry reached Lexington, they came upon a group of militia (the Minutemen). The initial armed standoff quickly turned violent. After a brief exchange of shots in which several Americans were killed, the colonials (Minutemen) withdrew, and the British continued to Concord. Upon return to Boston, the British infantry was harried by the Minutemen in a manner considered uncivilized. The Minutemen attacked from behind trees and rocks and then broke off the attack before the British infantry could rally.<br/><br/>Other actions taken on by revolutionaries against opposition - Loyalist or Tories (especially government officials) were tarred and feather, homes were vandalized, burned in effigy, threatened, harassed and ridiculed.<br/><br/>How about some famous American quotes:<br/><br/>*No taxation without representation *Live free or die *Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death! <br/><br/><ul><li>Patrick Henry *I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man. - Jefferson *Revolution was effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people . . . . This radical change in the principles, opinions, sentiments, and affections of the people was the real American Revolution. - John Adams *Don't interfere with anything in the Constitution. That must be maintained, for it is the only safeguard of our liberties. - Lincoln *Fear is the foundation of most governments; but it is so sordid and brutal a passion, and renders men in whose breasts it predominates so stupid and miserable, that Americans will not be likely to approve of any political institution which is founded on it. - John Adams *Those who deny freedom to others, deserve it not for themselves; and, under a just God, can not long retain it. - Lincoln *The liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be, secure, when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them. - Patrick Henry *I regret that I have but one life to give for my country. -Nathan Hale, hung as a spy by the British at the age of twenty one, Sept. 21, 1776 *Necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of tyrants; it is the creed of slaves. - William Pitt, English Prime Minister - Nov. 18, 1783</li></ul>"

","Excellent work from all involved. Being a fan of all 3 Matrix movies, (no thats not a typo) I obviously had this movie in my sights for quite a while. It captures everything the Wachowski's crew does well, and leaves what they do not do well pretty much out of sight here. The Effects are seamless, the acting is superb, the story is powerful. The picture starts like many other super hero/comic movies start off. Damsel in distress gets saved from being attacked, robbed and raped by said superhero. After this scene, it becomes something else, something different, which is what the Wachowski's crew is so good at. The Matrix was like something we have never seen before, and V for Vendetta is no different. Hugo Weaving gives as wonderful a performance though his face is concealed he uses his mannerisms, voice, and body language to do his acting for him. Portman buries her work from Closer and gives maybe the performance of her career. Go see it, you wont be disappointed.<br/><br/>FCT"
"erikpolano","9","2","6","20 March 2006"," One of the most spectacular and unique films of recent years
","""V for Vendetta"" is probably one of the most unique and enjoyable films I have seen in a long time. I just recently read ""1984"" and the amount of references to that and other events or works of literature is just remarkable. The Wachowski brothers have definitely proved themselves capable in the past and this once again shows that they are the best screenplay writers in Hollywood along with with Charlie Kaufman; though saying which one is better is like comparing apples and oranges. All credit cannot go to them though due to the fact that the story is taken from a graphic novel of the same name by David Lloyd. Hugo Weaving's acting skills, which where, in my eyes, in some doubt after having heard the line ""Mr. Anderson, welcome back"" one thousand times too many, truly shine and I no longer have doubts about him. Natalie Portman continues to show her high standard of acting which earned her praise in such films as ""Closer"" and this film shows her ability to carry a film as its protagonist. On a side note, some people may be interested to know that this movie has a mainly British cast: something nice and different for once for a movie like this one. The amount of symbols and references to events in the movie just make the movie more enjoyable. There is everything from Hitler and his rise to power seen in the evil dictator Adam Sutler to a conspiracy involving Bird Flu and the attempt to find a cure (with shots that seem very similar to holocaust movies involving corpses). On a an ending note, the main reason why many people would probably go and see the movie is for its special effects and, in all honesty, I can say that they won't go home disappointed even if the movie has more content than some may have expected it to."

","I really liked this movie for a number of reasons but mainly because of the writing. Bravo to the writers, everything that was said in the movie was touching. There were some odd scenes of humor but they played into the characters personality and it worked. I think people should see this movie not only for the action but more so for what it makes you think. Its amazing a movie that makes you think and you enjoy the bombing sequences all at the same time! I think viewers will like the similarities of our time now and the time suggested in the movie. The movie places the characters in a time where there rights as citizens and human beings is being taken away in the name of fear. It parrells to societies that we see now, i.e. some middle eastern countries, us, Bosnia, etc... People should have a discussion about the political phenomenon in this movie and hopefully will enlighten the individuals in the discussion."

","Heres a recipe for you: Take 2 cups Boondock Saints, and brown thoroughly Add 1 can of Matrix style, let simmer Spice with a little Shakespeare Pour over a hot bed of 1984 Garnish with just a touch of Phantom of the Opera Serve on the 5th of November<br/><br/>The dish you've prepared is a lovely little number called V for Vendetta. Now, perhaps I'm a bit biased, but when I see a dual knife wielding assassin/terrorist with a penchant for quoting Shakespeare and wearing a grinning trickster-esqe mask, well, I'm gonna be won over. This is truly a great step forward for the Wachowski brothers, who may actually remove the stigmas of Reloaded and Revolutions with this amazing film.(PS for you Matrix fans: There's a little bullet-time in there for ya!)<br/><br/>Of particular note is Hugo Weaving's performance, as he somehow combines the right levels of vengeance, Shakespearian pomp, and philosophical depth into a believable character, all without taking off that mask! The beauty of this film is while it doesn't run long, it feels like it does, but myself I didn't care, because I personally never wanted it to end.<br/><br/>BE CAREFUL THOUGH: If you're a Pat Robertsen or Bill O'Reilly kind of person, you may not be able to understand whats wrong with the government. Anyone else, however, shouldn't have that problem. <br/><br/>This is a movie that one shouldn't miss, and in this post 9-11 world, its refreshing to see that some people can still see opposing the government as heroic. FINAL GRADE: C (for you O'Reilly-ites), A for everyone else, A+ if you happen to think like me!"
"kristy-hwang","9","2","6","19 March 2006"," George Orwell's 1984...?
","I loved this movie! It had many parallels with George Orwell's 1984. There were also a lot of symbolism, especially integrating color and elements such as fire and water. V for Vendetta criticizes the totalitarian government of Britain, and although this may be understood as a direct attack against current events happening in the US or Middle East, I think the underlying theme of V for Vendetta is to capture the strength and resiliency of ideals such as freedom and justice (for which V is fighting for), as well as that of the human condition. <br/><br/>In regards to the characters, Natalie Portman is astounding in the portrayal of Evey as she goes through the process of self-identification and comes to an understanding of her place in her society. There are many parallels between her growth and V's growth, as they both undergo a mental breakdown of their understanding of reality, and emerge resolute and determined to fight for the causes they believe in. Their purification (under fire and water respectively) symbolize the completion of their journey in conquering fear - fear that drives people to think they are weak. I found that the most poignant moment in the film was when Evey comes out of the cell free and realizes everything was not what it seemed. When she breaks down crying, she portrays all the emotions of shock, disbelief, betrayal, strength and resolution as she comes to an understanding of her transformation. Also, by characterizing V as an intellectual, literary, well-learned and compassionate figure, his acts of terrorism are portrayed in less of a sadistic way. This still begs the question of whether his means are justified for his end, as the ending of the movie seems to implicitly suggest that it is. <br/><br/>Overall, I find this movie to be empowering in an intellectual sense because it portrays the fight for freedom as one that is not merely based on bombing/killing those who stand against it, but calls for a collective stance against injustice and oppression by reminding us of the power of what our voice can be used for."
"cofemug","8","2","6","19 March 2006"," P for Provoking
","V for Vendetta (2006); Dir: James McTeigue <br/><br/>Remember Remember the Fifth of November"" is much like ""Remember the Alamo,"" but, in V For Vendetta, the British rhyme is used more like Fox News Channel's constant recalling of 9/11. And, why not, as V For Vendetta has been rewritten to boldly extend the current state of the United States, and question our leadership and media coverage.<br/><br/>If V For Vendetta makes you a bit uncomfortable in its heroic bombing of landmarks, it may have done part of its job. But, is the audience ready for a call to rebellion yet? V For Vendetta opens with a theatricality which cuts in and out of the movie, as you see Evey (Natalie Portman) getting ready for a date with Gordon Deitrich (Stephen Fry), while V dons his Phantom of the Opera mask to go out for the night. As Evey is caught after curfew and about to be molested by roaming bands of government-hired enforcers, V swoops in and rescues her from her fate. V takes the saved heroine to a rooftop to watch his late-night demolition of Old Bailey, a British landmark.<br/><br/>Naturally, the national news station has a field day with the story. But, V takes the Government news station hostage to send his own message that in a year, there will be a revolution.<br/><br/>You see, in this futuristic world, the British government has been taken over by a Hitler-style government leader, Adam Sutler (John Hurt) who has been broadly painted to look like Hitler and George W. Bush. It becomes at once a tale of ""What would happen if the Third Reich had become the one remaining world power"" and ""What the US as the Third Reich would do."" In addition to painting Sutler equally like George W. Bush and Hitler, it also takes jabs at America and her penchant for starting wars, citing this as a leading cause of the Sutler rise to power.<br/><br/>If the movie seems a bit confused to what it is, its probably because it tried to chew a little too much off. It at once attempts to be a combination of blockbuster action, fantasy, superhero comic book, science-fiction parable, and fairy tale. It also is, at once, Orwell's 1984 with the theatricality of The Phantom of the Opera, with a bit of Farenheit 451 thrown in for good measure. On top of all this, it becomes an indictment of America, American government, by creating its downfall, and creating an uprising resembling our current leader.<br/><br/>V For Vendetta is a very ambitious movie for a first-time director, and its easy to tell where the Wachowski's stepped in on his style. Considering James McTeigue worked as first assistant director on all three Matrix movies, and the Wachowski brothers wrote the script for V For Vendetta, it is challenging not to make comparisons to the former movies. The Wachowskis made The Matrix by deftly weaving armchair philosophy, martial arts, science-fiction, neo-noir, and blockbuster action into a fluid cinematic tapestry the likes of which had not been seen before. Since they wrote the screenplay for V For Vendetta, and produced it, it is hard to say where their participation ended, but they were trying for a deftly woven fabric here as well.<br/><br/>However, McTeigue may not have been up to the task. McTiegue's visual sensibilities are rather meager, and his cinematic language not deep enough to keep the movie into a single flowing unit. With a few gorgeously made sets, and the occasional brilliant frame, V For Vendetta is its own worst nightmare, as it shows brilliance in the portions of what could have been. More than a few different portions of the movie were flat and seemed rather pedestrian in the visual choice.<br/><br/>But, the real star of the movie was not the visuals, it was the screenplay and the ideas behind it. Essentially, the Wachowski Brothers made a call to action for the ousting of our President, if not the restarting of the American government. Don't kid yourselves viewers, the transfer to Britain was mainly used as a white rabbit, and to keep the Guy Fawkes mask (who is not known by the American populace). The script goes from idea to idea, sometimes fully exploring one or two, and having a decent fixation on the plight of the homosexual.<br/><br/>But, whether or not the audience is ready to see terrorist bombings used heroically is a challenge. Not only is it a challenge due to the fact that bombings are nasty things, it is a challenge as we associate bombings with the evil Middle Eastern Religious Fanatics. It raises the question, do those terrorists have a point to their bombings? Are they trying to get out from under the foot of an oppressive government? I think that, which I find happenstance, the movie comes out on the same weekend as Operation Swarmer makes an interesting comment on how we should be questioning our government.<br/><br/>So, is the movie good? It depends on why you go to the movies. If you go to the movies for an easy action movie, you may have come to the wrong place. If you're looking for eye candy, there's been better. If you don't mind having your mind provoked, this is the best place to be.<br/><br/>B+"

","I was originally attracted to this movie because of the fact that the Wachowski brothers were involved. Surprisingly, you'll find that it contained the good elements of the Matrix trilogy, and a set of new ones mixed in. There's just the right amount of suspense, to where you aren't becoming uncomfortable, but it keeps you interested. The ending is fairly good, especially relative to the endings of most movies like it. If you watch movies for mindless entertainment, this is probably not the movie for you. There's enough action to satisfy most people, and the plot is one of the best I've seen in a very long time. I'm considering seeing it once more in the theater because of all the thought involved. You're constantly thinking, putting things together, understanding the events and their meanings, so you miss a little bit of the unimportant things. I enjoyed how there was very little of the cheesy, and predictable things every movie viewer has seen many times before. The sound is good, the dialogue is easily heard, and the visuals are great. Overall, it's a wonderfully written movie, possibly a must-see."

"evil17_ayi","10","2","6","18 March 2006"," Don't just discard this, read it!
","Before you go counting this as some crazy Liberal rabble, take some time and read it. I am giving this movie a ten simple to bring its overall average up, I do not believe it was a perfect ten but at least an 8 or a 9. The basic complaint everyone has is its "" Radical Political views"" the problem with this complaint is that we live in a country where Bush and his administration stage terrorist attacks to rally the people into war, a war which is only happening so that the corporations ( Carlyle Group, Halliburton, Wal-Mart, etc ) can make money raping another country like we tried to do to Cuba in the 60's. I know this must be a little over some peoples head, but that's only because the American people fail to do the research, America fails to turn off the television and radio and get in the library and on the internet ( the only free press left ) they fail to find out about their own government burning classified documents in the national libraries, or that the Bush AND Bin Laden Family are majority stock holders in the Carlyle Group ( which provide united defense for the nation, meaning anytime we go to war, Osama gets money ) people fail to realize that for centuries the Catholic Church has endorsed Sexual atrocities of every kind, and that Racial discrimination, and that of Homosexual's is stronger now then ever. People fail to realize the hidden clause in the ""No Child Left Behind Act"" which, unless parents sign their names on a slip of paper, the military can call and harass your children and try to get them to enlist, or that the new Patriot Act holds things in which the former did not. More chances for our beloved Government to spy on us and bend us over. Conservatives don't want to see this move because they do not want to be forced to see what they support, a Government which will develop ( if not checked ) into a Nazi regime. The whole point of this movie and a thousand other ones ( The Constant Gardener, Good night and good Luck, Syriana, JFK, etc ) is to make you question the system, which people rarely do. This film just makes its points more obvious while the previous thought America could pick out its meanings. Bashing Homosexuals is still discrimination, just like Bashing an African American or a Jewish American. Molesting little boys is wrong, and the catholic church has had about at least 20 different popes in the history rape, kill, and torture men, women and children. ( look it up ). The point of all this is to say this, Bush is not defending our freedoms, he is however, Taking them away, slowly but surely, and it is when you allow Media networks like fox news and bill o'Reilly to fill your head with garbage that you also subsequently allow the Government to make you their puppet. A Terrorist is someone who expresses their Political agenda through acts of violence. This word, Terrorist has taken new meaning with the break of 9/11, the GOV tried to blame it on Osama first, then Saddam, then back to Osama. Well here is the truth which the new media will not tell you and America is too lazy to look up, Osama has been under our employment since the cold war when we used ( and trained ) his army of Taliban Radicals to fight the soviets in Afghanistan, ( remember Rambo 3? ) since then we have used him to instigate conflicts across the world, to spark civil wars and revolutions. He is what is called a Black ops Agent. Its sad but true. The fight between Liberals and Conservatives is not about your political agenda or what the president is doing, it's the fight for education. Conservatives refuse to educate themselves and fight to stay in a controlled environment while the Liberals want change and question authority. The only way to end this battle is to wake up and get educated. Facts cannot be disputed like Lies can, Educate yourselves and the fighting will stop. Until then enemies will be enemies and debates will rage on."

"fightnomoreforever","9","2","6","17 March 2006"," A voyage of action and romance set in a futuristic background of fantasy
","""V for Vendetta"" is a swashbuckling tale in the stead of Zorro (who, as V would say, wears a mask through no coincidence) and ""The Three Musketeers"". This isn't a group of fairy tale scriptwriters, though, as the Wachowski brothers bring their unique talents to the table -- which, impressive as they are, still have a few faults along the way.<br/><br/>The movie opens with our protagonist, Evey (Natalie Portman) in narrative form, voicing the words, ""Remember, remember, the 5th of November."" The ominous poem continues, and it doesn't take long before we are swept into the embrace of a tale from a desperate act in a distant past. We then fast-forward to the near-future England, where the populace has tight restrictions on available freedoms, and the news media is a mere pawn of a government that's obviously a little too satisfied with how much power it wields. Through a tedious situation, Evey meets V(Hugo Weaving), a man who knows how to use not only daggers, but is a master of charisma as well. His introduction to the audience is thusly two-fold: A swift, superb action sequence followed by an assault of alliteration. It is a combo that appeals to the warriors, poets, and warrior-poets in us all, and lays the foundation for a highly likable character punctuated all the more by the fact that he seems a cross-dresser between the Phantom from ""The Phantom of the Opera"", the Ghost-killer from ""Scream"", and perhaps a little bit of the creepy Burger King ""King"" all wrapped into one.<br/><br/>While his wardrobe may be quirky and slightly alluring, his character is quickly expressed as a deadly serious one. If the eloquence of his speech isn't enough to draw the audience to him, his passion and unswerving idealism will most likely do the trick. Weaving does a magnificent job of bringing the man behind the mask to life, giving him a full range of human emotions, all while behind the grinning visage of V's mask. While many movies may strive to offer up just one or two poignant moments, often failing, Weaving commands a full ensemble of them solely by his ability to portray a man who's both larger than life and yet has moments of indecision and even self-doubt. This is a movie enriched by good acting, but it is V's show, after all, and he steals it in grandiose fashion.<br/><br/>Weaving's performance isn't an enigma here, either. Playing Evey, Portman also crafts a multi-faceted persona, with deep layers of personality and ambition. Watching the journey her character makes through the picture evokes a myriad of emotions from the spectators. From the opening scene fraught with fear and a loss of control, to the breakthrough she makes a few moments before the climax, whereby she undergoes transformations we can not only perceive by her body language and inflection, but by a certain shaving off her hair as well. Portman expertly shifts the elements of her milieu, and the result is a stark, grounded effort that manages to avoid being tawdry, even in the climactic moments of the film. Stephen Rea plays a solid, if unspectacular role in detective Finch, a good cop caught in a situation of questioning one's own allegiances, while Stephen Fry makes a great contribution as a late-night talk-show host. Fry is extremely likable in this role, serving as the comedy relief. But even his character is not limited to this capacity, and stakes his ideals against those of Adam Sutler (John Hurt), the totalitarian dictator who's mouth you'll be used to staring at by the end of the film. Hurt supplies his role succinctly, and while being limited to a few scenes, doesn't seem overacted or out of place.<br/><br/>We can assume this movie might have been fine without the Wachowski brothers. It could still have many great sequences and a thought-sparking plot, sprinkled with emotion and brimming with potential. Under the direction of the Wachowski brothers, this movie soars with fight scenes are as memorable and incredibly entertaining as they are different from the Matrix. Yes, the same background tale is here, a corrupted group of individuals who have total control on everything, and a few people trying to fight the machine and save humanity, but ""Vendetta"" has more than enough merit to be considered a triumph, rather than feeling like a rehashed tale. The plot is fresh and delicious, revolving around a -potential- love story between our hero and heroine, the overarching calamity of human suffering and death, and mixed in with moments both funny and inspiring. Sadly, the brothers also club the plot over the head at times with predictability, though a few instances are totally surprising. The classic orchestral soundtrack, composed by Owen Paterson, is explosive and exquisite and serves to heighten the tension as well as the sense of grandeur in all the right moments.<br/><br/>""Vendetta"" does weave a deft plot though, with extremely strong characters that seem to border on the edge of the fantastic. It is the style, the bravado, of ""Vendetta"" that creates a sense of wonder in those who choose to experience it. While a plot of fantasy may seem out of place in the near future, it blends extremely well here, giving a visual beauty to the film with a rich sense of purpose and theme. This movie conveys an astute self-awareness and attention to detail that sets it apart from the special effects ridden chaos that is today's Hollywood landscape. Even the effects seem to be torn from a page of V's heart, even as sparsely used as they are. This movie is one huge cohesive effort, and while it feels a bit too chimerical in places, it explodes (literally) with success in others.<br/><br/>Vendetta does what many movies try to do -- entertain the audience while simultaneously impressing upon them a sense of importance, and accomplishes this act very well."

If you're outside our borders and fear for what we appear to be becoming, see this movie and know there is an awakening happening here, which I hope this masterful film will quicken."
"aram81","5","1","2","23 April 2020"," Only works as comic book fluff
","As a frivolous comic book movie, V for Vendetta is mostly an enjoyable ride. It has terrific production, with a dark and stylish atmosphere and a strong central performance by Natalie Portman. But outside of the limited scope of comic fluff, the film is a failure. The characters, with the exception of Portman's Evey and to a lesser degree, Stephen Ria's Finch are all two dimensional. John Hurt's Chancellor Sutler is a classic mustache twirling villain. As far as thematic richness, it's as deep as your average comic book. Its philosophical musings basically come down to authoritarian governments are bad and democracy and freedom are good. A very simplistic black and white outlook. And its all fed to us in a heavy-handed way, with all the subtlety of a bull in a china shop. If there is anything meaningful that can be take away from such a lightweight film, it's the moral bankruptcy of the whole enterprise. And i'm not just talking about terrorism and the ends justifying the means philosophy of V. What's really troubling is the serious case of Stockholm syndrome and brainwashing that the film is condoning. At best this is a silly comic book movie and can be enjoyed on that level. If taken any seriously, it becomes a paper thin and problematic film. If taken very seriously, it's dangerous."

","This film is a modern take on what is seen as a cult classic amongst many avid comic book and dystopian fiction fans, and what is seen here does majorly take that novel and make it a right proper film; however, it seemly has cut bits and pieces of the original story out, mixed them all around, and put them together again. Many key moments and characters are cut or scrapped, seemingly for cost or time reasons, leaving the movie to feel like somewhat of an empty husk of what the book was. It adds very little to make this feel distinguished from the novel, but it still lacks so much of what made the novel great that it seems we don't get much in the way of originality OR a revamped telling of the comic. Not to say that there aren't positives. Writing improvements have been made in most characters that make the ones we do see stand out more, and connect with the viewer better, and some of the casting choices are quite spot on, a personal favorite being John Hurt playing Chancellor Sutler, which stuck with me after the film had ended. This is an entertaining watch, but if you want to experience the best possible version of this story told, you're better off reading the original."

","It's been a long time since I read the Alan Moore source comic, so I couldn't tell you how well ""V for Vendetta"" is as an adaptation. But it does make for a great movie.<br/><br/>Herein, you can find references to '1984' and 'Fahrenheit 451', not to mention a clarion call for chaos in the name of liberty - all under the umbrella of fascism (a potent theme, and one that makes anarchy fashionable). But it's also fairly moving story, which says a lot for a Wachowski action movie. Also, can I just say that it makes knives way cooler than guns? And it's not just the blood sprays and the explosions that give the movie power, but the spoken words themselves.<br/><br/>And speaking of dialogue, Hugo Weaving is the movie's winning asset. Give the guy credit for conveying emotion under an inexpressive mask, but more than that, the sonorous tones of his voice make the vaudevillian word play extremely appealing. He uses it to profound effect. The whole cast is great, but he was a novel choice for V.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I've heard bad things about ""Jupiter Ascending"" and I never had any interest in ""Cloud Atlas,"" but ""V for Vendetta"" is a fine film--something I certainly can't say about the final entry in ""The Matrix"" trilogy. I have no negative criticisms about this film, and it is quite rewatchable. Plus it has an important message. John Hurt as the primary bad guy was a good bit of casting, and it is interesting to note that in this movie he is practically playing Big Brother and in ""1984"" he played Winston Smith. Hugo Weaving is great of course, despite his having to act behind a mask--a no doubt quite difficult task. Natalie Portman delivers a solid performance. Above par action in this movie, and impressive effects. Its positive reception and legacy are unsurprising. While this movie can't undo the failure of The Wachowskis' famous trilogy it, like the first ""Matrix,"" is a stellar addition to their oeuvre. Perhaps The Wachowskis will someday make a film I am interested in again. ""Remember, remember, the 5th of November..."""
"jimbo-53-186511","7","1","2","26 May 2014"," An interesting film about the impact of a future totalitarian British government, but there is so much more to this than meets the eye
","V for Vendetta focuses mainly on the characters of V (Hugo Weaving) and Evey (Natalie Portman) who happen to meet by chance when V rescues Portman from 'The Fingerman' - who were attempting to arrest her for being outside after the 11pm curfew. Their first encounter shows V explaining his plan to blow up the Houses of Parliament in exactly 12 months time on the 5th November. V demonstrates his point by blowing up another building in London. V then ups the ante by hi-jacking BTN (British Television Network) and outlines his plans for the 5th November to the entire nation. Upon hearing this, the police swarm the building and come close to arresting V, but Evey intervenes, but gets knocked unconscious as a result. V rescues her again and as Evey is deemed to be allied with V she finds herself on the run from both the government and the police with V.<br/><br/>I think where V for Vendetta truly excels is in its story telling - the Wachowski's do seem to be able to combine style and substance really well. Both The Matrix and V for Vendetta combined both elements really well. We are initially lead to believe that this is just one man with a vendetta against the government. Like Evey, we dismiss V as some sort of 'vigilante lunatic', but V has a reason to avenge the government and it's about a lot more than politics. V for Vendetta is rich in character development - the whole back story about V and his mother which explains why V targeted those in power. Whilst V is clearly opposed to living in a dictatorship, his main reason for vengeance is down to what they did to both him and his mother. I initially thought that the mask was a bit of a gimmick, but as soon as we see V's scarred hands and learn of the fire we can easily put two and two together. Likewise with Evey, we learn that her parents were political activists who were both killed when she was very young. The fact that we learn so much about the characters and their lives helped to care for them as people.<br/><br/>One of the strongest scenes in the film was when Evey has her head shaved and becomes incarcerated. It's quite clear that the whole point of this exercise was for V to test Evey and to make sure that she had no fear before releasing her. This was clearly done to make sure that Evey had the mental toughness to perform the 'final act'. This scene would have been even better if it hadn't been so predictable. The fact that I knew it was V that incarcerated her all along (the voice gave it away) did weaken the scene slightly, but overall it was still one of the best parts of the film.<br/><br/>There were weak areas in V for Vendetta; the fight choreography was generally good - although the final fight scene involving all the knives was a bit ridiculous. It was impressive to look at, but not entirely realistic - a little bit too much style perhaps? There was also the aftermath of V hi-jacking BTN; he manages to fit masks to several members of staff after tying their hands together so that the police won't be able to single him out. This was very clever, but how did he manage to get all the masks into BTN in the first place? <br/><br/>Despite the minor problems this is still a very good film - it's stylish, it's well acted and it's got a great story. The character of V is also interesting. It's a film that I found had much more to it than meets the eye."

","In the near future of an alternate Great Britain, freedom fighter V (Hugo Weaving) uses terrorist tactics to fight the oppressive society. He rescues Evey (Natalie Portman) from the creepy policemen.<br/><br/>The general state of affairs is too confused early on. Other than the crazed ramblings of a madman, there isn't much explaining. It's all generalities and high minded language. It would help to set aside a small segment to explain this universe a little better at the beginning. They really should have either concentration camps, unending wars, book burnings, or goose stepping. Instead the setting feels like today's world slightly shifted. It's not enough. The thing with George Orwell. He created completely new worlds. There's so much they could have done.<br/><br/>V's voice is distracting. Speaking thru the mask is problematic. It leaves conversation with him cold and distant. It would be better to cut those scenes down. The pacing gets very slow in the middle. The police is chasing him down, but there's never a close call. It grinds down as they slowly reveal the history. It's way too slow, way too late. They should have done this earlier, in a shorter prelude section. This is what the 1st act is for. And if this is such a police state with control of the media, how the heck did that program get on the air in the first place? If Evey's torture is all V's doing, how much of the stories we're shown can be believed? Or are they created to convert Evey?"
"evancyl","8","1","2","16 August 2013"," Action combined with a salient political message
","Action combined with a salient political message about sums up V for Vendetta. Britain is under totalitarian rule. Inspired by Guy Fawkes, V, a masked fighter, intends to start a revolution by blowing up Parliament on November 5th. He saves Evey, a young woman employed at the British Telecasting Network during her accidental run-in with the secret police, and brings her to watch the Bailey explode with fireworks. The next day, he infiltrates the BTN to appear on national TV and rescues her from the police that are now pursuing her. We see her attitude to society evolve during the movie - from passivity to a determination to push for change. The Chief Inspector, who is in charge of capturing V, also begins to question things when V reveals that the death of 80,000 was a deliberate government medical experiment.<br/><br/>I think the movie's main message was that we must be released from fear and willing to do battle in order to realise our political ideals. However, the means by which V goes about this raises ethical questions. For example, during his takeover of the broadcasting station, he forced all the others in the room to don masks, so as to make his escape easier. He also killed all the people involved in the medical experiment as well as the Chancellor. People would argue that such individuals should be made to stand trial, and not simply eliminated by a vigilante. I would prefer a clearer message rather than something as murky as this, but the screenplay and pacing were really good hence it gets an 8."

","An unusual film with a distinct style it is certainly unlike most other things you will watch though how close it sticks to source material I cannot say having not read the graphic novel. I can say though that the writing is great and the dialogue is intelligent without being patronising or unrealistic. Intertwining politics and action the plot keeps you engaged along with the cinematography which is beautiful without over the top Matrix style effects. The acting is also brilliant with Hugo Weaving delivering a stunning performance. Special mention also goes to Malcolm Sinclair who does a surprisingly great job even if not the biggest name. The fact that they drew from the talented pool of British actors who though slightly less known add to the setting and feel of the film whilst delivering great performances.

All it proves however, is that the world we live in is nothing like anything resembling what is portrayed in ""V for Vendetta"". This is completely undermining their values and love for the film in the first place.

","What can anyone do in the face of true tyranny? When simple criticism is outlawed, what chance does a revolution have? How do you inspire a nation that's been bullied into silence?<br/><br/>The story begins with a comment on the power of an individual idea. Additionally, we are given a brief history of a failed rebellion in Great Britain and the man behind it, Guy Fawkes (portrayed by Clive Ashborn). Next, we flash-forward to an unspecified point in the United Kingdom's future. A future in which a man by the name of Lewis Prothero (called The Voice of London and played by Roger Allam) has his own nightly broadcast and uses it to espouse his own political beliefs which always ends with the phrase ""good guys win, bad guys lose, and, as always, England prevails"". Prothero is shown to the viewer on two different screens being watched by two different people. One of them, Evey Hammond (portrayed by Natalie Portman) is preparing for an evening out and turns off her television as she leaves, saying ""That's quite enough of that. Thank you very much."" The other viewer is left unidentified. Once Hammond has left her home, a public address system notifies the citizenry that a ""yellow coded"" curfew is now in effect. Worried that she might face consequences if she is discovered, Hammond suddenly hurries. Unfortunately, she is accosted by two men. Soon after threatening her, they identify themselves as government officials and make it clear that they intend to assault her. All seems lost for Ms. Hammond until a masked man, (voiced by Hugo Weaving) intervenes on her behalf. Our man in the mask subdues Ms Hammond's attackers and then tells her that she may call him V. V claims to be a musician on the way to a concert and asks Evey to join him. V appears delusional to Evey at first, conducting a symphony that she can neither see nor hear, when the same public address system that informed of the curfew begins playing Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. Before the song is finished, she is surprised again by an explosion which destroys the Old Bailey, home of the Central Criminal Court and an iconic piece of London architecture. As V revels in the destruction of the Old Bailey, it becomes clear to Evey that he was responsible and as government officials observe her next to V in the surveillance footage, they incorrectly assume Evey was somehow involved.<br/><br/>When V for Vendetta was first in theaters, it was the source of much debate. Fans of the graphic novel complained that it took liberties with the story. Others worried that it justified terrorism. Having not read the graphic novel, I can't comment on the first part. On the second part, at the time it occurred, people might've seen the Boston Tea Party as terrorism. In a totalitarian state, where dissent is a criminal act in and of itself, terrorism might very well be the best vehicle for change. And it's because of that, an engaging and suspenseful story, and stellar performances from the main and supporting cast that I count V for Vendetta among my favorite movies. I have seen it many times since it was released on DVD and I will, no doubt, watch it many more. If what I've written intrigues you at all and you haven't seen this film yet, you absolutely should. Just one man's opinion."
"Josh_The_Third","6","1","2","4 November 2012"," Good plot, Good acting, problematic movie...
","Having read the comics I was expecting a good plot - not a perfect adaptation of the comics - a good plot, and it is here and works fine.<br/><br/>The other strength of this movie is of course Natalie Portman, who always does a convincing job. The problem is she does it in an unconvincing movie!!<br/><br/>and here we arrive at the major problem of this movie: The pacing. This is a very popular problem in modern film. The pacing is horrible - the scenes come and go very fast, asking you to believe a lot without giving you real content to hold on to. The result: 1. V for Vendetta has no exposition, you hardly ever learn anything about any of the characters, making their development uninteresting. Why? because their characters have no start point to compare to. (excepting the inspector, who is an example of a well-written character)<br/><br/>2. With no exposition and no time taken to introduce Portman's character, it is not easy to care for her or identify with her. Same goes for V himself. The touchy-feely side of this movie doesn't work at all.<br/><br/>3. The third and last problem is that since the pacing is so fast, the writers did not really have the time to build any mystery around V and his plans. Beside one good twist, you can pretty much guess where each scene is going, and is constantly being fed ""facts"" with a spoon. V's cunning can be compared to the Joker on The Dark Knight. They are both agents of Chaos. Yet while the Joker is the master of violent surprise, everything on V for Vendetta feels like a dreamy Deja Vu.<br/><br/>In a sense, the entire movie can be viewed as Evey's Dream, and that may be intentional, but this constant unreal feeling made me more sleepy than interested. This movie is nice but will not make you stand up and protest again the ones enslaving you. It is more likely to send you off to sleep!"

","This is without a doubt a modern day masterpiece! And, I really love how it just rips the whole fear fueled by the media/fascist government/terrorism by our own government wide open. It is a great film that deals with the freedoms of speech, thought, and religion being stripped away from us in a fascist community, allowing a government to rule over the people instead of the people ruling the government, as it was intended when the government for the people, by the people was created. <br/><br/>This is the second best film of 2006 (2nd only to De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia""). The political statements about ""terrorism"" and how it can be induced by the very same government that's supposed to protect us is something that mirrors our own society today. Our freedoms are being stripped one by one. This film is about a fascist government that installs fear in its people by acts of terrorism, blaming such acts on 'enemy' foreigners, when the acts were committed by the very same government that's supposed to be protecting the people from such terrorist acts; like our own country! <br/><br/>I highly recommend this film, especially to anyone who knows the REAL reality of our fascist state. It will bring out the 'commie' in most people who oppose our fascist politicians and the ongoing senseless war. This is without a doubt a masterpiece, entertaining and bravely 'open' about our current state of political stance in our 'free' world. And, especially pharmaceutical companies keeping people drugged (think Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Oxycotin, something that's ripping across America like wildfire; and, it's legal!) so they will believe all the lies and continue to live in fear really hits close to home. No matter what someone's political party is, be it Democrat, Republican, or Independent, this is a film that's VERY important for EVERYONE to see!<br/><br/>People need to wake up before this happens to us! Think about it, racism, homophobia, anti-religion, and anti-independent thought is becoming the norm, and listening to fools and the general masses is something that's promoted as the way to follow. As Black Sabbath said in a 1981 song ""The Mob Rules"", if you listen to fools, the mob rules. That has become such a prophetic statement, and it's dealt with very openly in this film. In a great reference to ""Phantom of the Opera"", ""1984"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Brave New World"", ""Blade Runner"", ""They Live"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", ""Metropolis"", and Michael Moore's documentary ""Farenheit 9/11"", the Wachowski brothers deliver their best film since ""Bound"". <br/><br/>We live in a country where at the age of 18, a person is considered an adult, and can vote, and can be called into a stupid war to defend their country, a war that was started by our very own government to serve their own agendas. We started quickly declining into a fascist state when our former president was in charge, leading us with his ignorance, cockiness, and overwhelming stupidity. We as a nation need to wake up and bond together and say ""Stop!"" before it's too late. And, it's definitely time to stop all of the hate crimes! <br/><br/>This is an important and entertaining movie that you'll want to view over and over. It's political and romantic, and very intelligent. Oh, and, the British humor thrown in midway through via a television show is pure genius! Very well written, brilliantly directed, and intensely acted by a topnotch cast! It is definitely one you will want to own so you can view it over and over, like a favorite album. Thank you. :>)"

","""V for Vendetta"" succeeds in being both unique and captivating in depicting a lone crusader (Hugo Weaving) and an improbable ally (Natalie Portman) battling against a tyrannical London regime.<br/><br/>The audience at the Majestic 20 theatre in Silver Spring, Maryland broke into applause at the end of the film, a rare response for a movie that had already been in theatres for over a week. Captivating from the opening scene through the finish, V for Vendetta tells the story of a mysterious vigilante simply named ""V,"" who is determined to restore democracy to the people of London who have unknowingly fallen into the clutches of a totalitarian government that controls every aspect of their lives, from media to religion. V has an intricate plan to bring down the unjust government, but it does not involve his early encounter with a young woman named Evey, who quickly becomes involved with his plan and mysterious past. Narrowly avoiding the police, led by the troubled detective Finch (Stephen Rea), V and Evey embark on an adventure filled with drama, violence, and twists all the way to an immensely satisfying ending.<br/><br/>On the night I first saw the film, the theatre itself was, as usual, well managed, organized, and clean. The audience sat through fifteen minutes of previews (standard in most theatres now), but I enjoy the glimpses of upcoming movies so this, in my eyes, is never an inconvenience. We were forced to watch a few advertisements for coke and whatever else was being sold at the snack bar, but otherwise there were no intrusive elements that would disturb the experience. And because this movie is so captivating, the audience stayed perfectly silent, perhaps with the exception of gasp or whisper at key moments.<br/><br/>What struck me about V for Vendetta was its sheer uniqueness. Most films, especially those with big budgets like V, follow a certain template very closely. So, when this movie veered away from where I expected it to go, and employed unique special effects and filming, I was surprised and pleased. The premise itself is unique; a mixture of fantasy and reality, the world in which V operates doesn't exist, but easily could if only a few things went wrong in our society. The film also succeeds in getting the audience to support a protagonist who is partly driven by rage and revenge, who never shows his face, but is somehow endowed with superhuman strength and skill. V is lovable because he has ideals, a vision for the future of Britain, and a love for art and culture, an unusual trait for a superhero. The plot is complex, so the film demands the viewers' complete attention for its duration. So, if you're looking for a simple action film or a straightforward drama, V for Vendetta is not the movie for you.<br/><br/>In the end, V for Vendetta succeeds in achieving every goal it sets for itself. The acting and characters are spectacular, the scenery superb, and, for all the action lovers out there, the fight scenes are riveting. V for Vendetta is one of my favorite films of all time; watch it."

Natalie Portman's rotten British accent is still pretty tough to get past, but with that exception the roles were almost perfectly cast and the themes present in Alan Moore's graphic novel are still as appropriate today as they were in the early '80s. Although I spotted a few surprising omissions from the original story, the recent translation of another Moore story, Watchmen, has taught me that many times a direct panel-for-panel recreation isn't the right way to go, either. Good enough, but not nearly what it could - perhaps should - have been."

Some beautiful turns of phrase – so much so that it's worth watching over and over again – that the hero is masked lets us both not identify with him on a personal level and yet totally identify with him on a much larger symbolic level and at one point his turn of phrase implies I am more than a face - at another, he states that beneath the mask is more than face there are ideas (which is why he can't die - symbolically) – the masks again, later in the film disguise individuals acting in concert for one idea – a really great use of a dramatic symbol -- watch for the falling dominoes and remember ""they will fall one domino at a time"" --- this is almost always true of chaotic fundamentalist groups, politicians and nations.<br/><br/>Watch for the references to a recent presidential administration (that impliedly led to the situation at hand in the film) – watch for the symbolism in Creedy's closing statement to V you have nothing  we have guns – even without the intense play on symbolism the storyline Is beautiful Wonderfully filmed at angles that best portray the feelings the writers want to evoke – a lot of ground level filming lots of intense close ups – watch for amazing slow mo of the knives near the end (beware not for small kids) but the filming, the cinematography is wonderful.<br/><br/>Beautifully acted – so much power behind a voice and mask that you don't even need facial expressions from Weaving and a fabulous portrayal of Evey by Natalie Portman – Stephen Frye shines as always – what a lovable character he comes off with (ditto for his psychiatrist role in NCIS) just a super good guy always characterizing an amazing sense of humor- This is now an ""old"" film but so worth watching if we can take something from it – there is power in numbers - we CAN change the world and what we are currently doing has us on a path for certain destruction – this was Parliament but could so have been the Whitehouse, Congress, a representation of oppressive political power in the world.<br/><br/>I love this film and if it has a cult following, I am a cult member!"

","I was a bit disappointed the first time I watched V, enough to give it a 8/10. It was the cheesy and prolonged ending that bothered me and spoiled the otherwise very enjoyable movie. In my opinion they should have ended it right when the subway train left off with V for his viking funeral, and all the *freedom-fight* sequences after that weren't necessary, just a cliché in the moment you least want it.<br/><br/>But I read Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel the other day and it saddened me how much of that great story was omitted, even the overall context was changed and mellowed down to modern politically correct anti-Bush statements.<br/><br/>So great film, poor adaptation and a big disappointment for me."
"guajolotl","Null","1","2","15 October 2006"," The idea of the vanguard has serious limitations.
","I thought this movie was excellent as a movie, but at the same time it would be a serious mistake if anyone thought anything like this would work in real life. V was counting on ""the masses"" rising up to vindicate the struggle against the dictatorship, but it doesn't work that way. Resistance may be clandestine, but revolutions can never be, and the idea that a few brilliant brave men and women are going to lead the rest is by its very nature elitist. That is a good recipe for corruption further on down the line, and there is nothing to prevent the transference of one dictatorship to another, no matter how high-minded in its origins. The clues are that V and his comrades are active and interesting (there's no denying that), but the people in their houses and pubs are mere decoration. Why weren't they involved? The trench-coat mafia parade at the end doesn't count. Didn't they have an actor's union card? The movie business in real life is elitist, and this is necessarily reflected in the plot (stars and supporting players). Additionally, it would have been stronger if Evye had been tortured by real government agents, and had become fearless thereby. However, the idea of control of a virus used as control of the population is interesting, and has echoes in the LSD and syphilis experiments, and as some have implied, in the (manmade??)HIV virus."
"ozjeppe","8","1","2","15 October 2006"," Majestic and rousing... sci-fi escapism at its grandest!
","Majestic, rousing saga set in England in the near future where a feisty young woman (Portman) is pulled into a rebellion against a fascist/totalitarian government, headed by mysterious leader Weaving. Long and absorbing; it manages to blend old-time matinée panache with frightening futuristic elements of the likes of ""1984"" and ""Twelve monkeys"". No serious strive for realism; (being based on the Alan Moore graphic novel as it is) it goes head-on for major and quite audacious escapism, with great results. Fine script is matched by equally impressive visual flair, so it's no surprise that the Wachowski brothers were behind this one. ""Remember, remember the 5th of November!"" We sure will.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 from Ozjeppe"
"Turriff","9","1","2","21 September 2006"," V for Vendetta...I'm hooked...
","I knew from the very first review that I was going to like V for Vendetta. I'm always curious, and a bit leery, of how much that feeling towards the movie, sight unseen, affects my viewing of it...<br/><br/>I was right, of course...I really liked this movie...<br/><br/>However, I watched it after its DVD release, long after the aforementioned reviews...I had only the recommendation of a friend from work and from the owner of my local video store. So how biased was I? who knows...<br/><br/>But the film does deal with the power of an Idea...and while my idea that I would like the movie is not anywhere near the grand scale of the ""overthrow the Government and stand up for freedom"" idea that drives the film, maybe it had power all of its own...<br/><br/>By the time I watched this film, I had forgotten that it was connected with the makers of the Matrix series, the Wachowski brothers...<br/><br/>The film, on the whole was fantastic. I cannot stress how good Hugo Weaving is as V, the main character, given that his face is covered by a mask for the entire film. Despite the loss of the most important means of visual inter-personal communication (facial gestures), Weaving delivers a stunning performance. The scripting is fantastic, so make sure to pay attention to the monologues. Portman delivers a solid performance, and a quiet Stephen Rea is a masterful detective/skeptic.<br/><br/>The film is both solidly constructed and beautifully shot. My one problem with the film, however are the special effects. Some gratuitous cg and un-necessary, particularly in the final fight scene. An earlier scene, involving violence, is well done, using editing and other conventional techniques to portray the characters prowess. The final scene resorts to poor cg and looks entirely out of place in the otherwise real looking movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this movie deserves to be watched, and well. Don't expect an action movie, but be prepared to think. Not as many conflicts of philosophy as the Matrix, but still one worth thinking about.<br/><br/>Over all, this movie definitely rates a 4.5 outta 5, and my girlfriend, much to my surprise, really enjoyed it."
"GavAnderson","7","1","2","13 September 2006"," It could have been a so much more...
","Here is a film for modern day, a film that openly discusses the state of government, more so in America than England in my opinion. But the flaws, those ugly flaws that drag it down, ever so slightly but just enough to rip it from the grip of perfection. Lets start with the director who never makes any real commitment to particular style for the film; he seems torn between getting the idea across and making it appealing to a mainstream audience. The script also suffers the same flaws, adding a sense of humour and personality to the main character yet expecting him to be seen as an Idea not a man. It tries to be dark, to be all about the idea, but it also wants to hit the mainstream audience, and yes it does this, and yes it gets the message across, however, it also looses some of its power in doing so. This film is not bold, exciting, and inventive. The ideas are there but it still persists in following the old, going with what has worked before and will work again, the main goal is to make money, and it's this business focus that stops it from being a giant, that stops it from being something truly special. It's through experimentation the Matrix redefined cinema, V for Vendetta is afraid to do so, it's afraid of failure in the mainstream and so it is just another Matrix influenced action film, and a good idea. However it isn't bad, it just doesn't meet its potential. In fact it's rather good; it just feels like it could have been so much more, if only it could resolve its conflicts and truly define itself."
"asurasuria-1","6","1","2","3 September 2006"," Great Ideas via Hollywood Inc.
","Is this film Hollywood? Yes. The shot structure is rather characteristic of plot-driven Hollywood style and all the traditional elements are there. But, I'm willing to forgive the subtle romantic subplot, the classic one-liners, and the lack of confidence in the viewer for a sufficient grasp of complexity and praise it for its daring. This film is a play on the parody of our times, and is, by all means, worth seeing. Do they drive the ""message"" in too deep, yes. Several of the senseless melodramatic elements (especially towards the end) could have been omitted, leaving something that would make a much greater impact. (Watching this film you can clearly see how the Hollywood formula was slapped on it with little regard to maintaining the integrity and intensity of the script.) Anyhow, I applaud the Wachowski brothers for approaching a construct of American issues with a nazistic/communistic sensibility that could have only been gained through generational experience of both Eastern Europe and the US. In short, go see this film, and don't be afraid to take bathroom breaks after the first half."

This usually hurts the chances of me loving a movie. Also, I may have built it up to much, I was expecting something so great that I wasn't as happy with the very good movie that I got as I should have been. That being said, I did enjoy the movie, and felt that it was done extremely well.

"saturnalia33","7","1","2","20 June 2006"," Highly watchable but lacking in firm ground
","V for Vendetta is another comic book adaptation from Alan Moore whose previous works - The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and Hellboy - were brought to the silver screen and, I have to say, sucked pretty hard. However, there was more hope for this movie because the screenplay was written by the Wachowski brothers and the director James McTeigue was the first assistant director on all three Matrix flicks indicating that there would be a happier working structure between what's on the page and what appears on celluloid. Nevertheless, controversy surrounded the movie due to the use of scenes of the bombings on the London Underground train network and Alan Moore publicly disassociating himself from the movie and cutting his remaining ties with DC Comics.<br/><br/>The film is set in a futuristic England that has become a fascist state akin to something straight from 1984 where the government controls all form of life and the public are told what the government want the people to believe. However, a lone figure makes an entrance onto the stage to refute the current state of being, opposing the government and fighting for the freedom from autocracy. Caught up in his plot to overthrow the current state, Evey, played by Natalie Portman, is seduced by V, played by a masked Hugo Weaving and becomes a target herself.<br/><br/>Over the course of the film, Evey discovers herself in an implausible manner that I cannot divulge lest giving plot detail away, and becomes V's unofficial aide and ultimately plays a vital role in his crusade.<br/><br/>Whilst I found the movie to be highly watchable, it was also lacking in firm ground, and was as fictitiously futuristic as it was unbelievably unconvincing in terms of suspension of disbelief. The acting all round was over the top but entertaining and despite its lacking, it is a decent action thriller worthy of renting for a Friday or Saturday evening."
"Angeneer","9","1","2","12 May 2006"," A must-see experience
","Oh boy... This movie sure knows how to make an impression.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning we are immersed deep into an Orwellian world (after all the plot and for that matter, the whole comic series by Alan Moore, is very similar to 1984). The big screens depicting the Big Brother are a direct tribute to 1984, the movie. But V for Vendetta is more vibrant, more colourful and much more entertaining than 1984.<br/><br/>All the performances are top class (especially Natalie Portman is amazing, finally her performance in Leon found its match). The direction is sublime and the political references are so many, you really cannot miss them. A very strong denunciation of today's tactics of instigation of fear by the governments against their own people.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta manages at the same time to offer high class entertainment and a strong political message. It is a must see and a proof that art can be serious when it's needed. Don't miss also the London references, always a pleasure for me to spot since I absolutely love this city."

","V not only stands for vendetta. He represents revenge, the fight against suppression, liberation of the masses and the freedom of thought. Oscar Wilde said once: ""Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth."" Well, this Zorro of the future reveals the truth, not only for himself, but for all the oppressed ones, the common people who can change the world. ""V for vendetta"" sums up ideas found in Orwell's ""1984"", Gaston Leroux's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" and other movies such as ""The Mask of Zorro"" or ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"". In my opinion, the reinvigoration of these ideas is very appropriate nowadays. I especially liked Portman's performance, who proves yet another time that she can represent the most fanciful character in a natural way."

","So far in 2006 only a few movies have really stood out to me, 16 Blocks, Inside Man, Ice Age 2 and V For Vendetta. V For Vendetta was one of the movies I was waiting for this year and I had some doubts as I heard that it was a tad different then the highly praised graphic novel. But, it turned out to be a movie that blew me away and totally exceeded my expectations. Hugo Weaving, I thought, nailed V the same way he nailed Agent Smith. Natalie Portman was absolutely fantastic in this movie. V For Vendetta is the type of movie that you want to know more about it as its going on, it completely held my attention even though at one point it tended to slow up. So As far as I'm concerned V For Vendetta might be one of the best movies of the year."

","I've just watched this movie and I liked it a lot. Apart from the solid acting and the great cinematography, this film really got hold of me because it exactly shows how we live in undemocratic countries, as we do to some extent here in Egypt, and it's a warning to what may even happen to other democratic countries if they give in to fear of terrorism and give up their rights to their governments until they gradually become what we've seen in this great movie. I think that almost every line spoken by ""V"" can easily be a valuable quote. All in all, I think this movie deserves 10 out of 10, mainly because of the messages and values it delivers and for it's fine cinematography"

Why they wrote it. Where it originally came from. I hadn't seen or heard much about the film before I went to see it tonight. In fact, I thought it was about a girl who had a life altering experience and she goes on a rampage to get revenge.<br/><br/>Instead, when I walked out of the theater after the 2-hour long story, I felt as though I needed to watch it again. To be inspired by it's story. To take more of an interest in the world that we live in. Because how much do we really know?<br/><br/>The actors performances were great. Particularly Nathalie Portman. She's a joy to watch and she takes you right along for the emotional journey. Hugo Weaving's performance will draw you right in. His talent,<br/><br/>engaging you in his emotion all the while being hidden behind a mask, shines.<br/><br/>I highly recommend it to everyone. Well, everyone that takes an interest in the world around them. And maybe to those who don't. Maybe it will open your eyes. Get your wheels turning in your mind. Whet your curiosity to find out more about what is really out there. Give you a thirst for knowledge you didn't know you had.<br/><br/>It's a powerful story."
"afrattezi","10","1","2","21 April 2006"," as good as the magazine
","""V"", now on film, is almost as good as the original magazine. The media are so different that we can make big mistake is we just film sequenced frames of the magazine. On the contrary, the movie brings us the expressions and the voice of the character we missed on paper. The Wachowski brothers have done a very good job on the adaptation, indicating they fully understood the text. The story remains sadly actual, with Blair and Bush Jr on the paper of Thatcher on our real world. Despite the horror of the deaths, it brings us again the appeal of anarchy: some governors are better off dead. Maybe the reality of terrorism of our days will shade some of the glow of the film. Nevertheless the power of Moore's text is evident and actual (credits do not include author's name was his will; the magazine's illustrator, Lloyd, is credited. The mixture of father and beloved turns V into a richer character; his relationship with Evey is above human's, idealized and work well. After two decades and in a entirely different medium, the original story gains strength. Both the adaptation and the direction achieve its goal, through the excellent performances of Portman and Weaving, not to mention Hurt."

","It was a huge mistake to expect from this movie something very Matrix-like. I mean it does have a lot of things in common, but the genre is quite different.<br/><br/>The similar things about two movies is new created reality that is not suitable for normal people's lives. The similar thing is that movie also have a lot of symbols, but all of them is thoroughly explained to the audience unlike many unsolved quests from Matrix.<br/><br/>However, Vendetta is an emotional movie, one of the many messages is that one should appreciate freedom and not to let the authorities take over completely. Special effects which are nice are not priority, that one may be looking forward to watch after the Matrix.<br/><br/>Portman is a wonderful actress, by the way... The character she is playing is a matured girl from Leon. Fear, pain - she demonstrates them with a child-like expression on her face. But when she was crying I also began to cry, because she was very very convincing."

","When I heard of this movie I didn't want to see it - I wasn't a Matrix fan, don't generally care for that ""genre"", so why would it appeal to me? After several different people said ""see it, you'll like it"" I finally did - and I more than liked it, I LOVED IT!! Admittedly I am a Phantom of the Opera fan and the parallels to that character (of which there are many-the mask, the cape, the roses are just a few) were delightful to me. But the plot was also thought-provoking and I found myself sitting in the dark theater alone as the credits rolled thinking about it, and I was driven to return the next night to see it again, in an IMAX theater (which I highly recommend if it is available in your area). It was bigger, better, even more powerful in the second viewing. This is a keeper, one of those I must own on DVD. Hugo Weaving is mesmerizing as V, he makes the character sympathetic and compelling though his face remains completely masked. He has some very tough passages of dialogue as well, quite impressive! Natalie Portman is incredible as Evey, she is probably the most talented actress of her generation and she gets to demonstrate her skills here, she shines. I was concerned about the level of violence given its R rating but I didn't find the violence particularly graphic. There is one sequence I call the ""blood ballet"" which is done so artistically that it does seem like a dance rather than a series of bloody killings. If you thought this film wasn't for you - think again and then go see it."

If you did not see it yet, hurry and watch it, doesn't matter where, as long as you will watch it-it will help you in many ways. I'm not a particular fan of Portman, but her role helped develop V's character, so it is my opinion that all actors played flawlessly. I enjoyed the core of the movie, and since the first second it made me watch it motionless. I cried and I smiled - it was a perfect blend of an old movie with a futuristic ideal that many people would want to pursue. If you are ever down about anything in your life, or you think you go through pain, this movie is an excellent portrayal of what real people go through daily that we are not aware of."

Stephen fry in his role also inspired. the sounds in he film are brilliant as they are possibly the least noticeable thing but yet it made the film so much more eventful. the fighting scenes are of real quality and wonderfully pulled of by Hugo weaving who is an brilliant stage fighter.

","This is the first England-government story I watched. I think of England as a cold place, like Russia contrast to America- bright, sunshiny and gay. Politics is always a controversial thing, I see this picture as Hitler of England. But the story isn't about them, it is about V and Evey. Its almost a love story if Catherine Hardwicke should have made this one it is dark, funny but not in hugly way- it is still dark.<br/><br/>I only watched this movie because of IMDb, you people rated it 8.2 so I gave my time in watching one of the best movies of all time. The trailer before wasn't that much appealing, I thought it was one of the corny heroes and villains thing and a girl in between, with dark comedic appearance of V but it turned out I liked it too, just as much as most of IMDb people do.<br/><br/>V represents the heroes of good journalism, heroes of revolution against a monopoly or colony, heroes that somehow desperately screamed for justice and fairness but it landed on deaf ears. He maybe the voice of the oppressed, the weak, the experimented, but he too was the hero of the weak, the oppressed and the tested.<br/><br/>This is one of Hero movies, although it doesn't fall under the category of a fairy tale well I guess, all hero movies are not fairy tales because heroes will not be heroes unless they die, and before they die, they experience massive pain and titanic failures. They also die without knowing the real significance of what they did to humanity. In the end whether their loved ones experience the freedom they fought for or they would die too in agony and pain.<br/><br/>V is a movie I liked because of good actors and good directing, good story lines and not with a crappy script. The special effects are good even if it wasn't made extravagantly or wasn't made too sophisticated it is almost not true I know its not true but movies should make their audiences feel the impact of the movie, like real or something."

","V for Vendetta was a very interesting movie. Let me start by saying that Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving did an excellent job, they really captured their characters well. I thought the Wachowski's really gave a good feel of how bad of a situation the world was in by frequently showing news clips of how terrible America was functioning.I liked the pace of the movie, too, though I must admit that I did get lost a couple times, but got right back into it. This is definitely not a movie for everyone, the story is complex and makes you think. It's no Pulp Fiction, but it's harder to follow than average films are. Do not go into this movie expecting it to be action-packed or full of violence, because it's not, but that doesn't mean it's not a great film.

","""Remember, remember the 5th of November, the gun powder treason and plot. I know of no reason why the gun powder treason should ever be forgot."" <br/><br/>An incredibly fast-paced film with fine performances boosted with a high-rate script and a myriad of special effects emphasized with incredible cinematography... now that's what I call a MOVIE! Matrix creators Larry and Andy Wachowski sends us to their futuristic illusion of Great Britain under a totalitarian regime in this marvelous motion picture which captured the interest of many due to the alacrity of it's script and it's elusive set of characters bolstered by that cunning masked figure hiding behind the letter ""V."" <br/><br/>By violating the imposed curfew, young Evey (Natalie Portman) gets acquainted with this mysterious vigilante who rescued her from the dirty hands of a group of fascists. V (Hugo Weaving), with his odd congenial nature and his Guy Fawkes mask, subsequently escorts the girl on top of a London tower, where she witnessed the detonation of one of Britain's historical symbols in celebration of November the fifth.<br/><br/>Unsatisfied with this vendetta, V abducts an entire television station, shares an impassioned speech with the whole of Britain, and once again, meets up with Evey, which he took under his care for the meantime, to hide her from the authority. This was followed by a series of murders, the victims all has got something to do with the masked man's tragic past, in order to satisfy his voracity for vengeance. And step by step, he begins to make a change in Great Britain's totalitarian regime, not stopping until he reaches his main target: the great dictator, Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) I am so captivated by V's dangerous, hard-hitting, and brilliant lines, but lines alone doesn't make up the movie, right? The beauty of the film was further elevated by brilliant performances coming from Natalie Portman and the legendary John Hurt. Hugo Weaving, however, looks like all he's done is a mere voice-over, because he had never shown his face in the film's whole running time, not even for a quick sharp second.<br/><br/>The character, V, was the primary reason why I liked this film. It would be really cool if he was real, playing around with his pointy daggers and concealing himself in the darkness with his fashionable all-black couture. The Guy Fawkes mask is a must-snag, too. My compliments to the costume designer. His clever libertarian thoughts (this is the best of them all, in my opinion: ""People should not be afraid of governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."") fills me with inexplicable delight and I'm sure that those who've seen the movie also feels the same way. Relay my compliments to the screenplay writers too (the Wachowski brothers).<br/><br/>Well, as for the picture quality, it is, overall, amazing. The production design looks expensive, special effects were breath-taking, and the cinematography perfectly suits the impressive historical sights of Britain. You might enjoy it's picture quality even more by watching it on DVD.<br/><br/>It's not just for pleasure and entertainment, you can also draw out a lot of ideologies from this film like they're running all over the place. Do the right thing - sit back, relax, and watch this film... and then you'll end up as a bewildered and inspired libertarian."

","(Synopsis) The movie is set in Great Britain in the near future. Under the guise of several terrorist acts, a totalitarian government is elected to Parliament under Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) to save the country from these terrorists. The only problem is the people must give up a lot of their freedoms for being safe. The government eventually becomes cruel, corrupt, and oppressive to the people. Driven by a personal vendetta, a mysterious individual William Rookwood (Hugo Weaving) comes to the forefront to take up the cause of freedom. He wears a mask of Guy Fawkes to cover his face, and changes his name to only V. V's mission is to kill all the doctors who had tortured him at the detention center, and bring back justice to the country. On November 5, in the process of blowing up his first building, V rescues a young woman, Evey (Natalie Portman), from the secret police. V takes over the TV station and broadcasts a message to the country condemning the oppressors in Parliament. V invites all the people to join him in one year on Guy Fawkes Day to see him complete what Guy Fawkes couldn't, blow up Parliament.<br/><br/>(My Comment) After seeing the movie trailers several times, I had very low expectation of this movie. I was surprised after seeing it. The mask is kind of comical at first, but you get use to it, and it kind of mesmerized you. You begin to listen to the voice behind the mask, with his words of wisdom. The character of V is ruthless, yet he is also intelligent, compassionate and poetic, especially, towards Evey. V is a modern day Zorro on steroids. V ends up cutting more throats than were killed in the Kill Bill movie. The movie has the same feel as George Orwell's 1984. V would always leave a rose at the scene of each murder, perhaps to remind us that we should stop and smell the roses, before it is too late. The storyline was taken from a DC comic book. However, I think the political message and storyline are controversial in today's climate with terrorism in the world. V's actions are right, but his terrorist tactics are wrong.

","C'mon. There's gotta be 2 versions of this film out there. Right? There's the dismal version that I saw.

Some people (like me) saw the crap version - While others enjoyed the thrill of viewing the dynamite version. What else could it be?<br/><br/>Anyways - The minute that ""V"" boasted to Evey that his all-time fave flick was, in fact, ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", I knew that ""V For Vendetta"" was gonna suck, big time. (And, I was right) I guess that ""V"" loved this film with all of his heart 'cause its title character probably reminded him so much of his own deluded image of himself. Like, why else would someone love such a crap movie as ""The Count of Monte Cristo""?<br/><br/>I'd say that we (the audience) were all colossally cheated by the director/screenwriters of this disappointing film. For example - The fact that not even once were we ever given even a single glimpse of ""V's"" face is evidence of that. But, then again, maybe it was all just a cost-saving measure to try to save the producer a few bucks by cutting back on such things as expensive ""burn-victim"" make-up effects, or something like that.<br/><br/>All in all - ""V For Vendetta"" was 132 minutes of excruciatingly long and dragged out garbage."

This is one of the ways for an individual to have prejudgements, that's why i watched this movie two days ago. The movies which are full of action, too much blood, too much bullets may be seen as perfect by some people but they don't offer the watcher an idea, don't give the opportunity to. 'V for Vendetta' has both the action and the idea. The dialogues, which consist of the words i never heard before make the movie excellent. For one hour i read the quotes of the movie, wrote them all down and read them again. His voice while introducing the ideas he has... i can listen to him for hours. Every moment of the movie was worthy watching and the characters of the movie were doubtlessly experienced. I can't think of any other star that can take play 'V' as perfect as Hugo Weaving.

","Cinema is an art form that is all too often cheapened by unimaginative, lazy and dull film-making. V for Vendetta has none of these flaws. This is not to say that it is a flawless film; rather, I cannot imagine anything that would improve the overall experience. Technically, the movie is more than sound, it is excellent. Performances are uniformly powerful and nuanced, camera-work suits the design elements and from the script to the editing, the film looks and feels coherent. This is, however, something of a high-brow action film and as such there is an inherent contradiction, an attempt to entertain with philosophy. The Matrix shied away from the deeper questioning of V for Vendetta in favour of awesome technical wizardry, and was a much bigger popular success as a result. While V is undeniably pretentious and self-indulgent, it is well made enough to lift itself above such criticism. For anyone who sympathises with the ideologies championed by the eponymous character, this is a film that will leave you internally cheering. Or literally cheering, if you are less restrained than I.<br/><br/>The story itself is at once familiar and confronting – a totalitarian government pushes its citizenry too far, and a hero steps forth to try and overthrow the tyrants. But the genius of the storytelling is in the understatement. Vague references to events at 'St Mary's' and 'Threewaters' have little meaning to the audience until the later stages of the film, and the Wachowski Brothers have no qualms about revealing their plot slowly, using Stephen Rea's detective as a vehicle for their unveiling to their viewers (yes I am using alliterated V words. A tribute, I tell you). So much information is implied, rather than directly presented, that after numerous viewings there are still subtleties to the plot that are newly discovered. Piece by piece, the audience starts to understand the nature of the government that V rails against, and in doing so, they are positioned to question their own.<br/><br/>Given the film's release date, this is not only a controversial but also brave project. Highly critical of government responses to terrorism, this is a film as sensitive to the fear and paranoia of the post-9/11 world as it is in the anger and discontent about government responses to that tragedy. V's terrorism is never fully endorsed, and he alludes to the fact that he is attempting to create a world in which he may have no place, but his attacks on landmarks seem bloodless and the people he kills all either deserve it, as in his revenge on those who tormented him, or are faceless uniforms that steadily march into quite exciting if cartoonish action set pieces.<br/><br/>The graphic novel source is clear in both the imagery and atmosphere of V for Vendetta. Not only the painted Guy Fawkes mask, but the pseudo-Nazi flashbacks of the government's infancy and the fight scenes all seem a tribute to the original, if not a perfect adaptation (this film, however, is an achievement in and of itself and the relationship with the graphic novel is essentially trivia). The direction fetishizes the visual symbol, crowding V's lair with inter-textual contraband in a way that is at once pretentious, and also gifts the observant audience with another layer of meaning. There are so many cues to try and decipher that we never really learn what lies beneath the mask. (Ooh, cliché!) At its heart, V for Vendetta is a film about a message. The script foregrounds a concern with the power of ideas, and the constant battle to control and manipulate the media institutions of the diegetic world reinforces the film's paradox: this film attempts to undermine blind faith in the media we are presented, through a media presentation.<br/><br/>But what message is V attempting to convey to its audience? It asks questions about the nature of power and freedom, what it means to be human, the appropriate extent of political control, revision of history and the justification of violence. But the barrage of different points and ideas and suggestions doesn't undermine the central message – it clarifies it. Whatever we do, whatever the world becomes, we as a society need to keep asking deep questions, and answering them with our actions.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta may never receive the acclaim that it deserves, its own artistic indulgence a barrier for those who do not buy into the revolutionary and subversive undertones that permeate every aspect of the film. A work of genius, but like all genius, it is never completely accessible. This is still the most important film made this century, and one that will hopefully make its way into the school syllabuses of any truly free-thinking country around the world. Thought-provoking, uplifting, and inspiring. I have never seen anything else that compares."

"Chrysanthepop","Null","2","7","4 June 2009"," V for Vrogaritrofrietz
","I don't know much about the comic books 'V for Vendetta' is based on but the film is quite an interesting action thriller, with flaws. The element of suspense is well built. Even though it's easy to predict the end, you want to know what will happen after each subsequent event and what the lead character V's next step is. It is a well crafted movie, well put together, moving at a steady pace. The cast includes talented British actors like Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Ben Miles etc but it's really Hugo Weaving who is the star of 'V for Vendetta'. Wearing a mask throughout the entire film, the actor can only rely on his voice and body language which are used very effectively! His fantastic dialogue delivery and smooth gestures are evidence of what an incredible job he's done. In contrast, Natalie Portman is miscast and fails to convince as a British woman. As an action flick 'V for Vendetta' is expected to be loud but some scenes were unintentionally funny, like the blowing up of the parliament and the Brits cheering along. I bet if it was the White House it would have created some controversy (but become a funnier movie nonetheless). Anyway, the action sequences are brilliantly choreographed. Dario Marianelli's score is another strong point. To conclude, 'V for Vendetta' is a decent enough popcorn flick for a one-time watch."
"JamesHitchcock","4","2","7","6 January 2009"," A Strip-Cartoon for Middlebrows
","""V for Vendetta"" is a dystopian satire along the lines of Orwell's ""1984"", set at some unspecified future date, probably during the 2020s or 2030s. The world has been ravaged by war, and America has collapsed into anarchy. Britain has become a neo-Nazi dictatorship ruled by the Norsefire party and its leader Adam Sutler (a name doubtless chosen because of its similarity to Adolf Hitler). Most of the population is cowed by the regime and its secret police; only one man, a mysterious revolutionary known only as ""V"", continues to resist the dictatorship. We never learn V's real name or see his face, as he wears a Guy Fawkes mask at all times. At the beginning of the film, one November 5th, he succeeds in blowing up the Old Bailey (London's central criminal court). He announces that on the same date the following year he intends to achieve the original Guy Fawkes' ambition of destroying the Houses of Parliament.<br/><br/>Many of those who have reviewed this film have done so on the basis of their own political views. Left-wingers have praised it, seeing Sutler as a thinly-disguised portrait of President Bush and his regime, which persecutes minorities such as Muslims and homosexuals, as based upon the American Religious Right. Right-wingers tend to dislike it for the same reasons. I too disliked the film, although for different reasons; I am no great admirer of George W Bush or of the Religious Right. Insofar as the politics of the film are ""Democracy good, dictatorship bad"", I found them unexceptionable.<br/><br/>My main reason has to do with the characterisation of V himself. The film was based upon a ""graphic novel"", a phrase which normally translates as ""strip cartoon for highbrows, or at least middlebrows"", and, although V does not actually wear his underpants outside his trousers, he suggests that even when strip cartoonists (sorry, graphic novelists) try to deal with serious political issues they still think in terms of Superman-style superheroes. V has powers verging on the supernatural, not only superhuman strength and agility but also an uncanny ability to evade his enemies. He is able to penetrate government security, not only to destroy landmark buildings but also to kill high-ranking members of the regime with impunity. This reliance on the standard clichés of the superhero genre undermined any serious political intent the film may have had. Orwell's hero, Winston Smith, also fought a one-man war against the system, but in his case in vain. Orwell wanted to make the point that dictatorships, once established, are not easily overthrown.<br/><br/>Some actors can succeed in the difficult task of wearing a mask throughout a film- Edward Norton did so in ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and John Hurt did so brilliantly in ""The Elephant Man"". Hugo Weaving, however, never succeeds in making V interesting; he remains little more than a mask reciting his political ideas in a bland, upper-class voice. Even his ideas are not very interesting; there is no serious attempt to explore the ethics of using violence against a repressive regime. The Norsefire regime is so vile that the use of virtually any means to overthrow it is justified. The link with Guy Fawkes is also unconvincing, as Fawkes was not a freedom-fighter but a religious zealot. At most he was one of those who wanted freedom for himself but not for others.<br/><br/>Some of the other characters were also unsatisfactory. Natalie Portman plays Evey, V's love-interest and sidekick, with just two expressions, wide-eyed incomprehension and wide-eyed terror. Her accent was far too posh for her supposedly working-class character; like a number of foreign actors called upon to play a British role she simply opts for an RP accent without considering whether it is appropriate to her character. Stephen Fry plays a closeted gay chat-show host arrested for keeping a copy of the Koran, not because he is a Muslim but because he ""admires the beauty of its passages"". Which passages would those be? The ones proclaiming the wrath of Allah against homosexuals? (The film's tolerance towards Muslims does not extend to all religions; a Catholic priest is portrayed as a paedophile).<br/><br/>Some have praised the film for showing how the ""politics of fear"" can be exploited, but this argument misses the point that dystopian satire is a paranoid literary genre which itself relies upon the politics of fear. The essential message of all such works is that there are people out there- fascists, communists, neo-cons, the Religious Right, whoever- who are to be feared. Orwell wrote ""1984"" in the late 1940s as a warning against the dangers of totalitarianism. The trouble with ""V for Vendetta"" is that it seems more like a warning against the dangers of the past than those of the present. Overt fascism has very little support in modern Britain; if the neo-fascist BNP has achieved limited electoral success it has only done so by watering down the fascist elements in its ideology and posing as the voice of the white working class abandoned by New Labour. The palaeo-fascist National Front, which has refused to water down its ideology, enjoys virtually no support.<br/><br/>This does not mean that a dictatorship is not possible in a future Britain, but such a regime would almost certainly not be a carbon-copy of the Third Reich. Nor would it resemble a Stalin-style Communist regime. It would probably be a bureaucratic, centrist dictatorship which would not come to power through a revolution but through a process of gradual erosion of our civil liberties. It might even permit some sort of elections, although it would ensure that the tolerated parties did not offer any real choice to the voters. It would take away our freedom in the name of some impeccably worthy ideal. And it would probably justify its actions by claiming to protect us against horrid neo-Nazis like the ones we see in this film. 4/10"

Granted, there are some religious nuts in the world but the movie never cared to separate extremists from moderates. The use of religious symbols as evil was quite offensive. I am a pretty tolerant person but I get very angry when people attack ANY religion. It claims Muslims are being persecuted for their beliefs when they are really not.

In other words, he wants them to be mindless sheep and not have brains for themselves or the freedom to express anything.<br/><br/>Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) works at the BBC news as an assistant to pederast and news reporter Deitrich (Stephen Fry) along to members of the news where in one foggy night (November 5) she decides to go on a stroll where she's stop by Sutler's police after breaking curfew. They attack her until a vigilante who goes by the name of V (Hugo Weaving) saves Evey and takes her in protection. From there Evey and V form a bond where she sees that not only is he a man of vengeance, but an educated person who has books like a library and everything for a museum display.<br/><br/>As we see more in the film, V's personal business is to go after everybody from doctors, news reporters, priests, and anybody who had to do with his imprisonment leaving him to be the marked man he has become.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one great flick where I didn't keep my eyes off for one second just as it's not only an action movie produced by the same guys who made ""The Matrix,"" but features on impressive cast and a moral lesson to be considered."

","This is my movie. I had to say that at the time I finished watching this. I was impressed by V's idea and Evey's growth. Doesn't like many people think, this's really a romantic movie, not thriller and violent at all. You can see behind the mask is a open heart with warm soul - a man of art. We can not see any kiss in this movie - so different from other American movies, but you're emotional by the love V gave Evey, pure, amazing and disappointment behind all. I don't know why but I cry always when I listen to the song ""Cry me a river"" and remember final sayings of V. I've watched this for several times but I've never bored. There's a point that I've not had the answer: Was V lost his eyes in the fire at Larhill? It seemed They were burnt horribly by the fire, so that the doctor says "" there were no eyes"". And how could he keep Valerie's biography while everything was in fire? I can't understand. Anyway, I still like this. Every time I watch it, i find in it a new meaning. According to me, it's worth to be honored. People always say Natalie Portman's grate, I agree. But in some ways, Hugo Weaving's greater. Why? Because he had to act with a mask, that prevented him from expressing emotion. So that made his voice a special kind of face. You can feel all his emotion expressed through his amazing voice."

There is such a deep message in it which is delivered with so much beauty and love that it inspired me and changed my spirit. Beneath the Anarchist side of the movie, it is the mirror of our world, where everything seems to be fine, a world ruled by TV and the media in which we consider to be telling the truth about what happens. It represents the control governments have trough fear which they generate to attain power over us. And weak in mind as we are fall into it.

"psypeterson","10","2","7","6 January 2008"," Literally Left Me Speechless
","I have never walked out of a theater speechless before this movie, and I think it will be a long time before it happens again.<br/><br/>Acting: The acting in this film is top-notch. Everyone is believable, but each character has one or two traits about them that accents their ficticiousness, such as Weaving's occasional alliteration, or Portman's exaggerated innocence. Portman is the only real weak link in the chain, but that is mostly due to the obviously fake accent she sports throughout the film.<br/><br/>Writing: Amazing. This is where the movie shines. An ultra-right wing U.K. meets an ultra left-wing terrorist and an innocent woman gets caught up in the middle of it all. Politically charged movies have a tendency to do poorly, but this one hits the nail on the head with excellent scripting and plot development.<br/><br/>Cinematography: This was also very well done, but there is definitely not as much action as one might expect from the makers of the Matrix trilogy. However, the lack of action is made up for with the meaty plot. If a meaty plot isn't enough to make you forgive the lack of action, then this is not the movie for you.<br/><br/>In my honest opinion, this movie deserves not only top 250 on this website, but top 10. I've noticed that many people who did not like this film hated it for political reasons more than anything.

","""V for Vendetta"" recalls elements of George Orwell's novel ""1984"". This film likewise shows a dystopian Britain under a stringent totalitarian government and shares some other themes such as a concern for past events. However, there is one key difference between ""1984"" and this film, ""V"". In ""1984"" there was no force to challenge the primacy of the totalitarian government, but in this film V is a mysterious anti-government terrorist figure that inspires resistance.<br/><br/>The story follows Evey, played by Natalie Portman, as she slowly makes the acquaintance of V. I have never been overly impressed by Natalie Portman's acting, but she gives a decent though not outstanding performance in this film. However, the rest of the cast is excellent. V's mask wearing character is one part action hero and one part over-the-top stagy actor, sometimes delivering rapid-fire dialogue. It makes for an effective combination and Hugo Weaving handles it well. John Hurt is well-cast as the leader of the totalitarian government in a reversal of his role as the repressed Winston Smith in the 1984 film of ""1984"". There are also excellent performances from Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry.<br/><br/>This film's primary strength is its intriguing story developed around exploring repression and propaganda from the totalitarian government, opposition to the government and the mysteries concerning the enigmatic V. Like in many films showing dystopia, the setting is appropriately mostly dingy and gloomy. Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture"" was used great effect to accompany some of V's anti-government activities. Some will be averse to the way the film mixes overtly dramatic elements such as V's acting and the displays accompanied by the ""1812 Overture"" with dystopia, but for me the film managed to make the combination effective and interesting."
"The_StarWolf","9","2","7","15 September 2007"," Close to perfect
","The only reason I gave it a ""9"" is that perfection (implied by a ""10"") is a physical impossibility. Otherwise, this film would rate it. It discards the plot-stopping padding elements of the comics while retaining the key points and character facets which made the comic such a successful, thought-provoking work. The sad part being, those who desperately need to see this - to set THEM thinking - probably won't.<br/><br/>One thing, however, in the ""synopsis"" section someone wrote that V's name is ""Rockwood"" or some such. It isn't. That was a cover name - belonging to a man long dead - used to draw Inspector Finch to him. One of the side effects of the treatment at Larkhill was to erase much of V's memory.

","Possibly the most under-rated movie ever!!!<br/><br/>Wow, this movie is fantastic. I went to this film thinking that it was going to be a sub par action flick in the vein of The Matrix, boy, was I surprised. It has an engaging and deep plot. It has amazing action and special effects. Very well choreographed fight scenes. Oscar worthy acting performances, especially from Hugo Weaving. Ingenious use of a classic Tchaikovsky piece. Emotionally charged and shockingly realistic. One of the coolest costumes I have ever seen as well as the look of the whole film (Kudos to the art director). And most of all the dialogue was brilliant. V's opening alliteration was beyond fantastic. <br/><br/>I don't see why this movie didn't win: Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best actor. <br/><br/>I give V a big X."

I recommend this unique, amazing, peace of film-making at it's best, for everyone who reads this. Many scenes in the film were very, very awesome, and Hugo Weaving does a awesome job with his acting in this film. Many films have passed me and the critics all say the same thing on the cover of the film, and every single time i watch those movies they never are enough, but this movie had everything. I believe this movie deserved an Academy Award, for any subject, because this film has it all, action, the right kind of drama, sci-fi action, with unforgettable acting, and characters for a decade of films."
"Heorot","8","2","7","26 April 2007"," Entertainment, warning and wake-up call
","Having just seen this cinematic extravaganza, I am compelled to comment on it. I was especially moved by the crowd that gathered to march on Parliament. People banding together because each and every one person believes that what he or she is doing is right(!) does tend to move any one watching, such as I. What Evy underwent at the hands of V may strike many as going too far. It was however, in the conviction of V, the only way he knew to set her free from her fears. And that strikes right back at a central issue of the film , which is that fear can control you, and hold you silent when you should not be. Justice is not a building, but an idea, that lives in the hearts of men and women. And that has much to do with what V tells us in the beginning of the movie: ""People shouldn't be afraid of their governments; the government should be afraid of the people."" The film is full of ideas; is V the flesh under his mask? should we be allowed to make fun of authority figures? should anyone have to suffer injustice? The movie was very stylish and true to the feeling of its parent, the comic, while at the same time being an enthralling movie. It was not perfect; the birth of V, due to medical experiments to create a virus, is weak to say the least. The total story of ruthless men who used a biological weapon to gain control of an election is not. It may seem unlikely, but so many events do, in the political games we see played from afar, all over the world. An entertainment, a word of warning, and a wake-up call."
"MLDinTN","5","2","7","6 March 2007"," makes you think,,,
","but still was V supposed to have superhuman powers. My view is, was V supposed to be a super hero or an average joe. He gets shot at and survives. Can knock down doors with no problems. Can sling knives with ease. We see him in flashbacks walking through fire and he survived some kind of experimental testing with a virus. So, did the virus testing make him have super powers. It just didn't make sense in spots.<br/><br/>Plus, why would Evie come back to V after he tortured her and kept her in a tiny dark room for months. She thanks him for that. Once again, didn't make a whole lot of sense. And I can't believe Natalie Portman shaved her head for that role. It's not like it was some kind of ground breaking performance.<br/><br/>I thought the story trying to be told was too much for a two hour movie. It would have made a lot more sense if it was filmed as a 12 hour HBO series. Too much happens with the plot and it just gets confusing.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I didn't think it is worth watching. The story isn't well put together."
"Nuintincowen","3","2","7","26 July 2006"," Not as amazing as all the hype has made it out to be
","I came into V for Vendetta with high expectations...and was sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>The premise for the overall film sounded incredibly interesting, and the idea of a rogue anti-hero such as V was also interesting. As I watched, I was thoroughly entertained, as the acting was superb (thank god we have Natalie Portman away from the horrible dialog she was force-fed in Star Wars). The special effects were also amazing, and never once did I think that any of the events weren't possible (the action, that is).<br/><br/>But then...the film turned political on me. I came to be entertained, but I was met with political propaganda, ironically enough. The clear pro-gay, anti-republican was disappointing, as this isn't why I came to the movies. I don't like either mindset, but I'm perfectly willing to accept it...when filmmakers aren't injecting their own opinions into a masterpiece people from all backgrounds will view.<br/><br/>-!-!-!-!-!-!-SPOILERS AHEAD-!-!-!-!-!-!- And then there was the inevitable romance between Evey and V. Oh, please. I will not hesitate to being a hopeless romantic...when it's believable. I felt as though the filmmakers just wanted to appeal to a female audience, so they threw a highly unlikely romance into the mix. V tortured and psychologically tormented Evey...yet she suddenly loves him? I'll admit it could be possible...over time. Yet one instant, she was being shaved bald, crying her eyes out and living in total despair, the next she's bidding him a tearful goodbye whilst kissing his mask (which was incredibly laughable, as well).<br/><br/>In the end, I'm surprised that this film has such a high rating. There are much more superior films out there worthy of an 8.2 - this, unfortunately, is not it."
"paterfam001","4","2","7","7 April 2006"," Like masturbation: it's fun, but what's it for?
","I gave this movie a low rating, 4, despite the fact that I quite enjoyed it while it was going on. I would rate it at least a 7 if I hadn't found it, in the end, morally objectionable. In the end it is a nihilist production (very like 'The Matrix', come to think of it) which exists to damp down and defuse all thoughts of current politics and political action in the minds of those who watch it.<br/><br/>If the message of the movie had been: 'This is what things may come to if you don't guard Democracy with vigilance,' I might have looked on it more favorably. But the movie's message in fact is, 'We haven't got a prayer unless a super-human hero arises to lead us.' This was the Nazis' message, once, the basis of one of the most grandiose oppressions that the world has ever know.<br/><br/>Politics day-to-day is kind of a dull business. Like the laying of sewer-pipes, it is necessary, but unglamorous. You could certainly make a good movie about it, but its box-office would be small. The only way the media seem to be able to deal with it is by way of farce ('Spin City' and 'Where's my Bush') where the main point is, our leaders are idiots. But the dullness of politics is discouragement enough: please don't make movies that discourage us further, in the name of entertainment. Are you listening, Brothers Wachewski? At least the farce points out a current problem with a current solution: if our leaders are idiots, let's vote them out. If all available candidates are idiots, or worse, let's go deeper into politics and campaign for good men and women. A hero saving the people of the future from their oppressors is very much like a porn-film. It's politics without action, like porn is sex without love or relation. Both are masturbation."

The Wachowski brothers simply raped this story of all its glory. I mean first off it's not an action comic, anyone who has read Alan Moore's work knows that he doesn't get down that way. I mean we get a wonderful adaptation of Sin City and Spider-Man so we comic fans feel like nothing can go wrong with a comic movie as high profile as V, but then the Wachowski brothers get their hands on it. They simply missed when they made V take out the Old Bailey first instead of Parliament, YES in the comic parliament is the first to go. Let's just hope if Hollywood ever decides to get it together for Watchmen they do not allow the Wachowski brothers to butcher another piece of art like they have done with V for Vendetta."

","For the first half-hour the movie establishes a precedent to which it never lives up. By the time the movie is over you feel like either you were just manipulated into sitting through some political propaganda film based on the current social woes of our modern society or that you were ripped off by paying for a movie with a bad story. The acting is not bad but it would have been better served with a concise and more direct approach to an ending that means to say that the only way our present society will survive in the future is through tolerance and understanding of those people who are gay and non-Christian. The whole movie is set with antagonists who represent a totalitarian evil government that use and corrupt ""faith"" as a means for justifying their intolerant and corrupt gestapo-like forms of rule and order, much the same way that Stalin, Lenin, and, of course, Hitler, used their corrupt beliefs to establish a perverted form of government. In the first third of the movie this premise works well and makes the movie seem believable and directed with a sense of justifiable political acumen intertwined with an entertaining action-packed and emotion-evoking storyline. Soon, however, Natalie Portman is put through a forceful and deliberate change in her perspective which enables her character to understand and believe in the anarchistic development that the titular character, ""V"", is advocating to promote HIS form of tolerance and understanding. It's my opinion that the plot is all quite convoluted and often plain stupid after these scenes--very overly dramatic and laughable. Check it out if you want a window of understanding for those people who feel oppressed and are tired of whining and so they must create anarchy. You'll get some good laughs at the ridiculousness of it all. The demographic profiles for this movie will tell you that the only reason this movie received a high rating is because the majority of the voters are young adults, who have impressionable minds and are anti-establishment wherever they go."

This most vital aspect of the story was just never fully realized or revealed, and that's a must! I really wanted to see ""V""'s real face so i could identify with who the character is now and not who he used to be, which as i said, is never fully explored.

","I was expecting a very interesting afternoon at the movies after a friend of mine recommended this one to me, saying that she had been nearly on her feet and cheering at the end. Well, she and I have very different tastes, alas. I understand how V's mask plays an important role in the graphic novel, but on screen, honestly, it's just annoying, and it limited Hugo Weaving's acting so much that I'm surprised he merited a screen credit (sorry Hugo). Perhaps the Orwellian England where the story takes place is more interesting for those who haven't read Orwell. One thing that was very interesting to me, though, was the perspective on London's famous public camera scrutiny. I've always wondered what sort of end result that social experiment would have. Now we know - the subway bombers got caught and ""V"" got launched. Maybe I'm just an old fogy -- I did like the Matrix, though."
"pandapeep","4","2","7","20 March 2006"," A flawed translation
","V for Vendetta is a challenging, dark, frighting story, especially in this day and age. It asks difficult questions: When is it OK to become a terrorist? Is terrorist always a bad thing? Or can it be used for change? For that matter, is it ever justified? And, like any good story, it doesn't attempt to give you answers.<br/><br/>Now, being a comic book geek, a huge fan of Allan Moore's, and having recently read the comic book, my opinion is skewed, I will admit. I had difficulty removing myself from the context of the comic. But, this does mean that, had I not read the comic, I would have missed the flaws in this film.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is not a love story, despite what the Matrix brothers would have you believe. Apperiently, they think that an American audience would not take a story about an insane, anarchist, terrorist and watch it. So, they humanized him. In the book, it is V who throws Evey out of the Shadow Gallery, where as in the movie, she betrays him and runs. This serves to depower V. Here he is not the one in power of his interaction with Evey, no, she is in control. Later, as V lays dying on the subway floor, V tells Evey he loves her. By humanizing V, he becomes palatable, human, a good guy. No longer is his ambiguity up in the air. No, he is clearly good, as he loves.<br/><br/>I could go on, but I will not bore you. This film is a disappointment, if because it had flashes of utter brilliance. This could have been a film worth remembering years from now, a film worthy of being stored in a ""Shadow Gallery,"" even. A movie that could incite A debate for years to come. As it stands, it will ruffle a few feathers, get some press, maybe have a senator or two complain, and then drift away, noiselessly. In two years, no one will remember this movie, and it will nary be spoke of. V would be disappointed."
"KoKolopedia","10","2","7","18 March 2006"," Action - not too much. Just Right.
","Overall the movie has left me feeling like I received my money's worth. You'll notice a previous review that mentions how - different from the Matrix - V for Vendetta seeks to focus more on the plot as opposed to the action.<br/><br/>In this film, you'll get a great sense of appreciation from the storyline as it is well detailed and drawn out. Nothing about the plot feels too long or superfluous as some movies tend to be these days. The acting is of high quality and Hugo Weaving gives a wonderful performance, as does Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>The action is very well timed and not too unbelievable. There's almost the perfect amount of action in this film to make it so that you aren't left wanting more, but also aren't left feeling like action was all the movie had to offer.<br/><br/>The storyline is definitely what makes the movie what it is, so if you're going into this movie thinking that it's going to be non-stop action, explosions, or fighting, it'd be a good idea to become aware of the fact that you won't be sitting through another Matrix. However, if you want to be treated with a great philosophical and politically inspired plot with great action to back it, buy a ticket, have a seat, and enjoy the show."
"dfranzen70","7","2","7","18 March 2006"," Slick, but still chaotic
","The Wachowski Brothers' stab at stylistic sociopolitical commentary is visually arresting, compelling stuff, a fine homage to its graphic novel source. It's artful, if perhaps missing a dash or a smidge of subtlety, but not so much that one is entirely distracted from the somewhat pedestrian, familiar plot.<br/><br/>V is a vigilante, a lone avenger who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and wants to extol the masses of a somewhat-futuristic London to rise up against their oppressors, throw off the yoke of totalitarianism, and watch their favorite buildings explode.<br/><br/>It's the near future. Britain no longer has a queen or prime minister; instead, it has a chancellor, an ominous man named Setler (John Hurt) who appears on giant TV screens, a la Big Brother. And freedoms have been seriously curtailed, especially free speech, owing to three terrorist incidents in which nearly 100,000 people die. This leads to state-controlled media, secret police, and so-called black baggers, the men who come in the middle of the night to round up people deemed Bad by the government.<br/><br/>When a young Londoner named Evey (Natalie Portman) is caught out after a state-imposed curfew by the secret police and is then attacked by said defenders of the realm, a debonair, eloquent masked marvel springs to her aid, dispatching with her aggressors with all due speed. He quotes Shakespeare and looks like a Musketeer, complete with swirling black cape and superpointy blades, but wears a portentous mask - that of noted British rebel/hero Guy Fawkes, who once tried to blow up Parliament some 400 years ago. The mysterious man rescues Evey and spirits her away to his secret lair. Later, he shows her part of his plans as a famed statue detonates.<br/><br/>""You can call me V,"" the man says, and although the letter stands for Vendetta in the title, it's also a good stand in for Vengeance, Vituperation, and Vanquishment. Clearly, V is harboring some kind of grudge on someone, and he's going to try to turn the country upside down, show the populace how corrupt and Fascist their government - which they've elected - has become. He's an anarchist at his heart, it seems, but could there also be a more personal vendetta rampaging in his mind? V sees Evey as a necessary ally and enlists her in his cause, an entreaty she accepts. But is she willing to go as far as V is? From the scared-kitten look on Portman's face through much of the movie, one would assume she's not quite sure she's made the right choice.<br/><br/>At times, the movie is very powerful propaganda, demanding that the viewer draw parallels between the celluloid events and those occurring in the real world today. But it's not heavy handed in its execution; everything that we see on screen is quite plausible, at least in the context of the fictional futuristic London.<br/><br/>There are some similarities between this film and the Matrix series, also by the Wachowskis, including the overall look and feel of the set designs and the idea that we're all being controlled by someone or something else. But unlike The Matrix, V for Vendetta isn't terribly deep of a movie; it's not a movie that invites endless philosophical discussions about Who We Are and Why We're Here. We know just enough for the sake of the movie, and we're not left wanting to know more. There aren't many twists, nothing to keep your brain hopping along, always wondering what might come next.<br/><br/>There IS one big twist, however. Some viewers might think of it as a shaggy-dog outcome, though, and others might completely buy into it. It's the kind of twist that may well make you scratch your head and wonder if the actions in the twist were really all that necessary - the old ends-justifies-the-means adage.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving, so wonderful as Agent Smith in the Matrix movies, plays V, and although we never once get to see Mr. Weaving's face, he turns in a powerful, commanding performance. You can feel what V feels, and without the crutch of a countenance on which to make expressions, this is fantastic acting indeed. Portman is okay as Evey, but her character wasn't sufficiently substantive, which is my way of saying I don't think it was Portman's fault. I think she did an admirable job considering what she had to work with; in this movie, Evey is relegated to less-than-sidekick status.<br/><br/>And I would be remiss if I did not add that the final scene is both satisfying and unsatisfying, which makes it a little frustrating. Part of it grabbed my heart and made it soar, but part also did seem a tad expected.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is, at times, invigorating, exciting, revolutionary, and terrifying, but it's a little slicker than its subject material should indicate."

The film is fantastic, and it's message is timeless. However if he were commenting on his own life, the statement would be true.<br/><br/>Jonathan Ross was paid £5,000,000 a year by the BBC (nationalised) at the time of the comment - so his anti-V quote comes as no surprise to me.<br/><br/>He would probably be frowned upon if he didn't take his money and do whatever the British Government demanded of him.<br/><br/>No doubt the government contacted the BBC and demanded that Ross describe the film as a failure, or ""pro-terrorist"" - to try and stop more people learning it's message and standing up to the corruption to come in the future.<br/><br/>The film isn't even remotely pro-terrorist. It simply outlines the main problem we have in the world today - Government corruption, running rampant with our freedoms.<br/><br/>The message of the film is timeless, and the most important message of our time.<br/><br/>Today in the western world propaganda and surveillance are running rampant.<br/><br/>We describe an uncountable number of humans in the Middle-East as ""terrorists"" - while Western Armies murder hundreds of innocent civilians every day on average in a war that has no reason to exist other than profit for a small group of people at the top of the pyramid.<br/><br/>I can only hope this film is seen by all freedom loving human beings everywhere - so our future can be rid of the disgusting corruption running throughout our entire civilisation.<br/><br/>To finish I will say it was a pleasure to see John Hurt in another political role. Since I saw 1984 I have nothing but respect for the man and what he believes in.<br/><br/>It was a pleasure to see him helping out yet again - bringing the most important message of our time to the world in yet another brilliant film.<br/><br/>""People should not fear their government.<br/><br/>The government should fear it's people."" - V<br/><br/>10/10"

This movie encompassed all the greatest points of George Orwell's 1984 in a much more realistic (and FAR scarier) scenario. In short, the scene at the end, with everyone removing their masks, was a work of art on it's own.

Should my government grow out of control (it's bad, I know, but it's not THIS bad) I feel like the lessons I learned by watching this movie would grant me the strength to stand up for what I know is right. V for Vendetta changed my life. Every year since it's release I have celebrated the fifth of November, and will continue to do so for the rest of my life.

","Whats there not to like about this movie? It has everything a great movie should have and more!<br/><br/>First off, there was a perfect cast. Natalie Portman was the perfect choice to play Evey Hammond, I don't think any other actress could have even come close to filling the part as Natalie did. She didn't even seem to be acting as much as living the role of Evey. Then there's Hugo Weaving. First off, I must say that I did not have confidence in Weaving to play as part such as V, but I was proved wrong. Weaving gave an award-winning performance as V; who is on my personal list of ""Best Movie Characters"". We also have Stephen Rea, who pulled off the part of the determined, curious Inspector Eric Finch very well. Finch is one of those characters who is with the bad guy but you still root for him. There's also Stephen Fry, whose character, Gordon Dietrich, brought a lot of color to the movie with his jokes and values. John Hurt gave a surprisingly excellent performance as Chancellor Adam Sutler also. The rest of the cast was very good as well but if I take the time to name each one, we'll be here all night.<br/><br/>Aside from having a perfect cast, this movie has the privilege of having one of the best plots I've seen in years. The concept is similar to 1984, but also bears quite a resemblance to the Nazi Regime before WWII. Basically, this is a futuristic, British version of Nazi Germany. Except here, we have V who plans to take down the government through the people.<br/><br/>Along with a great story and characters is a good music score. A lot of classical music was used here and goes with the mood quite well.<br/><br/>The special FX were Grade A. Not just because they were great either, but because they weren't overused as a lot of movies tend to do.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I guarantee you'll enjoy it. <br/><br/>10/10."

Further, the main message of the movie was that we should watch out for ""christian anti-gay and anti-Muslim governments"" pleeeaaassseee. The main threats to peace in this world are indeed islam, china, Russia, Iran, north Korea, and the middle east. Not a guy who loves Jesus. This ultra-political movie was junk. It seems that the right wing is an easy target which makes me realize that thats why its bullcrap when we see them as the political threat. This movie takes the easy route, for budgetary reasons. The fact that movies aren't made that are critical of islam or china or the left tells me that those things are the threats. Hollywood is afraid of Muslims as are most Americans, so we attack easy targets and turn the truth into lies. This movie is garbage."

"Electrified_Voltage","10","3","14","26 March 2009"," A gem of modern cinema, with a strong script and cast!
","After the two ""Matrix"" sequels disappointed many fans of the original 1999 blockbuster, Andy and Larry Wachowski, the ""Matrix"" creators, wrote the screenplay for this film, ""V for Vendetta"". Released in 2005, this political sci-fi action thriller turned out to be another hit for the brothers. Even though I first saw ""The Matrix"" in 2000, the year after its release, and saw both sequels on the silver screen in 2003, I was totally unaware of this follow-up back when it came into theatres. Although I did come across this film on IMDb sometime within the past three years, it didn't quite catch my attention until this month. Knowing how well received it was, I had high expectations, and now that I've seen it, I certainly can't question its popularity! <br/><br/>In the not so distant future, Britain has become a totalitarian society, filled with injustice and prejudice! Evey is a young woman in this society who is out after curfew one night, and is accosted by two government thugs. She is rescued by a mysterious man in a Guy Fawkes mask, a man only known as ""V""! He is a rebel against the country's current oppressive government, and before Evey goes home, he takes her to witness his destruction of the Old Bailey! The next day, V takes over government-controlled airwaves, encourages the public to rise up against their totalitarian government, and announces his plans to destroy the Houses of Parliament next year on the fifth of November, just like Guy Fawkes tried to do in 1605! Evey has now come into V's world, and the government knows who she is, the daughter of two executed political activists! She will have to keep a low profile as she sometimes wonders weather she should be on V's side or not, and gradually learns about his past and his thirst for revenge! <br/><br/>The film starts with an intense opening sequence, set in 1605, when Guy Fawkes attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament. This sequence features an excellent opening narration. Yes, this is an action movie, but unlike some films of this type, this one is not all for the sake of action, and it seems they were careful to make a decent script, with some impressive dialogue. Yes, there's also a lot of suspense in the story (since it's an action flick, that's obviously a good thing), and a number of moving scenes as well. There's also a bit of humour in the film, which doesn't hurt it. It helps that the cast is also strong. Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving in the two main roles (Evey and V) didn't let me down, and another notable performance is definitely John Hurt as Adam Sutler, the mean-spirited chancellor! I would say basically all the characters are portrayed well, except maybe for the creepy, perverted priest.<br/><br/>Despite its popularity, this 2005 blockbuster is one that could disturb many people. It's rated R for a reason, due to the violence and blood, and it also contains controversial content, which some would view as intelligent and some would view as naive. I'm sure some people think the exact opposite of everything I've praised this film for, but every film has its haters, no matter how widely praised it may be. Despite the critics of ""V for Vendetta"", many of whom I'm sure have good reasons for their criticisms, I'm joining the many people who have rated this film 10/10. It's in the same genre as the last movie I saw before this, ""I, Robot"", a sci-fi action thriller, but it's definitely superior. I haven't read the graphic novel which this movie is based on, but watching this movie was still one memorable experience! Don't expect this movie to be exactly like ""The Matrix"", (one difference is that it certainly doesn't have as many special effects), but if you like sci-fi and/or action, and you want a suspenseful and emotional story, this one just might blow you away!"

","If you're an Anglican conservative in the pharmacy field in England, this isn't the movie for you. Basically the movie is racists against Christians and showing how Christians like to kill gays/lesbians and anyone who don't agree with them - not to mention all the atheist dictators we had doing that in the 20th century. Terribly movie, it was the most political one I have ever saw. Did not enjoy it, the theory behind the movie is warped and flawed. Go find another group of people to pick on beside Christians. The whole idea that Anglicans like to gas children at St. Mary's to test a chemical so their pharmaceutical company can have exclusive rights on the cure is bogus. This movie is surely anti-capitalism too."

","This is my all-time best movie. I have quite seen quite a lot of other top movies and well known movies but never have i been more inspired and amazed. This is one to remember for your life.<br/><br/>When i first saw this movie back when it was released i was completely blown away it. But a lot of my friends didn't appreciate the movie. They really couldn't connect with the movie well nor could appreciate the effects of name-sake democratic government. It truly highlights what modern government have become. During olden days there were a lot of social problems, people didn't have proper food/shelter/clothes. Back then, politicians used to be determined by that scale, the politician who could better solve that crisis for the people became popular and get elected. As time progressed and the economy developed politicians need some other items to hinge upon for votes. So they added *fear*.<br/><br/>Just like what the movie says we are just keeping our mouth shut to the atrocities committed in the name of security using our fear. It starts with some minimal video surveillance and then slowly becomes complete control for the government. And when you have one wrong person sitting at the top of the government this is what happens. This movie is an excellent into how the future might be, not technologically but socially. Unlike other movies set in future, this one does not try to show you fancy gadgets for the future, it just shows how the future society might be.<br/><br/>When we come to actual movie, its brilliant. Weaving is excellent in his role as V, his voice was brilliant for this character, clear and precise. I was honestly surprised by portman's acting, she did really well as a young scared woman.<br/><br/>I own this DVD, and i have seen it several times. And every time i loved this movie. And i still keep watching it every once in a while."

","Starting out a little slow, and not really knowing what direction the film is going to take you, you're left at the mercy of the characters: a man in a mask, and a young girl whose innocence is her greatest asset. But the ride you're taken on is futuristic and intriguing. While it's difficult to trust a fellow who's (almost) always in disguise (as if he's hiding something sinister), your innocence, the girl's innocence, and the reporter/detective's innocence all lead you to a conclusion: government unchallenged is government out-of-control. An underlying theme is that we are ""victims of our fears"": we want the security, but not the control of an aristocratic ""big brother"". It can never really be that way - we will always eventually revolt when the crimes are uncovered."
"film-critic","6","2","8","31 May 2009"," Chapter 11: Valhalla
","""V for Vendetta"" is more than just a masked terrorist running amok in a futuristic Britain; it is more than just the quick wits of an anti-hero challenging the government; and it is far more than just the follow-up film from the Wachowski brothers. This is a philosophical cinematic entry disguised as a blockbuster. While most will argue that it is a poor excuse for the graphic novel (and slightly I agree) because it doesn't follow the story frame by frame, the themes are still pulled through. Looking back into the graphic novel, the changes made from page to screen were dramatic, yet bold. The ""happy"" ending in the film gives way to the more dismal, slightly uplifting ending in the graphic novel. The main difference between the two is the lack of grittiness, one could call it realism, found within the story and missing in the film. ""V for Vendetta"" the film is beautiful, watched in full HD, the sound, visuals, and colors are exactly the opposite from the graphic novel, and while comparing the two is not the extent of this review, it is an element that needs to be considered. Alan Moore took his name off this film, reading the graphic novel will explain why.<br/><br/>With that said, what worked and was miscalculated in the film? To begin, the Wachowskis coupled with the direction of director James McTeigue captured the visual of ""V"" perfectly. The mask was chilling, and the darkened question of his origins remained open-ended. Their depiction of this masked vigilante was brilliant. The way the shadows fell, the camera angles on his face instilled both fear and excitement for this character. ""V"", with this film, became iconic. Alas, the visual alone couldn't counter what preceded ""V"". The use of Hugo Weaving's voice was, like Natalie Portman's accent, weak. ""V"" was a bold character, but when he spoke, he seemed weaker and in less control. Weaving's voice-work didn't capture the intensity that surrounds this character – and then there was Portman. While she brought some innocence to the character of Eve (a name symbolic as well as poignant), the fading British accent continued the idea that she was merely Natalie Portman playing a character, not just Eve incarnate. Stephen Rae was superb in his role, as always, as the tamed cop hunting for a belief he struggles with, and John Hurt was completely over the top, applauding his role as evil as outstanding. These secondary characters, proving their might stronger than the primary ones, added much needed relief to this film, but it didn't make it perfect.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" is a great film to sit down and enjoy two hours of crisp visuals, amazing music (look for a beautiful cover by ""Cat Power""), and intense ideals. It is a thinking film. It camouflages itself as a big-budget action/adventure film, but all the while it is asking to you see the modern news and question our governments. It will keep your mind occupied for hours. McTeigue did a great job of bringing modern relevance (still tragic today) into this film to create a timeless sensation, but it still doesn't counter the disappointing acting. As mentioned before, what makes ""V for Vendetta"" the graphic novel work is our characters, and as they lacked in the film – it moved it in a different direction. Without the graphic novel, this film still works as entertainment, and slight thought – but it isn't a complete masterpiece. I enjoyed this film when it was first released on the big screen, but watching it today – the small nuances with the characters just don't hold up well over time. Its message is in tact, but lacks the body.<br/><br/>Grade: *** out of *****"

","The purpose of a movie review is really to offer advice on whether the reader should use 2 hours of their time to experience it.

After that, until this movie, I thought that the brothers were a one-hit-wonder.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is unconventional. If you are one that can appreciate subtlety, depth, and a powerful story driven by well-written, intelligently created characters, this is an amazing work.<br/><br/>I do not know if it remains faithful to the original comic, as I have never read a comic in my life, but this is as close to a reason to begin as I've ever seen."

This mystery guy known as V really touches on a lot of issues and some of the things he did that would normally seem wrong in a way almost conflicts and suddenly you understand why he does what he does and it teaches you not to think in black and white but rather to see the Grey in the middle, life is not that simple and he helps the girl he kidnaps understand that.

","A master piece from Wachowski Brothers. I am really at the dearth of words to explain how delighted and excited am feeling right now just after completing this movie. Actually i started watching it last night but as the turn of events would have it, before completed even half of it, i had to rush to the office (for the night shift of course). But, by that time, i was so hooked to it that all night i kept thinking about it. And after coming back home today morning, despite feeling tired and worn out due to lack of sleep, i couldn't resist myself from the temptation of completing the movie.<br/><br/>Man...wot a wonderful work! Its truly a piece of extreme imagination and artistry. The most exquisite portrait of a blend of human evil and good. And the most amazing part is that after completing this wonderful journey of a little more than 2 hours although u would remember the characters...the thing that will cling onto your conscious is the IDEA. An IDEA that how an IDEA can bring a revolution, an unstoppable tide of change that can bring down the ages long monarchy and embark the whole society on to the path of new direction...<br/><br/>So wonderfully carved out is the Character 'V' that it just leaves you speechless. He is no hero yet He is. He is no Evil yet He is. At first, what acts of him appear as that full of utter hatred and vengeance slowly start taking the shape of Chivalrous Plans of defiance against a system based on the Greed of power and dominance over people ripping them of the very basic trait of human society...FREEDOM.<br/><br/>And here comes our hero and starts off his job of freeing the people in a most unpredictable manner. And what should i say to define the minutely carved details of his personae... I am finding it hard to put together words. The ever clung Mask of 'V' of course adores him with a veil of mystery and an awe generally reserved for Horrifying characters but there is much more to it than that. I think its giving the impression that whatever 'V' is doing, he is enjoying it and once...the people knows the truth and understands his idea..they see a hope in his smile. All the more, it clearly hides away all the pain, agony and torture he himself has gone through to become what he is. Although, i was curious through the start, by the end of the movie i wasn't bothered to know who actually was behind that Mask. The character 'V' had outgrown everything.<br/><br/>The dialogs give the killer punch. If each good line in the movie is bestowed to be gem, it will be a hell of a necklace. Listening to the words as they are spoken, you are completely lost in the track of time and find yourselves in times of the movie. To mark my words, you need to listen to the first self introduction of 'V' to Natalie portman. It completely succeeds in pulling you out of you.<br/><br/>No less remarkable is the direction and screenplay... Especially the Climax. Its amazing. Simply amazing. Now there is a movie which has moved me in many a time.<br/><br/>Hats off to Wachowski Brothers for pulling off a really brilliant piece of art.<br/><br/>I think i have said way too much...maybe because i am overawed by the magnificence of this Celluloid Miracle.<br/><br/>The least i should have and would like to say is that IT IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER WATCHED."

","There are few times when I ever pronounce a movie so exemplary that I'm willing to see it more than once in a blue moon, and this is one of those times. V for Vendetta was a masterpiece of art, interwoven with symbolism, history, and ideology to create a mesh of cinematic artwork which surpasses anything the Shadow Gallery may have to offer.<br/><br/>The movie's premise is relatively simple. Driven out of fear and madness, the populace of Great Britain elects a political party into power known as Norsefire following a series of terrorist attacks which were, unbeknownst to them, orchestrated by their own government. The religious fundamentalist government proceeds to cull ""undesirables"", such as homosexuals, Muslims, and cripples, and installs a totalitarian dictatorship in place free of political dissent. A lone man known as V arises out of the ashes of the cullings and plants the seed of revolution in the people, out of revenge.<br/><br/>V's character, played by Hugo Weaving, is enigmatic and yet surprisingly eloquent for a man with a mask. As Evey said, ""You cannot kiss an idea"", but V in himself exists as an idea - revolution - which inspires an oppressed people out of apathy. Natalie Portman's performance as Evey Hammond is no less brilliant, as she shows her emotions raw and clear.<br/><br/>What sets this movie apart from similar predecessors is its complete deference to the style of the Wachowski brothers, both cinematically and lyrically. Not only is it able to tell a good story, despite taking liberties from the comic book (which in my opinion was far less intriguing than the movie), it is able to put it in a cinematic medium which appeals to the eye and holds in itself a hint of surprise. For the average viewer, it dulls down abstruse concepts into a potent form consumable by your average Joe, and still manages to keep the intellectuals engaged by the interplay of ideas within the film. We are never fully endowed with the true workings of the society or V's mind, much as in the Brothers' previous Matrix films we remain semi ignorant of the societal workings of the machines, and this only peaks our curiosity.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a delight, but I will not say that it is a fleeting one. Watching the movie can be empowering in many ways, and if nothing, it's a treat for the eyes."

I love the Wachowski Brothers. The story was excellent, epic and relevant (not only to Margaret Thatcher England but now and probably for as long as governments exist.) It made me think and i enjoyed it greatly. I especially liked that it focused on the mass opposition to gay equality (which is one of the biggest civil rights absurdities of modern America). It was just a really really good movie based on a really good comic. One of the major criticism by big fans of the original story is that it didn't focus on the concept of ""anarchism"" however i think that was a good move as the ""anarchist movement"" and its principles mean very little to the American public."

"macktan894","9","2","8","24 July 2007"," Took me over a year to finally see it...
","...and then I loved it.<br/><br/>Like Evey initially, I can be reluctant to step out of my comfort zone when it comes to spending a couple of hours watching a film. I'm committed to certain genres and disdain the rest, unwilling to sacrifice a guarantee of pleasure to a moment of risk. But when you watch as many films as I do, eventually you'll have to take a chance on a film that looks suspicious. I found the DVD V among the library at my son's house and packed it in my purse.<br/><br/>The best gifts are the ones you don't expect. This was no fantasy along the lines of a Dragonslayer, but a modern depiction of revolution albeit with touches of Orwell. Grounding the movie were the two leads played by Natalie Portman and the incredible Hugo Weaving who play Evey Hammond, daughter of political parents who died for their actions, and V, the masked man, disfigured in a fire, victim of a Holocaustian event perpetrated by neo-Nazis. Their performances make this movie classic.<br/><br/>I recall reading that Clive Owen, the lead actor in Spike Lee's Inside Man, at first rejected the role because his character was masked for most of the film. In fact, he was to be masked for all of it until Lee gave in and permitted him face time in at least a few scenes. Clive should be ashamed after watching Weaving's entirely masked performance in V. The second time I viewed the film, I paid close attention to Weaving's performance and marveled at how he created a character through voice and movement: the bow of the head, lift of the arms, intonation and body language--all this working together created one of the most memorable characters in film. Like Evey, you eventually find him irresistible...and admirable for his subversive ways.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's character goes through a complete transformation in this firm, from a passive, pretty little thing, fearful always of being caught, just like her parents, to a full-fledged revolutionary willing to commit to her ideals. She was born with the subversive gene, as V detects immediately, but she's spent her life so far suppressing it out of fear. He helps her bring it to life.<br/><br/>As a youngster, I loved the films Zorro, The Lone Ranger, Robin Hood and now we have V. For those who, like me, rarely step out of their comfort zone--try to do so for this film."
"Singh1699","9","2","8","28 June 2007"," A spectacular movie
","This movie was spectacular (and I don't say that too often). The parallels between it and history were well done. We see the parallels to the holocaust, 9/11, the current Bush administration's way of leading and where it may end up if we don't wake up as citizens. This movie also showed the use of fear tactics, as we see in our current government, used to further political goals. The only negative I had about the movie was the loose use of the term 'terrorist'. Although the word is loosely used by our current administration, and maybe this is what they were wanting to depict in this movie. and if that were the case, then it was well done. but I have seen too many movies where the word 'terrorist' is misused so I error to think it was so in this movie as well. All in all a wonderful movie to watch."

As one who reflexively detests ""Message Movies,"" I was worried that I might fall in the later category. I didn't. I thought the political references simply served to drive this dark fairytale. It seems to me that anybody who would take any aspect of this wonderful film at more than face value is missing the point.<br/><br/>This is a wildly romantic tale of love, revenge, and, in an odd way, redemption. It is far more focused on the human condition than it is on anything as petty as the political squabbles of the day. That's a good thing, I think. <br/><br/>The performances were wonderful. Hugo Weaving, despite having his face hidden behind a mask throughout most of the movie was overwhelmingly effective as the tortured V. Weaving conveyed nearly perfectly the curious combination of madness and elegance of this flawed and dangerous but pitiable man. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman's portrayal as the waiflike but mentally strong Evey was also excellent. I also enjoyed the performances of the always good John Hurt, Stephen Rea, and the nearly unrecognizable Tim Pigott-Smith as the detestable Creedy. There were many other memorable performances, too, which are too numerous to recount here.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie was drop dead gorgeous, with scene after scene of arresting color and movement, which not only moved the story but were beautiful to look at. The writing was equally arresting, particularly V's lines. There was a music to his frequent alliteration and recitation of Shakespeare's lines.<br/><br/>I can't remember when I last saw a film that had so much to recommend it and so little to criticize.

","V for Vendetta is the first fun, clever and entertaining political film that I have seen since The Crying Game and The Battle of Algiers. I thought that Hugo Weaving (V) and Natalie Portman (Eve Hammond) gave excellent performances. V is a man on a mission: revenge for the terrible actions of his government against him and enlightenment for the citizens of his world. He takes action and from his actions come the beginning of the ""revolution"". V understands that he must teach his fellow citizens--he teaches through the destruction of symbols: justice has been abandoned in a theocratic-fascist England, and so he destroys the Old Bailey. He encourages their small steps: symbolic actions (the small child spraying a graffiti V, etc.) and anonymous action (the Guy Fawkes outfits for everyone in London). All the while, he carries out his personal acts of revenge. As for Eve, he teaches her through kindness and ruthlessness--he drives away all her fear. He makes her a rebel. The film highlights two acts of rebellion, quiet, but costly, that cost two people their lives--one, Gordon, gets swept up in the ""V mindset"" and forgets about the Fingerman, and commits a revolutionary act (humor as revolution) -- he also wears a mask, he passes as ""straight"" but is a gay man in the frightening world of the Christian fundamentalism; even more important, his courage reminds Evey of her parents, their sacrifice, and now his sacrifice. And finally, Eve draws comfort and courage from the autobiography of a young lesbian, once again, who keeps her integrity . . . Evey finds her own courage and integrity . . . She is willing to die anonymously, in order to preserve V and the ""revolution"". An altogether lovely film."

","I must confess that ""V for Vendetta"" is very special piece of art for me. It stays next to ""The Master and Margarita"", over the ""Neuromancer"" and ""Ender's game"". It's incredible and it moves me deeply. I really liked the trailer and I hoped that it will be miracle and the movie will be as good as comic. It's not. It's still a good movie and it's worth watching, maybe even a few times. I don't understand why they couldn't cut all the subplots and leave rest untouched. Why they had to add all those funny things (first scene with V, V in kitchen)?. Why add those details about V's abilities? Why this ridiculous friend of Evey and his show? Why they were in love?I don't know. What I really liked, and found it nice additions are Evey treason and comments about USA :)"

","This film is flexible. No, perhaps the word is versatile. ""V for Vendetta"" just may be the one film from 2006 that has the most varied interpretations, the one film that will stir more thought and debate than any other. It is so much more than the typical comic-book / graphic-novel big screen adaptations that over-populate the cineplexes and rental chain shelves. This one has ideas... Pertinent and timely ideas written by and for a complex mind.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" was on a short-list of about two-dozen films that I was most excited to see in this calendar year. In any given year, I am delighted when half of those anticipated hopefuls turn out to be cinematic gems. This is one of those to treasure. It is thrilling... entertaining while it offers new avenues of thought. It keeps the engine in constant motion while still delivering dialogue that waxes poetic about the nature of government, art, revolution, rebellion, fear, terror, war, trust & courage.<br/><br/>I must admit that, going in, I wasn't sure that this film was going to live up to its lofty goals and incredible advanced buzz. I mean, how often does any film deliver on such... let alone one with a lead character sporting a mask? Somehow though, ""V"" compels us to compare, to judge and to answer the questions it poses. And it does it with a flare and grandeur that will make you edge closer to the screen, if only to immerse yourself further.<br/><br/>The film is hard to describe with a standard plot recap. The film and the characters evolve, constantly changing the starting line... So where to begin? V (Hugo Weaving) is the codename for a masked and cloaked man hell-bent on being noticed by the people and by the government. He practices vigilante justice, whether rescuing a damsel in distress on the future streets of London, blowing up a governmental building, or killing off those who wronged him in the past. Depending on your point of view, he is either a revolutionary or a terrorist.<br/><br/>Evey (Natalie Portman) is said damsel in distress, rescued by V when she breaks curfew and runs into an unseemly band of law enforcement agents. The two of them are bound together by circumstance and ideas. There is an undeniable connection of fate between the two.<br/><br/>The plot is counting down to ""Remember, remember, the 5th of November"", a reference to Guy Fawkes' attempt to blow up the houses of parliament some 400 years earlier. On the next anniversary of that date, V has vowed to exact his vengeance by finishing the act thwarted all that time ago.<br/><br/>The overpowering government rouses into motion its police state tactics to seek out this man before his plan can take root in the consciousness of the people.<br/><br/>The similarities and references to our time, our government and our current world climate will not go unnoticed by any but the thickest dullards. It is quite obvious why this film is being made now. There are clearly messages to be heard here. Some may say the graphic novel could not have been about that, as it was written solely with references to the Nazi party... and was merely forewarning of the dangers imposed by 'Thatcherism' and the like.<br/><br/>That may be true. But this film was made and released at this time with direct references to the war in Iraq, the hideous nature of the Patriot Act, the torture and murder of civilians, the hunger for power and control by the use of fear, the idea that government may not always be on our side... all of these themes and many others point an accusing finger directly at you know who.<br/><br/>There is only one performance in the film that I'd like to highlight... that of Natalie Portman. The rest of the cast is adequate. V's is hard to judge because of the mask, although Weaving is tremendous at delivering the lines with conviction. I mentioned earlier in the review that there was a short-list of films in 2006 that most intrigued me. That list includes 4 films starring Portman, who has overcome the rather embarrassing inclusion in the disappointing Star Wars debacles to emerge clean on the other side with a sublime résumé for any actress, let alone a 24 year-old one.<br/><br/>The four films she has coming out this year are ""Goya's Ghosts"", ""Paris, je t'aime"", ""Free Zone"" and, of course, ""V for Vendetta"". I urge you all to seek those films out because she has already proved to me that she can command the screen with emotion so raw and intense that it never fails to transpose itself to me in the audience.<br/><br/>In this film, despite bouncing back and forth with the English accent, from lower-class yob to upper-class royalty, she is able to become the sympathetic vehicle the audience needs in order to undergo the same transformation that Evey experiences. The best lines in the film are delivered by Hugo Weaving's V... the best reactions and emotions are delivered by this simply brilliant young actress. There are less than a dozen actors or directors whose films I refuse to miss on opening day. Portman has earned her way onto that list.<br/><br/>This film is about ideas. Granted, they aren't new ideas, but they are ideas that we need reminding of in times like these. Like the lead characters in the film, I have hope that enough people will eventually grasp on to those ideas and make the changes necessary in order for us to shed our fear, seek out the truth and reclaim the freedom to choose our own destiny.<br/><br/>""Remember, Remember, the 11th of September!"""

","... gunpowder, treason and plot. I see no reason for the gunpowder treason to ever be forgot.<br/><br/>This film, to be quite frank, restored my faith in the Wachowskis. I didn't see the first Matrix film on the big screen; I saw it first on a bad TV in a dark room. But even then, the sheer FANTASTIC brilliance shone through, and I can safely say I never enjoyed a film so much. But Reloaded and Revolutions only had one saving grace to them (1 Mr Hugo Weaving) and I stopped thinking about the Wachowskis as ""Ground Breakers"" and relegated them (along with Uwe Boll) to ""Kill them. Kill them DEAD.""<br/><br/>Then I saw this film. The themes it deals with are complex and fascinating, the characters well fleshed out and interesting (my favorite being Hugo Weaving, who is quite frankly an acting GOD) and the story intelligent and well designed.<br/><br/>A lot of the shots OOZED atmosphere. Take (for example) Eevie's imprisonment. The cold, bleak atmosphere was bellied by Ms. Portman's acting (and lack of hair, though I look forward to seeing her with flowing locks again), the carefully chosen colour pallet, and (my favorite) Weaving's BEAUTIFUL performance as the two silhouetted men. The shots of the Lesbian prisoner was excellent, and (again, my favorite) the very careful interspersion of Portman dragging herself over to the corner where she read the letter was utter joy.<br/><br/>Then we have the fights. Oh, the fights. How fast they were, how furious, how... energetic. The knife work was fluid and brutal, and V's long, flowing cloak was very, very cool. My favorite moment, however, was at the end, with V going against Creedy's gun-wielding thugs. Yes, Andy, yes, Larry, we DID notice your trademark ""Bullet-Time"" CG, and yes, it did bloody rock.<br/><br/>It was, however, a very Wachowski film. Their trademarks (long, flowing black fabric on the heroes, and of course Bullet-Time) were all there, carefully placed to keep from ruining the atmosphere.<br/><br/>So, my friends, as I leave you... I have one thing left to say. ""Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder, treason and plot. ""I see no reason for the gunpowder treason to ever be forgot."""
"samuelding85","7","3","15","14 March 2006"," V For Victory
","The Wachowski Brothers and their Matrix trilogy assistant director James McTeigue brings out a treat to the audience with V For Vendetta, after their previous disappointment The Matrix Revolutions.<br/><br/>In the British-German production, they have marvelously used British actress Natalie Portman as Evey, a British TV Station crew as the sidekick of V, a victim of a failed experiment who was arrested for being a guerrilla terrorist with the skill of defense and deception, who later becomes the hero of V For Vendetta, leading the people to overthrow the tyranny and autocratic government. Australian actor Hugo Weaving takes the leading role of V, where his true look was never revealed in the film.<br/><br/>It is set in the futuristic world, where England is ruled under autocratic power of the chancellor, Adam Sutler. No one in England had full freedom in their country, where curfews are imposed in the country with no mercy if one is caught on the streets during the curfew hours without a very good reason. Evey is one of the victims, who was saved by V.<br/><br/>V took control of the TV Station Evey works in, and encourages the people to stand up and fight against their tyranny, Nazi-liked government for their freedom. V achieved his objectives through terrorism acts, and took revenge on the group of people who used him in an experiment which kills thousands of non-British in the experiment. As Evey slowly gets to know the story of V, she must also overcome her fear, where her parents died under the rules of the government for sharing the same idea as V.<br/><br/>James McTeigue makes his directorial debut in V For Vendetta, where it amaze the audience with scenes on how V influence the people with his ideas and acts. If you are expecting the scene where thousands of people wear the mask that signify V in the trailer and the teaser poster, McTeigue do it for you, thanks to the experience he had when working in Matrix Revolutions. Together with The Wachowski Brothers and Joel Silver, who is also the producer of Matrix Trilogy, the tense and excitement from Matrix Trilogy has been brought into V For Vendetta.<br/><br/>After seeing him playing the notorious Agent Smith in Matrix Trilogy, Hugo Weaving is casted as V, where we do not get to see his face in the film. We, as the audience of the film, was questioning ourselves: did he do the dubbing for his role, since he has to wear a mask throughout the whole film? It is a bit disappointing that we do not get to see the look of V under the mask.<br/><br/>Being a British herself, Natalie Portman brings out the fear, agony and pain she suffers under the tyranny rule of the government. Not much of a breakthrough, but the scene where her hair was shaved when she was captured is definitely worth a watch.<br/><br/>The film seems to be targeting against the rule of the Nazi power under the lead of the infamous dictator Adolf Hitler. The rule of Nazi power has been brought forward to the modern day England, where the advancement of society seems to have failed stopping the ideas of Nazism in the modern world, where Nazism has been condemned around the world. It is rather unique, or should i say, that terrorism is the remedy to Nazism. I am not influencing or encouraging terrorism attacks to achieve ones objective, but V For Vendetta presents to us how terrorism acts could destroy a rule of terror, but at the same time, questioning ourselves, do we want to live in a world of terror where no security exists among everybody? It is sad that V For Vendetta suffer cuts under the censorship in several countries for the idea of using terrorism to overthrow a tyranny government.<br/><br/>V now marks Victory for the cast and crews to out stand itself above other boring commerical flicks."

"gsygsy","4","2","9","20 January 2017"," On the eve
","I watched this movie on the eve of the inauguration of the 45th President of the USA. It wasn't hard to connect the content of the movie, based on Alan Moore's dystopian series of graphic novels, with fears for the future. I guess that's a sign of the filmmakers' seriousness of intent.<br/><br/>Sure enough, V FOR VENDETTA gets off to a great start, full of action and mystery. As the story progresses, however, the excitement peters out, as it does in the Wachowskis' THE MATRIX trilogy, bogged down in heavy-handed portentousness.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman works hard and effectively in the leading role of Evey Hammond, with Hugo Weaving doing his best to make a credible human being out of the eponymous man in a Guy Fawkes mask. A who's who of character actors, led by the perpetually pained Stephen Rae, toil away earnestly in support.<br/><br/>The film's fatal flaw is that it assumes the majority of people are liberal at heart, and will rise up to oppose right-wing oppression. We just have to take a look at what's happening as I write this. In both the USA and Europe, democracies are turning their backs on liberal values. The demagogues are winning. The moral is, don't rely on the movies for up-to-date political analysis."
"poolandrews","8","2","9","28 August 2010"," Really surprised at how much I liked this, why did it take me so long to watch it?
","V for Vendetta is set in a future Britian where the country is now under the strict dictatorship of High Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), the date is November the 5th as TV production assistant Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) breaks a late night curfew & is attacked by two of Sutler's secret police force the Fingermen but is saved by a man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask who calls himself V (Hugo Weaving). V takes Evey to witness the blowing up of the Old Bailey for which he is responsible, the following day at the British Television Network studios V breaks in & broadcasts a message to Britian claiming he is a modern day freedom fighter who has taken the guise of Guy Fawkes & like Fawkes will try to bring the oppressive Government down. Sutler's security forces try to find V while he sets out on a personal revenge mission...<br/><br/>This American, British & German co-production was the directorial debut of James McTeigue & I must admit that I am amazed that V for Vendetta is in the IMDb user voted Top 250 films (well within the top 200 as well) but at the same time pleasantly surprised because I thought V for Vendetta was a terrific film that has so much going for it. Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore (who has said he didn't like the film) & David Lloyd (who has said he did like the film) I didn't expect such a great film, while the original graphic novel was about V on a quest to create anarchy rather than freedom from an oppressive Government I think the film works extremely well & a lot f it seemed very relevant & topical. Lets be honest, V for Vendetta has a dig at the likes of George Bush & Tony Blair as it presents Britian in the near future as a society run by a dictator & a corrupt Government who have twisted the war on terrorism, the need for security & the fears ordinary people have to take away people civil liberties & freedom just like we are heading towards right now if truth be told. I could also relate to the way Sutler uses & manipulates the media, it's all quite close to home & familiar actually. At over two hours I was never bored by a largely talky film, it held my interest from stat to finish with some great writing, some touching writing, some humorous writing, some exciting writing & some satirical writing. The character's are all strong & there's one great twist about half way through I didn't see coming that was genuine surprise that at first seemed a bit odd but then after thinking about it seemed totally logical.<br/><br/>Based on a comic book there's a great visual style to the film, from the cool fighting & action scenes to some surprisingly touching scenes sensitively shot. I loved the idea of using Guy Fawkes, I am not sure if he is that well known outside of the UK but here the 5th of November is celebrated every year & Fawkes story is know to all. The idea of using the morals & image of Fawkes & the ideas behind the image is a great one that works perfectly (but I guess you would have to know of Fawkes for it to). The special effects are impressive with a cool shot of the House of Parliment being blown up at the end. There is some blood & violence but overall there's more talk although when the action does arrive it's cool. I also loved the dominoes bit, sure it's pointless but it looks great & since it took over 200 hours to set up in reality a lot of time went into creating it.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $54,000,000 this wasn't as big budgeted as some Hollywood films although it does look great & is surely one of the most political films released during the decade, the parallels between the future society seen in V for Vendetta & the the way our own is heading is there for all to see & the similarity between Sutler & certain other well known leaders is also striking. The acting is great from all expect Portman who is a bit flat although tremendous credit goes to Hugo Weaving who manages to put in a great performance & give V real depth despite being hidden behind a mask the entire film.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a marvellous film, both as an action fantasy with lush visuals & as an extreme look at where society is heading, the ambiguity surrounding the character of V helps too as a sort of masked hero who simply just stands for ideas & values. A new personal favourite of mine, I highly recommend it."
"thesar-2","9","2","9","21 May 2010"," Remember, remember to put this in your que
","V for Vendetta really shot itself in the foot. It was advertised as a ""comic-book"" adaptation with action!, adventure!, sword-fights! And yet you will get 95% of the action the previews show in the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the film. The rest isjustplain dialogue.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for a typical, Hollywood/Comicbook/Superhero action movie with a mask vigilante who prefers snappy comebacks and swords over bullets, look further. Rent Batman Begins. You won't be disappointed and you'll be satisfied with your childhood fantasies coming true.<br/><br/>Butif you want an amazing and adult ""comicbook film,"" and a thought-provoking, wonderfully paced movie with extremely rich dialogue, character development and suspenseful intrigue, you can't do wrong with this excellent film.<br/><br/>It's the future! And the grand ole U.S. of A. is no more. Leave it to England to rise above with a new dictatorship hell-bent on keeping people heaven-bound with ""good"" messages and bad symbols underground. This doesn't sit well with 'V' (Weaving) who wants to model his fate with events centuries old. In other words, he wants to blow up the Parliament – on the (Remember, Remember) ""the fifth of November."" Make that, he wants to do it next year. This yearhe has plans.<br/><br/>And the plot thickens. Why is he doing this? Why is he waiting a year? Why doesn't he ever take off that mask? And why does he bother with Evey (Portman)? You knowI'm gonna stop here. I've given possible 1/5 of the plot synopsis away. Watch this wonderful movie and discover the rest of the storyline for yourself. Now, let me compliment the rest of the efforts from those involved.<br/><br/>Let me begin by saying I am NOT a Natalie Portman fan. At all. She was wretched in the Star Wars prequels. She was unbearable in that Wal-Mart Baby movie. (I'm so uninterested in her, I won't even look up the title of that one.) And yet, I did think she fared well in The Professional, but she wasn't what made that movie. Hereshe did a good job. Not excellent, but finallywatchable. She did what she needed to do, she showed emotion when she had to. The shaved head/G.I. Jane/Alien3 look was needed for the plot and yet, she barely stood out in the movie. Who really shined was a personal favorite: Hugo Weaving.<br/><br/>I understand, you can't see him in this movie; his role might as well have been animated, butthat voice. His voice was mesmerizing. I've been a fan of his since The Adventures of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert and the first Matrix. But, unlike a lot of animated features, his voice carries the movie; his dialogue rich and serene. No one could've filled the 'V' mask as he did.<br/><br/>When the action's hot, it's great. When the dialogue is rich, it's splendid. When the intrigue is on, it's interesting. You have an above-human character, one I love in almost any medium: the superhuman-human. And as devoted as he is to his cause, he's still human. They show plenty of examples, but mostly in Portman's Evey.<br/><br/>There's so much to love in this movie – namely the originality, message and dialogue. It's worth a viewing and it's definitely worth a second shot. Of course, a lot of the ""surprises"" or ""twists"" are gone in your second plus screening, it's thoroughly wonderful to fully pay attention to what they're trying to portray or say in their directive.<br/><br/>I'm sure I left out all I wanted to say or convey in regards to this awesome experience, but I must say: Give this a shot. Know that it's not all action, despite the fantastically choreographed action-packed introduction. Know that this very well could (and might) happen. Let's just hope there is a human being that's smart enough, strong enough and determined enough to show us we're not just cattle.<br/><br/>Side Note: Listen to the dialogue. Rewatch the film and really listen to it. ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."" And always ""Remember, remember, the fifth of November."" Side Note 2: (Spoiler Alert) I am thoroughly glad that, despite this being a ""Comicbook"" adapted movie, it was NOT left open for a sequel. Not that, in most cases, that's a bad thing (I loved The Dark Knight, for example) but it's nice, for once, to have a complete movie/story on your hands. And just merely the trailers for this feature indicate a series or franchise. Thank God, they sealed the deal with just this one wonderful movie.<br/><br/>Side Note 3: I recently recommended this film after watching a second time to a friend of mine. Not only am I pleased he liked it, he loved it. It's now in his top 3 of all time. I look forward to his comments on my site. With his enthusiasm, I might have to watch this a third time, sooner than it took me to watch it a second time – several years."

","Let me start by saying that this is a great movie, and I think that everyone needs to watch it. ""V for Vendetta"" has a gripping story line, darkness, and a twisted sort of love story. If you are watching and went ""What?"" you wouldn't be alone, but I believe that you have to watch it again in order for the full plot to sink in to the viewer. The story line is based on Guy Fawkes Night. If you don't know what that is, search it on the internet and you will start to understand the significants of this film. The mysterious ""V"" played by Hugo Weaving, is a vigilantly that you never fully get told the back story of. It is a hard plot to summarize without ruining it, because although it takes some twists and turns it really only has one plot line. In the middle of the film there is a twist that will grip you further into V's world. There are also many questions that are left unanswered and lest for the viewer to ponder. I urge you to spend some time and think about the movie so that you can gather your own ideas about why certain things happen in the film. The best thing about Vfor Vendetta is that the viewer is left to decide the answers for him or herself. This is a great movie and shouldn't be missed."

I only felt it was wasted since it seemed to concentrate on political exiles and gays and lesbians, as if they are the only ones discriminated against.<br/><br/>The story goes back and forth in time and sideways to plots of other people to try and explain the drive.<br/><br/>I am sure this movie was/is loved by many ""alternative lifestyle"" people who feel they need a champion movie.

This movie certainly does not deserve to be in the top 250 of all time, I think once people actually watch it they will see how lame it is.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor rent Sin City, Dark City, The Crow or even 12 Monkeys.

","I cannot believe how many people love this movie. Reading every review along with an average score of 8.1/10 with 23,000 votes prompted me to be very excited for this film.<br/><br/>I brought a friend and had to wake him up several times. I tried really hard to stay awake myself, waiting for the movie to suddenly become as good as people said it was. I was hoping for some sort of plot twist / revelation as was done in the Matrix or something... but nothing much happened except too much un-needed dialogue along with the overuse of adjectives that began with the letter ""V"".<br/><br/>There was absolutely 0 character development in the fact of developing a sense of empathy or emotion for the characters and what happened to them. There were several parts of the movie where I said to myself, ""I think I'm supposed to cry at this part"". I usually do get emotional during a good movie, but not for ""V for Vendetta"". The most emotional part of the film was the sense of relief that overwhelmed me when it was over.<br/><br/>I can see why many people will ""like"" this movie as it does portray an ""extreme"" case of a totalitarian government. A lot of ""Bush"" haters will enjoy the film... but people have to realize that when a government does get to the point seen in the movie, it is from the rise of ""dictators"" like Hitler or Saddam Hussein.<br/><br/>There was one thing that I agreed with in the film is that the mention of a fallen nation (United States) was due to becoming a Godless nation. We are becoming a Godless nation. Unless we go back to the roots (God) that helped found and shape our laws and government, then we are destined to fall."

","After reading of the recent protests in Central London on Guy Fawkes night by Guido mask wearers, it reminded me that I still hadn't seen this film. What a brilliant film this turned out to be. The wonderful prose that flows out from V when he first meets Evey is delightful and there is something almost Shakespearian with the way it is delivered. The story is very intriguing and keeps you hooked throughout. The violence is comical in places and then quite disturbing in others. Brilliantly acted with a stellar cast, this is definitely a film I will have to watch again to take in the richness of the dialogue and the acting. Very entertaining!"

","The Matrix trilogy may have backfired miserably. But at least the Wachowskis gave the opportunity to McTeigue to make a movie that is as uncompromising and provoking as the graphic novel it was based on. It actually makes one wonder how a movie like this ever got out of a major studio. Maybe there is still hope. In the mean time Natalie Portman finally shines as she hasn't in a long long time and Hugo Weaving is unrelenting as the enigmatic V. The biggest selling point is that this isn't a superhero. You never see him performing some impossible feat. Listening to V talking about what destroying buildings means will send a chill down your spine. Powerful ideas make for powerful films."
"calo-calderon","10","1","3","30 July 2015"," V for Vendetta... and for Victory!
","Mad as hell and out to rile up a politically lethargic youth audience, V for Vendetta sometimes trips on its ambitions. But who gives a damn? At least this grabber of a movie actually has ambitions, which makes it unique in a brain-dead multiplex. Better yet, V packs an urgent filmmaking energy that pins you to your seat.<br/><br/>Written by the Wachowskis — Andy and his trans-gender brother, Larry — and directed by first-timer James McTeigue, their assistant on The Matrix, the film flies on a rhythm all its own. There's nothing Neo about V, the masked avenger who uses bombs, daggers and his telegenic charisma to take down a regime that has left him a burned remnant of its ungodly experiments.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving — Agent Smith in the Matrix movies — plays this terrorist grandmaster behind a fiberglass mask that makes his vocal wit and physical eloquence doubly remarkable. Never mind that the Shakespeare-quoting, rose-carrying V comes dangerously close to Phantom of the Opera kitsch. Or that his politics can be as simplistic as Billy Jack's. V has his mojo working.<br/><br/>And so do the filmmakers. The source material is the 1989 graphic novel illustrated by David Lloyd and written by Alan Moore, who wants no part of what the Wachowskis have wrought. Moore took his name off the film's credits. Moore's novel skewered the 1980s England of Margaret Thatcher. In the Wachowski update, England is a police state ruled by Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt), a fear- mongering, gay-bashing, Islam-hating dictator who strips citizens of their civil rights and religious freedoms in exchange for protection from bioweapons of mass destruction. Some see parallels here to BushWorld. Come on. The chancellor, as acted to the hilt by Hurt, can't be W — he's hyper articulate.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta, more fun and less self-referential than those appalling Matrix sequels, is an action film that is not afraid to stop for thoughtful debate, a wry laugh or a lesson on how to fry an egg for a pretty girl. That (the girl, not the egg) would be Evey (Natalie Portman), a slave at a chancellor-controlled TV network. The station has its own Bill O'Reilly figure in the blow hard Prothero (Roger Allam). And the chancellor has his own Dick Cheney in Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith), who aims his buckshot at Deitrich (Stephen Fry), a closet gay who mocks the chancellor in a TV comedy skit. Poor Evey doesn't know where to turn.<br/><br/>On her first meeting with V, who saves her from rape by police thugs, Evey is taken to a rooftop for some fireworks. Not the sexual kind. V raises his hands like a conductor and directs Evey to watch as the Old Bailey blows up and lights the night sky. It's V who set the bombs, in honor of Guy Fawkes, the Catholic vigilante who futilely tried to blow up Parliament on November 5th, 1605. V, in his Fawkes mask, is determined not to fail, vowing that next year, on November 5th, 2020, Parliament will be history.<br/><br/>V sweeps Evey away to his secret lair and shows her his Shadow Gallery, where he keeps forbidden artifacts, such as the Koran, and listens to the Velvet Underground. It's there that she learns of V's brutal history and his reasons for murdering coroner Delia Surridge (a superb Sinead Cusack). V's politicalization of Evey is the film's core. She evades arrest from Finch (a haunted Stephen Rea), the cop on the V case, but not the hands of a hidden tormenter who jails her, shaves her hair (Portman sacrificed her own locks for the role) and pushes her hard to betray V.<br/><br/>Portman's English accent goes in and out, but not her performance, which becomes the heart and soul of the movie. Scratch the lousy Wars films and Portman, from The Professional to Closer, is one of the best actresses of her generation. Here she's dynamite, especially when Evey finds a letter written by a lesbian victim of torture and begins to understand V's true mission.<br/><br/>Though the film runs with the outsiders in society, the Wachowskis don't ignore the dark side of V's character. Cinematographer Adrian Biddle, who died in December, plays with light and shadow in ways that provide depth even when the script settles for glib.<br/><br/>Setting indelible images to a deft score by Dario Marianelli, McTeigue speeds us along to a thunderous climax at Parliament. Calling Warner Bros. irresponsible for releasing a film that rouses an audience to action is like calling the Constitution irresponsible for protecting free speech. The explosive V for Vendetta is powered by ideas that are not computer-generated. It's something rare in Teflon Hollywood: a movie that sticks with you."
"CinematicEddy","8","1","3","16 February 2015"," A movie powered by ideas
","It's always nice to see a movie done right...<br/><br/>'V for Vendetta', directed by James McTeigue is a gorgeous film, done with respect and, sometimes, intelligence... Now, this movie stars Hugo Weaving, who is perfectly cast as V, the protagonist, the terrorist, who is trying to break an oppressive system, one day he meets Evey, played by Natalie Portman, and starts to fall in love with her.<br/><br/>The Wachowski's are the writers, and they actually did a fine job on the movie, but almost lost themselves in some occasions, introducing their style in a story that is more focused on discussion, and this is the only part the movie fell for me, perhaps if it was written by someone else it could've been better, but it doesn't crash the movie down for me, it still holds all the dramatic and epic moments to a certain degree of goodness.<br/><br/>Without a doubt the movie is a winner, even if it diverges from the comic book sometimes."
"anthony-zappia","10","1","3","30 December 2014"," A film (very much) for our times
","This is probably one of the more important films of our time. It's both a warning to us of things to come, but also a subtle indicator of forces already at play in our society: the surveillance state and the use of 'false flag' operations, PR and media manipulation by governments and ruthless political leaders to achieve their ends; in short the total corruption of our democratic processes. It's also a story of retribution (hence the title) and without this personal element, the story would have been like any other dystopian action story. The action scenes are great, but for me it's the story and the ending is just brilliant. I can watch this film again and again. Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman get the thumbs up from me for their roles, but John Hurt is also brilliant in his role as the high chancellor Adam Sutler."
"Rickting","8","1","3","20 December 2014"," Alan Moore should be proud of it even though he isn't
","V For Vendetta looks like a stylishly violent, kinetic, ultra cool dystopian comic book movie. It's not that at all, which is why it's one of the most underrated films in the IMDb top 250. Alan Moore has distanced himself from this, but this adaptation actually worked out. V, played by Hugo Weaving who gives a strong performance despite being underneath a mask for the whole film, has launched a one man revolution against the corrupt British Government. A young woman played by Natalie Portman who is good aside from a grating fake English accent becomes his unlikely ally. VFV certainly isn't what it looks like. V kills his victims through lethal injection and there aren't many fight scenes in the whole film. It's actually quite a talky movie which focuses on its social commentary and thought provoking narrative. VFV has a little too much talking and in terms of political commentary its pretty much an adolescent version and there's not actually that much political stuff which is that relevant, although the film is still thought provoking.<br/><br/>It does lapse into duller territory, but not that often. Most of the time, this is a surprisingly strong and oddly moving science fiction movie which is a lot deeper than you first think. The direction is visually stunning, and the few fight scenes are directed very well. They have more impact as they're used less. The script may be a bit safe in some ways, but it'll seem very deep to many as the political commentary will go over the spectator's head mostly. It's still a good screenplay and the central relationship between V and Evey is unique and touching. It's also got some incredibly pyrotechnics and 2 fantastic uses of the 1812 Overture. VFV deserves more attention than it gets; this is still technically your typical stylish comic book movie, but it has more appeal to those who aren't fans of the genre than you'd expect and a pleasing use of humour as well. Not a masterpiece, but an excellent comic book film overall and in many ways, a very mature and patient one.<br/><br/>8/10"
"datorsiers2","10","1","3","16 December 2014"," ''Ideas are bulletproof''
","An amazing movie, a must watch definitely, of course a little bit unreal, but the idea is just awesome. Many people focus more on trying to figure out who V actually was, but that does not matter.<br/><br/>V had gone through some incredibly difficult times, he wanted to bring back hope to the people and make so people would be in charge of the government(a.k.a the perfect democracy) and not the other way around as it was in the fascistic England. I think it is a great choice not to reveal V's identity, because it leaves you curious, if they would have shown his face, it would just be flat and dull.<br/><br/>Also the movie had a great plot twist, and not your typical end of the movie plot twist, that suddenly changes everything. When Evey was thrown in a cell and treated like crap, she didn't confess and tell anything about V, the way he had set up the environment was awesome, and the letters Evey read in the cell opened up a whole another possible outcome of the movie and made everyone question who V is even more. Then when she finally wasn't afraid and embraced her death sentence, V let her out and completely changed her life with that experience, he wanted to show her what it is like to suffer and be fearless.<br/><br/>The movie had some funny moments too, which kinda eased the tension a little bit and it was just what was needed. A great movie, 10/10."
"brchthethird","9","1","3","6 December 2014"," Still holds up rather well
","It had been a while since I'd seen this movie, so the time was right to revisit it. While it has lost a little of its power in the years since, there's no denying that it is still one of the most entertaining and provocative movies of the 21st century. Recounting the plot is almost pointless now, as most everyone who's into movies knows it at this point. What I can say is that all of the performances are excellent, in particular Hugo Weaving as V. Despite having a mask over his face, or being obscured through darkness, he manages to give a performance with a lot of depth and nuance. He might represent an idea or symbol, but he brings humanity to his character and more than a little bit of wit (and wordplay). I still think that Natalie Portman is the weak link in the cast, but she isn't terrible, by any means. As far as the technical aspects go, most of the special effects still hold up rather well and the film, as a whole, is beautifully shot. There's also some variation on the bullet-time effect that the Wachowskis popularized with their Matrix trilogy (and who wrote this screenplay). James McTeigue, the director and long-time Wachowski collaborator, did his finest directing work with this film in my opinion. Overall, with an engaging, well-acted story that has still has relevant political themes, you can't get much better than this. And may this film never be forgot."

","I just watched this movie the other night, and it was amazing. The beginning starts off with the words, Remember, Remember The 5th of November. This is the time period around the mid 1600's that Guy Fawkes plan to blow up Parliament failed. He was captured along with his cohorts. He was taken to the gallows and hung for his crime. Once we see Fawkes hung we are take some four hundred years into a Fascist England. I would say the year in the film is around 2020. We meet Evey a young lady watching a Totalitarian T.V. show, the host Deitrich. He is explaining why England is in the state it's in due to all the war's the, homosexuality, the disease, ETC.. Evey is in her Uncle's apartment, she turns and looks at the clock and notices she is past curfew. While walking home she gets caught by the secret police. They rough her up and try to rape her. V who is an anti- hero in the movie comes to her rescue. He is wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, he saves Evey by killing the men with the knives he carries. He ask if she is hurt, and from then on it seems the two form somewhat of a bond. It is like Evey is his protégé. She is loyal; but she keeps her guard up around him, like his he a friend or foe. She is or to me like his prisoner at first; but more of an ally as the movie proceeds, especially near the end of the movie. Since this is in the future 2020/2030, we realize in the beginning the United States does not exist anymore. There are wars, plagues,; and fascist rule is the norm in Britain. Evey and V get to know each other better and she finds out by accident he was horribly burned. V explains his past to her, about Larkhill prison. A place where criminals and undesirables where housed. They suffered inhumane treatment, pawns in awful experiments, then dumped in mass graves. He was lucky to escape due to a fire and vowed to get his revenge on those who worked there. One night Evey is watching the news and hears about the murder of Deitrich. Then asks V if he was responsible, he says yes. The vengeance begins, and V strikes back leaving a rose at each murder scene. Even after this happens Evey proves her loyalty to him. She gets kidnapped and held as a prisoner. Little does she know that V is responsible for the kidnapping. While being held prisoner she finds a note written by a young woman who was a prisoner at Larkhill. Evey reads it explains about her lesbian relationships and how family and society treated her. A relationship that grew despite the backlash from parents and society. The secret police found out and got her partner first, then came for her. Evey's loyalty continued for V, even while being locked up. When she was able to escape she finds out V in living in the basement/lockup of Larkhill. She is upset at first thinking the whole thing was a hoax. The note was true the girl was the prisoner next to him. She learns a lot from his past by this time, and is more than an ally. In the end, they track down V, even though V dies his plan to blow up Parliament gets carried out by Evey. This is a great anti-hero movie. The cast was great and because of the plot I am glad there wasn't any backlash towards the movie. I am surprise no one in England complained about it, the Government. Even though I didn't care for The Matrix, I loved this gem of a movie. This film has it all, comedy, tragedy, suspense, and action. This is a great movie that balances out the yin and yang, you will not be disappointed. THX, Kris L. CocKayne"

","It is a brilliantly constructed piece of art. V for Vendetta strays from the usual comic book superhero routine of Hollywood and presents a character that is filled with ambiguity leaving the audience the choice to agree or disagree with the motives, actions, intentions and beliefs of V. The political ideology presented in the movie can be defined as controversial at best. The Wachowski Brothers allow the audience to decide whether the political ideologies are ""right"". Its the kind of movie that has enough action to keep you at the edge of your seat, an engaging storyline and riveting political satire to make you scratch your head for a few days.

","""Remember Remember the 5th of November."" The opening line of narrative dialogue paired with the expositional sequence of Guy Fawkes' attempt to destroy Parliament gives the audience a chance to gather their wits and prepare for an epic tale, a ride on the edge of the seat. The graphic novel, by Alan Moore was adapted for the screen by ingenious film artists Lana and Larry Wachowski, the creators of The Matrix, V for Vendetta lives up to the reputation it has earned in nearly every way. From the intriguingly deft and intricate story to the personal characters who undergo dynamic development, the key elements of film are manifested in V for Vendetta.<br/><br/>Three characters, each with their own unique back stories and plot lines, carry the story and twist every bit of the audiences expectations throughout the film. The namesake of the film, a vigilante clad in black and donned with an iconic mask bearing a smile (Hugo Weaving), is the films primary protagonist and plot stimulant. The masked phantom, alleged 'V,' is introduced as and continues to play the part of a cold, calculating and manipulative terrorist who acts destructively against the futuristic fascist society towards an idealistic end. Despite his masked face, Weaving presents composure and intent devotion to V's objective through commanding body language and powerful diction until a young girl makes V question everything about himself. This youthful girl, Evey, performed masterfully by Natalie Portman, lives with obvious disregard for the government and its morals. As her back story is unveiled, however, she reveals her fear of repercussions and acts in betrayal. Following one of the greatest dynamic character developments ever, Evey is granted a choice to complete the plan V placed into motion. The anchor of the film, a British investigator named Finch (Stephen Rea), appears to be fully loyal to the dystopian government, but as the film progresses and he uproots secrets of the British Chancellors' actions, he begins to make his own decisions. <br/><br/>As phenomenal as the character development is, so is the relationships between characters in the film. Evey and V, outwardly appearing completely different, have parallel qualities of strong-willed confidence. From the reflected shots of V and Evey preparing themselves at their mirrors to the end of the film where they share life-changing experiences, the film makes exceptional use of parallelism to convey the similarities of the two protagonists. Ultimately, however, it is their one dominating difference that proves to be the most important; V, possessor of the violence and calculation required for the destruction of the old world contrasts Evey's gentle and compassionate characteristics which are the requirement for the creation of the new world. The excellent casting of these two hugely dynamic actors creates an equally dynamic contrast between the unique characters. <br/><br/>Visually, V for Vendetta is saturated with dynamic and artistic shots that create a unique vision of post-apocalyptic Britain. Much of the film's shots, including all exterior pans of the city use a blue filter to portray a sense of cold emptiness. During several flashbacks, scenes with historical art and music, and the titanic climax, the shots change drastically to filters with warm hues. Cinematographer Adrian Biddle uses variation of large, wide angle-lens shots for the big-picture views of the city and population and close up focus lenses for the intimate sequences between the characters. Dario Marianelli composes a truly excellent score for the film that is full of dynamic crescendos that rise and fall with the actors experiences. <br/><br/>The continuity of V for Vendetta is its strongest point. Director James McTeigue ingeniously weaves together the intimate and intricate character development of V, Evey, and Finch with the weight of the entire population's reactions. The primary weapon that the fascist rulers use to control the population is the machine of the media. When V ultimately turns their fault-proof universal broadcast system against them in order to speak to the people directly, we are able to follow the entire population's reactions throughout the film as the television broadcasts play in their homes. The population of Britain ultimately becomes its own dynamic character. The filmmakers reveal the magnitude of V's plan as he instigates the people to act. <br/><br/>V for Vendetta is definitely one of the most complex films I have ever seen; at times the film was even confusing. There are many minor characters, such as government officials, that are referred to throughout the film, and often hard to keep track of. The film required several viewings with complete and undeterred focus in order to keep track of every minute plot detail. It is definitely not a film to watch with friends you wish to have discussions with. My biggest problem with the film was its lack of closure in its ending. As colossal and impressive as it was, it leaves the audience with a lot of unanswered questions and a slightly anti-climactic story closure. <br/><br/>The film is definitely worth watching. It addresses questions and arguments that leaves most viewers with a lot to discuss. The film is a cinematic excellence, a work of art with its blend of sound, story, and shots. V for Vendetta remains visually vivid and vibrant, poses individuals of valiant valor and vicious villains, and presents to its viewers a venturous voyage of value."

","Although Alan Moore,who wrote the novel,hated the representation of his character as he felt it didn't portray the true meaning of his vigilante hero, it has heart and a meaning which stays with you. It was written during Thatchers' Britain, where the establishment was seen as taking away some of the rights and freedoms of the common people and turning cities into post industrial wasteland of tower blocks and social decay. V for Vendetta as a movie is a stylised portrayal of a working class hero. It is an important film in today's society as it warns us of the fact that chipping away at rights ultimately means democratic processes cease to exist. Hugo Weaving as V is outstanding, (second choice after James Purefoy who couldn't act and wear the mask), his performance of the opening speech sets the tone of the whole movie. Natalie Portman is Natalie Portman as always, and although doesn't bring anything extra to her the role, her performance is adequate enough not to detract from the film. Stephen Rae, the master of underplay, is brilliant as Detective Finch who adds mood and atmosphere to every scene he is in. I have seen most graphic novel films, and none of them seem to have anything to tell us about the world we live in, apart from the latest CGI techniques. V for Vendetta is different it is story with a start,middle,end and a moral, if you have not seen it,which I doubt, then please do, sure you will thoroughly enjoy it."

","V for Vendetta is one of those films that transcends its source-material and becomes a truly influential piece of work. Set in a Fascist Great Britain following the victory of Germany in World War II, it shows the mysterious V (Hugo Weaving) taking revenge on all those government servants and employees who consciously used human beings for experiments, while deliberately creating an epidemic so as to encourage the people to support them. Among the assorted bad guys he exterminates are Roger Allam as a military leader and media personality (bearing a strong resemblance to the UK Independence Party's Nigel Farage), Sinead Cusack as a crooked scientist and John Hurt as a truly awe-inspiring Big Brother figure. V is aided in his quest by Evie Rutherford (Natalie Portman), who discovers a lot about herself and her commitment in the process. With astounding special effects, including a rousing climax when the Houses of Parliament is set on fire - in a deliberate reenactment of the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 - V FOR VENDETTA offers a chilling vision of what can happen to so-called 'democracies,' when individuals acquire too much power. If nothing else, we should aim to retain the capacity to disagree with people, even at the cost of our own lives."

","With the Oscar season here and the summer movie season fast approaching, I wanted to talk about a film I think fits into both. Now comic book films are usually shrugged off as just popcorn fluff. Most times, they are. To this day, however, there hasn't been a comic book film that has challenged me intellectually more than V For Vendetta. It is one of the most intelligently made, beautifully shot, well performed films of the genre. But sadly for some reason, it is FORGOTTEN.<br/><br/>V For Vendetta plot revolves around a knife wielding masked terrorist/freedom fighter trying to take down an oppressive British government in the not too distant future. I put terrorist/freedom fighter because the film blurs the line between the two. It makes you question the difference and presents the perspective of people on either side of the chaos. Some would argue that the character of V is clearly the hero and the government is bad. However, when you really get into the specifics of V's acts, it is hard to paint him as a true blue hero. Even an antihero for that matter. Robin Hood robbed from the rich and gave to the poor. V is out for vengeance, admittedly so. He kills in cold blood. He kills innocents. He kidnaps. He tortures. He does whatever it takes to accomplish his goals. You might say the ends justify his means, but his acts seen through a different spectrum can easily be construed as terror. That is why I love this film. It can be dissected and analyzed even to this day. The Avengers is my favorite comic book movie of all time, however, V For Vendetta is much meatier when it comes to substance.<br/><br/>Comic book legend Alan Moore is famous for angrily dismissing and disavowing any adaptations of his work. This is thanks primarily to the abysmal League Of Extraordinary Gentleman. I wish he'd take a slightly lighter stance on this though. It might be easy for me to say but, films aren't bad solely because the filmmakers take liberties with the source material. I detest Michael Bay's Transformer films and Marc Webb's Amazing Spider-Man not just because they changed things. I detest them because they are poorly written, horribly performed, lowest common denominator catering tripe. Their changes weren't done to add anything new or stimulating to the material. They were made for convenience sake. The same cannot be said for V For Vendetta. Yes, V is a warmer character in the film than he was in the comic book. However, I think that makes him even more complicated when compared to the coldness of his methods. Yes, the fascist vs. anarchist theme was more liberal vs. neo- conservatism. However, that is a lot timelier for today's political atmosphere and still has the nod to the fascist's ideas of purity from the comic book. My point being that the alterations made in V For Vendetta do not weaken it as a story. It merely updates it. <br/><br/>The Wachowskis, the source material meddlers in this case, exist in a weird place for me as a film fan. I was highly disappointed with their conclusion of The Matrix trilogy, but still respect the fact they always take crazy chances. They entrusted the directing duties to long time collaborator James McTeigue, while staying on to write and produce. However, their fingerprints are still all over this picture. Finding and concentrating on the heart of their cinematic worlds is a common Wachowski m.o.. Where a film like V For Vendetta could have just fallen into the basic action vehicle cliché, the Wachowskis don't let it. There are genuinely moving moments in the film that still stun me. The action scenes are terrific, but always serve as a tool to tell the story. Not the other way around.<br/><br/>Before The Dark Knight came along, V For Vendetta was my choice for best ensemble cast performance in a comic book film. Strange category, I know. However, it is always a relief and a thrill for me when I see great talent trying to do great work in a genre film such as a comic book movie. It thrilled me in History Of Violence, it thrilled me in The Dark Knight, and it thrilled me in V For Vendetta. It is still a common misconception that the genre should be treated the way Schumacher treated Batman. But there can be some amazing work turned in with the cape and cowl subset. For example, this is by far my favorite performance by Hugo Weaving. Yes, even more than his iconic Agent Smith. Odd, seeing as we never see his face and that he was a last second replacement for James Purefoy. Despite his Oscar, I'd put Weaving's V right up there with Ledger's Joker. To accomplish the subtleties of V's rage, anguish, humor and theatricality through an emotionless mask with only a voice is no small feat. Portman, who I've loved since Leon: The Professional, seems to be playing a stereotypical damsel at first. Much like she did in Thor. However, Evey has the strongest arc in the film. Her performance highpoint happens during the film's big twist. Her emotional journey during the four minute long scene hints at the Oscar caliber performance she had in her in the years to come. Other than the leads, you have stellar supporting performances from John Hurt, Stephen Fry, Roger Allam, and the unsung anchor of the film, Stephen Rea. There is absolutely no phoning it in here.<br/><br/>V For Vendetta doesn't get nearly as much love as it should. Even from it's creator. It seems to get misplaced amongst it's lesser comic book movie brethren For me, however, it is a film that shall never be FORGOT. Remember, remember...to watch it....then tell me I'm wrong."

","""V for Vendetta"" is one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. The film itself is a superb adaption of the graphic novel. One of the best aspects of this film is the depth of the plot and its characters. Hugo Weaving is simply the perfect guy to possibly play V. Natalie Portman does a fine job and the rest of the cast did a fine job.<br/><br/>This film is about a terrorist by the name of 'V' who aims to bring justice and piece to this totalitarian society. As he encounters and falls in love with Eevy, he begins to realize the truth. <br/><br/>Though classified under an action film, this is definitely not an action film. Its more of a Sci-Fi, Drama than action due to the fact that it only has a couple of short action sequences.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is one of the greatest films of all time."

","So who is this masked man who calls himself V? He is a freedom fighter. He is a terrorist. He is a hero. He is a villain. Depends on your point of view. The movie brings a young woman, Evey, into V's world. And it is Evey's point of view which will prove to be most vital. What will she make of this man who is her rescuer and then her captor? What will V inspire in Evey? What will she discover in herself? Does she have the strength to do what is right? And what is right anyway? It's a movie which asks a lot of questions, not the least of which is whether Parliament is going to get blown to bits.<br/><br/>The story takes place in a near-future dystopian London. The world has gone to hell in a handbasket. The United States has collapsed, chaos and terror seem to be the order of the day worldwide. England is presented as the last bastion of modern civilization. But all is not wine and roses here. Control is maintained by a government which rules with an iron fist. The fascist totalitarian regime has stolen freedom from its people. And in some cases stolen away their very lives. Undesirables are shuttled off to camps. Dissidents, minorities, homosexuals, Muslims, anyone who does not fit the ruling party's standard of purity is taken away, presumably to die in the camps. Those who remain ""free"" live in fear of the government. There really is no freedom at all. One man stands against this. V is determined to bring down the fascists, to give England back to its people. And to blow up some buildings along the way.<br/><br/>The movie begins with V rescuing Evey from an attack by the corrupt, rather Neanderthal, secret police. V blows some stuff up and they go their separate ways but they are soon to meet again. V commandeers a TV station to invite the people of England to rise up and join him. Conveniently for the movie's plot Evey works at this station and she helps him escape although she gets herself knocked out cold in the process. V brings her back to his hideaway and tells her she must remain there with him for one year for her own safety and to protect his identity as he builds toward the big climactic moment of his revolution. Understandably not thrilled with this scenario Evey plots to escape. But while Evey and V are together what connections will form? What does she really think of the man behind the mask? <br/><br/>Events transpire which will force Evey to evaluate not just V but herself. She must find an inner strength. She changes, grows, learns so much about herself and perhaps comes to understand V's point of view. He may be an anarchist or a terrorist and the High Chancellor surely wants his head on a plate. But maybe V has had it right all along. OK, his methods are admittedly unorthodox but where does the true evil in this story lie? On the surface this may seem to be V's story, V's movie. But the argument can be made that it's really Evey's story which is most important of all. It's her evolution which drives the movie forward. And Natalie Portman does a wonderful job portraying that evolution. As Evey finds a power she didn't know she had Portman grows right along with the character. Hugo Weaving, in playing V, had the challenging task of giving life to a man hidden away behind a mask. Weaving does this beautifully, giving personality to a man whose face we never even see. Supporting players Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry and John Hurt all turn in fine work in their respective roles of detective, talk show host and tyrant. It's a movie about two revolutions. There's V's grand plot to topple tyranny. And there's the revolution inside Evey as a passive young woman begins to strive for control of her own destiny. It's a very compelling story presented in rather stunning visual style by director James McTeigue. Remember, remember, the Fifth of November. This is a movie which most certainly should never be forgot."

","This is one of the greatest movies of this century for a number of reasons, for starting the plot was superb, how pain can lead to vengeance without losing the mind and intelligence and how fear can lead societies to change their freedoms for security witch are topics in every day life day in some countries, are perfectly depicted and the director know what he is talking about and how to talk about it. The acting too was something marvelous, Weaving who never shows his face still managed to transmit real feeling trough his voice and movements. The performance given by Portman I think should have earned her an Oscar nomination and the rest of the cast were good as well. This movie I will see a hundred times more and never get tired of it."

He has a mask which is similar to Guy Fawkes. V tries to pursue Fawkes' ideas. His goal is taking people's attention to bad things which are disguised very well.<br/><br/>By the way, we never see V' real face.<br/><br/>Splendid movie. Everything is well organized in this film. I recommend everyone to watch."

","V for Vendetta explores many themes that struck a chord with me, particularly in today's political climate. The idea of fear being used as a smokescreen in order to deprive people of their civil liberties rang true- as did the Islamophobia, Homophobia and general disdain for any kind of human diversity.<br/><br/>It takes a while for the film to grow on you, but soon you will find yourself caring in the tale of Evie, a woman who is very much awakening to the ugliness around her, and is empowered enough to take action. There are some especially moving scenes- including Evie's torture and her discovery of the dead woman's letter. You will find yourself thinking of the strength of human spirit, and you will find yourself somewhat inspired.<br/><br/>The marketing has strongly associated the film with screenwriter the Warschowski Brothers. This could be potentially damaging because it really isn't an action film- and the fight sequences that are int his film don;t necessarily have the same visual flair as found in the Matrix movies. Instead we have a film that is far more broody and thoughtful, it's about characters growing, and pasts and agendas being revealed. In contrast the matrix's philosophical musings, particularly towards the end of the trilogy, often felt like window dressing, and sadly nonsensical and self important.<br/><br/>So watch this film with an open mind, and expect something different. You will be rewarded for it."

","V for Vendetta is one of my favourite movies of all time. Despite its length, it remains engaging throughout. The dialogue is particularly brilliant, as are the visuals. Despite being a ""comic book movie"" you would never be able to guess that it is one except for a couple telling scenes. The movie has a perfect balance of excitement, dialogue and empowering scenes. The overall message is one that is always relevant and even more so as of late thanks to the Occupy Wall street protests against controlling government.

","In the last decade, we have gotten a lot of comic book movies. Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, Spiderman, X-men, Superman Returns, and the Marvel's Avenger's series. Yet of the comic book movies that I've seen, V for Vendetta is my personal favorite. Yes, I like this movie more than The Dark Knight, more than Iron Man, even more than the Avengers. And I had never even heard of the graphic novels before, but now I kind of want to read them, and I don't even read comics.<br/><br/>I love futures where a totalitarian government has taken over. It's a great warning that if we give too much power to our governments, then we will lose all freedom. Even though the film is set in Britian, it applies to pretty much any country with a non-communist government. It's like V said, ""People should not fear their government, government should fear their people."" The character of V is very interesting. You never see his face, so there is a bit of mystery to him, and as the story goes on we learn more about his back story. I don't know if you would call him a hero, or anti hero. He's basically a terrorist, but he's doing it for the right reasons.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is great, I've always liked her since Phantom Menace, and she is so hot, even when she is bald. The villain is great, the dialog works really well, and it's just a plain awesome movie. I mean they blow up important buildings while the 1812 Overture is playing. And it's really funny at parts.<br/><br/>There are a few problems I have though. There is one part that doesn't make any sense to me, and I will have to spoil part of the movie to explain it. Who did V get to interrogate Evey. I mean he can't be that good at throwing his voice. We see hands when Evey is getting her hair cut and they weren't burnt. Plus why did he do it, he is just that heartless. And I didn't care for the flashback about Valerie, I know it gave Evey hope to get through her ordeal, but for me it just slowed things down and besides, we already knew the government imprisoned homosexuals, so why did we need to be reminded.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is my favorite Comic book movie, I love the plot, characters, and just find it to be a fun movie. Some things don't make sense, but it doesn't stop it from being a really good film. If you love Comic book films, check it out"

I give this movie a 10 out of 10 and highly recommend it to anyone who thinks outside the box. Natalie Portman is excellent as well as John Hurt, and Hugo weaving is the only one who could have played this role in my opinion he is amazing in this. Even though there are to many movies to make up lists and ratings for and they all have strengths and weaknesses I consider this movie to be nearly perfect in its execution."

","This has to be one of my all time favourite movies. V for Vendetta is a fantastically crafted story of dystopia under a tyrannous dictator, and both the quality of the acting and directing truly stand out. It is an intensely moving film and manages to be brilliantly exciting at the same time.<br/><br/>The film very sensibly ditched the anarchic message of the original graphic novel, for a more poignant and relevant message about the importance of freedom and the strength of the individual. Perhaps a large part of the film's poignancy lies in the range of controversial topics it addresses such as homosexuality, religion, totalitarianism and terrorism.<br/><br/>I was shocked with the many critical reviews this movie was given at the time of its release. For me it was (and is) a masterpiece and I can't recall ever choosing to rewatch a movie as many times as I have V for Vendetta. A really remarkable film."

The movie starts off with a bang, though at first it seems like it's like all those typical superheroes movies (like an unknown identity saving a lady from oppressors), but later it's found that it's more than a ""just-an-action-movie"", having all the characteristics of being good political satire. <br/><br/>Set upon futuristic great Britain, where bureaucracy is at it's peak, V(Hugo Weaving) is a masked freedom fighter wants to implement justice and fairness and also to make the people realise that. In his mission, he finds an ally in the form of a girl he once rescued , Evey (Natalie Portman). Then, the movie revolves around a few twists and turns, and also V, with his extremely high quality combative skills, leaving the cops chasing shadows.<br/><br/>Now in the performances, Hugo Weaving haven't showed his face in a single scene, but even without any facial expression, the charisma around the character and the awesome dialogue-delivery he manages a splendid job. So does Natalie Portman, her acting is as good as her beauty. <br/><br/>Finally, when u see the name of Wachowski brothers in the credits u expect some great visual effect, especially in action sequences, and they haven't disappointed (special mention for the climax fight scene). :)"

","Alan Moore and David Lloyd wrote this as a graphic novel from 1982 to 1989. The decade of the 2000's was the decade were the Graphic Novel emerged onto the big screen with films like ""300"", ""Watchmen"", and ""X-men III: The Last Stand"" which was based on The Phoenix Saga graphic novel by Marvel. Of all the graphic novels made to film, ""V for Vendetta"" flawlessly captures the cinematography created in the graphic novel art, even more so than ""Watchmen"". The Wachowski Brothers and director James McTeigue recreated the graphic novel as a film depicting a grim, bleak future where England has been manipulated into a reactionary government. The underlying message of course is ""Beware"" - It could happen in the ""Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-Erica"" as the character in the film played by Roger Allam - ""Prothero"", calls the USA (""Prothero"" is probably a play on the name ""Prospero"" - as this film has a lot of references to Shakespeare in it).<br/><br/>Natalie Portman and veteran Hugo Weaving spearhead a great cast which includes John Hurt (""Sutter""), Stephen Rea (""Finch""), and Stephen Fry (""Dietrich"" - Fry most recently plays Mycroft Holmes in the 2nd Robert Downey Jr. 'Sherlock Holmes"" film and also the Cheshire cat voice in 'Alice in Wonderland"")- The rest of the cast include Jeremy Iron Spouse Sinéad Cusack, Natasha Wightman, Rupert Graves, Tim Piggot-Smith.<br/><br/>As we never see Weavings face in this entire film, we depend on his rich voice to develop the character of ""V"". Portman begins her ""Evey"" (E-V) role as a cipher, but the character was given more substance and personality in this treatment- Alan Moore vied to have his name removed from this film, just like he did for Watchmen.<br/><br/>There is one moment in the film where Rea has a revelation of connection, the filmmaker uses this as an opportunity to collect all the discordant plot elements and merges them all together for the viewer. This is probably the finest moment in the film, the music very powerful.<br/><br/>""V""'s Jukebox contains songs by Julie London, and Cat Power- Kind of an odd combination but it works in this film."

This was said for example by Nicolas Maquiavello in his book ""the Prince"", 5 century's ago, this is not a new idea, and is perfectly depicted in the film. ""V"" is quite a fascinating character, is a brilliant person, a man full of culture, a real intellectual, he indeed is blinded by a belief, but can that be permitted? Can a person be justified of his/her actions as a trigger for a bigger mean or belief? The movie incites us to try and respond this question. When is a revolution possible? When can it be justified? Can terrorists actions be justified if done for a bigger end? All these questions must be responded by each and everyone of us, can we make things that are not for bragging if made for a bigger most altruistic and fair cause? Can we hurt someone (as V did with Evey, to try and arise new beliefs and purposes? Leaving behind those kinds of questions, as an action film is perfect, pure adrenaline, Hugo Weavings voice is captivating, and Natalie Portman (as usual with the exception of Quuen Amidala) delivers a tremendous performance. A brilliant movie that deals with not very easy to handle issues, more and more after 9/11. Just two more things I loved the use of songs like ""Garota de Ipanema"", ""Corcovado"" and ""Street Fighting Man"" and finally for me the character of Prothero could've been called Bill O'Riley same persona, same speech, same intransigent ideas, same stupidity, same person Prothero and O'Riley."

","Not only did I find the production and photography of this film outstanding, but also its cold critic to totalitarian regimes and their threat. Being a Venezuelan in these confusing times, the movie presents an ad hoc critic to what may potentially be our near future in this country. I did find, however, that the blame of all evil on the U.S. a little tiresome, as a political statement. Nevertheless, it provided a scary wake up call for all of us who sit and wait for things to change by themselves. The exaltation of individuality and true freedom is probably one of the most important and underlying messages of this movie. Dialogues, even though a little ""matrix-like"", add to the tension that is felt throughout the film."

","When I walked into the cinema to watch V for Vendetta I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. The trailer was rather vague, and the posters kept pushing forth the words ""from the directors of the Matrix"". Anyway, I took the chance, spent the 8.50 to check it out, and that was the best 8.50 i've spent on a movie in a long long while.<br/><br/>From the word 'go' the movie grips you with its tone and lighting. Dark corridors and stylish camera work. Enter 'V' (Hugo Weaving), with his crisp language and eloquent introduction full of V's in it, and you are gripped by his charisma and manner. Hugo Weavings pulls off a marvelous feat with bringing V to life, especially since V is totally masked with an expressionless face throughout. We relate to him, we sympathize with him, and we wonder about him. A wonderful job. He deserves an Oscar for the effort.<br/><br/>Along with Natalie Portman (whose English accent is sometimes a bit funny, but worked nevertheless), V attempts revolution against a government not unlike what is portrayed in George Orwell's famous novel '1984'. We follow through his plan, the ups and downs, and his hope for a future. A classical example of a true revolutionary seeking transparency and justice.<br/><br/>Aside from the fact that V for Vendetta is a great movie having the usual features of good movies in abundance, viz: excellent acting, great story, stylish presentation, perfect ending, I think the point it brings across is far more valuable to our very complacent modern society than the movie itself. I highly recommend it 10/10."

Stephen Fry, who I still like to call Jeeves after the British comedy ""Jeeves and Wooster"" I used to watch as a kid, does a great job playing Gordon, a middle-aged TV comedian. Stephen Rea convinces as a police inspector trying to find the truth in the totalitarian society. Many other actors would deserve mentioning, too, but 1000 characters would not suffice.<br/><br/>The only thing that bugged me after the movie was the Rover. I mean, Rover bankrupted last year, and this movie takes place like 20 years or so in the future, so how on Earth is London police driving Rovers?<br/><br/>In general, a great film, and even if it's not a type of a movie you would normally see, watch it for the talent of the actors. They are worth it."

","'V For Vendetta' is truly an amazing film. I must say that I have never seen a better movie this year. Everything about this movie was incredible.

Also, a special mention to Dario Marianelli for his incredible music score. A damn good movie. Couldn't have been better.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to just about anyone.

No one should ever forget this movie after watching it of coarse you should expect such greatness from Hugo Weaving, Natalie Portman and The Wachowski Brothers. This film really has got all a good and great movie should have, such as an enticing story, intense and interesting characters such as V, awesome special effects, Extrodirary Directing and breathtaking action sequences.

","This film I never interested until a Buddhist monk told me to see it. When I saw it I thought very compelling. I've seen it many times and it is interesting all the time. It has many life messages like the fear of death and people who aren't. And all our fears like fear of diseases, terrorists, people and other things is all converged on the fear of death. In Buddhism death is natural and obvious but because of our attachments to the body, to sensual pleasures, doing cruel and vile things and not knowing the truth( Dhamma) when death appears we are fearful. As what V said to her when she left the prison we are always running away from painful experiences and possessing nice experiences. Like V said he was always living with hate that it ate him so much that he would die from it and something changed in him and he saw the truth."
"OriginalSheady","10","1","3","27 September 2006"," Amazing Film! Don't see many films of this calibre in recent times
","Brilliant! In the past few years, films have had appalling scripts on the most part, and concentrated on Special Effects. I heard that this was a political thriller, and I thought that this sounded different, I'm currently developing a political outlook, and also happen to like Natalie Portman. Being British, I also take a keen interest in films based here, to see the media's perception of British life.<br/><br/>This was quite a complex film, and had so many story lines and back-stories going. The characters were really well explored (except the mysterious V of course), and it takes an interesting look at the future. It also shows what a dictatorship could be like in a wealthy nation like the U.K, and shows both sides- the dictator and the terrorist, who would both be perceived as bad people. However, as I heard in another film ""One man's terrorist, is another man's freedom fighter""- this truly applies to V, who wants to overthrow the dictatorship of the Chancellor and free the people. He has greatly lines, and comes from an exceptional screenplay, written for the well-educated, including a wide vocabulary of words as well as quotations from Shakespeare. A favourite line of mine was ""People shouldn't fear their government, the government should fear it's people""-which I found really thought-provoking. But it's not how some may picture the film so far from what I've said. If you have an image of too old men having a debate across a table for 2 hours..you're dead wrong! There's a nice balance of character development, great script, as well as top action. Meticulously choreographed fights with V, breath-taking effects (particularly with the explosions- I say no more on that front) and moments that really sent a shiver down my spine. A classic film, that should remain popular for generations!"

","Ugh, I wish I had seen this in the theaters! What a great movie -- intellectual, exciting, and has a political point. Fascism is closer than we think, and it's our freedom to speak out that makes democracy so crucial, and our integrity that is at the very core of us. Hugo Weaving is amazing, as usual, even though you can't see his face. I was very impressed with Natalie Portman as well -- she redeemed herself for the star wars prequels! I'm curious to read the graphic novel -- several things I have read said the author did not like the story re-casted in the light of current politics, but I think such a story should be told to adapt to the times at hand, as a wakeup call to what is really important to all of us, and how powerful a weapon fear really can be."
"rinky22","8","1","3","23 September 2006"," Great Production
","Years ago, my wife and I waited every month for the new V for Vendetta comic book to come out. The first seven issues were printed in England and then, Alan Moore (one of the greatest comics writers) took a break for a couple of years on other projects. DC Comics got him to finish it. I was little disappointed with the ending. However, this film is a great production of that comic series. The ending works well. V is a mysterious figure subverting the totalitarian state brought about by a devious Big Brother-type politician (ironically, John Hurt from 1984). This is a great production. The visuals, the music and the story all well done and working together. We both loved it. Better than The Matrix."
"soundvision","10","1","3","22 September 2006"," Daring, timely and gripping. Up there with the best.
","For reasons known or unknown, the publicity machinery for V for Vendetta had been relatively muted compared to its less deserving cohorts this year  so much so that I only finally managed to watch it on board an airliner's in-flight entertainment program, months after its screening in the cinemas. I really did not know what to expect then, but I can safely say now that it was probably the best 2 hours I had ever spent in cargo class.<br/><br/>Not being familiar with the original graphic novel, I can only judge the movie on its own merits. It is certainly one of the most intelligent and beautifully nuanced commercial movie releases for a long time. The Wachowski brothers had finally redeemed themselves for their underwhelming Matrix sequels.<br/><br/>There were invariably several issues that were left hanging at the end. Indeed, should every maligned individual with a cause célèbre or an axe to grind, be entitled to go after the detractors? Where does one draw the line? Perhaps the fundamental answer lies within us, or Valerie says, ""Our integrity sells for so little but it is all we really have. It is the very last inch of us but within that inch we are free."" One of the best movies of all time."

","""Remember, remember, the fifth of November, gunpowder treason and plot. I see no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot."" I've never read the graphic novel, but I don't think you need to read it to appreciate the movie. I saw the film last night at it's World Premiere at the Berlin International Film festival. Though it became a little weighty in the middle (one part seemed to drag a little) other than that it was a great experience. The story was so topical that I got seriously emotional during a lot of parts. Weaving did an excellent job with the mysterious title character ""V"", creating a poetic, intelligent, and compassionate yet ruthless character. Portman always seems to surprise me, except with her Star Wars character. She portrays tremendous emotional range and transforms completely throughout the movie. This is one of those movies that really sticks in your head long after you watch it though... and it continues to stir and grow."

","Before watching V for Vendetta, I had great hopes for this movie. All my friends, that had watched the movie before me, said that it was spectacular. Besides I saw the average grade for the movie in IMDb. moreover, I have not read the comic, but i heard about the very interesting scenario.<br/><br/>When I finished watching the film, I felt unsatisfied.<br/><br/>Personally, I didn't like the Matrix trilogy, because of the directing style, which exists in V for Vendetta too (due to the Wackofsky brothers, I suppose. I believe there are far superior movies of similar genre that have better fighting scenes and camera shots, like Spiderman 2 or Hero, or sometimes, even Danny the Dog. The same goes about the ""adrenaline"" scenes, or the close camera shots on faces.<br/><br/>I personally believe that V for Vendetta fails to really give to the viewers the high expected feel of emotion or of idealism, though the motive of the rebel story. Moreover, it has a feel of really speeding the story sometimes.<br/><br/>However, V for Vendetta is a really pleasant action film to watch, with good dialogues that make the watcher to think, serving a great scenario about people, governments and rebel in a futuristic aspect.<br/><br/>As for synopsis, V for Vendetta is a good film, but it could have been much better."

","I was pretty excited to see this one, after all the good reviews. But it was somewhat disappointing for me. The world we see is much too black and white, the characters, the set, the gravity the film is set in.<br/><br/>Hugo W. and Natalie are great actors but given clumsy words to express the situation. Overall this film is OK. But it's also much too clean in look, the world is supposed to be dirty and evil, but yet what we see is nothing but pure advertising look images. It's also over explained and by that I mean the producers were most likely thinking that the film was to complicated, which it was not by far.<br/><br/>However, despite this somewhat negative speech, the film is fine, but nothing more than an average flick. But I think the director (It's his first film) has a great and good future, it's a good start, great cast, but the screenplay is what was wrong with this one. Too clean, too neat, too over explained."

Hugo Weaving's voice gives the movie an epic note and Natalie Portman's acting is very reliable. McTeigue's filming is also quite good, not for the exuberance but for the intensity. The rest of the crew is also well known and plays a significant part in the movie. John Hurt, for example, gives the movie a black tonality. His voice and posture helps the viewer to go deeper in the despair spiral. The score music is also a very important because every scene as a sound attached to it.

It is my hope that this and other works will inspire our generation, and those to come, to try to find that delicate balance between autonomy and collective good. Brilliantly executed.

","I'm a very passive movie watcher. I have seen many films and I have seen one film many times. V for Vendetta forced me to stop being passive and make a stand. Too many times I've read reviews on IMDb and have sat there agreeing or sucking my teeth in disagreement but now on the third and very critical viewing of V I can see no wrong. I first saw V 6 months ago and it has had this effect that I no longer just sit in meetings umm-ing and err-ing about proposals offered. I no longer sit in front of looming problems with this laissez-faire attitude of well ... it will sort itself out in the end. I began to stand up and I began to take more 'positive action' in things around me. And yes - I did oppose some things that people proposed and although my actions were in no way violent they became actions against the flow of the recent PC ""If you're not with us, you're against us"" attitude that has been a strong influence on our common society recently. V for Vendetta is a brilliantly timed film. It shows how the present media abuse the 'fear' card and how easily the common man(/woman) are taken in by that media. It shows how much power the media really has. Anyone of you reading this who works for any media organisation and who has seen V for Vendetta, please look in that mirror and take stock. Could you not be doing a better job? In the same way that the Atomic bomb site in Hiroshima shows what does happen when an enormous bomb gets dropped on a city, V for Vendetta shows what happens when a censored press just toes the line of the governing body - People should not be afraid of the government ... The government should be afraid of their people."
"OttoVonB","8","1","3","6 September 2006"," Orwell for the new century.
","In a near-future fascist England perpetually at war, a masked terrorist nicknamed V fights the government that made him, seeking to incite an uprising.<br/><br/>After crumbling under the weight and pretentiousness of their later Matrix episodes, graphic novel fans Larry and Andy Wachowsky hand the reins of a long considered project to their former second unit director. McTeigue surprises pleasantly, showing himself more at ease than his mentors would have been with a very talky script. V is mostly about ideas and the words spoken in it are more inspiring/terrifying than the actions.<br/><br/>V the character remains masked throughout the film, a detail that might disturb certain viewers, but is essential. This is so he can remain, in his eyes as in those of others, an idea rather than a mortal. Mortals die, ideas do not. Natalie Portman is quite generic, she could be anyone under the right circumstances, which is the whole point, to show that the seeds of submission and of rebellion exist within each of us. What is most chilling about ""V for Vendetta"", however, is its depiction of a quite probable near future. Granted John Hurt's demagogue is a bit to Hitlerian to resemble any modern western leader, but the film doesn't shy away from parallels with what Aemrica, England or most of the West might become if pushed to far. The beauty of V is that rather than play to the crowds and just condemn cartoony villains, it blames the public that allows for these monsters to be created and turns a blind eye in return for the illusion of security.<br/><br/>In these confused times, where the public is constantly being brainwashed by single-perspectives and rallies unquestioningly to the flag, ""V for Vendetta"" is a very fitting update of George Orwell's message.<br/><br/>That is manages to also be unique and hugely entertaining as a film is just another welcome bonus. The most intelligent blockbuster since... The Matrix."

","Hugo Weaving is brilliant, versatile and extremely talented. No other Actor could have been cast as 'V' The perfectly spoken word, soft, gentle and commanding at the same time. His movements and actions, the slight tilt of his head, his stance, spoke a thousand words where no dialog could have done justice. Every woman would fall in love with his character 'V'. Natalie Portman who plays 'Evey Hammond' is a rising star in her own right. Her talents shine in this movie I hope she continues with roles that will bring out her talent further. One thing I would like to strongly urge to all Film Companies in the USA. Please lower the background Music. It is too loud. Most movies that are being released today you can not hear the voices of the Actors speaking over the sound of the background music, and this totally ruins the whole movie."
"bgordo81","8","1","3","20 August 2006"," V for Vendetta: Very Vivid, Vivacious, and Vigorous.
","I think V for Vendetta is a very powerful movie. It takes direct aim at the current policies of the neoconservatives running our and Britain's governments in a way that is dark, yet at times entertaining and uplifting. The government uses manufactured, manipulated acts of terror to keep the populace in a constant state of fear and willingness to give the government even more power to solve a problem that the government itself has caused. A former prison camp inmate and biological warfare test subject, known only as V, wages a witty warfare against the repressive regime that has taken over Britain, using the spirit of Guy Fawkes and the Fifth of November.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like about the movie was its overly left-wing, politically correct stance. In this society, homosexuals are singled out for extermination and those possessing the Koran are shot on sight. I really do not think that this sort of Nazi-type government would be realistic... rather, I would expect those currently repressed by political correctness to be a more realistic target of a regime of this type."

"JoeJames76","9","1","3","14 August 2006"," One of the best films of the year, V is sci-fi at its best!
","There isn't a more thought provoking, timely, or definitive vision of our times than this brilliantly adapted film of the Alan Moore comic book. V for Vendetta explores an England of the near future, that isn't a far stretch from the political climate we currently live in. It exposes the fine line between government policy and government fallacy. It inspires and restores faith in the power of people whose governments no longer serve their interests (a plot point that hits too close to home for this writer's likening, at all levels of government). All the while, the film manages to entertain, intrigue, and enlighten us at the same time.<br/><br/>Great science fiction has always given us moral or political or historical lessons for our time, using the setting of the future as its tool. The film alludes to this when 'V' states: ""A writer uses lies to reveal the truth, while a politician conceals the truth by using lies"" (sorry, that may be misquoted, but the premise remains). The science fiction genre allows us to detach our present day selves from the problems and issues of our time, to become fully immersed in similar themes, albeit in a bleak, futuristic setting. This detachment brings a clearer, cleaner canvas in which to debate and recognize the same issues troubling our world.<br/><br/>The parallels are obvious, and the current political/media rhetoric surrounding ""terrorism"" today isn't shied away from. The Wachowski brothers, who brought us ""The Matrix"" trilogy, infuse Alan Moore's original graphic novel, with current political hot buttons. One character boldly states, ""One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter"". This point sums up the crux that exists and drives both this film and our current news and political climate.<br/><br/>Perhaps what is the most triumphant feature of this film, is how all of this is packaged within a very stylistic, extremely well directed action thriller. Though not ""action packed"", the film moves along nicely, powered by a beautiful score by Dario Marianelli who is equally adept at propelling you along and keeping you in suspense. Extremely strong performances by the entire cast should not be ignored come Oscar time.<br/><br/>Indeed, Natalie Portman gives her best performance since ""Leon: The Professional"", (""Closer"" notwithstanding) and perhaps felt some of her own liberation from the shackles of George Lucas' horrible writing and directing of Star Wars Episodes one through three. Hugo Weaving gives an astounding performance, even without the use of facial expressions. His inflection and delivery make what could have been a clown into a convincing cinematic character. Finally, the always fabulous yet understated Stephen Rea does more with his own facial expressions than most actors do with an entire page of dialog.<br/><br/>This film is a must see and certainly requires multiple viewings. Don't wait until the 5th of November to rent this one.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","I almost did not see this movie. I hated the Matrix films and as this movie was being advertised ""From the makers of the Matrix trilogy"" I avoided seeing it. I think the makers truly believed they were creating a piece that would appeal to a predominately male audience (the way they kept advertising Natalie Portman as the star), Matrix lovers and Sci Fi geeks and thus advertised it as such. That, along with the R rating stopped a lot of people from seeing this movie. I cannot remember what finally made me see it but I was fully prepared to hate it when I did. What can I say, I have never been so affected by a movie - a character - in all my life. Hugo Weaving is a genius. I did not know it was he playing V, till the end of the movie. I was simply blown away by his performance. Every aspect of this movie is spellbinding - the set, the music, the costumes, the artwork, the choreography, the direction, the mask. I have never seen anything as beautiful as that mask. Even the horribly violent get mesmerisingly beautiful fight scene at the end left me speechless and my heart thumping. Not to mention the tragic - but you would not have it any other way - ending! Magnificent! I ended up seeing this movie 7 times at the cinema, each time seeing something more, a new spark, a new symbolism that I had not noticed before. This movie leaves you wanting more (a sequel a prequel?) but knowing sadly, that there could never be more, because the heart and soul of this movie - codename V is gone forever. To bring him back somehow would destroy all he worked for, the very symbols he represented. Viva la revolution!"

Like the plot of ""The earl of Monte Christo"" by Albert Camus, we have a man in this story that fate played very foul on. Therefore, he summons up his strengths to overcome the bad powers and to bring justice finally into the light. The film is a mixture of the following topics: action/fighting - political messages - - love story. Due to the clothing, there are even scents of medieval in it. Music is well done and suits the dramatic development in the film perfectly. The film shows very well that it is important to over-think your role in society and that not all means justify the goals to achieve. Yet, YOU can achieve something among us, in our society. You have a voice, two hands and a brain to fight for a good justice. But think carefully about the means that you use for your goals. The film - hopefully - also achieves to let many people think over the actual role of media in our world. Do we really want television and radio to broadcast the way they do at the moment? The final message of the film is a very human one: embrace tolerance and do not trust people who build their power on beliefs of totalitarian law and order."

Portman's acting is excellent, and is supported by her convincing, relatively posh, English accent. <br/><br/>There are obvious references to the current international political scene that neatly bridge the link to Fawkes' gunpowder plot many centuries earlier, explaining why Weaving's character wears this particular mask (though this is done without any reference to the greater religious rather than political motivation of Fawkes' gunpowder plot); but despite this, the film can be enjoyed as is by anyone without a shred of interest in current affairs or who are ignorant of the motivations behind Fawkes gunpowder plot - in short, there's plenty of action to keep anyone interested.<br/><br/>I have one personal gripe with this film in that there are multiple occasions where the terms British and English are used somewhat confusingly. From watching the film, it must be assumed that England has (at some point in the near future) gained political independence from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. An example is the frequent use of the phrase ""England prevails"" that is broadcast by the 'British Television Network' with images of the United Kingdom parliament in the background. Admittedly the now UK parliament was still the English and Welsh parliament at the time of Guy Fawkes, despite the English and Scottish crowns having already united, but things do change and so should the film industry with them!"

","The neocon reviewers don't get it. This is not a movie about the US government today. They hate this movie because it shows where this government is leading us. ""V"" is a true hero because the government he fights is unambiguously evil. We are not there, yet. This movie is merely a warning. It ask us to ""look ourselves in the mirror"" and not let our fears override our values. The dangers we face from terrorists are real, but also the fear mongering and deception of this government are real. That's the only way to explain how something as un-American and un-patriotic as the ""Patriot Act"" (""Articles of Allegiance"" in the movie) can get that name and be accepted by the citizens of our country. We as a nation are sure to face new attacks from terrorists, but we should never renounce our liberty for the sake of security. As Benjamin Franklin said: ""He who sacrifices freedom for security deserves neither"". Maybe the intentions of the neocons are good, but as ""V"" says: ""I'm not here for what you hoped for, I'm here for what you did""<br/><br/>++Spoiler Warning++ The movie itself is brilliant, the dialogue stupendous. In real life walking around quoting Shakespeare may be pedantic, but in a movie with a subtext about the power of words it's more than appropriate and actually enjoyable. ""V"" is a flawed hero, driven more by the desire for vengeance than by ideals, but idealistic never the less. He realizes his shortcomings; he has became a monster and tells Evey as much in the climactic scene: ""You are right about what I've become, there is no tree at the end for me"". In other words, there can be no happy ending for ""V"", no tree to climb with his love like Edmund Dantes. The genius of that scene is that it makes the movie morally consistent. In the end with the announced destruction of Parliment ""V"" just gives the people the opportunity to lose their fear of the government and reclaim their freedom, but it still takes the will and civil courage of the people to actually walk the streets to take back the liberty taken from them. This is a ""movie a clef"" and as a metaphor is simply perfect and should be seem for what it is ... a warning."
"Antagonisten","7","1","3","13 August 2006"," A pleasant surprise
","I didn't know what to expect from this movie really. That the Wachowski-brothers produced it didn't really tell me anything. Somehow i have the feeling that the first Matrix-movie was more or less the highpoint of their creativity, the sequels were definite disappointments and beside their visual sense they are not a reason for me to watch a movie any more.<br/><br/>I guess more than anything i watched this expecting an action-movie. This is something else though. Sure there are a few action sequences in the movie and generally they are reasonably well-made (although not really very spectacular). So if it's not an action-movie, what is it? Well, it felt to me like some sort of mix between Orwell's ""1984"" and a superhero-comic. Much of the time the movie is devoted to semi-philosophical discussions about the value of freedom and views on justice. I guess this might put some people off, not least because it's always odd to see someone wearing an expressionless mask talk so much.<br/><br/>The fascist-future thing has been done so many times in my opinion that i had a hard time seeing what news ""V for Vendetta"" could actually bring to the table. But still it's not a bad take on the genre, and the fact that it's very distinctly British helps as well to separate it from the pack. There are quite a lot of clichÃ©s (not least when it comes to the dictator and his appearance) but i could stomach most of them. The acting in the movie is OK and Hugo Weavings voice is enough filled with expression to make up for the lack of facial movement or other expressions.<br/><br/>I guess whether you will like this or not depends on how much quasi-philosophical discussions you can accept, especially when these discussions happen where most people would expect blazing guns. In that respect it's much like the Matrix-sequels in that it's less action and more talking. The difference in my opinion is that ""V for Vendetta"" is a better movie for it while the Matrix-sequels lost all their appeal without the fast pace and gun ballet. I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie and i think many others were too. The fact that the result had very little to do with my expectations just heightened the positive feelings. Recommended."

","Finally, an intelligent SciFi movie! V for Vendetta does not spoon feed you information or dole it out slowly to add suspense to the plot. It actually assumes prior knowledge on the part of the viewer. A movie needs to be entertaining and captivating. But a good film must also challenge the viewer. It must make the viewer dredge up long forgotten knowledge. And, most importantly, it must force the viewer to make a judgment or form an opinion. V for Vendetta does not simply assume that the US is the do all and end all of modern civilization. The US is vulnerable to the same trials and tragedies as any other nation or society on earth. My knowledge of Hugo Weaving has been limited to the ""Matrix"" films and ""LOTR"", and I have considered him to be somewhat monochromatic. I now admire his reach and versatility. I have followed Natalie Portman since ""Leon, The Professional"" and consider this to be her best since that marvelous breakthrough performance."

"thornugc","10","1","3","11 August 2006"," Instant Classic
","A remarkable work of art that keeps you clued to the screen the entire movie. Although I do see a political message in the movie I was able to watch it for the pure entertainment value and was please. The movie was a collection of emotions and action and special effects with a story that is as strong as steel.<br/><br/>V is the masked man who sets out to give the people a chance to change their surroundings by fighting the system. He is called a terrorist however my definition of a terrorist is one who wishes to make a political or religious statement by attacking civilians of a nation. V does not attack civilians he attacks those who are in power and are corrupt. Yes he is a murderer but not a terrorist.<br/><br/>This movie touches on certain subjects either directly or indirectly. One is Christianity. I have seen reviews where people call this an anti-Christian movie and I have to disagree. It is true that there are those who use God as a way of pushing their agenda and that is what is portrayed here. It is not an outright attack on Christians; it simply shows that some in power who are corrupt try to hide behind a religion. This subject is indirect in the movie and is not really pushed in your face. Another subject is homosexuality. There are those who say this is pro-homosexual and I can say yes and no to that. My personal belief is that homosexuality is wrong but I do not believe that those who are gay should be treated similar to the Jews during the Second World War. The movie shows that gays were locked away and had experiments performed on them. That is wrong no matter what. Again the issue is not pushed in your face but is directly addressed in the movie. There are other issues as well such as sacrificing freedoms for security. That is a real issue in this world today and in the movie it is taken to the extreme to show what could be if a regime takes control in a currently free nation.<br/><br/>Issues aside this movie was well directed and the set pieces and soundtrack is top notch. The story is top of the line and the actors are perfect for their roles. I do believe this movie will be remembered for years and years as one of the best movies ever.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman does her best acting to date. Her acting in Star Wars made me wonder if she could really act, she redeems herself in this movie.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving was the perfect man to be V. His voice is very distinct and fits well with his character. Hugo is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>Stephen Rea is an actor who I am not familiar with although he was in Interview with a Vampire. I do not think anyone could have done a better job for the part.<br/><br/>This is a movie I recommend for those who enjoy a great story presented in a very entertaining way."

","I really enjoyed this movie. I wanted to see it ever since the trailer, but never got around to seeing it in theaters. I waited until it came out on DVD and I became fascinated with it immediately. I heard some people bash it because of the lack of action involved. I cannot disagree more. The movie all around was excellent despite it being an adaptation. I enjoyed the movie so much that I went out a couple days later and purchased the book which contains every comic book written. I am currently in the process of reading it, and I am appreciating the movie even more that I see the changes in the role of characters. David Lloyd was right for endorsing this movie and I agree with him for that because this film would have taken way too long if it stuck with the origins of the comic books. Overall, I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anyone."

Three Quarters of an actors style is deleted with a mask. But he gets it perfect, and it is a very different role for Hugo.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was fantastic too. I am very happy an a English cast and crew can make such an amazing film.<br/><br/>I am not a big comic mad-man but i am sure this has stayed true to the Graphic Novel that it came from.<br/><br/>This is my second favourite film of all time.

"alexbond3","6","1","3","9 August 2006"," V for Vendetta
","V for Vendetta creates a vision of the year 2020 in London: the British government is ruled by a fascist dictator, there is omnipresent surveillance and a strictly-enforced curfew for all citizens. The state television station spits fear-mongering propaganda that is fed to a TV in every household. Government goons break into houses to haul off homosexuals, Muslims, racial minorities and political dissenters, and lock them up in camps for medical testing. Who will stand up against the oppression? His name is V, and he wears a mask with the face of Guy Fawkes, the 17th century Briton who attempted to blow up King James I and the Houses of Parliament. V is a terrorist, and we meet him on the 400th anniversary of the night Guy Fawkes' plot was foiled  the night he plans to blow up the Old Bailey courtrooms.<br/><br/>Earlier in the night, V saves a young woman, Evey, after she unwisely attempts to break curfew and runs into a group of policemen intent on harming her. V forces her to join him, and they both watch as the Old Bailey explodes to the tune of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture broadcasting over the city loudspeakers. Days later, V seizes control of the state television station and vows to strike against the dictatorship again on the same night one year later, petitioning the oppressed public to march in support on that day. For the next 12 months, the film follows V as he trains Evey to become his partner in leading the revolt.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is the latest film from the Wachowski brothers, who famously wrote and directed the the Matrix trilogy. Unfortunately for us, their newest effort is more similar to the second and third Matrix films than the first."
"discord_the_lunatic","6","1","3","8 August 2006"," A good action movie, but for fans of the comic, a harmless ""Vendetta""
","As the second (and less comic-like) treatment the Wachowskis wrote for Alan Moore & David Lloyd's socio-political commentary masterpiece ""V For Vendetta"", the movie adaptation plays fast and loose with almost all of the stories major elements -- to the extent that Moore successfully lobbied to have his name removed from the credits. They leave behind a film that has so little in common with its source material that only a few characters and V's ever-present mask and knives are left -- mostly -- intact.<br/><br/>I will state for the record that I don't believe a more perfect V could have been cast. For a die-hard fan of the book(such as myself), Hugo Weaving's performance is one of the few truly bright spots. Natalie Portman's Evey Hammond is - and as a fan of Natalie's it pains me to say this - not one of her better roles, but she does her best with the material she's given. Given this script, unfortunately, even Weaving stumbles on occasion, with his five-minutes-into-the-film rant containing a rundown of several dozen words starting with the letter ""V"" leaving me sitting slack-jawed in horror.<br/><br/>Simply put, changing the conditions and story of the book to turn it into a movie was necessary, and yet; too much of the original story was left out and new material brought in. While this will always be a complaint lobbied against any film adapted from comic material, the point is more valid in this case than most others. ""V"" isn't the X-Men, with 40-odd years and nearly as many creative minds involved; it was done by two men who set out to tell a gripping, haunting story. Moore & Lloyd succeeded beyond their wildest expectations. The Wachowskis and McTeigue just make another ""action movie with a message"". This is the main flaw of the film, and what keeps it from ranking any higher in my opinion.<br/><br/>While virtually all of the cast give good-to-great performances, there is very rarely any feeling developed for them. And the film's butchering of the books ending simply makes no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>If you haven't read ""V For Vendetta"", then it can't hurt to watch this first. But if you HAVE read it, consider yourself fairly warned: this is not a movie 'based on', it is definitely 'adapted from'."
"victor7754","7","1","3","6 August 2006"," A Romanic View of an Individual verses Government
","James McTeigue directed V for Vendetta, a film about an individual who is brave enough to stand up against the oppressive new global government. Surveillance cameras are everywhere therefore, having a good time is forbidden unless permitted. V for Vendetta is produced in a time where the 21st generation is questioning 9-11. Was it someone trying to get personal revenge on the Western Government or someone trying to get revenge for deceiving society, yet let them believe that they are living in comfort? Was it over opium? I mean pharmaceuticals... V for Vendetta is produced during the Bush Administration Era: 2000-2008. Bush's reign produced the Iraqi War to help rid the world of Weapons of Mass Destruction. Osama Bin Ladin laid claim as the leader of Al Queda to the destruction of The World Trade Center. Only if there were fire works when the jets smashed into the Two Towers.<br/><br/>V is a graphic novel brought to screen. It's entertaining as it reminds us of past dictatorships based on an ideology. The Government of America wants to convince the world of Globalization and prosperity for the individual. It is a destructive and evil nature to seek, for it makes the individual spiteful of their plights.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is an attractive female caught up in the world of V, the individual for freedom. The film romanticizes terrorism, as if it is a cause to philosophize about. Who are these terrorists anyway? It's so vague isn't it? Maybe the truth is hard for a comfortable nation. It was for Germany as they ignored a holocaust.<br/><br/>Too bad the intellect of the individual is not examined. V for Vendetta is a bourgeoisie chat fest over a few drinks and a joint. The film tries to convince that it knows a deeper secret, yet it fails to convince. 9/11 was a serious attempt at telling us that we need to see the whole and step outside the box. V for Vendetta is helping us see beyond the walls, it wants us to suffer for the consequences of capitalism, a world void of feeling. What's the purpose of history?"

That said, the film has merrit. The plot is good, but perhaps too blatantly over-the-top for most people.<br/><br/>I admit the acting was average. The script as well. But I can't help it. It achieved in me a catharsis I haven't had in a while. I can't in good faith NOT recommend anyone to watch this, given the climate of the world today. Watch, get angry, and get involved.<br/><br/>If you watched this and got angry for another reason, because you feel it was too one sided, or left-wing, or betrayed family values, or communistic, or felt that the film should be banned....good. It gives me pleasure that the people it should have offended, were."
"volvorottie","10","1","3","4 August 2006"," Tremendously important film
","I consider this the best film I've seen so far this year. The messages of a fascist government run amok, terrorizing citizens, manipulating the news by creating false stories planted to divert attention from what's really going on, and a leader who's imperialism derives from a somnolent, lazy populace. Sounds familiar? It is - it's the US today.<br/><br/>Like Orwell's 1984 and his other writings on the topics of governments suppressing people in ways big and small, this film gets right to the point: anarchy is useful at the point at which people have lost all power to control their leaders and violence must be utilized to fight back. Of course, this leads the corrupt leadership to declare anyone not on the same page a ""terrorist"". And we all know how terrorists are dealt with - secret prisons, no trials, tremendous abuse, murder and dumping you into a hole where you'll never be found again.<br/><br/>As for the actual actors themselves in this piece, Natalie Portman finally has given a performance that reminds me of the superb talent I saw all those years ago in ""The Professional"" w/Jean Reno & Gary Oldman. This is the Natalie Portman I've been waiting to see again, in a dark set piece, where her talent to disappear into the role and become Evey works on pretty much every level.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving, the ominous Agent Smith of the Matrix trilogy and of course the Elf King, Elrond, is terrific as V. The mask he wears may hide his face, but the inflections of his voice, his body language and his humanity come shining through nonetheless. A brilliant actor who's highly underrated - this guy deserves an Oscar yesterday! V for Vendetta reminds us that it's so terribly easy to slide into a fascist leadership - all it takes is for we the populace to become placid, lazy, lax in who we elect and fearful. The largest component of this slide is FEAR - and a corrupt leadership will use it at every single turn. Hence we get SARS, Avian Flu, WMD which do not exist in Iraq, global warming, you name it. By keeping us afraid and cowering the government can do pretty much what it wants. And this Administration, like that in the film, seeks to become not a government with checks and balances, but one of imperialism enforced with violence, surveillance, monitoring and well armed forces. Though written as an indictment of the Thatcher regime in the UK, in the 1980's, the film basically deals with the same themes that plague ""democracies"" today - corruption, self-dealing, secretiveness at all costs and keeping the populace under control at all times using charged language such as ""terrorist"" to describe anyone who seeks to invoke change for the better.<br/><br/>This film is a warning. If you fail to heed it's important message, then you deserve to lose the freedom you don't have the smarts to cherish at all costs."

"Bologna King","9","1","3","2 August 2006"," Lots to Think About
","It is a characteristic of great art that it gives one a lot to think about. This film is no exception. There are reflections here of 1984, Brazil, and the Phantom of the Opera, but the story told here is not any of the above. It is also highly literate with constant allusions to and quotations from classic writers (especially Shakespeare). Here are some of the points to ponder: 1. What does the mask represent? Is it V's persona as a terrorist? Is it to make him an abstraction or an embodied idea? Or an Everyman? (Evey's comment at the end of the film reinforces this) A romantic relationship with a man in a mask (as in Phantom) probes questions of how much you need to know about someone before making an emotional commitment.<br/><br/>2. How do fascist states work? We see a lot of familiar themes here: the brutal secret police, torture, restriction of civil liberty, censorship and propaganda. All very intentionally topical and a comment on the rise of fascism especially in the US. But behind that is the reiteration that the basis of the fascist state is fear: fear of terrorists, epidemic diseases and so on, that allow the government to justify using its repressive means and to perpetuate the fear. How does one escape the domination of fear? What kind of personal apotheosis is that? What does it enable one to do?<br/><br/>3. What is a terrorist? How does that differ from a freedom fighter? Is terrorism acceptable in some cases? Is hijacking a television network in order to bypass censors and make a speech a terrorist act? What is the difference between justice and revenge? Which one is V after?<br/><br/>4. Stephen Fry's character Gordon is a lot like V but a lot different as well. The contrast is interesting.<br/><br/>Aaah, this sounds too much like school notes; see the film--it will raise all of these issues and more in a much more interesting way than I could."
"oneloveall","7","1","3","31 July 2006"," Embrace the essence
","Moving philosophical action movie does not disappoint, although is clearly in need of a trim. While the primary theme of rebellion can at it's best be cathartic, and the relationship between it's two principle characters fascinating and inspiring, as usual the Wachowski's overpower their themes with unnecessary exposition, subplots that deter rather then add, and dialog delivered that still feels like it comes from the page in it's profound, but showman-like and detached nature. What saves Vendetta from all these pratfalls however is the heavy handed yet accessibly executed instigation behind the essence of what one yearns for when they yearn to be free. In that, Alan Moore, Wachowski's, and Hugo Weaving have etched into his character V the most compelling, larger then life character since Tyler Durden. To all those who would rather embrace an ideal rather then mull over minor distractions, enjoy this film's core. And by enjoy I mean be affected by it in a way that produces any tiny amount of physical change in our world."

","V FOR VENDETTA is a nicely realized adaptation of an old graphic novel by Alan Moore. V (Hugo Weaving) is a Zorro-like character who defends the weak and punishes the corrupt regime that rules the people. Set in near-future England, V takes on the entire British government, run with an iron first by a sickly-looking John Hurt. A very sharp detective played by Stephen Rea is close on V's heels, and a lovely young innocent played by Natalie Portman becomes V's devoted ally. V is a terrorist, but a sympathetic one as he goes about blowing up buildings and battling cops and soldiers. V FOR VENDETTA also has a little bit of Batman and the Scarlet Pimpernel in it, and the ever-disguised hero has fashioned his ""new"" life from THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. The movie falters midway when Portman is imprisoned and tortured for a lengthy period, but picks up again for a slam-bang finale as V and Portman plot to blow up Parliament. A little more action and a bit less talking might have raised this B-flick to A-status. As it is, not bad for a movie adapted from a comic book."

Of course, the topic of this movie is good and intriguing, still it didn't rock my mind like, for example ""Equilibrium"". The best way I can describe what I felt when watching this is that I constantly felt like I was looking at a great play from behind a dirty window. It just didn't suck me in. <br/><br/>To get back to the grounds ""already tread and better"": Equilibrium, if you have not yet seen it, waste no more time.

","""V for Vendetta"" is the best movie I have seen after a while. The movie has everything: action, excitement, drama, romance etc. so it is more than enjoyable. The Wachowski brother have made it again. Even if the director (James McTeigue) has changed since ""The Matrix trilogy"" the touch of the Wachowski brothers still lingers.<br/><br/>In the film there can be seen the unique art form of the brothers like in ""The Matrix"" which was its time's ground breaker. ""V for Vendetta"" has the same kind of eye for the details but it is not as action-packed than ""The Matrix"". The fight scenes are made with good taste but this time there is no floating in the air. The dagger-swinging ""V"" does it with style and does not shed blood in the disturbing way.<br/><br/>The fact the makers made the future look like the 19th century London made a huge impression. Also the clever time solution made me cheer. As I said the Wachowski brother's have the eye of the details. Their film-making is very artistic and that is the fact their pictures are so beautiful and impressive.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" gives us an insight what the world would look a couple of years forward. I think the world might turn out to be a little bit like the world in the Wachowskies film. The non-stopping attacks, wars and exploitation are not helping to get us anywhere save place. Before we can even say nothing there is a night curvier. If the revenging does not come to its end soon it's no longer save to go out after ten o'clock. Another thing is the bigotry and hatred to the minorities. If it doesn't stop people will start to haunt each other down like the Nazi's did to Jews at the World War two. The film is very insightful and full with hidden subjects of the world today.<br/><br/>The acting is high quality, once again. Natalie Portman shines and she is to become one of the most brilliant actress of her generation. The Wachowskies favorite Hugo Weaving (behind the mysterious mask of ""V"") makes an outstanding performance. It takes a lot to carry the mask and make it look various. Weaving does a really great job! The appearances of Stephen Rea and John Hurt were important, too.<br/><br/>The ""V"" really represent all of us. I share the same opinion and philosophy: ""People should not be afraid of their government. Goverments should be afraid to their people"". I recommend the film to anybody who can keep an open mind. In that case the legacy of the film will fulfill itself."

","If I did'nt accidentally see Hugo weiving being interviewed on some stupid talk show on TV, I would've never guessed or at least have some difficulty in guessing that he played V. Unfortunately if you go surfing the net, this revelation is also likely to pop up when you click on some link or movie preview. His acting has really been unbeatable in this movie. To think that he was also agent Smith is truly amazing. The movie itself is pretty good and highly refined. You may be expecting a lot of action scenes and a few more could have possibly been added. Its not as if they could'nt come up with a few new ideas if they wanted to? The only problem in this movie are that the writers are way too obsessed with current political issues, way too obsessed with muslims and even more obsessed with homosexuality, as ideas fit for oppression by a dictatorship. These concepts have'nt been illustrated with any subtlety and seem too intentional."
"brodie_kashmir","6","1","3","10 July 2006"," Had the most potential of all films this year, and it was squandered
","In 1983, Alan Moore wrote his seminal graphic novel, ""V for Vendetta."" That future was 1997. Now, 23 years after the book and nine years after the time the book was set, Andy and Larry Wachowski, the men behind ""The Matrix"" trilogy, bring us ""V for Vendetta."" Set in Britain sometime in the 2020s after America has fallen from supremacy and Britain is a powerful police state, ""V for Vendetta"" tells the tale of V (Hugo Weaving), a vigilante clad in cloak, cap and Guy Fawkes mask, as he recruits Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) to join him in bringing down the fascist regime. His tactics involve blowing up Parliament, an act which effectively finishes what Guy Fawkes failed to accomplish 400 years ago, kidnapping and killing government workers, and ending with a literal big bang at a famous clock.<br/><br/>Is the movie going public ready for a film which depicts terrorism? Not to mention that the terrorist is the hero. It's only been four and a half years since the events of 9/11, and just nine months since the actual terrorist attacks in London. Its $26 million opening weekend suggests that yes, we are.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"", in its coincidental timeliness (it's been in pre-production for 18 years) sets the stage for the more reality based, but equally topical, ""Flight 93"" due out in April and ""World Trade Center,"" coming to theatres this August, both dealing with the events of 9/11/01.<br/><br/>Weaving is by and large gives one of the best performances of his career as V, the charismatic and Shakespeare quoting rogue that is equal parts D'Artagnan, Lex Luther and, of course, Guy Fawkes. He has to let his voice and body movement convey his emotions and thoughts, as the Fawkes mask he wears throughout the film doesn't afford him the use of facial expression. He has a very distinct and dynamic voice, which he uses to his advantage in this role.<br/><br/>Portman proves that the ""Star Wars"" films were a career fluke and she actually can act. She puts on a British accent for this role and handles the tortured (figuratively and literally) Evey with the poise and skill of a seasoned veteran.<br/><br/>And they both benefit from the amazing supporting cast which includes character actor Stephen Rea as Detective Finch, the aging cop assigned to hunt down V, and John Hurt as the tyrannical dictator.<br/><br/>The Wachowskis produce and write this film; letting protégé and ""Matrix"" second unit director James McTeigue take the helm of this film. Therein lies the problem. Moore had an idea and the vision to carry it out when he created this alternative world. The Wachowskis were able to translate and adapt it to the silver screen and the actors were able to bring it to life. But McTeigue lacks any sort of discernible vision and directs this film with all the standard clichés and mistakes that one would expect from a first time director. For this sort of delicate and weighty subject matter, I'd rather have a more seasoned veteran behind the wheel. The Wachowskis should have directed this one, as there are many thematic similarities between ""V"" and their ""Matrix."" Fortunately the production as a whole does not suffer from McTeigue's uninvolved and lazy approach to the material. It's still an enjoyable action film, with an archaic, yet ironically futuristic, swashbuckling slant to it."
"newren","6","1","3","6 July 2006"," V for Vendetta
","I'd read poor newspaper reviews of this film, but had several friends who were impressed. So finally I relented and went, fearing a gloomy, hard to follow film.<br/><br/>Not at all was it that way. V is a man who indeed has a vendetta, but he is heroic NOT because of what he does, which, in earlier film eras might have been called swashbuckling: a heroic, daring fighter who seems to be reckless but always comes through. He's heroic because of why he does it.<br/><br/>But I only give it a 6 because I saw many 'holes' in the plot. Parts that didn't fit together, as well as unlikely events. To generalise about this remark, without giving anything away, I wonder how, in this fascist state, with so many security personnel and police, V could manage to live as he does and coordinate and pull off so many feats, all the while being untraceable.<br/><br/>Finally I realised that the film is more mythology than just fiction. I see the main points as: be true to your principles and be fearless in doing what is right and serving the higher interests of people.<br/><br/>Mythology doesn't seem overly concerned with the details. Some great literature, such as Greek drama, has gods interfering in human affairs and humans being in unlikely, perhaps illogical, circumstances. But it doesn't make us doubt the story, because we are looking for a higher message, not for a tightly woven plot.<br/><br/>While V is not the most complex hero, he is not all pure and noble, which makes for boring protagonists. His actions are based only partly on noble intentions of freedom for everyone. He also is reVenging the suffering that he had. So he is a bit interesting. And indeed, I wish we could have learnt more about his past, about how he got to where he is. And about who he is now, though the film does strongly suggest why he is in his present, masked, condition.<br/><br/>In this film the higher message is freedom. It does a good job of depicting how a government can manipulate the media and other aspects of society to keep people in fear, to mentally paralyse the people. And it shows, as I believe history does, that any society or nation needs a leader, a hero, to arouse their anger and courage enough to have the fortitude to overthrow tyranny.<br/><br/>Evey is not so convincing to me, but it may be that I have to think more about what she represents. Indeed, in the early part of the film her emotions are not very deep to me, but then that is a stage in her life when she is just trying to fit in, and perhaps understands only the need to be 'one of the crowd'. Later, as she becomes more involved with V, her character seems to come more alive, and also to express more emotional depth.<br/><br/>Other main actors seemed generally to fulfil their roles. Not many of them are challenged by the classic conflict of right or wrong, though at least one lead character who understands right from wrong seems to get off 'easy' in having to decide what is the noblest course to take.<br/><br/>There were shades of Matrix, in the seeming impossibility of the heroes succeeding to the end. But there seemed to be no doubt about who was right. Matrix tempts us to accept that the stronger or higher intelligence does know the answers. V for Vendetta was also a bit reminiscent of Bladerunner, but here V seems superhuman (mythological) in his abilities, and the source of repression or tyranny is more obvious. Some of the battles of fight scenes in V also had shades of innumerable Oriental martial arts films, including Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. But in V, the good guy/bad guy was always more obvious than in many of the martial arts films.<br/><br/>Some of the symbolism was good, some obvious. For example, do you know the last name of the singer of ""Cry Me a River"", which is played throughout this film? The song helped me remember that even super-heroes need a bit of affection."
"omegapenguin77","10","1","3","29 June 2006"," This is honestly the best movie I have seen recently, possibly ever
","This is a movie that intelligently expresses an anti-governmental mindset and thought process while not making some pathetic attempt to keep the audience engaged, the story alone serves to that end there is little if any unnecessary fighting chopped in to keep the action up but if you pay any attention to the plot your interest is invariably captured. if you've read Alan Moore's novel it is slightly disappointing in a few aspects namely the lack of ""bad guy"" character development or explanation for why the compound explodes. however that would necessitate a miniseries rather than a long-running movie they also avoid discussing the fate computer but to those who haven't read the novel nothing seems amiss and to those who have you know that although they do enhance the story they are not necessary details this is a work really on par with George Orwell's 1984 and has a similar story and for anyone with a predisposition against this movie because the main character is a terrorist please try to bear in mind that terrorists are just the good guys on the other side"
"aliceboy","6","1","3","22 June 2006"," An embarrassment to its creator
","In spite of myself, I was completely geeked up about the movie adaptation of one of my favourite comics. I can only blame this on a very effective advertising campaign (the site was neat, the retro design on the posters very attractive and news on the movie hard to come by), since every prior Alan Moore adaptation has suffered horribly at the hands of Hollywood. In addition to which was the directorial debut of an AD from such abominations as the 'Star Wars' prequels and 'The Matrix' trilogy. Still, despite these warning signs, when it was finally time for the movie, I was quite excited. (Regrettably, it was only after seeing it that I heard Moore had disowned the project!) Knowing I'd most likely be disappointed, though, I tried to separate the film from its original source material (which it almost entirely betrays, for some reason) and view it simply as a sci-fi action movie (which I'd almost never watch otherwise). I know: impossible, right? I thought I could do it, and I don't know if I was up to the task. I'll concede that Hugo Weaving was an apt choice for V. He does a nice job with a difficult character, only occasionally descending to hamminess. I was curious to see what Natalie Portman would do with Evey, and was completely let down. She was entirely too attractive for the role of Little Miss Average, and I can never accept her all-too-subtle English accent (this was supposed to be a lower middle class girl, after all, and she plays it like she went to Oxford). I understand that, in order to have an almost all-English cast, the filmmakers had to score some American star power, but surely there could have been someone else (was Jena Malone busy?). McTeigue's direction is all you'd expect it to be: effects heavy and lacking moving artistic perception. I imagine this film looks great in stills, and that's how he (and his mentors the Wachowskis) sets up shots: as images, not as motion. So much of the camera-work -- to say nothing of the effects -- was gratuitous and done solely for 'wow-factor' in a story that would otherwise have been too quite for the mythical American audience to handle. That, it seems, is at the root of the problem with this film: it was engineered, once again, for the eternally underestimated American filmgoing audience. So often, Hollywood betrays sharp original material in pursuit of what is desired by a fictitious audience it's created itself. This only results in the worst kind of movies, and 'V for Vendetta' is a perfect example of this. The original material was fine, and probably as close as Alan Moore will ever have gotten to a made-for-film comic. All it would've taken to make it filmable was to excise some of the enriching subplots (the doctor's story, the homelives of the party members, the 'Evita' style power grab by the wife) and shooting what was left. And it comes close here, but just has to monkey with it. In the end, this was an attractive movie for a dumbed-down audience. I'm constantly shocked by how many people who've read the original book think this is a good adaptation. The movie takes the basic material and ruins it, so I really think it should only be considered on its own. Even in that light, however, this clunker falls flat. Nice mask, though..."

""<br/><br/>Loved it!!!Brilliant!!! <br/><br/>The film was magnificent! Looking at a brutal future which is almost parallel to the events of today, director James McTeigue and the writers (The Wachowski Brothers)did a brilliant job at portraying a world in chaos where ""artists use lies to tell the truth while politicians use them to cover it up."" The cast is brilliant but the most outstanding performance would have to be from Hugo Weaving who is without a doubt the most influential and powerful character in the whole film. Playing an intelligent psychopath Hugo Weaving is amazing, quoting Shakepeare before destroying a building and offering amazing insight at the most critical moments (Beneath this mask there is more than flesh. Beneath this mask there is an idea, Mr. Creedy, and ideas are bulletproof.) Hugo Weaving pulls it off brilliantly. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who likes a good action film which is controversial and thought provoking!!!"

Perhaps because I come from a (former) dictatorship Country (former Yugoslavia) is why this movie has moved me, but I think it's not all about my origin. The movie is very inspiring. It's not about blowing up stuff, and killing people, it's about us, and our society, about our governments and the choices we've made. ""V for Vendetta"" shows what are people really capable of, and their true power when they stand together. Made me think about our world today, and my life...watch it, you'll be amazed."
"jimhills","7","1","3","7 June 2006"," Alphabetical Review
","www.kajatm.com <br/><br/>A for Another, this was Another movie that was good but not great.<br/><br/>B for Bullocks, the word Bullocks is used over and over and over again. Yes I understand you are British and this is a way to swear on screen without getting censored in the US but enough already. This word is getting very close to the word Wicked as my most hated word.<br/><br/>C for Confusing, this movie is often Confusing at times. Everyone speaks in English accents and at times it is hard to follow the dialog. There is one specific scene that is kind of a stretch and it is pretty much the arc of the movie so if you don't buy into it or you get confused as to why the main character did it, it makes the movie kind of confusing.<br/><br/>D for Dave, this is the first movie that I have seen since Dave Chappelle's Block Party so anything after that is going to be a good movie. I cannot express enough how terrible that movie was.<br/><br/>E for Ending, this movie has a great Ending, which I will not ruin but it will let you leave the movie theater very satisfied.<br/><br/>F for Fudge, as in Fudge it is hard to write a review using the entire alphabet.<br/><br/>G for Government, The goal of the movie was to focus on how the Government makes choices that are not in the best intentions of the people but you start to feel that this movie just might be a cut on the US government.<br/><br/>H for Humor, there are some very good lines in this movie which always makes a movie better.<br/><br/>I for Includes. This movie Includes good action, good acting, a good ending, good story line and overall a good viewing experience.<br/><br/>J for Jim, hey it is my review I can give myself a little shout out every once in a while.<br/><br/>K for Killer as in Killer visual effects, Killer fight scenes and a Killer ending.<br/><br/>L for Liked, I Liked this movie but I didn't love it.<br/><br/>M for Mask, the main character V wears a Mask the entire movie which will prompt everyone to go out and buy said mask for their Halloween costumes this year.<br/><br/>N for Not, this movie is Not for everyone. Definitely not a kid movie. There are several scenes that include blood spurting and killing.<br/><br/>O for Oh. Oh this movie was good but I was hoping that it would be great. Worth seeing but not worth purchasing and that is where I draw the line between great and good.<br/><br/>P for Please don't make this into a Trilogy cause I don't think I can sit through another 2+ hour move that doesn't live up to the first two. Or a movie that pretty much makes the main character into Christ.<br/><br/>Q for Quality, both Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving have Quality performances in this movie. The only thing is that I was expecting was for Hugo to look at the Audience and say ""Mr. Anderson"" R for Rather. It was Rather nice to see this movie without paying for it. How did this happen? Well let me tell you. Ken and I invested some internet time in filling out an application for an AMC Movie Watcher Card. If you live by an AMC theater I would high recommend filling out the online application. You get cool stuff by using it like free movies and discounts on concessions.<br/><br/>S for Start, I am officially making this movie the Start of the summer movie season which means no more garbage movies from Hollywood like I had to see throughout February and March.<br/><br/>T for Thanks, Thanks to DC comics and Marvel comics to signing deals with motion picture companies to turn their comics into feature films. Keep it up.<br/><br/>U for Under-appreciated, Movies like V for Vendetta are often Under-appreciated because they don't teach us a moral lesson or they don't teach us something about history or they aren't about some obscure person that you don't care about. This is a good movie where you can just check your brain at the door and be at the movie for the reason you went there in the first place and that was to be entertained.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta, did you expect me to come up with a different V.<br/><br/>W for Wachowski. The Wachowski brothers have put out another quality movie which makes 3 out of their last 4 movies very good. Let's all just pretend that the last Matrix was never created.<br/><br/>X for X-Treme, This movie has X-Treme action from beginning to end. (I'd like to thank ESPN and all the skaters out there that decided to spell the word extreme with an X. Without that this review would not be possible.) Y for Yippee. Before the movie started we got not only a preview of the new Superman movie but we also got previews for MI3 and X-Men 3. So Yippee the summer block buster season is almost upon us which means no more snow, stuff going on during the weekends, summer festivals and most important softball.<br/><br/>Z for Zee, OK see doesn't start with a Z but just imagine that I am using a French accent right now. I would recommend seeing this movie at the theater if not only just to see it because of the sound factor. Seeing a movie like this at home will just not give it justice. Overall I was satisfied with my viewing experience but I wouldn't recommend you putting down whatever you are doing right now to go out and see it but if you have nothing else going on by all means make a trip to the Theater. But then again what do I know?"
"lamer76","6","1","3","2 June 2006"," Fun to watch, but nothing more.
","You have to give it to the Wachowski brothers (the writers); they do know how to entertain. But shallow entertainment is all you get out of this completely naive portrayal of totalitarian Britain post-9/11, post-bird flu, post-disintegration of America, post-closure of all underground stations in London. The country is now ruled by a dictator (Hurt) whose only source of power is numbing people with fear of basically everything around them. And for some reason, it seems that the only form of evil government to be found is an exact replica of the Nazi regime. If only the brothers could open their eyes just a little bit, they can see the making of totalitarian governments that abuse people's fears for individual gains all around them.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of assimilated Evey (Portman) who encounters the masked and courageous V (Weaving) when he rescues her from a fate worse than death. V is actually a ""terrorist"" who blows things up, among other atrocities, in order to wake the people of Britain from their slumber and remind them that their government is meant to serve them and not the other way round. Evey slowly unlocks the secrets of this mysterious man, uncovering corruption and unspeakable acts that consequently expose her real self.<br/><br/>Although Weaving and Fry (as Dietrich) give charming performances, I am still baffled by the choice of Natalie Portman as Evey. Even if the casting director was forced to put in an American actress in order to boost box office returns, couldn't she at least have picked someone who can speak with a British accent? Anyway the movie is actually fun to watch. Just don't expect anything more out of it."

","I admit that i am glad I watched this movie. I went 2 weeks ago with my girlfriend, who hates action films and we were astonished by the sheer quality of this film in all aspects. The film is very well directed, especially the action scenes are spectacular. And also the figure of V is something alien but at the same time very friendly and ""close"". As the film is progressing towards the end we all feel that we have a friend, V, who will protect us against the evils of any totalitarian lunatic running our world. The political point of the film is obvious and it represents the opinion of the majority of people in modern societies who want to speak but actually can't. Oppressive dogmas and governments covered with the veil of ""democracy"" and ""freedom"" have taken our free will to decide what to do with our lives. Only greed and evil prevail in modern societies of the so called ""civilised western world"". V is their menace.<br/><br/>The film is more a political opinion than an action movie and I am very honored to have watched it. The plot, the cast and the script are Marcellus.

"charchuk","6","1","3","29 May 2006"," Lots of potential but ultimately disappoints
","A film that had so much potential and, sadly, falls short. Both thematically and technically it is flawed, leading to a disappointing result. Still, it is decently well-made and intriguing at times, but ultimately it is crushed under the weight of its message. I couldn't help but be reminded of 1984 constantly throughout the film, and kept contrasting this film to the Orwell novel. There is no question in my mind that the novel is far superior - it deals with similar issues in a much more subtle (and effective) manner. There is no superheroes to be found in 1984. Unfortunately, the same can not be said of this film, and that is its downfall.<br/><br/>The basic story is too clichéd to really make an impact, and it is even further bogged down by pointless sub-plots (I found the 'lesbian fairy tale' to be utterly pointless and do nothing but slow the pace down) and numerous dead ends. Too many questions were left unanswered for the film, and its message, to make a powerful impact. There are some interesting ideas at work here (I liked the notion of the United States being embroiled in a second civil war) but they are poorly handled. The characters are mostly stock heroes or villains (the masked vigilante, the damsel in distress, the cop looking for redemption, the evil dictator) but the actors fill out the roles nicely. Weaving, though we don't see his face, does a great job with the dialogue, and Portman is good. Of the supporting actors, Rea is by far the best, making his character quite believable. All in all, though, the theme of the movie is lost amongst the action scenes and confusing story.<br/><br/>The budget was lower than I would have thought, and it showed on the screen. Some of the visual effects were nice (especially the final shot of the Parliament buildings blowing up) but the sound mixing is simply dreadful, sometimes so bad that you can't hear the actors talk. The directing is merely adequate, and the editing is faulty sometimes. And the action scenes were far too Matrix-y for my liking. Try something new, Wachowskis.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a good film, but something felt off throughout it. I can't put my finger directly on it, but it's ""like a splinter in my mind, driving me mad"". The acting was good at times and not at others, the dialogue ranged from superb to downright cheesy, and the technicalities of the film wavered horribly. I guess the best word to describe this film is inconsistent. Still, it was well-made and thought-provoking, and that is enough for me to give it a B."

","(I'm not very good at writing reviews so I'll try to express myself in the simplest way possible) These days, with all the leftist propaganda films that are being stuffed down our throats, I thought I'b be relieved by watching this movie, which, on the outside looks like a fun, exciting action flick-you know, like the Matrix. But on the inside it is a demonstration of leftist corruption and immorality that is making a living hell out of this planet.<br/><br/>Sure, it's fun to watch, it has good actors, excellent special effects, and witty, humorous dialogue...hell, it's a very good flick to watch for fun. But I cannot understand why homosexuality and terrorism are encouraged, let alone the blatant anti-religion bulls*** with the priest (spoiler, see the movie). Sure, I wouldn't like to live in the society represented in the plot, but I sure as hell don't want my son becoming a socialist pig after seeing this.<br/><br/>Watch this for fun, forget the message. I can at least give it a 5 because I was entertained. -5 for being directed by communist b**tards. But that's just MY opinion, I'll let you judge it on your own."

One of those rare films that combines great acting, special effects, a gripping and interesting plot and a truly sinister and topical atmosphere.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman was excellent as usual and had a couple of scenes that really showed how talented an actress she is (the scene where she comes out of captivity and into the rain sent a shiver down my spine). I also thought Hugo Weaving managed to get across a lot of emotion and feeling from his character despite the fact we never even saw his face.<br/><br/>The special effects were also superb. It's not very often you see something now that can make you sit up and take notice but the final scene was a bit special and a couple of the fights were masterfully handled as well. Of course watching it at the Imax helped a lot and I would highly recommend it (obviously).<br/><br/>I also found the subject matter and ideas behind it to be very disturbing and apart from the 'religious fanaticism' angle i thought it really was quite a plausible 'day after tomorrow' scenario and all the scarier for it.<br/><br/>Overall the unique style and boldness of the film made it stand out for me and i found it very enjoyable and thought-provoking.

","A verbose, vitriolic vilification of a futuristic era powered by a vicious voyeuristic government vociferating to the vox populi on the verge of a victorious volte face! OK! OK! Stop with the eloquent lingo, dominated (as determined by the title) by a plethora of vs! Watch this film and I guarantee you too will be begging for v  free vocabulary!<br/><br/>So just who is the mysterious V who exerts both fear and admiration throughout the streets of a dystopian futuristic London? V is an acutely anarchistic masked male, blessed with almost superhuman powers of combat. A physically and emotionally scarred escapee of an inhumane government experiment, he lives isolated in an underground sanctuary filled with art and literature salvaged from a more liberal bygone age. His sole self-driven mission is the execution of a masked vendetta against those responsible for his disfigurement.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the fact that the main protagonist remains constantly masked is primarily where I feel the film significantly detracts from the message it aims to deliver. You cannot help but spend the whole 132 minutes wondering when the unmasking will take place. To save any disappointment for potential V 'voyeurs', it doesn't! <br/><br/>Whether or not you are swept away by the intended (unsubtle) message of the film, ie that all governments (well the 'Con'servative Government to be precise) are corrupt and hell bent on manipulating a heightening fear of terrorism through in-house biological warfare, this doctrine is seriously diluted, not only by the distracting mask element, but also by the overly lengthy V soliloquies and the sorry fact that the chief government agent, Creedy, appears to have only one string to his vocabulary bow; the word B*LLOCKS! <br/><br/>I could go on.and on and talk more about Vs brutal and far-fetched quest to dispel fear in his ally and love interest, Evey Hammond, played by Natalie Portman, but then I too am in danger (if I've not passed that point already) of sounding as monotonous as V himself; albeit minus the baritone public school vocal chords.<br/><br/>To summarize, without the over zealous monologues and with some more subtle editing, together with a final unmasking of V, this could have proved a more eloquent socio-political commentary and a greater box office success. Though definitely not an outright flop, I certainly won't be rushing to see V for Vendetta 2! Let me quickly add that there isn't going to be one by the way  the late V is ceremoniously catapulted (still masked of course!) via the disused London Underground to detonate a mammoth firework display that rips through the Houses of Parliament in a victorious revolutionary finale  ..but I'm sure you get my drift"

","Dark and Vengeful story of a terrorist. Was the terrorist good or bad. That probably depends the person. Fits perfect with our times. Expecilly here in America, even though it was based in Europ. It really hit home for us, and it also told the truth about us. Personal opinion. The government is giting too powerful here lately, and is separating our country (their was a civil war here in the movie). The people against the machine. This move was great, and released at the perfect time. Did the graphic novel justice as much as it possibly could in a couple of hours. They could have made three movies out of the book easily though. Still yet the story is told right."

","Mahatma Gandhi once said that non-violence would work in any society but the totalitarian state. V for Vendetta looks at one can ( perhaps what one must ) do in order to make a difference.<br/><br/>I must admit that I had been looking forward to this movie for a while when it had come out. I was certainly gladdened then that if anything, it exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Evey Hammond ( Natalie Portman ), who lives in a proto-fascist state reminiscent of 1984. To this end, after a encounter with some of the secret police that begins to turn ugly, she is saved by the mysterious V ( Hugo Weaving ), a revolutionary with a past that he demands atonement for. With Evey at his side V begins to slowly dispatch those who had wronged him in his mysterious past, leaving him as the outcast that he is at the present, while at the same time, beginning preparations to give the government a 5th of November to never be forgotten, in honour of Guy Fawkes.<br/><br/>This is not a movie about right wingers against left wingers, or greenies against conservatives. Rather this is a movie about what can happen to a society when fear grips it, when difference is abhorred rather than celebrated. The sequence with the movie director is perhaps one of the most interesting and touching in film this year.<br/><br/>What is also great about this movie is the way V is portrayed- he is by no means a good man- he is by all accounts a man who is out for revenge against a government who cursed him for something he cannot remember. He is no Gandhi or Mandela, but a man on his quest for vengeance and Hugo Weaving portrays this immaculately.<br/><br/>Portman is good as Evey, though her accent occasionally drops off, Stephen Fry is excellent as her boss, showing comic timing and deep regret in equal measure, and John Hurt is truly frightening as Chancellor Sutler.<br/><br/>This is an incredible movie and it deserves many accolades. As Mr Franklin once said, ""He who sacrifices liberty for security will gain neither and lose both."""
"moriol","10","1","3","9 May 2006"," Great Movie!
","This movie is awesome. I saw it in Switzerland in original version. Contrary to what I could have read on th Internet I find the movie particularly respectful of the comic book, especially on the bad side of V (when he tortures Evey for making her understand what he feels). The scenario is by itself very provocative in this period of time were terrorism is only assimilated to innocent victims' death. The whole plot shows how fear make people react in an unexpected manner and how money appetites are driving the world.<br/><br/>Actors play is simply great. Nathalie Portman is incredible as usual showing extreme emotions. Hugo Weaving is very good at acting even though the mask is a handicap. Stephen Rea is really good as a police inspector.<br/><br/>With this incredible scenario, the rest is just magnificently done. Music/image/action are as good as possible. Definitely one of the best movies from the Hollywood industry for the last few years."

I liked the prison part the most, where Natalie Portman lies on the floor most of the time, beaten and beaten by time... or V? The entire movie made me think about the current situation with the world and the events surrounding it. Of course, there is a lot of dramatization, but who doesn't like a bit of it?

","Everybody should see this film. It should be shown prior to any general election. I have never walked out of a cinema with literally everyone questioning there political motivations and opinions. This is is a powerful film and regardless of what message the viewer takes from it, or whether they agree with it, it inspires powerful political debate. Even amongst the 15-20 year old chav's sat in front of me. And that is the mark of a powerful film!!<br/><br/>The point this film makes very well is that we are quickly edging towards a situation where our governments are pushing through exceptionally dangerous laws by using fear. In the UK this would be the RIP act, the ability for the US to extradite any of our citizens without judicial review and without the sentiment being reciprocated on there side. The unquestioning obedience of our government to the will of a bunch of fear peddling neo-conservatives. This is mirrored in the US with the patriot (sic) act."

These few moments you see into the human soul, where movies can try to catch those moments. Good actors sense this, good directors lead the actors to such a moment, and it worked . . . I'm deeply impressed, really.<br/><br/>Also, my deepest respect for Hugo Weaving, playing V behind a mask. I didn't recognize Hugo (bad boy in the Matrix series, and good boy in Lord of the Rings) - here he has shown he is a good actor, an excellent actor; he gave this figure V true character, and that's hard having a mask which always smiles, because the things he says are not always to smile with, his body language was excellent to deliver and speak all what the frozen mask couldn't show: motion.<br/><br/>I read about that the author of V for Vendetta complained that the movie turned out to be a liberal movie bashing the right wing US government of GWB and also Blair the liar of the UK - right, this movie took its chance to relate to the current world situation, and I think they did it quite good.<br/><br/>Thank you for making a movie worth watching . . . it has been so rare as of late."

","When I first went to see this movie, I wasn't familiar with the ""v"" novel or anything, and I figured it was an action-packed-two hour and so- movie, that I had to watch because my boyfriend wanted to. The truth is, I never expected it to be first of all, so weird, dark and engaging and to be so character driven. You get everything from this movie. Yes, there are bangs, and they're pretty cool. There's drama, a lot. They keep the story going every minute so you won't get bored. There's a love story and a lot of character development, as you see each character grow with the choices they make. Because in all, it's a movie about choices, and how they can change the course of things.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is excellent in this movie, one of her best roles to my knowledge, V is flawless, and although the dialog could use a little less ""brittish-ism"" it does sound kinda funny when they say the colorful things they say.<br/><br/>Finally, it's also a movie that makes you wonder. Places a scenario that is very likely to happen and although the world is fictional, it's portrayed so real, that you walk out of the theater wondering if it'll come to be any time soon. It's definitely a movie to recommend."
"Newairbus","4","1","3","6 May 2006"," Y for Yawn-inspiring
","This movie is postmodern. There are many kinds of postmodern, Nirvana's Nevermind being one example of that. But this is closer to the original, confusing concept. Namely, the movie throws in a torrent of ideas, visuals, themes and music that borrow so freely from the past, present and the forecast future as to be eventually boring and implausible.<br/><br/>First of all, the main evil is a man called Sutler. The original Sutler so traumatized the postwar generations that he is popping up in this manner (very unimaginatively - Sutler has a scraggy beard, Hitler had a trim moustache). However, the film is flirting with wartime German history, trying to imagine what life would be like in a totalitarian UK with its own resistant underground forces. The film suggests that Guy Fawkes would be all right in today's world if he were fighting against a totally corrupt regime such as Sutler's. In that case he would have the People's support. The British have had their own Thatcher (1979-90) and she is the closer equivalent of Sutler and the closest we can get to the film's premise in recent memory. Consequently, the film does not bring Fawkes back to modern life. <br/><br/>And therein lies the problem. The film is rooted neither in the past, present or the sci-fi future it tries to capture. Instead, it feeds the audience with visions of a 17th century Guy Fawkes, the BBC, Dell computers, torture, the ""V"" alien invasion series, biological warfare, riots and revamped swastikas. Do these images connect? No. The central protagonists seem like far too ordinary cops in a precinct trying to nail ""V"". The general impression is that the film is an overlong episode of a British police series with surreal and grandiose twists such as the blowing up of the Old Bailey. <br/><br/>V speaks a kind of elevated English that we like in historical depictions & Ivory-Merchant stuff but here in this film there are too many people who speak like that. They are like transplants of a bygone era that have been planted on purpose in a modern soil, but it sounds faked or phoney. Changing the register to 'elevated' usually does not elevate any cultural product, if the bottom line has fallen off. In this film it has. The redeeming qualities it has are the close-ups of certain central characters (Evie), the Benny-Hillian bogus episode on TV involving Sutler and the grand detonation of the Parliament House toward the end."

I wasn't able to see any political message through the haze of BORE clouding my vision.<br/><br/>and then the next week, I saw Inside Man, exactly similar to V in that it was two hours of blabbity blah, then nothing. and then I watched The Island on DVD and the trilogy of absolute crap movies was complete. <br/><br/>what's worse is that both V and Inside Man start out good.

"scobbah","7","1","3","2 May 2006"," Hypocrisy? Well, maybe...
","So there's been quite a fuzz about this flick so of course we had to go to the cinema and see it for ourselves. I can't really say that I'm disappointed nor am I very satisfied about it. One thing is clear though - the message of the flick is good, yet it feels slightly adjusted to reach a broad audience (which I suppose many flicks are intended to). The reluctant acting and agitation feels raw in a very ""cool"" way, but in reality, which this piece is trying to draw a parallel to, it isn't really that ""cool"". Opposing the government is at times depicted as something necessary and ""right"", whilst it at times becomes a little bit too much and I can easily see if some people may sound the alarm, crying out that this flick is filled with hypocrisy.<br/><br/>So much for the message, what about the acting? Well I didn't get annoyed by anyone's performance. The scenery is at times stunning and very much fantasy like, which I find nice. All in all, I won't salute this piece as some others have. I feel it's a commercial flick that is perfectly timed with what is going on in the world right now, and it greatly benefits from the distrust of people who has grown tired of being fooled by their leaders. A good message, but it doesn't feel whole-hearted. 7/10."

","Me and my brother went to go see V for Vendetta and man was I impressed. I was pleasantly surprised when I went to V for Vendetta. I was expecting another boring comic book movie, but Vendetta had more political focus then your basic bad guy-good guy followup. This movie is all about V, a man alone in Britian trying to fight back against a fascist government where corruption has run deep. V is looked upon as a terrorist and must bring down the government, one man at a time. I think V for Vendetta is an excellent film and the first movie where Hugo weaving holds a main role. If you are just thinking this is about beating the crap out of bad guys, it is that but not really. I recommend this to someone who has an interest in politics and action."

I can't stop thinking about it, and I don't think tomorrow is going to be any different. When V pushed that domino thing (or whatever), truly marked me. The piece that's in the way, is the only thing he hadn't planned on: falling in love with Evey. That's really smart. Other scene that will stay with me, it's when Evey says 'He's my father; my mother; my brother; my friend; he's you and me, he's all of us.' Nathalie Portman's accent wasn't so good though. Hugo Weaving was perfect. Though the mask has only one expression, I could see his face every moment. Funny thing is, I don't think that if he wasn't wearing the mask, I'd feel the same way. So, a man with a mask, is more transparent than a man with a face."
"imagineer99","6","1","3","1 May 2006"," Masking Emptiness
","We've seen the image before: a white, Spartan-dressed dictator commands hold of the vacant masses. His mannerisms are stern and his message is cleardefy me or die. And, with this mental picture it's easy to segue into the world of James McTeigue's action/social commentary film, V for Vendetta.<br/><br/>Vendetta's primary success centers around its enigmatic hero. Adapted from Alan Moore's often-lauded graphic novel of the same name, Vendetta tells the tale of the mysterious Guy Fawkes-masked 'V'an elegant terrorist if there ever was one. With the air of a modern Phantom of the Opera, V dashes through the streets of a dystopia London like a British Zorro. He's a man of the people, embracing anarchy in order to overthrow an obviously corrupt futuristic regime. And, as a result, it's hard not to get caught up with what the film throws at you. Just like the down-trodden populous that joins V's noble mission, the audience romps and rouses with every explosion and with every gloriously choreographed knife throw.<br/><br/>Amidst the poetic violence is Natalie Portman's Evey Hammond. Small and weak, Evey becomes a protégé of V's honorable madness. Portman plays her character strongly, if a tad forced. Her emotion is real and compliments V's theatrics well.<br/><br/>But, like V's mask, there is something darker underneath that glittering exterior. After the explosive fireworks die down, and it becomes possible to probe through the residual smoke, things aren't quite as appealing as they once seemed. At the heart of the matter, Vendetta is attempting to comment on a world that is too scared to stand up itself. As V succinctly puts it, ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."" The words sound pretty, but the film fails to explore the ramifications of its message. We are never given the biting social satire of a film like Brazil or the hard hitting consequences of defiance presented in 1984. In turn, the result comes off tasting like stale bread.<br/><br/>But, beyond the fact that 'V' doesn't give us anything new, it has the audacity at the same time to pretend that what it's attempting to say is ""edgy"" or ""subversive."" Nothing could be further from the truth. It's a movie made for the massesthe same masses that gobble up ""Rage Against the Machine"" albums and T-shirts. The same group that screams ""Power to the People"" while simultaneously voting for American Idol. And, there lies the problem with V for Vendetta. It's a movie that is attempting to say big things, but not really saying anything at all; an attractive picture, but no meat underneath. Corrupt governments are bad? Really? You don't say...<br/><br/>This transparency is exemplified by Va character that is for all his moral speeches is nothing more than a static super hero. He slices! He dices! And, he knows how to alliteratively pronounce a lot of SAT WORDS! The void left by his static nature isn't filled by Portman's Evey, either. She seems to transform. But, really she wasn't one in need of convincing in the first place. By the time the film has ended, it is clear that V for Vendetta succeeds on a basic levelit punctures our emotions, and at the same time, is able to give us something that is visually engaging. However, once all is said is done, it is clear that a great charade has been played in front of our eyes. Portman's Evey emphatically reminds us to ""Remember, remember the fifth of November,"" but ultimately we are not told a reason why."

","I have seen this film twice already. The cast is excellent, and the story is compelling. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It is filled with hope, despair, redemption and revenge. The main character, ""V"", is wonderfully portrayed by Hugo Weaving, and Natalie Portman redeems herself from her failings in the flawed, new ""Star Wars"" trilogy. All of the elements of a fascist society -- control of the media, of the military, of everyday life, and the use of fear of the ""other"" -- are presented in an effective manner. John Hurt as the High Chancellor is wonderful as the all-powerful, paranoid, and distant leader of a dangerous and murderous political faction. The cinematography is really excellent, except for one short scene near the beginning. The director and producers did an admiral job of decorating the sets with reminders of the fascist regime. You will find much in this film that reflects life in the United States today."

"Beanamir82","10","1","3","25 April 2006"," Glorious and Exciting, Disturbing and Deep
","At first I was hesitant to rate ""V For Vendetta"" at all, given that many reviews of it said, completely sans details, ""Five Stars!"", or the ubiquitous ""Two Thumbs Up!"". But eventually I decided to rate the movie after all, because ""V For Vendetta"" is visually spectacular, excellently casted and acted (if you can avoid seeing who plays V until the end of the movie, please do so--it helps you to avoid obvious stereotypes between V and other characters the actor has portrayed), and ""actiony"" enough to satisfy those who come only for that facet of the film. However, what really makes ""V"" such a glorious cinematic experience is the fact that it goes beyond the screen and drags every current political debate into the picture.<br/><br/>In a society which is only going to get more liberal, we are shown a picture of the future, where the fascist leader (whose physical characteristics and leadership qualities show him in more than one way to be a caricature of Adolf Hitler) violently tortures and executes British gays, lesbians, minority races, and religions other than the Anglican Church, and supports wars on other countries, including America. It is the worst kind of conservative government, one which even bans beautiful works of art (including the Koran), and the people of the country are obviously miserable and disgusted. Immediately we sympathize with Evey, whose average Britishness is only surpassed by her loneliness, and we feel further intense disgust for the government which oppresses her.<br/><br/>Along comes a fellow who (a) is quaintly reminiscent of a burned Edmund Dantes, winning our sympathy, (b) is strongly supportive of the minority/gay/lesbian/religious cause, but fancies and courts our heroine nonetheless, winning our love, (c) is quirky but obviously intelligent, winning our respect, and (d) can rhyme, quote Shakespeare, and throw knives like nobody's business, winning our utter delight. V embodies everything that an audience looks for in an action hero: despite the fact that he wears a mask and wig for the entirety of the movie (I might actually have left the theatre if Evey had demasked him), he is physically fit and there is no doubt to the audience that he can kick the living daylights out of henchmen.<br/><br/>Then comes the catch: Yes, V is an incredibly attractive character to the audience (and of course, so is Evey), and yes we understand that he fights against fascism, dictatorship, racism, genocide, and Rechtsextremismus. But V is nevertheless a terrorist, and I mean for that word ""terrorist"" to carry just as much strength as it would describing a member of Al-Qaeda or the ULA. V straps a bomb to his chest and takes it into a crowded television broadcast building, then kills security guards and, ultimately, a person (one of several) whom he dresses up just like himself, in Guy Fawkes costumes--an innocent civilian. V indirectly, albeit unaffectedly, kills several people later in the movie by sending out more Guy Fawkes costumes and encouraging Britons to wear them. Undoubtedly, the Parliament building is evacuated on the Fifth of November, but its final glorious destruction is almost more disturbing in its emotionlessness. He kills, steals, destroys, lies, kidnaps, and--and this is probably the most heartbreaking, stereotypical, terroristic facet of his character--seems to think that every man, woman, or child in Britain would die for their country.<br/><br/>Upon my first viewing of the movie, I was simply awed and pleased; upon reflection and further viewings, I realized the implications of V's actions: the entire movie's message is that ""Terrorism is justified when an oppressive government is in sway."" Imagine if the Christians in pre-Constantine Roman times had begun killing innocent Roman citizens in defense of their religion, rather than peacefully warring with Christian philosophy. Furthermore, imagine if the Jews in Berlin had strapped bombs to their chests and destroyed central parts of the city, then killed Hitler, after their Jewish compatriots in Warsaw were taken to Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Treblinka. Certainly the Holocaust would have ended more quickly, but the Jewish population of Europe would then have been labelled forevermore as terrorists. Terrorism, in the United States, is considered to be an absolutely forbidden tactic of fighting, and the paradox in ""V for Vendetta"", what absolutely boggles my mind, is that terrorism is GLORIFIED, through fantastic characters, extreme visual effects, and cinematic tricks that beautify plot action.<br/><br/>Whatever your political convictions, ""V for Vendetta"" is a film every American who cares about the modern world or the future should see. Even being set primarily in London, and entirely in England, it brings forward the main points of America's politics today, beautifully linking our arguments concerning religion (it might be noted that the Church of England, in this film, is portrayed as totally corrupt and unreligious), war, terrorism, the gay/lesbian stand, and whom we should trust to run our country."

","Did anyone catch the premiere programme on ITV? To me, none of the actors interviewed seemed particularly enthusiastic about the film. Perhaps it was because they had been interviewed so many times that day or the fact the interviewer was so dull.<br/><br/>Coupled with the appalling mini-trailers shown on television - things blows up, so what? - I couldn't have been less eager to see V for Vendetta. Note: the only decent trailer is Trailer 2 on the movie's website.<br/><br/>For the most part, the movie is far too wordy, which is probably why it drags. I kept thinking ""Come on, get on with it."" In my opinion, the editing was poor and I found myself getting very irritated with it.<br/><br/>I was disappointed by Stephen Rea, who I think is a great actor, but he just sounded so bored with it all. The only actor who seemed to work was Stephen Fry.<br/><br/>As for the mask thing, it was a shame that V couldn't have been less burned so that he could have worn a partial mask because, try as he might, Hugo Weaving could not act effectively through it. To give Mr Weaving his dues, it would have been nigh on impossible for any top actor.<br/><br/>This genre is not really my sort of thing but it was, all in all, a good film. I wish I didn't have such negative feelings about it. With its predecessors, the awful Matrix Trilogy, this could have been much worse."
"royale_w_cheez44","9","1","3","19 April 2006"," An Astonishing Film
","Unfortunately, V For Vendetta was advertised to the masses as a new action science fiction film in the same vein as The Matrix. In reality, V For Vendetta, although it has a few great action scenes, is not about cool slow-mo knife fights. It's a thought provoking film that makes you question how far you would go to be free.<br/><br/>I can see though that this film may not be for everyone. If you only wanted to see it for the action scenes, you will be sorely disappointed. If you're a far-right winger and think the film's an extreme-leftist attack on Bush America and have a closed mind, then you also shouldn't see it. And if you're a die hard fan of Alan Moore's graphic novel, you might want to spare everyone else of your obnoxious nit-picks. And if you're a bit slow, you might want to see The Benchwarmers, because this film's plot is complex and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>What makes V For Vendetta work is the actors. Stephen Rea gives an under-appreciated performance as a cop tracking down V, and John Hurt is fiercely brilliant as a Big-Brother type character. Hugo Weaving does absolute wonders with his voice and body language, creating an unforgettable character. This is really Natalie Portman's movie, though. Completely making up for her stilted and wooden Star Wars performances, Portman gives an earth-shattering, emotional, and eventually hairless performance as Evey. She handles the character with true grace and maturity, and develops it flawlessly. The power she channels through Evey really make this film stick to you.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is just... oh my God. This film must have one of (if not only second to LOTR) the best final scenes from the past decade. I can't spoil it for you, because words cannot describe it. You have to see it for yourself. All I can say is that it is really EPIC and SWEEPING. It wraps the film up flawlessly.<br/><br/>In a wasteland that is called ""FIRST QUARTER FILMS OF THE YEAR"", V For Vendetta emerges as an incredible film in a time of utter garbage. Although it might be beat at the box-office like disposable trash like ""Failure to Launch"" and ""Ice Age 2"", I believe it will stand out as one of the greatest films of the year. Remember, remember...."
"primate45","6","1","3","19 April 2006"," A good attempt by a major film to be good. Not quite.
","An obvious satire of modern times. It made parallels to the modern US government and the fight against terrorists, WMDs, and, some might even say, Islam itself. It portrays a futuristic (but not too far in the future) Britain, which has apparently conquered the (former) US, and rules the people with an Orwellian iron fist. The leadership believes it rules by the divine right (familiar anyone?) and hates homosexuals. Apparently it's up to a masked man (named simply ""V"") to set it right through acts of terror. <br/><br/>I found it quite difficult to accept V's character development, since all he was an expressionless mask. However I think that was well done, considering the protagonist of the story. I also thought Natalie Portman did a good job... until she transformed into a fearless ideologue who intrepidly roamed the streets of London, even though she was one of the most wanted women in the ""empire"". In fact, the movie started losing steam after that part. The plot became more convoluted, and it didn't help that they all spoke with thick (possibly fake) British accents. <br/><br/>There was also some unneeded gore. In the beginning of the movie, V managed to beat up three armed men without spilling a drop of blood. However, by the end of the film, he felt the need to stab people in the heads, and sever major arteries, as fake blood squirted by the bucket-full. The film also brought up the importance of having ideals and beliefs, and sticking to them (V said that he was an idea, and ideas can't be killed). It was a good effort at adding more meaning to the film. Another thing that was repeated many times in the film was that there were no coincidences. To this point, I still don't know what they were trying to say with that, other than remarking on the existence of fate (which seems a bit incompatible with a film that advocates taking the law into one's own hands when a government becomes oppressive). <br/><br/>The movie made some very interesting parallels between this oppressive government, and the modern era, saying what might happen. However it didn't give much of any solution to the dilemma. As far as I can tell, the film suggests that we have Congress blown up, while the entire population of DC looks on in awe and a bit of glee (it was London, and Parliament in the film, which I found a bit disconcerting to see the ancient British Parliament building, along with Big Ben, go up in fireworks, literally). All in all, it brought up some good parallels, and satire. It was a worthy effort at a good, meaningful film, especially while trying to maintain blockbuster status, but in the end it just didn't come through. And remember, if it doesn't make you think, it's not worth your time. -Michael"

All in all, an amazing film. I shall buy it on DVD at the earliest possible moment. This has been my favourite film of 2006 so far (and probably since mid-05). Go see this film and I guarantee you will love it."

Portman was hot in this movie, at least until she got her hair chopped off. but the story line was excellent, the acting, INCREDIBLE. I kinda wanted to see V's face though in the movie...<br/><br/>Because his has were burn so, and i just wanted to see what he looked like under the mask. Still it was cool not knowing what he looked like.<br/><br/>I have another question, why do we have to write 10 lines worth of stuff?<br/><br/>I can't even think of anything else to say about the movie without ruining it, and thats not what I'm about. You want to know what happens in the movie? Go see it, or ask someone else who gets off in ruining the details of an amazing movie. I still wouldn't tell you about the movie even if it was the most horrific film, most disgraceful/distasteful thing I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The critics who see these movies and enter their opinions in the newspapers and online don't know anything about a good movie. What some people like, others don't, and if you give it a bad review because you didn't like it... well then you shouldn't be seeing any of these movies in the first place.<br/><br/>There, do I have enough lines now to get what I want to post on here?"
"mario_boranga","6","1","3","17 April 2006"," Better if you read the comic book AFTER this
","This movie isn't bad at all. Good screen writing, good acting, overall a good action movie. The problem is the comparison with the comic book: the story is similar, the ideas are entirely different. So when you watch the movie I suggest you to completely forget about the masterpiece from Alan Moore. I definitely can understand the reasons why Alan Moore didn't want his name in the head titles of the movie. The comic book is a complex study about anarchy and leaves a lot of unsolved questions in the mind of the reader, the movie occasionally occasionally reveals the political ideas of the screenwriters and nothing more, also lacking the complex ending of the graphic novel here replaced with a kind of happy ending. Anyway I must admit I would have rated it 7 if I hadn't read the comic."
"Torgo_Approves","7","1","3","17 April 2006"," A stylish, engaging, dramatic political thriller with smashing action and killer performances.
","The only major flaw with V for Vendetta is the rather slow, lackluster beginning, but as soon as the movie really kicks off, you will be in for the ride of the year. James McTeigue, previously only the assistant to the Wachowski brothers, has made his debut here with this amazing thriller which has to be seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving delivers the performance of his life as the mysterious V. Having to work behind a mask, his job is a tough one and I'm happy to say he pulls it off magnificently. Although we never see V, we feel for him, we care for him and we're impressed by his charisma. If you thought that the only thing Hugo was good for was playing Agent Smith, you've just been proved wrong.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman proves that the only reason she was so bad in the Star Wars prequels was because of inept directing. In ""V"", she is amazing, showcasing a wide range of emotions, fear, sorrow, pain and relief in such a believable way her character Evey feels real and true, which makes her torture even more painful. The actress from ""Léon"" whom I knew and loved, has returned.<br/><br/>John Hurt delivers a wonderful scenery-chewing performance as Adam Sutler, the leader of England. The plot, concerning a society where the leaders control their people through fear, voicing your opinion is a crime, and being different could mean your death, is chilling as well as pressing, and should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who blindly trusts his or her government. Like The Matrix made you rethink your entire existence, ""V"" makes you question just how much power the government should be allowed in its quest to fight everything we fear.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta builds up carefully and ends with a fantastic action scene, and a genuinely heartfelt scene between our anti-heroes. It is not often that an action film contains important political topics, while telling a great story, showcasing amazing action, AND making us care about the characters. Absolutely amazing, I recommend you watch it right now.(r#15)"
"Mister-V","10","1","3","16 April 2006"," Absolutely Spectacular! Must See!
","Two thumbs way up! The Wachowski brothers did it again. I never read the comics, and I was IMPRESSED, and entertained. This movie is a must see for action movie fans, and also people who like thought provoking movies. To my surprise, a good one I must say, the movie had a lot of depth to it. Interesting treatment of some very very relevant socio-political issues; something that you would not normally expect from a movie based on comics. I loved the execution of the action sequences, of course, with the Wachowski brothers trademark depiction of detail, which raises the scenes to a level of their own. But then again, it seems that you shouldn't expect less when you got the Wachowski brothers and Joel Silver (producer: The Matrix) as producers on this one. James McTeigue, the main man, the director, was an assistant director on all 3 Matrix movies, as well as Star Wars Episode II. This is probably his debut as a main director, and I'm sure there is a lot of good things ahead of him, after his superb execution on this one. To sum it up, top notch plot, action, and a whole lot of depth to this movie, all executed perfectly. BRILLIANT!"
"Yahya_Adada","9","1","3","16 April 2006"," Fantastic and entertaining MOVIE
","If we are debating political point of views and morals it is something else and many of us probably would have different perspectives about this movie or any others. But if we are talking Art and movie making, this is a swell of a movie. I would consider it a mix of Sin City and the Matrix without the distraction of the over-done special effects and digital techniques. The performance of all actors was ""comme il faut"". Natalie Portman's emotional takes were surprising, Mr Weaving was a performing poet as if he was in one of Shakespeare plays. All the other casts were so convincing, specially Stephen Rea who played the duality of loyalty and doubt. Briefly you get out of the theater feeling you have really been to the MOVIE."

"punkethos","6","1","3","16 April 2006"," Not too bad, but not great.
","One of the problems that I had with this movie is that I went into the theater with high expectations. It's really tough for action movies to live up to their hype these days, when stunning effects are the norm. <br/><br/>In my school of thought, there are two ways to make a killer action movie: if the director has a great script, then they must never sacrifice it to deliver on the action. If the director doesn't have a great script, then they should go all-out to give the viewer non-stop action. This movie had a mediocre script and wasn't paced very well, so it didn't deliver on either of those two formulas. As with many comic-book (graphic novel) adaptations, the original material didn't translate easily into a screenplay. The end result was that the time between action sequences left much to be desired, which produced many awkward lulls. If the script had been a little tighter, no problem. <br/><br/>In V, the directors took too much time away from the action to bash the viewer over the head with the underlying message of the film. That message is: nations who surrender the freedom to dissent are but a few steps away from totalitarianism. Nice message, but give us a little credit. We can catch on to the similarities between the directors' dystopia and the current state of things without all the patronizing news montages thrown in to make sure we get it. <br/><br/>That said, I didn't leave the movie frustrated that I had just wasted $9, which is how I feel many times after watching big-budget action films. This movie was a great way to spend a Friday night, but it's not a film that will linger in my memory years from now as a great flick."
"GradysGhost","9","1","3","15 April 2006"," Amazing, relevant film...
","I saw V for Vendetta under the advice of a friend. I don't watch television - ever - and the only two downfalls to that are that I miss South Park and I miss movie trailers. The movie catches you straight from the get-go. The plot is complex enough to make you think about things and to allow for plot twists, but it never gets convoluted. In all, you end up understanding the state of the nation, why V is angry, and then you get to see him enact his vengeance. It's straightforward, exciting, and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but watch the movie and ponder the social and political messages presented by it. That's one of the reasons you'll be watching this movie several times over - the way this movie seems completely relevant. Another reason you'll keep coming back for more is the witty, intelligent dialogue. The action scenes are freaking cool, too. There's a scene near the end - I won't spoil the movie - where V takes out several armed men using knives and fists that will make you whimper, then scream to the projectionist to start the reel over so you can watch it again.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't feel was completely adequate here was the cinematography. It really was good most of the time, but there were several shots that should have lasted a little longer or could have focused on better things. There seemed to be an awful lot of character reaction shots, and the shots that make you say, ""Cool!"" didn't last long enough.<br/><br/>The negative is easily overlooked in this action movie that is more than an action movie. It's not a flick - it's a film."
"shane-lambert","9","1","3","15 April 2006"," Not a mistake
","When the people at the end of the film take their masks off as Parliament is being blown up we see one or two characters (the little that was shot for sure, and I think we see the woman that was a lesbian and who allegedly left the note in the jail cell) that have already been killed and therefore they should obviously not be portrayed as alive at that point in the story line. Numerous people have voiced displeasure with seeing them (ie. see the goofs section for this film) because of the logical absurdity.<br/><br/>It can be viewed as a mistake in terms of film realism I guess but it is not a mistake when you try to understand the film's message. The director is simply taking an artistic freedom unconstrained by logical realism and is paying homage to people who have died trying to fight the state by suggesting that even they (ie. those who died resisting state totalitarianism) should be recognized when the fight is victorious.<br/><br/>This film, as artwork, was highly derivative. The representation of the government, in my view, appeared to be strongly influenced by totalitarian critics, Aldous Huxley and George Orwell (Brave New World and nineteen-eighty four, respectively)."
"taeblewalker","10","1","3","15 April 2006"," ""For there were no eyes""
","The botanist lady said that V looked at her (after the fire), ""Not with eyes, for there were no eyes..."" Does this mean V is blind? Does he have Daredevil-like senses?<br/><br/>The character explains in her journal that he developed new powers of kinesthetic ability, etc. Yet he seems to read books and watch movies just fine. He also seems to see himself in the mirror just fine when he puts his mask on.<br/><br/>So, what gives?<br/><br/>Overall, I thought the movie was bloody brilliant.<br/><br/>That's all I really wanted to say, although there is the 10 lines of bloody text rule. Not to be an anarchist, but I feel I have made my point. In any case, the torture sequence and its revelation was chilling, and probably the greatest barrier to accepting V as a virtuous person."
"aaronac","9","1","3","12 April 2006"," Trivia fact
","I loved the movie, and it has moved into my top 10 favorites, including, coincidentally, the 2002 version of The Count of Monte Cristo. By the way, the version that's featured in V is the 1934 version. It is not out on DVD, and it's nigh-impossible to find on VHS. V is like an opera...the characters are all very thematic, including the ""grounded"" characters. // I feel (and this is likely obvious) that the directors wanted to focus on the dangers of the conservative movements in both the U.S. and the U.K., and are pointing out some potential problems with a continued war in the middle east. I feel that there is just as much danger in liberal government as there is in conservative government, as governmental power is dangerous. It bothers me that they had to pick a side in this argument, instead of just going with the 'absolute power corrupts absolutely' approach. In short, this is still a fine movie."
"justin-534","10","1","3","12 April 2006"," Don't be thrown by any kind of preconceptions; this movie is excellent.
","I went into this movie having no idea what I was seeing. I walked out awed by one of the most intelligent and entertaining movies I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>It's the kind of movie that can be enjoyed on two levels. It is sure to be ripped to hell by Cinema Studies students the world over for the next decade, and rightly so. The film is riddled with symbolism, subtexts and social critiques to the point that I mentally started composing my next essay before the movie even finished.<br/><br/>However, the movie can simply be enjoyed by your everyday cinema goer, as a witty, action packed couple of hours of entertainment with a kick-ass hero, a reasonably hot 'Bond girl' and a richly detailed version of a future that is certainly not that far away from the truth (even if it is massively Orwell-esquire and will smack of 1984 to anyone who has read it).<br/><br/>See this movie. I think you'd be hard pressed to not enjoy the fine acting performances, gripping narrative and brilliant production values.<br/><br/>A perfect 10 from me, best movie I've seen since Sin City."
"onghongying","Null","1","3","11 April 2006"," This is the stuff of revolution!
","I have watched this compelling movie twice. I wonder if the Americans will understand the deeply politicized dialogue, good-ol' European anarchism and healthy skepticism about the longevity of freedom (not long, it seems - echoes of 1984 ring through the movie).<br/><br/>I love the actor-turned-anarchist-revolutionary concept. How charming to have a masked avenger with perfect diction and free-flowing Shakespearian verses blow up half of London to classical music. Absolutely brilliant!! This film is deeply ideological and unapologetic about it -- ""ideas are bulletproof"", as V said. They can kill us, but the political ideas will continue to challenge those in power. It spoke to me and I cried intermittently during the movie -- not from sadness but from grateful disbelief that in this era of supreme apathy, we can have a film which embraces political ideologies so proudly. This is a timely reminder that People Power is the foundation of Democracy, which gives us the best chance to achieve some degree of justice in society. This film reminds of the power that politicians have convinced you that you do not have. It reminds you that resistance, revolution, are not anachronistic words that were buried with the death of Communism. The ability to use ideas to change politics is the responsibility of all citizens.<br/><br/>Through it all the film has a self-conscious absurdity which is rather British too. People who watch it without considering the complex ideologies at play within the film might laugh it off as violent fun. There are too many Eveys around who have conveniently forgotten what it means to resist.<br/><br/>I must find the clip of V's broadcast which was very inspiring (at least for me). This is the stuff of revolution!"

","After September 11, London bombing, the war in Irak and the Patriot Act, a movie like this is a real bomb.

When I learned it was made by the Wachowski brother, I was a little anxious. But when I saw it, I was completely astonished. This movie have all the 5 criterions that, in my opinion, a movie must have to enter my ""must have"" list. These criterions are:<br/><br/><ul><li>Good acting. Portman is awesome and John Hurt is really cool. (I don't speak about Hugo Weaving because I saw the movie in its Quebec's french-translated version, so I missed the most important part of his role, his voice)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Good story. The story is well-made, absolutely brilliant and how cunning.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Good characters. While the character of Evey is a good one, V is the man of the show. A true masterpiece of character, with a deep background and complex personality.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Good, but not omni presents, special effects. A movie like this could easily be spoiled by too much special effects. But not in this one. There is only a few special effects, but those are awesome.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Good ending. A bad ending can spoil a good movie (Cold Mountain) But in V for vendetta, the end is terrific (Sorry, no spoiler here) </li></ul><br/><br/>So, in conclusion, if you like a witty, deep and rich movie, go see V for Vendetta. If you prefer fast-paced action movie, forget V. You'll get bored."

"diamondstruck-1","10","1","3","10 April 2006"," Music to my ears! Amazing!
","Ever since I made the mistake of going to see ""The War of the Worlds"" because media critics loved it, I make sure I check the IMDb comments section to get the real reviews of a film before I waste my time going to see it. So last week when a friend and I wanted to see a movie, I checked the listings and went straight to IMDb. <br/><br/>The movie that caught my eye was 'V for Vendetta'. All I knew about it was that Natalie Portman shaved her head, which made me instantly skeptical. It didn't help that the first 5 reviews had 10/10 votes and titles like ""Spectacular"" and ""Amazing"". I often think studios send their hacks onto this site to put glowing reviews here. The only mistake they make is their reviews sound exactly like the movie trailers and newspaper ads.<br/><br/>So needless to say things were not looking good for this film. But then I kept flipping through the pages and the titles and votes were overwhelmingly the same. I didn't have time to read any of the reviews, so I still knew nothing about the film. Nevertheless, I decided to trust the votes and off we went. <br/><br/>I still almost didn't see this movie because the ticket girl accidentally gave me a pass for ""Inside Man"", and they wouldn't let me in to ""V"" without going back to get it fixed. I seriously considered not bothering, but my friend was already in. When I went back I asked the girl if it was her way of telling me I picked the wrong movie, but I'm the one that couldn't have been more wrong for even suggesting it! <br/><br/>I cannot possibly add anything more than the majority of excellent reviews already posted for this film. It was indeed ""spectacular"" and ""amazing"". So amazing in fact that I saw it three times last week -- my first screening, once with other friends and then once alone. And although I don't have a DVD ""collection"", I will be first in line when this one goes on sale. <br/><br/>As some have commented, I just can't get the film out of my head. It's beautiful to watch and extremely well written. It has great acting, a good pace, and it is intelligent. <br/><br/>I will admit that it also fits my politics. However, this is not a factor in my vote. If it were, I'd give this film 100 out of 10 to counter balance all of the Fox News followers out here that blindly gave a 1/10. <br/><br/>* POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>It is funny that some would call a movie about personal and collective freedom ""leftist"". So allow me to repay the favor in kind and say that oddly enough, the right-wing, Christian fundamentalist reviews and votes only serve to reinforce the message of this film. People should be allowed to judge for themselves rather than be lied to and fed ""spin"" that serves a manipulative and controlling agenda. <br/><br/>I also find the reviews that suggest the film is over the top and unrealistic rather optimistic. For those who believe that the world depicted in V can't happen, I suggest you watch the 1998 drama ""The Siege"". If you read the IMDb reviews from the time it came out, you'll see very similar comments that later turned into ""Oh my God! Reality was even worse!!""<br/><br/>And the notion that this film endorses or even promotes domestic terrorism is not even worth addressing. Although it was perfectly addressed in one posted comment that asks if we'd have a problem if someone had terrorized Nazi Germany or Al Qaeda? Apparently some would. So I guess if our society ever falls to these lows, the Fox News chant will be: ""Incarcérez la résitance!!!!"" <br/><br/>All that aside, the reason I was drawn back to see the movie over and over was the feeling it gave me, which lasted long after I left the theatre. I think many of us agree with V when he says that there is indeed something wrong with society. Our fear and apathy are leading us down a road humanity has sadly travelled before. And it is a very expensive toll road, indeed. All it takes is a serious crisis -- real or manufactured -- before you can find yourself taking a ride on the long black train. <br/><br/>But the film leaves us hope that no matter how bad it gets, one day an equal and opposite force will emerge to right the wrongs. Let's hope it is allowed to come in the form of an idea that is bulletproof rather than bullets that kill millions. And hopefully the music starts to play sooner rather than later. <br/><br/>Remember, Remember... <br/><br/>... now the brass... can you hear it?"

","I wish they had followed it the exact same way that the graphic novel was written. In the graphic novel Evey was found trying to whore herself for a little extra cash. In the movie, she is getting ready to go to Deitrich's house. The way V scars the voice of Fate for life is in his own special way. He takes him to the shadow gallery and dresses up as a Vaudeville clown. He then uses the Voice of Fate's dolls, and lines them up as army men. That's correct, the voice of Fate is an extreme doll collector, and will have no mercy when it comes with people touching his dolls. Anyway V ends up burning all the dolls the way he was burned when Larkhill was set on fire. This send the Voice of Fate into a complete shock/coma where all he can say is ""mama"", the way his dolls did. Another thing I wish they had shown was the way V was allowed more privileges than the others. In fact, he was the one who set Larkhill on fire to begin with. As usual he ended up using house hold items Larkhill allowed him to buy. Although, it sounds like it, I'm not bashing on this movie. It was made fabulously, and V has to be the best bad ass character ever. Who else would blow up the House's of Parliament? Exactly."

","Personally, I thought this movie was great. I have read the graphic novel and loved that as well but in some ways they are two different entities because the Wachowski Brothers (those Matrix guys) changed so much of the original story in their script. Also, one thing I didn't like about the film version was it's Biased point of view. Alan Moore's original story is left open for interpretation to the reader, I always thought so anyway.. but the film pretty much just states this is this, and that is that.. deal with it, ya know? AND the fact that the movie played out far too much like a Matrix film, it was a little befuddled and confusing for anyone who had not read the novel.. Yet it was still an entertaining and thought-provoking movie by far."

Natalie Portman acted superbly as did the man who played ""V"". I was thrilled to see such stellar actors throughout (Stephen Fry / Stephen Rea (names?). This is a gripping film and a must see.

","I must say that V for Vendetta was a movie that I had been looking forward too since I first discovered it was coming out, I spent all that time since then building up more and more hype towards the movie until it was almost inevitable that I be disappointed, surely no movie could compete with the glorified imagination that I had come up with. I was mistaken.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta was everything I could ever possibly of hoped for, Amazing. Every bit of action is filmed so well and looks so wildly awesome you just can't help smiling in the cinema. The acting is, I believe, superb, especially coming from Hugo Weaving who had to do everything from behind a mask.<br/><br/>What is most thrilling about V for Vendetta is it's ability to excite you, throughout the whole movie the tension grows stronger and stronger in the most spectacular way until its final massively exsplosive ending. I think it's that which made this movie, you leave the cinema overcome with feelings and even now I find it hard to look back and point out any of the movies faults. If V for Vendetta does however have one flaw I would have to say it's in the plot, don't get me wrong, I found the story great, exceptionally interesting and fun, but I think that the movie focus to much on V's personal Vendetta against the government and not enough of what they had done to the people. One could of course argue that we do see why the people have it so bad, but if you go to watch the movie I suggest you pay more attention to how much the director shows the audience in comparison to how much he shows the masses. The way they rebelled seems somewhat unrealistic.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone. 9/10"

","This was supposedly scheduled for a 5th of November release but they missed it by three months. 1984 meets the Matrix though despite the writers of the later the Wachowski brothers it has more in common with the former. Don't expect too much action but lots of wordy prose and at times sentences that sound like someone is reading from the V section of the dictionary. Though they have promoting their first assistant director from the Matrix Trilogy James McTeigue to direct this one.<br/><br/>It's a strong cast Hugo ""Agent Smith"" Weaving dons the Guy Fawkes mask as the anarchist with an agenda. Natalie Portman is his unlikely collaborator. They are joined by Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, John Hurt and Tim Pigott-Smith. Obviously somebody thought if they were going to set a film in London at least the supporting cast should be from that area of the world.<br/><br/>The plot has its twists, all I will say it is set in alternate universe where the government has absolute power and curfews and other controls are in place but one man the mysterious V has other ideas. I enjoyed it though it's more of a thriller than an action film."

","This was a great movie. I never saw a preview about it and never heard about it so I didn't have any preconceived notions going into the movie. What is amazing to me is how a bunch of people try to put their own slant on the movie. It's just a movie and there is a lot of substance to cause debate about how people feel about the means that V goes to in order to bring about change. I read some comments where the crack smoking Michael Moore lovers tried to tie this to Bush bashing. There are the right wing conservatives that thought the same thing. I guess people just lost the ability to enjoy a movie for what it is. It was interesting that nobody compared this movie to the potential solution for Iraq that would have resulted in the US not having to take action. Or better yet, our own revolution. The point is that this was a very well made, well acted, and intellectually stimulating movie that cause debate but should only be discussed among people that have the ability to realize that playing a song backward does not say you need to go cut up a bunch of people."

","well there is no doubt that this movie is totally political with a tough philosophy behind it this is a impact on the face of dictatorship.however the imagination of direstor and writers has created an imaginary england which is under the rule of a Conservative who has become a dictator.but in fact this is the story which is going on in so many countries in the present time despite so many people who believe this movie is an attack to republican party or European Conservatives i assume that this is a great show of what is going on in countries such as Syria,Iran,and lybia. there will be just one leader with any name(president prime minister or anything else)and any one who objects to his ruling either is a terrorist anarchist and should be executed!!!!!!!! the message of this movie to the people of the world specially those who are living in the total free lands was to show that there are such countries that all menances of people is under control even no one is allowed to talk freely in his house. but misfortunetly most of the people got the message wrongly and they resumed that this is a warn for the freedom of themselves."

","V for Vendetta is one of those must-read comics that I never got around to reading. In spite of Moore's well-known hatred of all things Hollywood, this movie does it justice.<br/><br/>On a visceral level, this film could just have been about the title: revenge. But it's more than that. V is an English-major's protagonist, spouting alliterations and quoting Shakespeare. Dressed in a Guy Fawkes mask and voiced with honeyed tones by Weaving, he's instantly likable and frightening, a madcap spirit who heralds the clarion call of change.<br/><br/>Yes, there are obvious jabs at current events.

","whatever that idiot who left the comment thought, this is not at all what Alan Moore wanted to be remembered from his comics and therefore has no idea what he or she is talking about. this film is not just about freedom of speech,or expression of the mind. it represents the freedom that people should be able to express, whether they agree with the majority or the minority.he wanted people to truly think about what was important in life and what they really felt they cared about.nobody will ever know who is truly right, therefore nobody has the right to judge the decision of anybody else.no matter what happens in the world we will never know if the decisions that are made by one are more apt than the decisions which are thought to be useless and unneeded by another. who do we feel we trust enough to make these decisions for us and why? is it the leaders of todays governments or just those that think they know what's right for us? no matter what one person wants to express, their own thoughts are the one thing true to them that can never be taken away and we should not have the right to judge what they want or what they think we need. the people of the modern world depend on a governing power to tell them what is or is not acceptable in this modern world,and this lax approach to government is what leads to the riots that we so commonly see these days in Dublin and Paris. i do not condone such events but i do understand where such freedom fighters get their inspiration. it is such a shame in this day that so few are well enough educated to truly understand what a noble cause they are fighting for. i do not even know the full extent of Alan Moore's works but i cannot bear to think of the shame that the rewrites of his comics are forced to endure. i can only hope that someday the true extent of his works are captured on film for the world to enjoy and to delight his fans beyond what they thought possible."

","I guess I felt compelled to chime in here because so many people (here) seem to think this is a great film, to the extent that they've even elevated into the top #250. I liked the film and could see how audiences might be inspired by the imagery (a man standing up for justice in a dystopian society) and stirring dialogue, but this is no ""1984"" or, IMO the more brilliant ""Brazil"". I felt that I must at least record my 2 cents here as a lone voice of dissent in the wilderness.<br/><br/>It starts out very promising, I thought. I found the character of V interesting and charming, and the initial premise captivating (if not original). I was even willing to forgive a certain number of logical and/or technical lapses that inconveniently shattered my suspension of disbelief. But in the second half of the film, we are asked to accept so many strange, unrealistic reactions, logical flaws, and physical stretches that I was truly disappointed. It became a total fantasy to me by the end, and I no longer much cared what happened to these characters.<br/><br/>(spoilers beyond this point) Sure I'll go along with some of the minor suspensions, like security in a totalitarian state is so easily bypassed around government ministers and buildings, that V with his mask on has great, non-fogging visibility in combat somehow, or that he is that deadly with knives only.<br/><br/>But some of the larger suspensions that we are asked to accept: -I guess the big one is the Evey torture sequence, which was effective in conveying terror and humiliation. The inspiration of that beautiful letter was moving. But then, to find out it was all staged by V as a way to teach a lesson/to indoctrinate was... flabbergasting! Stockholm Syndrome aside, I don't think my reaction would be to sympathize with my torturer, when there were at least alternative methods that could have been tried (like simply asking for example).<br/><br/>-After demonstrating to us how brutal and all controlling the government is, are we to believe that Evey's comedy talk show friend had no inkling that staging and broadcasting a show that so sharply parodies and mocks the government would have no real serious repercussions? A person with a house full of contraband at the very least drawing government attention to himself like that is illogical. And even if it was some suicidal final gesture, at least have the courtesy to warn your fugitive houseguest that stormtroopers might be bursting through the door at any moment! -Body armour and combat prowess aside, I could not after a while accept his continued ""bullet proofness"" and/or great luck in avoiding bullets, and then his fantastic mobility in his body armor.<br/><br/>-Let's not forget, after the totalitarian government is warned (a year in advance) of a specific target building, and all other security measures are taken to protect this target, that they would somehow overlook a railway tunnel that goes underneath the building! or if they did not forget it, then, somehow they missed the big railway car packed with explosives and fertilizer.<br/><br/>phew! I feel better now. It's not a bad film, but I don't see it as a great film. Thank goodness there is no thought police that prevents me from saying this. I just wish that they had....

I know my parents talk about demonstrating in the name of peace in the 70s etc.. but when is the last time there was a MASS global movement on account of anything?

","I'm not a fan of graphic novel movies but I liked V For Vendetta. It's been criticized for being too talky but those scenes between Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving I found the most interesting. They are actually quite philosophical and poetic. Weaving, as V, is a cross between Zorro, Shakespeare, Phantom of the Opera and Batman, a masked avenger in totalitarian England of the future. John Hurt is the equivalent of Orwell's 1984 Big Brother, always appearing on a giant TV screen. Stephen Rea is a cop who is trying to find V. Criticism aside, there is plenty of action in the film. Portman and Weaving are particularly good together and have great chemistry even with Weaving always wearing his goofy Guy Fawkes mask. The mask could have been ridiculous but somehow it isn't. I found their relationship very touching. V's underground lair has to be one of the great cinematic achievements of set design. I'd see this film again."

The targets that are attacked are easy ones, and no real risks seem to be taken.<br/><br/>However,(and perhaps this is as a reflection of our times) tame as it is, 'V for Vendetta' feels genuinely subversive. After a wobbly start, two hours zipped by and left me feeling like if I didn't talk to somebody about it right away I'd burst. There is a couple of messages in it, yes. Have we heard them before? Hell yes! But watching the film I realised that I haven't heard them in a while; which might be why it felt so original. I think people are going to love or hate this film for a very long time.

","Remember, remember, the fifth of November, the gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot. Dare I say V is better than The Matrix. At least in attitude, message and story wise it is. V's story is based in a dystopia where the Great Britain is leading super power in the world. They have a conservative government that bases it's power around religion, security where everyone is watched upon 24/7, minorities are removed from the streets and peoples rights are strictly restricted. This is what the conservative sides of the government and people are all about if things go in the worst way possible. What conservatives don't want to see is that this is where their ideas could lead to and this is something the American government is slowly moving towards. The direction is great and the actors do a good job. The movie isn't very action oriented which is just fine because it doesn't need lots of fighting to work. The final dagger fight scene is well worth seeing for action fans though. Action wise V For Vendetta doesn't offer as much as The Matrix but otherwise I prefer V For Vendetta.

","An incredible action/adventure thriller of a completely mysterious man codenamed V.<br/><br/>The story is very inspiring, and has many similarities to todays 9/11 world.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a highly cultured and poetic terrorist, codename V, fighting a terrorist state leader, Chancellor Adam Sulter, while along the way trying to allow a young woman, Evey, to see the world as he sees it.<br/><br/>Even though that Sutler in this movie is a bad guy without a doubt, all throughout the movie the question is still out whether V is truly a good guy or a bad guy. The question is raised about V because V does cross the line with killing without remorse and employing the Stockholm syndrome onto Evey. But even with him crossing the line, he is still in many ways a good guy in this movie. He never hurts the innocent. He still has integrity, even risking everything he is working towards. And he opens and reawakens the minds of the free thinkers.<br/><br/>Evey is one of 2 people in this movie that is beyond a reasonable doubt a good guy/gal. No matter what, she wants to do the right thing. From doing what she can to stop a terrorist state to preventing a murder onto a villain. Showing courage when the time arises.<br/><br/>The other good guy in this movie is Chief Inspector Finch. Even though he is part of the council of the totalitarian state, the murders and terrorism perpetrated by V allows him to see the real world in a new light. Making him a better person.<br/><br/>Though being unable to see V's real face, this adds mysteriousness to the character. And Hugo Weaving's voice and speech patterns helps with the emotion and expressiveness of V.<br/><br/>There are some areas where the drama of the movie does lag by a noticeable amount, dropping it to a 9/10, and what looks like a partial rip off of the Matrix style fighting, way to go Wachowski Brothers, dropping it even further.<br/><br/>But all in all, V for Vendetta is still definitely a movie that deserves to be watched, and even more the graphic novel it was based upon to be read.<br/><br/>Give ""V for Vedetta"" ..... 8.5 out of 10"

","""V for Vendetta"" is a political fantasy of magnanimous proportion. It definitely highlights the incredible talent of Natalie Portman. She plays Evey who is challenged by V from beginning to end. There are scenes in this movie that remind one of ""The Matrix"". There is also a scene that is very similar to the style of the fight scenes in the ""Kill Bill"" series. Although this is a fantasy, it has deeper social and political meaning. It takes place in London, and the sets are spectacular. One should, however, take particular note of Portman's talent. She dominates this movie with her deep introspective gaze, and her performance truly makes this movie a sparkling one.

I saw the trailer maybe twice and a billboard here or there, but didn't really know what it was about, though I was very intrigued. I saw it opening night with a group of my friends and I was in awe! The story was very powerful and stirred a place inside of me that I didn't know was there. Now, I'm not the sort to cry at the movies, but I do sometimes get teary-eyed, and V for Vendetta just happened to be one of those movies. It's very powerful and emotional. It kept my interest the whole way through. I never really felt that there was a dull or unnecessary moment. I thought the acting was brilliant, especially by Hugo Weaving (though Natalie's British could've been a bit better). I simply adored the relationship between V and Evey! The visuals and the editing were fantastic! As a film student myself, I hope to one day be a part of such movies in my career. I hope I have not mislead anyone with my critique, as I understand that there are people out there that didn't like it, but, as with every other movie, you can't always win. Though I definitely do recommend seeing it, just to know what it's all about. To give you a better idea of what it's like I would say it's a mix between Phantom of the Opera, Beauty and the Beast, and 1984, which in my opinion makes for a spectacular movie. I have quite a share of favorite movies and up until now, if you asked me what my favorite movie was I'd have to answer with ""give me a category..."", but I think that I can safely say that V for Vendetta is my favorite.

","*Note: There may be some mild spoilers within. Or worse. I don't know, I haven't written it at the time of this warning. If you don't like spoilers, chances are you should read one of the orgasmic reviews hailing V as a masterpiece, and carefully note that the people who wrote those reviews either a) haven't read the book, b) are staunch liberals, or c) both a) and b). Anyways.*<br/><br/>This is a Wachowski film.<br/><br/>I know that they got some other schmuck to direct it. But they wrote and produced it, and their paw prints are all over the product. I can't tell if they're geniuses for being able to so utterly manipulate a director (who probably wouldn't need much persuading, being that he was their first assistant director on at least two of the Matrix films), or just cowards.<br/><br/>But I digress. V For Vendetta has quite a bit going for it-- McTiegue is a competent director when he's not bending his style to suit that of the Wachowski brothers, and Hugo Weaving is Hugo Weaving. I don't know how much of V's physical work is Weaving's, and how much is James Purefoy's (who was cast in the role before leaving the project under shady circumstances), but Weaving's voice work just demonstrates the depth of his ability as an actor. Bravo for him, and if the rest of the film had been dreck, he still would have made it worth watching. It should also be noted that films boasting casts as large as V's are susceptible to an inconsistency in performance quality; after all, there's bound to be one bad apple in such a large crowd of people, but the cast of V is strong across the boards. Highlights include Portman in her role as Evey, Stephen Rea as the disenchanted and hardened Finch, and Stephen Fry as Deitrich, who manages to take a role that was essentially massively beefed up from the book, and make the character feel like he truly belongs. Fry's a charming performer, so this should come as no shock.<br/><br/>Also worthy of note-- the script is actually solid. The introduction with Guy Fawkes, with a breathy Portman voice-over, was unnecessary (her line about ""the man I knew"" made the film come off like a coming-of-age story), and the ending needed a lot of polishing, but in an age where comic fans get enraged over any detail you can imagine, the Wachowskis managed to create a faithful version of V that is still unique. They knew what aspects to strip-- for example, V cultivating a ""special Rose"" for the Leader, that Rose being the wife of an agent killed early in the book, and the storyline involving Helen and her bid to seize power over the government-- and what aspects to keep. Being able to discern those bits that make your source material tick is a feat worthy of praise. And for anyone afraid of the V costume looking hokey, fear not, because that get-up looks so incredible that I'm wondering if I can get my hands on a Guy Fawkes mask myself.<br/><br/>But it's not a perfect film. Like the Matrix films (even the first, which I like), V suffers from a lack of care for and attention to the parts of film-making that the average moviegoer has no awareness of-- the editing was sloppy, and the sound needed a lot of work. Fortunately, at least James McTiegue cares for substance, because most of the film *is* pretty quality, even for someone who loves the book upon which it is based (like me). But it's the lack of care for small details that ends up keeping V from being truly great; for example, if only heterosexual white Christians were spared from Norsefire's purging of England, why do a number of non- white actors appear in the film? I grant you that they exist in the film for a microsecond before the camera turns away, but they're there, and for the world of V to be truly believable, they shouldn't be. (No, this comment is not racist. If you expect me to buy your universe where only whites are allowed to exist by a fascist government, then don't put anyone who doesn't fit that description in.) Further, the music and the sound effects both overpower dialogue frequently; it's not always key dialogue, but it's dialogue, most of it, I assume, very well-spoken. Key or not, one should not drown out their actors for the sake of cool sounds, or music that informs the audience how they are supposed to react to what they've seen on screen. <br/><br/>This is basic film-making, and somehow, McTiegue and the Wachowskis manage to bungle it. Again. If the Wachowskis ever want to be remembered as being great, and if McTiegue wants a serious career beyond being their lap-dog, then they would all do well to pay more attention to these aspects of putting a movie together. For now, it appears that the brothers are content to continue doing what they do without much care for the art of their craft. If one looks over the vast amount of hyperbole and effusive praise used in the other reviews here, you will note that it appears to be working.<br/><br/>It works, but it is not, by any means, great film-making. To those who immensely enjoyed the movie, this may appear to be nitpicking, which I can only say is demonstrative of their love for, and knowledge of, film-making as a craft, and as art. If you've got the keys to a high-budget and high-concept flick like this, drive according to the rules of the road. Now, I'm confident that McTiegue can mature into a fine director if he should find himself out of the Wachowski's pocket, but I'm not holding out much hope for the two young men too concerned with the absurd notion of making things as ""cool"" as possible."

","Some people have criticised this movie because it 'only' cost $50 million. Others have criticised it because it allegedly makes a 'pinko liberal' point about what some politicians will do to stay in power. Yet more have criticised 'V for Vendetta' because the central character wears an unmoving mask for most of the film. After the 'Matrix' trilogy, a lot of film-goers expected a lot from the Wachowski brothers. Personally, I think that they have delivered.<br/><br/>I also think that the 2nd and 3rd parts of the 'Matrix' trilogy sucked. Too many special effects and not enough plot killed off 'Reloaded' and 'Revolutions' for me, so I was relieved to see very little 'Bullet time' in 'V for Vendetta'. However, the brothers' penchant for protracted exposition and purple prose flared up in a few places. The Wachowski script is a dumbed-down, Americanised version of Alan Moore's eloquent graphic novel.<br/><br/>And while we're on the subject of the script, people in the UK are a lot more creative when it comes to invective than the Wachowskis give them credit for. Aside from a couple of F's and one C, the predominant swearword in the movie is B0110cks. How ironic.<br/><br/>You're probably wondering why I've given this film 7 out of 10 by now. Well, despite the sometimes ropey dialogue and overly flashy direction, I enjoyed watching a cast of mostly UK and Irish actors appearing in a film about the UK: A UK that I hope I never live to see. The parallels with Stalin's Russia, Hitler's Germany and every other dictatorship in history were chilling and well realised. With the wrong people in power, you can create a monstrous and monolithic dictatorship anywhere.<br/><br/>The production designers deserve a mention for their work on 'V for Vendetta"". While the Nazi motifs are somewhat obvious, there are quite a few subtle visual references to the Britain of the 1940s and Russia during the Communist Era. This sort of detailed work makes V's world seem much more chilling and believable.<br/><br/>V is a very English superhero and even though Alan Moore distanced himself from the project, the story of his hero/monster is now a movie. The Wachowskis may have sliced and diced the source material, but V is still very much himself; enigmatic, courageous, cruel, caring and self-contained.<br/><br/>I think that last comment sums the film up quite well too.

His thoughts and actions were for the good of the people, his battle was for freedom. We in America are accustomed to living freely but others are not so fortunate. This film is not for the feeble-minded, but if you want to be inspired to follow your dreams of changing the world for the better then go see this film. There is a little bit of V in all of us."

","Taking a contrarian with you to a movie, especially one much anticipated, leads to daunting results, as the type invariably points out aspects you'd sooner ignore, no matter how much sense they make.<br/><br/>Look at V For Vendetta. Eagerly awaited, politically-charged, top-of-the-line dystopia and what not. However, the person this writer watched it with, less than ten minutes into the thing, proclaimed enthusiastically: ""It's a freakin' superhero-comic flick!"" That much, of course, was true, and never again will yours be able to think of V in the same ecstatic manner. Thanks a lot. <br/><br/>But deny it you can't, for V does suffer from the inconsistencies and childish, illogical attributes so commonly found in hero fiction. These do erode the street cred believability of story, context and characters, although not to the extent of ruining the assemblage as an experience. For pluses it brings to the table a more mature style than the Matrix trilogy boasted, thankfully incorporating anecdotes of real adult language and gore as befits an R rated product. Additionally, V's rather ultra-leftist demagogy succeeds in appearing relevant to our time and age, indicative of the film adaptation's relevance. <br/><br/>Instead of a fascist Britain rising from the ashes of nuclear devastation as seen in the original graphic novel, there's one tracing its origins to the war on terror and incipient paranoia. Nice touch, albeit one that'll probably annoy Fox News devotees prodigiously. Likewise, some of the characters have been altered, like party leader Adam Sutler (Adolf Hitler? Geddit?), as done by John Hurt. Overall, the setup of this oppressive United Kingdom isn't bad, but execution leaves us wanting. You just don't really get the impression that it's all that totalitarian, and ultimately fail to take these goose-steppers seriously. <br/><br/>At least the usual hordes of masked, armored terror troops make merely a token appearance versus dominating the film's visuals. Those belong firmly in our present reality, with London looking just like it does today. None of that by-now formulaic Blade Runner-esquire running down of places anywhere in sight. <br/><br/>Operating in this realm are our protagonists, headed by V (an unseen Hugo Weaving), a somewhat disturbing superhero created inadvertently by the dictatorial regime and endowed with advanced combat and survival skills. V constantly makes references to rebellious Guy Fawkes, and as you may know dons the appropriate attire, mask included. This champion seeks to dethrone Sutler's administration by way of mischievous yet lethal acts of demolition and terror. Helping him along is Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), who in this rendition works for government-controlled media outlet BTN (British Television Network) instead of on the streets as a prostitute. <br/><br/>V and Evey form a close if turbulent relationship, with the hero slowly unveiling the truth for his young companion's benefit. There's some attempt by the Wachowskis to engage in existential discourse a la Matrix, but it's nominal at best and has to do more with V's microcosm rather any larger picture. There we encounter more banal conspiracy theories having to do with how the world order as depicted came to pass. Stephen Rhea (The Crying Game) works wonderfully for the movie as police inspector Finch, determined to figure out who V is while harboring doubts as to the legitimacy of his own employers. Finch's character is by far the best, not as pompous as V or bewildered like Portman's Evey. Sadly, the police tracking V leads to a certain dreariness in the film, filling too large a chunk of proceedings. Generally, V will disappoint action purists and has little of the appeal of its Matrix predecessors. Some pyrotechnics find their way herein, and a smidgeon of knife antics also, but martial arts and gunplay aficionados needn't apply. If you can gloss over these genre shortcomings, then V's a pretty decent comment on geopolitics of the early 21st century, openly calling the US and its coalition fascistic and hateful. <br/><br/>There are also a few quips that'll disturb those affected or touched by the events of September 11, which is a good thing since extolling the virtue of freedom isn't only pivotal to V's plot, it's also the movie's most memorable facet. That last one certainly can't be said of suspending disbelief, as V readily gets away with stunts that in a society of any modern controllability would land him in prison or worse. Sure, it's possible to mix technological and economic openness with political backwardness, yet even the most post-modern of theoreticians will tell you FedEx-ing a million Guy Fawkes masks to random people without having the supposedly all-seeing secret police interdict you is quite unlikely.<br/><br/>So, we have a film with lots to say, some of which gets said eloquently. Aside from that, V puts forth a passable narrative spiced with touches of OK'ish action and character construction. But it's no classic, and suffers from an ending way too Hollywood and comic book-easy for its own good. In summation, V For Vendetta's good enough to watch and ingest, but certainly not the watershed comeback some have expected. It was also the last project cinematographer Adrian Biddle (Aliens) worked on before passing away, and pay our respects we must. The fight for new, groundbreaking sci-fi rages on.<br/><br/>Rating: * * *"

","I just got home from seeing this movie in the theater. I do have to say it was not what I expected. However, it was a very well done movie. I expected a twisted plot, and i thought there would be a lot of action. It was very fast paced, yet the story unfolded slowly throughout the length of the film. The action scenes were used sparingly, which was a bit refreshing. The story was very heavy, and it did have a dreary sort of mood. I never felt sorry for ""V"" yet the other characters in the movie struck that sensitive nerve in me. All in all, this movie showed a realistic view of what has happened before in history, and shows what can happen again. The story is believable, the characters well portrayed, and the hero fits in this story well. It's worth the money at the box office. Do not expect a lot of action, but appreciate what is there.

","Ever since I started reading about this movie I really wanted to see it. Then it got slapped with the R rating. I'm fifteen and my parents kind of have a stricter policy for R rated movies, and I figured that neither of them would want to see it. So last night I went to the theater under the guise of seeing She's the Man and instead went to V for Vendetta. I was utterly blown away. It was stylish, eloquent, funny, suspenseful, well acted, and well done. Hugo Weaving creates a mysterious vigilante in the harlequin-masked V. Natalie Portman does a good job as Evey, who wakes up from her fear upon meeting V. All in all, it was a great movie that I very much enjoyed. I will definitely be going in for a second viewing. It also holds a special place with me, as it is the first R rated movie that I've snuck in to."

I would say that socio-economic groups A, B and maybe C1 would most like this movie. I would not recommend this movie to those who like a clear good guy and a bad guy as this film does not seem to have one. I say this but the audience always knows who is the bad guy, but the apparent good guy never comes across as fully good. I would not call my self a simple chap, but this film definitely contains some ideas that gets your brain thinking.

Interogation of Evey (Natalie Portman) is forceful with cold water, and food deprivation, and the masked man plays Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture over the city's loud speaker system. Pretty neat because it is much different from modern popular Star Wars orchestral themes. The setting was pretty good, however. The story seemed to drag on and on and on and on. This movie is no Batman Begins for action, and doesn't have a romantic theme as Pride and Prejudice, plus, it isn't complex as Inside Man (which was an amazing movie). But the movie is entertaining because it was a total waste of time and money, and if there were no other movies as such, how could we judge the good movies from the bad movies.

The actors were well chosen and fit the parts perfectly. Hugo Weaving in this movie is...well, all I can say is ""wow!"" He is just that good.

","Before I begin, I would like to say that viewing the film in Imax have accenuated my movie going experience. Now with that being said this movie was a spectacular spectacle of special qualities. I have read reviews from critics taking shots at the film because of the heavy use of issues the film takes on. Some critics even go as far as saying that its topics are nothing new.<br/><br/>This is an action movie with a message. It deals with relevant topics in a non-intellectual way. At times you may feel like they are blundging you with a rock of righteousness. The thing is they are not talking about our current issues, but more of a place that mirrors our own current state of affairs.<br/><br/>Lines like ""artists tell lies to tell the truth"", may seem a bit like they are laying it on thick. The fact that this is still an action movie allows for things like this to get a free pass.<br/><br/>When we see V's lair we see rooms filled with mountains of books and old artwork. This leads me to think that this is the lifestyle that led Ted Kaczynski to become the unibomber. An unchecked mind is a dangerous one, and an intelligent mind can be even more so.<br/><br/>Give V a chance, you won't be disappointed."

It was a film that is actually relevant to what is happening in our world today and what could happen.<br/><br/>All in all a excellent film that anyone can enjoy at a number of levels.

"Jasmin4","7","1","3","23 March 2006"," Where do you start with this movie?
","I loved them using the voice of Hugo Weaving for V. It was so odd and surreal to hear ""Agent Smith"". Hugo did a good job NOT sounding like Agent Smith for most of the movie and it helped V to become it's own character so when Hugo did sound like Smith (normally when speaking in philosophical explanations of the ""why"" of it all) I realized it was on purpose. Smith became whoever he wanted to become in the Matrix and he evolved in the Trilogy to be able to take over the persona of people OUTSIDE the Matrix and into Zion. And it is almost as if Agent Smith has now evolved to exist outside of the Matrix Trilogy. Almost like he is now a consciousness that can pop up in any film. It was an eerie feeling.<br/><br/>But back to V for Vendetta. The tag lines in the movie were great and I'll remember them and the tag lines are teaching tools themselves.<br/><br/>There were more than a few things in that movie that felt 9/11-ish to me. Some of the view points of the producers I'm not sure what their points were. Well let's just say I HOPE what came across was not what they meant. I got a feeling this movie will inspire more than a few people with some warped ideas. I will hold my breath on November 5, 2006.<br/><br/>The movie did what I think it set out to do and that was to get people thinking about their relationship with their government. And I think that was the major point of the movie. I hope there is a V2 in the works."
"fred-287","Null","1","3","23 March 2006"," This can't be about George Bush, the dictator's way too articulate.....
","""V for Vendetta"" begins promisingly in a London apartment about twenty years hence with Natalie Portman apparently getting ready for a date (even though it's almost eleven pm) and barely paying attention to a guy on TV holding forth about ""the former United States"" having been doomed by sin and corruption, unlike England which apparently has morphed into fascism under the aegis of religion and anti-terrorism. Natalie goes out hoping to beat the ""yellow curfew"" (how many of us have zoomed to catch a yellow light in traffic?) but runs afoul of three ""finger men"" who seize the opportunity for a ""bit o' fun."" Right on cue appears a black-clad masked rescuer who after dispatching the finger men subjects poor ol' Natalie to the longest, most opaque speech I've heard in a movie in years (or maybe ever). The puzzled look on her face probably mirrored mine. After the stranger has exhausted every V-word in the English language (except maybe ""vampire"" and ""vivisection"") he invites her along to a mysterious rooftop ""concert."" If you accept that she takes him up on it, you'll probably take the rest of the film in stride; if not, you probably won't.<br/><br/>There's something about ""V"" that just seems a little ""off""; hard to put one's finger on it. It's not the liberal borrowing of elements from other movies, including the later scenes in ""Pink Floyd The Wall"" for the visual aura; it's not the forced marriage of humor and cruelty; it's not the gaps in plot and character; we overlook those all the time if what's on screen is working for us. I think the problem is what George Bush Sr. called ""the vision thing."" Depictions of the future, especially a tyrannical future or otherwise gone awry, need to appear to have sprung forth fully formed like Athena from the mind of Zeus. ""THX 1138,"" ""Death Race 2000,"" ""Bladerunner,"" ""Brazil,"" ""Ultraviolet"" all have this in common: everything in them contributes to the desired effect and/or message. ""V,"" though, is all over the map. Natalie's boss at the former BBC (now the ""BNT"") turns out to be a closet dissident who has a whole secret section of his house devoted to contraband like a copy of the Koran, because he knows he'd be in deep doo-doo just for having it; yet he produces a TV sketch lampooning the dictator and seems stunned when the government goons kick down his door. Well, which is it: are people living in fear of this regime, or not? Also part of my problem with ""V"" is Ms. Portman herself; she's game enough and her accent is credible, but there's something lacking in terms of screen presence; she reminds me of Gertrude Stein's famous comment about Oakland, California: ""There's no THERE there."" Her ""Evey"" never really registers as a flesh-and-blood person; her personality and even intelligence level shift according to the needs of the plot. She even disappears for a while and once she's back, one wonders what she's been doing, but all we learn is that she went to a store and didn't get recognized by a former co-worker, presumably due to her shaved head; I'll admit she's the cutest bald chick since Persis Khambatta in ""Star Trek The Motion Picture."" But there is stuff to enjoy in ""V,"" some droll lines (a TV type: ""We don't fabricate the news, that's what the government does"") and good performances, especially Steven Rea as a cop with a dollop of integrity left and John Hurt in his best role in years as the fire-breathing dictator who only talks to his subordinates on a huge screen while they sit in a dark room like game-show contestants; some striking imagery (a shot of emaciated corpses in a mass grave almost torques the whole thing into another milieu) and some timely caveats for Americans who seem to be letting 9-11-01 be used by political opportunists to disabuse them of those pesky civil rights. But here's my major quibble (and where the spoiler alert comes in): when it's revealed that the torture scenes (Natalie getting her head shaved, dunked in water, dumped on a barren cell floor) were all staged by the masked man himself as some kind of test for his putative protégé for whom he's supposedly developing all this affection, my suspension of disbelief sagged considerably. It was like the revelation in ""The Village"" that the ""pioneers"" were all modern people: ""You bastards, you let a sick kid die at the outset and then you sent a blind girl stumbling through the woods where she might fall into a hole or get hit by a car once she reached the road? Rot in hell, or at least jail."" Or in this case: ""You bastard, how did you know she wouldn't drown or die in her cell or try to kill herself or be mentally scarred for life?"" I mean even a fire-disfigured ""monster"" needs some consistency; the Phantom of the Opera didn't turn on Christine until she'd pulled his mask off ..<br/><br/>By the way, if Guy Fawkes had succeeded in blowing up the King and Parliament, probably that would've meant the end of England as an entity and then maybe no America, so maybe the Americans who've made this a box-office hit should do some pondering on the ramifications of violence. Did that trainload of fertilizer at the end remind anyone (other than myself) of the late unlamented Timothy McVeigh? If you want to ""do something,"" go check out Michael Moore's website, for instance. Don't blow stuff (or people) up; ain't good karma, methinks...."

","*** This comment may contain very slight spoilers ***<br/><br/>The Bad: Almost nothing. Some questionable character motivations, several plot points that reminded me of other movies (one of which was even used in the film, Count of Monte Cristo).<br/><br/>The Good: Almost everything! If Matrix 2 and 3 had been anything like this, the ""Brothers"" would own Hollywood. Whenever I leave a theater and feel that the world has become a surreal place, it means the movie I've just watched has absorbed me completely. When I can find parallels to a movie's themes in the real world and as a result I ponder those real world events, it means the movie has affected the way I think. Perhaps these are not the only things that make a movie good, but they are definitely two factors that are important in my coming to such a conclusion.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta fulfilled those two qualifications. While the overall ""world"" it a little flat, the details of the specific movie plot are quite rich and readily absorbed me and my wife into this fictitious future England. V's philosophy, clearly twisted by his circumstance, was thought-provoking in its righteousness. Of course, he is a static character, however entertaining.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's and Stephen Rea's dynamic characters are interesting in their development as they are changed by their dealings with V.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a movie I highly recommend."
"celestivolt","Null","1","3","23 March 2006"," proselytizing polemic
","V is likely satisfying for fans of graphic-novel or anti-hero action movies. Hugo Weaving maintains character through his physical camouflage and manages the center of gravity for the movie. If the movie had concentrated on the thematic depiction of how seeds of revolution were planted (someplace/somewhere) in the midst of a dying autocracy, it might have been a great movie. The movie fails in developing an allegory of how disastrous circumstances will develop in familiar England and America. I spent cycles sifting through the American politicians that must have been on McTeigue's hit list. It was easy to loose track of the story within the movie (was this Fahrenheit/911 redux?). The movie makes no effort to explain the ""coast-to-coast"" civil war in America and how the conflict bled into Europe. A discriminating viewer is expected to take much for granted, if the viewer is to buy into the film's story. The villainous British bureaucrats fanatical religiosity runs counter to any demographic trends in the UK. The screenplay's connection between current political situations and those in the movie just produces confusion. The viewer is distracted comparing real trends to developments in the screenplay, many of which run counter. The screenplay requires so much taken for granted based on the director's fantasy vision of the future. Regardless whether you liked his message; Michael Moore succeeded in making a focused production in Fahrenheit/911. McTeigue had a choice; develop a genuine anti-Utopian, anti-heroic saga, or make a political statement and he tried both. In order to develop both tracks within the movie, the running length should have been doubled. As it stands, I felt as if two hours of introduction were left on the cutting floor."
"DonFishies","9","1","3","21 March 2006"," An important film that will only become even more important in time
","""Remember, remember, the fifth of November; the gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.""<br/><br/>And so stands a repeated quote from V for Vendetta, the latest from the Wachowski Brothers (or is it the Wachowski Siblings now?). While it is not the brilliant cinematic masterpiece that The Matrix has become since its initial release in 1999, the film still stands on its own as a fantastic piece of cinema, and one that will age well, and will become a much more important film in the future, than it can ever desire in 2006.<br/><br/>While undoubtedly controversial for its glorification and humanization of terrorism (done well in Steven Spielberg's recent Oscar-nominee Munich as well), Vendetta has a different agenda in mind. Having the film take place in futuristic, dystopic England was a great way to set the pace for the film, and an even better one as the film goes on. It's political message aspirations of a government much like Hitler's hits home hard, as the continuing war in Iraq and manipulative media reigns on. The recurring images and talks of a devastated United States, plagued by civil war, is only the beginning of the horrific imagery throughout the film that breaks down the barrier between the medium, and the real world.<br/><br/>The performances are all excellent, even with the sad under-use of John Hurt, and the faceless Hugo Weaving (who still puts forth an astonishing performance as V). Natalie Portman continues proving her worth as an actress, and Stephen Rea puts in another fine performance in a sadly underrated career. The supporting cast, even with their tiny roles, help to make the film even stronger.<br/><br/>If there is one thing the film has to come down to for its excellence, it's in the visuals. The way the film was shot just draws you right into the world, and only continues to keep you on edge as the striking imagery continues. The stunning use of blacks in every key sequence, and minor sequences is particularly noteworthy, and when the reds flow, they really do. The devastating, horrific images of disease, war, violence and death makes the film that much more important in the shape of things, and adds so much more depth and realism to the film than one could ever expect.<br/><br/>But the film is not perfect. The Wachowskis stumble on more than a few sections of dialog, and bring the intensity of the film down to near slapstick levels. The entire early monologue with V using almost every word in the English language that starts with the letter V is just downright silly, and makes the film lesser than it much well deserves to be. All of the action sequences are very well choreographed, you cannot help but notice some of the post-Matrix feel of some of the scenes. We understand it's the same creators, but the originality and bold style of the film does not need to suffer as a result.<br/><br/>As said, maybe not now, but in the future, this film will become an important entry into the halls of the so-called ""great films"". It's political message and uncompromising view of the future is bold, intense, and beautiful all at once. It is one that will be remembered.<br/><br/>9/10."
"bobafett75","8","1","3","21 March 2006"," Amazing cinema...absolutely riveting
","Amazing cinema...<br/><br/>V For Vendetta is a great film and its presentation, despite having a first time director at the helm, did evoke the acute feelings of complacency, oppression and hopelessness. The movie obviously presented a very oppressive society that can easily be termed ""chilling"" in terms of atmosphere. The expressionist shadows suggest a dark dystopian future with high contrasts between dark and light. This lighting scheme fits perfectly in the black and white atmosphere of this futuristic parable. It's not trying to show a realistic portrait that would have had a grayer atmosphere and a slower film stock or grainy style.<br/><br/>The audience is immediately put off by the oppressive regime and that's why from the very beginning, you can relate to V even though he is masked -- the use of close ups and extreme close ups of Vs face with full frontal shots gives you an affinity for the character and his struggles. On the other hand, Evey was in a lot of profile, quarter turn positions, which suggested that she was still unaware of what was really going on yet not completely alienated from the crowd because most of us after all are just as complacent as the people in this film. And yes, many of the frames were loose, which helped evoke feelings of complacency. As the film progressed, and as Evey began to transform, you are finally able to identify with her.<br/><br/>But also in such scenes as the prison/torture scene, extreme close ups and very tight framing suggested a claustrophobic atmosphere and a very high degree of hopelessness for the character of Evey. At this point, Evey has lost everything and must be reborn. When Evey is set free, the tight frames explode as Evey finally becomes a character that is no longer a slave of the system.<br/><br/>In the book, V argued that anarchy required a destroyer and a creator. A very clear parallel is drawn between V, who chooses to harm (fire) and Evey (water), who refuses to harm and doesn't want violence.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, through the many subtle indications and not so subtle film noir voice over of Evey, we can accurately predict that Evey carries on the job as V -- which is what happens in the comic. The only difference is that in the film adaptation, this is done with more subtlety and instead of donning the cape, the audience is left to decide whether Evey does carry out the duties. This is important because just as Evey transformed into someone we can identify with, she also became the audiences proxy for the world and thus the audience is left with an open mind as to whether violence is ever appropriate. If you believe that the ends justify the means and that V had a justifiable goal, then you will probably accept that Evey becomes V.<br/><br/>Yet the most plausible interpretation of this is that since, as in the novel, anarchy requires both destruction and creation, Evey's job is going to be very different from V's. This is why the revolution in the film is essential because the story needs to show that Evey will not have to topple a government any longer but will have to rebuild a newer utopia as the new V.<br/><br/>The love story between V and Evey is a metaphor for the overall themes of the story. As in the book, Evey makes V feel the humanity he has lost in so many ways. And V represents the freedoms, ideals and beliefs that Evey slowly comes to appreciate and love. Evey initially rejects V, just as she rejected his violent means of retribution, but as the story progressed, and as Evey, now free from her societal constraints perfectly illustrated with the loss of her hair and materialism that would have kept her blind to the atrocities, Evey slowly realizes that V is right.<br/><br/>Aside from this visual analysis, Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving were absolutely riveting in their performances. Natalie was absolutely gangbusters, absolutely powerful, and absolutely perfect . Likewise, Hugo Weaving was great, and although he had a disadvantage with the mask, Hugo was able to emote with subtlety that felt kind of cool giving the fact that V is a very overt character. It was a good mix.<br/><br/>10/10"

"Kryzak","10","1","3","21 March 2006"," One of the most thoughtful and chilling graphic novel movies I've seen!
","Movies derived from comics and graphic novels have just been getting better and better with each movie that comes out! Thinking back to the horrible movies such as ""Fantastic Four"", ""Batman and Robin"", or even ""Daredevil"", I sure am glad that we have movies like ""Batman Begins"", ""Xmen"" (and ""X2""), ""Sin City"", and now ""V for Vendetta"" to balance things out! Out of all the good comic movies, the topic that ""V for Vendetta"" explores is the most profound, deep, and frightening. ""Xmen"" comes close with its topics, but ""V for Vendetta"" brings it up a notch and shows you a world where everything goes wrong and Hitler like maniacs have used fear to create a totalitarian state. The movie explores everything from fear-based politics to terrorism to propaganda to government conspiracy to vigilantes to the true meaning of patriotism to love to revenge to prejudice and racism, all in a very coherent story line and all portrayed very well.<br/><br/>This is a movie that gets everything right, so let's briefly go through each element.<br/><br/>Acting: Natalie Portman is superb in this movie, transforming from a innocent and weak victim in the beginning to a hardened and fearless rebel in the end. The changes are subtle yet powerful to behold, and only someone with her acting chops can pull it off. Even though Hugo Weaving (and the actor who played the part before whose name I don't remember), who plays ""V"", is behind the mask for the entire movie, he exudes the essence and personality of ""V"" perfectly with every head tilt, hand gesture, or body movement. People have said that the most difficult type of acting is one where you cannot use any part of your face, and Hugo did a great job with it.<br/><br/>Cinematography/Directing: The mood is dark, and England is under a totalitarian state. Each and every scene in the movie reminds us of this and the atmosphere is consistent throughout. Clips of ""fear"" based news stories are peppered throughout the movie to relay to the audience how the people in Britain lived during those times. The story is very plausible, considering what is going on with our world today (and if you watched ""Why We Fight"", it's even more frighteningly possible!), and all the humor, darkness, tragedy, frustration, hope and hopelessness is weaved expertly into the tapestry that is this movie.<br/><br/>Action: While this movie has a lot of dramatic moments, the action is elegantly captured by the fight scenes involving the character ""V"". He has super-human strength and reflexes, and the choreography takes what we saw in ""The Matrix"" up even a notch, adding beauty and artistry into the moves. I believe action fans would be quite impressed by those scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>Finally, those of you who read my reviews know that I don't give out 10's to movies that easily, but after thinking about the movie, seeing what it represents, what it stands for, and how all the technical elements of film-making is put together, I must give this movie a 10 in my book, as it is every bit as fun, exciting, powerful, and thoughtful as ""Batman Begins"" (one of my top movies of 2005), if not more. I only hope this trend continues with ""X3"", coming out this May with another powerful social message, and we shall see if any other movies in the year can top this first big movie of 2006!"

","""V for vendetta"" is a futuristic thriller that builds on the story of an Englishman who attempted to blow up the parliament in London some 400 years ago. The story is set in London, after a tyrannical dictator has gained control over the country. The plot centers around an eccentric superhero known simply as ""V"". Unlike most superheros, however, it is not perfectly clear if ""V"" is a good guy or a bad guy, or what his true intentions are. Hidden beneath a mask, he's a mystery man.<br/><br/>I don't see the similarities to the ""Matrix"", as others have suggested. I find it similar to ""Batman Begins"" in both the plot line and the general cinematography. If you liked ""Batman Begins"", this movie's definitely for you.<br/><br/>Although it gets a bit boring and drawn out (and somewhat repetitive) at times, it gets better as it goes along. What you will really love about this movie, though, is it's thought-provoking ideas. The overriding message of this film is that, over the course of history, people come and guy, but great ideas persevere, and you can't kill ideas. it also offers a lot of insight into how governments can manipulate people through fear. We also see how the positive side of human nature, such as humor and good faith can (and ultimately will) prevail over oppression. It is also notably un-Hollywood in that everything's not so clear and clean-cut and you can draw your own conclusions about things.<br/><br/>Some have suggested that this movie is a subtle jab at President Bush, especially in regards to the whole post-911 happenings. I cannot know what the filmmakers' true intentions were, but I, as a pro-Bush conservative was not offended by the movie. I agreed with basic premises that were set forth, in that conservative government gone amock can turn into a fanatical dictatorship.<br/><br/>The acting all around is superb. Natalie Portman gives a great dramatic performance, arguably her best to date. John hurt is also great as the dictatorial leader of england.<br/><br/>Overall, I found it to be an engrossing, entertaining and intelligent film. Unless you just like shallow flicks, you will appreciate this movie."
"tkachunh","10","1","3","21 March 2006"," Thought provoking and astounding
","After seeing it opening night, all i can say is...wow. I am STILL having very heated debates about many of the ""issues"" with government that were raised iv V4V. I found it to be the best combination of thought provoking material and entertainment of any movie i have ever seen. Now, let me throw out a disclaimer for the following dissection of this movie. I am a college student, and up until this movie, i really didn't know much about how politics work or really care much for them at all either. You may write this all off as an ignorant college kid who saw a movie and created his own string of completely unrelated tangents. But that is the beauty of free speech, one of the many issues brought up in the movie ;)<br/><br/>The very first thing that i found interesting was the movies portrayal of the power of ideas, and how they are ""bulletproof"". A lot of people that i have read about and talked to have come away thinking that the way the movie approached this theme was ""pro-terrorism"". I can see how easy it is to take that away from this movie, but i believe there was a much greater intention. V, was by definition a terrorist, one that engages in acts or an act of terrorism, and terrorism by definition being The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons. That is what he did to a T. In this day in age, because of 9/11 and the current situation in the middle east, terrorism is EXCLUSIVELY(By the large majority of the US population) viewed as acts of hatred upon innocent citizens, with no regard for any political agenda, which in many cases indeed is true. But hardly was that the case in V4V. V had a very precise(and IMO justified) vision of what he wanted to accomplish, and why. Innocent civilians were not targeted. The assassinations on former ""death camp"" officials, while heinous, was undoubtedly justified(again, IMO). The subsequent demolition of parliament was not just to rid the country of the Totalitarian and Nazi-esquire control, but it was a symbol to inspire others to stand up for their ideals and what they believe in. The lengths at which he went to achieve all of the above is all made possible by the magical world of movies, and the power they have to temporarily remove us from reality and bring to life imagination, which cannot be ignored when analyzing V4V.<br/><br/>Another very relevant topic that was discussed was media propaganda and control, and censorship. I was very fortunate to have read Noam Chomsky's Media Control shortly before seeing this film, and i felt like it made a world of difference when those issues were being raised, and what i could draw from it. No one really knows how much of what we see on TV or read in the newspaper is genuine, but there is without a doubt in my mind, a fair amount of fabrication, with the intent of keeping the ""bewildered herd""(US general population) from stampeding and raising doubts and questions. The Pat Tillman story is a juicy example. At first he was declared KIA, implying that he was killed while fighting in Afghanistan. He was heralded a hero(which is undoubtedly deserved) for ignoring a million dollar football contract to serve his country. He was all over the news. When reports were finally found that had apparently been covered up that he was killed by friendly fire, the ""herd"" was outraged.The message the movie was trying to send here was, as V so eloquently stated, ""The people should not fear its government. The government should fear its people,"" and in too many instances in this day in age, this is not the case. <br/><br/>I could go on forever about the different ways i thought the movie was intended to be viewed, and explore the MANY more themes that existed, but these summaries only allow for 1000 words. In the end, this was, just a movie, but it was undoubtedly a movie that's purpose was to entertain, awe, and stir up thoughts, conversations, and even debates among the people who go to see it. I was able to walk away thoroughly entertained, enlightened about many of the issues that we are facing as a nation and a world today, and thanks to V's extensive vocabulary, a more knowledgeable person ;). Whichever way you wish to interpret any of the themes explored in V4V doesn't matter. The fact that you actually WANT to means it was a successful feat in cinema. (P.S.) I'd be more than happy to discuss more with anyone who is willing. Like i said, i am just a college student with a very infantile understanding of many of the issues in this movie, but felt compelled to share my thoughts. just shoot me an email :D"

"marty-271","9","1","3","21 March 2006"," Summary of V for Vendetta
","What a fantastic film, beginning with a very brief history of, Guy Fawkes in 1605 trying to blow up the house of parliament, getting caught and then being hung. From the very beginning, the viewer can see the Nazi regime being forced upon the people of England with a curfew in place and undercover police walking the streets inputting the fear into people. This film has great action throughout with brilliant witty comment from V (Hugo Weaving). From the fight scenes to the explosion scenes this film is seat clinchingly fast paced, and deserves a title as one of the best blockbusters of the 21st century, breaking the mold by having both the hero and the villains dying. A must see for any true film fan."
"trfnnabat","10","1","3","21 March 2006"," I Loved this film
","There's something very wrong with this country when a fantastic film such as the likes of this is viewed by only myself and two other people in the cinema. Being a fan of the original Alan Moore book i was originally worried that this film would be twisted and warped beyond all recognition and in a way ""dumbed down"" to pave the way to make it more GIMMICKY. Whilst not strictly adhering to the story of the books the film alters it enough to stay true to the principles and appeal of the book and keep fans on their toes and finding new things. There are some quite stunning visual moments within the film which can beat down nay sayers who say that the studio have made just another action movie. Hugo Weaving is amazing as V. it's a remarkable performance even with the mask on. He just has a very powerful presence that is required for a role of this sort. There are some really moving moments in this film which sent chills down my spine and also some quite disturbing ones. In the opening moment with Evey and the finger-men, even though i knew what was going to happen i was dying for someone to save her. I thought this was an amazing film and definitely the best thing i've seen this year i heavily recommend it"
"jon.h.ochiai","8","1","3","21 March 2006"," V not for Vision
","Homage to 17th century British anarchist Guy Fawkes is not the most obvious role model for the protagonist in ""V for Vendetta"". This is one of the surprising choices in Andy and Larry Wachowski's screenplay ""V for Vendetta""-- their much awaited motion picture project since the Matrix trilogy. This time around they delegated directing duties to James McTeiguean unfamiliar name. Set in future, perhaps 25 years or so, England is a fascist State lead by Dictator Adam Sutler (John Hurt). Apparently the result of world war and economic collapse, Sutler rules England through a futuristic Reign of Terror. ""V"" ambitiously asks us to distinguish between nihilist, anarchist, and patriotwhich may really be a matter of point of view or locality. The Wachowski Brothers aim to make a movie about ideas and the notion that the lines between terrorism and patriotism are often blurred. However, this conceit is not entirely original. Philosopher Will Durant said of originality, ""Nothing is new except arrangement."" <br/><br/>At best ""V"" is a vengeance tale about a wronged man seeking to right a grave and personal injustice. It is an action movie of sorts that is spectacular to observe. Hugo Weaving plays the masked hero V, who like Fawkes plans on blowing up Parliament. V possesses great warrior prowess, strength, and reflexes which is explained through the narrative. V is also prone to quote Shakespeare. He is a tragic man who has suffered gravely, and has lost everything that he holds dear. He tells Evey (Natalie Portman), ""You wear the mask long enough; you forget who you were"" Weaving does an admirable job given he is masked throughout the entire movie. There is great power and sadness in his words. However, ""V for Vendetta"" falls short for its hero's compromise of his own humanity. Ultimately, V's quest for vengeance is sympathetic, but does not inspire. Redemption is lost even with Director McTeigue's grand finale.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays Evey, who works at the government controlled Broadcast Network. V rescues Evey from would-be rapists in the dangerous London streets. Evey and V have a compelling affinity. Stephen Rea plays Finch the detective assigned to track down V, who uncovers the relationship between Evey and V. Conspiracy abounds in ""V for Vendetta"". Natalie Portman is very good as Evey. We learn that Evey's parents were political activists who met their demise. Portman is convincing as a young woman discovering her own greatness and power. Portman's Evey is the crucial humanizing aspect of Weaving's V. Though as written by the Wachowski Brothers this is woefully insufficient. Andy and Larry Wachowski should be allowed to coast on their ""Matrix"" laurels. Like ""The Matrix"" sequel misfires, ""V"" sets a captivating premise-- in this case the nature of terrorism versus patriotism; however, the conclusion is unclear and not very satisfying. In the end ""V"" is more sadly tragic, than classically heroic."

Afraid to blink throughout, the film drew me in from the start, at that I knew the film was a masterpiece. Incredibly well done film. This film was flawless, it had everything a movie needed to attract an audience. Visual Effects were very well done, action where need be with no dull or lagging scenes. Romance. Inspirational, Mouth Dropper film.

"kent_galloway_88","10","1","3","20 March 2006"," So good
","This movie was,to use the best word, awesome! The action scenes were so sweet and it had very good plot. The only problem was the fast English talking which was hard to pick up, but it's easy to get the gist of it. Also, there could be more action, but overall I really liked it, even a little more than sin city. Natalie Portman is hot and a really good actress, but she wasn't very good with a shaved head, which I don't think the movie needed. V was very mysterious and very likable, kinda of quirky but kicked ass, so it made him very cool. The bad guy, the chancellor, was very hat-able. His speeches were Hitleresk and the families watching him were reminiscent of Nazi Germany, and who doesn't hate Hitler. Also the explosions were crazy, huge explosions that weren't unneeded, and easily symbolic of change."

It also makes you wonder how exactly a government could control their people in such a manor as to keep them almost locked up.<br/><br/>You know the movies that when you are done you are like, ""OMG THAT WAS The BEST MOVIE !!!1!!

It is the kind of movie that when you are done you are like, ""OMG THAT WAS The BEST MOVIE !!!1!! EVAR!!!1"" and you mean it for once in your life. And yes, you will be talking about this movie to everyone and anyone for a long time afterwords. You will be waiting oh so impatiently to see it again and to get the (hopefully) special edition DVD with an extra disc of special features so you can possibly calm the burning flame inside of you that needs more and more.<br/><br/>For the record, this is also one of those movies that you should be shot for for downloading Excuse the illegal reference of downloading). The experience in the theater is unlike anything else. The cinematography makes it so amazing to see in theaters. The music is also a big part in this movie and with the surround sound speaker systems of theaters, it makes it all that much better.<br/><br/>Basically, everyone see this movie right now.....and love every minute of it.

"axordil","8","1","3","20 March 2006"," Imperfect but still very good
","Given the sprawling nature of the source material, it's a wonder anything remotely coherent could emerge in movie length. This comes about as close as one could realistically hope. The added love story angle, limited as it is, still jars somewhat, and the ending feels more sentimental than it actually is, but the soul of the comic is still here.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes, both pulled verbatim from the graphic novel AND inserted to accommodate the streamlined plot, were of shivers-down-the-spine quality. Evey's imprisonment and transformation, V's visit to Delia, and the cross cutting of Finch's ""feeling"" all stand out in this regard."
"jdarville","9","1","3","20 March 2006"," V for Vicissitude - For using lies to tell the truth can be dangerous business
","The Devil is in the details. Who can watch this film and not be moved? It is everything that true Art should be - I believe that a good movie makes you think. And this flick will bore into your brain...<br/><br/>Truth is found in the distinctions between fact and fiction, reality and our versions of it. While I thoroughly enjoyed the movie I feel that there was a debate raging in my mind while watching it, for I am a critical (in a good sense, as in ""movie critic"") and aware (I will not be taken for a ride and hosed at the same time) movie viewer. <br/><br/>So the questions we must ask of the Wachowski brother's and their film are thus:<br/><br/>Q: 1. Who is more likely in the near future of 2020 (about the time frame for the ""present tense"" of this film) to take over the government of a western power? <br/><br/>Note: The Wachowski chose to have the Totalitarians take over Britain which can hardly be considered a very powerful power right now, yet they currently serve as an intermediary between US (in the US) and Others. While the Utopian English Empire has homage (film referencing other film and art) to the works of 1984 and (more importantly) Brave New World et al. is nice. And the Brits have a historic place in the cause of freedom (Magna Carta, Moore and the Wachowski's own twisted major reference to Fawkes, The US Revolutionary War, WW II etc.) I believe that the writers choice was meant to divert attention from the US - so that they could take some shots in a backhanded way. Hey that is their prerogative and it makes for good drama... <br/><br/>A: As we are currently functioning under the dawn of modern terrorism in this world there is a greater likelihood that Islamic extremists will take over government power in the west than any other group, no matter their ambitions. I can back this up left and right - I guarantee it. If you are going to challenge this you are blind... <br/><br/>Q: 2. What is the greater lie, White Conservative Despots using religion to subvert an entire nation or ignoring the history of both White and all ethnic groups Progressive Socialistic Absolutist tendencies to torture and manipulation?<br/><br/>A: ""Have you forgotten the hills of Verboten, where Auschwitz rests forever guests in chambers none would choose."" The National Socialists were - yup socialists... and ATHEISTIC (please don't even try to promote some sick and twisted version of Hitler the Good Anti-Semite Catholic - that is garbage and you should know better)... I could go on, but I won't. The Wachowski's confidently forget these minor ""details"" in favor of a American is bad, Christianity is bad - down with the intolerants (because they don't agree with us) type of thinking. Hey, I'm not homosexual and I wouldn't promote it - but it is vile to portray haters of homosexuality as White Males when the Islamic terrorists who adhere to the Koran are the ones doing away with ""infidels and their versions of sexuality"" in these countries. These are harsh topics to come to terms with but if the Wachowski's can bring them up then we can sure as hell talk about them. Don't tread on me and don't shut me down... If you want to behave as you want then you must allow me to behave as I choose --- and where government exists is where the two shall meet and we can agree to disagree peaceably... This, is FREEDOM FOREVER, as we will know it here on earth. <br/><br/>This film portrays the freedom fighter well. I'd say I tend toward the Anarchist rather than the Totalitarian - because ""people should not be afraid of their government, Government should be afraid of its people."" See Constitution And. 2. While much of this movie flys in the face of reality ""when you're a Buddhist..."" <br/><br/>When you're a Buddhist You have the whole world before you When you've found the one The only one to love and adore you And when you learn the sigh of it The long of it, the cry of it Life begins when EVERYONE wins And you're a Buddhist and no one cares... <br/><br/>My apologies Brown / Victor Schertzinger / Andrew Acquarulo Ackers - and Ms. Billie Holiday."

","One can't ask for more of the Moore's adaption to a movie, V4V. Director James McTeigue comes with another masterpiece after MATRIX. And Natalie Portman (along with a stellar supporting cast of Stephen Rea), comes out with another brilliant performance after CLOSER. This is a movie about REVOLUTION that might come in future years, but whatever it is, it was a revelation of the 2006 movies. This is the same time as CRASH hit the theaters last year, and I would be surprised if this film is not nominated for OSCARS'07! I won't go into the storyline, as many of comments had already posted a brief outline of the movie. But the essence of the story is: A day is near when common people are going to revolt against the government, someone somewhere is just yet to arrive to hold the torch of the Revolution. The film compares everything, starting from Hitler's attitude to modern day's HITLERs out there (almost in every continent)! It also projects the diseases conquering the world (from Avian Flue, deadly viral disease etc). It reflects the war within us, the war of power-frenzy humans against the weaker ones and against the common people. Essentially the movie relates the saga of human life in the 21st century is the same as it was in 20th century, nothing different, only more sophisticated. A must watch. It left me spellbound, hope it will cast a same effect on you too."
"badoix","9","1","3","18 March 2006"," Spectacular! *This* is the real sequel to The Matrix.
","V for Vendetta is a must-watch. It has all the elements that made 'The Matrix' more than just another action sci-fi, a more convincing and thought-provoking plot and less of the loose sentimentalism that spoiled the Matrix sequels. Drama, not action, is still the main focus of Vendetta, in typical Wachowski brothers fashion, but this time it is restrained and powerful, making for a tight and action-packed thriller.<br/><br/>*may contain spoilers* <br/><br/>Much of the credit for the plot must, I suppose, go to the original graphic novel by Alan Moore (which I haven't read). Without giving too much away, the movie is about the revolutionary (or terrorist) acts of one masked crusader, V (Hugo Weaving, unrecognizable except for the voice), against a fascist regime in future Britain. We see the plot unfold through the eyes of Evey (Natalie Portman), whose realization of the horrors of the dystopic society she lives in and her subsequent turn to activism mark the dramatic high point of the film.<br/><br/>Is Vendetta politically and socially relevant today? Unquestionably. The Wachowski brothers do well to tie the plot to the current scenario in the US (e.g. the fall of the WTC, the dominance of right-wing politics) without trying to make an overt political commentary a la Fahrenheit 911. The film remains firmly in the realm of science fiction and that is where it belongs.<br/><br/>Needless to say the action sequences are superb. Even the insipid sequels to the Matrix managed some decent action sequences (e.g. the Hollywood freeway chase from Matrix Reloaded) and Vendetta is no exception. The music supports the choreographed action sequences wonderfully well. The characteristic slow-motion knife fights are there and as good as one could hope for.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is, simply put, a revelation. In spite of Hugo Weaving's stylish turn as V, she is the heart and soul of the film. Stephen Rea is particularly good as the police chief, a conscientious servant of an immoral regime. The rest of the supporting cast does well too.<br/><br/>All said and done, Vendetta is a must-watch. 9/10."
"kiteazule","6","1","3","18 March 2006"," An ""Interesting"" Take on a Brilliant Novel
","Though an interesting movie, and surely entertaining, V for Vendetta takes execrable liberties with the story by Alan Moore (so much so that Mr. Moore preferred his name not be attached to the film). Gone is the prevailing theme of anarchy as an alternative to fascism. Gone, too, are many of the lesser truths of the movie; but then again, as they said, ""artists use lies to tell the truth."" I can forgive the usage of television instead of radio for the use of propaganda, I cannot however neglect the drastic changes that go far beyond nuance.<br/><br/>In Moore's graphic novel, no mention of Guy Fawkes is ever made. This is but one of the many things that in the movie is spelled out for the audience, but that the novel leaves as unsaid, though understood. Also, the novel does not take place in the future. (Though it should be noted that when written, the novel's time would have been the future, so this is understandable.) In the novel's beginning, Evey Hammond is trying to solicit herself upon the Fingermen, who then threaten to rape and kill her. V blows up the House of Parliament and then The Old Bailey, quite a drastic difference from the film. The graphic novel makes no mention of America, or ""America's war,"" both of which grandly offended me in this movie. That places a completely unnecessary element into the film, one that changes the viewer's concept of fascist Britain. And as for the St. Mary's Virus... I don't even know where that came from. Maybe the Wachowskis just wanted to throw another 'v' word into the mix. And as for how Finch was able to enter V's mind so ably at Larkhill, in the graphic novel, he was on LSD. No such mind-altering drugs are mentioned in the film. Which also reminds me that the theme of Britain's genocide seemed drastically down-played to me in the movie in comparison to the novel, though that may just be me. A huge discrepancy betwixt the graphic novel and the film is the manner in which V dies. I will not spoil that fact, but I shall just say that the bullet-storm V endures at the hands of Creedy is quite inaccurate. Lastly, the army of Vs, so flagrantly displayed in the the trailers, is an interesting idea  I will go so far as to say that I thought it was kind of bad ass  but entirely new to me. And as for V's final words to Evey in the movie... I nearly violently vomited.<br/><br/>That said, I knew the movie was going to be a drastically different take than the graphic novel. As such, I was not entirely shocked by these massive changes. To put it as best I can, the differences between the book and the movie are much like the differences between Christianity and Islam. Yes, there are very noteworthy departures, but both have at their core a similar message, and at the end of the day, both accomplish the same goals.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this movie, though remind those that read the graphic novel to be prepared for a completely different view."
"freaky_dave","8","1","3","18 March 2006"," A thought provoking movie that'll have people asking questions
","V for Vendetta was a well made film with quality acting. It was also thought provoking and will make you wonder about your own government.<br/><br/>V stars Hugo Weaving as a vigilante that wears a Fawkes mask and uses tactics which resemble terrorism to fight back against the totalitarian government that controls Britain. He also uses television to let the country's population understand that the government they allow to control them is wrong. He wants people to know that it was their fear which created this dictatorship government that has taken away their rights, and now he wants them to stop being afraid.<br/><br/>He is not alone however. For a young woman (Natalie Portman), whom he saves from imprisonment, becomes a sort of ally in his quest to destroy the government so that people will no longer live in fear an oppression. She doubts him at first, and it takes awhile for her to ally with him, but she finally does, and the story goes from there.<br/><br/>It's been awhile since I've seen a movie as thought provoking as this one. Mind you I haven't seen Crash or any of the other Oscar nominated films, but I digress. Let's just say that V for Vendetta will have viewers questioning authority and maybe open some eyes to what is going on around them. I'm sure many will think that this movie is a bashing of the Bush administration, but don't let that fool you. It's talking about the possibility that any government, no matter what country, can become out of control if its people allow it.<br/><br/>Besides quality acting, V moves at a good pace. I did not once get bored watching it. The director James McTeigue never allows the movie to get dull even during the more quiet scenes.<br/><br/>The Wachowski brothers, who created another future world with the extremely popular Matrix trilogy, have themselves another winner here. They really know how to get an audience thinking about the real world around them and start questioning the way things are being done. You really can't ask for more.<br/><br/>The visuals are pretty hard to comment on. They were decent enough, but sometimes things moved so fast, that it made it hard to really give an opinion about them. But I was not disappointed with what I saw.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is definitely a very good movie. It is one I would highly recommend to anybody who has ever questioned the way things are done when it comes to those governing them."
"timmythesaint-1","7","1","3","18 March 2006"," Better than i thought it was going to be.
","Having read the comic and being a fan of Alan Moore's work I went to see V for Vendetta with a biased opinion. Basically I went to see it to see how bad it was. Strangely though I found I actually enjoyed it. I would say the majority of the film mirrors the book and its imagery quite well and gets the ideas across strongly. Some of it seems a little far fetched as it obviously would be with the Wachowskis on board and the ending ruins any hope of it being fantastic. But if anything the film is enjoyable. Also key lines from the comics dialogue are missing which I would like to have seen there. But V looks fantastic in the mask and whatever anyone says does convey emotion through it. Natalie Portman seems a bit 'Mockney' in parts and I'm not sure Americans are going to get it as it seems a real English film. The music score is amazing and without it the film would have seemed a lot flatter. I still think the comic is better but I think this is the best Hollywood could have done with this story. Even Alan Moores most avid fans should go and see it just to dispel the myth it isn't as bad as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or From Hell."
"mxpxchic223","10","1","3","17 March 2006"," Although overdone at certain points, still an enjoyable, thought-provoking, and worthwhile movie
","After reading a review in Newsweek about how overdone and contrived the movie is, I was a bit wary about seeing it. However, I went to see it at the 10:10 showing Thursday night anyways, and I'm glad that I did. <br/><br/>Anyone who enjoyed the book 1984 will find something they like about this movie. Although certainly not as good as 1984, as few books or movies are, V for Vendetta offers its fair share of thoughtful criticism and commentary. Although at times the jabs at conservative ideals, the current administration, etc. are lacking in subtlety, the plot is solid, the acting is good for the majority of the movie, and the special effects are visually pleasing (although not as inventive as the matrix movies). <br/><br/>Arguably, this movie appeals to a certain audience. While many might be offended by its leftist ideology, the movie is a work of social and political commentary, and commentary means that there will always be those who hate it and those who love it. Commentary as i see it, however, is not meant to attack individuals, but rather to raise questions. If people dislike the movie because it questions the way things are or the way things will be in the future, then what does it say about society? Have we become so complacent that we have lost the will to forever question?<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the movie also has many funny moments. The humor lightens the tone of the serious topics, creating a bit of a sense of absurdism that is appropriate, I think, for the movie. Also there is humor to be found in parts that are not necessarily meant to be funny. Case in point: Natalie Portman trying to make out with V (a bit silly with the mask in the way). Because I was snickering at certain ""serious"" parts throughout the movie, my friend thought I did not enjoy the movie. In fact, I thought those parts made the movie more enjoyable. A movie is still good if you can laugh at the overdone parts, it is only when you cannot that an ""overdone"" part becomes truly overdone. <br/><br/>Most of all, what I liked about this movie were the ideas and the lines that delivered them. When V says, ""Beneath this mask there is more than flesh. There is an idea, Mr. Creedy, and ideas are bulletproof"", I immediately thought of novel Fahrenheit 451. A government can ban books, it can burn books, it can take away its people's rights, but it cannot abolish ideas. Albeit some parts were heavy-handed, V for Vendetta still gets a 9/10 from me because it remains loyal to Guy Fawke's Gunpowder Plot, teaching us the lesson that there is always room for rebellion.<br/><br/>and still i cannot get the rhyme out of my head:<br/><br/>""Remember, remember the fifth of November, gunpowder, treason and plot, I see no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot."""
"evey1985","10","1","3","17 March 2006"," Fantastic
","I just watched it and thought it was sensational. There were a few action scenes to keep people happy and i think it stayed close to the theme of the comic. If you don't shed a tear or two at the end i would be surprised. The music is brilliant and at several points i felt like jumping out of my seat and shouting some revolutionary slogan at the screen because it was so powerful in places. Especially the explosive end theme. The end did go a bit odd i think it may have been symbolic with the blink and you'll miss them faces in the crowd (look close and you'll see who i mean). But over all just fantastic. And it's a real testament to Hugo Weaving acting ability that in the bit near the start, where he has to introduce himself with a speech filled with V's, he doesn't sound stupid, no other actor could have pulled it off. He gives that mask life and at some points you almost forget he's wearing the mask because of the performance his giving. Everyone keeps complaining about Natalie Portman's accent i swear you will get so involved in the story that unless you are actively looking for reasons to dislike it you won't even notice. And Fry is as always brilliant. The only reason i did not give it 10 is because i thought it was too short."

","I saw this movie last night at the midnight showing and it was more than I expected. The movie is over two hours long but it doesn't seem that way because it goes pretty fast. Portman is amazing in this and V is a great character. My boyfriend read the book before we saw it and he said the movie was good but didn't explain as well as the book. The story was a little hard to follow only because there were a lot of flash backs. Maybe it was me because it was midnight after all and I was pretty tired! The music is perfect and the story is quite moving. The whole idea of the Boston Tea Party and the future London is represented well. The huge twist of Portman actually being in V's house instead of a real prison was mind blowing! V For Vendetta is a emotional and eye opening movie. I will more than likely go see it again soon!"
"Mike_McDuck","8","1","3","16 March 2006"," Wow!
","I just got back from the sold-out 10:00 pm sneak preview at the Imax theater in Natick MA.<br/><br/>First off, let me say that I started reading this story in issue 1 of Warrior, back in 1981. I had to follow it episodically for the next two years or so, then wait years and years for the ending to get published after Warrior went out of business halfway through. So I have been waiting a long time for this movie.<br/><br/>I found it very true to, at least, the spirit of the graphic novel. Many scenes and sequences were straight out of the GN. Natalie Portman turned in a great performance, and Hugo Weaving managed to make a frozen mask convey a range of emotion in a way that David Prowse as Darth Vader never did. Yes, the story was condensed and modified, but it was still the same basic story, most of the characters advanced the same ways, and it made the same points about society and individuals.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most telling thing was that the entire audience was almost dead silent through the entire film. No cheering, no whistling, not even much laughing at the few funny spots. They were just so absorbed, spellbound even. At least that is how I interpreted it.<br/><br/>This is a movie that will not be to everyone's taste, but if you want a movies with good acting and directing, plus action and characterization, I think you would enjoy it. That's as much as I want to say without having any spoilers. :-)"
"larsonlarson","8","1","3","16 March 2006"," Not orthodox to the graphic novel, but surprisingly bold nonetheless
","First of all, I have to say how excited I was that V for Vendetta came out on time here in the Kong. Usually, we get movies two months to one year later than the rest of the world. So not only did I get to see it on time, but thanks to time zones and the international date line, I actually got see it *before* most of the rest of the world.<br/><br/>If you're a purist to the graphic novel, like me, you will inevitably be disappointed by some changes to the script. But overall, considering some of the horrible scenarios flashing through my mind before seeing the movie, I was generally relieved to see that the spirit of Alan Moore's story was left intact. As you may have read, the story has been updated from Thatcher's cold war to be more relevant to Bush's war on terror. The character of Evey has been changed to be far less naive and childish; Natalie Portman's portrayal was probably closer to something modern day people can relate to, especially now that people are encouraged to turn in their neighbors if they are considered suspicious.<br/><br/>Some scenes, such as V's confrontation with Dr. Deliah, and Evey's imprisonment (including the letter written on toilet paper), are faithful and extremely powerful. But many other events are taken out of their original chronology and altered, and this may bother you if you are really faithful to the graphic novel.<br/><br/>I'm kind of crap at this right now, especially after a few celebratory beers, so I'll end with the two reassurances most important to me (very slight spoilers, but not if you've read the graphic novel): Parliament DOES get blown up (but again, chronology is altered), and V's mask is NOT removed to reveal his face in the movie. In worrying about the ""hollywoodization"" of V for Vendetta (not to mention big-name Hugo Weaving as V), these were the foremost concerns in my mind, but having braced myself for the wost, I am pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>For a mainstream film, this is pretty edgy. If you love the graphic novel, you may be kind of disappointed-- but take heart, considering the other Alan Moore adaptations to hit the big screen, this is a huge improvement. If you haven't read the graphic novel, I sincerely hope that the movie will pique your interest and that you pick up a copy."

","having read the graphic novel, i expected a lot from this film. i was slightly disappointed, but as with every print-to-screen adaptation, it comes with the territory.<br/><br/>virtually every subplot has been eliminated to focus on the three main characters. v the revolutionary, every the unwitting apprentice, and finch the detective.<br/><br/>this could have been better, but we can say that about every movie that's ever been made if we want to nit-pick.<br/><br/>overall, it follows the primary story as laid out in the original comic; one man against the totalitarian world.<br/><br/>miss portman's performance was great, the FX were great, and the ending was a bit more upbeat than the book. heck, it was damn near inspirational.timely also, considering our current state of the world.<br/><br/>i expect most people will enjoy this more if they hadn't read the book first. at least that's how it seemed at the advance screening i went to. most of the crowd applauded and cheered at the explosive finale. the few people i talked to hadn't read the novel.<br/><br/>v comes off as more of a ""superhero"" than in the comic, which in itself isn't a bad thing. it's just too bad the ""symbol being greater than any one man"" moral already was used in BATMAN BEGINS.<br/><br/>expect negative reviews from comic fans who hold this title in high regards. just as you should expect better reviews from movie fans that don't read comics.<br/><br/>not the best adaption ever, but better than FROM HELL or LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMAN, the other two alan moore titles already filmed.<br/><br/>not as good as the book, but an above average film nonetheless."
"sillyputty235","10","1","3","16 March 2006"," Absolutely amazing!!!
","When I walked into the theater, I expected this movie to be a good sci fi flick. Good seriously undermines fantastic, which seriously undermines my feelings about this film. I have a firm belief that this is and most likely will be one of the best films of 2006. The acting was brilliant, Hugo Weaving, Natalie Portman and Stephen Rea were all fantastic in their roles, not one of their characters was worn out and their personalities stood firm throughout the film. The special effects were good, though they are not the trademark of the film, unlike the recent Star Wars movies. The main theme of the story is a regularly exercised one. There are many stories like it, such as Fahrenheit 451 and 1984, but Vendetta captured the audience's attention, and could relate the mysterious character V to the audience. Although the character exhibited heroic like traits, he had certain imperfections that showed him to be a man. Overall, this film was fantastic and I hope that it can be given a place on the Top 250 list of all time."

","I applaud this movie. It's about time that an action movie makes you think about the path this world is on. Never have i seen a movie depict such hard and politically soaked material. It was like watching the holocaust documentaries showing the death camps. It was like watching Hitler address the German people. It was like watching the way America will be if we keep on letting this Patriot Act live. It was an amazing, intelligent movie. The greatest part was when she is being held by what everyone must think is the police but really it is V trying to remove fear from her. I'll end with two quotes i made up. ""The fear of the noose is stronger then the noose itself"" ""for those who think liberals are taking over this country, i find it absurd, for the very definition of a liberal means that i'm still in the minority"""
"Movie_Man_65","10","1","3","16 March 2006"," Not the book, but still very good
","It must be said that for those who are expecting the book, do not. The Wachowski Brothers have cleverly made several new takes on this very popular story. Basically, V For Vendetta was as good as anyone could have possibly made it, and that is saying something.<br/><br/>Granted that the movie does not follow the book line for line, and at times it does things that actually go against what was originally written in Alan Moores work. Still most of the main points that happen in the graphic novel happen in the movie, so die hard fans of the novel, like myself, will not be too disappointed. In fact, some might actually enjoy this new take on the character of V.<br/><br/>With amazing performances by both Hugo Weaving as the swashbuckling V and Natalie Portman, leaving her pretty girl routine behind, as the young Evee Hammond, V for Vendetta will have you shouting out ""Remember Remember the 5th of November"" as you walk out of the theater."
"shade_of_green","8","1","3","16 March 2006"," a semi-objective view
","First off, i'm a long time Alan Moore fan, i first read watchmen when i was 11 and have fallen in love with all of his work ever since. As a film, V for Vendetta is not a disaster. The acting is very good from all the major players, including Natalie Portman, whose presence, I thought, would have ruined the film. Weaving is perfectly cast, the visuals are stunning, and the soundtrack is superb. However, as an adaptation of the graphic novel, this movie fails stupendously. Gone is the oppression of the totalitarian government, the seedy characters fighting each other for domination, the intricate character-driven subplots; the gritty London the characters inhabit. It is replaced with a candy-coated version of the world Moore created. Although a minor detail, i was very distressed to see that Evey Hammond was not a prostitute, as it showed the state of the country and the hardships the citizens had to endure to make ends meet. So as a stand-alone film: excellent. As an adaptation of one of Moore's greatest creations: mediocre. I suggest seeing it but if you've read the comics you will probably feel at least a bit let down."

","The most clear giveaway of those comparisons was the room with the Swastika in the middle of the words, ""The coalition of the willing ... for power"".<br/><br/>The idea of the movie was the America's war on terror has caused so much fear in the public and as a result has made their leaders very powerful...powerful enough to the point where it has become a George Orwell 1984 like society. America has descended into civil war and Britain is under complete control of ultra conservatives who have banned homosexuality, the Koran, and anything else they see a threat to Bush/Cheney ideology. These governments who are part of this war on terror-namely the U.S. and the U.K. through Iraq's invasion-are resorting to Nazi-like cruelty where part of the population is deliberately killed and shortly afterwords a new vaccine developed for the purpose of reelection and profit; a direct tie between the Bush/Cheney hunger for oil and desire to scare the public with terror warnings and public support resorting to the government for safety. V was undertaking a violent revolution because, I suppose, he felt there was no other way to topple the government and restore power to the people.<br/><br/>There was of course more to the movie, but those are initial thoughts after just walking out of the theater...."

I will be buying this on DVD and maybe even going to see it again.<br/><br/>One thing is for sure... if the Wachowski bros can keep pumping out scripts like this I will be in line every time.

","A few days ago, a city inspector or norm enforcer functionary gave me $ 100 fine for being parked in MY OWN HOUSE. Reason, just because two of my wheels were on the lawn and that damage the beauty of my neighborhood. When I tried to talk to his supervisor, I questioned and humiliated like a common criminal in the City Hall office. The conclusion of the discussion was ""WE WONT BE TALKING ANY MORE WITH YOU, PLEASE LEAVE"".<br/><br/>I remember that before September 11th five years ago, USA was the FREEDOM country. But, after the tragic events, government officials (police and civil servants) had been, invoking our security, abusing of their power and mistreated citizens and all of us had been closing our mouths and humbled.<br/><br/>Now, five years after and for the first time a movie dare to talk about the abuse on the people and it does in a really very fearless way. ""V FOR VENDETTA"" is being sold as a comic which is really it is; however not the type of movie is you will be seeing a second or third installment (well everything is possible in Hollywood).<br/><br/>Completed a few years ago, the movie was not released until now (commercial reasons or fear?). Now that the American government is being questioned about everything that happened in recent years this movie comes with another theory about everything.<br/><br/>The story does not happens in the USA (neither was the comic), but the events depicted are easily related. There was a huge massacre attributed to the Muslim terrorist and a Chancellor using that to become a ""DEMOCRATIC DICTATOR"". The movie clearly suggests government intervention on terrorism blamed events.<br/><br/>Other current events are shown. The use of ""FOR YOUR SAFETY"" propaganda and the abuse of lies in the media in order to keep the people frightened and accept every possible abuse. Did I mention corruption on the highest government levels, tortures and people kidnapping? Due to its strong political subject, ""V FOR VENDETTA"" is a must see movie which does not means is really a great movie. The rhythm is uneven; there is far more talk than action (probably because the great Hugo Weaving never take out the mask) and many implausibilities (like Portman's torture). The acting is very good Stephen Rea and Natalie Portman are able to carry the movie most of the time. John Hurt is a little too much as the hideous Chancellor."

I just don't believe that 1 piece of chest protector could've stopped all those bullets coming from less than 10 feet away. They must've unloaded over 500 rounds on him from point blank and none of those guys even attempted to shoot him on the leg or something cuz apparently his facemask is also bullet proof.

","V for vendetta is the adapted version of the graphics novel written by Alan Moore. Few days back I read an article that the justice was not done to the movie. The graphic novel was much more impressive than the movie itself. Truthfully, I have not read any of these graphic novels, but the movie is just phenomenal! The movie is about a character called ""V"" who tries to bring a revolution in England by blowing up the House of Parliament, as Guy Fawkes attempted on November 5^th 1605. The movie is based in near future when the USA is no longer a super power and a civil war is going on, which has destroyed its presence in the world. Since then, England is trying to maintain its distance from the United states of America and trying to implement new policies in its political system, which has lead its citizens to dictatorship by a man called Adam Sutler.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully written, specially its dialogues (thank god for the invention of sub-titles). Hugo Weaving has done exceptionally well as the character ""V"". Even though he wears a mask throughout the movie, his dialog delivery was just excellent. His older work can also be seen in the Matrix Trilogy as Agent Smith. Natalie Portman as Evey has also done a good job.<br/><br/>I don't know what I am missing by just seeing the movie and not reading the comic books, but the movie has left an impact on me and I couldn't ask for more."

The political message is seriously up to date ... perhaps more now even than 4 years ago, what with the purveyors of economic doom alive and well. I don't live in the UK though I am a Brit. and as someone remarked in their review, it was scary to see it set in England and very 'British', which also makes it funny, though not silly. The comments that V makes that the descent into fascism is everyone's fault for abandoning their common sense, is just riveting. <br/><br/>I think the Title V for Vendetta put me off watching it more than anything else, writing it off as I said above as another super hero flick. Which of course it also is! As Alejandro Frias said in the summary section, it's a mixture of 1984, Phantom of the Opera, and Batman"". <br/><br/>Brilliant, exciting and true : )"

","Alan Moore is not a fan of Hollywood. Who can blame him after watching them butcher his League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen into a brainless popcorn action film that couldn't hold my attention, let alone anyone else. But Moore wasn't a fan of From Hell either. Another bastardized version of a story Moore tells in comic book form. It was style over substance, something that seemed like would happen to this next entry, V For Vendetta.<br/><br/>The film and the graphic novel are really different, so I see myself commenting on this as a film itself and not in any way to the original source material. V For Vendetta excels at many levels. It is well written, directed and acted by everyone involved. It has many levels and doesn't get out done by it's high octane style.<br/><br/>The script is strong and has a faceless ""hero"" or anti-hero, however you look at it. The dialogue is witty, but at times can be a bit much. You either love or hate the introduction V does and if you love it, then you'll most likely love the rest of the film too. The script has a sense of mystery to it and it takes the viewer on the ride of unraveling the truth behind everything. Almost like a murder mystery.<br/><br/>The atmosphere helps the film greatly. It has the British taking power in a Hitler like regime and V uses terrorist acts for freedom. The action junkie expecting some thrills will be really disappointed, the film moves at a relative pace, but it's telling a story, not killing dozens of armed men with explosions.<br/><br/>Portman does a decent job here, she is incredibly cute in her little girl outfit, then later becomes all Ellen Ripley on us. It's bold, beautiful and is a sign of her commitment to the craft.<br/><br/>The film ends up a punch and it leaves you with a smile on your face, the chosen music works perfect with the subject matter and the style of the film. It could be a masterpiece, for it's given genre, but it does have a few missteps, mainly pacing.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this one. It isn't your average comic book flick, it has deeper roots and it is really well done."

Most people know Hugo Weaving for his role as Smith in The Matrix Trilogy, but he was absolutely amazing with his role as V in this film. Natalie Portman cannot go without mention either, because she did superbly as Evey. If you are the type of person who likes memorable quotes in movies, this movie is FULL of them. V speaks in such complex and high-vocabulary tongue, but yet, you understand his message. Another thing that sets V For Vendetta apart from other films is the fact that you don't really know which side is the good guys and which side is the bad guys. But regardless of which side you tend to affiliate yourself with, you find yourself rooting for V. He is undoubtedly one of the most likable characters in the history of movies.<br/><br/>The labels call this movie an ""action"" film. But while it has some great action scenes here and there, the movie as a whole is so much more than that."

","Whereas the Wachowskis' ""Matrix"" trilogy placed more emphasis on the action and effects of the digital age, with the intellectual content coming in a very close second, ""V for Vendetta"" is the other way around, making it actually a better, more satisfying film.<br/><br/>For the first time in her career, Natalie Portman gives a passable (actually much more than) performance as Evey, a working girl who's had to be trained not to think for herself. Along comes V (Hugo Weaving), who starts the whole cycle over again where Evey is concerned: he has a plot to overturn the tyrannical government of his day, and he's offering Evey a place on that very special train.<br/><br/>It's a highly liberal ode to original thinking and the need for justice. In this, as in several other cases, liberal is good. Everything about this film is a call for order, right down to references to America's ""destructive war"" (gee, I wonder what that could mean...).<br/><br/>Cinematically speaking, ""Vendetta"" is also a remarkable accomplishment. From the late Adrian Biddle's elegant cinematography to Dario Marianelli's driving musical score, ""V for Vendetta"" delivers the goods with more explosive force than you'd ever imagine.<br/><br/>If you're not afraid to think, watch ""V for Vendetta.""

","I'll start off by stating that it is rare that I write reviews for movies, but I feel inclined to do so for this one. I will start off by going over the films physical attributes: The film is mostly shot in dimmer lighting which, immediately gives the viewer a sense of discomfort. You feel right away that this society is not an enviable one before there is any significant dialog or action. However, to contrast the dim lighting, all colors are vibrant and all attention to physical detail is very vivid. The cinematography is beautiful and all scenes are shot to their maximum beauty. The explosions could not have been better captured and the easy-going portions of the film give a sense of comfort.<br/><br/>Now let's look at the film's content: There are those that state this film is derived from the book 1984. While there is certainly some influence from this novel, the plot and outcomes are all very different. That being said, I feel that one thing about this movie that makes it so great is that there are no exact outcomes. I will not give away specifics, as I have marked this review without spoilers.<br/><br/>I will conclude by stating that you need to go into this movie with the expectation that you will be seeing a classic. It is not extremely rich in action or violence. Sure, it has a fair share, but those who are going with the expectation that it will be a violent action movie will be disappointed (unless that is not what they wanted in the first place.)"

A'portrayal of a dictators rise to power and the effects on the country trying to retain it. <br/><br/>It can be very wordy at times but always manages to maintain an interest. <br/><br/>It was constantly reminding me somewhat of the classic 1984 and has many similarities.<br/><br/>The story is very convincing, and with all that is happening in the world today not so unbelievable.

"kevgrill","1","2","10","10 December 2006"," Slowww, Segmented, Lacking action, Ambiguous Pretentious Dialogue
","Oh my, who knew a movie with a masked villain/hero with two knifes/sai's on the cover could be so unexciting, drab, and strung out. This movie is on life support...a beat...an hour later another heartbeat...do we have life!? No- false alarm. Never has an action movie snailed along so slow. And- if this is *not* supposed to be an action movie- yet a political satire- or a political editorial on fascism- or whatever you want to call it, then it most certainly fails on that front as well. The movie has no real identity, and if it does, the common viewer won't be able to find it after sorting through the tangled spider webs worth of useless dialogue. The common viewer (that isn't already in love with the comic book) will likely find this movie repulsive as I have. Though the character development is actually very complete (and it pretty much has to be considering the enormous amount of time spent on it) the characters are boring. So Evey's parents are black-bagged, by the time we learn that, do we REALLY care? Maybe you did...or will...but I certainly did not.<br/><br/>It's strange too, because the movies starts very interesting in the first few minutes with a historical snapshot and a town square death. Then we're cast forward instantly to the boring fascist action editorial that never takes flight based on- well, based on utter and complete lack of exciting action -save for one scene at the end where V says his one cool line: ""what you have our bullets..."" Summary: slow, boring, lack of action, too much lame dialogue, too much film made the final cut, idea gets lost in the muck, viewer's attention is not firmly held in place consistently enough to enjoy.<br/><br/>The fans of the comic will likely force themselves to enjoy it and continue to vote it *10*'s on IMDb because of their previous enchantment and attachment to it. Ordinary people like me will continue to see it because it *looks* interesting and will subsequently forget *all* about it approximately 1-5 minutes after the final scene."

","Imagine Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor playing the lead roles in 'Zorro, the Gay Blade.' The performances of Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman were terrific but the movie was just plain silly. There was so much left-wing crap in the plot that Michael Moore should have been given an honorary producer credit. So, if I understand correctly, the U.S. war in Iraq caused Britain to elect a religious leader who brainwashed the entire country to...never mind. It really doesn't matter. David Lloyd and Alan Moore apparently watch too much BBC for their own good. <br/><br/>Natalie Portman's performance made the movie bearable to watch, but it raises an obvious question. Weren't there any British actresses available? What about Rachel Weiz? Natalie's labored accent brings back memories of Brad Pitt's butcher-job in 'The Devil's Own.' It is a distraction from the rest of the movie."

","All I have to say is, who made the choice to make a movie in which the lead character has a plastic face? This may work for a comic book, but man, listening to disembodied diatribe after diatribe was tiresome. No facial expressions, not even some soulful eyes to connect to.. I felt about as connected as I did when watching Final Fantasy and at least they had facial expressions. I'd also like to say that the kiss, although I wanted so much to feel it, made me laugh. A close up on real lips kissing plastic ones is a bit silly.<br/><br/>The whole movie was what I expected.. uneven. Neither good nor awful. I couldn't help but feel like I'd seen most of it before.. and much more enjoyably in Equilibrium. There's a great sci-fi scary political future film. I felt passionate about Christian Bale, and the action was fascinating. The action in V was brief and uninspired. I just think it's nearly impossible to feel anything for a character that is constrained to hide behind heavy black robes, a rigid plastic mask and a large hat. Not even much body language except arm gestures! It was disturbing how much of the movie was spent in closeups of the plastic mask face waxing philosophical on politics."
"stillproph","10","2","10","17 March 2006"," An outrageously good movie
","V for Vendetta exemplifies what writers/directors should be setting out to accomplish when thinking of a movie. Granted, V was an overtly kick-ass character, it still says so much when you watch a movie, and it truly moves you. With Vendetta, the oblivious reference to political structure, and unwaivering control should be relevant to all of us. As a writer/artist myself, I've learned that when you write and create, it should be for the purpose of moving your audience. If you aren't trying to move your audience to an idea, to an ideal...then what are you writing for? While many movies are made with the rhetoric of mere entertainment, Vendetta shines as an upstanding example of, deep down, what all movie goers want from their movies. To be moved. Excuse yourself from the turmoiling task of watching Failure to Launch with your girlfriend....and go see this movie now!"

It reminded me of the terrible Kung Fu movies which have too many cut scenes and not enough real martial arts. This movie relies on gimmicks to push the movie forward and finish scenes.<br/><br/>There are specific scenes which are good and individually I enjoyed them, but equally there are too many scenes which disrupt my ability to suspend reality and stay inside the movie.<br/><br/>I thought the casting was good and the script had some brilliant moments, but the movie does not represent the vision that the graphic novel presented.

","V for Vendetta is most definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. I like not only because of the interesting plot and suspense, violence, (and did i mention NATALIE PORTMAN?) but because it gets the cogs of the brain working a little bit. it makes you think that these exact same things happening in the movie could happen in the near future. it explores the rise of communism/socialism and it explores the concept of when people overcome fear and fear of death what they are capable of. I like the idea that V made everyone want to stand against the government and they all became V. I was somewhat disappointed in the ending. call me a sap but i would have like to seen Evey and V live on after the explosion of parliament but sadly V dies. (sorry if i ruined the movie). I would have like to seen V's and Evey past more explored as well as the virus and experiments that went on, but i know there is only some much u can put in a movie. The whole virus thing kind of reminds me of 28 days later, except the virus didn't turn you into a flesh loving zombie in this movie, and unlike in 28 days later the government didn't create the virus and then make people pay for the cure. Besides i don't like 28 days later that much."

The director did such a good job making this movie dramatic with many 'puzzle' pieces that forced you to be glued to the television, but it defiantly wasn't a bad thing to be forced to watch this for the details, I often found myself willing to pay attention. I had to watch this movie in school and I loved it so much that I went home and rented it for my boyfriend to watch. This is such an intense movie that it never gets boring. There's so many things that get revealed every time you watch it that it never gets boring.

"bjossibjarnst","9","2","11","29 June 2009"," Awesome movie, brilliant comic!
","Before directly talking about the film I'd like to address a few people claiming this movie to be unoriginal, politically incorrect etc. hence giving it a 1-star rating.<br/><br/>Some of those people say it is predictable, unrealistic or full of clichés. Since I have an insatiable urge to defend my viewpoints I can't let this go without saying something. First of all, this is a movie and a movie based on a comic. Don't blame the Wachowski brothers for unoriginality. Second, there is no way to make a movie without clichés, at least it's extremely hard to do so and still make it worth watching. If the director succeeds he has most likely created a masterpiece. Saying it is bad because of the plot being clichéd is rubbish. This was written over 20 years ago. They weren't clichés back then. (note: Cliché is not something that has been done once before) Third, this is fiction. Don't expect it to be realistic. Fiction has no boundaries.<br/><br/>But about the movie. It wasn't perfect, though it was goddamn close. I even applauded a few times while I was sitting in my room watching it, something that hardly ever happens. Also, the magnitude of utter pwnage (for lack of better words) in this movie is astounding. Almost everything from the fight scenes to V's monologues and just the moral of the movie is just plain awesome. Bottom line: Do not rate this movie 1 star to be different. Honestly, I checked one of the user's profile and he had rated movies that most, critics and casual moviegoers alike, think of as a masterpiece 1-star while the only movies that don't have a 1-star rating are old movies that hardly counted as mainstream back when they were released. But enough of my bitterness. This movie was great, I enjoyed it from A through Z. 9/10."
"saarvardi","10","2","11","28 July 2007"," What's so brilliant about Vendetta is that even though it takes place in this vague future, the resemblance to today's worldwide politics is captivating
","""Remember, remember the 5th of November. The gunpowder, treason, and plot. I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot""  (Hugo Weaving as V, the masked freedom fighter from V for Vendetta).<br/><br/>If a person has the ability to change his own path of life, can one person be strong enough to change the course of an entire nation? And besides, who really calls the shots in our society? Is it the decadent and greedy politicians who think no further then their wallets, or is it the people, that elusive entity that presents the collective and unheard voice of the silent public? V for Vendetta takes place in an apocalyptic and futuristic London, a time where the preservative countries have lost their international powers. Great Britain is now ruled by a minority of corrupt leaders who use totalitarian methods to preserve order in the streets and maintain stability of their administration. However, underneath the surface a resistance is slowly rising. The people, it seems, are getting sick of being tortured and bullied around by the street police, and tired of a system that quiets down any attempt of people who think or act differently to raise their head with pride. All this is about to change. <br/><br/>In comes one of our two main heroes, a masked vigilante out for justice, who stops at nothing in his attempts to reveal the startling truth behind the government's actions to the British public. Known only as V, his main role model is Guy Fawkes, a freedom fighter who tried to bring down King James I of England way back in 1605. V befriends Evey Hammond, a teenage girl whom he saves from some government bullies (the monologue scene where he presents himself to her, relying mostly on nouns beginning with the letter V, is one of the more admirable linguistic scenes I've ever scene). V brings Evey (portrayed by Academy Awards nominee Natalie Portman) into his life, and gives her shelter in his secluded hideaway. Their mentor-student relationship plays a large part in the film, as does the real reason why V never takes off his mask. Obviously, not much can be said without going into spoilers for those who haven't seen the film, but it's a hell of a roller-coaster ride  both emotionally wise and plot wise  and the big payoff in the end gives this film one of the most breathtaking and satisfying conclusions ever to be seen on film.<br/><br/>What's so brilliant about Vendetta is that even though it takes place in this vague future, the resemblance to today's worldwide politics is captivating. It brings up many social dilemmas but ultimately deals with a universal theme almost anyone can relate to  the human spirit and its tendency to prevail, even when it seems that all hope is gone. Granted, V uses terror tactics to get his message out throughout the film, and that may be a tad bit tricky because it may make you agree to these methods under extreme circumstances. However, it manages nevertheless to shout out a strong and important message, one that is timeless at that  that terror, even if institutionalized, can never win against the ultimate weapon: man's deterrence to be free; and that desperate times may require desperate means, even if those should be used only as a doomsday weapon. <br/><br/>Directed by relatively anonymous director James McTeigue, it's the film's writers you really ought to be looking out for. The Wachowski Brothers from The Matrix fame are the true people to commemorate for this fine piece of political and philosophical cinema."
"lastliberal","6","2","11","20 May 2007"," What was done to me was monstrous.

He created a great film, written by the Wachowski brothers and starring Natalie Portman of the Latest Star Wars trilogy and Hugo Weaving of Matrix and Lord of the Rings fame.<br/><br/>The action and visual effects were stupendous. Stephen Rea (The Crying Gasme) was great as the inspector trying to find V, and John Hurt (The Elephant man, Midnight Express) was eerie as the man you loved to hate.<br/><br/>It was more than action and visual effects. It was a reminder of what fear can do and the ultimate consequences. Something we will hopefully learn in this country before it is too late, if it isn't already."

The previews to this movie try to tell you that V for Vandetta is as good as the Matrix. This movie comes no where close to the Matrix at any level. No good special effects, story, characters. All garbage. V for Vandetta tells the story of a government that uses fear to try and control people. The main character, V, tries to spark a revolution to overthrow the government.

The movie industry in the United States is going through an extremely rough time right now because of the hostile attitude they take toward conservative Christian values. This attitude is clearly evident in V For Vendetta. People simply don't want to be told that their country is evil and beggarly, Christianity is corrupt and evil, that homosexuality is good and pure, being conservative makes you equivalent to Adolph Hitler and that Islam is the only ""beautiful"" and ""poetic"" religion. These are the mes ages, however subliminal, in this movie therefore it should have been called ""P for Propaganda."" I love the way the movie was put together, the acting was superb and visually stunning. As an adult who can filter out and reject all of the garbage being programmed into me, I was able to enjoy the story for what it was. However I would not suggest that weak minded people who are not established in their own beliefs go see the movie, it could hurt them.

V for Vendetta movie is missing everything that made the book brilliant and revolutionary.

Now, it is quite modernized and Hollywood-ized, so don't expect exactly the same level of sophistication - it does take a few scenes to get used to seeing V, as he does naturally come off as silly on the big screen as compared to his pen-and-inked literary counterpart, but overall it isn't badly done at all. Hugo Weaving does quite an admirable job, too, pulling off the mood of the character perfectly.<br/><br/>I think what I like about this movie is that it manages to not completely suck despite simplifying the original story for theater audiences and adding a gamut of Hollywood action scenes. I mean, everything we loved from the comic is still here. All of the powerful scenes are still at least 95% intact, and while I'm sure it could have been done better, V For Vendetta is a satisfying and thoroughly invigorating film that will not disappoint anyone looking for a quality book-to-movie transition. It's got good acting, some stunning visual hooks and a plot that you will dig right from the start as ""the voice of Fate"" comments on the state of a war torn world.

"sc8031","7","1","4","19 September 2008"," A ""Testament of Dr. Mabuse"" for the new millennium
","""V For Vendetta"" is a film ""The Dark Knight"" could have been -- almost the other side of the same coin. It is marked by a similarly dark protagonist with a more impressive (and dangerous) sense of justice, yet he is an endearing and likable character to the end. Thus it is a true superhero film, for despite its deadpan serious tone, it also retains a variety of comic elements that make the characters and plot deeply engaging to the viewer. <br/><br/>The setting is a totalitarian England of the near future, just after the collapse of the USA and their fumbled invasion in the Middle-East. England is now led by evangelical fascists who do not allow homosexuality, artistic expression, freedom of speech, late-night social activity, and all other kinds of ""luxuries."" The party henchmen all unquestioningly serve a crazed talking head played by John Hurt, who dictates to them through a giant television screen in an obvious reference to the movie adaptation of George Orwell's ""1984"". In the midst of this unpleasant society lives Evey (Natalie Portman), a young woman who works a dead-end job as an assistant in one of the main propaganda TV news studios. The protagonist, freedom fighter ""V"" (Hugo Weaving), accosts her in the streets one night (in typical superhero fashion) and takes their chance meeting to be more than just chance (he doesn't believe in coincidences, as everyone in the film eventually learns). <br/><br/>What makes ""V for Vendetta"" so intoxicating is the way it piles on the horrifying government indictments and heavy-handed polemics in obvious reference to the modern anti-terrorist party-line of the US/UK governments. But the main character repeatedly drives into our brains throughout the film, that as literal as these critiques may be, they (and the movie's entire story) exist merely as symbols, as ideas, which have no original form but continually reappear in contrast to control schemes. So to take everything involved here completely literally would be like taking the Matrix to be the actual hidden reality beneath our day-to-day lives.<br/><br/>But then again, somewhat admirably and dangerously, as they did with ""The Matrix"", here the Wachowski brothers have unveiled their own eccentric, courageous line of thinking -- one which is uncommonly seen delivered in Hollywood with such ""chutzpah"" -- especially nowadays. V brings back some of the best elements of ""The Testament of Dr. Mabuse"", ""Twelve Monkeys"", ""Batman"", ""1984"", and ""Brazil"", and it's a welcome return in lieu of the stagnant soft-fascism of modern mass-consumer-product-ridden film culture. <br/><br/>The film is not without its quirky flaws. By the end of the film, the villains are not quite as loathsome and sinister as they initially appeared to be; their dimensions are stretched a little thin over the 2+ hour movie. And for as much as V references ""Hamlet"" and ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" throughout the film, his tale of vengeance is never quite as fully resonant as anything in these aforementioned works. Additionally, there are some pacing problems about 2/3 of the way through the film, where the story is forced to go through a few montages to speed it up and actually conclude.<br/><br/>But still, even if you think the blatant (almost insane) political tirades are ridiculous, cheesy, inauthentic, exaggerated or offensive, the movie is well-made with some quality perks. The protagonist V has some awesome (sometimes hysterical) lines, and there are a couple of good twists to the film's story. V's first appearance and lines early on are some of the best in the film and Hugo Weaving gives an incredibly enjoyable performance using an endearing method of dead-pan delivery and expressive, jerky body language. And watch for the fight scene where the film pokes fun at the choreography and special effects from ""The Matrix"" (the director here was the Assistant Director for The Matrix series).<br/><br/>Although the movie is by no means perfect, and certainly unrealistic and at times illogical, it is a fantastic action/suspense film and evokes ""The Matrix"" and ""The Dark Knight"" with its cohesive and immersing plot, likable protagonist, endearing performances and insanely bold message. The worst thing you could say is that it's unique, which is certainly no insult in today's movie market."
"Tweekums","8","1","4","24 June 2008"," An Interesting Dystopia
","Like most dystopias this is set a little while into the future and takes the worst excesses of today to a totalitarian extreme. Here Britain is governed by High Chancellor Sutler, played by the excellent John Hurt. We learn that he came to power after a terrorist outrage that left tens of thousands of people dead. Once elected he had set about building a police state where undesirables were eliminated.<br/><br/>The main character of the film is Evey (Natalie Portman with a slightly dodgy accent), a girl who is rescued from the police by a masked man known only as V, played by Hugo Weaving who performs well in a role where we never see his face as it is always covered by hid Guy Falkes mask.<br/><br/>Shortly after rescuing her he takes her to a rooftop to watch as he detonates explosives that he has planted under the Old Bailey. He then announces that that in one years time, on the fifth of November he will blow up the now disused Houses of Parliament. He also sets about killing a group of people who have wronged him in the past. Inspector Finch, an honest policeman played well by Stephen Rea is tasked with bringing V to justice. The more he learns about V's victims and their connection to the government the more disturbed be becomes.<br/><br/>Many viewers seem to consider this a left wing film that is attacking right wing values by taking them to an extreme; I never thought that though, to me it is a film about the evil of tyranny which would have worked in exactly the same way had the government been Stalinist.<br/><br/>The acting is good throughout, the secondary characters were also impressive, especially Stephen Fry who played a television presenter who sheltered Evey at one point, in many ways his character is the non-violent equivalent of V, they even cook the same thing for breakfast."

","I 've read many good reviews about this film. Once I watched it I realized it is actually a really good one so I definitely recommend it to everyone who don't want to watch yet an ordinary and boring adventure film. It combines almost everything, so it's a film which can be watched by everyone. And the most important thing for me, the ending; it isn't just an another silly happy ending where everyone is happy and gets married! So if I have to say what really touched me in this film, this is definitely the ending (I couldn't think of a better one!) and this memorable phrase; ""Remember, Remember the 5th of November"". The rest of the film is equally good. The cast and crew did a good job! I suggest you go and watch the film 'cause it does worth it! It won 't let you down!"

","The graphic novel on which this Wachowski Brother's film is based was an allegory of Thatcher's Britain of the Eighties, so it's surprising how well (or even better) it works as a similar allegory of Blair's duplicitous government in the wake of 9/11. Truth is spun by men in suits into something unrecognisable, civilians are spied upon, and are subjugated by the skilled exploitation of their fears Â– which have largely been invoked by the very people who exploit them. The fact that a film which has, truthfully, to be lumped into the superhero genre, is so prescient is incredible.<br/><br/>The film is in the grand guignol style; our (anti)-hero, a masked phantom of the opera type who lives in what looks like a castle, is reminiscent, at times, of the swashbuckling types from Hollywood flicks of the thirties and forties: a last musketeer, still using blades when the rest of the world has moved on to semi-automatics. But that's the way it has to be, because V is a throwback to an earlier time; a time when heroes were honourable men who defended our land rather than our goalmouth, and social disorder was a result of grievance rather than greed. Weaving is very good behind his mask, while Portman makes a fetching heroine. John Hurt, Winston Smith in a film of which this is a recognisable descendant, is a nice touch as the fascist dictator whom V seeks to depose. Rea, however, has a thankless role, as the plodding policeman always one step behind.<br/><br/>Despite the way it was marketed, this isn't a film for the hardcore action fan. The story's a little convoluted (although that's not necessarily a criticism) and there's as much going on behind the scenes as there is on the screen."

","I'd heard some stuff about this movie and most of it was criticism. As a result of this I've only just got round to seeing it. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Although the character is masked you are still able to connect with him and his plight. The film poses many questions about who is responsible for our society, us or the people whom govern us. Individually and collectively we are all responsible. This simple yet paradoxically complex premise is at the heart of this piece. However, the context in which the story is played out adds another dimension to this idea, in my opinion it adds to it successfully. One of the best comic book to screen adaptations I've seen. It is old fashioned in many ways but that just adds to the charm of the movie. The dialogue of the main character is superb, it adds to his mystique, Hugo Weaving does an excellent job considering the limitations posed by being masked. In many ways the film paid homage to Vincent Price and all those old movies from another era. If you have not seen it and your looking for something a little different...."

I must give props to the casting director, because these actors were perfect for their roles. I wish that I had never seen this movie, just so I could see it again for the first time. I watched it again recently, and it didn't have the same impact as the first time I saw it. It was good, just not as good knowing the surprises and such. As this was said not to be a completely action-oriented movie, it's action surpassed anything I could have imagined. I would recommend seeing this movie if one hasn't already, and I might also suggest checking out the soundtrack as well. The beautiful music that plays within the movie works perfectly for the mood of the film."
"kctotal","10","1","4","25 March 2007"," One of the best comic book adaptations
","As soon as the first few posters of V appeared at the local multiplexes, everyone knew that it was going to be something special. Then you see it was produced by the producers of League of Extraordinary Gentleman. That film was almost risible and so yet another Alan Moore comic-book adaptation went wrong. The only hope that Moore's work would be finely adapted was in V for Vendetta, which turns out to be everything that the other ones were not. Set in the future, the film shows a country ruled by a fascist government headed by the scheming High Chancellor. The people are so clouded by fear that they do not rebel. That is until the cloaked V shows up to wreck havoc and to bring the government's wrong doings to the light. In his plan to do so, he is aided by the innocent Evey, who after being rescued by V, is introduced to a world she had never seen before. To maximize a good film to the full, there is need of a good cast, and V unfortunately falls short of reasonably good performances. Natalie Portman is as good as ever, and her portrayal of Evey stood out next to the others, which were by far more mediocre. She effortlessly handles that typical British accent, and even though I doubt you will ever be moved by her tears, she was still credible for most of the film. The real problem is V. Hugo Weaving does an adequate job of expressing his with sinister nods and head tilts, but there was still very little emotion and it was therefore very wooden. He handles his action scenes very well, but that is still not enough to make his character not beg for belief. John Hurt's interpretation as the High Chancellor is also one of those few who excel. His scenes overflow with menace and hidden desperation. That said, the film is good on many accounts. The action is limited, but the few scenes are violent and blood is plentiful, which is not so common these days. The slow-mo knife-time sequences are brilliant as are the few big explosions in the film. The film also has an interesting political background, which gave the film a more realistic image. The problem is that the film rarely probes into some questions which arise, and it fails to give some scenes the adequate emotional content. However, a couple of scenes speak for themselves. The scene in which V loads an underground train with loads of explosives reminded me of the terrible underground terrorist attacks in London a year ago. This thought was enough to give me the chills. <br/><br/>I also admire the director's decision to never take of V's mask. Thus, this avoided the common Phantom of the Opera shock and the identity revelation as in Spiderman 2 and Batman Begins. Instead, we are left to imagine how his face and ultimately, his whole body, may look like. Speaking of appearances, it is also horrific to see Evey tortured and have her hair shaved off. Yet these startling images help fortify the message the film tries to deliver. Good and to the point, V for Vendetta drives its point home easily. Pity it doesn't have a better cast."

","Hopefully this is not the future of the world that we live in. To watch any movie like V for Vendetta with evil rulers and futuristic totalitarian governments always gives me an edge and feeling of some uneasiness and scariness afterward. In the movie, set in the year 2038 there is a future England ruled by a Fascist dictator in a society similar to that of 20th century Nazi Germany. What is more appalling is that England apparently seems to have re-conquered at least in part the United States which is continually referred to throughout the film as ""the former United States"". This is definitely an interesting movie to watch but scary to think about in reality.<br/><br/>Overall, this is quite a good film. The idea of a great revolutionary (for I simply refuse to call V a terrorist---- though I will not object to putting that label on the Fascist Norsefire Party) who fights and stands for what's right even in the face of opposition of an evil totalitarian government is certainly makes for a good film. However I'll give it a 9 as it is hard to give any movie like this a 10 because it is scary. Well (hopefully) it's just a movie."

","I saw this movie when it was realised in the UK last year. I knew in advance that is was based on a comic novel, but I did not let that put me off! In my opinion, this would be a good movie for the disinterested in politics younger generation. There seems to be relatively few young people who are concerned about the gradual erosion of our freedom and civil liberties in this country, for example, the introduction of ID cards, the paternalistic government which tries to become involved in every aspect of a person's life and, more worryingly, the gradual erosion of our basic freedoms under the guise of protection for the ordinary citizen. Unfortunately, in this vision of the future, it soon becomes unclear who are the bad guys. Any voices of dissent are brutally disposed of. The government will protect you from all those who are out to get you, but at an exceedingly costly price. The erosion of our freedom.<br/><br/>Rant over! This movie addresses some of the above points. My only problem was that I felt it was over-simplistic, perhaps because it was aimed at a younger and largely uninformed audience.<br/><br/>To move on to the film itself, I cannot deny that it was pretty exciting, in particular the explosions made for a visual treat. Hugo Weaving was terrific as the masked vigilante. It can be no easy feat for an actor to play a whole role covered in a mask and yet still come across as a subtle and multi-layered character. Natalie Portman made an OK Evey, I did not think she was fiery enough for the role, her big contribution seemed to be getting her head shaved for a scene in the movie. Some of the cast were caricatures, especially John Hurt, the leader of the party who had totally taken over the UK. A far better character was the policeman played by Stephen Rea. A character struggling against upholding laws he knows are wrong, but eventually he sees the light.<br/><br/>Basically the movie warns against being complacent when the government insists they are doing things for 'your own good'. Things are not always black and white and a country like Britain, where 'freedom' is somewhat taken for granted today, could, given certain circumstances turn into a police state.<br/><br/>In summary, exciting but simplistic and unlikely to stir adult mature debate on what constitutes freedom in Western Civilisation."
"refresh_daemon","7","1","4","1 February 2007"," Not mind-blowing, but okay
","I watched this film during my trip to Seattle. Before watching it, Chris let us know it's more of a dialogue film than an action film so I kept that in mind as I watched the film and he was right. There are very short bursts of action, but most of the film is a mystery film (not too mysterious) and a lot of lite-philosophical dialogue about the nature of tyranny.<br/><br/>I'll start with the action--the little there was was pretty stylish and all. The setups and shots are very comic-book-ey, but they are dynamic enough not to seem overtly so. My largest quibble with the action segments of the film are the presence of the ""speed-lines"" around the daggers. Nick commented that it made him think that it made V seem too much like a video game and suddenly the dagger throwing seemed a little too much like Street Fighter II and made it rather silly in hindsight.<br/><br/>Then there's the rest of the film. A huge mess of a story, which had the potential to be really really cool and full of deep thought about the nature of tyranny, the role of government, whether the ends justify the means and all... but no. No. We're treated to thought-lite. The film is mostly a single perspective film and although it starts with a contrast with Natalie Portman's Evey vs. V, eventually everyone becomes a fan of V. As the movie ends, Malcolm X is quoted. And all the potential dialogue in the film to reflect on the overall ideas that are inherent to the concept of the film are overshadowed by the shallow ideas of ""you can't kill an idea"" and ""the ends justify the means"". The biggest problem is that the film never really resolves the philosophical conflict that is brought up earlier, but instead sweeps it aside by having Evey undergo a ""transformation"".<br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing that was a little ridiculous--the film hits us over the head with parallelism too much, especially between Evey's transformation and V's. It might've been cool in the comics, but it was redundant in the film. I was thinking ""geez, I get it already, can we move on to something worthwhile?"" Despite that V is at heart an empty, shallow, madman, his persona is very likable. His opening monologue is a extremely long and very impressive alliteration of v's. His showmanship and his flash are enjoyable, even if his murdering is despicable. His manner when he's not running around being a terrorist is very likable and doesn't really have too much of a trace of Hugo ""Agent Smith"" Weaving's persona. Of course, he still leaks out elsewhere in the movie. As for Evey--she's not a very strong character. Since her will and ideology are so flimsy and her character, despite the backstory development, isn't much more than an analogue to V, she's basically an ideological vessel and it's difficult to connect with her as such. The best character to connect with is the Inspector and even then, his own ideological issues aren't fully addressed in the end.<br/><br/>In the end, the pomp and show make the film a lot more enjoyable than it should be for its trite musings and blunt message. The performances don't detract from the film, the action and art direction is stylish. The dialogue is survivable enough and not as overblown as the Matrix sequels. It's a blockbuster and a viable one at that. But don't go expecting a mind-blowing experience, as the movie is made to be easily digestible by the masses and it certainly doesn't stick with you for too long after the credits roll. My vote: It's okay. 7/10."
"tatwin","9","1","4","16 January 2007"," An Outstanding Movie Experience
","I've read other people's opinions on this movie and wonder when people have lost sight of what movies are for--to entertain us. I suppose it's easy to read many things into the meaning of movie stories, but all too often, into pure fiction are read far too many religious and political morays. What most fiction movies attempt to do is transport us, for 2 hours or so, into another world, to tell us a story while it entertains us. This is not a fictional story, based upon true history or events--it is purely fiction for entertainment purposes.<br/><br/>What V for Vendetta does, is give us a story that is visually stunning and thought provoking. There are two actual story threads being told here--the current story of V, Evey, and the politics of their time, as well as the back story of V and how he came to be. There is a lot of intriguing information here and the writer and director wove it into the plot in a masterful and meaningful way. There are many cultural overtones and the story addresses political corruption and intolerance, but not in a way that tries to influence the viewer in any way. The movie's message is one of tolerance and justice.<br/><br/>The main character, V, is on a vendetta to eradicate those in the government that have both wronged him, and created the corrupt world in which they live. He befriends a young woman--a relationship that changes and grows in a most unusual way. V has adopted the personal of Guy Fawkes, a historical freedom fighter, and wears a Guy Fawkes mask and guise throughout the movie to conceal the disfigurement done to him by government-commissioned biological experiments.<br/><br/>Whether or not the movie script stays loyal to the original story is irrelevant. Many movies greatly stray from their original books or stories. What matters is what you see, feel and experience during the time you spend with ""V,"" and how well it tells its own screen story. And this is what has been done so very well. Natalie Portman gives her best performance since ""The Professional,"" Stephen Rhea is outstanding, John Hurt is perfect in his role, but it is Hugo Weaving who brings V to life and delivers such a wonderful charismatic character. We never see his face. The entire character is done by delivering a simply stunning vocal performance, perfect inflections, and well placed and executed nods of his masked head. Mr. Weaving's performance of this character is exquisite. <br/><br/>For sheer entertainment purposes, you can't get much better than V for Vendetta."

To those who claim that the film is morally dubious in its justification of terrorism, I can only reply that I completely see your point. However, I admittedly didn't take its message all that seriously, and instead took it for what it was -- a fantasist's impression of what a worst-case scenario near future will look like, and a rabble rouser's cry to people asking them not to forget that they should control their governments, not the reverse. If it's full of post-9/11 trappings to make its message more resonant, all the better.

","Have you been forced to watch a film you didn't want to? And found it had a tremendous impact on your life. I had that experience with V For Vendetta. I try not to prejudge films. I firmly believe you can't know one unless you actually sit down and watch it. But occasionally I don't want to see a film because I'm sure it won't be any good. And was proved wrong. It happened with Collateral. And Sky Captain. Both films that have become firm favourites of mine. And now V For Vendetta.<br/><br/>V For Vendetta is a film with more resonance for a British audience, because it addresses the events of November 5th. Guy Fawkes tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605. Every year people all over England set off fireworks and build bonfires to commemorate the event. Although a more honest reason would be because they like to see fireworks. I don't think the schoolchildren of today are really that interested in Guy Fawkes. They probably don't even know who he is.<br/><br/>But after watching V For Vendetta, there may be a lot of people with a newfound appreciation for the 5th November. I know I do. Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, V For Vendetta is set in the near future. 20 years from now. Britain is controlled by a totalitarian government, led by the tyrannical Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt in full power mad mode). Personal freedoms are no longer a choice. Everything is under Sutler's strict control. Including the media. Education. Everything.<br/><br/>Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) works for the British Television Network. She was the daughter of parents who spoke out against the iron fist of Sutler. Eventually they were captured and executed for being enemies of the state. Evey didn't have the courage to stand up to the government, and is prepared to work for a network that spreads the lies of Sutler if it means keeping her safe. Still, she's not completely under their thumb. She is prepared to break curfew (yes there are curfews in the future). And when she is caught after hours, she is set upon by the FingerMen, hired thugs who keep order.<br/><br/>Evey is rescued by V (a marvellous performance from Hugo Weaving). A self appointed defender of human freedoms, the masked V takes Evey under his wing. V wishes to break the oppression of the government. And to prove his point, he blows up the Old Bailey on November 5th. Despite Sutler's attempts to fool people into believing the Old Bailey's destruction was simple demolition, V hijacks the network, and makes a statement. A year from now, he will finish what Guy Fawkes started 400 years ago. He will destroy the Houses of Parliament, shatter the old world order, and make way for a new one.<br/><br/>V For Vendetta is certainly an ambitious film. Although the action is confined to Britain, it makes a few pointed barbs that reflect upon the politics of today. Like Bush and Tony Blair's attempts to intervene in Iraq, and inciting a conflict for weapons of mass destruction that were never found. V is a freedom fighter. Or a terrorist. It depends on your viewpoint. But he clearly believes in his cause if it means fighting for a better tomorrow.<br/><br/>Although the idea of a dystopian future isn't a new conceit, V For Vendetta is clever the way it portrays 2020 as not too futuristic, but not too contemporary either. About 50 years ago, everyone assumed by 2000 we'd be living in colonies on the Moon, flying hover-cars and robots would be our servants. Of course since we haven't accomplished any of those things, V For Vendetta is careful of its interpretation of the future. One example is the big screens Sutler appears on when addressing his minions, but we still have families in front of regular TVs at home.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving gives an outstanding performance as V. We never see his face, but his voice alone is more than enough to carry the courage of his convictions. His relationship with Natalie Portman is nicely explored in a Beauty and the Beast/Phantom of the Opera sort of way. V gets a lot of great speeches about how we the people have lost our way, and allow ourselves to be cowed by an oppressive government. There is a certain amount of ambiguity to his character. Is he a hero? A terrorist? Or is he the monster throughout all this? Some of his scenes are amusing too. Like the sight of him in an apron making breakfast for Evey. Or the two of them watching The Count of Monte Cristo. His favourite film.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is OK. Her British accent tends to wander. But she is quite watchable. The scenes where she is seemingly thrown into prison, tortured, interrogated, and corresponds with a cell-mate who was incarcerated for being a lesbian are heart-wrenching. The camera-work creates an oppressive atmosphere, and when it turns out to have been a test of loyalty to V, we really feel her sense of betrayal. The scene where she stands in the rain relishing her freedom is very uplifting. It reminded me of The Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>As time ticks away to November 5th, there is something extremely liberating as V awakens the civic pride of the people. I really came to commend their bravery. Like Stephen Fry's character. A TV exec who's a closet homosexual. But inspired by V, he stages a live televised spoof that attacks Sutler's principles. And pays the price for his heroism.<br/><br/>The final 25 minutes are fantastic. The icing on the cake. The Houses of Parliament and Big Ben being destroyed to the sound of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture are very exhilarating. That may be an odd attitude to have, but it never fails to lift my spirits. Obliterating a corrupt today for a freer tomorrow.<br/><br/>Marvellous. Pure and simple."

","There are two kinds of movies that are based on superheroes or comics: those ones which put the story behind all kind of digital effects and stuff, and those others that use the effects only to empathize the story.

","I have just watched this film and thoroughly enjoyed it on at least 3 levels.<br/><br/>Firstly it was a piece of work of the high standard that I have come to expect from the Wachowski brothers. The moody lighting the grand scale of some of the shots the ability to you actually feel some of the oppression leaking out of the screen these are things that I know and expect from this pair. The last action scene is Matrix-esquire (new word? I copy write it if it is lol) but that suits me fine it was very well executed. <br/><br/>Secondly: Within the context of the film you can feel some affinity for the people who have suffered under this regime I found myself drawn into their lives and sympathising with their plight.<br/><br/>Lastly: Is really down to the fortuitous timing of this film. In a U.K. in which we are the most surveilled people in the world already, where Hate crime is on the increase and intolerance is beginning to be almost promoted by a population who are scared and feel they have no voice it is easy to see how this population might sell freedoms in exchange for 'security'.... but at what price? This film is a wonderful comment on the world that is."
"cblake4","10","1","4","14 November 2006"," I might be wrong but V for vendetta has a biblical background story that it is based on and if you know the story i speak of the movie makes much more sense.
","This movie was extremely interesting when I first started to watch it I realized from the very beginning what the story was about. I know it is about a freedom fighter named v, but it also is the story of the book of Revelations in the bible. If you recall in the movie at the beginning when V meets the Evey for the first time he asks her for her name. She replies ""Evey"" and he starts talking about how he doesn't roll dice or take chances. This, in my opinion, is because her name is Evey, I'm not positive but I think just because of her name Evey, that she has a chance of being evil and V was about to kill her until she helped him with the guard. Another thing that makes this seem like the story of Revelation is because of how he tells Evey that he wants her to come to a stage and watch an Orchestra. When she gets on top of the building she wonders where the stage is. V then tells her that it couldn't be a more perfect stage and he magically makes the music blare throughout the country. In a biblical sense this is the same as Gabriels horn that only the worthy can hear. The reason V wants everyone to remember the day that he first appeared on the scene is because it is the day that the final judgment has started and will be remembered for the rest of eternity. Like I said I might be wrong on this one but it is just the story I picked up while watching the movie. So if a lot of things didn't make sense to you in the movie it would help if you read Revalations in the bible and then watched the movie. It helps you pick up on everything that this mysterious V is saying."

","Rarely is an anti-hero given such an archetype character to play. Brilliant driven, and absolutely in control of everything. Except the person he cares about. Hugo Weaving electing to play the character completely in costume and never allowing his real face to be seen gives him a chance to show off Oscar caliber acting chops. His body language and vocal quality are even more mesmerizing with no facial expression other than the Fawkes mask he hides his deformed face behind.<br/><br/>The subject matter is excellent. How do you bring a country back under the control of the people when in their fear they have given up all control. How do you punish the people responsible for unspeakable crimes, even when these people have made those crimes legal? It is also rare that a movie of a comic book trusts its source material enough to be so faithful to the original, and yet add new dimension. Brilliantly written, brilliantly directed, and brilliantly acted. One of my all time favorite movies."

","The Wachoski brother's have come back strong with this one. Although I usually reject on principle science fiction that is culturally stylized after days gone by and did so at the beginning of this movie, but then I found that it truly seems to work in this picture. It's the revival of the classical take on democracy and freedom through the collected black listed material of V and other secretive rebels that lends such authenticity to the backdrop. Other things this movie had going for it: one, a musical rhythm that saturated the pacing of the plot from beginning to end with metaphors for music with the explosions and then again with actual music; two, very artistically driven characters, a trait which gathers sympathy for the rebels (before you even know how they have been subverted or why we should feel for them) by appealing to the emotional side of the brain; three, a very nuanced, intricate and layered diegesis with false characters and hazy pasts; and four, timing, as in being in the right place in the right time with all the unclear (at the very least) dealings of our governments (both British and American). These elements come together to create a stellar politically driven science fiction film which makes it important, not just in movie history but in narrative history in general. And the Performances . . . all were of certain caliber not often seen in movies these days."

It's the kind of movie that can be watched just for the fighting, but I liked the fact that if you followed the plot it was even better. It did take a second time for me to catch everything, but when it is a good movie I don't mind watching it again. The story brought up many good points about how a government can begin democratic but become corrupt and become a dictatorship. The plot of the movie showed what many people wish they could do to stop the corruption and give the people back their rights, although this is an extreme of what most people think of when they think of trying to get the rights of the people back."

"EddieVilliers","10","1","4","17 October 2006"," V for Veritas
","This is a true genius of a movie. I have seen work done by Wacowski Bros (WB) such as Bound and the Matrix Trilogy, and I must admit the Matrix sequels put me off my appetite - you simply can't make 2 hour action sequences and put some story as a breather. Those two movies undo the credit that WB had earned with their earlier fair as independent movie makers.<br/><br/>But in 'V for Vendetta' they seem to have regained their ability to write taut scripts. However, V for Vendetta is no lite fair. The complex, nuanced plot that carries a social message is backed very strongly with great direction and acting. To an extent all countries in the world are suffering from all the social problems depicted in the movie, however, the message is that do not let 'your fear rob you of your common sense' as V himself put it.<br/><br/>I would not like to get in the nitty-gritty of the plot details simply because the movie does an extraordinary job at it and I will certainly reduce this superior movie to a mediocre story.<br/><br/>Saying Hugo Weaving is a good actor is an understatement. His portrayal as V is impeccable and even with his face hidden behind the mask, he has managed to portray V with great physicality. His voice lends the character subtlety, culture, intelligence and daresay even humanity. Natalie Portman's Evey Hammond goes through cathartic changes during the course of the movie and she portrays the changes with great integrity, dignity, substance and makes the character more rounded. Other than the lead actors the support cast is also great - John Hurt as the High Chancellor Adam Sutler is ruthless and a zealot as he should be while Stephen Rea as Chief Inspector Finch is a complex character, a good guy with a conscious whose job is to support an oppressive government.<br/><br/>The director and cinematographer capture the atmosphere of oppression and fear with great ease. The story constantly remains grounded in this atmosphere, which gives it a sense of urgency and realism at the same time. The actors as well as the script have been controlled to avoid making the fare melodramatic and yet remain human.<br/><br/>All in all 'V For Vendetta' is a movie to be watched and experienced. I will rate this as the best movie by Wachoski Brothers till date and give the movie 10/10."
"kan-12","9","1","4","12 October 2006"," V for Very Underrated
","This film came and went in movie theatres in the U.S. barely registering a blip on the radar. Just when I wanted to see it it was out of the theatres. Thank God for Pay Per View! This was a true 21st Century Noir masterpiece. I loved the ""Matrix"" but freed my mind when it came to ""V for Vendetta."" Unfortunately, I'm sure it put off many ""Matrix"" fans because it was extremely different stylistically--far more subtle, verbally nuanced and in some ways old-fashioned. Our hero lives in something akin to the Bat Cave and wears the mask of a 17th century revolutionary (complete with black cloak). But the story is eternal and one need not be a genius to see where it fits into today's society replete with corrupt government officials and an apathetic and (seemingly) powerless populace.<br/><br/>True to its classical sensibility there is a love story between the hero and the pygmalionned heroine (who begins timid and weak and ends up discovering her hidden strengths). But also miles away from Hollywood, a lasting connection between the politically motivated lovers is doomed. The best part about it is that (""Matrix"") actor Hugo Weaving performs with real thespian finesse even through a mask (which is cleverly--as far as cinematic devices go--never taken off, maintaining the mystery of the larger-than-life recalcitrant figurehead).<br/><br/>With an Orwellian tone and its similar penchant for depicting a future state that mixes antiquity, dystopian modernity and present-day disenchantment, ""V for Vendetta"" is destined to be positively reevaluated by the masses or at the very least to become a huge cult classic. ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."" Vive la resistance!"
"robchat","10","1","4","6 October 2006"," Unique, emotional and truly thought-provoking - this is a brave film
","V for Vendetta is a political thriller funded by Britain and Germany about a terrorist super hero - not your typical Hollywood blockbuster! It is based on the graphic novel of the same name and was written by The Matrix writers, The Wachowski Brothers.<br/><br/>The film opens with Guy Fawkes attempting to blow up the Houses of Parliament on the 5th of November, 1605. This date, now known as Guy Fawkes Night, Bonfire Night or Fireworks Night, is celebrated every year in the United Kingdom when we have huge public bonfires on which a dummy or guy is set alight.<br/><br/>Everybody in the UK knows the story of Guy Fawkes, but few people question why he would have wanted to do such a thing - this film does.<br/><br/>It tells the story of a political idealist code-named V who has chosen freedom over oppression, seeking the complete reformation of the one-party fascist police state that is now England.<br/><br/>Clearly a reference to Nazi-Germany, but also a reference to the post-9/11 world that we live in today, this film shows us a dystopian England which came about as a consequence of a war started by the USA , which left the US destitute, almost doing the same to its Coalition of the Willing, ie. England.<br/><br/>But as the war is brought to London, Sutler, the extremely religious Undersecretary for Defence of the Conservative party (played by John Hurt), launches a secret project in the name of national security - the holocaustal mass experimentation on society's degenerates, namely homosexuals, ethnic minorities and religious minorities, in order to develop a virus that can be used as a weapon against alien threats.<br/><br/>But instead, the virus is secretly used on Britain and Ireland, and when the public fear there is no more hope, Sutler comes forward with a vaccination. With the public now looking up to him to sort out the country, Sutler appoints himself the newly created position of high chancellor and the malign authoritarian state is formed under the new dictatorship named Norsefire.<br/><br/>Already it can be seen that this film raises some serious and very relevant points; for example, whether or not a perceived outside threat justifies a diminution in civil liberties. In the UK today, the government is creating some quite oppressive laws, such as being able to detain suspected terrorists almost indefinitely without proof of guilt, in the name of making the country safer.<br/><br/>I am not saying that this film portrays a realistic future; V for Vendetta clearly takes place in a fictional world with a comic book reality, but it is because this story's action packed story is so cleverly weaved into such a serious plot line that this Hollywood film is so brave.<br/><br/>Stephen Fry's character, for example, is murdered because he owns a Koran, and the character V, played by Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith in The Matrix) is in fact the hero and the terrorist of the story! Believing that ""violence can be used for good"", his vengeful and violent approach to justice taints his political idealism and leaves you disagreeing with and, at times, truly disliking the story's hero.<br/><br/>V even tortures Natalie Portman's character, Evey, and uses the murder of her family to teach her not to fear death and be prepared to die for the coming revolution.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is superb from all concerned, the action is big budget and yet the story is very intelligent. V for Vendetta is unique, emotional and truly thought-provoking."

The film is a beautiful tapestry which caters to those with a taste for the theatrical, and those with a hardcore love of modern film and cinematography. The dialogue is startlingly well organized and delivered, thanks to the skill of Hugo Weaving, and the film contains classic elements of dialogue and acting which may have been thrown by the wayside since the great films of the 50's and even into the 60's and 70's.

","I just saw this movie yesterday after having wanted to see it ever since I saw the theatrical trailer for it. I can say that it was very well worth the wait. This movie packs everything that defines what a good action movie should be. The things that make this the best movie, in my opinion, are the action sequences, the dialogue, the persona for the characters, and the acting done by the actors.<br/><br/>The action scenes that they laid out for this movie were perfect and beautifully done and didn't contain all these martial arts moves that you know are humanly impossible to pull off. I won't spoil any part of the movie but the last fight scene of the movie almost gave me a joygasm :P I particularly liked the fact that V used no guns what so ever and relied strictly on his hand to hand combat skills and his abilities with his blades.<br/><br/>The dialogue of V left me speechless. From his introduction to Evey to his last words in the movie, they were thought up so perfectly that its almost hard to find words to describe it all. Everyone who worked on this movie, especially the directors, deserve several awards for it.<br/><br/>Every characters...well...character in this movie was brilliant even to the minor characters. V was, of course, my favorite due to his good guy persona that came equipped with his dark and some what psychotic moments, and his kind, caring, and innocent moments. Many of the characters in this movie remind me of the McManus brothers for Boondock Saints, how they know the system of government is corrupt and finally decide to take matters into their own hands. Of course none of the people in V For Vendetta were ""commanded"" by God to kill all the bad guys they came across :P Lastly of the four is the actual acting itself. They couldn't have chosen a better actor than Hugo Weaving to play V or a better actor to play the Hitler like Sutter. Hugo should definitely get several awards for his acting performance in this movie, especially with the V filled sentences that he spoke to Evey in the beginning, I didn't know some of those words were actual words.<br/><br/>Long story short, ladies and gentlemen, is that I can find nothing wrong with this movie what so ever. Everything is so well done that it makes me want to watch it over and over and over again. Even the political part of the movie is nicely done and I can even understand it (I horribly suck when it comes to politics). I know several people will get upset because they think that the US is being bashed in this as well as Christianity but if you actually watch the movie and pay attention, you'll see that nothing like that is going on. Go out, buy this movie, watch is several times, and cherish it forever."
"denis888","5","1","4","24 August 2006"," 50 / 50 - Both Good and Bad
","Well, what a difficult task! This is the film that has to be good, but sadly it is not. Let me subdivide all the good and bad things into two groups. Good things: 1. Natalie Portman - she has always been one of my all-time favorite actresses. And here she plays with a great gusto, with such unrestrained passion that you feel what she feels - pain, joy, stupor. Even bald, she is awesome! 2. Inspector Finch's part - the best role here, in fact. The man is solid, cool and he is so full of inner pain and desire to find the truth that his part becomes nearly the central in the film. 3. The main ""Baddie""- the Chancellor - looks so pathetic, but then is full of threat and evil. A good, full fledged portrait of a modern dictator, who rejects so many things but eats the forbidden food in secret. 4. The Archbishop - terrible libertine, old and full of vice. This is a great image of a lustful person who in fact has to be otherwise.<br/><br/>Bad things: 1. V himself. Unbearbale bore! His endless speeches were intended to be the acidic acerbic diatribes, but sound so falsely, so pathetic and so pompous that simply make you laugh. His play? Poor Hugo Weaving - does he play, after all? Nay, he just twists and shakes and fights like Neo in Matrix. C'mon, Hugo, Mr. Anderson is in another film! 2. The anti-fundamentalist sentiments. It is clear that the Wachowski Brothers are deadly afraid of the Right-Wing republican Fundamentalists, and so they picture them as a gang of Nazi-like, gay-hating, bloody liars. Come on, men! This is so obvious and so funny! Look, everybody has the right to express himself or herself freely, but your anger and hatred are so clear and so funnily childish. <br/><br/>In general, there is one thing that explains all - on the Bonus DVD disc there is a footage about the comics - well, if the whole film is based on comic strip, what can we await of it? 1."
"simduf","5","1","4","16 August 2006"," I think I missed something
","I just watched ""V"" last night after a fairly long wait. Truth be known, whatever was said about the film wasn't enough to excite me to rent in on my own but my gf wanted to see it so here goes.<br/><br/>Neither of us truly enjoyed it on any level, I have to say. I'm surprised everyones review is so good because it indicates that clearly I am missing something. At the core of the film, it is mostly a government conspiracy plot, politicians unleash a virus on England and then produce a cure, become rich and powerful and the person who knows the truth seeks revenge and frees England from oppression with murder and chaos. Sounds fairly cool, doesn't it? I guess my main problem with ""V"" is the lack of background at the beginning, and we miss a lot of ""when"" and ""where"" and ""why"" to actually get involved in any of that. 45 mins in the film you're still not sure who the bad guys are, what they have done and so on... There is a certain amount of knife play and SWOOSH SWOOSH CLANG CLANG, but it's all meaningless until some explanations come. So the story is not bad, but it's told backwards(shoot first and ask questions later), plus they thought it would be a good idea to add a ton of subplots to make the film more appealing(Hitler, concentration camps, gay rights, terrorists, and so on). As far as I am concerned, it does make the film denser but also more confusing for a lot of people, I'll admit, including myself.<br/><br/>Brilliantly shot though. Some scenes simply wowed me by their quality of lighting, editing, mostly in the intro. Art design was also very polished and it helped me engage in the film. But the bottom line is, did the story appeal to me? I have to say no. It's different and refreshing. It tries hard to stay away from conventional story-telling and bring us something unique but something just gets lost in the way. It's one of those films that just begs to be watched a second time to get all the nuances but frankly, I don't think I have it in me.<br/><br/>I appreciate what they did, but cannot qualify it a raving success overall. 5/10"
"shawnkenessey","5","1","4","19 May 2006"," A big fat dose of ""who cares...""
","{sarcasm}Wow, V bursts onto the scene with an impressive display of alliteration, clearly we should all bow down to his superior mind and delight in the mysteries of his astounding intellect for the duration of this movie....{/sarcasm} <br/><br/>I don't even know what this movie is really about. Melodramatic Shakespearean wannabees waxing philosophical about destroying the evil empire comes to mind... But the real point of this thing is lost in its over-wrought stylings that take the brilliant idea of revolution in all its forms, and dumb it down to something akin to fourth graders rioting on the playground.<br/><br/>Film in general is such a strange medium, it can be dominated by words, or dominated by slick imagery, either way it can still work as an enjoyable film. This movie on the other hand manages to have both too many words, and too much style. Not that it really has too much of either, its just such thoughtless superficial style and words. Its the stereotype of comic books, lots of pretty pictures, and lots of stupid words that add up to nothing. It's really no wonder that Allan Moore, an intelligent writer who is far above this kind of tripe, has completely disowned the movie version of his smartly written graphic novel.<br/><br/>In the end I don't think I really understood what the point of the movie was. I think its about revolution, but it comes across to me almost anti-revolution. For one it makes revolution into a form of revenge, and no true revolution is about revenge. Revolutions come from basic ideas concerning the human condition. There is no evidence of that in this movie. This movie turns revolution into a philosophical diatribe that would make the most angry anti-establishment types wince. Revolution is first and foremost, practical, particularly violent revolution, and trust me, nothing about this film is practical.<br/><br/>I really genuinely wonder why the hell filmmakers even bother basing movies on books. They rarely even try to stay true to the story, they always let their own egos mutate it into something that ultimately bears similarities in name and nothing else. STOP MAKING MOVIES ABOUT BOOKS YOU HAVE NO INTENTION OF EVEN REMOTELY FOLLOWING.<br/><br/>Aside from all those failings there are some cool action scenes. Say what you will about the action scenes they were superbly well done and pretty entertaining. The rest of it essentially worthless. It gets a five out of ten from me because at the very least most of what went on LOOKED nice."
"star-fish","5","1","4","17 May 2006"," V is not a Terrorist
","So the big problem with this film, politically, is not that V is a terrorist; it's that he isn't. As entertainment, it was enjoyable enough and I honestly enjoy the ""power to the people"" bit even if it is a bit overdone, but the attempts to mold the politics to those of today are dangerously flawed.<br/><br/>The storyline could have lent itself to a nuanced discussion of terrorism but this is not one. If they're trying to argue that terrorist acts are justified then they are not treating the issue honestly. If they are trying to argue that the distinction between what is and is not a terrorist act is fuzzy then they failed to add content to or clarify the debate. This is no Rand, Bradbury or Orwell.<br/><br/>Either the Wachowski brothers honestly think V is committing terrorist acts and are trying to create a sympathetic terrorist character, or the dishonest government is calling V a terrorist without justification (the latter is probably more in line with the graphic novel). If the latter is true, they do a poor job of communicating it. If the former is true, it's disingenuous because even if V's actions are morally questionable or objectionable, they are not equivalent to what we refer to as ""terrorist."" Innocent people die as a result of V's actions, but death is not the goal. The individuals he targets are power figures who knowingly acted in ways he finds reprehensible. Others who die are collateral. (There are also some police, which is a gray area, but they are trying to kill/apprehend him.) Whether ""collateral damage"" is acceptable is another debate, but there is a difference between casualties during an act where the intention is to capture a strategic target (e.g. a TV transmitter) or destroy a symbol, versus an act planned for the sole intention of killing or injuring non-combatants. V is not even as ""terrorist"" as his hero, Guy Fawkes. Fawkes targeted an occupied building at midday; V targets institutional buildings at midnight when they are vacant (a la Fight Club). Finally, the story addresses one's own government not intergroup warfare. I'm sure that a treatment of this subject could be done well; it's simply not done well here.<br/><br/>For a better treatment of government/police vs its citizens see ""La Haine"" 1995.<br/><br/>I am currently in the middle of the graphic novel and it seems to lack some of the logical problems of the film, largely because it is more vague and the title character less developed as a hero. On the other hand, it actually makes me appreciate some of the added plot points; in particular, Evey's character is much stronger and more developed, perhaps a sign of the times given that the novel was written more than twenty years ago."

","I admit that this is much better than most Hollywood films. But there were several major things wrong with it.<br/><br/>Why is V so good at martial arts and knife-throwing? No explanation was ever given. The only reason I can think of is that the Wachowski brothers (or the authors of the original comic-book) think that kind of thing is cool, and they couldn't bear to make a film without these kind of fighting scenes in. At the end he is hit by about five hundred bullets, and then gets up and says ""My turn"" and kills the soldiers with martial arts and knives - this was a stupid scene, and copied almost exactly from the end of The Matrix, where Keanu Reeves suddenly becomes able to stop bullets and then kills the Agents with martial arts (as I recall).<br/><br/>Why does he have a big house in the country - why is he so rich in general? This reminded me of nothing but Batman. This is a pity, as a lot of the film is supposed to be basically realistic or satirical, but him having a big house and being mysterious and rich is totally unrealistic and not satirical or clever at all. The only explanation I can think of is that it is a comic-book convention."

","V for Vendetta. Brilliant, powerful, and encompassing. This film will open your mind's eye and give you a glimpse into a scenario that could possibly materialize in the not to distant future. It is thought provoking and brilliantly scripted.<br/><br/>""V"" (Hugo Weaving) is the catalyst for the great ideals that seem to overcome the storyline of this movie. This film is very different in a good way, it is neither the story nor the characters that make this film great, it is the ideals that they are portraying. Some could say freedom many would say rebellion. Either way you look at it makes the viewer reflect onto their own lives and the government that is in power now, and question it.<br/><br/>The film utilizes a futuristic environment to show how the government has evolved over time to become a force that is accepted but not exactly wanted. The citizens of Britain are in many ways forced to accept the rule of the ""Chancellor"", played by John Hurt. With strict rules and regulations, the people are oppressed by their government thus making the actions of ""V"" and ""Evey"" (Natalie Portman) tremendously rebellious and to the mundane masses, fascinating.<br/><br/>History plays a major role in this film. ""Remember, Remember, the 5th of November"" is a line used to intensify the actions of ""V"" by incorporating an event in the past that also held significance as a catalyst for change. It makes the viewer realize that situations not unlike the one in ""V for Vendetta"" have occurred throughout time and that they will continue to occur. In many ways ""V"" commits acts of terrorism, but the twist to this film is that they are seen in a light of justice. Vengeance, defiance and revolution are all ideas that are accepted as good and taken on board as acts of liberty and are of utmost necessity for the freedom from oppression in this case.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" is a terrific film and is in my books one to remember. It can be seen from many different angles but the key is to keep an open mind. It is not the storyline that makes this movie; it is the hidden messages and thought provoking ideals. For those of us who think outside the square this is a film to be seen, for others I don't think would appreciate the intelligence nor vigor of this production. It makes the beauty of language and the ideas and actions of martyrs throughout history, reflected on in a different light. To sum up, this film goes against moral values and the ""hero"" is a stark contrast to what a hero ""should be"". It is an eye opener for sure. A film to be witnessed rather than seen. A brilliant production, go see it!"

The movie left me speechless for several minutes after the end titles...<br/><br/>The linguistic slipperiness of this movie at some points was astounding, and as i was watching it with foreign subtitles, at those times the subs just stopped appearing... <br/><br/>I found this movie to have something very much in common with The Matrix... a very possible, and very likely political future for not only England in this case but the whole world. We are indeed on the brink of destruction are we not? ... I found this movie to be a valid and valuable message to all who want to know whats happening around us in a general yet accurate picture.

V for Vendetta shows another beautiful display of action, scenic manipulation, creativity, philosophy, deep contemplation and other several things that seems to become a trademark of these talented brothers.<br/><br/>There's no even mystery behind the mask, everyone knows who's behind of it: The human being willing to be free from any social and political boundary. The reflexion of most of the characters pictures in the movie. V was merely the personification of those ideas. ""What's behind the mask...""

Do yourself a favour and go see V For Vendetta.<br/><br/>I have absolutely no idea why Alan Moore decided to distance himself from the film - its a well produced and slick film. The story chugs along nicely - at no point did I ever get the ""Oh, get on with it!"" problem that seems to occur a lot with films of this type. All the acting is of a good quality. Stephen Rea in particular plays his part well, with Stephen Fry a well-cast bonus in a cast that is predominantly British.<br/><br/>Symbolism features highly during the course of the film. During the course of the movie the symbols (or symbolic acts) become very important to the plot line itself. Many references are made to the world we live in today, which I believe is an excellent attempt to bring the viewer ""into"" the film. Parts of the film made me feel a little awkward (which is good!).... without giving too much away the visual representation of the Larkhill Camp I found particularly effective.<br/><br/>All in all everyone should give this movie a chance - I would think anyone who has seen Sin City would like this too."

The underlying political commentary never gets in the way of a weird but fantastic story that is told in such a sublime and refreshing manner. This is a story where you can truly identify with the characters, even the one where you never even see the face. This is a monumental performance by Hugo Weaving. His amazing voice that brings life to the central character has to be his best feat of acting to date. This is one difficult movie to describe, but the adage that you must see this movie has never been more appropriate. This is a sleeper hit that has rocketed to the list of my all-time great movies.

","In the near future, V is a terrorist in the eyes of a totalitarian regime in Great Britan. The movie begins on the night when V, on his way to blow up a UK landmark, meets Evey, (EV, get it?) Natalie Portman in a desperate situation. She's on the verge of being raped when V steps in to save her. Afterward, he brings her along to witness the orchestrated destruction of a UK landmark. <br/><br/>From there the move quickly degenerates into a series of admittedly gorgeous set pieces separated by plot holes and gaps in credibility. <br/><br/>The movie's biggest problem is that V is for inVincible. He can break into and escape from the most heavily guarded government buildings with ease. Encountering little resistance, he dispatches his enemies. There's little suspense when the hero can do anything and go anywhere and is never in serious danger.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with a bang but then grinds to a halt with a boring exposition on V's backstory (which is easily guessed at and straight out of comic book clichÃ© heaven).<br/><br/>The middle section of the movie is a laborious detective story inter spliced with V and Evey's relationship. The movie touches on big ideas but the audience is asked to make some huge leaps (even for a comic book movie) to believe the action in the story. <br/><br/>In an imagined series of scenes that encapsulate many of the movie's problems, Evey learns the story of a female victim of the regime. Though its heart is in the right place, the sequence is out of place and downright laughable.<br/><br/>There are good comic book hero movies out there. Don't bother with this one."
"Warsteel","4","1","4","9 April 2006"," Simply Awful
","Why this movie is given a rating of 8.2 is beyond me. V for vendetta is complete propaganda glorifying terrorism and once again assuring that world that religion is the downfall of the world. The moral of the story quite simply, ""if things don't go your way blow sh*t up."" What amazes me is that the movie actually attempts and does a good job portraying the terrorist as a smart and intelligent human being. I'm sorry but if blowing up parliament at the end of the movie wasn't terribly pointless I really don't know what is...

","V for Vendetta is set in a palpably morose not-too-distant future. Britannia rules the waves again; and America is spiraling down in waves of self destruction. England is in the clutches of a dentally challenged demagogue, the Supreme Chancellor, modeled after Hitler. Our protagonist (V), a latter day Guy Fawkes with issues, is a byproduct of government experiments, now hell bent on revenge. The masked avenger's strategy is to blow up government and quasi-government landmarks, with muzak playing in the background. Unlike your typical action/comics hero film that is mercifully free of reality, this confused attempt is weighed down by celluloid fetters of the overt, political kind. There is a veritable grocery list of broad, heavy handed references to a variety of themes including but not limited to the current war on terrorism, Abu Ghraib, Nazi experiments in concentration camps, homophobia, Dick Cheney and racism. The movie fails in generating our sympathy, and thus our continued interest, in any of the film's plethora of implausible and motiveless one-dimensional characters. Perhaps, one would sympathize with the man in the mask a tad bit more if he blew up ugly buildings for pure aesthetic reasons. The performances range from the unintentionally funny to high histrionics punctuated with dull hamming. The highlight of the movie was a scene, where the wigged wonder, now in an apron and humming tunes, makes Evey (played by Natalie Portman) a rather impoverished breakfast."

I really enjoyed (even though i didn't expect it, to be honest) the mind-blowing dialogs, along with the very good performances of both leading actors. watching this movie will introduce you to probably the most sophisticated and cultivated super anti-hero that exists in western comics.

","Finally got around to watching V for Vendetta. I was hoping and expecting to like it, but I certainly wasn't expecting to like it THIS much. I figured it would be just another action flick with some cool Matrix-ish imagery and stunts thrown in, but it was so much more...<br/><br/>Primarily, the subject matter it is dealing with is so close to controversial that it makes it an interesting study. The question being raised, is V a terrorist or a freedom fighter? And what's the difference between those two? The entire thing is dealt with, I think, brilliantly and fairly.<br/><br/>Then of course, there's the performances; Hugo Weaving is SPECTACULAR. Carrying the entire film with his face hidden behind the mask at all times... not an easy task, yet he breezes through it. I've never been too fond of Natalie Portman, but she really turned me around with this one. Kudos to her, I'm a stubborn sort not easily swayed.<br/><br/>The look and feel of the film were never really something to be worried about, coming from the stables of the Wachowski brothers.

Not to mention the awesome action scenes and the girls will like it too. Though the story is based on the DC comic it seemed fresh compared to the myriad of remakes coming out of Hollywood.

I should have waited for it to come out on DVD and just bought it! I really felt the issues that drove the movie's story line if not very close to what current events are now, really would provoke thought in regards to personal responsibility on letting governments gain control through fear.

Did our elected officials kill 3,000+ people in an effort to gain a better stranglehold on our personal freedoms? Were they getting a little trigger happy with the NSA wiretaps?

","I thought ""V for Vendetta"" was an eye-opening experience. People have said that the movie is just a platform for making terrorism look good, but I beg to differ. ""V""'s acts of terrorism are almost justified compared to what the movie's government did to him and others. ""V for Vendetta"" showed me that terrorism is an ideal, and one open to interpretation. To quote V himself: ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"". If you go see this movie, and I strongly suggest that you do, I beg you to do so with that epithet in mind, please. It doesn't necessarily point to any specific group and say that they are to blame. Rather, the movie tries to remind us that any government has the chance of becoming a dictatorship, and in the face of such a government, terrorism takes on a new meaning."
"plotlessviolence","4","1","4","5 April 2006"," Who Watches the Wachowskis?
","I liked this movie better when it was called Serenity, or Equilibrium, and had actual fight sequences instead of just one guy with knives who uses the ancient Chinese martial art of ""being fast."" Seriously, both those movies dealt with opposing a repressive totalitarian government (albeit with better plots) WITHOUT CONDONING TERRORISM.<br/><br/>Let it be known Alan Moore has disavowed any connection with this movie. I haven't read the comic book version of V for Vendetta, but his other work The Watchmen is the greatest graphic novel of all time, and I saw how the intended script for that movie totally destroyed Moore's brilliant writing and plot.<br/><br/>We've all seen totalitarian dystopia movies, especially those resembling or based on comic books, a million times before. Heck, that's the only form of government comic book authors seem to recognize. V for Vendetta is tolerably acted, and Hugo Weaving's voice is perfect for the role, but the story as portrayed is far too simplistic and comes across as simple Bush-bashing without any of the comedy or action sequences that would otherwise make simple plot movies enjoyable.<br/><br/>Then there's the whole condoning terrorism dealie. It isn't just that V is a (n intended) sympathetic anarchist, the problem is that V ISN'T a real terrorist but will be identified as such. Real terrorists target and murder innocent civilians for the purpose of effecting political change. All V ever does is pursue a personal vendetta against 4 specific targets who have done him (and thousands more) wrong in the past and thus deserve to be murdered. The only time he hurts innocents is when he threatens to blow up a government-controlled propaganda news station with what appears to be a fake bomb, and thereby holds 10 innocents hostage for a movie time of 10 seconds (a crime that's never really examined). But by equating the far less evil V with real terrorists, V for Vendetta is making a (n unfair) pro-terrorism argument no matter what the stars say in press releases.<br/><br/>Nor does the movie ever show any of the real consequences of anarchy. For all the chaos V causes, the worst ever attributed to him is that a criminal holds up a grocery wearing one of his masks (but no one is hurt). The building destroyed at the end is unoccupied (apparently), and we're expected to believe that the UK somehow reconstitutes itself without a single loss of innocent life after every all the important government members are dead.<br/><br/>The movie makes the argument that there's an either/or choice between Anarchy and Totalitarianism. V has hard evidence of the key government members' many crimes, but when he gets his chance to take over the news, all he does is threaten people. Why didn't he just broadcast his evidence? I guess the real answer is that Hollywood is still sore Iraq. Well, fine, but toss in some kung fu scenes or SOMETHING."

I'll try of course...: It was a very complete experience. It had all the elements, or at least all the RIGHT elements. When I first decided I wanted to see this film, I knew very little about it, but I put my faith in two facts : Natalie and the Wachowski brothers ! <br/><br/>I knew (!) this was going to be a sci-fi action movie with a good story, great effects, great acting and likely a few surprises, but what I got was SO much more ! Before I went in I was wondering if the film and the story would actually TOUCH me at the emotional level. How DEEP would it be ? Well, it was DEEP ! I could actually FEEL what Evey was going through, since Natalie Portmans acting was so convincing that I completely forgot and/or ignored that she was speaking with a British English accent. I was there with her, living it through her, and it gave me both thrills, scares, joys, tears and goosebumps from start to finish ! She is nothing short of brilliant in this movie, worthy of an Oscar for sure, and I'm NOT just saying that because I'm a big fan of hers...!<br/><br/>The last touch to this film is the dialogue. It's genius ! Intelligent and well chosen for this type of film. Big words and long sentences that SOME people might find a bit on the heavy side, and possibly a little hard to understand if English is not your first language, but it works ! It's used mainly by V when he on several occasions tries to make us (Evey) understand the point of it all, without telling her too much at a time. And being a KIND of a ""wanna-be"" Shakespearean character it's very cool that he quotes Shakespeare from time to time, and of course always on the RIGHT occasions. Only very few other actors could pull that off, and make us believe it, but Hugo Weaving does it very well indeed.<br/><br/>Personally I don't think I've seen a more complete movie since ""LEON - the Professional"" (My all-time favorite!). It gave me the feeling of having been part of something really special, and in my experience not many movies can give a person that feeling ! Is it a coincidence that Natalie Portman stars in both ""V for Vendetta"" and ""LEON"", you ask ? Do yourself a favor : If for no other reason, at least go see this movie to find out just HOW good she is ! I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed !"

It was a fresh and sophisticated terror against tyranny and totalitarianism, and it came as even more surprise under the Bush government, however, it became clear that why this movie is so successful and popular in time of Bush.<br/><br/>All the metaphors in the movies are working as paradoxes at the same time as its metaphors. The mask of hero and disfigured face underneath is our pressed state of mind, never can be expressed under the current map of politics, however, our rage can be expressed under the mask as it is breaking the rules of our identity, which can be easily targeted and traced by government anytime. As a stamp on your forehead, as same as barcode on your ID card, you will never get out of control under the multiple digit numbers. You are no more important than those digit numbers given and you are no longer free of anything against the law set by government, when you rebel or revolt, you are becoming an enemy instantly. At the end of the movie, we see people are wearing masks to hide their own identities when they join the riot and they could remove the masks as it lost meanings when they achieved their freedom again.<br/><br/>They targeted 'homosexual' people as a target of the government, which means that minor groups - who decide to be live as own identity in the society became unnecessary tumors for system and it need to be omitted for sustaining it.<br/><br/>It has so many glorious moments as entertainment goes as it is based on graphic novel, so you should expect few exaggerated graphical elements in the movie, however, it is modern cinematic opera as its peak. Not so brilliant but intelligent enough to set a new standard in Hollywood movie, and it is possible to fill seats as its big budget movie's mega scale. However, the hero dies in the film, so you are not going to expect it will be those meaningless sequels, unless Natalie Portman becomes Riefley in Aliens movie, I don't see that coming personally.<br/><br/>When Big Ben was blowing up on the screen, you could almost burst into tears as it provide climax at utmost. This is a must see movie and you don't have to feel guilty by walking into the megaplex by chasing Hollywood release, you will be satisfied as much you walked into bureaucratic art house movie.<br/><br/>Another stunning thing about movie is that Natalie Portman deliver almost near perfect British accent and it becomes so frantic surprise when you perhaps knows she's French and she was a little girl in the French film called ""Leon"". ""Not sure it's English title, something was very stupid as some kind of cocky and dumb translation as 'Killer' but don't count on me as I don't care, really.<br/><br/>As I am reading 'Trial' by Kafka at the moment, it came as 'coincidence' as its surprise. It's so contradiction as in the movie, the ""V' state that he's not believed in coincidence. However, this movie will lift you up as much as terror to your brain if your brain is not so flathead as much as scumbag.<br/><br/>I found it so irony that they are showing the preview of 'scary movie 4' before the movie that I found so hilarious to imagine the promoter apply same demographics in the same category with this movie. I found it so refreshing and certainly we're living in the neutron age, you can't never be sure what you are clash into. Just need to hit then you'll see where you are just break into.<br/><br/>Well, I might as tired as a victim of flathead people who bashes me everyday with their butthead perception, but it was so much pleasure to see there are people out there still can really know what people need to be educated. This movie it was certainly one of them, will blow your brain out, you folks."

","There is a good movie in there somewhere, but it is buried in a pile of Wachowski saccharine and phoniness. The pace is wrong, the dialogues are bad, and the movie is 1 hour too long. Alan Moore's comic, on which the movie is based, was a 1980s story inspired by Thatcher's Britain. The Wachowski brothers replace the original anarchist ethos with Twin Tower conspiracies theories and references to the Kuran in an attempts to make it relevant to the 21st century, but ultimately they fail. Despite the fact they did their homework about London and casted some British actors, the movie still felt phony. Even the special effects are nothing to blow your mind. Explosions look like firework displays, and zoomed in falling raindrops have been done in many shampoo adverts before. The only eye candy I enjoyed was some flying knives at the very end. Once again, the Wachowski brothers proved they can only do crap movies. Stay well away from it."
"setzerman","Null","1","4","29 March 2006"," Imperfect Masterpiece
","This is not a typical comic book to big screen adaptation movie, though I realize that I wrote something similar for ""Batman Begins"". The fact is that the action in this movie takes a back seat to the political message, which is blunt and to-the-point. Most of the stunts, effects are instruments of this message, and thankfully the budget was not spent there. It is conceivable that fans of current right-wing governments may totally disagree with the value of this message. Regardless, they will no doubt acknowledge that McTeigue has crossed the line and stepped where no man has gone before (not Uranus), at least this side of 9/11. He and his team must be commended for this courageous stand.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is totally unbalanced, facing Hugo Weaving's now-legendary heart-wrenching tirades and one-liners, is Nathalie Portman, who seems to be in a hurry to cash her paycheck. Watching her on-screen, one cannot help but wonder if she did not feel that considering she was sacrificing her hair for the movie, she should not be asked for much more. I was disappointed because I really like her ""attributes"", prior work and genuine personality when interviewed. Having said that, the good news is that the movie was well-crafted around this disastrous Paula Abdul-style performance to minimize negative effect on the movie. Hey, Star Wars still became Star Wars, despite Mark Hamill, right? so who knows.<br/><br/>This movie is in addition beautiful in terms of cinematography, and one will definitely miss a lot by watching it on a TV screen. Watch it at the theaters, then buy the DVD, to drown the inevitable sorrows resulting from George W.'s next two years in office.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman (Evey) - 3/10 - Terrible. Though less terrible in the part of the movie where she is bald.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving (V/William Rookwood) - 9/10 - Only downer is not being able to watch his clenching teeth as he delivers his Shakespeare.<br/><br/>James McTeigue - 9/10 - Impressively manages to deliver a great movie, despite being handicapped with an absent lead actress."
"djonikaitis","4","1","4","27 March 2006"," Remember, remember...
","... The 5th of November. I am not sure how to start this review, but at least this phrase (Remember,remember...) kick-starts the movie perfectly. Movie starts with images of execution of a man Guy Fawkes, an English soldier, one of the men behind the Gunpowder plot in 1605, when there had been plans to blast Westminster palace Fawkes was executed (we have an opportunity to see this, but we have an opportunity to question necessity of this as well), four hundred years have passed, but the message is clear - man was an idea, and this idea survives - the fight for freedom is higher then personal ""I"". Movie is set sometime in the mid of the 21st century, in a Britain ruled by dictator who looks like Hitler (John Hurt) and his loyal fellowship of followers, who can converse with him via video-conferencing only (I think this perfectly shows the insecurity of a country, where security is implemented by curfews and arrests). The 5th of November reference is given a clear role. There is a man with code name V (Hugo Weaving), a fighter for freedom and, and who promises to blow houses of Parlament no other day, but on November 5th. Based on the graphic novel, movie posits great idea but apart from this there is not much more to say. We do get obligatory recourses to the past to justify everything happening now. We do get few buildings blown apart. Some dialogs worth condemnation and even some poetry (Remember, remember...). We have love interest for V (Natalie Portman as Evey) who will have her part to play. We do have everything, what we have seen hundreds times of before. And yes, we know that the movie is about government control, fighting for ideals, idea standing above individual needs, but one could be left pondering, whether idea alone can make movie good. When all is said and done, there is nothing to remember about it. Maybe only the rhyme which so perfectly kick-starts the movie. 5/10 or C+, I suppose."

"God-12","8","1","4","26 March 2006"," Anti-fascism romp
","This is a most enjoyable re-hash of the '1984'. One of my long time heroes, good old Guy Fawkes gets a fitting memorial - though, as a point of accuracy, he wasn't hanged, he was hanged, drawn and quartered.<br/><br/>The film does have some other problems with accuracy. The descent into fascism, seen in the UK, has been a major part of Phony Tony's control-freakery and the New 'error of judgement' Labour puritanism - the film, at one stage, appears to suggest that such fascism might arise out of a Conservative government, the proof is, of course, in the pudding - ID Cards, trying to get rid of trial by jury, abolishing constitutional checks, running the government with a group of low-life cronies rather than parliament etc. etc.. Still, they probably couldn't have got the funding if they'd made the truth plain!<br/><br/>The film echoes some scenes from Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' very well - but the music is, of course, much better. The 1812 finale is quite magnificent, a scene of great delight, the sooner life follows art in that regard the better!<br/><br/>It is a nicely stylistic film, also literate in its references - if a bit self-consciously so, in a sort of sixth-formish manner.<br/><br/>It knocks the pants of the portrayal of Capote as a piece of entertainment. Also, unlike Capote, you can hear every word, which makes a film so much less self-indulgent.<br/><br/>One of the humorous vignettes was Stephen Fry admitting that, well, yes, he might be a bit of a pansy if you put it that way - beautifully done!<br/><br/>It should be required viewing for anybody who hasn't seen the picture of the way in which New 'error of judgement' Labour has screwed the country.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, and the bits about dealing harshly with the ex-colonies is very funny."

The Field starring Richard Harris, JFK ( as I was puzzled by the plot--the movie more than the assassination) and finally V for Vendetta. This is a wonderful film. It is all at once political, romantic, thriller, tragedy, comedy. I cannot speak highly enough. The pace of the film is perfect. It never once let me go. From a stirring opening it just gets better and better . The casting is spot on.

"weberzj","8","1","4","25 March 2006"," Fighting Terror with Terror
","Definitely an entertaining movie, with a spectacular performance by Natalie Portman. Intriguing plot that slowly reveals the mystery behind the character of ""V"" throughout the movie. It begins with a bang and kept my attention throughout. A good mix of action (fires, explosions, and knife fighting!) and suspense, with many conspiracy-laced subplots. My only reservation was the general message that the movie sent. Granted, the government in this film is a reflection of the Nazi-ruled Germany but (without giving too much away) it seems that terrorism is help up as an appropriate solution to the problem and ultimately one that gives freedom and hope to the masses. I know it's just a movie, but it left me with an uneasy feeling that someone might leave the theater with a few new ideas about how to solve the tensions that exist between a man and his government."
"mabowle","8","1","4","24 March 2006"," Well-Made but Standard Action Movie
","The Wachowski brothers seem to have a weakness for action movies trying to convey some form of philosophy. Unfortunately, in my eyes they totally lost all credibility, when they set out on their nauseating commerce spree with their Matrix trilogy. Basically they joined sides with the ""big bad machine"", trying to squeeze every last single cent out of the people that saw anything good or interesting in their movies.<br/><br/>For this reason I tend to just plainly ignore any form of ""message"" they would try to get across with this flick, preferring to draw my inspirations, philosophical ideas, ethics, etc from other sources, other than mainstream cinema.<br/><br/>So, under the hood, this is just a standard (almost)lone-hero-against-an-evil-world action movie, which is apart from some lengths well made though. Just like the above mentioned trilogy it sports some nice stunts and special effects (the knife throwing scenes near the end and the domino scene were awesome). Imagery as in choice of colors and light/shadow as well as the music are well-chosen, so I can definitely see some talent."

"theLPgoonie","10","1","4","23 March 2006"," V is the new 1984
","V for vendetta is more than just your new attempt at a unique view of dictation from the Wachowski brothers. It is a stroke of comic genius brought to life.<br/><br/>Set in the near future, we see a world that has been ruined by war, plague, and political corruption. The scene is London, where there is a high chancellor in power of the country of England. 'Strength in unity, unity in faith'. The motto of the regime. A complete totalitarian view of ruling a country, fueled only by the fear of its people.<br/><br/>Along comes a man named v. a freedom fighter to some, a terrorist to others, and he is here to show us that people shouldn't be afraid of their governments, but governments should be afraid of their people.<br/><br/>Albeit, there isn't as much action as the trailers would leave you to believe, it is the parts in the middle that make this film amazing. The dialogue that transpires, and the graphic tale of corruption that is told is almost epic. We come to see how a government can spiral out of control, and that one of the scariest things can be the government attacking its own people.<br/><br/>Long forgotten was the failed destruction of parliament, by a man named Guy Fawkes, we see V taking on this image of not a man in a mask, but the symbol of an idea. just as parliament is a symbol of London, it was only made so by the power of the people, as V reminds us, and as such, blowing up parliament, with enough people, can mean the exact same. It can create unity that this country needs.<br/><br/>As you go through the movie, not only are issues of an overly oppressive government attacked, issues such as gay/lesbian rights are dealt with. As well as the freedom of speech and censorship.<br/><br/>And as the transformation of the main character Evey Hammond, Natalie Portman, evolves into the patriot she becomes at the end of the film, we go through a transformation ourselves. We are reminded of the world we live in today and what we are fed to expect and relinquishing our free will without a fight instead of standing up for an idea that is proper and right.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's acting in this feature was simply perfection. The events that shape her life in this movie are uncanny, and would tear a normal person apart, but she finds a way to work through it all. And when she is trapped in a prison, being tortured day in and day out, she is finally set free to feel the rain on her face once again. Well, it's very powerful, and it's very moving...<br/><br/>Beyond the emotional roller-coaster that this film can send you through, there are sparks of comedy and action as well. If you don't laugh at the terrorist V flipping eggs for morning breakfast while standing around in an apron, then I don't know what's wrong with you. And if you don't find the special effects on the destruction of Big Ben astounding, then you should be smacked.<br/><br/>Furthermore, some of the fights scenes were V uses his knives are flat-out unbelievable. Yeah, they use 'cheesy slow-mo' as some might complain about, but I beg to differ. I find the slow-mo completely necessary to appreciate the amazing speed at which V moves, and to showcase exactly what he did. Just is the case in which his knives leave a slight glow behind them. And as for an unbelievable amount of blood, which has also been pointed out in reviews. It's a comic book movie. You'll learn to deal, but you will also note that most of the places along the body that were sliced apart were major arteries which would have a ton of blood in them.<br/><br/>And at the end, as V seems he should've died after being pelted with tons of bullets, you can see the underlying true meaning to the film.<br/><br/>Hope is everything. And all you need is the will to go on, and you can. Death can wait for that one thing that is more important than life itself, and that is an idea. For something better. And all it takes is the will to live, and the will to fight to keep that hope alive just a little bit more.<br/><br/>I think this movie is amazing, and I say right now, that even by the end of the year, this will be one of the best films of 2006, and I seriously hope Natalie Portman gets some consideration for an Oscar nod for Best Actress in a Leading Role, because she was amazing. I've seen this film now 3 times already, no joke. I hope you all can find the time to see it at least once, because it is worth your time.<br/><br/>And I leave you with the best quote in the film: V: beneath this mask there is more than flesh. There is an idea, Mr. Creedy, and ideas are bulletproof."
"max-vernon","10","1","4","23 March 2006"," An uncomfortable message for our terror-embattled democracy.
","This is an art-house film disguised as a comic action-flick. Its trailer belies the film's serious subject matter. Stylistically it is wonderful. It should become a cult classic.<br/><br/>'V' offers an insight into fascism  how it uses fear to get power and keep power. There are clear parallels with Nazi Germany. For fear of Communism, substitute fear of terrorism, gays and 'godlessness'. For Antisemitism, substitute Islamophobia. For the Reichstag Fire, substitute 'deadly virus'  but in this case, the 'Nazis' really do 'set fire to the Reichstag'. For Dachau, substitute Larkwood detention centre where 'worthless human material' is subjected to scientific experiment. For Hitler/Goebbels/Himmler, substitute an all-powerful 'High Chancellor' (John Hurt) supported by censored TV and biometric surveillance systems and Fingermen enforcing nightly curfews. For 1937 Exhibition of Degenerate Art, substitute the private and illegal collection (including a banned Koran) of the Stephen Fry character. For Gleichschaltung, substitute Reclamation. For collusion between Nazis and big business, substitute a drug company tsar who makes millions out of its antidote to the deadly virus. For Night of the Long Knives Nazi back-stabbing, substitute the betrayal of the High Chancellor. This film could become a teaching aid to understanding Nazi Germany!! <br/><br/>'V' is the heroic individual who challenges this totalitarian nightmare. Using the 400th anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot was a brilliant iconic device on which to hang the 'cloak of resistance'.<br/><br/>Critics have questioned this use of Guy Fawkes as an icon of resistance to tyranny, pointing out that he wanted Catholic theocracy, not freedom. This misses the point. Fawkes targeted a Protestant elite which he saw as an oppressive tyranny ruling over a benighted island. He was not an indiscriminate bomber, but was engaged in an act of tyrannicide recently endorsed by the Jesuits.<br/><br/>It is a cultural challenge for British people to accept GF as an icon for heroic resistance to tyranny. The British have been burning GF in effigy every year for the last four centuries. Our Catholic-fearing culture has cast him as the archetypal villain. Bonfire Night is the only genuinely popular national festival that we have. British children used to stuff old clothes with newspaper, purchase a cheap Guy Fawkes mask for a face and beg 'penny for the guy' in the street in order to get fireworks money for Bonfire Night. They now engage in Trick or Treat (Globalisation = Americanisation).<br/><br/>The 'V' character targets buildings, not ordinary people. His bombings are a rallying call for Londoners to rise up and overthrow the dictatorship. Watching the Houses of Parliament blow up at the end of the film was for me a very moving and cathartic experience as well as a theatrical masterpiece. It was as symbolic as the Fall of the Bastille. The Legislative House has lost control of the Executive and pays a just price! The people have risen and overthrown tyranny! Rejoice! <br/><br/>V is really into tyrannicide rather than terrorism: his personal vendetta is directed at the leading perpetrators who have scarred his life. He is very much in the tradition of Georg Elser and the July Plotters who almost killed Hitler. Were they heroes or traitors, freedom-fighters or terrorists? Does V's aim justify his means? The audience is forced to confront these serious matters. Viewers may feel uncomfortable about terrorism and bombings in our terror-ridden times - underlined by the film's delayed release following the 7/7 carnage. The use of an underground train to deliver the final blow was an unfortunate coincidence which the filmmakers could not have predicted. It will resonate badly with many Londoners.<br/><br/>Both the 'V' and Natalie Portman characters are played wonderfully and an intelligent script gives them the opportunity to develop both character and storyline. Their relationship is carefully crafted. He is the teacher, she the non-political citizen who is sucked into his subversive enterprise. The awful effect of fascism on individuals is illustrated by several story lines and flashbacks, skilfully and poignantly told. What happens to the Stephen Fry character when he bucks the system is unnervingly accurate! The dialogue explores both the motivation for violent political action and also its corrupting potential. It gets quite deep in parts, with quotes from Shakespeare.<br/><br/>Orwell wrote '1984' in 1948, not as a future prediction but as a critique of Stalinist Russia. This film is a political fantasy and does not seriously aim to project present 2005 trends up to the year 2020. It alludes to the Nazi era and fascistic tendencies in any modern society. The idea of a resurgent, 'fascistic' Christianity casting Muslims and gays into the abyss does not reflect the realities of modern-day Britain, merely the dreams of a few British fascists. Paradoxically, at this moment in time, it applies more to the USA which the film portrays as 'godless'. Fundamentalism, homophobia, racism and Islamophobia are more in evidence in that society  witness the recent Congressional paranoia over a Dubai-based firm acquiring US ports, resistance to gay marriage and abortion and the continuing 'freedom' to be racist! <br/><br/>ETA has finally ended its terror campaign against the Spanish state. ETA's rationale for its terrorism disappeared long ago - 'Up, Up, with Franco! Up, Up, like Carrero Blanco!' Did it ever have a rationale, even in the darkest days of fascism? ETA targeted leaders and functionaries of the Spanish state, rather like Guy Fawkes and 'V' and Stauffenberg's bomb. Is violent political resistance ever justified? The film answers this moral dilemma with a resounding 'yes'. This is an uncomfortable message in our terror-embattled democracy. The film does not endorse indiscriminate terrorism but it does endorse tyrannicide.<br/><br/>This is a well-crafted film which is both profound and entertaining. It is full of historical allusions. Remember, remember, this is a political fantasy film which is grounded in historical realities. 'V for Vendetta' enlightens in an entertaining way. I've seen it twice. It was even better the second time around."

","Title: V for Vendetta <br/><br/>Director: James McTeigue <br/><br/>Cast: Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, John Hurt, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry <br/><br/>Review: The Warchowski Brothers decided to follow up the success of their Matrix films with a movie based on DC Comics V for Vendetta, a graphic novel written by Alan Moore. This time they are on board not as directors, but as producers and writers. The chore of directing this film fell upon first time director James McTiegue who worked with the Warchowskis as second unit director on the Matrix films. Did they do justices to Alan Moores book? Or was Alan Moores creation once again raped and mutilated like A League of Extraordinary Gentlemen? Is the movie any good? <br/><br/>The story is about a not to distant future (think 20 years ahead into the future) in which there is an oppressive government. The leader is a Hitler like politician who goes by the name of Adam Sutler. Sutler is very fond of lying to the public and hiding the truth behind his actions and his screw ups. Sound familiar don't it? Anyhows in this future a rebel emerges who is very aggressively going against this government and decides to organize and army to send a message to the powers that be. His mission? To get people to awaken from their slumber, stop watching their TV sets filled with lies and start taken a stance for what they should believe in.<br/><br/>Ill tell you something this movie has got some balls. The political climate in the world of V for Vendetta and the one we are currently living in isn't so different. There's lying politicians telling people what they want people to know. Not the truth. And people believe everything that is given to them through their TV sets. Not that we weren't aware of all the bullcrap that is being fed to us through our TV sets, but this film really works as a wake up call to people. The future of this film is not too distant, therefore we can more readily identify with the film. So when V tells the people of England ""You have only to blame yourselves"" it really hits you like a ton of bricks! V for Vendetta is a film yeah, but its one that has a powerful resounding message that shouldn't be taken lightly. One that the Warchowskis brothers are making sure that you hear loud and clear. Some of the dialog and situations made me think, damn this movie sure isn't afraid to say what it means! Is it faithful to the comics that its based on? I honestly don't know since I haven't really read Moores novel. I've read some reviews that say that yes, it sticks pretty close to the graphic novel and its faithful to the material. But aside from that, I think the film really works and I think it really archives what its trying to do. Which is in fact get people to think and not just stay in a state of numbness where you don't care whats going on with your country. The best line in the movie says it all: ""People shouldn't fear their governments, Goverments should fear their people"".<br/><br/>Those of you expecting a big action extravaganza with many special effects sequences will be greatly disappointed since this is a film that focuses more on the themes and drama then gee weez effects sequences. Yes it's a film based on a comic book, but don't expect batman/spider-man like action. Though the movie does remind you every now and then that it is a comic book movie with some action, like for example its batman influenced opening sequence with V rescuing Evey from a couple of thugs, but for the most part, this movie is a film not aimed at selling action figures or gimmicks at your local Burger King. It's a serious film, aimed to make you think. It does have a few action sequences (I counted about three) and they are excellent, but they are not the center of this film. This movie is asking you to analyze what its trying to say and then really feel it. There's a really heartwarming sequence with Portman locked up in a jail cell that should really get you thinking about the central theme of the movie.<br/><br/>Everyones performance was excellent, but of noteworthy importance was Portmans portrayal of Evey, V's love interest. She has some intense sequences that show her total devotion in what she believes in. Hugo Weaving as V is great. He doesn't show his face through out the whole film but does an incredible performance as V. His voice and his body language make V become a great character. Its kind of ironic to see John Hurt playing the evil oppressing ""big brother"" politician in this film, since Hurt played the oppressed character, Winston Smith in the film adaptation of George Orwells 1984.<br/><br/>Also I need to put my hat down to the Warchowsky brothers because they wrote an excellent screenplay, with some intelligent dialog, of course they had Moores book to draw from, but they did a great job in putting forth an important and relevant message.<br/><br/>In conclusion get ready for a movie that matters. There have been sci-fi movies in the past giving their message of the people rebelling against an oppressive government. A few films pop to mind like 1984, Equilibrium...but in all honesty, non have done it with such a sure and resounding voice as V for Vendetta did. A movie that talks about things that hit all too close to home and the times that we are living in. Get ready for V.<br/><br/>Rating: 5 out of 5"
"Kamofo","10","1","4","23 March 2006"," Spectacular
","Hugo Weaving's articulate speech were enough to pull this movie off. But the addition of amazing knife-flying scenes, wonderful music, and theatrical dialogue made it all the merrier! The plot was simply astonishing and the way the Wachowski brothers pulled it together was simply amazing. There is really nothing more that needs to be said but since I'm required to make a 10-line comment I suppose I will do so. Weaving pulls of V like nothing I could ever imagine. Alongside him in greatness was Natalie Portman with another terrific performance, she was vivacious, full of virility, vindictive, I could probably try to find fitting ""V"" words forever, but V himself seems to be a lot better at it--she was simply amazing, not to mention gorgeous as usual. If I say much more I'm afraid I'll give away spoilers and I'd much rather post a spoiler-free comment. Great movie, go see it today!"

I would say this is one of the best movies in years. Not only does it have amazing special effects but it has a wonderful story to go along with it. And it's message is one that makes perfect sense. ""Remember remember the fifth of November the gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot."" And don't forget ""People shouldn't fear their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."" It is an absolutely amazing movie and I recommend that everyone see it."

","I was particularly impressed with Hugo Weaving's ability to express emotion through movement and voice only, without facial expression. I guess this is an extension of his stoic presentation in the Matrix trilogy. Natalie Portman got stronger and more believable as the movie went on, without becoming a Linda Hamilton in Terminator character. More like Sigorney Weaver in Alien.<br/><br/>I thought that the movie was as visually stunning as the plot was complex. With all of the subtle story lines and inside historical references, the visuals could have easily overwhelmed the storyline, but it didn't. Did you notice that much of the story takes place inside and in unlit areas but we don't have to squint to see what is happening.<br/><br/>A question though - is this sci-fi or drama?"

","I am not familiar with the source material, but I must say that I loved this film. It is amazingly thought-provoking, with some very depressing parallels to current situations.<br/><br/>I discovered from the credits that Hugo Weaving did V. He is, of course, a terrific actor; but I was wondering if we were going to have a ""Darth Vader"" situation where one actor does the voice and another the physical movement.<br/><br/>I can't give the film a 10/10 because there were some serious questions: for example, was the final fit of special effects actually necessary, or just a bit of decorative iconoclasm? And I also question the likelihood of V putting the heroine through the rigors depicted in the middle of the film.<br/><br/>However, despite the fact that the film has some rather spectacular killings, I never found the film to be gory or gruesome, and I thought the smiling Guy Fawkes mask was a perfect touch--no matter how dreadful the subject, or tearful the scene, V would be smilin' thru. However, I am eternally grateful (and consider this a spoiler) that we had no Phantom Of The Opera unmasking scene. I must confess that a good portion of the tension for me was whether the heroine was about to snatch the mask. But the viewer is allowed to use his or her imagination, which I think serves much better than any make-up might have. <br/><br/>A film that is well-made, entertaining AND thought-provoking is a rare occurrence. Savor it."
"90seconds","7","1","4","21 March 2006"," V for Vendetta offers solid entertainment, but it's not the comic book
","This is a very entertaining film. Set in a post-apocalyptic fascist Britain, V for Vendetta offers solid entertainment only undermined by a moralistic didacticism that fails in a number of ways.<br/><br/>It is impossible to mention this movie without mentioning the seminal comic book, written by the infamous Alan Moore, and illustrated by David Lloyd. I, like countless other comic fans, am in complete awe of Alan Moore's career. After numerous attempts to make his comics into films, with varying degrees of failure, V for Vendetta has been lauded by the comic community as finally doing the original justice. <br/><br/>The movie does get a lot right. The pacing, with it's rhythmic procession of action, horrific subtext, set-up, and action is great. The cinematography, with matrix flourishes, and nods to the original illustrations; editing that remains by and large seamless, and the scale, are all quite satisfying. Where the movie fails is when it comes to any semblance of a message. Where the comic book is an erudite knee-jerk reaction to the Reagan/Thatcher administration, the film has been modernized only by a few not-so-subtle jabs at the Bush administration that really de-contextualize the story. <br/><br/>I shouldn't gripe about what the movie missed from the comic, but it's important in order to differentiate between the brilliant, but flawed comic, and the blockbuster film. An effectively written psychedelic voyage that Finch undertakes to discover V, all the political sub-plots that humanized and offered sympathetic understanding to the villainous politicians, and the narrative juxtaposition of technology and justice being impartial to misuse, are but some of the golden gems cut from the movie in order for it to work on the screen. Unfortunately, the story still has too much ground to cover, and most of the movie comes out of someone's mouth, while the visuals struggle to catch up. <br/><br/>The acting is an unfortunate casualty of poor translation from the comic book. Portman was a poor choice for Evey. The talented ensemble of British actors who make up the villains really have no material to work with, and subsequently have no character arcs, and are a constant irritating villainous 'other' throughout the film. Hugo Weaving does actually do V justice, despite the comic book character's characterization being in part based on the fact you could only imagine his voice. <br/><br/>I readily admit this film is marred for me because of my engagement with the comic book. There are many good points to the film, despite my disparaging comments, and it is way above par for both a directorial debut, and for a blockbuster. I was constantly disappointed with scenes, not for what they were, but for what they weren't, lacking the clever reflexivity and mind blowing insight of the comic. Numerous scenes in the movie tried very hard to convey the extreme conditions which characters (and the audience) are supposed to intellectually evolve through, and they don't work. In the end, while the spirit of V and Evey are kept intact, the rest of the cast are painted with very large caricature brush-strokes which really undermine the subtleties of any political message that the director must have been drawn to. The end product has too much of an aftertaste of a more accessible, better made 'Ultraviolet' for my liking."
"TawneyShea","10","1","4","21 March 2006"," The Movie was Brilliant
","The movie was better than most movies I have seen. You don't even have to read the graphics novels to understand anything either. It has thought behind it and it kept you informed. It was pretty much an allegory to what could happen if we stay on this track but I just watched it and thought about the relationship that Evey and V were having. It was a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>The action scenes were intense and nothing was confusing at all. I mean I am 18 if I can understand what is going on, you can too. All the elements were there and it wasn't one of those movies that you go to and leave feeling like there could have been more or you wish there was a sequel. If there was a sequel I would see it but what they left you with was all you needed. I would definitely recommend this movie to those who like thought and/or those who like action movies."

","This is a must see. Totally fresh, and very well done. Not only is the film unified through an aesthetic, it also contains just the right mix for a flavorful romance, action thriller. Natalie Portman is so hot, and she does wonderfully in the acting. The Watchowski Brothers really did it this time, I think that this is their best production yet. Matrix was awesome, but V is definitely more balanced. V is definitely a sexy connoisseur who is very witty, and sick with knives. He tells it like it is. The film has a wonderful blend of politics, psycology, and female gender roles in society. The future world of brittain was illustrated very neo Gothic, I liked everything about it. This is definitely a cyberpunk must. I think V for Vendetta will be one of the greats for this decade. go out and see it while its still on those big screen! It is something I will definitely have for my blip of existence. You won't forget this movie. grab your mate, and watch it. do it...no no... DO IT.<br/><br/>-don."

","I went into the movie not expecting much. I went in with the knowledge that it was a comic book, but it looked fairly good. I went into the movie hoping that it wouldn't be a waist of money. By the time I came out I was like a giddy little school child. It has been a long time sense I have seen a movie that made me stand up and praise it for being done so well. The acting in it was superb, the visuals were astounding, and the action was all there. It was a movie that challenged you to think but still had an explosive plot. There is a lot of symbolism in the movie, and no matter how big and how small it is it helps the movie along. It is an awesome picture and would suggest it as a must see to anyone."
"elandyll","10","1","4","21 March 2006"," Beyond the adaptation of Alan Moore's Comic, an Amazing piece of Cinematography
","Adapted from the homonymous comic from the genius Alan Moore (also author of the ""Watchmen"", which is also to be ported to screen if memory serves), V for Vendetta has met and went beyond my hopes both as an entertainment piece, and a true film in all the meanings that count.<br/><br/>In a not so future post Apocalyptic world, with the setting based in England -and more specifically London-, the story focuses on two characters upon which the fate of all England, and maybe more, will be decided. We are told that following a civil war in the US, and an atrocious terrorist attack with Bio-Chemical weapons which ended up killing more than 100.000 innocents, a Dictatorship is now present in England. Chancelor Sutler, helped by a ""shadow council"", akin to a new Hitler or Mussolini, rules with a fist of iron -without the eponymic glove- and uses very expeditive and violent means to ""purge"" England from what is undesired. From Homosexuals to political opposition, the parallel to WWII is clear. But let us go back to the movie, after an enigmatic line is delivered to us: ""Remember, remember, the fifth of November, The gunpowder treason and plot. I know of no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot"", we follow a young woman in the streets of London. Our first character, Evey, works for a TV station. And it is in a dark alley, as she is surprised by the curfew, that V -our second character- will save her from a very dark fate at the hands of Sutler's militia (very reminiscent of the WW2 Italian militias, only lacking the black bandanna on their arm). V, all in black and with a mysterious smiling mask, has indeed a Vendetta with the current government, and beyond this, he wants to awaken people from their slumber and let them see that their fear, more than their bonds, is preventing them from being free. With Evey, V decides he may have found a precious ally. Even if an unwanting one...<br/><br/>Many people have linked the political background to current US events (and government). I happen to think it is much more subtle than this (the televangelist introduction must also be seen as Sutler's government current in-movie propaganda, and not a view of the makers of V). V takes us farther than a criticism of the current governments, it asks questions -and gives the authors answers, without moralizing- about timeless and important facts of the human life. Is Freedom (physical, of speech, political) important ? What would we give up for Freedom, our lives ? Does an arguably good end justify all means ? Can a government akin to Hitler's rise again ? Among a society dominated by Fear, what is the importance of Education and Culture ?<br/><br/>On top of that brilliant screenplay, the acting was very good, with -amazingly enough- an incredible Hugo Weaving as 'V' who made the character so much more than a Vigilante dressed in black with a mask. He gives the Hero a true personality, and the dialogues are simply wonderful. Nathalie Portman is mostly equally good, with maybe some weaker dialogues toward the end. The photo, the effects, and the settings were pretty much perfect, the score accompanying the images flawlessly. A movie with both Form and Depth, -and- good dialogues ? That is rare enough to be noted and appreciated.<br/><br/>A Very Valiant and Valuable Venture by Virtue of 'V' 's Vibrant Vanguard !!"
"Carummery","10","1","4","21 March 2006"," The best movie I've seen in a long time
","First of all, I love comic book movies. X-men, Spiderman, Superman, Batman, all of those are really good action movies. The difference with V for Vendetta is that it has more of a thriller/detective story then just purely action and romance between the lead characters.<br/><br/>The characters in the story are very interesting, and the Wachowski brothers give each one such a powerful story that you lose yourself in each one. First of all, Natalie Portman, Evey, is a beautiful and talented actress, showing some of her best acting in this movie as a confused, dare I say, hostage to V's ideals. V is the most charming movie character I have ever seen and heard. I could watch this movie over and over again and fall in love with his character a million times. The writers did such a great job of making V an intellectual anarchist. The Chief Inspector Finch also has an important role while trying to find V and trying to keep under the radar of the Fascist Brittian Government.<br/><br/>The storyline is magnificent, touching on so many different stories in one epic tale of rebellion against the Dictatorship of John Sutler. V for Vendetta is a movie you'll have to see over and over to understand all of the different tales that the Wachowski brothers try to convey. Don't consider the 132 minute time frame, because you will be a slave to this film's power, and the 2 hours and 20 minutes will blow by before you even grasp the opening scene.<br/><br/>I personally cannot wait for this movie to come out on DVD so I can experience the full effects of this film. I suggest you go right now and see this movie."
"whogivesajack","8","1","4","19 March 2006"," ""Belief is hard to kill"" as theme
","I had no previous knowledge about any background on this movie going into the theater. I was confused at first by the masked character, V, unclear as to his purpose. I liked the action scenes in the movie, Wachowski brothers combined great story telling with captivating action scenes. The movie takes a bold stab at issues like terrorism and corruption in government during the times of turmoil right now with Bush's war against terrorism. V's character is an ideal that does not oscillate to exterior forces, he holds steadfast to the Utopian ways. What if V's ideal were not so noble, what if his ideals leads to another fascist dictatorship. Besides all those unanswered question, this story is one of passion for humanity, love for honest ideals and passion in revolution without mercy. I loved this movie."

","Because this movie was chock full of symbolism and analogies. The movie requires some patience because it starts off somewhat slow. It is very wordy with a lot of dialog from the main characters. The dialog isn't so much important to the plot as it is important to the character build up. If you have the patience to watch the story unfold you find that the plot and point of the movie is incredibly profound and even more relevant to todays climate.<br/><br/>I didn't fully know what to expect from the Wachowsky brothers after they bombed (in my opinion) with Matrix Revolutions, but besides Natalie Portmans annoying British accent this movie was well worth the money."

The first half of this movie is kinda slow and has a lot of dialogue, but the second half heats up a lot giving us something to remember. V For Vendetta is a must see movie.

It is the best movie that has come in a while, Its not just another comic book to movie film.<br/><br/>Visually, its amazing, all the special effects are top notch, there will only be one or two parts that are cheesy, but doesn't every movie have them?

It also had a brilliant message about how some in power use fear, hatred, and the like to control the people.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman played the role of her career and should be mentioned in the Oscar race next year.

"mikeholmberg","7","1","4","19 March 2006"," Meh
","Well I guess that rewrite that was supposed to be done to the old script didn't do much because it was still very meh. Great compared to the crap Wachowski bros were releasing recently. For those of you who have read the inspiring graphic novel of the same name... don't expect much, everyone else... it was a better then average film and I would recommend seeing it. I was let down by the gimping of my favorite scene from the GN, but I guess a removable arm with tear gas and C4 in it is too much to ask for. They gave V emotions which was completely contradictory to the real V, and they completely messed around with Eveys character. On the upside they keep the same feel as the GN which is always nice, and most of the important scenes were there."
"captwinklr","10","1","4","18 March 2006"," Holy Cow
","This film is paramount, a superb intellectual adventure fun for all ages. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone who enjoys intricate dialogue (I'm a sucker for such) and heartwarming romance, alike. It was more so the dialogue which captured my pure essence in revival, providing feeling as if I too had a knack for anarchistic tendencies (of course I would never pursue such notion, I live in a wonderful society under a capitalist government) that is, If i did live in a totalitarian society. V speaks with eloquent prose to which everything he says has meaning, like Shakespeare in modern everyday language, giving the story structure. It is wild how one can be sucked in to such a character, a character in which has one facial expression--a Guy Fawkes mask, but the hand gestures and seemingly intriguing, soft-spoken but complex dialogue capture the audience, ultimately leaving a feeling of rebuttal for government. One tends to pull for a freedom fighter, and cheer on as he successfully refutes parliament. All in all, a great picture. I have seen it twice now and it only gets better with more experience. If you have not seen V For Vendetta, go out and see it. 4 out of 4 stars. Superb."

One of Natalie Portmans best performances.<br/><br/>I would have to articulate that the political position that this film substantiates happens to succumb to our conceivable, yet present government's judgments and convictions. That having been said the film rings true. And the Warchowski Brothers wrote a script lacking the cliché and trite dialogue, which is so routine and collective in todays films.<br/><br/>I would encourage anyone who wants to watch a film that is entertaining, politically charged, romantic w/a dash of history should hasten and get to a theater, snatch some popcorn and get absorbed in this smashing film.

"druss44121-1","8","1","4","18 March 2006"," Ban This Movie.... JUST KIDDING
","Perhaps better than any theatrical release from last year, this new film from the forces behind The Matrix succeeds as both enticing entertainment and as an emotive discussion starter.<br/><br/>Taking place in the near future, V for Vendetta presents a totalitarian England where freedoms are taken away in the name of security. A man simply known as V uses tactics of terrorism to fight back at the government while also trying to stir up revolution amongst the oppressed people of his country.<br/><br/>Then in comes the average everyday girl Evey, who soon finds herself embroiled with V and his fight.<br/><br/>A good film works on many levels, and every aspect of the multilayered V for Vendetta succeeds.<br/><br/>It has interesting political ideas, dealing with themes of corruption, freedom, terrorism and truth.<br/><br/>The notion that one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter is explored, but the complexities of such a concept are never ignored. The tragically heroic V is not meant as an example of Osama, and this is not Fahrenheit 9/11 2: Now With Masks.<br/><br/>The script is written by the Wachowski brothers, the guys behind The Matrix trilogy, and V for Vendetta resembles the first Matrix more than its sequels.<br/><br/>Rather than assaulting with pseudo-philosophy and overlong action sequences, this is an involving experience with a genuine story arc and characters that are both textured and real.<br/><br/>At the beginning, it is somewhat unclear how everyone will turn out, and there is surprising tenderness and yet complexity carried throughout the story. This balance is often hard to maintain.<br/><br/>The direction from newcomer James McTeigue is fresh, and the images brought to the screen clearly contain ambition and passion.<br/><br/>The performances cannot be overlooked, either. Natalie Portman does a great job as Evey, but the real standout is Huge Weaving as V. Best known as Agent Smith from the Matrix trilogy, his face is always covered by a mask.<br/><br/>He transcends these limitations, though, just as his character does. Through subtle movements and the sound of his voice, his emotions are always felt.<br/><br/>Of course, then there is the ""C"" word: controversy.<br/><br/>While I've only heard a few voices of outrage, for anybody who does think this is simply an anti-American pro-terrorism film, I urge you to see it.<br/><br/>Besides the fact that the source material was not written to match such beliefs (the graphic novel V for Vendetta is based on was written in the mid 90s), for as many existent parallels to modern American politics as there are, there are also differences.<br/><br/>That's not to say this isn't a timely film, or that it doesn't deal with important issues of today.<br/><br/>However, the ""bad guy"" totalitarian government here has more in common with the Taliban or Nazi Germany than the Bush administration.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta also has a lot of references to history and historical art, and its theme is more than a simple appraisal or condemnation of some new political practice. In many ways this is a universal story that is unlikely to age.<br/><br/>Still, don't forget that this is entertainment, too. The action is fast paced, the dialogue sharp, and it is truly enjoyable to sit through.<br/><br/>If controversy does sell, then at least here it is selling a great product.<br/><br/>Critic's Conclusion: Filled with involving characters and intriguing ideas, V for Vendetta succeeds in many ways as it moves beyond controversy or political hot points to do the most important thing of all: tell a story. Few films are brilliant, but this surely comes close."
"irussian","10","1","4","17 March 2006"," Powerful moving in perfect timing
","This is not your typical comic book turned movie. V for Vendetta will without a doubt cause controversy. I can not express how thankful I am someone made this film. This film touches base with many current controversies (mainly pertaining to the American Government). As an American I am in no way offended and I hope no one in England is either. Natalie Portman gives the best performance of her career. It would be a travesty for her not to receive an Oscar nomination. Though there is some bloodshed, I feel everyone should witness this film.

"nived84","6","1","4","17 March 2006"," One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter
","I bought a copy of the graphic novel V for Vendetta last August and quickly read through it in about five days. I was left stunned and amazed. And now, almost eight months later after having seen the film adaptation of the book I am still left somewhat stunned and amazed, but also somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong V for Vendetta is a pretty good movie; it's smart, thought-provoking, exciting and makes for a great conversation starter. But to me the Wachowski Brothers did tinker quite a bit with the graphic novel, in some ways good, and in some ways very bad. But even with those changes I still rather enjoyed my time at the movies. I just hope those who do go out and see it will leave the theater with the urgent feeling of going out and reading the graphic novel.<br/><br/>First off, before we get into it let me just express my appreciation for the two lead performances from Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving. Both of them turn in great performances that do the source material real justice. Where was this Natalie Portman during the Star Wars movies? And Hugo Weaving had an amazing challenge having to act through a mask the entire film with a fixed facial expression and in the end was able to still create a character that you can at one moment hate, and at another love. The beginning of the film differs from the book, and it was pretty pointless to have changed it, but the film's ending I must say is a real knockout, so much so that I thought for a moment I might actually be blown out of the back wall of the theater and into the parking lot. The screenplay which was written by Andy and Larry Wachowski does drop the ball every now and again. A lot of the graphic novel has been changed, altered, or tossed out. Like I said before some of the changes are good, and others are bad. But the overall essence of the V for Vendetta graphic novel is somehow quite intact, but for those of you reading this who haven't yet seen the film, or read the graphic novel, don't worry I won't spoil anything for you.<br/><br/>The plot sounds very similar to George Orwell's 1984, which even author Alan Moore admits was one of many major influences on V for Vendetta when he wrote it back in the early 80's. In fact that's what helps make V for Vendetta a really great story and ultimately a really good movie; the issues and topics it takes on, and to this day we are still talking about them. V for Vendetta wasn't written two or three years ago, but over twenty years ago, and it still holds up. The story imagines a place where, what if Germany had won WWII, and England became a fascist state; where freedom is a long forgotten thing of the past. And one man, who was horrifically scarred both mentally and psychically by this government, decides to strike back using terrorist tactics trying to start a revolution or uprising, and inspire and lead his fellow countrymen to freedom. He calls himself V, and he wears a Guy Fawkes mask. V saves a young woman named Evey from some nasty Policemen late one night, eventually Evey grows to respect and admire him, and soon becomes his protégé.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a dark, intense comic book film more along the lines of Batman Begins. It's a serious film with some serious ideas. Some parts are quite uncomfortable to sit through because it is so contemporary, while others are a fiery blast of adrenaline to the eyes (and the ears). The film does take a few liberties, and takes a few extra jabs at conservatives, who oddly enough weren't actually mentioned by name in the book to begin with. Some people will look at this film as an anti-Bush film; some will just merely say it's an anti-fascism film. Some will say that the character of V is a terrorist, and others will say he's a freedom fighter. Just remember one thing; the guy who's calling V a terrorist is basically a caricature of Adolf Hitler. A terrorist against Hitler, is that really such a bad thing? So I think depending on how you go into this film, and how you look at things will ultimately help determine how much you like, or dislike it. Personally I never saw the character of V as a terrorist, but as a revolutionary. V doesn't quite fit the bill of a terrorist. I mean he never goes out and intends to harm innocent people, in fact the only people that are on his ""list"" if you want to call it that, are precisely government officials and the ones responsible for turning him into the monster that he is.<br/><br/>The film also touches on a number of hot button issues such as, well terrorism for starters, and the tactics used by terrorists, like suicide bombings. It also makes a statement on the persecution of homosexuals, a Bishop with a pedophile problem and it even manages to show us how the media can, or does manipulate the news; which ultimately affects what we chose to believe or not believe. This is a very risky picture to be sure, and not everyone's gonna like it, that's just the way it is. But when all is said and done, it will leave you with something to think about afterwards. And even though the film may have messed around with the graphic novel a little too much, it's still the same journey, and it still raises a lot of the same questions, and for those reasons alone makes V for Vendetta the first must-see film of 2006."
"robert-667","7","1","4","17 March 2006"," Better as swashbuckling drama than as political commentary
","ZORRO MEETS 1984 - a film review by Robert Fleeman.<br/><br/>There is a common phrase known in conservative circles on the internet which is identified by the acronym BDS. The letters are short for ""Bush Derangement Syndrome."" It identifies anyone whose extreme hatred of President George W. Bush blinds them to the point that rationality no longer applies. To these individuals and organizations, Bush isn't just wrong about everything, he is simply the root of all evil.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go so far as to identify the Wachowski Brothers as sufferers of this condition, but their latest effort: V For Vendetta, certainly shows some symptoms of the disease. Based on the graphic novel by Englishman Alan Moore, who intended his work as an criticism of the conservative Thatcher administration, this adaptation contains numerous swipes at the current American administration. References to dominating a people through a climate of fear, torturing dissidents and rounding up homosexuals are no doubt meant as metaphors for the Bush presidency. In this movie, simply being identified as a conservative is the same thing as being evil.<br/><br/>Fortunately, if you are not politically oriented, it is possible to enjoy this swashbuckling tale of a lone warrior who fights against a totalitarian government which has taken hold of England in the near future. Identified only as V, this knife-wielding avenger is never seen without his costume or Guy Fawkes mask. For those who don't know, Guy Fawkes was an English nobleman who plotted with others in the early 17th century to blow up the English Parliament. Apparently, the event is mockingly celebrated every year in England, on the fifth of November. The reference for V is appropriate, given that he has similar plans for the current government which bears great resemblance to Nazi Germany and the fictionalized regime found in George Orwell's book 1984.<br/><br/>V (Hugo Weaving) is a lone warrior until he meets Evey (Natalie Portman), a young and beautiful woman he rescues one evening from despicable members of the secret police. She inadvertently becomes his protégé, assisting V in his efforts to get to certain representatives of the government, corrupt clergy and willing members of the media. It turns out that V's efforts aren't just political, but also heavily personal as he seeks revenge for events earlier in his life.<br/><br/>A counterpoint storyline follows the efforts of two detectives, one played by Stephen Rea, to discover the identity of V. The closer the two come to figuring out who V is, the more they become convinced that he isn't the real problem. John Hurt also stars as Chancellor Adam Sutler, the diabolical leader of the brutal regime. Hurt also starred in the film version of 1984, playing a victim of the totalitarian state.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving, best known as Mr. Smith in the Matrix movies and the elf king in the LOTR trilogy, does quite well given the limited opportunity to act behind V's porcelain mask. His soft, mannerly English accent is a nice counterpoint to the bizarre getup that is both stunning and funny at the same time. Natalie Portman continues her fine work (outside of the recent Star Wars trilogy), having to maintain an English accent for the duration of the film. She also undergoes a stunning physical transformation that dramatically alters her appearance.<br/><br/>One of the things that I did like about this film is the fact that V isn't presented as just a heroic figure. He is a truly obsessed man, wrapped up in his own world, bearing more than a passing resemblance to the Phantom of the Opera. He does quite a few things in this movie that will make you question whether or not you should be rooting for his character. In some ways the true heroine of the piece is Evey.<br/><br/>The film drags a little bit in the middle, but for the most part keeps the interest level high, as it is a fresh take on an old concept. I just wish the film makers would have left out references to current politics. It was an unnecessary inclusion and only serves to alienate a significant portion of the audience. This seems to be a continuing theme for me lately, as so many politicized movies have come out lately, all leaning heavily to the left."
"superratty-tmy","Null","1","4","16 March 2006"," Comic Vendetta
","It's an absolutely amazing movie.<br/><br/>Based on a DC/Vertigo comic book, V for Vendetta is about futuristic England that has come under ultra conservative totalitarian rule of a Nazi-like government. In comes codename ""V"", the terrorist/hero (interesting combination, one of the highlights of the movie) who seeks to revolt by overthrowing the government on the heavily symbolic Guy Fawkes day.<br/><br/>In comes Evey Hammond, an everyday girl who stumbles into V and hears his view on government, and the rest of it... is... about... vengeance.<br/><br/>The line that V utters in the trailer ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people"" pretty much sums up the theme of the movie. As citizens, do we endorse terrorism? We do not, but watching V for Vendetta, one cannot escape positioning V as the true hero of the film. In some unexplainable way, we see the world through his mask, and almost sympathetically, let terrorism justify itself.<br/><br/>It is an amazing film. Natalie Portman delivers a strong performance as a good girl turned activist, and the Chancellor of England (John Hurt) despite having most of his scenes displayed through another screen, fires bullet rounds of his government propaganda with devastatingly powerful speeches and dialogue. Stephen Rea's character, as Chief Inspector Finch, is perhaps the character that we follow the most closely. He is like us, an audience, witnessing the events unfold, and whether his mind changes is one of the key story lines of the story.<br/><br/>Soundly cut, aptly photographed, and psychotically pleasing to the eye, V for Vendetta is a rare hit for March. It was supposed to be released August/September last year, but was postponed due to the terrorist bombings in London last year (which has some resemblance to the film).<br/><br/>The only downside to the film is perhaps the terrorism itself as well. The film leans too heavily to the terrorist camp, and fires every cylinder there is to let it's pro-freedom ideals take flight. It is too obvious, the stand the movie is taking. Ironically, the movie can easily be described as a propaganda to expose propaganda.<br/><br/>Overall, V for Vendetta is realistically futuristic, elegantly scripted, and politically charged, all achieved without forsaking the comic-book atmosphere. The film is almost what one can imagine as the complete comic book adaptation.<br/><br/>It's nice to have a surprise this early in the year.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"
"zetes","7","2","13","20 March 2006"," A film that should be easily dismissable
","It has a very mixed message and one of the sloppiest screenplays I've encountered in quite some time (Andy and Larry Wachowski, the directors and screenwriters of the Matrix Trilogy, are responsible for it). The lead character wears a mask the entire time, so the character has almost no ability to engage the audience himself. Plus, nearer the end, he is turned from a person into a purely figurative symbol. Natalie Portman has to carry the entire movie, and, while she's very beautiful, even when shaved bald, she's not a strong enough performer to accomplish the task (plus, her British accent is less than believable). There are also a ton of silly and unbelievable moments. However, with all that against it, V for Vendetta has some intriguing ideas and is a fairly rousing picture in the end. The story posits a fascist government in Britain in the near future (or in an alternative present). Most of the film's value exists in the believability of this government and how it operates. The film pays close attention to how the government and the media control the people. The references to modern day America are clear, and it's not hard to buy that a similar course of events could take place. There's even scenes where the government is listening into citizens, which is a current event that couldn't have been news when this script was being written. A fair amount of our population, directly after September 11th, said that they would give up their privacies and freedoms in exchange for safety. The hero of the film, V, is a terrorist, any way you look at it, and that is problematic for sure. The movie does not necessarily side with his cause completely, but it certainly doesn't reject his ideas either. The movie uses the story of Guy Fawkes; V wants to carry out what Fawkes failed at. If you know the story, you might guess the ending. But as my friend wondered, how would the movie be accepted if the film had ended with the Capitol building in Washington D.C. being destroyed? A difficult movie to deal with, but definitely worth sitting through."

","Well,...<br/><br/>Facsism born from fear. It has never been more actual than today. I really like the kind of story; fear dictates society and has been used by a few ones to get on top of politics and media to satisfy their greed for power and money. Mankind got suppressed by illusions created by all kinds of media, which also lays in the hand of politics. But there's hope - a fighter for freedom sees through corruption and greed and all the plans that were made to control society. His name is Guy Fawkes. So till here all is fine. Nice story, well done. So far.. But the protagonist ""Guy Fawkes"" looks ridiculous. He wears a masks that makes him smile all the way. He became a fighter for rights and humanity, the moral Institution of mankind, as he got abused as a test-person for some new kind of virus. Like ""Hulk"" he breaks through his cell and raises to seek revenge. And this was the point where I started to dislike the film. Too sci-fi, too ""Hollywood-made-up"", too much action, that it became ridiculous and no more serious, as the political and moralic intention actually is and should be. Dear people: Government really uses you to empower their chosen ones, at the cost of our life's! So I'd like to shout out:""HELLO, THIS REALLY _IS_ HAPPENING, take it more serious and erase your stupid Hollywood-action"".

Maybe some of them select to quit while others select the combat in the world. And some of them are successful or not to be. Therefore, the movie tells that condition and It tells significant things about life of a man who is V and the man who fight to hardship things. I want to say that İt is the second creative movie which I have ever watched. Personally, it reflects both bravery and frailty. At one side, there is the man who want to take revenge and another side there is a woman. And love. Maybe love is not completely used at movie but I think there is the man who fall in love. I certainly saw the revenge of the man and this state is so bad for the man who called V. and the only thing to be done to fight and to brave. So ,someday he meets the woman and then everything changes in the woman's life. Later ,she is included in his life. so he starts to take revenge and kills his enemies in orderly."

"cernan","9","1","5","9 June 2008"," Ideas are Bulletproof
","The idea that this film centers on isn't something new. In fact Orwell wrote about it in his novel ""1984"" some fifty plus years ago. A totalitarian regime is in power and uses fear to mandate obedience. The mysterious figure known as V rescues a young woman from the secret police. Emulating the historical figure Guy Fawkes, he aims to rally the people to overthrow the government through a series of elaborate plots with intricate planning.<br/><br/>The plot is absolutely superb. There are twists and turns and the unexpected that leave you gaping in shock when you finally do realize... The casting was quite good, and minus the sub-par British accent, Natalie Portman's performance was breathtaking. But Hugo Weaving had the real standout performance. An actor's job is already tough as it is, however Weaving had to go the extra mile, delivering all of his lines from behind a mask and excelling at it. He made the mysterious yet charismatic character V believable, and we as viewers were able to sympathize with the man behind the mask.<br/><br/>There were times when I was absolutely appalled, even shaking my head in disbelief. There were also a handful of tender moments that really got me thinking about many things. Our integrity for one, and our moral sense of right and wrong. Courage against all odds, and finding that resolve to stay true to yourself.<br/><br/>The message that this film carries is one of hope. No matter what the situation is, and no matter what kinds of unfair policies are being implemented, there is always room and possibility for change. Although the idea of change may at times be abstract, it will always exist because freedom of thought is one thing that cannot be stamped out no matter what the dictator or regime believes. In the darkest hour of the hardest day, under the most oppressive government, ideas are bulletproof."

"cherold","8","1","5","4 April 2007"," entertaining but problematic
","V for Vendetta is certainly a fascinating movie. In a future England in which right wing fear mongers have taken over the country and subjugated its people (basically the world as people like George W. Bush would make it if they could) a masked vigilante fights to bring down the government.<br/><br/>At first the movie seems like an updated Zorro, and in some ways it is, following the formula of the noble hero battling for downtrodden people against enormous odds. But the tone is increasingly dark as the movie progresses, and the parallels with our current world situation make it sharp political commentary.<br/><br/>So I liked the movie, I enjoyed the movie, but I was also bothered by the movie. Because it really is not critical of V's actions; it's pretty much on V's side. That's true generally of those lawless hero stories like Robin Hood or Zorro, but what V does goes far beyond Robin Hood-style justice. Arguably those old swashbucklers had a very simplistic view of the world, but they were simple movies with fantasy villains that rarely attempted to draw any significant parallels to the real world.<br/><br/>There is an interesting moral question in this movie: is terrorism justified against an oppressive, dangerous government. But Vendetta doesn't really see the complexities of the issue. It's not interested in messy realities, yet it focuses too much on political realities (and political paranoia) to come across as a simple allegory. You can call it pro-terrorism or pro-revolution (they have often historically been the same thing). Revolution does not always lead to a better government, terrorism rarely leads to a better world, and violence is self perpetuating, so that fighting violence with violence simply condemns us to a continuous cycle of violence. And how often are the lines between good and evil so clearly drawn in the real world? Or perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps there are cases when a little terrorism would have been a great idea, say against Hitler, who of course is always a good example for pretty much anything. On the other hand, would terrorism against McCarthy have worked out well or made things worse? Do terrorist actions cause people to rise up or rally around their government? All good questions, but while watching the movie made me think about them, the movie itself isn't interested in any of that. They make no attempt to expose the underlying issues. People who are prone to think about the complexities of the world can watch the movie and start thinking about these things, but the movie doesn't encourage that at all.<br/><br/>Still, I enjoyed watching it, even if it is at best politically naive and at worst dangerous."

I've never heard of the director of this one and I've never bothered with the seemingly incomprehensible MATRIX trilogy (whose makers serve as the screenwriters here) but, as I said before, I found it to be an intelligent, enjoyable and altogether very satisfying outing which, thankfully, seems not be the start of another franchise which diminishes in quality with every subsequent entry..."
"Blade_Le_Flambeur","4","1","5","21 July 2006"," Ideas are not, in fact, bulletproof
","'V for Vendetta' marks the debut of James McTeigue, an assistant director to the likes of George Lucas and The Wachowski brothers who penned the screenplay. It's a dramatic, theatrical action/political film about a fascist society and one man's stand against it. It was based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore, who initially wrote it as an attack on the new rule of Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s. However, both as an action film and a political message it stumbles and fails.<br/><br/>Evey Hammond works is a humble citizen of the state who works in a television station. One night she is stopped by the police for passing curfew and is attacked and nearly raped. Fortunately for her, an enigmatic but gregarious hero named V (Hugo Weaving) comes to the rescue. The film begins to snowball from here, as V eventually lists Evey into helping him defeat the fascist society spearheaded by Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt), who's basically Big Brother with a voice. Also on the case is weary Inspector Erich Finch (Stephen Rea), who's not quite convinced that V's a terrorist simply killing civilians. The film is full of dialogue and action alike, and contains less than subtle remarks concerning the current Bush administration. Unfortunately, this is where the film fails.<br/><br/>I do not let political feelings get in the way of analyzing and reviewing film, but 'V for Vendetta' is incredibly blunt and even hackneyed. There are several reasons why the swipes at Bush feel unnecessary and poor. For one, the Wachowski Bros. wrote the screenplay in the 1990s, so why would it contain references to Avian Flu, homosexual marriage, etc? And if based upon a graphic novel written in the early 80s, how does this fit in either? It doesn't, and that is the fatal error. The filmmakers allow their own political opinions to hijack how they conceive and execute the premise. A flashback concerning a lesbian couple and their suffering doesn't fit in the film like it should, it feels tacked on to make another point. As an action movie, there's not much excitement either. There are plenty of slick visuals, but this alone doesn't make a good film. As many explosions and fights with the police as there are, this doesn't equate to action being driven by story.<br/><br/>Portman is a solid actress, but here she doesn't astound. She's given relatively little to do and must wait on the sidelines as V delivers monologue after monologue on how brutal the government is, how the situation came to be, etc. etc. Weaving, who rarely disappoints, is very much up to the task and provides some good natured if not jovial fun as the masked crusader. Rea, one of the often ignored actors of his generation, proves himself even if his role is limited. Hurt (who ironically started in a 1984 adaptation of '1984') hams it up as Sutler, but it's merely another piece of the puzzle. The script feels muddled, cluttered, and too political. McTeigue goes by the books on how to shoot action sequences, frame the story, etc. It feels more like a Wachowski film.<br/><br/>'V for Vendetta' is a weak film. It has some impressive visuals, and some exciting scenes, not to mention some rock solid supporting performances. These alone propel slightly above terrifyingly terrible, but that doesn't mean it's not awful.<br/><br/>4/10"

"flicklover","8","1","5","22 March 2006"," Finally!!! A decent film in the worst time of the year.
","From about January to the beginning of May every year, I dread going to the movie, Most of the films that come out at this time are bad. Whether they be action , drama , or comedy. A few times there are surprises, but most of the time the movies are average at best. Well V for Vendetta is the first film I've seen all year that I could say that I actually liked. The story is basically a mix of 1984 meets the crow, and has elements of all comic/graphic novel films that came before it. But it has good dialog and even manages to have something to say. It takes place in the near future and the UK has turned into a totalitarian society. A masked man goes around London blowing things up, and is branded a terrorist. Evfen though the story doesn't make this guy into an all out hero, I will say that in a post 9/11 world, blowing buildings up is a touchy subject. I wouldn't say that the makers of this film advocate this kind of protest, but the film make the case that governments use fear to control the population. Though many people have stated that this is a direct criticism of the current Bush/Blair world, I think that the film's ideas can be applied to any sort of governing body. Many would say that it is an irresponsible premise, that argument is also valid, but I think the movie doesn't go deep enough for it to be a problem. It is after all a work of pulp fiction.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the film is never boring, it moves at a pretty fast pace. And even though there is plenty of action, the performances are good, and the story is involving. It is entertaining, and does have a couple of interesting things to say.

","It's a good movie. It's not a great movie.<br/><br/>As with all the Wachowski Bros. films, they do a good job of negating the reason for their own existence. As with the Matrix: I've never heard anyone ask the obvious question: ""Why build the Matrix?"" Yeah, yeah, people are batteries, I get it. So? Why not grow human bodies for the power and render the brain comatose? Poof. Body still generates power, no requirement for a Matrix, no need for agents, robots rule the world, yay, done. Also, of course, there'd be no movie, but it does seem like they should have thought of a better answer to that question than no answer at all.<br/><br/>In a way, it's the same with V. All through the movie we see reluctant participants in a fascist regime. Yes, the ""Hand"" party members are truly nefarious - no, wait, not all of them. Finch is actually a pretty decent guy when it comes down to it. He can even trust his right-hand man, no worries there. And through the rest of it, yes, we meet party members who are worried over their own skins, but they all just seem like harried bureaucrats, who all probably have kids, sensible cars, and nice Christmases every year. At the end, when the populace is advancing on the army, and the army is unable to contact anyone in charge - a huge stretch, since this entire army apparently only has one or two people in charge and when they're out of commission, well, everything just comes to a halt - the army refuses to shoot on its own people. Wow. They're all just a really bunch of nice guys who, under other circumstances, are forced to do, golly, things that just aren't very nice.<br/><br/>It's absurd. It wouldn't be difficult to show the horrors of fascism, they abound in our own everyday world. But in this world, it just seems like the Chancellor's a prick, the ""Hand"" is a bunch of pricks to lesser degrees, and everyone else is, gosh darn it, just trying to make their way in this crazy, messed-up world.<br/><br/>The gaytred theme is played up a little too much, as well. Stephen Fry must tragically live behind a mask. V has a built a shrine to a lesbian director whose life is cut criminally short due to her proclivities. The director's story is really good, actually, but because it's so long in the move, and because it's paired with Fry's story as well, it just makes the whole regime seem like a bunch of right-wingers who hate gays and who, ultimately, build an army that won't even shoot on its own people when it comes down to it. It draws too much attention to rumors and images of Larry Wachowski's personal life, and as you're watching the movie you can hear the distinct sound of someone grinding an axe.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is stunning, and the acting really carries the rest. Portman is wonderful, as are Hugo Weaving and Stephen Rea. And the character of V is compelling enough to make you really want to see how things turn out. So is the movie worth watching? Well, if it's able to sustain interest until the end, then sure, it's worth watching. But is it a *great* movie? No, not by a long shot, despite that many fête the Wachowski Bros. as ""geniuses"". They're really good, very skilled, and a lot of fun. Quirky. But they're not geniuses, folks, and this movie is, at the end of it all, fun but just okay."

The film really addresses a number of issues all to prevalent in the post 9/11 world: spying, government monitoring, controlled release of information/misinformation (spin).<br/><br/>The character of V is given a good deal of personality despite the fact he never takes the mask off, which will no doubt disappoint some. Natalie Portman, despite the forced accent is probably one of a select group of women who look about as good with a shaved head as they do with full hair. She wasn't overwhelming here, but she was certainly adequate.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a great film for anyone who is looking for a good story wrapped around some very cool action film fight sequences. Yes, the Alan Moore purists have come out in force pointing out all the problems with this movie, but the same thing happens with any other adaptation (remember Asimov fans tearing up ""I, Robot""?

The actions of the chancellor reminds me of the way the US President is acting and I don't think that is a coincidence because the Wachowski Brothers don't seem to shy away from making statements (similar to Michael Moore). :-)"
"mgk4786","9","1","5","18 March 2006"," A good way to represent the graphic novel
","First, I would like to say that this movie is great even though it differs slightly from the graphic novel. Fortunately, the differences did not affect the quality of the general story. I think that the Wachowski brothers did an excellent job of converting this great story into a great movie. Since the graphic novel was so complex, it was necessary to remove some of the sub-stories and supporting characters to appeal to a wider audience. I was a bit upset at how they portrayed Evey. Don't get me wrong, I think that this could be Natalie Portman's strongest role yet, but her character was written quite a bit more shallow than she was portrayed in the book. The same thing could be said about V. Hugo Weaving played the part of V as good, if not better than I expected. But, I still wish that they would have gone a bit more in-depth about his past. While I was watching this movie, I became increasingly concerned with how dumbed-down the ending would be. I was pleasantly surprised that even thought the ending was quite a bit different from the end of the book, that it still preserved the concept of the original story's ending. I definitely recommend seeing this movie, and I would also recommend reading the masterpiece written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd."

","This movie tries to be a step above the average tale of freedom-loving hero versus totalitarian government. It leaves you with plenty to think about. For one thing, the hero (Hugo Weaving) is a terrorist. Does that mean we can't root for him? Some may say yes, while others say no. I guess you could say one man's hero is another man's terrorist.<br/><br/>The government of V is definitely evil, however. Does that make this film a political commentary on our own governments? Critics of the current U.S. government will find a few parallels between the government of Adam Sutler (John Hurt) and Bush's administration. These are examples of things that may crop up in your mind when you watch this movie. But this is also a movie that can be enjoyed by people who just want to watch a film and enjoy it without thinking hard about it (There is no shame in this).<br/><br/>The movie itself is very well presented with an outstanding cast. Natalie Portman gets to portray a well defined character (as opposed to her character in Star Wars III) and she succeeds brilliantly. The rest of the cast shines as well.<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you are looking for a movie that makes you think, or something just to entertain you, this movie will fit the bill either way."

""V"" was awesome, though. He was a very kind man with a good heart, reason, and cooking. This dude had it all: a secret underground lair, the stealth, and the skills. No one could stop him... right?

","This movie has, rather appropriately, supplanted The Matrix as my favourite. Although I have never read the original V for Vendetta, the Orwellian feeling of the movie is excellently produced. England, and especially London, as it might appear as a totalitarian state has been beautifully rendered. Those who are familiar with the city might find a number a recognizable landmarks subtly altered to match their role in an England with overbearing government. These similarities with present day, as well as timely references to ""terrorism,"" make the film highly relevant.<br/><br/>The various elements really come together to make this one of the better movies I have seen in some time. The well put together story makes the film easy to follow, but the camera work is also very well done, and the soundtrack is rather catchy, as well. The script is first rate, and one of the initial scenes has a monologue containing alliteration the likes of which I have not heard since Melville finished Moby Dick.<br/><br/>Altogther, I feel that this movie entirely accomplishes what it, and its originating story, set out to do. Viewers will come away pondering the dangers of placing too much faith and subsequent control in the hands of the government. The jabs taken at the Church are a little antagonistic, but well aimed and not entirely inaccurate. Too, the sheer amount of blood spilled in one or two scenes isn't entirely necessary, but this is not enough to damn what is otherwise an incredibly well done film."

","While some may discredit the presentation of the themes that constitute ""V for Vendetta,"" I find that the continuity and depth of such poignant issues warrant merit to not only the writer of this film, but also to those passionate enough to produce and support it. Yes, it has been called the ""extended dance mix"" to the decade's list of media-hyped threats. However, its beats resonate the hopes and fears of our recent past, and it echoes clearly the dangers of totalitarian regimes whose Machiavellian tactics prey upon peoples' fear of faceless terror. It is because this movie in many ways acts as a more accessible catalyst for democracy and freedom (I'm sure Orwell and Huxley have just turned in tandem) that cast it as a star among other pseudo-intellectual films that Hollywood has to offer."

","There's never been a movie I have ever seen that would turn out the way it did. ""V for Vendetta"" is bold, vivid, graphic, and settling all at the same time. Natalie Portman is excellent in everything she does. Playing Evey is not bad. Her British is at top notch. The beginning is very good, and I thought it would be to plain at first. In her other movies, she was always bold in every one of them. In the beginning, she looks more naive than bold. Just wait later on. She even pulled a ""Demi"" in this movie, and the confinement scenes were played out beautifully. Hugo Weaving did an outstanding job as ""V"", the man behind the mask. And that Guy Hawkes mask is forever embedded in my mind. The poetic lyrics, the subtle lines of all the classics(books) intrigued me more than the action. And the fight scenes were very fascinating as well. The daggers were my favorites weapons. They were more like giant switchblades. And that body armor he wore did more protecting that a Kevlar vest ever would. V was very prepared! This movie was worth the wait and the watch, I know London will recover from the chancellor's evil, and the torch will be passed to others who believe. ""V for Vendetta"" is the new all time hit of 2006. Enjoy it while you can. 5 stars!"

If people want inspiration, this is defiantly it. This film shows the realistic view of the future, only if we the people stand up for ourselves. Stand up against the government. Its explosive, twisting, mind boggling, and most importantly inspirational. ""Remember! Remember the 5th of November!"""
"pressboard","10","1","5","17 March 2006"," V is for VERY VERY Good
","The Wachowski's have managed to sync perfectly with our present world and the morass of Bush and Iraq. They do not do this with a heavy hand but the connection is, nevertheless, clear. This makes the ending so much more cathartic. We never see Hugo Weavings face, but his strong voice dominates throughout. His character is not Neo for so many reasons. For one, he quotes Shakespeare and is not seeking an answer, but delivering one. The Main Stream Media have been screaming for days about how this is a movie about terrorism and they are right, but not in the way they would have us believe. It shows how a people were lied to and based their decisions on those lies. The Media, of course, is in lock-step with the Administration and work hand-in-hand with them to maintain a high level of terror to maintain control and power over the populace. John Hurt is especially good as High Chancellor Stutler and is so rabid in his need to dominate and control that he reminds one of many WWII German speeches, whether given by Hitler or one of his henchman. Guy Fawkes was an excellent choice for V, both as a mask and a day for awakening and action. Although V has his own personal agenda, he has lost his identity and found redemption in the same flames that were started and fanned by Chancellor Stutler and his cronies. I recommend this film to everyone, it carries a strong emotional and intellectual message and should be seen."

","packed with plenty of style, bunches of action, various interlinked interesting and engaging characters, a contemporary message that cannot be missed and a couple of attractive leads, both of whom bring forth developed personas, as well as an intriguing relationship, all wrapped up in a giant ball of entertainment. That's right, if you didn't think that a movie can both entertain on a visceral level and warn you about the dangers of ""too much government"" at the same time, prepare yourself to be stupefied as VENDETTA does just that, and does it all in style, grace and a wicked pace that doesn't even give you a second to consider the possibility of getting bored(it's just not going to happen). I was engrossed by this film from scene one all the way through its many deviations, surprises, twists and terrorist turns, as it continually kept things moving, while at the same time, allowing us to follow the events as a detective mightfiltering through all of the clues and twists dropped throughout. Who is this V character? Why did they shave Natalie Portman's head? What really happened to her parents? All pertinent questions which are all slowly responded to, as this futuristic English society begins to crack under the pressure. For me, the film made me question stuff, exhilarated me at various moments (the final ""fight sequence"" was poetry in motionoh, and bloody!), allowed me to relax and enjoy some of its quieter times (the scenes between V and Portman in his underground lair were romantic and Portman dressed up as a lolita was good and ultimately engaged me in a circle of curiosity throughout. The ending wasn't as unpredictable as you might expect, but that was fine, since it was the journey that was the enjoyment for me. The film also had style with everything looking very slick, dark and deadly. It also had a tinge of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE undercurrent working below it, which is always nice. Kudos to all of the actors in the show as well, since their commitments to the characters were also part of what made this film come alive, and extra props to Portman for bringing home her A-game and even Hugo Weaving, who might have had the hardest job of allemoting stuff behind a frozen mask. But you know whathe did it! I felt for this guy and that's the sign of a great actor. All in all, don't go into this film expecting a wham-bam-thank-you-Wachowki type of flick, because it's far from that. This movie contains more ideas than action, more politics than thrills and more ideology than bullet-time, but in the endit does deliver in a little bit of everything, and for methat's always welcome in this world of rehashes and remakes . Viva la V for Vendettafinally, some guts on the big screen! Oh, and if you've always wondered what the difference was between a terrorist and a freedom fighterwonder some more."

","I thought this was a very solid film. I had not read the graphic novel and had no problems keeping up. I also loved the content and the homages to ""1984""(the least of which is casting John Hurt). Perhaps tomorrow I will think it more of an 8 or 9, but tonight it is a 10! I'll admit a few things now though. First, Natalie Portman's vocal track could have been louder in the first five minutes of the film. After all she is narrating. Also, I was personally unprepared for V and didn't quite know what to make of him in his first conversation with Evey. I found it more amusing than annoying and quickly caught up to speed with his glib repartee. Hugo Weaving did an amazing job with his voice and actions to express what was going on behind the mask. I feel I have given it a ten and have only written about the negatives, but that's the kind of movie buff I am. I hate to ruin all the delicious details by saying too much. Rock on Wachowski Bros."

But back to the V for Vandetta, it is an example of a good start to movies this year. The movie scores high in all categories, acting,drama, action, choreography, props and scenery. The movie draws you in and makes you identify with the impacts of the totalitarian society that is depicted. I have to say that Hugo's voice is just remarkable, it gives the character of V some originality and comes out believable. Natalie Portman needs to eat a bit more, but she did look sexy. All and all, i loved the movie, it had the fun and seriousness that should be included in all movies. Brilliantly done and a must see."
"DICK STEEL","7","1","5","16 March 2006"," A Nutshell Review: V for Vendetta
","Remember, remember, the 5th of November. Well, at least that was the original premiere date for V for Vendetta. It would also make a cool (gimmicky) date to open the movie, given that the Wachowskis also premiered their previous movie, The Matrix Revolutions, worldwide simultaneously on 5th November back in 2003.<br/><br/>But fast forward to today, where the Revolutions imploded, and much bad blood spilt from Alan Moore, the writer of the graphic novel from which the Wachowskis adapted this movie from, and giving it a fresh perspective and spin (since the original was set in the late 90s). But gone are the high-tech Matrix-y look, and in place is something quite down to earth, a futuristic England, which is now ruled by a fascist regime.<br/><br/>The populace seem cowered living under curfews and corruption, and while they know about the crap the state controlled media is putting out, they do nothing, and of course are powerless, to effect a regime change. Until the emergence of a strange and mysterious freedom fighter, codenamed V (Hugo Weaving), takes to task the waging of a one-man crusade against oppression, and tosses ideas of civil disobedience to the general population.<br/><br/>Along the way, he rescues and gains an unlikely ally in the form of Evey (Natalie Portman), a teenage girl whom he eventually falls for. Which brings an interesting take into the man and his mission, whether he would abandon what he truly believes in, or forge ahead in his mission, everything else being secondary. While we learn of V's grand plans that will affect statehood, we also learn of his personal agenda in seeking revenge - could both purposes coexist, having effects in one, affecting the other? One man's freedom fighter is another man's terrorist. We look into the creation of V, and take a peek into V's history prior to becoming the warrior he is. It's amazing that the source material, written in the 80s, could be so applicable in today's security environment, that you reap what you sow. It's also chilling that the sentiments echoed in the movie, could be so vividly realistic, that it doesn't matter if a man is gone, so long as he has successfully spread his ideals, and that these ideals naturally have a longer lifespan.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving, though we don't see his face at all, hidden behind a Guy Fawkes' mask, is fabulous as V. Having only body language and a commanding voice from which to emote, I would say he has created a V which would be placed amongst cinematic (anti)heroes, like Darth Vader, although Vader's made up of 2 persons - one the actor in the suit, the other being James Earl Jones' booming voice to flesh the machine.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman somehow disappointed in her role as Evey, as I found her ""finding oneself"" theme a little weak. Perhaps too much attention was given to her hair (or lack thereof), though she looked just as stunning without.<br/><br/>I have not completely read the graphic novel, and therefore could not provide you with a page-by-page comparison, suffice to say that what I've read thus far, does not indicate that V for Vendetta the movie is a direct translation from the pages of the graphic novel ala Sin City (which of course, got the writer's endorsement). However, this movie can and indeed does stand alone, so I might put in an addendum after completing my reading.<br/><br/>Be warned that this movie is not meant for teenagers, not that I'm undermining this group, but they seemed to have fallen for the marketing tactics of promoting V for Vendetta as an outright action movie, as seen in the trailers. Fact is, the themes are mature, and those looking for action will be sorely disappointed, not at the quality, but the quantity.<br/><br/>The action are concentrated in the beginning (which has taken a slight deviation with Evey's intent), and at the end, where the awesome knife-fight sequence, widely touted in the trailers, seem to have set a new bar for close quarter combat. It's poetic, bloody and visually stunning, period.<br/><br/>And because of wanting to put more butts on seats, the NC-16 rating here translated to irritating, jarring edits. There's one near the start, where both V and Evey were watching telly, and another after the midway point, which probably was venturing into some lesbian scenes. But what an eyesore those cuts were. No doubt that while the cuts might not have much effect (and I'm speculating here) on the overall storyline, but it sure did spoil the enjoyment.<br/><br/>I'm being a little cheeky here, but I wonder though, how the British might take to the cinematic blowing up of Parliarment. Comments anyone? :-)"
"lewiskendell","6","1","6","13 March 2010"," A good movie, made from a great novel.
","Before reading the V for Vendetta graphic novel, I considered the movie version to be excellent. After reading it...well, I still consider it to be a good movie, but I cannot really call it a good adaptation of the book. <br/><br/>I'm not one of those people who automatically considers the film version of any piece of any literature to be inferior by definition. And I realize that there are going to inevitably be some changes in the journey from page to screen. Just because thing are changed, does not mean that those changes have to have a negative impact on the core story. Some things work better on page than film, and vice-versa, and it can be a grave disservice to a story to not make those changes, solely for authenticity's sake. <br/><br/>My only problem with V for Vendetta, is that the changes made to the film version, had a negative impact on the movie. The characters were altered into less complex, whitewashed versions of themselves, and that was difficult to overlook. The plot also differs in a few fundamental ways, with several things being excised from the narrative. I can understand that a 132 minute movie cannot hold every detail of a moderately long novel, but there are some fairly weak additions to the movie that are not nearly as compelling as the material that they replaced. <br/><br/>The occasional focus on action sequences (and the slow-motion that was used liberally within them), I eventually accepted as just one of those inevitable changes, made to appeal to the general movie audience. And as much as I love Cat Power, ""I Found a Reason"" did not fit at all into the scene where it was used. Or the movie, as a whole.   <br/><br/>These will be non-issues for viewers who have no experience with the novel, and I  heartily recommend the movie to those people. But my recommendation is slightly more  cautious to those familiar with the original version of Alan Moore's work. I can't imagine  that your thoughts will differ much from mine, as you watch this.<br/><br/>The actors chosen to play the characters were good choices, for the most part. Sadler,  Creedy, and especially Prothero, all spoke and looked like I imagined a living version of the character would. The rest of the cast was solid, as well. I had no problems with their performances, even when I occasionally had issues with the way their characters were interpreted and written. My sole qualm in this area was with Natalie  Portman, but I couldn't tell if she didn't portray Evey well...or if she did, but the version of Evey that she was given just didn't connect with me.<br/><br/>I care little for the deeper political and philosophical issues that were the heart of the  graphic novel, and I feel the same way about the ones presented in the movie version,  so I won't comment on those things. I enjoyed reading V for Vendetta merely because  it's an excellently told and illustrated story, and enough of that brilliance shines through in  the movie version, for me to give it my approval."
"moviesleuth2","7","1","6","15 June 2008"," Interesting and provocative
","There is no doubt that ""V for Vendetta"" will arouse many questions after viewing, and that's okay, it's a film that deserves to be discussed. It tackles some difficult subjects head on, including, totalitarian regimes, censorship, revolution, terrorism, many of which are especially touchy in today's climate.<br/><br/>Britain has suffered a lot of chaotic tragedies of late, and the government is now headed by Adam Sutler (the wonderfully psychotic John Hurt). This is a totalitarian regime at its most nightmarish (think ""1984""). Now a man who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and a wig (Hugo Weaving) is bringing chaos and terror to Sutler's regime and stirring the seeds of revolution. Helping him, unbeknownst to her at first, is a young woman named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>The acting is terrific. Natalie Portman is solid as Evey, showing vulnerability and determination. Her weakest scenes are the ones where she has to yell and scream a lot, but those are few. Also, she holds a consistent British accent all the way through. Stephen Rea underplays his role, perhaps a little too much. John Hurt has a lot of fun foaming at the mouth all the time, and his presence, mostly from a video screen, commands our attention.<br/><br/>Portman may get top billing for the movie (which is not just because she's the biggest name-she really is the protagonist), but the best performance comes from Hugo Weaving. At times V is a menacing, deadly foe, but at other times, particularly around Evey, he is a sympathetic, human creature. It's a brilliant performance, and Weaving could have used an Oscar nod for it (though he did not get it).<br/><br/>James McTeigue was the protégé of The Wachowski Brothers, who created ""The Matrix"" movies. McTeigue knows what he is doing, and creates his own visual style that emphasizes light and shadow, among other things. It may not be ""Sin City,"" but McTeigue's vision suits the material well.<br/><br/>It's nice to find a movie that is not afraid to ask questions, especially difficult ones. It's great to find one that doesn't dumb it all down. ""V for Vendetta"" will get people talking. Many will disagree with what it has to say. Either way, it's still a great film to see in it's own right."
"SamuelIanBurgess","7","1","6","6 February 2008"," An flawed, imperfect yet highly compelling movie.
","Anyone who has been a fan of 'The Matrix' trilogy will have greeted this film with immense anticipation following said trilogy's conclusion - the Wachowski Bros are renowned for weaving philosophical complexity and nuance perfectly amongst trailblazing, groundbreaking action sequences, and as such 'V For Vendetta' had much to live up to upon release. Expectations were as high as misgivings were plentiful, especially when one considers that Alan Moore, as with every other adaptation of his work, instantly distanced himself from, and denounced, the film. <br/><br/>However, while several of the misgivings Mr. Moore and other strident 'V...' comic book fans (yours truly included) have for the film are largely justified, there is no way that this film can be outright decried - far from it in fact. What we have here is a film that is as enormously engaging as its source material, all the while fluidly adopting an entire life of its own.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of V (Hugo Weaving), no longer the romantic, ruthless anarchist of the graphic novel but a romantic, everyman freedom fighter battling the fascist British regime Norsefire, led by Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) and responsible for the suppression of the public through methods of invasive, pervasive surveillance and the ever-present threat of persecution should they step out of line. In the year covered by the narrative, V takes on the dual goal of exacting revenge upon those who tortured him, disfigured and ultimately created him under government approved experimentations and to bring down the suppressive regime persecuting and suppressing the people of Britain. Along the way, V takes on a protégé of sorts, in the form of young Londoner Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), shaping her and ultimately allowing her to see with her own eyes the beauty in the idealism that V himself represents.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, this is a million miles from the average, run-of-the-mill comic book cash-in, with all intelligent points requiring cognitive thought removed. While 'V...' differs enormously from its source material it remains an enormously compelling work, tapping effectively into modern fears of encroaching totalitarianism with a surprisingly convincing portrayal of Norsefire as an all-pervasive and still exceptionally sinister establishment. The screenplay, will pock-marked with flaws that many fans (particularly British ones) will spot a mile off, none of these are directly consequential to the engaging narrative laid down by the Wachowski Bros.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving's performance is truly extraordinary, given that throughout the entire film we do not once witness his face due to the classic piece of character I.D, the Guy Fawkes mask of the graphic novel. Weaving utilises body language and, crucially, his fantastically articulated voice to convey V's romantic character  his introductory 'V' speech to Evey is a superb piece of enunciation. John Hurt's Sutler is perhaps somewhat underdeveloped, granted a less than satisfactory screen time, but he makes every second his own, oozing menace and threat with every syllable. Portman, on the other hand, is the clear weak link, delivering a dull, trite performance that renders Hammond entirely secondary to V's romantic rampage. The fact that she is the central protagonist is the hardest thing to swallow from the whole movie. However, Weaving and Hurt (not to mention Stephen Rea's deadpan Inspector Finch) more than make up for damage done by Portman, and ultimately it is the bizarrely inspiring acts of mayhem and destruction that V executes (accompanied by a fantastic rendition of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture) that stick in the memory.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this film is guaranteed to disappoint the hardcore comic book fan but, for those who can forgive the Wachowski's for the stark, glaring differences between their work and their source material, 'V For Vendetta' is one of the more potent examples of a political action film  rich in plotting and texture in it's own right and featuring some genuinely memorable performances all round. Certainly, the spat between the Bros. and Alan Moore should not put off the average movie goer; 'V For Vendetta' ticks enough boxes to be worthy of many a viewing."

","This is one of the few movies that is actually close to it's graphic novel and that's not all that's good about this film. Hugo Weaving (The LORD OF THE RINGS & MATRIX Trilogies) uses his voice ( but not his face! ) to convey an anti-hero who, in this case, is actually doing the world a favor. John Hurt (1984) is no stranger to this sort of science fiction tale and never let's his acting go over the top. Natalie Portman (LEON THE PROFESSIONAL) shows that she can act and was merely ""drifting"" through all the STAR WARS Prequels so she could act in a more serious role here. <br/><br/>The set design is perfect, the action sequences aren't the only highlight, politics up for discussion are talked about again & again. Last of all, I personally think this movie is better than it's source material. It's a shame that author Alan Moore didn't agree because this movie is far better than the last couple of adaptations concerning his comics ( CONSTANTINE anyone? ).<br/><br/>Recommended for fans of Action, SciFi, and political movies."

","Where to start? Hitler as villain, that's been done. Totalitarianism bad - gee, that's been done, done, and done. A comic book hero, who can't be killed, yeah, been done too. Gee, let's see, how about knives versus guns, and guess who wins? So you've read Hugh Weaving is wearing this mask. Yeah, that's not so bad. Natalie Portman, she's passable. Stephen Rea, as the policeman assigned to the case, is the real star of the movie. He seems to be about the only decent actor really acting in the film, actually trying to get to the bottom of the case. But it's the plot, which is so tedious, tired, been done, and done and done. I just went back to see the trailer, on-line - why was I thinking this would be a great movie? Because the trailer is good. Hell, the trailer is great.<br/><br/>But I found myself sitting in the theater, looking at the walls, looking down the row I was in. Just plain bored. News flash to Alan Moore and the Wachowskis - a Sinead O'Connor haircut, a sack cloth, gruel to eat, and deprivation do not equal torture. You'll sit there and say, wait, they're not doing anything to Natalie Portman, so what's going on. OH, wait, it turns out that V has captured her, and done all this, to break her spirit, to set her free? COME ON.<br/><br/>Comics are OK. But don't we think that the guys, er nerds, that write these never got laid; instead they cooked up these wild fantasies about super heroes and women that needed to be saved, in lieu of actually having a life, and getting to know girls. Guess that's true for film makers too.<br/><br/>There's no real message here, though there pretends to be one. Not one that you can use. How can you make an anti-establishment movie, that is nothing but establishment. Let's face it. This is a twenty-five year old rant against Margaret Thatcher  but here in the US, we've selected Bush, so what's the Big Deal. Life goes on. We can still make and distribute shitty movies about Hitler-Thatcher-Bush, and the planet still spins on its axis.<br/><br/>I guess I do struggle with the comics in general, and their movie adaptations. I hated Sin City at first, because it was so cartoonish, and over the top. But it was visually stunning, well crafted, and on a second viewing I really liked. So, to further appreciate V, I read the Graphic Novel. It's not that great. It's a comic, with all that that entails. Cartoonish characters and story. I say, with some conviction, that the novel is no better than the movie.<br/><br/>Sure go see it. If you aren't looking for depth, if you don't care about seeing more conventional story arcs, if cartoon bullies in a cartoon movie sound like fun, then strap-on your own mask, and see V. I salvaged this movie week, by watching ""Brazil"" (1985), by Terry Gilliam. Now there's a movie that sings - that marries the horror of a totalitarian state, with reality, with fantasy, with a love story - and it WORKS.<br/><br/>3 out of 10"

This is a powerful warning to all about the road we're heading down, and hopefully will become a call to action if things ever get this bad.<br/><br/>From a film-making point of view, I'm sure I could pick a few things apart, and that's the only reason I knocked a star off. But the message is too important to miss over some quibbles. I'm astounded that a first time director pulled something off this good...he's one to watch.<br/><br/>One more thing...I've never read the graphic novel, and would have never heard of it before if it hadn't been mentioned in a Pop Will Eat Itself song. I understand many (including the author) have complained that the film strayed too far from the book. Well, it's quite clear the film has been updated to reflect the current political climate-and therein lies it's power. I doubt I would have been this enthusiastic about a parable about Margret Thatcher. I'm sure there would still be a strong message, but this is very much a film for 2006, not 1986. I can't say whether the spirit of the original is intact, but it doesn't take anything away from the fact that this is an amazing film.<br/><br/>Thank goodness we still have the freedoms to get something this potentially ""dangerous"" into wide release."
"rdh_gh","10","1","6","18 March 2006"," Great movie with a great message
","Anyone who goes to see ""V"" without the understanding that there is a basic underlying political theme will be disappointed in it. As a conservative, I do not agree entirely with some of what the movie implied. However, the main point of the movie transcends political points of view. Anyone who wants to see a movie that actually has an intriguing plot, that will make you think about what you are seeing and question what you actually believe, will enjoy taking the time to watch this movie and then taking the time to think about it. In the end, when Natalie Portman talks about how V was really everyone, and everyone in London turns out to see the destruction V promised and the start of a new government, this movies full force finally hits. All throughout the movie, there are many ethical questions being raised, such as ""Is terrorism okay when dealing with a corrupt government?"" In the end, the movie really gives a strong message, that everyone must consider what is being done and be willing to fight against something that is corrupt and stand up for what they believe in. This movie is more about making people think while enjoying a great action movie than showing tons of blood, guts, and sex. So if you want to see a movie and think about what you see for awhile, ""V"" is great. Otherwise, just go rent Rambo or Predator to fulfill your need for carnage, because ""V"" is about something more."

","Outstanding cinematics, rich plot that only thickens, direct parallels to the current political and military situation in the US and its protofascist bent conveying subtle implication regarding governmental involvement underlying 9/11. Provocative and clearly the best film release this year. A well-written melodramatic and suspenseful thriller to be seen again with a follow-up DVD purchase to ensure one catches all the allegory, symbolism, contemporary cultural meaning and hidden goodies all of us serious movie-goers enjoy and love. Great how the protagonist's visual identity remained unknown adhering to maximum symbolic effect created by the ever-present mask thus driving the film's idealistic objectives home. V comprehensively reaps the benefits of knowing his predictable enemy well. For those with a knack for serious literature, this one keeps one poised and guessing as it reminds us how one person can still effect true change in a cold, calculating and oppressive world; although that person is cold and calculating in nature as well. Punishing retaliation handled with sophisticated finesse yet telling of the emptiness wrought by the bitter taste of patient revenge. The only weak point is perhaps the seemingly conflicting mixture of comedic understatement with hyperbole that seems to reduce intended impact in some individual scenes, but maybe that's just British dry sense of humor. No real prequel to review before watching but any version of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" can be considered appropriate and applicable preparatory material."

It's such a refreshing change from all these other rehashed remakes and movies with thoroughly exhausted plots. The clever, often fast paced dialogue only adds to the intelligence of the storyline.<br/><br/>The special effects are FANTASTIC: gigantic explosions *particularly that of the Parliment building at the end* intricate fireworks, the action sequences...excellent.<br/><br/>The acting...wow. Natalie Portman expresses entire octaves of emotion.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving is phenomenal as the sophisticated yet terroristic antihero V. *I'm glad I couldn't see his face through the movie...I would have been chanting ""Mr. Anderson"" through the whole thing!* As for John Hurt, he's a futuristic Caligula *see ""I, Claudius"" for details* all over again. In other words, awesome as the fascist dictator *oddly reminiscent of George Orwell's ""1984""...hmmm* And all the other actors who's names I'm not familiar with...awesome. Totally awesome.<br/><br/>The only reason that I didn't give this a 10/10 is because during the movie, I was constantly asking ""Ok, now what exactly is going on?"".

A bit of thinking clears up confusing points with ease.<br/><br/>I would advise seeing it on the big screen: don't wait to rent it on Pay-per-View or what it on HBO.

It operates on many levels, not the least of which is in exposing the tendency of government to corruption and the enslavement of the populace through fear manipulation (using the media as their accomplice). One cannot help but compare current events in light of the movie's story line, and the similarities are unsettling to say the least. The relationship between V and Natalie Portman also weaves its way through the movie, and one can feel the compelling way that V intertwines himself and his ideology through Evie... a spectacular film, one that also serves a valuable service as a mirror to our culture's current headlong trend toward ""security at any price"" ...Long live V!!!"

Unlike the 'The Matrix"", here we mostly rely on the story to drive the movie, and that it does beautifully. The story is complex, deep and perhaps even convoluted the first go around. But upon further viewing, which trust me you will be moved to do many times over, it will become all the more clear.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, with Natalie Portman delivering a thrilling performance. I really love Stephen Rea in this movie, as well as john Hurt. Everyone had their characters perfect. Not one weak performance in the whole movie. Hugo Weaving takes the cake as ""V"", a role where he embodied pain, insanity, yet a clear heroic image. Mind you this is based on a graphic novel, but the story could fool some into believing it's not. The action shots are definitely Matrix-styled, but they don't feel out of context what so ever. Why? Because there's such an emotional build up to them.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Adrian Bidle did his job well, with exhilarating shots that will amaze you, R.I.P. Dario Marianelli's score is moving and it helps the movie really flow quite nicely.

It's interesting, but the tone and atmosphere of the movie is too cartoony and in Hollywood style, and hence it tends to become the usual superhero story instead of something more as it wants to.

"neil-476","9","1","7","17 July 2010"," Powerful
","V For Vendetta was a powerful comic, and it is a powerful movie. There are a number of ways in which it has been changed for the screen - it has been simplified a great deal, with layers and characters stripped away - but the thrust remains the same.<br/><br/>One of the things which entertained me about the film was that, in many ways it remained true to the vibe of the original, but that it resonated as a comment on then current politics (ie. Blair's Labour government as opposed to Thatcher's Conservative government which was the target of Moore's comic) - British, at any rate - with a government which increasingly seeks to control what the population is allowed to do (an article in the UK papers at the time of the movie's release tells us that civic authorities are secretly installing electronic bugs in refuse bins which can be read by the garbage trucks, and which will tally evidence on what individual households are throwing away, enabling non-recycling penalties to be applied). <br/><br/>Despite Moore's left-wing polemic, the dramatic thrust of the piece remains undisturbed when the target is an authoritarian left-wing government rather than a right-wing one.<br/><br/>The main changes were: <br/><br/>1. Dietrich (Stephen Fry's character) wasn't in the book at all; <br/><br/>2. Evey's backstory was different; the involvement of her parents gave her motive for joining V; <br/><br/>3. In the book, Evey didn't use the Lilliman paedophile setup as a way to escape V (I thought the film was an improvement here); <br/><br/>4. There were a lot of minor subplots from the book which were omitted - the incomprehensible Glaswegian psychopath, for instance; <br/><br/>5. The ending differed - in the film it wasn't entirely clear whether Evey had taken on the mantle of V. Plus in the book, there was no public uprising (a good film moment).<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving's voice work is superb. Natalie Portman is excellent, although her accent lands haphazardly in the Home Counties, the East End, and the middle of the Atlantic at different times. The supporting cast is excellent, with Stephen Fry doing particularly well.<br/><br/>A unique comic becomes a most unusual, exciting, and somewhat thought-provoking film."
"AllabtMovies","10","1","7","26 November 2009"," Visionary presentation of a disturbingly dark comic series
","Let me begin with this, ""I own this DVD, watched is over 500 times and will do that again n again"".<br/><br/>I've read the comic series and frankly speaking, while making a movie adaptation of something so sinisterous and gut wrenching tale of revenge and hope for change, one has to take an approach of moderation. So when I read the comments of movie being crap, I wish people would understand that movies like this one are made on a budget which needs to be recovered plus a profit. So if one is able to preserve the soul of original source, the job is a job well done.<br/><br/>I adore Hugo Weaving, right from the Matrix Trilogy. But how could I have expected him to showcase his emotions like anger and regret behind a mask. Ah but the voice, I could see right through that Fawkesian mask, every word, every sigh, every cry, I could identify with the character. By moderating the tactics from the comic books, V was made more human, prompting a hope that someone someday is capable of making a change. The enigmatic portray of his psyche did not call for his amazing fighting skills, but as he'd say, words will always retain their power. I remember the scene when the true nature of Evey's ordeal is revealed to her thereby releasing her anger, V's explosive reaction, if I may call it and then subsiding, soothing embrace, again through his words kept me thinking all night after I first watched it. I couldn't ask for more from Mr. Weaving.<br/><br/>I never really noticed the petite girl in a few movies I saw that of Natalie Portman, but I can sincerely insist that after Léon, this is her best work so far. Her transformation from a scared commoner to a person who realises self dignity and more importantly, finds that she's willing to take responsibility is amazing. I could see her doubt regarding V's plan while having her breakfast in her eyes, yet, I couldn't identify if they belonged to the same person when I saw her in that prison cell or when she bids farewell to V. The beauty of a torn spirit so mercifully woven together by a harsh methodology brings to my attention that sometimes we have to give into pain and suffering, to understand what we value the most. There are no happy endings, but I wished, just for once, that they had one.<br/><br/>As for other characters, I guess Stephen Rea did complete justice with what could have been expected while Tim Pigott-Smith enticed us with his disgusting portrayal of a selfish official and plotter.<br/><br/>A genuine masterpiece ...."

","""Are you like...a crazy person?"" - Evey<br/><br/>""I'm quite sure they'll say so."" - V <br/><br/>Taking place in 2038 and set in a totalitarian-ruled London, ""V For Vendetta"" centers around its title character, the masked anarchist known only as V (Hugo Weaving) and his efforts to take down the dictatorship of Adam Sutler (John Hurt). Based on a graphic novel written by Alan Moore (Watchmen, From Hell), but ultimately revamped from its original story by the Wachowski Brothers (""The Matrix"" trilogy), ""V For Vendetta"" is both smart and highly stylized. The film takes many liberties with its source material, adjusting Alan Moore's original vision to suit modern times. To say ""V For Vendetta"" is a parable for the political landscape of the Bush-era would be ultimately accurate.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman stars as the TV-reporter turned sympathizer when the mysterious V comes to her rescue, while simultaneously introducing her to his (under)world, but it is Hugo Weaving behind the mask who really brings the movie to life. Wearing a black cloak and a Guy Fawkes mask, there isn't much room for expression, but Weaving manages to be both sublime and intense in his role. What could verge on over-acting in any other actor's hands is instead iconic in Weaving's portrayal. Portman is also great, as are John Hurt and Stephen Fry -- playing another of V's allies in the role of a talk-show host -- but ultimately the film gives way to V and his vendetta. Its message may sag and it may get hidden beneath all the spectacular stunts and explosions, but a story that ultimately centers itself on inner strength and the will to fight oppression emerges. It may not be in line with Moore's original vision (Moore subsequently dis-owned the flick) but is suited for modern times. Directed by John McTeigue (who served as assistant director on ""Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones"" and all three ""Matrix"" films), its got an abundance of shocking and memorable visuals, as well as stunts galore. Thankfully, it has just as much brain as it has brawn, and while being uneven at times, still remains relevant. As far as comic book adaptations go, this one belongs at the top of the pile."

The role of V was very well played out and the voice suited the lines. He was dark and alluring even from underneath the mask. Natalie Portman fit her character very well in the beginning, but I found her transformation to be incomplete. She's good at playing simple wholesome emotions, but falls short where subtlety is required. To me she's like a northern version of Jessica Alba. Both are incredibly beautiful and incredibly bland.

","If propaganda is gong to have any effect at all, it works best when it's dropped unexpectedly in your lap.<br/><br/>The makers and marketers of this movie wisely never hinted in pre-release or on its DVD cover about it's far-left, bash America, old-Europe, dirge-style fantasy.<br/><br/>Many times as the script unfolded, I found myself saying, ""I've seen that bumper sticker!"" The brothers covered all the over-used and tired visuals - the ""colonies"" are deservedly doomed, global abuse of terrorists in American prison camps, the victims of terrorism had it coming, conservatives want to kill children, America is confiscating Korans...They even got to shoot their version of a conservative in the face at the end of the movie. (Hurrah! Let's have tea!) All the same genius can be seen on display on skateboards and in tattoo parlors at fraction of the production cost.<br/><br/>If you make a political propaganda film you should be judged on that basis. This is the left's view of the world and with the exception of Natalie Porter in a Little Bo Peep outfit, it's a dark and unapproachable place. The movie is pseudo-intellectual fantasy set in a world that presupposes that the lies of the left about America, terrorism and themselves are true. What a dark and predictable film. What dark, pessimistic souls."

","This has to rank as one of the most grotesque abominations ever shot and released. Ill-conceived, childish, puerile, and likely only to appeal to those whose understanding of politics is at best simplistic, and to those who think terrorism is fun, and nihilism a way forward. Quite aside from some of the worst dialogue, set design and acting in the history of cinema, this characterless film will deeply offend anyone who thinks death and slaughter is not a way to solve the problems of the world. Natalie Portman - usually beguiling and powerful - is awkward and silly, helped only by the fact that everyone around her is even worse. Made without style or intelligence, this movie is a complete and utter embarrassment - no wonder the main character never wants to take the mask off. Offensively childish."

Not '1984.'<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving stars in a climactic duel in which an invincible revolutionary annihilates faceless stormtroopers in a graceful, slow-motion kung-fu dance of bullet-time choreography.<br/><br/>'Matrix?' Guess again.<br/><br/>A comely young maiden develops feelings for a murderous Gothic fruitcake in a mask.<br/><br/>'Phantom of the Opera?' Nay!<br/><br/>A man is wronged horribly and sets out to even the score through extreme cleverness and cartoonish violence.<br/><br/>Batman? The Punisher? Spiderman? The Crow?<br/><br/>No, no, no and no.<br/><br/>You could say 'V for Vendetta,' the latest offering from the Wachowski boys is derivative. But that'd probably be an insult to derivation.<br/><br/>Okay, well, maybe it's got something insightful to say about politics. You hardly ever get that in the movies these days. I mean you've got to hand it to filmmakers with the nerve, in this day and age, to develop a sympathetic hero who espouses demolition as political commentary.<br/><br/>Set in a Great Britain of an indeterminate near future, the film poses a rather unlikely protagonist: 'V,' who wears a Guy Fawkes mask and never removes it -- even when he's making breakfast. <br/><br/>V's mad and we're never quite sure why. Granted, anyone would be homicidally angry if they had to live in a world in which the government uses the media to lie and distract us from real problems.<br/><br/>Okay, wait. Bad example.<br/><br/>What if the government was really, really bad. What if they sent people off to gulags for being gay, or reading the Koran, or satirizing the president? And what if no blog was powerful enough to stop it?<br/><br/>Yeah, okay, that'd blow. What's the plan, V? Encourage citizens to be politically active? To get up off their behinds and vote for a change? Turn the TV off and hand out fliers for an hour or two down at the train station?<br/><br/>V: ""Well, no actually, I thought I'd dynamite a few baroque old buildings of immeasurable historical significance. Then maybe I'll stab some folks.""<br/><br/>Hmm. Well, I suppose that's one way to go.<br/><br/>'V' stands less frequently in this film for 'vendetta' as it does for 'vascillation.' Is it a revenge plot with political undertones? Or is it a political plot with revenge undertones? Whatever seems to lend credence to any given scene, apparently.<br/><br/>As best as anyone might put together through the flashback scenes, V was some poor slob who got caught in the middle of some incestuous collusion between a pharmaceutical company and the government.<br/><br/>This I can buy. Hell, it's happened to my grandfather thanks to this idiotic Medicare drug plan.<br/><br/>Anyway, V got sick or something and was used as a human lab rat or maybe that was how he got sick and it's never quite clear how he came to find himself sick and imprisoned and ultimately, a burned-up mutant. Conveniently, nearly every person we meet who was involved in the trickery that made him a freak occupies a position of supreme power in a new British plutocracy: the president himself; the head of the church; and a popular Bill O'Reillyesque TV personality. Heck, two of these big-shots used to work at the very government installation where V became a burned-up mutant! So rubbing them out is not only good for Mr. V's personal sense of justice, but for the commonwealth as well.<br/><br/>Methinks not.<br/><br/>And as a measure of V's capacity to justify poisoning old ladies in their sleep, we meet Evey. V's unwitting and often unwilling partner in crime, Evey seems to exist so V's got someone to educate in the hard realities of politics, government, and hypocrisy. Not wholly sophomoric, these lessons include a short journey into the kind of hell millions must have suffered at the hands of the KGB and other totalitarian agencies -- a hell in which political prisoners are held interminably and pumped for information.<br/><br/>Good thing America doesn't do stuff like that.<br/><br/>Evey is played by Natalie Portman, still proving an acting career can be built on being extremely cute. She phones in yet another doe-eyed every-girl but manages almost to be interesting when she gets her head shaved.<br/><br/>In a laughably implausible conclusion, we are asked to believe that a British police detective, upon discovery of a plot to level Big Ben, would stand there and let some punk rock chick throw the switch on the advice of some bozo in a mask. No. Even, or perhaps especially if the detective had just uncovered a cabal of government and commercial collusion. Police detectives just don't do things like that. Ever.<br/><br/>And lastly, we are invited to believe that the populace of London could be won over to the side of a weirdo resembling a walking marionette. That they would do so after viewing a frightening political manifesto televised by said weirdo. And that they would express their allegiance to this weirdo by dressing up like him and marching downtown to watch one of their most beloved historical landmarks explode. If Timothy McVeigh had somehow convinced us all that the UN was going to take away our bibles, I still very much doubt we would have felt compelled to put on Timothy McVeigh masks, march down to D.C., and watch him tip over the Washington monument. Populaces just don't do things like that. Ever.<br/><br/>So what have you got. An often depressingly violent revenge picture mixed in with a lot of wrong-headed and sophomoric political wisdom all tossed into a shop-worn vigilante genre.<br/><br/>'V' is for wait for the DVD."

I actually liked matrix but this film is revolting in its leftist view of the world.<br/><br/>Our men and women are fighting terrorists and helping innocent civilians but getting left wing garbage thrown at them by socialist Hollywood. This fits right in with Fahrenheit 911, but it is slickly packaged to appeal to that average movie goer.<br/><br/>I am also disappointed by Natalie Portman choosing this film to appear in. There have been a number of decent films that have slipped through the cracks this last year like Cinderella man, The Great Raid, Ringer, Dreamer, even Hills have Eyes had some good qualities for a cheap film. Portman chooses this socialist ""Vendetta."" She plays it like a zombie. The film is also needlessly violent loving to show blood splattering everywhere. The final cruel moment when Big Ben and parliament explodes turning to fireworks is ultimate low point in film history. In real life right now reporters are being raped and tortured by the terrorists while families still mourn the murder of children in school buses and hostages being beheaded. The most recent was when a man went to mourn his dead baby and a filthy terrorist placed a bomb inside the dead child killing the people at the funeral. Villages all over are being controlled by vicious thug terrorists and idiot Hollywood is siding with the slime terrorists. I give the film high rating because it unintentionally reveals itself and other films as pure brainwashing. This film can only be appreciated by the gullible. What has happened?"

","After leaving this movie it was very hard to find my thoughts. I think the best way to describe my feelings was underwhelmed. I am huge fan of the matrix series, so that is why i went to see the movie. I did not expect it to be nearly as good as the matrix because what can be. I do not understand what the big buzz surrounding this movie is. It was very slow to where I had to check my watch a few times in the movie. While other people left the matrix discussing the action sequences and visual effects, I left discussing the theory and mystery behind the movie. After V, I left confused and indifferent. I am not an action guy at all, but that is the only thing that kept me going throughout the movie.<br/><br/>My particular complaints are: I wish they would have shown more concrete background of why society was like it was. It seemed as though they tried to present clever theory about it but never explained it. It was like my old basketball coach used to say ""Too much shake n back and not enough chicken.""<br/><br/>I went into the movie hearing it was anti-Bush and I am pretty good at turning that off in movies and seeing beyond that in the movie. This movie was like trying to take every jab it could. If it wasn't enough with the anti-government one liners and the instilling fear into people discussion, they had to go on and on about homosexuals which was an obvious shot at this administration trying to pass certain laws about marriage. My opinion on the situation does not even matter, but at a certain point it was like 'give me a break.'<br/><br/>I understand the story took place in a graphic novel, but it was still very ridiculous. The ending was just dumb. It seemed as though the theories were developed before the plot and the Wachowskis had to come up with 2 hours of junk to shove these ideas down our throat. Lastly, the character of V was just boring and annoying. I did not expect batman or superman, but this guy was just ridiculous. He tried to make a bunch of points that just did not hit home. I understand 'he was me, you, your dentist and everyone else' which was just another attempt at sounding clever that just missed the mark.<br/><br/>Go see it for yourself and realize how boring and dumb it was. I had heard so much about it being thought provoking, but i left the movie theatre thoughtless and underwhelmed."

","People say American Pie is this generations Porky's. People say that Old School is this generations Animal House. If these are true then V For Vendetta is this generations A Clockwork Orange. By saying that I don't mean that we see people running around in long johns, and Derby hats raping women and beating people to death. It's just going to get that type of cult following. Some people might be turned off by the subliminal Bush bashing message hidden with in the film (After all it got the very attractive Natalie Portman, who is a very political activist to shave her head for the role of Evy) but other people will just enjoy the movie for what it is. Very entertaining. Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel, written about 20 years ago, V For Vendetta takes place in a futuristic London. Now by futuristic I don't mean flying cars and Jetson's type technology. The world of tomorrow in this film looks like the world of today. This London is run by a dictator of a man played by John Hurt. He tells people how they should, and will leave. We then meet Evy (Natalie Portman, Star Wars) who is caught by 'Fingermen"" (The government agents of London) because she is out past curfew. When she screams for help because the fingermen are going to have her do them ""favors"" for not getting in trouble, we then meet our hero V (Hugo Weaving, The Matrix, and Lord Of The Rings Trilogies). Now V isn't like your typical hero. He wears all black, has a pointy pilgrim hat and hides his face behind a mask that reminds me of The Joker. V seems borderline insane and Evy doesn't know exactly what to make of her strange knight in shining armor. Before she knows it, Evy has been dragged into V's one man war against the government. His modo is ""People should not be afraid of their government, government's should be afraid of their people. V For Vendetta will not cater to everyone (I did see this film with my wife, who hated it, and my two friends who liked it) but it will become a cult classic in the same vein as Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. People that have read Moore's brilliant graphic novel will love it as most of the film is scene for scene, word for word just like the book. Although Moore hated this film so much he did not want his name in the credits, which makes me wonder why? This was a far better adaptation than his last story come to life The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen. I admit I was nervous when I heard The Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix Trilogy) had wrote this film because while The Matrix was amazing, the follow up's were something to be desired for. Looks like they found what they were missing when they wrote Matrix 2 and 3. V For Vendetta is rated R for violence and language. On a scale of 10 I give V For Vendetta a 10."

","Pure genius. This movie had the best of everything a movie should have. Great story, fantasy elements, unbelievable fight scenes, and the coolest character since Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving, in my opinion, has finally gotten the role to define his career. Acting with a mask that hinders emotion and expression, it actually excels the role. Such awesome lines that he delivered would have not been as powerful had he put his (I would say) trademark eyebrows to work. His performance was the best I have ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman more than redeemed herself for the Star Wars Prequels. Though her accent was, at times, hard to believe to be natural, she did pretty good.<br/><br/>John Hurt was the Shiznit. The perfect example of how a tyrant is. Angry at criticism, weak at death. Best dictator on film.<br/><br/>The movie taught me an important lesson. Everything is based on a point of view. To V, vengeance and destruction are the only way to defeat an evil power. To the evil powers, V is a terrorist hell-bent on disrupting the peace. To Valerie, for instance, she believed that love should not be limited to only one type whereas the government believed that it was disgusting and destroying society. There are two sides to every story and though there might be a right or wrong side to it, everyone believes in something and that belief is worth fighting for.<br/><br/>By the way, I know that many will disagree with me, but this was a great movie. It's going to get snubbed by the Oscars because it was too entertaining and action packed in a non-artistic or dramatic way like Lord of the Rings was."

","""V"" is a movie, politically speaking, whose time has come, as I was reminded last week when Feingold stood up to censure the president for surveillance of Americans and nobody stood with him. Philosophically, this movie is about the spread of an idea. A pure idea as indicated by the fact that Evie (Natalie Portman) never looks beneath ""V""'s mask. With elements of ""Phantom of the Opera"" we know that there is an ugly facade beneath the mask, but the revealing of his face has not do to with fear. Fear is demonstrated as the bondage that enslaves society and in this future world, New Britain, the government has learned to use fear as their perfect tool. The absence of fear is freedom, and this is the pure idea which the film seeks to spread. <br/><br/>This is a deeply-affecting, multi-dimensional movie, thoroughly thought-provoking while marvelously entertaining.<br/><br/>Favorite ringers : While pondering keeping the masses controlled with the threatened assault on the Parliament, amidst other subtle references to 911.. ""It's going to take more than a building to hold us together.""<br/><br/>A news reporter, showing the press's dereliction of their duty, says something to the effect of, ""I just report the lies, government fabricates them.""<br/><br/>In discovering the origins of ""V"" in a government secret anti-viral experiment, the film's only recalled appearance of a black man receiving an injection reminds us of our own nefarious ""Tuskeegee experiments"" where unsuspecting Mississippi blacks were given lethal doses of syphilis.<br/><br/>As the vendetta's last victim accepts the welcome retribution of death she wonders, ""Is it meaningless to apologize ?.."" ""Never,"" says ""V."" (That's good moral stuff, kiddies.)<br/><br/>A portrayal of the metaphysical notion that no one but ourselves can truly liberate or enslave us is delivered as Evie simply walks out of her cell,away from the torturers to return to ""V""'s comfortable lair behind an unguarded door. (His house is a museum, like the Addams fam-i-ly.)<br/><br/>And finding that ""V"" himself was her torturer, can we think of him as a hero ? The answer to this movie moment is your answer to one of the movies central themes, ""Does the ends justify the means ?""<br/><br/>Natalie Portman deserves an Oscar nomination."

However, the production is both propelled and impaired by the Wachowski Brothers' influence - the stylized violence, which was very well choreographed and shot, is bound to be campy in a few years' time and the dramatic storyline is carried too much by actors with the same serious deadpan British dialogue (hearing just audio, I doubt I'd be able to identify the voices to the actors, which for some reason just bothers me.)

It's a hymn to beauty and truth, supreme against the tyranny of image, politic and power. For anyone who knows they have a soul, and needs it lifting a good hundred steps higher at the end of a long day, bung it in the DVD player and be driven to a higher, better, more hopeful, joyful place.<br/><br/>Just try not to mind the slight twee-ness of the ending (all those people in masks!)"

If you are watching and went ""What?"" you wouldn't be alone, but I believe that you have to watch it again in order for the full plot to sink in to the viewer. The story line is based on Guy Fawkes Night. At first I was forced into watching it but I later started liking it more for some reason, its not my usual type of films but it was alright.<br/><br/>If you don't know what that is, search it on the internet and you will start to understand the significance of this film. The mysterious ""V"" played by Hugo Weaving, is a vigilantly that you never fully get told the back story of. It is a hard plot to summarize without ruining it, because although it takes some twists and turns it really only has one plot line. In the middle of the film there is a twist that will grip you further into V's world. There are also many questions that are left unanswered and lest for the viewer to ponder. I urge you to spend some time and think about the movie so that you can gather your own ideas about why certain things happen in the film. The best thing about Vf or Vendetta is that the viewer is left to decide the answers for him or herself.

","In England in the near future there is an oppressive police state. A young woman named Evey is rescued from a vicious attack by a mysterious masked man known only as V. V is a freedom fighter, hell-bent on overthrowing the government; as she begins to understand him, Evey find herself drawn more and more to his cause <br/><br/>This is one of the best comic-book adaptations of recent years, an excellent multi-layered film with a cracking plot, great characters, lots of action and a thought-provoking subtext. You can enjoy it on a simple level as the usual masked avenger story (it has many nods to The Count Of Monte Cristo), but also as an Orwellian nightmare of totalitarian fascism; it seems to me to make specific reference to the UK in the early eighties (strikes, tax riots, inner city turmoil). It's also a great character piece - Portman is the standard apolitical protagonist polemicised by what she sees, complete with a clever Stockholm Syndrome twist - but she makes the transformation seamless and deeply moving, notably when she reads the testimony of the murdered lesbian. Weaving as the suave assassin V himself is sensational; not only does the movie never cheat and reveal his face, it also permits us the scope to decide for ourselves whether he is a heroic freedom fighter or a crazed terrorist. Rea is also excellent as the world weary gumshoe, making a rather routine and dogmatic part into an intelligent, philosophical man. The support cast are all good too, and having Hurt play Big Brother is an amusing twist, since he played Winston Smith in 1984. The film is also shot through with an enjoyable sardonic humour, particularly in V's tongue-twisting alliterative quotations, or the amusing scene where Fry reduces the party-line's top media scare story into a pantomime farce. Scripted by the Wachowski Brothers (of The Matrix fame), based on a comic-book series by David Lloyd and an uncredited Alan Moore. Exceptionally well photographed throughout by Adrian Biddle, one of Britain's most talented cameramen (check out Aliens, The Princess Bride, Event Horizon, and just about anything else by him), who sadly died not long after production. This was his final movie, and it is respectfully dedicated to him. The political action adventure subgenre is a rare niche which often produces some gems (Escape From L.A., Fight Club) and this is no exception. First-rate entertainment."

But there you go  one man comes and says that it's not the right way to live and begins to fight.<br/><br/>I've heard from my parents what it's like to live on the red side of the Berlin's wall. And, of course, I've heard about Nazis. So here you go, you see British people living like Germany seventy years ago. And it's OK to them. But! A masked man (Zoro? Batman?) comes and says NO! to the system. It's heroic but Not true and too true.<br/><br/>The girl, Evey (sound like V, wonder why) doesn't do anything against the system even if it has taken her parents. Until V shows. He opens her eyes and teach not to fear the system. And finally the girl understands who and what is real. Dances, laugh, old movies. Things which are forbidden. People are afraid of the system, but system is more afraid of people's consciousness.<br/><br/>V wakes the people, wakes Evey, but die in the end. This is very heroic. He frees the society and leaves, doesn't become a leader like the one he killed. It's good. The movie is also good. I can't help myself not to think about the country I'm living, Lithuania, twenty years ago. But the movie is really good.<br/><br/>And, just one more rhetorical question.

I think I might have actually enjoyed the outburst if it had been done tongue in cheek. But the writers actually intended us to take it seriously. It was as absurd as the speech by that character, whatever he was called, in the second Matrix. It would have earned a d minus in a college essay. V, I realized sadly after about 20 minutes, was a boring pretentious movie, an attempt at a political message by people who obviously don't have a very good grasp of the subject on which they want to lecture the world.

Natalie Portman does well, but Hugo just steals the show.<br/><br/>There was a bit of comedic lines, but they were very dark and not really that funny.<br/><br/>The action was good, though the last sequence was a bit cheesy(its like bullet-time fighting, but it just doesn't work). People complained by a lack of action, but I felt it had enough action. Maybe one more 1-2min fight scene, but that's about it. The movie was so intense that it didn't really need more action.<br/><br/>The thing that I didn't like about the film was that it started to fall apart on the third act. Everything became WAY too predictable(i mean, sometimes you kind of know how things are going to turn out, but sometimes its just like you know EXACTLY how its going to happened). The film became a typical Hollywood film with a typical Hollywood ending. While it wasn't a bad ending, it just wasn't on-par with the first two acts. And in my opinion, the ending is probably the most important part of a film. I mean, if you can't end the movie right then all the stuff you did before doesn't matter as much.<br/><br/>But overall, it was an amazing, but flawed film. Great acting, great drama, and great action. Could have used a better ending, but not every film is perfect.<br/><br/>8/10"

","What I thought about ""V for Vendetta"" was that it was a real thought provoking film and not just another summer action flick. It is a movie that is driven by themes, characters and a strong plot. The strongest part of the film is the development of the two main characters, Evey and V. Evey goes from a tentative young woman to someone who takes action in what she believes in while V's character is built from flashbacks. The film ties closely around the events of Evey's life from her tragic past to a rough adulthood. You the audience get to feel as she does as you watch her throughout the film. At the end of the film you really get to understand why the characters made the choices they made.<br/><br/>this was a school report"

Like the great Equilibrium, V for Vendetta has a spectacular way of deepness and action.<br/><br/>Natile Portman plays Evy Hammond, a woman living in a futuristic London where nothing is exactly right. One night, she meets a vigilante named V(played by Hugo Weaving), a Shakespearian type talker who is getting revenge against the sick people who ruined his life many years ago. On that night, V takes Evy to Parliment where he blows it up. The two are seen together. And she soon becomes a fugitive. <br/><br/>When V save her from the cops, V takes her and V believes that she could be his ally. But she knows that she would never do it.

"dwpollar","4","1","10","30 September 2009"," Disturbing and complex story...
","1st watched 9/27/2009 – 4 out of 10 (Dir-James McTeigue): Disturbing and complex story about a terrorist/freedom fighter named V who plots to take down a falsifying government of the near future in jolly old England in a setting where the U.S. has tumbled under itself. England is ruled by a dictator similar to ""1984""'s Big Brother(who is played in a weird twist by John Hurt who was the victim in the latest movie version of the book). The character V was one of the subjects of the government's experiments with chemical weapons and was disfigured in a fire when they decided to shut it down but he survived and now wears a mask to cover the burns. He now has vengeance and justice in mind for those who caused the fire and for the government. Natalie Portman's character comes on the scene when she is used by him to get into the nationally controlled television station and make his own announcement. The announcement concerns him celebrating a late freedom's fighters attempt at blowing up parliamant and getting hanged for it on the anniversary of the event. It's amazing how complex this movie is considering it's based on a graphic novel where only the illustrator get's credit.(I'm sure the Wachowski bro's who wrote the screenplay added some things) Overall, the feeling of the movie is that we're supposed to think that violence is the only way to bring down this type of nation. This is truly a disturbing thought, although it might be true. It is an interesting story that brings much thought as to what matters most to your mind when it ends, but it's not that great of a movie. The Wachowski brothers still don't do much for me( I'm maybe one of the few that didn't like their Matrix movies), sorry -- but I have to say things the way I see them."

If it wasn't for Natalie Portman I couldn't have watched this movie in it's entirety. It's a shame she shaved her beautiful head for this movie. It wasn't worth it. There are many holes in the plot. The abilities of the terrorist are never really explained. The bad guys are easy to dislike, but so are the good guys.

"LasperchesMiroir","3","1","10","30 March 2006"," V for Vendetta
","There are many movies (and television programs too for that matter) whose concept sounds intriguing enough to offer promise. ""That sounds like a really great premise, can't wait to see it!"" However, more often than not, from there the piece usually falls flat on its face and ""V for Vendetta"" is no exception.<br/><br/>V is for Vision of the future, and not a good one at that. Over time, freedoms have been taken away from the people of England in order to ensure their own safety, so says the dictator. V is for the Vulpine revolutionary who believes that government should fear the people, not the other way around. And V is for Voice, the one our hero gives to the Victimized Masses.<br/><br/>While the actors deliver believable performances, the characters fail to stir any emotion in the Viewer, sympathy or otherwise, and so you watch the screen not really caring what happens to them one way or the other. The imposing dictator (John Hurt) is always angry, Vehemently spewing forth orders, but he isn't particularly scary. Nor are his henchmen. The society they have created is, if you think about it, but the movie doesn't allow you to do that. It doesn't dwell on what has been lost but focuses more on the upcoming revolt with bland apprehension.<br/><br/>V is for Vague references to curfews and food rationing. Human guinea pigs and elimination of homosexuals are injustices also briefly touched upon, but not with the dramatic affect needed to carry our hero's mission. (I don't think that there is any room for debate that the dictator is the real terrorist and not the revolutionary, so I don't see how promoters are trying to spin this as a controversial film.)<br/><br/>Our masked hero (Hugo Weaving) is elegantly charming and appears knowledgeable. He understands the movement he sets into motion is bigger than himself and that as a symbol (aptly revolutionist Guy Fawkes), rather than a person, the message he brings forth is more effective. (In this regard, it seems here that a page was borrowed from another comic book based movie, ""Batman Begins,"" whereas the whole book should have been copied since that was a more dynamic depiction of a revolutionist rising against a corrupt government). Our hero saves damsel in distress Evey (Natalie Portman), they exchange what is sometimes lively banter, and she eventually comes around to his way of thinking.<br/><br/>Special effects are kept to a minimum and most of them are realistic, nothing overtly screaming CGI, except for one battle scene where homage is unwarrantedly paid to the writers (the Wachowski Brothers) with blades moving in slow motion, a la ""The Matrix,"" but blood from the wounds still spurting at real time. We get that our hero is quick without seeing the swoosh of his knives in the air and the effect feels contrived and campy since its only appearance late in the film lasts merely a minute.<br/><br/>The music suited the film well though, keeping with the mood. And there is always something about Violence set to classical music that makes me snicker, like civility and unrest are two sides of the same coin bound to come together at some point.<br/><br/>But I am Vexed by two implausible happenings in the confine of the plot: (1) Our hero's powerfully superhuman call to his cause when he is anything but superhuman and (2) our damsel's impeccable hygiene while she is a tortured prisoner. Something tells me that when the clothes given to you are barely enough to cover your body and the food is literally not even fit for a rat to eat, that the nice captors aren't going to give you a razor to shave your armpits and legs (not that that would even be on the mind of someone so terrified and wallowing in self-pity that they remain in the fetal position when not being interrogated).<br/><br/>Someone should also talk to the marketing department at Warner Brothers. With so much hinging on the Gunpowder Treason of 1605, you would think that the head honchos would ""Remember, remember, the fifth of November,"" and release the film on the weekend of, especially in the U.K. where the constant reference would have the most potency.<br/><br/>In the end, V is for Vacuum as it sucks away 131 minutes of your life that you'll never get back. If you're smart, you'll leave the theatre seats Vacant as this is the kind of movie you wait to come on cable and watch only if the other 100 plus channels are devoid of good programming."
"JenniferShidal","3","1","11","8 April 2006"," Anti-American, Anti-Christian Propaganda
","I would recommend reading the review by Michael Karounos at Christian Answers (www.christiananswers.net) prior to seeing this movie. Karounos states, ""The movie is preachy to say the least, and harps on three major themes and one minor one: 1) the evil of America; 2) the government control of media; 3) the evil of Christianity; and 4) the innocence of Islam."" I personally went to see the movie without reading any reviews. This movie was not put out for mere entertainment. The director has an obvious political agenda. The visual effects and acting in the movie were decent, but I cannot give it a high rating due to its anti-Christian and Anti-American propaganda."
"Misanthropic_Disease","5","1","12","29 May 2007"," Propaganda, not Vendetta...
","The high rating of this movie by IMDb users clearly defines their amateurism, their weak and basic criticism, their naivety, but especially their lack of philosophical, political and cultural knowledge. Am I starting too hard? Sorry about that, but I believe truth is never pretty, so being 100% honest isn't usually much prettier. But just let me explain the link between these untutored users and the very core of V for Vendetta, wait, I'm coming to it.<br/><br/>I did not liked this movie, because in the contrary of most users, I didn't got caught by the easy choices behind the story and the stereotyped beliefs and behaviors of its characters. Sadly, like always, most peoples did.<br/><br/>Not that this is a surprise for me, but this sure is another reminder of their desperate state of mind, loose and constantly changing values, but especially their empty and so-called ""hope"" (yes, this is a direct insight to the ending), which is only build out of their vanity and very incapacity to admit they can't (and will never be able to) save themselves!<br/><br/>This also means that I'm, indeed, directly comparing them to the citizens of V for Vendetta, who got so easily caught with so little and WITHOUT QUESTIONNING THEMSELVES. <br/><br/>Yes, the movie has a very good design, it also has talented actors. I was especially pleased by the presence of John Hurt and Eddie Marsan. Hugo Weaving had one nasty challenge; to act without showing his face, and I believe he made it just right, the script sure helped to enhance his speech and overall voice performance, but to my opinion, most of the credit goes to him. I've never been a Portman fan, but I liked her in this role. In fact, most of the cast did a wonderful job, honestly. Sound was right, not necessarily memorable though.<br/><br/>But to say the least, most of my attention was kept by the story, its values and themes, its obvious influences and the will of the makers in every choices of the production. Well, and let's say that it's tough to respect them when they use so little subtlety in the translation. I have too much to say on this side, so I'll try to resume as much as possible.<br/><br/>Visually speaking, colors and light are an important part of the personality given to anything or anyone. In the movie, there is darkness almost all the time; it's either dark, indoor or both. Excepted when V makes something explodes, it's always outside, which gives a feeling of freedom, and, in the final scene, the explosion light up every faces of the citizens, to make us feel like they are reaching hope and freedom. Furthermore, those who studied colors, flags, or both, know that the use of either red and black, or red, black and white (especially the last one), is, unconsciously, a threatening arrangement, which usually means hate, war and/or hostility. Of course, in the movie, these colors were the official ones given to the Government, which makes it evil from the very beginning. It also is a direct insight to the Nazi colors of the WWII. But they don't stop there, they makes them corrupted Christians (the bishop who sleep with young girls), rich (at one time, we quickly see a written amount of over 20Millions pounds which seems to be an individual's bank account statement), self centered (the animator takes his shower surrounded by TVs playing his own show...), hypocrite (TV news lies, Sutler who doesn't want the detective to speak about what he read in the book), etc. The Government Symbol (a red cross with two horizontal bars to make a F for Faith) is a good summary of what the story writers wanted to demonise; Christianity. And this is where I don't fall in their trap.<br/><br/>If I'm telling everyone God bless this or that, of if I wear a t-shirt saying ""What would Jesus do?"", does it makes me Christian? If I really need to answer that, then you really disappoint me. We judge someone by his heart and by his actions, not by what he says, what he looks like, or by what someone told you about him. But most of the time, peoples don't follow this way. This is why in the story, the makers wanted the Government to be very immoral and evil, while also defining them as conservators Christians. But if you look closer, nothing of what they are doing of ""evil"" is Christian-related, nothing excepted for one thing; homosexuality. This never-ending subject then takes all the attention, making most peoples finally associate the whole corrupted Government thing to Christianity, and there we go. The Bush ambiguity, as I like to call it, also doesn't help to defines peoples minds on the subject, and peoples get easily caught in this ""Christian = bad"" thing.<br/><br/>And talking homosexuality, this part where Evey finds a girl's kind of biography written on toilet paper is really pathetic, to my opinion. Furthermore, it revealed an important hidden plot that made this movie less credible and hypocritical to my eyes. Especially because if his creators would have been confident enough on that subject, they would have replaced Portman's character by a man, or V by a woman, but they did not, and it speaks for itself.<br/><br/>Finally, if you ask me, this is a big disappointment from the Watchowski brothers, we will very quickly forget this one... I hope they'll make something more astonishing next time. Also, anyone searching a little bit will easily find two precise subjects, which really sounds like a propaganda in favor of homosexuality and against Christian-inspired governments, if not Christianity itself! Which is not subtle and kind of annoying."

For real I can not see why, for the changes to the characters ,story and some events every adaptation of a literature work has those ,but we don't see the guys who wrote X- men: Days of Future Past wine abouts it.<br/><br/>Any way the film as it stand is amazing and the political commentary it makes to the Post Nine Eleven world we live in ,makes it still on the point even a decade after its release. So the story centers to a post crisis stricken United Kingdom in which a totalitarian regime has rose and propaganda ,fear and lack of freedom in general is the norm and we follow our ,in sense, the main point of view character Eve, who meets on fifth of November V, a vigilante dead set to raise the government to the ground with any mean if need it. So as the story progress we witness Eve coming in to her out and a revolution movement happening.<br/><br/>The theme of the film is sum up by the man in the Guy Fox mask himself: ""The shouldn't be afraid of the government ,but the government of the people"".It sounds a bit easy to understand ,but the meaning applies and to the real world as well. The governments shouldn't keep secrets from the citizen who vote for them nor spy on the in the name of security and we all know these were true then and true now. So ,fine it changed in order to fit better the time of its making, just like the original was made to criticize the Thacher type of government in the eighties, where is the problem ,both adaptation hit the authority where was deed it at the time.<br/><br/>In the end ,Alan Moore maybe has created many amazing comic book run and graphic novels ,but in these case was an asshole and the flick rocks.

","V for Very Average. That's putting it nicely. It's actually pretty bad at some spots. Natalie Portman's acting was so annoying and over the top, I felt like she just walked out of a high school play (I respect her and like her talent, but wow was she bad in this). But that's just one aspect that was contrived.<br/><br/>While it isn't one of the worst movies ever made and is even half decent in all, this film is not very good. First of all, it's cheesy. That's a rarity to say. Many films aren't so good, but cheese is something that you don't see much from ""acclaimed"" films like this at #150 on the Top 250 on IMDb. It almost makes certain teenagers are voting (let's hope).<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is very ""average"", and nothing more. It's the type of movie if you've seen all the others and are caught up, and it happens to be on basic cable, you take a glance at for a few minutes and change the channel. There's nothing new here. Another masked crusader (not a likable one) who fights crime in a silly looking mask with a weird wig and embarrassingly forms a pseudo romance just for movie goers who need another element of entertainment on date night (because we know the movie didn't have enough depth as it was).<br/><br/>This is the epitome of an average movie. 5/10 is the perfect score for this cheese fest."

","The movie ""V for Vendetta,"" was released in 2005. The movie was written by Andy and Lana Wachowski, based on the graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore and David Lloyd and is directed by James McTeigue. The main characters are V (Hugo Weaving) and Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman). The movie is set in a futuristic Great Britain after the fall of America. The government has taken a strict rule over the people of Great Britain and rule with an iron fist. Times are hard for the people that live here and have to deal with curfews among many other things. V wears a mask with the design of Guy Fawkes, a man that attempted to blow up the parliament, only to fail. V is attempting to start a revolution of the British people by doing things that are considered terrorist acts. On the night that V decides to make his first attempt to spark the revolution he runs into Evey that is being confronted by the special police because she is out after curfew. After saving Evey, V shows her what he is doing and tries to make her his disciple.<br/><br/>The motif of the film is the mask that V wears throughout the movie. It is painted with the design of Guy Fawkes. It stands for the rebellion that is about the happen within Great Britain. At times V uses the masks to disguise him in an escape, and eventually it is the symbol he gives the rebellion. The lighting in the movie is dark. This is to show that the story is set in a very dark point in the history of this country. Also, for the story, the movie is set at night because there are a lot less people out and about due to the curfews that have been put into place.<br/><br/>Another movie that could be considered similar to ""V for Vendetta,"" is ""The Dark Knight,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, based on the DC crime fighter Batman. They are similar because they are both based on graphic novels and instead of fighting crime as a person; they both fight as a symbol. The symbol becomes more than the person they are behind their masks."

"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","2","15 May 2014"," One of the best comic book movies
","""V for Vendetta"" is an adaptation of a graphic novel written by Alan Moore, whose ""Watchmen"" is considered one of the best (if not the very best) in that medium. The movie's literary pedigree supplied it with a solid basis for adaptation. I haven't read the source material myself but it would seem that the filmmakers did not fail to capture what made the original work special.<br/><br/>The story takes place in a near future Britain where tyranny has become the norm under the dictatorial government of the day. However, there is one mysterious individual who plots to overthrow the country's leaders and place control back in the hands of the people. He is aided in his quest by a young woman whose chance encounter with him has put her under close scrutiny by the police. The script by the Wachowskis uses this framework to craft an absorbing story that deftly mixes mystery and action against a thought-provoking backdrop.<br/><br/>The title character, V, was played by Hugo Weaving but we never see his face during the entire film, so he had to rely on his distinctive voice to convey the emotion behind the mask. Overall, he did a good job. Female lead Natalie Portman also contributed a solid performance, though I can't help but think that a British actress would have been better suited to the role. Speaking of British thespians, the supporting cast includes an enviable trio of them - John Hurt, Stephen Rea & Stephen Fry.<br/><br/>First time director James McTeigue apparently learned a lot from his work as first A.D. on the Matrix films. He shows a sure hand throughout, whether in frenetic action sequences or more intimate scenes. The cinematography of Adrian Biddle is also a key element in the attractive visuals and the musical selections are well chosen, too.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I feel that the movie shows attention to detail in all areas but I'm not completely sold on all aspects of the plot, particularly when it comes to Evey's incarceration. That being said, the movie is still much more satisfying (on multiple levels) than most comic book adaptations. It's definitely worth watching, whether you're a comic book fan or not."

Although this is part of story, it's something I can't ignore considering every time I watch it I end up having many long sighs over these scenes. b) Some of the action scenes (the ending, in particular) ended look a bit cheap.

","a dream where believing in people's power can defeat their fear. this is how revolutions r born. acting here is not the cornerstone ,however the idea in the story is the core of the movie. the movie is in dead a textbook for revolution of the people against fear from the authority. how can the carious make an order act like what happened in the movie > the act is good. the other idea that make the movie one of my most favorite movies is the idea that loosing every thing liberates u from all fear though nothing can defeat you because simply they will take nothing from you . the movie is simple but amazing. maybe not super famous actors but the idea was simply delivered to the audience."

","Hmmm, I'm not too sure what I fully thought of this one. It's definitely a provocative and interesting movie, but unlike any comic book movie I've ever seen. I appreciated its originality and authenticity. It's a fantastic visual experience, and heavily stylized. It also had me thinking about it after it was over, so that means it was a very effective movie. I wouldn't exactly say I enjoyed it though. It's a bit too heavy-handed and dark for my liking. The leads are not your typical heroes either. They are very much the definition of anti-heroes. Hugo Weaving is not exactly very sympathetic as V. He does things a hero shouldn't do, and that's what made him so fascinating. He is filled with regret, remorse, and pain. His chemistry with Portman is what really made this movie. Weaving was excellent, but it's Natalie Portman who deserves the most praise. Her character goes through many stages of emotions, and she nailed every one of them with perfection. Her transformation in the second half speaks volumes about her range as an actress. I adored her. Stephen Rea is very good as well as the relentless detective who uncovers how corrupted the government is becoming. It does have some scintillating action scenes, but it's more about character development than anything else. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts: It's a very interesting film, and one that stuck with me. That being said, I don't think I'll ever watch it again. It's got skill to spare, and the acting is fantastic, but it's not something that requires multiple viewings for me. I've had my fill. Do I recommend it? Absolutely! <br/><br/>8/10"

For one thing, it's 2 entire hours long, witch is fine by me, I have 6 hour video streams from my favorite YouTubers saved on my computer. However, I found that whoever I showed this film to got very bored towards the end due to it's length and how long some scenes seem.<br/><br/>My only other nitpick is that it doesn't follow the graphic novel that it's based off of. Although it would take a near 4 hour movie to fit all of that in it, so whether that's a good or bad thing you can decide.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great movie, but it's also not for everyone.

"raynorgo","9","0","2","7 June 2013"," The Gold Standard for Comic Adaptations
","V for Vendetta remains true to its source material while avoiding the pitfalls of a slavishly faithful adaptation. I'll be honest - the movie would be dull and plodding if it included everything in the second book of the graphic novel. Slow and dreary sideplots do little to add to a film's experience and invariably end up causing viewers to glance at their timepieces.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the creators know how to make an entertaining movie while staying true to the spirit of the comic. Hugo Weaving is exemplary as the psychotic yet compassionate terrorist V, and Stephen Fry adds black humour to a depressing film about power-hungry corporatists.<br/><br/>The plot is very similar to the movie, with Evey staying at Deitrich's house instead of that of a generous stranger. V's Shadow Gallery is recreated in extreme detail and faithfulness. Delia's atrocities are reproduced to a starkly realistic effect, and are alone worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>The tale behind the regime's rise to power (not detailed in the comics) is given the royal treatment, providing further enjoyment and deeper enjoyment for fans of the comic. The film's strongest point lies in Evey's incarceration, and although the ending doesn't quite follow the books, it is still powerful and inspiring."

","V for Vendetta is a cult classic, a movie that I never get tired of seeing, I get a regular dosage of V's antiheroes journey to bring freedom back to the people as much as I can; a journey that I always cheer him on wishing that the end was not so tragically inclined. With excellent filming and cinematography (the cinematography was done by the late Adrian Biddle who died before the films initial release), V for Vendetta contained one of the best dialogues I have heard in movies in years, and the scene where he was going to kill the Bishop, where we see V jump on/off the roof in a slow motion video take, was so masterful and it stays in my mind as the best scene in the movie, the second standing out scene is the introduction of V himself when he first met Evey Hammond.<br/><br/>The movie is an adaptation of Alan Moore's V for Vendetta 10 issue comic published by Vertigo, which is based on the life of a man V, who was disfigured by some top government officials who used people who were different, either by race, homophobia behavior or character as guinea pigs to test biological weapons, only one man survived this test, but he was deformed physically and mentally, becoming very smart/intelligent, very strong and fast; this man V went after the government and those who were responsible for his current predicament. The movie has the same foundational plot as the comic, with Hugo Weaving playing V, Natalie Portman playing Evey his protégée and Stephen Rea plays detective Finch.<br/><br/>There are many differences between the movie and the comic; like Evey, in the comic she is an insecure prostitute while here she is a confident young woman. V on the other hand who is portrayed here in this movie as a man with some human emotions and with a romantic link with Evey, in the comic no such romantic link exist and V is very ruthless and violent with no such humanize emotion existing. Also Finch was a die-hard get V man not a man who became soft and believed him.<br/><br/>The screen play to this movie was done by the Wachowski brothers (The Matrix Trilogy). Who then did some comparison with V's life and that of Edmond Dantes in the book/movie The Count of Monte Cristo; Edmond also broke out from prison and plotted his revenge on those behind his imprisonment for years before finally sticking out.<br/><br/>Moore who has been disappointed with two previous film adaptations of two of his other comics, From Hell and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, felt this was also going to be a flop but it was an average financial success and was critically accepted holding a 73% approval on Rotten Tomatoes.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving played V in this Wachowski special he played Agent Smith in their Matrix Trilogy.

Frankly I was a bit Dissatisfied with it, possibly because I loved the book so much I had high expectations.

This being said other parts were up to my expectations. The feel of the oppression, V, Evey, All were great fits. I just wish that they would've planned out the storyline a bit better as to fit in more of the details, I decided to re-read the graphic novel after seeing this just to sort out details I thought I already knew, so for someone who without a little prior knowledge, they could be easily lost in the story line."

","James McTeigue's bold adaption of the Wachowski brothers' screen play is an impressive piece of film-making and script-writing from the latter in what is an ambitious British political thriller. <br/><br/>Hugo Weaving is the mysterious yet intriguing masked extremist V, an extremist who is intent on standing up against the prejudice and unmoral government at the helm of Britain. He forms an unlikely ally in fragile woman Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) who inadvertently is led into the modern Guy Fawkes' so called prepared terrorist attack on the Houses of Parliament. He plans to accomplish this grand feat on the 5th November, bonfire night, Guy Fawkes night!<br/><br/>This is a very ambitious and intellectual thriller which relies heavily on the chemistry of Weaving and Portman during some of the more bloated and long winded political scenes. It also sends out a valid message that is is important we take part in political voting as the country could be being run by a violent tyrant if we do not consider who is best for the vacancy. <br/><br/>Overall, a gripping and emotional tale which stretches out a little too long duration wise and perhaps lets politics stumble in the way of more important features in the film."

","This one is a 7 for me. I did like it, it wasn't bad or even horrible. Its just not very original. This is a veiled, more updated version of Orwell's ""1984"" only now the lead character is a woman, and there is a vigilante added to the fold. The acting is way to over the top, the mask is more than a little comical, and somehow this movie gained a cult following.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" has been around longer than the ""Occupy"" movement ( I seen it when it was first released in 2005). Some how, Anarchists, Marxists, and socialists have latched onto this movie even adopting the mask worn throughout as a symbol. I find this highly entertaining because those groups are actually advocating the style of government that this movie is trying to warn us against. Think of it, Socialism is a system in which you give up your individual freedoms and liberties, in order to benefit the group. The individual ceases to exist and instead the good of the group is more important than you.<br/><br/>Now that we got that out of the way, the movie does have great visual appeal. I don't agree with many other reviews that Natalie Portman was so great in this movie. I think she was just OK, and Overall I would say everyone did a decent job.<br/><br/>I guess what bothered me most was the fact that there was a part near the end ( I'm not going to get into which scene) that was completely stolen from the end of 1984. They didn't even try to hide or disguise it.<br/><br/>Fun little fact: There is a scene in this movie where Natalie Portman is presented to the church official, dressed up, and the church official thinks he is about to have some sort of kinky sex scene. This is a recurring theme and directly tied to Lana Wachowski's personal life. We see the leather clad look of the Matrix movies, Monica Bellucci is seen sporting a very sexy latex outfit in one of them. ""Bound"" is another movie by the brothers and the title says it all. Why? Lana Wachowski was born Larry Wachowski. Larry was heavily into kink, especially crossdressing, In a shocking move Larry wed Karin Winslow, who was at the time one of the most sought after Dominatrices in Los Angeles going by the name of Ilsa Strix. She immediately left the BDSM scene after their marriage, and soon Larry became Lana. Just a fact, I don't judge, and He/She, has pretty good taste because Karin A.K.A Ilsa is a very beautiful woman.<br/><br/>Like my reviews, hate em? Comments, gripes and complaints?

","There are some that will, upon seeing this film, say that it was akin to Andrew Lloyd Weber attempting to make a political statement: overly dramatic. These people would be well served to remember that the symbol of drama is a mask, which certainly begs one important question- Why, if you are so put off by an overtly dramatic motion picture, would you choose to see a movie that stars as the (anti)hero a man in a mask? I just saw this film at an advanced screening and I must say it is nothing short of uniquely brilliant. Entertaining from the start, V manages to combine a strong socio-political message in a compact and highly intense experience. Infused with issues and concepts that pervade in the global political climate of our times, this movie is endowed with a tremendous timely relevance that belies its trappings as a mere action adventure.<br/><br/>The acting, the cinematography, the effects, and the general vision of this film all lead me to believe that it will likely receive a cult following. It is only my hope that the message of this film will come to summarize the history of our future ascendancy to true liberty.<br/><br/>Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.

Sure the dialogue comes out like it's written and doesn't seem natural, but than again this takes place in the future. So the plot is this, there is this character V that fights for justice and freedom even if he has to get his hands dirty. And is labeled as a terrorist while he tries rise up against a totalitarian government. Than he meets Evey played by Natalie Portman that is a witness of V's doings. And V has big plans that leads up to the 5th of November. Agent Smith I mean Hugo Weaving was perfect for this role as V, he played it in a very charming and charismatic manner that is believable. This movie simply had style, substance and intelligence thanks to the excellent writing by Alan Moore. Sure the movie has some parts where it isn't fully explained and doesn't make sense sometimes but those are very few and the direction it goes makes it forgivable.

","This is the 2005 film adaptation of the comic series published between 1982-1989 that achieved a new notoriety in 2011 when members of the anti-capitalist Occupy movement adopted the stylised Guy Fawkes mask worn by the eponymous libertarian cum terrorist. Although set in London, it was largely shot on sets in the Babelsberg studios outside Berlin (which I have visited) with a crucial final sequence filmed at the long unused Aldwych tube station in London (whose closed entrance I've walked past many times). Also, although many of the support parts are filled by familiar British actors, the two leading roles are taken by non-British thespians who nevertheless affect convincing English accents: English-Australian Hugo Weaving who is V and Israeli- American Natalie Portman as Evey who becomes his companion in arms.<br/><br/>These leading actors have very different experiences on set: we never see Weaving's face and he wears a long wig as well as mask and cloak, whereas Portman is in one sequence stripped down to a hospital-like gown and her face is the subject of unusual focus when she has to lose all of her hair. Characters in this movie - most notably V himself - are more complicated and nuanced than in most such fantasy tales and I was more impressed by the work and it provoked more thought than I was expecting.<br/><br/>Although V has some pretty special physical characteristics and skills, this is no super- hero movie but an altogether more grounded and usually much darker exposition of an avenger with contemporary themes around the need to fight for individual and collective liberty. As a Londoner who has worked in the Houses of Parliament, I had mixed feelings about a plot to blow up the building some four centuries after Fawkes failed and, as a peace-loving democrat, I was troubled by V's propensity to dispense summary justice with some relish, but his character had suffered cruelly and he was on a vendetta."

","I came across this film by pure accident: a list on a blog somewhere of good 'revolutionary' films. I rented it, watched it... then bought it. It's that good.<br/><br/>Admittedly there are many things I find a little rough, like V's overt theatricality (yes, it's part of the character; yes, it's a bit too heavy), the very typical characterisation of the religious leader (who's actually a pervert behind closed doors), the brutal dictatorship based on religion and so on. However, they're just standard tools to tell a story and this one's VERY well told.<br/><br/>The casting is excellent. Portman's brilliant as usual, Weaving proves you don't need to have your face all over the screen to have presence, Rea does a wonderful job of being the cop torn between justice and feelings (and narrating certain parts so they're clear, without seeming like he's narrating) and even Fry (who I'm not a fan of, really) is cast in just the right role. John Hurt? No need to wonder, he's always great.<br/><br/>All in all, there are some heavy-handed moments and the script's a bit OTT but then that's to be expected from a graphic novel conversion and it works with the theatrical feel of the film. <br/><br/>Very, very enjoyable.

","In the fight alone against the British Government, V is a hero played by Hugo Weaving, which could be considered a crazy man. Evey is played by Natalie Portman, she is the only person V has ever loved. Evey is in a struggle to figure out if V is a hero or a villain. V is driven to take revenge on anyone who was involved in him being disfigured from the fire. In the process of revenge V rescues Evey from the police, while she's caught walking after curfew. Evey is intrigued at the orchestra show V puts on for her, while destroying government buildings. Realizing V is trying to fight for freedom, Evey is not sure if he is the villain or the hero. V could be considered a terrorist that is, destine to blow up England's Parliament. Transmitting a message across the Televisions emergency station V states, in exactly 1 year whoever wants to break down the Government and fight for freedom should meet him on the lawn. The television station that V sends the message from is the same station that Evey works for. The station is of course owned by the very controlling Government. V wears a mask, that reminds me much of the Batman Movies. Batman is a hero, but also could be considered a villain. Another film that V reminds me of would be the Phantom of the Opera. The Phantom of the Opera wears a mask to hide his disfigurements as well. The mask kept my attention throughout the movie I was hoping to see the face underneath. Thousands of masks were sent out to citizens to wear on the night the Parliament would be destroyed. The movie is dark and sinister, with the music matching it perfectly. At V's lair it is dark and full of statues and items that V has stolen. With V's mask there is a significant amount of shadowing done. With too bright of lighting the effects of the mask would not work the same, it would not take the audience to the place they should be. The surreal feeling of what happens in the film V for Vendetta could happen in any country. I felt the film was extremely entertaining from the sword fighting to the orchestra being played through the speakers on the street. Revenge and bombing of buildings, there was nothing slow about the movie. V for Vendetta is a must see film."

","I'm not so sure if this review would be a SPOILER, so just be careful when you read mine. This movie is very, very, very, very, very AWESOME. A masked man named V has nothing but revenge on his mind from being tortured and tested on, until he meets Eve. The things he says, the things he does, everything has a purpose. He makes you think with what he says. V is planning to destroy Parliament in order to send a message. He wants all of the citizens to end the dictatorship and fight for freedom, and most importantly, free will. This movie is directed towards everyone. The message is clear that V doesn't believe that freedom is enough without the power of free will. The citizens are afraid to stand up for what they believe in when they don't realize that they have the power to rule themselves. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was that it ended. I'd recommend it to anyone!"
"jbehbin","9","0","2","8 March 2011"," Great movie but NOT as good as the comic.
","Its a good movie. Action and all was good. Idk y some guy said Natalie Portman sucks as an actress. she's one of my favorites to be honest and does a brilliant job in this movie. I really REALLY hate the fact that they took out ANY mention of Anarchism. The whole premise and conflict from the graphic novel was V being an anarchist fighting a fascist government. As Alan Moore said this movie was turned more into a liberalism vs neo conservatism. I know the Wachowski brothers want to make it more relevant but then that's not a true adaptation or true to the character V. V in the book mentions why he hates authority/ governments and how his true justice and democracy is anarchism. It explains more of how his hate came to fruition and a little more of how V's mind works. They didn't mention hardly any of this in the film. As someone said in a review one minute he's a madman terrorist the next part in the movie he's a loved rebel by the people. As Moore said also some of the characters especially the bad guys are more rounded in the book but I cant blame the Wachowski brothers for that. They do have time constraints and deadlines to meet. I believe they still did a good job adapting the movie (unlike how fox ruined deadpool in wolverine origins). I like how they explained the back-story of the gown powder plot and guy fawkes day. I did like the ending of the movie better then the graphic novel also. I recommend you to see this film but if your also into reading comics and graphic novels I suggest you also find a cheap paper back (or hardcover) Of the original v for vendetta graphic novel. Its around 20 but you can probably find slightly used V comics for about 10 bucks. Overall awesome film. I would give it normally a 10! Or even a added 11 because it was and still is one of my favorite movies of all time. Re watching though I realized they left some crucial things to me out from the graphic novel so I give it a 9.V is one of my favorite comic characters besides deadpool and he still helps me to embrace the burning rebellion I have in me every now and them. Remember people freedom forever! A... V. Have fun watching the movie and enjoy! =]"
"gethelred","9","0","2","8 March 2011"," For a rendition of a graphic novel, this is very good
","To be honest, i loved this film.<br/><br/>I saw the film before I read the graphic novel, and thus, my impression of it is tainted by the fact that I judge the novel in comparison to the movie; thus, the novel clearly stands out. However, given that it is a movie adaption, reviewers of this movie that read the novel first should perhaps allow the directors and the producers some license and some freedom to do what they wish with the plot; that is what was done with Transformers, as well as Watchmen, and Watchmen was an extremely faithful adaption of the graphic novel; pity, then, that the acting within it was so woeful.<br/><br/>Back to the movie at hand; Hugo Weaving is, despite all of the other reviews lambasting him as awful, immaculate as our hero that is both Zorro and Thomas Jefferson. The loquacious V character was a difficult proposition to cast, and to act; the Halo movie was canceled because the writers and the movie companies found it difficult to believe a man in a mask could emote, or even show evidence of humanity. This is part of where i think the other reviewers went wrong; Hugo Weaving's role was extremely difficult; that he manages to carry it off at all is a testament to his talent.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is equitable as Evey Hammond; i will agree with the criticism that she was far too old for her part, but that was a choice of the casting, and is hardly her fault. Her accent isn't too awful- granted, that I'm not British- and her acting throughout is commendable, if not amazing; the scene in which she kisses V through his mask is difficult to watch for all the right reasons.<br/><br/>The back up cast of Adam Sutler, Creedy, Inspector Finch and others all work well enough. Whomever thinks that John Hurt, who played Adam Sutler, was not very good in his role is being foolish; his character was subtracted from when they decided to edit his relationship with the supercomputer from the movie. This omission was not entirely the wisest of ideas; this lead to plot inconsistency, as V could not possibly have done all the things he did in the film and still have enough time to torture Evey. The computer explained everything; that omission made the story less credulous.<br/><br/>V in the novel is, as has been said by others, an utter anarchist, as are some of the other characters that were dropped for the movie adaption. However, this anarchist framework would not have worked out in the movie; the writers wanted to provide hope for the future, and this was done via a number of well converted speeches from the text.<br/><br/>The video broadcast, from when V takes over the London Tower, had more to do with our current political situation than the novel, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. This film wasn't aimed at Thatcheresque London, or Orwellesque Spain or Russia; this film was aimed in dual at America and Britain, George Bush and Tony Blair respectively, and as such the political critiques contained within are modified appropriately.<br/><br/>This movie can be used as a form or treatise on neoconservatism, and its aims. However, this need not be the way it is observed; it can also be viewed as a political thriller and a comic book film, although in that latter case it is so far ahead of the Xmen adaptations that they look antiquated and made for children.<br/><br/>Another critique offered is that the rating was not truly warranted; national boards of ratings are very rarely liberal. That this film contained mature ideas is not in dispute; there is the opening scene in which V saves Evey from being raped, not to mention the images of Evey's family being dragged away, Deidric's capture at the hands of Creedy, and the flashback, when Evey is in 'prison'. This movie deals with terrorism, and fascism, in high amounts, with a little anarchism thrown in for good measure; (yes, i know there isn't as much in the movie as the book) try to deal with what is in front of you without knowing what was there first.<br/><br/>Finally, i would like to finish with some criticisms. Another reviewer noted that Deidric as a homosexual with a Koran is a bit of a misnomer- the Koran is fairly strong in it's stance on homosexuality. The style of governance that finally results is not clear, but this is both a good thing as a bad. Natalie Portman is too suspicious and not nearly innocent enough for the role, and V is less an idea as a man gripped by ideas.<br/><br/>But ultimately this film is an emotional one; the note Evey receives in prison is beautiful and powerful. That writing was taken clear from the text, and it fills the reader with such sorrow and pride that one cannot help but be moved. The final scene, in which Evey blows up parliament, is wonderful; the symbolism of everyone removing their masks, and revealing every person filmed- including the dead ones- is so utterly breathtaking in it's articulation that, no matter what, the people will outlive a regime, and that might will always fail if the collective wills.<br/><br/>Yes, the book was better than the movie. But others need to judge what else there is in the range of political thrillers before they start to whine about the quality of this one, compared to the book upon which it was based."
"Gyrannon","9","0","7","14 January 2011"," Grand story, deviant planning, provokes words into action
","When I first heard of V for Vendetta, I was thinking it was going to be something similar to the Comic movies (Spiderman, Xmen, Superman, etc), but obviously my assumption was way off. The beginning was dark, it showed London as a completely destroyed country with all that remains is constant Martial Law, a society of order, but also has much corruption. An in the face of such corruption comes London's hero, V. V was unexpected, well thought out, deviant but justly, carries a heavy burden that apparently only he can stop & reshape, and holds similar personalities to Edmund Dantes, Phantom of Opera, Batman (a very small part), and Neo - a man that is more than a man, but a symbol, a symbol to both inspire the masses and make the corrupt fear the future. While the movie (and story) was better than I had originally imagined, I was sad that V was never shown, and ultimately, and literally, died for both his beliefs an his revenge against the corrupt government. The movie STILL to this day, fills me up with the thought of hope an that one day, the world will see a similar symbol that will free us all from what we fear. The message I believe that was meant, was not unity through terrorism or anarchy, but through inspiration, an to quote inspiration through V, ""While the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth."" A movie that feels a bit short, has a grand story, famous actors, and a spectacular plot with a grand end. A truly MUST see."

","Watched this again today after not seeing it for a few years. And I have to say I appreciated it a lot more than previous times. I love the dystopic society that was created and how that could be reality for the future.<br/><br/>People saying that we don't see Hugo Weavings' face at all, are wrong as it adds to the whole mystery and make up of the character. It also emphasise the whole 'remember the idea and not the man' line as we mearly see V as a figure or forefront of an idea, rather than a leader in human form.<br/><br/>Overall it is a definite must see.

"rippin-rifs","10","0","5","5 January 2011"," Awesome plot line! (see what I did there?)
","I love the connotations between Moore's and Orwell's work, particularly in V for Vendetta. Unfortunately film adaptations of Moore's graphic novels tend to get the comic-adaptation tag which rather detracts from any messages in the stories. This is less so with V than it is for Watchmen which really got held up with action sequences and personal stories. Casting did a great job in getting John Hurt which for some would raise an immediate association with 1984; an undeniably similar reality into which V is set. Tchaikovsky really does make the film though. A small reference to political greed and tyranny (Overture was written just before Napoleon's Russian campaign failed, halting his empire and also saving Britain). In any case the Overture finale had to be the song. It causes a swelling of pride, but not national pride, rather a hope that we might find unity and strength when confronted by tyranny. Use of the mask as imagery had notable impact, even leading to the formation the 'Anonamous terrorist group' (as put by the BBC) who follow in the true spirit of V. More of this sort of thing!"

Some people may say that this movie incites people to do terrorism, or to dissolve governments whenever they please to. But the real thing is that the movie want to remind us that the power of a country reside on their people. They are the ones who choose their legislators, in fact, the complete government perce. V wants to teach us a lesson, which is that the ideas never dies; and no matter what horrible things you had to live to maintaining, it never dies. Thats the problems with governments that once they have the power in their hands, they want us to forgot who chosen them, just to do things their way, so they can may other people richer, thanks! for the government enterprise. The government or State doesn't exist so they can use it as business, under contrary, the government exist because their job is to protect the people of their nation and their private interest, to protect their liberty and maintain the peace and unity (Locke)and not to create conflicts that doesn't exist, so they can control the people by using the fear as a tool. That is not ethical at all, is cruel, because is a way of using the people debilities to manipulate them as they were puppets.<br/><br/>To the people that have doubts of if they should see or not the movie, I totally recommended.The movie doesn't incited to blow a building or something like that, but instead, touch a lot of themes that could make you think a lot and at the same time is totally enjoyable, because of the ironic humor that the character of V (by Hugo Weaving)had. If you thing that Hugo Weaving couldn't pull this off, you are wrong, because he manage to give life a character that had not expression but a mask. V really can make you be interest in what he's saying, doing, etc... The movie over pass my expectations, and I promise you that it would do the same thing on you."

","As I pen this in the balmy days of spring, the tax days of mid-April are still in the rear view mirror, but I am looking forward to baking my body in Florida's relentless summer sunshine.<br/><br/>It is ""betwixt and between"" time for movies. It is too soon for the teenage, guilty-pleasure blockbuster of summer and the Academy nominees are drifting to the DVD and rental shelves. Nonetheless, for me, the movie theater still beckons.<br/><br/>I knew nothing about the V for Vendetta comic book series before seeing the movie. I was quite surprised by it. This is a futuristic British world, festooned with government cameras, where the media panders to neo-Nazi dressing fascist government of thugs.<br/><br/>The hero is a dark, Shakespearean quoting knight, wielding a chest full of Japanese fighting swords and a weirdly disturbing, grinning white mask. He saves the girl and introduces himself with a tongue-twisting soliloquy. The hero, V for Vendetta, challenges the government by threatening to blow-up a government building in the British tradition of Guy Fawkes. He is always one-step ahead of the bad guys, wreaking his murderous revenge for their cruelty and corruption.<br/><br/>The movie makes a unwittingly, depiction of the madness and inspiration of terrorists. Blow up the building, V thinks, and the public will see that a government trampling their individual rights is more of a threat than their irrational fears (yeah, right).<br/><br/>Although I pump my movies through my almost fantastic classic Klipsch Khorn loudspeakers system, I still appreciate movie theaters with speakers lining the walls and stadium seating. These venues are particularly good for action films, my favorite genre being the sci-fi action movie. In this case, it was a delight to wander into the big box and see a late spring entry. If you like the same genre, I think you will like V for Vendetta.<br/><br/>The domino scene (where V tips over black and red dominoes to form a giant letter V) involved 22,000 dominoes, was assembled by four professional domino assemblers, and took 200 hours to set up.<br/><br/>In the scene where V has Creedy cornered in the greenhouse, V plays Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. In Morse Code, the opening notes of this piece are ""... _"", or V. This is also the reason for the piece's enormous popularity in England during World War Two. (The Allied slogan was ""V for Victory"".) The Symphony's opening was used as a call-sign in the European broadcasts of the BBC during World War II in reference to Winston Churchill's ""V for Victory"".<br/><br/>The name Evey is pronounced EV, with E being the fifth letter of the alphabet, V being five in Latin and Y being the 25th letter (5 squared) On a clock that has an hour hand and a minute hand, the time 11:05 makes a V. These two numbers, 11 and 5, where 11 is November, and 5 is the day of November, spell out: the fifth of November. ""Remember, remember the 5th of November."" The voice-overs about the futility of non-violence and the definition of humanism that can be heard during the end credits are sound bites from speeches given by Malcolm X and Gloria Steinem, respectively.<br/><br/>In the memorial for those that died as a result of the virus, the statues are of children playing ""Ring around the Rosie"". There is a frequently cited (though untrue) urban legend that this nursery rhyme was about the bubonic plague.<br/><br/>SPOILER: When Evey is being captured by a member of the commando outside Dietrich's house, if we look closer, we can see that the commando member has burnt flesh (it is visible trough the commando mask's hole for the eyes), so it is obvious that he is V. But it is visible only for a second."

","After escaping an assault late after curfew, Evie (Portman) befriends a masked vigilante known only as V (Weaving) who plans to blow up Parliament on the 5th of November.<br/><br/>Based on Alan Moore's best selling graphic novel, this explicit sci-fi drama looks at the foundations of the British Government with a kick and a punch to justify the political incorrectness of current world society.<br/><br/>The film opens with Evie looking to visit her friend but is caught unawares by a group of Fingermen. The initial delight at Natalie Portman's perfected English accent and narration will soon subside as we dive into a world of rules and regulations with an ultimate bad controller, the lead Chancellor of the Fingermen, John Hurt's charismatic Adam Sutler.<br/><br/>The basis of this watchful big brother style control over England is explained in due course but we see subtle hints and continuous shocks of the power of this dominant group. The curfew, the use of easy killing and the weapons at disposal are all issues debated over in the ongoing democracy that is our government, all points worth mentioning as this film seeks to do justice to the legend of Guy Fawkes.<br/><br/>The adapted script by the Wachowski brothers is keen to back every point up. The foundations around the legendary acts by Guy Fawkes, the power of justice and gaining a well run community seems the best intentions. From numerous reviews I have read, it seems a couple of historical points are off but because this script is so intriguing and powerful, the odd date and unification won't throw you off too much.<br/><br/>The script is powerful. It is quite talky but the power behind speech is very effective in conveying the message of justice. The justice ideology is heavily weighed with a significant pile of right and wrong murders as a shock to the system. Not so much controversial inclusion but a significant stepping stone in the film's themes.<br/><br/>Amongst all the hefty debates and political ideologies there are numerous well executed montages of action. For one, the vastly impressive domino sequence is so sublime that you question the commitment that went into it. The explosive nature of the films true point is well shot with some powerful symbolism.<br/><br/>The use of symbols and messages is an interesting inclusion. From flowers to the simple lettering of V, James McTeigue's picture gives a familiar and stable balance and added intrigue into the man behind the mask.<br/><br/>Weaving's talking masked man is effective to generate mystery and an ounce of sorrow when we hear of his desire to dance. His fighting style is excellent. Portman's Evie is a quiet protagonist, taking a backseat to V but the pair generate a good on screen pairing.<br/><br/>V For Vendetta is an exquisite message meaning montage of action and drama that will entertain many."

","I was hesitant about seeing this film at the time of its release - the reviews, after all, were very mixed. But I did pick it up on cheap DVD recently, and glad I am that I did.<br/><br/>The film is set in Britain of the future, a fascist dictatorship under the control of ""High Chancellor Sutler"" (John Hurt) who seized his chance when the US collapsed into civil war to play on people's fears and establish himself in more or less absolute power.<br/><br/>The ""V"" of the title refers to a figure wearing a Guy Fawkes mask who turns up at an opportune moment, to rescue the heroine, Evey, who is about to be assaulted by three of the thuggish Fingermen, a kind of auxiliary police force about as unlike the traditional British bobby as it is possible to imagine.<br/><br/>The film has many pleasures. Splendid performances from pretty well everybody - particular praise should go to Hugo Weaving, who never shows his face and must act using only speech and body language - a witty script and good use of music all combine well. Its topicality, in these days of the ""War on Terror"", is also to its advantage.<br/><br/>It is never boring, but often moving. The only thing that spoils it for me is the rather silly fireworks display that blew up the Houses of Parliament. Some might find the result gratifying, but the overall effect was childish.<br/><br/>A film well worth seeing nonetheless. Rating: 7/10"

I understand the point, really, but this plot is only encouraging people to rebel against their government when we should be focusing on unity, and anti-terrorism and not homicidal maniacs! Did anyone notice that Hugo Weaver's dialect and voice pitch changes when he's got Evey in his so-called lair? His body shape was different too. Perhaps the director was purposely having him disguise his voice so that she would not recognize him, but it was just way too different. Even though his form was a mere shadow image, you can tell another stand-in was playing Hugo's part. I bought this film in hopes that one day it can be shown to children of tomorrow when we've somewhat controlled terrorism in our democracies, yet we are having political problems within our own countries. We people still have the power if we want. The whole thing was too dramatic, and what is the point of blowing up the buildings when it's the leaders who are messing us up as a society?

","This movie was difficult to watch the second time. I had read the book and loved it. I envisioned what a movie would be like, with a few tiny liberties. I saw this movie shortly after it was released and tried to hold my criticism from my friends when we walked out. They were blown away and wondering how I didn't feel the same. There are often times when a motion picture adaption of a novel, comic book, or even true events can only be responded with a shrug or slight nod. The comic book series was written as one complete story back in the early eighties by Alan Moore and was a staple in DC Comics' history. <br/><br/>When the movie was being released, I wasn't sure if I wanted to see it because of the liberties I was sure they had taken. But, the trailers and reviews had me wanting to see it. My friends, who had never read the book, were excited while I was a little apprehensive. I knew the story could translate into a good movie if done right but didn't want to ruin the vision that the book had given. I decided to partake in some recreational prescriptions before I entered the theater to become a little limber in the viewing.<br/><br/>I'll start with the negative.<br/><br/>I was upset with one of Finch's scenes that totally erases how he found out what happened at the concentration camp. In the book, it is a very serious and emotional part of his role in the story bringing him closer to understanding V. I was fine with the liberties that were taken of the time and place of the events, as the movie was made several years after the story takes place and they obviously wanted it to be modern day. I do like Natalie Portman as an actress but felt they should have just found a good English actress instead of tacking on big names for a title not many people knew about. Being very fond of the book, I have to say that this is a very rushed and weak adaption of Alan Moore's epic story. I appreciated the Wachowski brothers for The Matrix, the sequels left me with blue balls, and I was just about to credit them for having good taste in comics before they made this but have to despise them for cashing in on one of my favorite books<br/><br/>Although, if you've never read the book, you might love this movie. I found myself wishing I had never read the book because as a movie, it is well made, entertaining and thought-provoking. <br/><br/>Hang in there, Alan."

Throughout the movie it never varies in its (non-)expression and eloquence - like an endless lecturing monologue by Elrond. It never suggests a human being with emotional ups and downs behind the mask, except for one scene where V cries. A beautiful voice and admirable performance in the ""Matrix"", but a set-back for this movie - not the voice, but the style. I'm a great fan of his, but he should have tried to convey more than hate and determination and show a few defining ""cracks"" in the V character.

"Galagonya","7","0","3","22 June 2007"," V for Vendetta is good, while it should have been great.
","V for Vendetta - despite the obviously good basic story, for which and for the great performances I give 7 points- is somehow not well done. I do not wonder Alan Moore, the creator of V refused any association with this adaptation.<br/><br/>Thus in the following I shall try to only criticize the movie as it was made, and leave the comic as such alone.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving is a fine actor and it is a very unrewarding task to accept a role of a man in a mask because it could- technically - be just anybody else. The same was true for Edward Norton when he did the part of King Baldwin in Kingdom of Heaven. It is rare that a man in a mask can be remembered for additional features such as singing as Gerard Butler in the Phantom of the Opera. So all together, very brave of Hugo Weaving, and I am sorry we did not get to see any of him.<br/><br/>The genre is unclear and undefined. It is not a drama as Children of Men, as V chooses death over a life with Evey, who loves her. It is not a profound criticism of our civilization as such- well, maybe it is for the English, anyway-, as 1984. It is not an action-flick in the sense of Matrix - the parts meant to be action are rare and understated. The story (interpreted by the Wachowsky Brothers) is not as fascinating as that of the Island, for example. It tries to get the best of all these and ends up using the worst clichés of all. <br/><br/>At some points, the story-telling obviously stumbles.<br/><br/>There is the end scene, where all dead (who made their very own sacrifice and should be honored and left alone) are standing within the amazed crowd again. I really tried to see this as some sort of statement relating to the disturbing and stupid monologue Evey has to deliver at the end on the topic ""V was all of us"". My attempt failed and it still looked stupid.<br/><br/>And why does no one (the parents of Evey, Deitrich, the girl whose story Evey reads while she is in prison) ever try to flee in this movie? Evereybody is sitting and having a cup of tea, waiting for the guys with the black bags to arrive.<br/><br/>Why is V so kind with the lady he kills, who is obviously one of the key figures that lead to his deformation and torture? Obviously we are supposed to understand that he is a gentleman. <br/><br/>Why does V tell the police officer that he has been waiting for him all these years??? What does that police officer do, anyway? And the ultimate goof where I really had to laugh out loud- the slowing-down and Matrix-like falling of the raindrops when Evey is freed from prison, as well as the slow motion burning of the fire from where V had to escape, put together- we would have seen the parallel anyway, thank you, those 10 minutes or so would not have been necessary. Ant the fact that Evey even uttered ""God is in the rain"" - a touching sentence which has been read by her just 10 sec. ago so everybody still remembered it- is an insult and seriously damages this climax of the plot.<br/><br/>Further, I have to mention that I can not imagine where on earth Evey found those roses in the underground to put on the deathbed of V. Maybe I just missed something.<br/><br/>Higlights are the Benny Hill-tribute of Stephen Fry's character, V's monologues and fencing, and Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta as a movie is good, but it is the subject matter that is great.

","Having never even picked up the graphic novel this film is based on, let alone read anything by Alan Moore, I was a complete novice when viewing this film. I think that this helps - I know that if I had been a true fan of the book I would have been on here straight away complaining about what the Wachowski brothers had done to it.<br/><br/>As it was, I really enjoyed this film. We are introduced to Natalie Portman's character almost straight away. Her performance is a little dodgy to begin with but towards the middle of the film it really strengthened and I really warmed to her. I think it's because that's when we start to learn more about her past, and then we have the rather long scenes of torture (with a wonderful twist at the end, by the way) in which Portman really needs to show such a mixed bag of emotions. It redeems her for the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy at any rate.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving is V, the title character - and there you have to take their word for it. You never, ever see V's face - just a Guy Fawkes Mask on a figure clothed entirely in black, reminding some of us of No Face from ""Spirited Away"". It is difficult to sympathise with V - he truly cares for Evey, and his plans to rid England of John Hurt's Sutler and his Fascist government mean well, but he is at the other end of the spectrum a terrorist and a bit of a madman come to that. This is partly explained with the origins story that every ""superhero"" film needs, but I still felt uneasy about the character, despite the brilliant performance of Hugo Weaving.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are fantastic, though apart from Stephen Rea's character we could see a bit more of them. Stephen Fry is rather good in a rare dramatic role which ends violently, but John Hurt's villain is more of a cameo performance than anything else, despite been rather ironic considering his past roles (Winston in ""1984"" has now literally become Big Brother).<br/><br/>Overall the film is really good, though there are a couple of unanswered questions, and the political overtones do rather overshadow the film in this post 9-11 world.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I put off watching this because I was tired of the masked hero comic genre and wasn't sure if this was another action flick with lots of CGI and a thin plot. But do I regret it! Sure, the weaknesses I feared were there - too much of The Phantom of the Opera, a number of Big Brother clichés and Natalie Portman was so kosher it hurts - but this film is saved by virtue of its timing. The film also considerably at some junctures even though the action was well- choreographed and worthy of the makers of The Matrix. It is long, the narrative familiar but engrossing enough. Before 2000, I would have scoffed at the probability of such a plot premise which would have seemed far-fetched and over the top. Watching it in this day and age, I get chills and goosebumps not because the film was that good but because the times we're in are that bad. Before 2000, the self-evident truths in the film would have made it trite, today, they are strangely poignant. All the references to atrocities tolerated are so ordinary to us at this moment in time, it is almost psychotically hilarious. It is so unsettling to sit through this that towards the end, one actually finds great relief that the directors did not deny us a hopeful trajectory and one is happy to embrace the ""Hollywood"" ending because the possibility of us fighting back instead of sinking into greater paranoia and apathy against neo-fascism in our lifetime is to put it optimistically, bleak. How many truly care about the erosion of civil liberties, detention without trial or torture camps? Well, if you've got nothing to hide, what are you afraid of? Nuke Iran and potentially killing millions? Shrug. In that, this is highly recommended as a great escapist film."

He announces on national TV that he plans to blow up parliament on November 5. Stephen Rea plays a police detective trying to catch him.<br/><br/>Weaving is excellent and charismatic as V.

"howard.schumann","9","0","1","11 December 2006"," Reinvigorates our hopes for humanity
","V for Vendetta is a Hollywood action film with a difference  it is a film of ideas that has something intelligent to say about contemporary society. Directed by James McTeigue, assistant director of The Matrix trilogy and written by the Wachowski Brothers, the film is based on a graphic novel from the 1980s by Alan Moore (who did not want his name in the credits) directed against then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Though it has its roots in a comic strip, it asks a serious question  whether political action must be accomplished by peaceful means through established political channels or whether civil disobedience (aka terrorism) is justified when everything else has failed.<br/><br/>The film is set in the year 2020. The United States has ostensibly sunk into chaos caused by a civil war and the UK is run by a right-wing Christian-oriented, totalitarian elite that has stifled dissent and robbed the population of their democratic rights. Political opponents have been imprisoned or executed, police rule the streets after dark, and Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) is a pervasive presence on the government-controlled television screens. Beneath their protective facade, the government plants stories in the media and lies to the people about disasters which they themselves fostered to further limit political liberty and solidify control. What they do not count on, however, is a masked vigilante with a personal ax to grind.<br/><br/>Known only as V (Hugo Weaving), this mysterious renegade seeks revenge for his disfigurement that resulted from a fire during medical experiments when he was held in a detention center. The film allows us to see quite clearly that revolutionaries do not come from thin air but are created when their human dignity is violated. Performed with flair and poetry by Hugo Weaving, V's goal is not only to get back at those involved in the experiments but, with the help of an aroused populace, to bring down the entire government.<br/><br/>V is a superhero who fights for right and justice, yet, unlike superheroes of the past who had their enemies arrested, he is a killer without moral compunction. It is easy to judge his behavior, yet faced with the circumstances of fascist oppression, we do not know how we would react. We hear his disembodied voice but never see his face, only the mask he wears, with its smirking grin forever painted on his face. It is the mask of Guy Fawkes, a Catholic zealot who was arrested and hanged for his part in a plot to blow up the parliament buildings on November 5, 1605. V seeks to fulfill Fawkes' goal four hundred years later.<br/><br/>V is a loner but recruits support in the person of Evey Hammond, an orphan who comes to believe in his cause after he rescues her from an assault by roaming police squads. After V saves her life, he transports her to a rooftop to witness the destruction of Old Bailey, London's central criminal court building, in an audacious scene complete with fireworks display and Tchaikovsky's ""1812 Overture."" Natalie Portman turns in a powerful performance as Evey who does not become fully committed until she is forced to undergo a physical and emotional ordeal where her values are fully tested. Also strong is Stephen Rea as Finch, a Police Inspector who begins to question where his government is taking him.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta brings up reminders of Abu Ghraib with its hooded prisoners and of Nazi concentration camps and Guantanamo with torture scenes and persecution of gays but it is not mired in relentless despair. The relationship between Evey and V becomes an unconventional romance and V's swashbuckling swordplay mimicking the film, The Count of Monte Cristo, lightens the mood considerably. V for Vendetta is not high art nor is its political message always coherent, but it is a stylish thriller that is emotionally riveting whether or not you support its basic ideas. It is also a work of conviction that succeeds in challenging our minds and, in its stirring conclusion, reinvigorating our hope for humanity."

Remember all the suffering people have suffered throughout history from one another. Remember the power hungry egomaniacs. Remember what is happening today. Yes, remember neo-conservatism because what people will think of it in the future depends on what you think of it today. V for Vendetta is current in its theme, but it also urges us, anyone, to see injustice in its every form: it does not force a certain perspective or opinion other than what should be the human norm.

I feel that ""V for Vendetta"" is asking some very interesting questions about things like terror, oppression and media influence. But don't expect easy solutions, there just aren't any.

","Every once in a while I live on the edge! I purchase a film on DVD without seeing it first or reading a review. My purchase of V for Vendetta is one such occasion. What a purchase it proved to be, not because it was thrill a minute stuff, not because it had a totally unexpected twist, but because it made me think. Unfortunately part of what this film portrayed is very true today that is to say we are manipulated by politicians and the media. The untrained eye may miss it but it is happening all the same. I shall get off my soapbox and back to the film. V for Vendetta represents the first time I had seen Natalie Portman outside of Star Wars and I was very impressed and Hugo Weaving has one of those voices I could listen to all day long and that makes what his character says all the more potent. The plot was totally believable and the action realistic. This is not a crash bang wallop film. It is action, a love story and a vision of the future that might actually come to pass. When I find myself sitting down with two hours to kill V for vendetta will certainly be one of the DVD's I reach for first! A very good film!"

","This is a movie you'll not want to miss. My tip is think when you watch it. Don't just watch actors saying something and the effects. Think about it. This is one of the best movies i've watched recently and even at all. Although it is based on a comic it is very modern. I mean it is up to date and much too real. Think about all the similarities between some characters and events in the movie and in real life. Think about the ""idea"". This isn't just a sci-fi, action, fantasy flick. This is something else. It has a ""something"" that is missing from most movies. It has a Plot. The good thing is that the crew slightly changed the screenplay so it is more real than the comic. They've done a great job. The acting is great. The sound and effects are great. The crew have made an excellent job. I think this movie deserves to be in the top 100 and maybe even top 50 movies of all time. DO watch it. You will not be sorry for spending on this movie."

","One of the Best movies I have ever seen. The Wachowski brothers have made their best effort since Matrix I. Argument 10/10, Acting 10/10, Visual 10/10. At the beginning Evey (Nathalie Portman), is remembering the acts of November 5th, when Guy Fawkes tried to explode the corrupt parliament of that time, he was arrested and condemned, but his ideals survived in ""V"" (the masked protagonist). ""V"" uses terrorist tactics to make corrupt government have fear of a future revolution, and open the closed eyes of the people. Many of us have fear or feel comfortable with our governments, many of us think that the governments are there representing our interests. Corruption and pseudo-totalitarianism's masked as democracies are the symbols of many governments of our present, you'll never know when things will go too far, zero rights respected.<br/><br/>Go and see this movie, It will make you appreciate more your liberty, and Remember, remember is your right to claim for your rights."
"Quik87","7","0","1","5 November 2006"," Good Movie-- hampered by political propaganda
","What astounds me about people who ""define"" totalitarian governments is that there is always a connotation that totalitarian governments are usually conservative because they support a strong national defense. This is always false, as totalitarian governments usually arise out of socialist/liberal governments. Think the Soviet Union, Nazism, African dictatorships, all of those governments arise out of workers complaints. In fact the only conservative government I can think of at all that was totalitarian was apartheid South Africa. The goal of conservatism is to eliminate government from life as much as possible, hardly a tenet of totalitarianism. The one job that conservatives do believe the federal government does have is to protect people with a strong national defense. Also, the assumption that Christians want to outlaw homosexuality and other religions and rule the government is absolutely ridiculous, and why is it that Christianity gets bashed but Islam gets a free ride? Remember, it isn't Christians who are forcing women to wear barquas and performing female circumcision on them. It isn't Christians who are murdering people who refuse to convert to their religion. I understand that there are Christians who have no grace and mercy, and who do nothing put point their fingers from their pulpits into cameras and broadcast that image across the world as the face of Christianity, but that's not a real picture of a Christian. Vandetta portrays Christianity as doing this to people, and that's not true at all. It's sympathetic view of homosexuality and the gay movement is a pure sob story for the gay left. If people choose to live that lifestyle, that's their business, but it's hard to think that this is an accurate view of homosexuality, especially when results regarding questions of the monogamy in their relationships are concerned. <br/><br/>Indeed, V for Vandetta is an excellent adaptation of Alan Moore's graphic novel based upon the fears of the Maggie Thatcher government. It has a unique balance of action, excitement and even some romance. Hugo Weaving and Natalie Portman give excellent performances and we feel for both characters. Well done. Bravo... Brilliant anti-conservative propaganda packaged in a bow of a nice movie!"

","This film is a great attempt at showing the political agendas incorporated into modern life. The film itself covers all bases with the central character, although ultimately being fictitious, playing the role of one of the most famous historical characters ever.<br/><br/>The title sounds really corny and by naming the central character 'v' it could be thought that the film would delve into the depths opened by other films of the same sounding (zorro for example) but it steers well clear and provides an enthralling and encapsulating viewing experience for all. I would have expected the top voters on the site to agree with this due to the flawless cinematography and 'matrix-esque' (original not sequels) fight scenes but everyone has their own opinion.<br/><br/>In this film i did not expect too much as usually historically-based films fall well short of the mark but this was completely the opposite reaction to the one produced by watching it. Lots of films this year have made me want to walk out but this one keeps you glued to your seat for the entire length, also making you hope it will stretch out even longer. The characters themselves make you feel emotionally attached and willing them to succeed in their goal and brilliant performances by Natalie portman and Hugo weaving make this one of the best films i have ever seen, so move it up the rankings!! Hopefully there will be more films of this quality produced in the next few years, and if there are there truly will be a future for film enthusiasts."

","In a future where Great Britain is a fascist state ruled by a Big Brother-like figure, a masked revolutionary wages war against the powers that be by terrorist means. This engaging drama is an impressive directorial debut for McTigue, who obviously has been influenced by the Wachowski brothers, with whom he worked on the Matrix films. The visual imagery is rather striking if sometimes overtly symbolic. Portman turns in a fine performance as a young woman who becomes allied with V, the masked man. Although we never see his face, Weaving brings surprising depth to the role of V. Ironically, Hurt, who tried to escape the oppression of Big Brother in ""Nineteen Eighty-Four,"" plays the Big Brother figure here."
"benn-rogers-1","9","0","2","11 October 2006"," A little review
","""Remember, remember, the fifth of November, the gunpowder treason and plot. I see no reason why gunpowder treason, Should ever be forgot."" The old rhyme of Bonfire Night comes out of the speakers, and then a story starts to be told. This is the beginning to V for Vendetta, a film about remembering treason and oppression.<br/><br/>It must be told that Bonfire Night on November fifth is a celebration in England of a failed attempt to blow up the House of Lords, in the Houses of Parliament in London, in 1605. Guy Fawkes was the man in the plot who was to blow it up. He was caught underneath the building with barrels of gunpowder. Fawkes was tortured and hanged along with the other conspirators.<br/><br/>The movie takes a new look at treason, here the hero is the terrorist V. V is a man in a mask; he wears a Guy Fawkes mask. Behind the mask and voice of V is Hugo Weaving, who does a remarkable version of the vandalistic villain on a very voracious vendetta (the best line by V is all to do with ""v"" words). The movie is set in the future, around 2040, in London. London has gone to a fascist government that has exterminated all the non-heterosexual-god- fearing-whites.<br/><br/>The audience falls in the middle of this dark oppressive world. The first character to be seen is Evey Hammond, played with perfection throughout by Natalie Portman. Evey is normal, if not stumbling into the terrorist V and running from police. It is not until the later half of the film does Evey become the character she needs to be to complete the films message. The scenes of just her are innocently powerful due to Portman's ability to just stare.<br/><br/>A very powerful cast supports Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving. Consisting of the comedian Stephen Fry, Stephen Rea who does a great job as the chief inspector, John Hurt who plays as the dictator of London, and Tim Pigott-Smith as Creedy. Creedy is the evilest man in the film, and Tim Pigott-Smith makes that possible with the surly looks he has at all times. The film also has a lot of recurring characters who represent the public, and the movie moves back to them as so one sees the change in public opinion. This is great since it truly makes the movie have such a great depth. Creating the ending to be such a greater climax than it would be with out them.<br/><br/>The action of the movie is very Matrix-ish, and why not since the creators of the Matrix films, the Wachowski brothers, also wrote the script for V for Vendetta. They use the slow motion fight scenes with all the blur and special effects quite soundly. The brothers even brought in the assistant director from the Matrix films to be the director of V for Vendetta. James McTeigue in his first film as Prime Director, and he shows he knows what to do. The movie has just flawless direction as it travels through the story.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a movie that divides it audience. Some see it as an anti-Christian anti- heterosexual and anti-American film. Others see it as a very core value American film. This is because of what the Wachowski brothers portray the future as and how it got there. The film is big on gay rights and the rights to privacy. Besides this after effect most come out of the theater liking it, even when they thought they would not."

","There is a fine line between subversion and revolution -- like the difference between courage and stupidity; it depends on the outcome. The word Terrorist is rather harsh for this film, as no non-combatants were ever targeted. Also, it was a little easier to take seeing the setting against another country. But the idea and ideal came through loud and clear. I have a sad feeling that somewhere in the world in the near future (from an historical perspective) the pure ideals upon which my government was founded will have to dust themselves off again and assert themselves. Makes me remember that I should never judge revolutionary ideas as subversive outright. A film about a terrorist or a freedom fighter? See it and decide for yourself. I especially like how the film reminded us that it does not take a superhero to change the world. Powerful stuff. Remember remember..."
"spooly_montana","9","0","3","27 September 2006"," Visceral feast for the senses.
","In 1999 the Wachowski Brothers brought us the first groundbreaking Matrix film, filled with cutting edge special effect techniques and an action film with no boundaries. On the heels of the Matrix Trilogy, the always mysterious creative duo bring us another veritable action extravaganza, V FOR VENDETTA. Behind the mask of the caped lead is actor Hugo Weaving, who played Agent Smith in The Matrix films. Based on Alan Moore's graphic novel published by Vertigo/DC Comics, the film is set in London, in the not too distant future. The formerly great United States is now apparently a leper colony, and Britain is ruled by an oppressive, authoritarian government where freedom is looked at as a liability in the effort to control the people. The stunned, complacent masses are kept in the dark from the truth of daily events by the government controlled media which manipulates them through propaganda and censorship. Along comes the caped freedom fighter 'V' (Weaving) who stirs things up for the ruling Chancellor and his forces with a show of explosives accompanied by a little Tchaikovsky music piped in simultaneously as the soundtrack. He conducts this ""performance"" from a nearby rooftop with Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman he rescued from a group of men in the streets earlier that night after she was out past the enforced curfew time. He politely forces her to view the massive spectacle alongside himself, the perpetrator. 'V' later takes Evey hostage to protect himself from being betrayed and caught. The ultimate objective of this charismatic madman is to blow up the Parliament building, giving the power back to the people and getting vengeance for events which led to his being burned and horribly scarred during some government endorsed experiments that went wrong. 'V' is uncompromising in his quest for revenge, and the government uses that to promote an atmosphere of fear, gaining an effective tool of control. The government is for the people, and if it is not, then upheaval must occur. The idea of freedom is eternal, and must be a guiding light for governments and the people ruled by those governments. Intentionally or not, the film does have some overtones of present social and political happenings, certainly here in the United States. But it is fiction, and fascinating at that. This film is quite ambitious, with some visuals that brought me back to Terry Gilliam's 1985 film Brazil. The Matrix creators have done it again with a stunning visceral feast for the senses. V for Vendetta is a moving, triumphantly electric, powerful political action thriller. Hugo Weaving does a good job behind the cover of his mask, a daunting task surely, and Natalie Portman flexes her acting muscles in the distressed, yet strong, role of the heroine Also starring in the movie are Stephen Rea, playing the detective tracking 'V' down and John Hurt playing the tyrannical Chancellor Adam Sutler. Is 'V' a terrorist or a freedom fighter? You decide."

","This movie was actually very good. It's interesting how Hugo Weaving played a character whose face you never saw. Hugo was the ELF KING in the Lord of the Rings. There were many good scenes in this movie such as the orchestra scene. Yes, there was a scene in which V conducts an orchestra where the sounds are from Hell. Was V good? I am not sure. Was he evil? Perhaps. All I know is that there is a new Hero in town, and his name is V. It's always great to see Natalie Portman deliver the goods. She sure does in this movie. There is a great deal of violence. V is ruthless and has no mercy for those who wronged him. He was messed up in a nuclear kind of experimentation and fire. I am still unsure of why he became so powerful. All I know is that I want to see a sequel to this."

A deadly virus has decimated America. Britain is ruled by a Fascist dictator. The British people live in constant fear of their government. One man is brave enough to fight the oppression--one man with a mask frozen in a haunting grin and a shadowy demeanor. He is known simply as V (Weaving). He becomes a thorn in the side of the government and a constant target of the police. But, to the British people, he becomes a symbol of hope...the one person willing to face possible execution for the sake of freedom. By mere coincidence, V meets Evey Hammond (Portman), a young woman who works at the local television station. After rescuing her from two vile night patrolmen, V takes Evey to witness his spark--the action that will trigger his year-long revolution. Now, Evey is a target of the government and must either join V in his monumental revolution, which will alter her life forever, or turn V into the police, which will allow her to go back to her normal life. And she must choose quickly, for, if she does not, the government, led by Chancellor Adam Sutler (Hurt), will make the decision for her.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" opened to critical praise, financial success, and a strong response from audiences everywhere. I skipped it in theaters, despite the wonderful word-of-mouth, for some forgotten reason, but I had been anticipating its DVD release for quite some time. Now, it is time for me to write my review and I find it very difficult to do so. ""V for Vendetta"" is a wonderfully-made movie, well-acted, beautifully-directed, and skillfully-written...though, it feels somewhat incomplete. As it progresses, we are notified of the events that have led up to the world appearing as it does. A deadly virus devastated America, killing most of the population. In fear of winding up like the unlucky Americans, the British elected a Fascist dictator who has, instead of protecting his people, used fear, terror, and murder to keep them in a constant state of surrender. The movie centers around what happens after this. It tells of V, the masked man who fights against the government over the duration of one year--from November 5th to November 5th. We understand all of these events...but what happens afterward? That is the problem.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" ends with the final stage of V's revolution--a massive event that calls for instant and dramatic change. However, the message that V lived for, ""Ideas Are Bulletproof!"", is the same idea that makes me question the ending. Yes, Parliament is gone and many of the Fascist leaders lay dead...though, there are still others. If this Fascist dictatorship is dead, then another government must be instituted and, if it is not, then V's revolution was rather ineffective. Will things change for the better? We can only hope so, though this film does not do much in the way of implying that. We must rely on ourselves to decipher the ending, which is not a completely negative thing, though I would have preferred it had the movie been twenty minutes longer and had provided more evidence, which we could have used to formulate our own ending. I like to think that the dictatorship ended that night--or at least began its descent-- but what type of government would take its place? Democracy? Absolute Monarchy? Anarchy? We cannot be sure. You see, V fought to end the government that was in place...but he did not have a replacement government.<br/><br/>Do not get me wrong. ""V for Vendetta"" is an amazing movie--a prime example of how movies should be made. They should not rely too heavily on special effects, but these effects should not necessarily be ruled out completely. The writing should be intelligent and should not try to dumb down serious matters for audiences incapable of forming a thought beyond their desire to see a big building explode. ""V for Vendetta"" makes its audience invest, not only time, but an ample amount of thought to understand the movie. The use of symbolism is amazing, especially the domino sequence. The grand finale, is easily one of the best scenes of the year and was utterly awe-inspiring. Despite the ending leaving much to be desired, ""V for Vendetta"" is truly a wonderful film--one of the year's best motion pictures. Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are exceptional, the pacing is rapid, and the script is wonderfully-written. As V so eloquently states, ""A building is a symbol, as is the act of destroying it. Symbols are given power by people. A symbol, in and of itself is powerless, but with enough people behind it, blowing up a building can change the world."" That statement sums up ""V for Vendetta"", as well. Scripts, by themselves, are powerless. But with enough competent filmmakers behind it, it can become so much more--a symbol that Hollywood still has some talent.<br/><br/>Final Thought: ""V for Vendetta"" is one of the year's best films, even though its ending could have been more complete.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9/10 (A)"

Performance of Hugo Weaving should be praised here. He expresses feelings of his personnage (V himself) only with body language and voice as V wears a mask. Other actors do their job rather well, but I didn't see outstanding performances.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, it could be seen as a political pamphlet, but some of the messages conveyed are too simplistic to be a strong backbone of the story (eg. ""democracy is better than tyranny"", ""don't be apathic in front of a unjust government"", etc.). There are many other political movies outthere (Z, I comme Icare, All the President's Men, 1984, Wag the Dog, etc.) that have more deeper and interesting messages.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't believe much in the totalitarian and isolated British regime depicted there, as everything looks like normal in daily life and everybody seems to find this normal as well. This is not very credible as most of the protagonists lived in the democratic society as we know it twenty years before.

","I had absolutely no interest in this film. Several friends said it was good, so I gave it a look. They were right. There's some pretty inflammatory material in this film that I actually have to applaud Hollywood for backing.<br/><br/>V FOR VENDETTA centers around a masked vigilante who employs terrorist-like techniques to try to bring down the corrupt government of futuristic England. A young girl is accidentally caught up in the mix and becomes his unwitting accomplice in his actions...<br/><br/>There's a whole lot more to V FOR VENDETTA's plot than the above, but it's probably better to watch it knowing as little as possible. A good mix of action, social-commentary, and cautionary tale - this film is far more than the typical comic-book action-fest that is so much more common from mainstream films. All the performances are top-notch, the action sequences are well done, and the plot is well-written. Definitely worth checking out...8.5/10"

","Unlike the overwhelming majority of contributors to this space, I suffer no delusions as to my abilities as a reviewer. I do, however, feel compelled to comment on a film that, quite frankly, surprised me. While the film's trailers promote it as being from the same folks who brought you ""The Matrix"", this movie is quite a different animal. Although all three installments of the ""Matrix"" trilogy were empowered with amazing special effects, the original, at least, remembered to include an interesting and intelligent story-line, which seems to have eluded the ensuing installments. In ""V for Vendetta"" the special effects have been minimalized, and the story-line enhanced, much to the better in both regards. It's a thought-provoking Orwellian tale of the future, well acted by an inspired cast. If you fancy yourself an intelligent movie-goer, you will have no trouble staying even, if not one step ahead, of the plot. The deft performances and superb staging of the scenes should be enough to carry you through these moments. Enjoy. It's a GOOD movie. Isn't that what cinema fantasy is all about?"
"jrosenf1","9","0","1","1 September 2006"," ""...violence can be used for good...justice...""
","That single line tells you all you need to know about the mindset of the title character, V (Hugo Weaving), who uses violence to get back at those who wronged him and his native England. But it isn't just simple, mindless violence that the masked terrorist uses to avenge his injustices; no, he uses a calculating form of destruction specifically designed to punish those responsible. And the results are both horrifying and gratifying at the same time.<br/><br/>We are introduced to V through Evey Hammond (Portman), an employee at the government-run news channel BTN. She is out after the imposed curfew and finds herself being detained by agents of the High Chancellor (John Hurt) called Finger agents. As they threaten to rape her, the masked figure emerges from the shadows and promptly slices up the men in order to save the girl. But rather than leave her there he takes her to his ""lair"", a plush retreat he calls the Shadow Gallery. Once there he reveals his intentions to Evey by showing her the fruits of his labor: the demolition of a downtown landmark and subsequent spread of panic and fear throughout London. ""People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people"" V tells her with voice that both comforts and chills. ""Are you going to kill more people""? ""Yes"" he answers flatly, and THAT line alone could win Weaving an Oscar- I still have chills down my spine from his heartless nonchalance regarding human life. <br/><br/>But as the tale unfolds we learn that it's not the lives of ordinary citizens that V is planning to terminate, but those of a select group of government leaders and influential community members. Why is the man in the Guy Fawkes mask vowing to carry out what British freedom fighter Fawkes and his co-conspirators could not do in 1605- bring down Parliament? Because those inside are responsible for the condition that V is currently in, burned and barely human, but determined to settle the score with those responsible. ""I've not come for what you'd hoped to do, I've come for what you've done"" he tells one of his victims as she pleads for mercy.""Are you going to kill me now""? she asks. ""I killed you 10 minutes ago"" he tells her. As his reign of revenge renders hypocritical higher-ups in pools of poison-filled puke, Evey is both mortified and mesmerized by the mysterious masked madman. And so was I.<br/><br/>A police officer, Chief Inspector Dietrich (Rea) has been trying to solve the case of who the man behind the mask is but every time he digs deeper into the past he is reminded to look away, or else. Still he continues to piece together the puzzle, and what he discovers puts the exploits of the terrorist in new light- V may have a just cause for his vendetta after all. The men in charge of the country are not the people they appear to be, but they are responsible for the state that their nation is in. On the 5th of November, the day that Fawkes is celebrated and one year after his reign of terror began, V will go out with a bang, bringing down Parliament and all of its' corrupt members. Or will it be his beautiful muse who lights the fuse?<br/><br/>Much has been said about this film glamorizing terrorism and demeaning government. After all, the central character is a debonair terrorist and the totalitarian government is portrayed as a controlling,corrupt, power-hungry entity. But I don't believe that the talented director, James McTiegue, nor the creator of the graphic novel the story is based on, Alan Moore, intended it to be seen in that light. It is what it is-a fun, fascinating, thought-provoking story that is like nothing ever seen before on film. It has been said to contain elements of everything from ""Batman"" to ""Phantom of the Opera"", but V FOR VENDETTA is a singular masterpiece that strips down the elements of today's society and asks us to examine what's inside. <br/><br/>Everything about this film stands out: the acting is top-notch; Weaving, wearing a mask the entire film, should easily earn an Oscar nod for his entrancing portrayal of the chilling villain, and Princess Amidala Portman finally conveyed a range of emotions, proving she's NOT just another (very) pretty face. The music was excellent, from the ""1812 Overature"" during V's destruction of property, to the golden oldies in his antique jukebox to the perfect closing number, the Stones' ""Street Fightin'Man"" (listen to the words). And the cinematography was simply amazing; the Wachowski Brothers ""Matrix"" influence could definitely be felt,especially in the awesome dagger showdown scene near the end. The lighting, colors, shadows and camera angles were all perfect and set the tone for an actual graphic novel come to life, without all the gimmicks of a ""Sin City"". All in all one of the best films I have seen in a long time and easily one of the best of the year, one that will remain in my head for a long time to come. It did not make me want to embrace terrorism and anarchy- it just made me want to think."
"dromasca","8","0","1","1 September 2006"," good cinema on a very problematic message
","'V for Vendetta' is one of the best comics-inspired movies ever made. It succeeds to bring to screen strong characters, yet it is faithful to its comics roots. It has a message, it sticks to it, and it transmits it in a efficient way to the viewer. However this message is disturbing and problematic.<br/><br/>The story happens a few decades from now. The US do not exist any longer, and Britain fell under the grip of a fascist regime, evolved from a Tory party that went wild. One man fights the wrong, lonely but powerful as any of the king of Superman or Spiderman. His goal is no less than to overturn the political system and tumble back the balance of power in favor of the people. The problem is that the Wachovsky brothers (authors of the script) and director James McTeigue are too good in making us believe that the futuristic recent history on screen is a direct continuation of our reality today, and so that what would have normally been the comic hero choreographic deeds may be looked in the light of a manifesto that justifies violence for political reasons.<br/><br/>It's a good cinema experience, and probably the best made entertainment movie done lately. There are many fine touches of British humor, and solid acting, with Natalie Portman giving a superb performance. If you watch it as entertainment, it's fine, but if you fall on the path of thinking to the implications beyond the story you may like it or not, as your political inclinations will start to interfere."

I do admit that certain elements that had little to do with V have been omitted, but the gist and the essence of the graphic novel could not be livelier in the film. Very few written materials are filmable page by page. Alan Moore apparently was not pleased with the script and decided to distance himself from the movie. He could not have been more unfair. Natalie Portman's performance may have been called unconvincing but I disagree, she does portray the ""imprisoned"" ,according to V, Eve well and Hugo Weaving has done a good job of being the enigmatic V whose lines are so lyrical and cleverly written. Yes the ending has been changed but that works to the story's advantage, it shows the grandeur of V's influence and that he has truly freed the English. In summary V for Vendetta is a well written comic book movie which does honor the novel."

The direction itself is basically a professional attribute. The characters draws you to the story's main idea and they are unique in ways different from other movie. My favorite character is V because he is flamboyant, literary, a fighter for freedom, and makes the movie so great. The plot and tag line, both complicated and epical but once you see the movie you get the idea. In watching the movie for a good hour in the theater I thought V would have sought for a normal revenge. But not.He plotted his revenge steps ahead the police and the government.

The creators of this film may have made suggestions pointing to that conclusion, be they unintentional or intentional (and I suspect they were intentional). Nothing could be further from the real truth. There are two points here. One, this is a revenge flick, Hence the title, V for Vendetta. And two, if there is any slap to be delivered here, it is against tyranny and dictators, such as Chairman Mao, Pol Pot, Tito, Stalin, Lenin, Hitler, Castro, Saddam, Ida Amin, Pinochet, Kim Jong II and countless other rulers who have cruelty exploited and brutally suppressed the masses in order to assume a totalitarian rule over a country (which also includes many of the Kings of England, France, and Russia). The themes of love, friendship, honor, justice, truth, devotion, and patriotism take a backseat. You may call them window-dressing, I would call them by-products.

","It is now August and I've seen em all. From An Inconvenient Truth to Da Vinci Code to Superman Returns to Miami Vice to Pirates of the Caribbean to Snakes on a Plane and to many more I've now seen all of the big movies and also some of the little ones that have come out from January to August of 06 and V for Vendetta is still the best I have seen all year.<br/><br/>Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore, V For Vendetta is essentially about a masked freedom fighter/terrorist named V (Hugo Weaving) who lives in Britain sometime not to soon from now. In around maybe 2020 I'd say. The country is run by a totalitarian/fascist government where everything and everyone is censored, controlled and watched according to the governments standards. V is the freedom fighter who rebels. Natalie Portman's character Evey is eventually dragged into V's rebellious/acts of terrorism that range from blowing up places to defying the government in every way possible and to his final act or rebellion which concludes the film. V sees what most people in this futuristic Britain don't that the government has used fear as the ultimate tool to gain total control of these people. V sees this and resents this. And further into the film we find out just really what the government did to turn Britain from a democratic country into a totalitarian/fascist country.<br/><br/>To say anymore could spoil it and to spoil this film would be a crime.<br/><br/>In a film that has many parallels to a lot of things in our world this totalitarian Britain might not be to far off for us. There is much to be found in the way of symbolism and allegories in this film.<br/><br/>The dialog in this film is awesome, one such example is a brilliant monologue where almost every other word starts with a V, that V gives in one of the first scenes of this movie. Many quotes from this movie will really make you think and will stay with you for a while because they speak true to how our society could become in the future, maybe even 20-30 years from now.<br/><br/>The acting by Natalie Portman is surprisingly good in this film considering she has been a bit off since Garden State in my opinion. Hugo Weaving although covered by a mask the entire film does a great job making you sympathize with this terrorist V as we see why he is like this. He also does a great job making V a poetic, intellectual, and passionate hero while still showing him as a ruthless and merciless killer. V is skilled in combat and the art of deception he is also a very very bright individual which makes him to be a great anti-hero.<br/><br/>The direction is also top notch here by James McTeigue. Every shot looks good and the explosions are all great especially the final scene which is captured beautifully. To say more about the final scene would give it away.<br/><br/>V For Vendetta has a lot to say about where it thinks society is going and my what a scary place the world will be if we are ever run by a government like the one in this movie. By a government who issues curfews, has only on TV station censored by them, who monitors families conversations, who's every bit of media has to be passed through them etc.<br/><br/>This movie is not just an action movie yet it's a social critique which has resounding similarities to the book 1984 by Orson Wells. In the end V For Vendetta comes out as a smart, dramatic action thriller that begs to ask the question is it considered terrorism if you know that what you are doing is right?"

","It could also be argued that this is also not your ordinary political dystopian nightmare,too. But this film is a merging of both film styles,which is why it's unique.<br/><br/>Set in London,England in the undisclosed future(I believe they aimed for about 2015 or 2020),the world's economic and military power has somehow shifted. A ""great war""that the U.S. started in the past has set into motion various smaller wars and various plagues has weakened America and shifted the balance of power to a new,neo-fascist England.This government is lorded by a choice few cabinet members and the face of the government is represented and headed by one Adam Sutler(John Hurt,once the watched by Big Brother,now doing the watching so to speak),the Lord Chancellor.<br/><br/>The rest of the country seems the same:people still go off to their office jobs,kids to school,people drinking their troubles away at the pubs. Everyone seems to be in front of their television sets. But the news and entertainment seem to be all tilted toward the state,with varying degrees of nationalistic froth. Also,the streets of the city are empty at night,due to state-wide curfew and bands of deputized thugs who prowl the area to detain and punish miscreants. <br/><br/>Through this setting swoops in V(an athletic Hugo Weaving,who could effectively hide in any crowd due to his work here,as well as the Matrix and LOTR films)who rescues vulnerable and pretty young television P.O. Evie(Natalie Portman,sexy,smart AND sympathetic). From there,V takes the girl under his wing and opens her up to his world(and in essence,to her own).<br/><br/>From there,V exacts his revenge on various members of government,past and present,all toward his ultimate piece-de-resistance:a Guy FAwkes day demolition of Big Ben. He is a character who takes to heart the image of Guy Fawkes(for whom the signature mask is modeled)and the ideals and modes of the Count of Monte Cristo to define his motivations,and this fascinates(inevitably)young and seemingly untouched Evie.<br/><br/>Hot on V's trail is a police detective(Stephen Rea,sobering)whose pursuit of the terrorist unveils some nasty truths that he nor his partner would seem to be ready to confront,but may have to just the same.<br/><br/>Plenty of back-story and a variety of character profiles buttress this film,giving it certainly the LOOK of a graphic novel. Director James McTiegue effectively builds a movie out of what appears to be(I haven't gotten more than a cursory look at the graphic novel)a very dense tome. Andy and Larry Warchowski co-wrote the script off David Lloyd's creation,and there DOES seem to be apparent traits of Matrix(i.e. a hostile future full of overlords and plenty of repressive violence). Supporting cast holds up well,particularly Tim Pigot-Smith (as a vile,government loyalist and toady),Sinead Cusack(as a government employed scientist and coroner,who happens to have a conscience),Roger Allan(a bombastic and Nazi-like patriot and propagandist),NAtasha Wightman(as an otherwise faceless prisoner) and Stephen Fry(as a droll and foolhardy talk show host and local celebrity).<br/><br/>This film is,unlike previous g.n. efforts like From Hell,League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,American Splendor(though unlike the previous two,this one seemed to hit better notes than the previous two),a twist of the concept of a sci-fi/action adventure film as a political message in that it seems that the message comes first,the action and dystopic images come in lock-step. Not escapist fare in the least,really,but an intriguing and(I feel)rewarding film all the same."

Dressed in a Guy Fawkes costume, he plots against the state (led by John Hurt's nasty Chancellor Adam Sutler) and the people responsible for both his mistreatment and the death of thousands.<br/><br/>Although the film is not 100% faithful to the minutiae of the comic strip, the movie's writers (The Wachowski Brothers) have wisely not strayed too far from Moore's basic vision, delivering a script that retains the core ideas (the importance of freedom and individuality) yet still has time for a little wham-bam action.<br/><br/>Whilst the movie is not a complete success (it's a tad too long and drags in a few places), this big-budget adaptation of the relatively unknown (to the general public, at least) V for Vendetta is a brave move and everyone involved should be applauded.

In short...it is not our story...but it should be. i have given it a 10(excellent) because it is what it is and ... after all...beauty is in the eye of the beholder!"

","This will go down as one of the best tag lines ever....I absolutely loved this movie...Hugo did an excellent job giving the villain ? more personality than most people I know....Natalie impressed the heck outta me with her performance as well....I loved her in the Star Wars trilogy but this movie really showed how good an actress she is. Great special effects, great character and storyline development, great action it has it all. I love movies that challenge me to think and look at another point of view. Especially one that doesn't hit you over the head while doing it. There are social, political and moral scenarios played out that can't help but make you think how easy it is to blur the lines and yet it still entertains you....it's a keeper for me."

","V for Vendetta explores many themes that struck a chord with me, particularly in today's political climate. The idea of fear being used as a smokescreen in order to deprive people of their civil liberties rang true- as did the Islamophobia, Homophobia and general disdain for any kind of human diversity.<br/><br/>It takes a while for the film to grow on you, but soon you will find yourself caring in the tale of Evie, a woman who is very much awakening to the ugliness around her, and is empowered enough to take action. There are some especially moving scenes- including Evie's torture and her discovery of the dead woman's letter. You will find yourself thinking of the strength of human spirit, and you will find yourself somewhat inspired.<br/><br/>The marketing has strongly associated the film with screenwriter the Warschowski Brothers. This could be potentially damaging because it really isn't an action film- and the fight sequences that are int his film don;t necessarily have the same visual flair as found in the Matrix movies. Instead we have a film that is far more broody and thoughtful, it's about characters growing, and pasts and agendas being revealed. In contrast the matrix's philosophical musings, particularly towards the end of the trilogy, often felt like window dressing, and sadly nonsensical and self important.<br/><br/>So watch this film with an open mind, and expect something different. You will be rewarded for it."

","Watched this last night on DVD and was mesmerised by the story with characters who you felt you knew and could ring and invite for a cup of tea. The story line is so relevant that I was at times overwhelmed and felt as though this was a view of the future of next week which scared the hell out of me. The most powerful scene for me was when the soldiers stood down and it reminded me of Tieneman square when that student stood in front of that tank and forced it to move around him. I am happy to say that this film is one of the greatest films I have ever seen and would recommend it to everybody. In addition it was great to see Stephen Rea again I had forgotten how excellent he is his understated performance was superb."
"dan-scribe","9","0","1","22 August 2006"," Vendetta asks questions we are finally ready for. **Mild spoiler**
","The late seventies kicked off a time of innocent magic for American culture and beyond. For fifteen years or so the most successful movies touched the imagination and thrilled audiences with stories of adventure and triumph. <br/><br/>But for the last decade an appetite for more than other people's adventures has been growing. Now we feel something deeper and desire something that touches who we are. We now find fleeting the delight from joy rides and tickled imaginations. We now face real threats from dark corners we don't understand. We feel more powerless than ever to shape the world and create gardens for ourselves. <br/><br/>Throughout the modern age different people with differing world views had one thing in common. We thought we knew ourselves and we spoke into the world according to our separate visions even if powerful individuals resisted us. <br/><br/>But we are post that time. The voice of the people has grown mostly silent. Our modern age certainties no longer work. We are tormented even more by our longing for restored certainty than we are by worldly threats. We are being mentored to ask questions again. To find peace and direction we sometimes gravitate to the stirring questions of others. <br/><br/>A few films in recent years are helping us ask questions about what we fear most. The film V for Vendetta echoed this question so loudly that only fireworks and explosions could give a fully punctuated answer. How striking that audiences could sympathize with V's motives for blowing up government buildings after condemning without question the officially identified perpetrators of Oklahoma City and 911! Perhaps it's because V asked also of us what he asked of Evey and the oppressed people of London. <br/><br/>Whether they realize it or not the Wachowski Brothers are asking us a crucial question that transcends politics. We can feel the question under our skins. Anyone who views this film non defensively will react emotionally because it is saturated with symbols that call up feelings in us that have fallen asleep. Virtually every character, word, circumstance, event and object in this film typifies something in the story of humankind and its' most troubling of all questions, ""Who are we?"".<br/><br/>There is something in the message of this film that makes us doubt ourselves. It arouses a longing to see more clearly and live more freely. If the question lingers it begins to nag at us. Like Evey in the movie will we lash out at the question refusing any answer? Will we hate it and call it evil? Or will we finally collapse under the weight of its' well intended persistence? Will we yield breathless to the truth it begs us to accept? Will we set our hearts free from fear and claim who we really are? Can we find the courage to stand firm stubbornly demanding truth and respect from those who presume to control us with fear? Evey's surrender in the rain is one of the most powerful and beautiful portrayals of rebirth every created on film. Her running was over, her fear was gone. Don't we all long to have that?<br/><br/>People are filled with many fears. From the time we are born we collect them like bad habits. Fears are malignancies upon the human spirit. We fail to answer threats because we fear injury and death. We fail to make wise choices because we fear boredom. We fail to ask troubling questions because we fear rejection. We fail to fight injustice because we fear retribution. We fail to serve because we fear interruption of our comforts. <br/><br/>Who are we?<br/><br/>We could all be free but most of us prefer license. We prefer slavery because living without fear is costly. Freedom is only for ""the vigilant and the virtuous"". It must be stubbornly defended in the world as well as in our hearts. Slavish fear of bad governments is no more oppressive than our selfish addictions. The lies, guns and unjust laws of tyrants are only possible among a people already dominated by greed, control impulses, victim-hood, and prejudice. <br/><br/>Constant love is available but we still crave gratification like children. Love is costly because it calls us to forget ourselves and die if necessary to benefit others. <br/><br/>We can find truth if we're willing to pay the price but we kowtow to safety and convenience. Commitment to truth is painful because it more often humbles us than promotes our agenda. Truth is illusive and risky because it often comes in stages that can be mistaken for lies. <br/><br/>Who are we?<br/><br/>Our fears make us unwilling to accept who we really are. But we've always known it deep down. We are human beings. Our creative souls reject the insult that we are nothing more than accidents of time and chance. We know we were created for something more than slavery. We were created for a purposeto carry the likeness of One who knows no fear but weeps so bitterly for us that He chose death in order to destroy the power of fear and give us hope for a new world. We're drawn to the character V because a story like his is written in our DNA. We were designed to speak as V speaks. We were born to have no fear of death so nothing evil could make us slaves. But alas, those who use fear to gain power over our laws, our markets, and our appetites also use fear to close our eyes and our ears to any message that might set us free. <br/><br/>The fortress of deceit and fear has long been destroyed. The promise has been kept. The offer of freedom remains. But ""there is no certainty, only opportunity."""

I know that this maybe sounds like a vindication to the anarchy or the chaos, but I think that the intentions of the filmmakers of this production was to make a movie that make us think about our responsibilities as citizens in order to keep our government in control.

","Everyone needs to see this movie. EVERYONE. I saw this in theaters the first day it came out and bought it on it's release date. It's amazing! The acting is great and the dialog is very well thought out and clever. This has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen and it's definitely one of my favorites. No one could have portrayed V quite like Hugo Weaving did, he was perfect for the part and gave V a certain strength, emotional depth and more humanity than I think any other actor could have done for this masked hero. V For Vendetta has a conscience and an overwhelming sense of conviction. This is one of the most powerful and moving films I have ever seen. It possesses all of the elements necessary to comprise a perfect movie: fantastic acting and a very well written script, action, romance, philosophy, twists and a purpose. The premise of V For Vendetta hits close to home because it deals with a terrorist, V, who is also a hero and a genius, he is a man and an idea, and he is a strong standing force of nature. V For Vendetta illustrates all that is wrong, all that could be wrong, and all that can be done. This film is eloquent, exciting, and above all it is remarkably well done."
"fwomp","8","0","1","19 August 2006"," Connect The Dots And See Where V Leads You
","A science fiction film with a message. Who would've thought it possible. I don't mean this has never happened, it's just that it hasn't happened in quite some time. To put it in perspective, my favorite SF film was THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL. Although many people make that claim, here it is noteworthy because The Day The Earth Stood Still was a brave undertaking, commenting on the dangers of nuclear technology during a time when our government and our country felt this was a necessary evil. I'm not saying V FOR VENDETTA rates up on the same level, but it does have its moments, making us question the purpose of government and the repercussions of overstepping those purposes for its own ""good"" rather than the individuals it's supposed to serve.<br/><br/>Coming from the Wachowski brothers who made THE MATRIX trilogy, V has a good cast realized via the comic book of the same name but takes a while to get on track. The first third of the film was pretty slow and involved, but the latter parts made up for this.<br/><br/>The story is about a masked man named V (Hugo Weaving, THE LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy) who was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical company. A group of men and women have hidden their involvement with this distasteful part of history as we lunge forward to the year 2020. A totalitarian government rules England, cowing its citizens by enforcing curfews, limiting religious freedoms, and eliminating homosexuality (if you're a gay Buddhist out after nine p.m. you're in BIG trouble!) Weaving a bit of history into the story, we see Guy Fawkes Day (November 5th) taken to a whole new level. V plans to destroy Parliament because of its wickedness and the fear under which English citizens now live. Not to mention that Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt, CONTACT) is one of the pharmaceutical founders that altered V's life forever; V has no recollection of his past, including his own name, and has an altered body chemistry allowing him superhuman agility thanks to the drugs that were tested on him. This is very bad news for those involved in screwing up his life. V is out for Vengeance, too.<br/><br/>But V is also lonely, so when Evey (Natalie Portman, STAR WARS III) helps him make good an escape, he pulls her into his confidence, eventually forcing her to lose all her fears through a set of brutal tests. In Evey V sees the future of mankind, a sign that all may be made right with the world.<br/><br/>In a stunning climax, we watch V's vision come to life, as fireworks blow, thousands turn out wearing Guy Fawkes/V masks, and Evey comes to understand how important change is in the world.<br/><br/>This film certainly won't be for everyone. You have to think about what's happening to really understand the message. It doesn't smack you in the face with an obvious plot, and instead lets it seep into the viewer's subconscious.<br/><br/>There are, as seen in other reviews, a lot of talk about what this film's intent was supposed to be, and I think that speaks pretty highly for the level of sophistication needed to help one grasp V. Is he a freedom fighter or a terrorist? Anyone who wants to destroy a government must be crazy and/or an anarchist, right? How far is too far when a government wants to ""protect"" its citizens? These are questions the movie poses but doesn't give answers to, and that is quite refreshing considering what Hollywood usually places in front of us (A + B = C). Connect your own dots and see where V leads you."
"softwarenerd","9","0","1","19 August 2006"," Swashbuckling on steroids
","An enjoyable movie, set in a dystopia, where the hero fights for freedom, this movie does justice to the ""swashbuckler"" genre. It rises above the average movie of the genre, which tend to be a series of disconnected fight-scenes, with a well-integrated and detailed plot and broader themes.<br/><br/>Some who've read the book on which the movie is based have commented that it is anarchistic; the movie does not reflect this. Some who've seen the movie have criticized the negative portrayal of government; but, compared to the typical ""military-industrial complex"" villains, this movie does a pretty good job of depicting a religious-fascist gang that takes control of a country by playing on fear.<br/><br/>The political theme of the movie is that people can rise up an make a difference, instead of taking their oppression lying down; but there's a more subtle theme played out in the sub-plot: that life is not just staying alive at any cost. A human being can reach a point where he will rebel rather than being a slave, even at the risk of death."
"efeedor1","8","0","1","18 August 2006"," V for Virtue
","I went into ""V for Vendetta"" skeptically. All of my friends had raved about it, said it touched on all the hot political issues of today. I was worried this would be another shallow adolescent fantasy masquerading as deep and artful  a comic book future so dark and gloomy it couldn't but be compared to ""1984."" Oh, ""V for Vendetta"" reeks of adolescent fantasy, and packs on the Orwellian clichés in the hammiest of ways, but it is not superficial, and it is not dumb. And, best of all  and despite a daunting running time of two hours and twelve minutes  it was solidly entertaining.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" has its sloppy moments, of course. Natalie Portman is mostly flat and touts an equally flat English accent; in one scene, her character makes a betrayal and escape with little apparent motivation. Her TV show host friend has an episode of his show lampooning the totalitarian state's dictator. He's punished, of course, but in this vision of the future, is it really probable that it would even be allowed to be aired? Another lapse in common sense is V's apparent singularity in his fight against the corrupt government. There is so little about how he single-handedly plans his offensives or gathers the materials necessary, despite heavy (though not overwhelming) exposition of his background. However, the film does not need to be logical on that level, so it does not try, and it is so entertaining and fantastical, that the audience would neither notice nor care.<br/><br/>The charm of this movie is that the action and adventure is not firmly rooted in the modern comic book epics and Tarrantino-esquire pulp fiction. Instead, the film is more indebted to the old romantic fantasies of Alexandre Dumas, or at least the swashbuckling movie adventurers of the thirties that he inspired. (V's favorite film is ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and he prefers sword over gun.) Our hero is always masked in a musketeer's costume (attributed to a seventeenth century dissident who tried to blow up parliament), and always speaks with hyperbolic literacy and enunciation. Hugo Weaving plays the part with just enough hamminess and old-fashioned romance. Hammy, too, are the bad guys. And the film is innocent enough to still show the evil chancellor's head on a gigantic screen overlooking his tiny henchmen  in clear defiance of ""Austin Powers"" spoofing.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta""'s selling point, however, is its 'controversial' politicking, and, to my surprise, the agit-prop ploy worked. The Wachowskis' script has filled the film to the brim with obvious parallels to today's world, but the obviousness is simple, pure and un-clandestine. Furthermore, it does not ring false. Fortunately or not, today's volatile situation seems to fit into the film's ""1984"" fantasy like hand in glove. When boiled to their essences, the problems of today are so insidious that they're believable as the troubles in this fairy tale world of good versus evil, and the movie knows that we know that it's a mass oversimplification, so it retains its swashbuckling charm, and never tries to outsmart us, or crash and burn in a futile attempt to become 'sophisticated.' Even though a bleeding-heart subplot of lesbian lovers seems tacked on, and there's a jail sequence that becomes ridiculously improbable, the movie can be forgiven because the filmmakers seem so naïvely earnest, and move the film along at a brisk, engaging pace. It's refreshing to see a movie that is so firm in its convictions that it would even condone 'terrorism' as a means of getting to freedom and fraternity. This is probably the most radical mainstream hit since the pre-9/11 ""Fight Club,"" though this film is not as crafty or offensive as ""Fight Club"" was in some instances.<br/><br/>""V for Vendetta"" is straight, simple, fun, silly, commercial entertainment that becomes an unlikely countercultural classic; it has the guts to call its audience to stand up to tyranny, even if it's not abroad. Though set in Britain, ""V for Vendetta"" has perhaps the most unabashedly American spirit ever to find its way into an American blockbuster."
"ashkxii","9","0","1","18 August 2006"," Great story, well executed
","From screenwriters and assistant director of the Matrix trilogy, comes an interesting movie that depicts England in near future. If you expect to see people using cool gadgets or driving flying cars, people eating each other, Aliens ruling the earth, or humans become mutants, you will be disappointed. The movie does focus on the political aspects that may happen in the future and in a very convincing way. West has become middle east. Totalitarianism rules Great Britain and freedom has been suppressed viciously. London is ready to explode waiting for a spark. ""V"", the revolutionary fighter, delivers that spark. This is the story of uprising against tyranny, unity, love, and revenge. V for Vendetta is a combination of Phantom of the opera, Batman, 12 Monkeys, and Matrix but in a good way. It has couple of cool semi-Matrix-like action scenes with lots of twists and an interesting love story. Screen play is strong, performances are brilliant, and it's a great debut for James McTeigue as a director (assistant director of Matrix and Star Wars-Episode II)."

","We live in an era that is tough to satirize since the fake newscasts in this movie are indistinguishable from Fox News, and the lies, crimes, and fear-mongering of the government to protect their corporate masters were actually a bit understated compared to what we see in America now.<br/><br/>The only false note was John Hurt as the angry, yelling dictator, Sutler. Even our own president, the Texas Tard, does't blow up like that, though if he did, it would probably make some people love him more.<br/><br/>The question this left me with is how bad things have to get in real life before people react. Obviously, the random arrests of Muslim Americans including an Army chaplain, domestic eavesdropping without warrants, and even an unprovoked war against a country that couldn't harm us are not enough. We could probably get as far as open dictatorship like in this movie, and it would only bother people enough to make them crack open another beer."

","The Graphic novel V for Vendetta was a piece of art, and an interesting comment to society that still holds a decent level of relevance seventeen years later. Question is how well this is translated to the silver screen. I'd say pretty good, make no mistake though, a lot have been changed, but seeing as there's a seventeen-year gap between the novel and the movie, and the idea of what is a 'near future' also have moved seventeen years. When you judge this movie, it's a bad idea to compare it to the book, so I will leave the matter of comparing them by saying there was some removed or altered scenes I missed, but that there were some added scenes I enjoyed. The acting in this movie is in general very good, with Hugo Weaving as the masked terrorist madman we all love, as a main attraction of sorts. The special effects are also nice, and the pyrotechnics in the start and end are truly breathtaking, especially mixed with the classical music added. The lighting and camera usage is also interesting, used in many cases to add more emotion to V's mask, most notably under Vs last fatal encounter with the authorities. The plot isn't too bad either, and flows well. All in all, this movie is a feast for both mind and eyes, but will possibly fail to satisfy if you've read the novel."

I want to go to a movie to relax, not to think too hard. On top of that I felt that it was encouraging people to become protesters or terrorists, two things that I detest. The actors were well suited for their roles, their acting was excellent, and the scenes were excellent but I was not happy with the message/plot and it left too many unanswered questions.

This movie is definitely a keeper in my opinion, one that you would want to go and watch over and over because there's so many different things that you can get out of it, and so many different opinions that you can form. In a way it brought older styles together with newer styles and some futuristic types, the sword scenes were awesome and beautifully done.

"MeloDee","7","0","2","12 August 2006"," An entertaining film with not so entertaining holes.
","When the movie begins, we see Prothero, one of the members of the fascist government of Chancellor Adam Sutler, speaking on the screen. I could not help but laugh at his speech, that included phrases about ""judgment"" and ""Don't you think He's watching""- the latter made with eyes rolled upwards and a finger pointed to the sky. Finally his confession, ""I am a man of faith"" thrown in there to top it all off.<br/><br/>Yes, the entire movie is a parody- a completely extreme, twisted, and comical version of reality.<br/><br/>Yes, we all remember a world when witches, homosexuals, and adulterers were burned at the stake by Christians. The modern governments of the Western world, however, have stopped these practices. 10-20 years from now- the time period in which the movie is set, I expect that gay marriage would be legal, and gays accepted and supported. A leader like Chancellor Sutler would never be elected, even in a ""time of crisis and war"" as the movie depicts.<br/><br/>What started the crisis and war is in itself extremely sketchy. That's because this movie just doesn't flow from event to event the way it should. What V was actually fighting for was blurry.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie we see Nazi-like curfews, ""Unity Through Faith"" signs all over the place, government lies and censorship and grossly unfair trials and imprisonment.<br/><br/>(can someone say, jab at Guantanemo Bay?) This however, isn't enough to wake people out of complacency. The idea becomes, ""I'll just do what the government says, and not get hurt."" Now what we didn't see- things addressed only a few times- such as the government poisoning it's own people (and pinning it on Muslim terrorists), the tragic story told by ""Valerie"" depicting the imprisonment of homosexuals, and of course, the outlawing of Islam- should've been causing quite a stir.<br/><br/>First off, I again doubt that a ""deeply religious Conservative"" (that ring any bells?) preaching ""Unity through Faith"" would seek to achieve it by poisoning his own people and making sure that only the government has the cure. I mean, come on. If you're going to make a fascist Christian, please make him realistic.<br/><br/>Secondly, as I said before, gays would be widely accepted and supported. People would not sit by and let that to happen to them.<br/><br/>As for the fact that owning a Koran would result in death? A lot of people forget that England has a large Arabic minority, some of which are doubtless Muslims. Islamic people don't just sit by and let things like that happen to them. The result would be a bloody, endless war.<br/><br/>We didn't see any of that. In fact, the only thing V actually insulted in his pre-Jordan-Tower-destructing speech was the government suppression of ""ideas"" and the ambiguous but familiar sentence, ""something is wrong with this country."" As I mentioned, ideas weren't suppressed enough to actually drive the people we typically saw to revolution.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that the movie wasn't entertaining- because, it was. We have a dark, masked man with pretty knives, who systematically kills members of the fascist party, both for their involvement in his mutation? and burning as well as for their creation of the virus and the atrocities committed in the process. He leaves roses on their corpses. Let's not forget his rhymes, fetish for alliterations beginning with ""V"" and obsession with lovely music and fireworks.<br/><br/>Also, speaking of which, why on earth would the government seize and outlaw 40s movies, old jazz music, and Greco- Roman paintings and statues? V tells Evey that he stole them from the government as they survey them in his house.<br/><br/>Also, why did Chancellor Sutler have all the real butter? There was no reason. The government was just horrible, bad, and greedy because it was just that.<br/><br/>As for V, I didn't see him as the hero that he was portrayed as. I saw him as a vengeful psycho, and truth be told couldn't understand much of what he was trying to say or do. It got even more confusing when he started falling in love with Evey. I don't know if that was Lloyd's or the Waschowski brothers' fault. They promised to eliminate masked hero stereotypes, but they forgot to eliminate the biggest of all; the one where a ""dark protagonist"" falls in love with an ""angel"" and his black heart is enlightened to some new truth.<br/><br/>Then, of course, there was when V spoke one of the worst lines in movie history, after a final battle that looked a lot like I'd heard it described- a mix of Equilibrium and the Matrix. Was it cool? Yes- but they could've done better.<br/><br/>Anyway, Creedey shoots him and says, ""Why won't you die?"" To which V responds, ""Under this mask, there is more than than skin, muscle and bone. There is an idea, Mr. Creedey, and ideas never die."" That was almost as bad as, ""Do you know what happens to a toad that's struck by lightening?"" Now, after wading through the disjointedness- which, is unexpected when you're trying to make a romance, superhero film, political thriller, action movie, AND adaptation of a graphic novel all at the same time- and leftist/liberal propaganda, I actually found a gem in there somewhere.<br/><br/>A little before the fated November the 5th, V tests Evey by creating a scenario in which she is captured by the ""police"", and she refuses to give any information about his whereabouts. She is tortured, and finally scheduled to be shot.<br/><br/>V's excuse? He wanted her to become free of fear. He wanted her to see, that you shouldn't be afraid to die for what you think is right. V's method for getting the truth to her was questionable- as most things he did were in my opinion- but I think that's a universal message for us all."
"jwb73","9","0","1","12 August 2006"," Valuable despite its flaws
","In many ways this film tries very hard to give a different perspective and definition on certain things in our current world. Many times it fails to truly give a valuable meaning, but in many ways it succeeds. Obviously this movie is very far-fetched in terms of its realistic content, much akin to Batman or The Crow or any other victim/hero movie. However, its underlying messages and direct comparisons to reality are what it attempts to deliver. Our current world definitions seem to be built around such words as ""Terrorist"" and ""Patriot fighter."" It is my firm belief that neither of these words are accurate. Neither word is justified. This movie tries to show exactly why this is, however, I am not sure it succeeds fully. The main character ""V"" is cast as a criminal vigilante who is a threat to the entire sanctity of a country. His acts of blowing up buildings and killing law enforcement officials seem to warrant this idea. The true reality of this is quite the paradox when we learn of V's past and identify with how the government of this society behaves. The government (much akin to our own) tries very hard to hide important events and actions it takes to keep control and order amongst the people. The cruel reality of this society is that it claims to be sovereign and free, but underneath it is very much the opposite. In our own real-world society here in the United States we our seeing many parallels to what is seen in this film. Our own government uses lies and words such as ""Terrorism"" to control its populous in to giving up its valuable rights and freedoms to allow itself more control and power to do what is ""necessary"" to eliminate those that oppose it. Each day we sacrifice our freedoms and our feelings to feel more safe. Why do we do this? It isn't because those that bomb us are hateful evil people...they are often times oppressed or slandered by our own government. We sit here and think of such events as 9/11, and while these events are cruel and unjust to those that have suffered we must realize that no one views themselves as the ""bad guy."" There are reasons for what happens in life, and while I do not justify 9/11, i also do not see the people we war with as ""terrorists."" Have you ever thought of the thousands upon thousands of innocent people the U.S. forces have killed? Probably not. Imagine yourself as an innocent man or woman living in a war torn society like Iraq...imagine one day that U.S. warplanes drop bombs on your homes and kill your spouses and children...these are things that happen and have happened before and after 9/11. These thoughts are never claimed because people tend to not see much further than what is beyond their own line of sight. As well we are guilty of being ignorant and remaining so of our own government activities. More laws and acts will come , much like the evil Patriot Act. Our government will continue to use excuses to keep us in the dark and to keep taking our own rights away. As this movie states, but not clearly enough, ""People should not be afraid op their government...the government should be afraid of their people."" We need to change this country."

","""V for Vendetta"" had a great initial material in the form of a great Alan Moore's comic book. To my mind, the flick didn't waste it and, what's more, retained a climate of a comic but not exactly its letter. Wachowscy did a great job transforming a comic book into a movie. Most of the decisions they made seems appropriate to me. The acting also is sensational. The film provides wise entertainment and is emotionally powerful thanks to Natalie Portman. Furthermore, the movie somehow relates to the contemporary political situation and, what is the most important, persuades into thinking. In particular, two scenes are amazing. First one is the TV show a la Benny Hill and the second one is the final scene in which a motif of everyman is used. Highly recommended."

","i must have gone in the first time with really high expectations, 'cause i was a bit disappointed. but on DVD at home it was really a much richer experience. i have the say, the subtitling helped a bit -- the dialogue doesn't slow down for people in America, who would definitely have trouble with English vernacular and all the historical references. i'm a life-long Californian and i love it here, but let's face it, the educational standard for mainstream moviegoers is sub-par, at best.<br/><br/>the acting was great. it takes a lot of talent for someone to deliver as much emotional punch as Weaving does behind a mask. his delivery, intonations and gesticulations are masterful. (this assumes it really is him behind the mask at all times.) Portman is also good, but her English accent is forced at times, and makes her a bit stilted. Hurt as the High Chancellor, and Pigott-whatshisname as Creedy are outstanding. Rea as the detective / conscience of the people is great.<br/><br/>the set designs and production value are outstanding. visually it's a very rich film, using a full range of color to emphasize content. my favorite use of it probably was the narrative sequence when Portman is imprisoned and tortured.<br/><br/>i don't usually laud plot points. to me, film these days is much more about character and dialogue. but the plot here is intricate and well thought out, picking up pace at the right moments to keep you engaged. the fervor and maniacal devotion that V has to his goals could only be properly rendered with an equal amount of attention to detail, and the Wachowskis achieve that goal.<br/><br/>the editing wasn't right. there are several moments where a plot point or political concept has to breathe for a moment and sink in. it cuts too quick to the next scene; it's jarring. i'm too lazy to open another tab and find out who it was, but whoever you are, read Murch's book already.<br/><br/>for the people that don't like the domino scene: i didn't appreciate it much either, the first time around. with everything that's going on in the film, you wonder why V takes what must have been a ridiculous amount of time to build an elaborate pattern of dominos. obviously, it's a visual device to tie in with Rea's narration on connectivity. but, again, the second time around, things seem to fit better. i think, additionally, it shows V's obsession with detail, connectivity and coincidence. and it's a great visual to crosscut with Rea's character realizing that everything is linked."

","this is not a bad movie. As far as the cinematography and the storytelling of this movie go, it is one of the best I have seen in a long while. It is an excellent mix of story telling and plot development, and the action scenes may act to keep people interested in it that are not so inclined to watch movies like this. As far as being a social commentary goes, I disagree with anybody that says this a legitimate one. The fact that the tools of fear and subterfuge belong to anyone other than the media that produces these movies is far-fetched. Playing on fear is a tool of the media, far more than any government. Just my opinion, but this is not set in the US for the sole reason that the US public would have burned it self out long before getting in this position, before we needed these actions to before it happened."

","STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh <br/><br/>Set in a futuristic London, with a conservative freak named Adam Sutler (John Hurt) as the ruler and an oppressive, totalitarian regime in place that denies people freedom of speech, religion and love. Modelling himself against that other hero against oppression Guy Fawkes, a masked figure named V (Hugo Weaving) saves a woman from being raped by two corrupt policemen before bombing two famous London landmarks in an act of rebellion against the oppressors. He then high jacks a TV station and broadcasts a message to the people of London urging them to join him and rise up against the forces of oppression. Unfortunately in making his escape, the woman he rescued the night before, reporter Evey (Natalie Portman) he is forced to kidnap and hold against her will. But in doing so, he is able to open her eyes to the truth before midnight strikes and he rounds off his campaign of terror?/freedom fighting with one big act that will shake the very foundation of the present society.<br/><br/>I have never read the novel this film is based on, but I can only hope that if I ever do, it makes for more satisfying entertainment than this misguided action film. It's unfortunate the film doesn't work in the end, because V is certainly a very interesting and compelling hero/anti-hero, fighting for the causes of what he sees as good by using methods that might be employed by terrorists fighting for evil, cleverly used as a metaphor of Guy Fawkes rising against the tyranny of James I, well written and engagingly played by Hugo Weaving. In our modern age of September 11 and July 7, it's very daring for the film-makers to portray such a character and not attract a lot of backlash against such a film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in concentrating so much on making VFV a massive political statement about the folly of tyranny and oppression, the film seems to forget it's meant to be an action film and becomes a lot of talk and banter, with little in the way of exciting, juicy action on display. Stretching at over two hours, this makes it quite a long haul to sit through and while the sermonizing and twisty/turny story can't be ignored, it's just not what you payed for. **"

","A powerful movie that you will remember and find yourself referring to in the distant future, like Blade Runner. Another strong performance by Natalie Portman. I have been a fan of her work since her debut in ""Beautiful Girls"" (1996). Her political transformation is at the heart of this movie. The story speaks to a world of political repression by a Big Brother government in a world of the future. I think that the movie appears now in response to our eroding liberties in the new millennium. I expect more movies with this rebellious theme to appear in the next few years. This is the only movie that I have rated an ""A"" so far this year (Aug.2006)."

Even though I have to admit I was scarred, because of the simple fact that this movie was made by the makers of The Matrix, I thought it was going to be once again all glam and green screen, when actually, it turned out to be a good movie.<br/><br/>There are still a few things I'm not too sure about plot wise, I never did read the comics. But I am planning on watching this film again. I'm more for the look of the movie. Especially the domino scene, how cool was that? Dominos have never looked so cool. V for Vendetta not only looks good, the plot was still a great one as well. I loved the chemistry between Evey and V, they worked so well together. I loved how V tested Evey on her loyalty to him. It was like the bad good scene that I wanted to cry for.<br/><br/>It's a good movie that I would recommend for a good time. Still, once again #148 on the top 250, I'm not sure it's that good.

"bookdoggy","10","0","2","5 August 2006"," A Great Translaton of the Comic to Film
","The translation of the graphic novel to popular movie format was done quiet well. With only about 2 hours to go with the story, each move to combine events (such as the bombing of the Parliament building with the bombing of the statue of ""Justice""), or transform them from more personal or specific experiences (the mask only being worn by V and his successor) to broader, popularized forms (the masks being worn by the entire working-class population of London) was very clever. Also, the movie's central and most notable and important ""sexual relationship"" is not between V and Evey Hammond, but really between two anonymous lesbians who were murdered by the state - and this is in a modern popular film!<br/><br/>As the original creator of the story Alan Moore should not have misgivings about this movie. That the film did not mention that V is an anti-capitalist anarchist should not matter since the message is still made clear. The basic idea that corporations, capitalism, the state and nationalism are an affront to the freedom of the individual should be obvious to any viewer - or at least lead them to eventually form these conclusions if they are any kind of seeker of truth. The film is a triumph."

","""V for Vendetta"" follows the adventure of the orphaned Evey Hammond as she becomes involved with a mysterious Guy Fawkes-like freedom fighter known only as ""V"". The film is an exciting and worthy adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name.<br/><br/>The film lacks the more complex and character-driven plot of the graphic novels, instead concentrating more on the collective fortunes of a nightmarish future totalitarian England. As a result it has less to say about the politics of fascism and anarchy but moves along at a faster and more engaging pace.<br/><br/>The efforts to update the story from the 1980s to the 21st century are imaginative and for the most part work well whilst remaining largely true to the ideas underpinning the original. The relevance of much of the back story makes the film more daring and topical than its genre counterparts.<br/><br/>Most importantly, Hugo Weaving captures the essence of ""V"", the central protagonist, perfectly. Natalie Portman is less convincing as the naive Evey but is by no means bad.<br/><br/>Despite the efforts of the talented and largely British additional cast, the American writing and direction means the picture doesn't really 'feel' like England. As a result, much of the impact of an alternate reality is lost, making the film more of an out-and-out fantasy.<br/><br/>The film's ending is conclusive enough to leave one with the feeling of having experienced a complete package. In addition, the finale is sufficiently spectacular and rewarding to make the whole exercise a worthwhile one."

","Well, every good part of the movie was taken from the book, and half of it which was rewritten is terrible. They have changed so much for commercial reasons, flattened the story, simplified it, took every human aspect away. The movie could be made without changes and would still sell, but no. The party leader isn't a man in the movie rather an angry, dumb psychotic face on an lcd screen. One of the best parts originally was the his humanity, his complexes his love for his nation. They changed the story line, the ending is different (beggining too) excellent characters were taken out, great points of the plot. The Kitch rules. There are two good actors, Nataly Portman (surprisingly) and Stephen Rea, most others are written too simply to have a chance to act bad. The technology the Brothers added - giant lcd screens, new age computers - also make it worse.<br/><br/>Beside the bad points, the movie has beautiful shots in it, although i still liked these shots better in the comics (really). If you haven't read the graphic novel than you'll enjoy it more than i did, but if you enjoyed it you must read the book, you'll like it more it will also explain many things you didn't understand because of the missing scenes.<br/><br/>I'm not saying not to watch it, - watch it, but wait for it to come out on TV, the theater screen is either for excellent movies or for ones that there's no point to watch without the special feel the theater gives to the visual and sound effects (lord of the rings). This one is neither."

","I think the fact that Alan Moore himself would have nothing to do with this film is a fairly clear indicator that something's wrong with it.<br/><br/>As a fan of the aesthetically beautiful and affecting graphic novel, I wasn't short of feeling queasy when the finale of this film finally arrived.<br/><br/>Distorted beyond recognition, the screenplay became vacuous and bland; extra characters appeared as if from nowhere to fill up newly created plot holes, adding nothing to story except confusion. Vital and key moments of the tale are left unnecessarily unexplained (how V made his escape from Larkhill), while new features twist and change the whole mood of what should be a stark story (Steven Fry's character, the mass distribution of masks etc.) By this change of focus, I didn't care nearly as much about V or Evie's screen personas as I did about their printed ones. Although, to his credit, Hugo Weaving tries very hard with a concept that would never work in this film - complex (sometimes mad) expression through a mask. The entire ending is preposterous (bar the original ideas; blowing up the houses of parliament is a classic), and dare I say it, cheesy in the extreme. Portman's 'heart rending' speech (not to mention consistently dreadful accent) while we see the faces of 'the everyman' makes you reach for the bucket, and is a highly unsatisfying ending to what was an uninspired film to start with.<br/><br/>People I know who arn't lucky enough to have read Moore's original in print have raved about this film. And, I suppose, maybe it does stand up, even if you don't have the context (although I fail to see how many would find this mish-mash any less than confusing). It seems to me, however, that this had the potential to be a stark and affecting film, with massive cult potential, showing a decent representation of its source material.

","So first off, the message of the movie is maybe overdone. However, I think for the setting of the movie, it is something that most people can agree on. Some conservatives may feel that this movie is a direct attack on them, and i assure them that it should not be. The evil party in this movie is the conservative party, but it has taken a fascist sense in this portrayal. It also takes fills a more international role as it already uses the USA as a past failure. If there was one thing in that movie that made me think, it was that the USA could be subject to such chaos. Anyway, the message is rather inspiring and I think should be taken with an open mind. The problem displayed in this movie is more severe than today's quandaries are. It really is something to think about, but rather than to revolt when things really go wrong, start taking action today.. Write to your congressmen repeatedly about your opinions, vote, etc.. I digress, but i think you know what i mean.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 6 because of these few things: story wasn't bad, lines were stirring at best but mostly average, acting was decent by most and very well done by ms. portman. the action was not breathtaking but it did somewhat satisfy. lastly, the ending of this message-dependent movie did not instill a lasting message. This was quite disappointing because I was expecting a very philosophical ending and the best they could come up with was a half-fast attempt at trying to summarize what the message was.

","I think I've seen this movie about 7 times; and each time, it continues to get better and better. Some would say this is a parable about the Bush administration, but you have to realize that the comic and the screenplay were written well before the year 2000, so there's little chance that it's a direct attack on American politics. It is more of a movie that shows that a revolution can still happen in today's countries, even in established governments who suppress their people. As V himself said, ""People shouldn't be afraid of their governments, but rather governments should be afraid of their people"".<br/><br/>All politics out of the way, the movie itself is absolutely superb. The casting itself is a masterpiece; each actor was in his/her right place. John Hurt was a fitting dictator, spouting his angry drivel from a massive TV screen (made it all the more fun to see him crying in the end, a true coward dictator, even his name 'sutler', is supposed to mimic 'hitler'). V himself was acted by a very capable Hugo Weaving, and did very well for someone who spent his whole movie behind a mask. Natalie Portman played the innocent 'Mercedes' character (there are many parallels between this movie and the novel, the Count of Monte Cristo).<br/><br/>Even though this is an action/thriller movie, it makes the audience think, and it doesn't try to explain itself too much, or else it would be a 4 hour movie. Much of the movie is left up to the audience's imagination, such as the virus that is used at Larkhill, V's identity, or what will happen to Britain after V succeeds in blowing up Parliment. Movies like this hope that the audience has half the brain to reason through parts on their own, and it's nice to watch a movie that gives you something to think about even after it's over.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend that everyone see this movie, so that you can form your own opinion on it, and it will most likely be a good one at that. The movie isn't as political as everyone makes it seem, and can be applied to any administration or regime. The movie calls V a terrorist, but a more correct term would be a revolutionary, since his intentions aren't to terrorize, but to get revenge on those who made him as he is, and to awaken the people out of their fear. I guess that makes him the exact opposite of a terrorist.<br/><br/>*********/10 (Minus one star for overuse of the word ""bollocks"")"

","Was I supposed to be in love with the graphic novel before I went, then be thrilled about how well it adhered to it? (I have not read the graphic novel). I have no idea whether that's what has people so in love with this movie, but there has to be some explanation other than the movie itself.<br/><br/>I'm not saying that it was pathetic--it was a good movie, just seems to me to be way overrated. The storyline is basically something out of the Michael Moore version of reality, which I found somewhat tiresome and hackneyed. Much of the opening dialog that introduces us to V was hard to understand, and I thought the transition of V from stilted, overly formal performer to human was awkward.<br/><br/>In general the work with the mask was interesting and the action and special effects were good. The acting was all very well done. Basically, it's a solid seven--the execution rescues it from what would otherwise be a boring, overplayed theme of conspiracy theories about current governments."
"siderite","8","0","2","10 June 2006"," Great movie, a must see, too bad it was a Wackowski ending
","I started watching this movie thinking it's another Ultraviolet/Aeon Flux/Catwoman clone. The only thing that made me watch it was Hugo Weaving in the cast. I was blown away.<br/><br/>Let's start from the beginning. This is a movie about political extremism, about fear and the lack of it, about how easy people can be forced into submission and, of course, how they should force themselves out of. You can easily compare the movie with Matrix, this one being not a protest against everyday life, but one against live as it becomes slowly but surely.<br/><br/>OK, there's this guy, a true terrorist, killing people and blowing things up for a cause. Fortunately for this movie, it is a literate one and very well interpreted by Hugo Weaving. His purpose is to overthrow the oppressive government that rules the UK much like Hitler ruled Germany. It is ironic that the dictator is interpreted by John Hurt, this being the mother of all political full circles. He is helped by the first reluctant Natalie Portman. Stephen Rea has the role of the good cop trying to uncover the story beneath it all, much like in Citizen X.<br/><br/>Overall there are good ideas in the movie, a true plot, as opposed to the dreadful idiocies that I mentioned at the beginning, good acting and, of course, a happy ending. Who can really defeat Smith?<br/><br/>The only bad thing about this movie is the theatrics. I'm OK with the visuals, since the movie is based on a graphic novel (that's what they call comics in the UK, apparently), but I really despise knife jugglery before throwing the damn thing and over talking. It is hard to connect with the main character, since he is acting like a classic villain: Black mantle, mask, talking all the time with a British/Aussie accent. Anyway, like in Matrix, the ending is grandiose, with fireworks and the whole Brisith parliament building exploding from a single subway wagon full of explosives. But then again, the word parliament comes from French and it means the place of talks. And I really didn't like the talking too much. Hmmm :)"

"jdkraus","10","0","2","27 May 2006"," A Great combination of action and story!
","I watched this film with an open-mind, having no idea what to expect. After the two hours passed by, I experienced true entertainment, and a sense of truth and awe.<br/><br/>The film depicts the graphic comic book about the vigilante who goes by the name of V. It takes place in the near future, with England and other nations under a Nazi like, dictatorship that rules over everything. It is led by the Chancellor. This ideal form of government is supposed to suppress all forms of terrorism and make everything peaceful.<br/><br/>But V sees things in a different light and has a plan of his own. People may criticize and compare the character V as Darth Vader for he wears all black, has similar political views of Michael Moore, and wears a top hat with a Guy Fox mask. I strong disagree with this comparison or even criticism, for V is character of his own (perhaps not too many reviewers have read or known about the comic book) and he is portrayed very wonderfully by Hugo Weaving. <br/><br/>Even more criticism is aimed at the political views in the film. For instance the Chancellor, played by John Hurt, portrays a pure image of Adolf Hitler (even though he was no more than a shouting figurehead). To a degree I agree with this criticism, but there is no intention of propaganda in this film. there maybe controversy, but it is not out to bash the Leftists. <br/><br/>Now after saying that, the story goes on with V meeting a woman named Evy (Natalie Portman) who seeks the truth one night as she's mugged. He rescues her, and the two develop a relationship that revolves around the corruption of the government and what life was once like before it fell into the Fascist like dictatorship. To formulate his scheme, he needs her help, in which leads to a tale of darkness, destruction, misery, and well needed peace and freedom to save the world. <br/><br/>This movie was extremely well done from the dark and grim cinematography that explores the tone of the story (R.I.P. Adrian Biddle), to the fabulous set-decoration and script, and the awesome fight sequences developed by the help of the Wachowski brothers. The film tells and questions country's government's of their true intentions which makes this film all the more controversial. However, the two hour film dragged a little, making me feel a bit uncomfortable in my seat in the theater. There's also much mature content including some disturbing images in the film that needs shielding from youthful eyes. It deserved a solid R rating. <br/><br/>It's a great film that has excellent action as well as storyline/controversy. Overall ***1/2 out of ****"

","I saw The Matrix very young (or younger than I am now) and didn't get it AT ALL. So I hated it. Then I had the strange urge to watch it again. And I did so, and with that second viewing I finally got it. And I continued to watch it until it became one of my favorite movies in the whole of cinema. So what, oh what, will the Wachowski's follow up The Matrix?...<br/><br/>Writing:10/10<br/><br/>Why, with V For Vendetta! I hadn't read the comic, so as soon as I heard of Vendetta I rushed out to my local bookstore where it was freshly reprinted in order for the release of the movie. And it completely changed my views on comics! I have always given comics a bad rep for being unable to tell a full-filling story. I always found them fragmented, and sadly hard to find emotion in. The mighty Alan Moore(writer of the equally fantastic Watchmen comic) wrote a VERY full-filling story. And the Wachowski's added on to that story, and turned it into a film. The comic still had some rough edges that simply come with the medium, and the genius duo filed them down.<br/><br/>Direction:10/10<br/><br/>I was timid about James McTiegue taking the reins and not Larry and Andy, but he proved me wrong, with a vengeance. He adds luscious camera work, visuals, and matches all the greatness set down before him by the script.<br/><br/>Acting:10/10<br/><br/>There are some roles actors are simply born to play. A role nobody else should ever handle. V is that role. Hugo Weaving is simply a revelation as the title character, and his performance is really rather hard to describe. Natalie Portman does a great job (I rather fancy her), and her character is beautifully tortured with these moral decisions. Stephen Rea is also amazing. I was confused as to who thought Stephen Rea was good for the role, as the character in the comic and the actor simply didn't match. But he came right out of left field with the strongest supporting performance I have probably seen in a comic book film.<br/><br/>Score: 10/10<br/><br/>The film does not have quite as much music as I thought it would, remaining suspiciously quiet throughout. But when it begins, it never lets up. The score starts and it...is...POWERFUL. <br/><br/>Visuals:10/10<br/><br/>Very few VFX shots are in this film, but when they are there they are fantastic and not one shot I found poorly done. I especially enjoy the ""knife-time"" fight at the end. <br/><br/>The film is stunning, and the V character makes the movie worth it over and over again. But wait...V isn't a character or a man. He was an idea. And ideas are bullet-proof."

","Loved this movie. I RARELY go to a theater anymore but I made an exception for V. The characters were well defined and, wonder of wonders, one could actually identify with them. So easy to do when real humanity is portrayed instead of the abstractions that dominate too many movies. And to hear on the screen a vocabulary such as V's without any of it being watered down for the masses, well, I could hardly contain my joy. My teenage sons (of a generation cursed with video games) really liked the movie and were able to follow the plot. I was pleased.<br/><br/>My only gripe is that the use of homosexuality as the prime examples of persecuted freedom represented a complete loss of the sense of proportion that the film had in other respects. In a world such as that represented in V for Vendetta homosexuality would NOT be the primary target. This was the equivalent of listening to a tape and finding several crucial parts erased by some previous cavalier listener. That said, the main import of the film and the characterizations chosen to carry it were quite refreshing in comparison to the usual sex and violence visual cauterizations of frontal lobes everywhere."

Cinematografically it met my expectations, but plot wise,the way the story was told, it was an utter disappointment. I can effectively describe the movie in one sentence: ""Heavily threaded with clichÃ©s"". The so-called philosophical sentences, the ""emotionally charged scenes"" that were so exaggerated that it produced a state of nausea, especially when the same lame scene was used more than once at different times to give an extra emotional/flashback effect, the superficial feel of the reactions of the characters to certain events...Don't get me wrong, the story was great, it's worth going to just for the sake of the story and some really great scenes. What gets to me is that the story was so good they didn't need to revert to cheap tricks just to produce a ""mood"", those guys could have done a much better job with that movie and while I was watching I just felt that a really high potential had just been wasted and as a movie lover, especially for one who has a passion for Utopian, mixed genres like this one, it saddened me deeply.."

And here's the point : seriously, what did you expect from the W. brothers? A popcorn-movie, no more no less, with some good lines, spectacular actions, nice photography and so on...Don't you tell me you went to see matrix to get your life changed, or I'm sorry to have to tell you you're a nerd! You just have to see the number of copies to realize it won't be nor revolutionary nor risky, as this is big money, and big money's granted by bankers if you're polite and able to get it back....This is NOT politics but entertainment! That's all folks! (for those who actually think it's dangerous for the sake of society to entertain with such subjects, well, too bad for you URSS and South Africa are no more...). Well you can argue that it's a bit like a real-time revolution on MTV (yeah revolt is cool yeah dude,yeah, is there some coke in the fridge?), but I see it more like entertainment has to deal with what frightens people ; and as you see what happens in the world nowadays, you can easily understand that people do want to be entertained with a happy-ending revolution. And yes, the movie isn't as good as the comics is, as the comics IS a jewel, but this is the name of the game : read it again or read it, but you can enjoy the movie just by remembering what's around : it's way better than any I'm or blockbuster yet playing. I'm just saying you cannot compare a movie involving so much people and money with an author's work on any book.(even if being published also is like swimming with sharks, but the sharks are a bit less hungry...) Face reality : cinema may have been a 7th art, but now its bowels are stuck in the bankers' hands... So, as far as entertainment is concerned, V is a good popcorn-movie, worth the ticket...As for the rest, well once you're out, you still have plenty of time to read books. Oh, and Natalie Portman...oh my...She's great!(Looks like the Ripley capillary syndrome's back...Nothing like shaving to start again and forget star wars) Special mention to Hugo Weaving, as he does a great job being emotional with a mask on! This guy is really good at making simple characters quite unique.<br/><br/>Special mention (2) to all the casting, as many of the background characters really fit.The bad ones really look like they've to, and Stephen Rea's perfect as the not-so-sure-to-be-bad inspector. Thus, plus the fact that FX are cool, soundtrack is OK, and it has everything you want to spend two hours. So if you don't feel like watching another Takashi Miike tonight and if you just want a good popcorn-movie so you can sleep well after, then go for V! You won't regret!"

","A movie that truly makes you think about the current socio-political scenario. The dramatic metaphors make for a superb mix, especially the part where they show the dominoes falling. Acting is not much of a concern here, as all eyes are on V, the enigmatic, flamboyant masked figure who is the protagonist of the story. Kudos to the Wachowski brothers for having taken the gamble to make a movie where the protagonist is a masked vigilante who cares less about upholding the law and self-righteously refraining from killing the villains. V is a hero who is not a hero. Not your typical wisecracking, gunslinging, beat-up-a-thousand-bad-guys-without-a-single-scratch good guy. The Wachowski brothers started a trend with The Matrix and their passion for storytelling is now fully realized in this brilliant movie. A must-watch for everyone."

","I go to the movies maybe once a year, generally to see something like Micheael Moore's newest film. But I've seen this thing three times already. A good friend who writes comic books for DC pushed the ten-issue series of this story on me several years ago - I'd never read a comic (oops - they're called graphic novels now) and actually gasped for breath several times after turning a page. There is real power in this thing. I'm sorry the author (Alan Moore - a truly brilliant and inventive man) was not given the control he had hoped for - he even took his name off the credits. But I believe most of his vision and political understanding was maintained. Natalie Portman is nothing short of brilliant- and is a very different sort of actress - a true anti-celebrity. In a radio interview on NPR, she asked not be insulted by being called a ""movie star"" - She absolutely refuses to take part in the star bullshit- won't go anywhere near the scene, though her acting skills and remarkable, strong quiet beauty would most certainly put her near the top rung of that ladder quickly. She is also very very serious about the meaning and importance of this particular movie. John Stewart had her on the Daily Show and suggested that right wing and mainstream critics would savage the film (they did) and she said ""I certainly hope so.

"newfiesailor","8","0","1","15 May 2006"," Smart comic book adaptation
","V for Vendetta aims high to deliver a comic book adaptation with a soul and some depth. Although not a great movie, it has flashes of brilliance. It foreshadows if the Wachowski brother's are ever firing on all cylinders, they could deliver a movie of a decade. It's the Blood Simple of their credits.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving portrays ""V"" as the heroic anti-hero, a man whose anger at being terribly wronged motivates him to declare war on the shadowy government figures responsible. One understands his inclinations, especially when his past is revealed. Weaving is the masterpiece of this film, playing a tormented loner with an agenda. The subtle nuances occurring in this film are designed to make you think, and Weaving delves in with this complex character. Poetry spouting, knives flashing, a man of bravado, yet still revealing a human side with despair and loneliness evident in his scenes with Evie. One of the best comic book characters to date.<br/><br/>The other two main characters I found weakened the film. Natalie Portman is weak as V's feminine companion, her accent both poor and distracting. There are a lot of young British actresses who were far more suited to this role, but I anticipate she was given this role due to her Star War's fame. The appeal of those films are probably targeted towards the same audience. Steven Rea, with his basset hound eyes and wore down look, just seems out of place as the detective on V's trail. Rea is a masterful actor (watch his as portrayal as the detective on the hunt for ""The Rostov Ripper"" in Citizen X) but his talents are wasted in this role. An edgier, younger actor would have breathed more life as V's foil.<br/><br/>The film teeters between comic book action style, but is delivering subject matter that is both dark and heavy handed. It left me befuddled where the direction was leading the audience. Confusing but somehow, engaging.<br/><br/>I would have loved to learn more of V's past for he is an entirely intriguing character.<br/><br/>This film is a bit of a crazy mess, but it is a lovely crazy mess. For something entirely different from the usual, unoriginal Hollywood crap being churned out, check out this movie. It aims to be smart and succeeds."

","First, I must say that after seeing a film of this kind, I really feel sad, because of the people out there who don't speak, or can't understand English language. (as a Hungarian, it's not my native language too, but I hope I can express myself accordingly :-)) Listening to Hugo Weaving's incredible monologues, while he's dubbed, it's just a waste. Thank God, I've seen this movie subtitled! Hopefully, there will be a subtitled version of it on the DVD, which I'll no doubt buy.<br/><br/>The acting is (of course) perfect. As for Natalie Portman, I'd like to append that I've always known she's a great actress (even when she played Mrs. Skywalker), she just needed a good story to express her talent (which she got this time). I'd rather not go into further details here, as the other comments on IMDb describe the technical,performance and entertaining side of the movie pretty nicely.<br/><br/>My point with this comment is, that for a long time now I've been thinking about politics. I read/saw/heard the news from all around the world, and slowly an image started to fade in. I was questioning if we are on the right path (we, as in humanity). I discussed my theories, beliefs and point of views with my friends, and a few of them actually did agree with me. But that was it. Most of the people (not just my friends) haven't even thinking about these things. They live their ""normal"" lives, and don't care if ""Mr. X"" at the other side of the world throws bombs on innocent people. And why? Well, if your country piled up a huge amount of military hardware (which accidentally run and built by multinational corporations, which represents the basic foundation of the country's economy), wouldn't you want to educe that military power to please your most plentiful resources? Well, that really is an exaggerated point of view, I know. Still, the problem exists. And that's why I was so glad when first Syriana, then V for Vendetta came up. Both of these movies(alright, Syriana is bit different) opens up the eyes of the people, shows them that their fear, created by their own government, made them to forget something, that -as ""V"" says- shall never ever be forgot. However ""V"" does this a more entertaining way :-)<br/><br/>Of course, the situation is not that bad, yet. I'm just happy that I'm not alone with my queries, and someone who has the talent, actually did tell this possible future to the crowd in a more entertaining way than anybody ever could."

","At first since this was like a British-type of flick, or takes place entirely in the UK, you know what I mean, I was expecting cheesy British humor, slow acting, that kinda thing. I was completely wrong. Very action-packed, good acting, and it really hits home with world-issues like governments that control people when people should control governments. But, point being, really a good flick about a rebellious man who takes on his government who wants to rule the citizens. Good stuff, good stuff indeed. This is a flick I would recommend before it hit the rental stores. So, my summary - lots of action, good storyline indeed, and some love thrown into the mix as well. But that's just me."

","This was the greatest movie ever made. I'm serious. I've seen past movies like The Weather Man, Casanova, The Family Stone, and this is my favorite movie of all time.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman never disappoints me. She was excellent for the role of Evey Hammond. Her rank in Closer should have won the Academy Award in Best Supporting Actress in a Drama. If you haven't seen this movie yet I will give you a brief summary of multi million dollar hit V for Vendetta.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is about principles. Meanings of Actions and Causes. Remember, Remember the fifth of November. After being saved from a gang bang rape, Evey Hammond (Portman) meets the heroic but diabolical mastermind V (Hugo Weaving)and is confused of his character. V is using terrorist tactics to get vendetta on the government of Britain. After a minute or two after the meet V shows Evey the blowing of the Parliament and she begins to be tracked down by the police for cases of unsolved 3rd degree murder. V rescues her again and takes her to his hideout where she has to live for a year until his tasks are complete. <br/><br/>Evey eventually gets caught by the police and taken to a facility where she gets interrogated to expose V's identity or his whereabouts. She refuses and gets tortured continuously until the interrogator asks her for the last time where V is. She refuses and they let her cell door open. She realizes the path of the facility hallway leads to V's hideout. He was the one who tested her loyalty and friendship.<br/><br/>V eventually kills all of the foes of the government then at the end kills Creedy the sellout. He dies by Evey's side and realizes that she was the one who made him go on and believe that he could do all of those things he did. He finials finish his death wish to blow up the parliament and Evey pulls the lever with the subway of dynamite and bombs and realize that V wasn't just V he was her father, her mother, her brother, he was all of us."

","This is an exceptional piece of film in several ways; be it from an acting standpoint (Hugo Weaving evokes true emotional subtlety and complexity without the aid of facial expressions--fantastic!), a musical standpoint (1812 Overture), or just good ol' excellent storytelling. However, the most enduring aspect of this film is the thought process it invokes. On it's surface, it seems to be a simple ""boo big government!"" film. However, you dig a little deeper, and you see that it's a warning piece that, though the source material could not have anticipated it, speaks out quite neatly against things like the Patriot Act; things that rob us of liberty for the sake of security, leaving us deserving neither (paraphrasing Ben Franklin there -- it's an old idea). And then, on yet another level, it is a film about the revolutionary spirit, differing perspectives on ""terrorism,"" etc....essentially, highlighting as many shades of gray as can be found in such an issue. To summarize the summary, if you like your films full of intellectual exposition and aren't too worried about ""genrefication,"" this is right up your alley.

"LuckyGraveyardBoots","7","0","1","9 May 2006"," Vis-a-Vis V for Vendetta
","Americans always seem to need something in times of crisis, and a lot of the time we turn to movies to provide whatever may be lacking in our lives. Often a form of escapism, with Hollywood releases in recent years (War of the Worlds and Cinderella Man, to name a few examples, along with many other superhero movies including the upcoming Superman) film provides what we are missing in this country: a distinct hero. Somebody unquestionably righteous, around whom we can all rally without second-guessing ourselves. The last time political circumstances were so befuddling, in the post-Vietnam era in the mid-to-late seventies, a revolution in cinema was underway and directors responded to audiences needs with the sympathetic anti-hero (for example, Travis Bickle of Taxi Driver, or Colonel Kurtz of Apocalypse Now)an unsatisfactory and perplexing symbol of the general mindset during a time when everything was being questioned. Now, V for Vendetta seems like just what America needs. Revolving around the story of Evie, an outwardly normal girl in a futuristic London who is drawn into the rebel underground and her relationship with a mysterious rebel who identifies himself as V, it brings up a lot of coherent debatessuch as, what exactly is a terrorist? Is a terrorist always evilor is it a matter of opinion? By tying in V's mission to rouse the populace against a tyrannical system dominated by the religious right with the Guy Fawkes story (normally considered unsavory on all parts, Fawkes' motives are reconsidered), and by making the terrorist very sympathetic, in fact, and by stirring our pity for him, the poor mainstream viewers who just wanted to ogle Natalie Portman are thrust into the uncomfortable role of rooting for the terrorist. These days, anyone with a penchant for blowing up government buildings is regarded with something akin to suspicion, and I certainly applaud the Wachowski brothers for being able to pull it off. It's interesting to speculate on audiences reactionbut one thing is certainnobody will walk out of this movie without having contemplated some of the issues presented. V, however, in my opinion, is not an actual terrorist, but a rebel with a cause. Terrorists, like those who caused 9/11, only want to instill terror into the populaceof a nation or a government they despise: sometimes their own, in the case of the Unabomberin order to make a point. V, rather than sadistically tormenting the people, makes them his allies against the oppressive system. All in all, it's rather puzzling, but by the end we certainly feel that V was in the right. By giving us a hero qua semi-unstable megalomaniac who always remains a bit of an enigma (he never removes his Guy Fawkes mask), the film wavers throughout between giving us a hero and giving us an anti-hero. Maybe it's saying it's time to reconsider our previous beliefs and political affiliations, or maybe not. Maybe we should regain our country from the grip of Christian conservatives. Maybe we should blow up the Pentagon(?). You can never be quite sure. One thing is for certainlove prevails in all the twists and turns of the storyit's not, I can state with relief, simply a boring dissection of political issues. All in all, V for Vendetta was not a great film in and of itself. Although Hugo Weaving in the part of V did a commendable job acting throughout, given that you can never see his, none of the performances were particularly moving, and far from life-changingyou felt like they were characters in a movie, which is what they were. It had some memorable lines and astounding camera-work, but didn't provide too many original insights on its characters, or the human spirit, or life in general, nor should it: that's not the point. It's not legendary; it will, however, be remembered for the socio-political questions it raises, and the message it attempts to send out to its audience: ""People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."""

","V for Vendetta is the first film in 2006 that i will fondly remember by 2007. It is a thought-provoking and action packed vision of a totalitarian future Britain, but it could easily be any other country. The story is different and exciting, the action is violent and not watered down like most action flicks of late, and the performances by the excellent cast is great. Hugo Weaving takes the cake, even though he is behind a mask the whole time, with his cool voice and ass-kickery, and Natalie Portman is amazing. She is one of the best actresses in the world today, and she proves it by being tough and beautiful (even after having her head shaved) and hitting all the right emotional notes right on target. The last 30 minutes of the film is one of the most exhilarating scenes i've ever seen in a movie theater. At the movie's climax i was nearly standing.

I presume this is the novel which contains what the movie misses and what is necessary to make it worthy of watching - an absorbing glue of story. Without it the movie is falling apart to its non-existent matter, empty meaning, paltry visual effects, tasteless soundtrack and overly bombastic acting. It is not convincing in any way. Is this supposed to be a persuasive storyline? Take a 17th century way of solving government issues into nearest future and play a game everybody supposed to believe in? Having pompous behavior of characters as a way to ensure that? Not smart. Is this the way to depict a totalitarian future? With a couple of TV shows and a really big chancellor face on conference screen? Ridiculous. It might as well be a way to save on budget. See 1984 for example of totalitarianism. Is this a way to entertain the public? Showing historical buildings of London being demolished to a tune of 1812 overture? Well, i must admit, it wasn't that bad from rhythm standpoint, but it's still not more than vulgar. See Night Watch for example of a city demolishing. Not smart, not entertaining, not thrilling. Still, having a couple of episodes which raise arduous moral questions, actually not even incidental to main story. Pity. But why I'm so indignant? There are lots of worse movies and better ones, and I'm not a fan, again, I didn't read the novel. Because its Wachowsky brothers who did the screenplay and James McTeigue who was assistant director on Matrix.

The movie could not convince me as a spectator about proposed premises. No room for emotional catharsis or something unexpected. No discussion was open about the roots of the presented problems, reducing its solutions to an ingenuous and previsible symbolism that just add another level of alienation and passivity to the potential agents of change.

"tomimt","7","0","1","24 April 2006"," Good, yet simplified, political action drama.
","Let's put the good news here in up front: 'V for Vendetta' is the best movie made from Alan Moore's graphical novels. Though that wasn't hard task in such, as 'From Hell', even though had some pretty scenes, was a grave disappointment and 'The League Of Extraordinay Gentlemen' was just terrible.<br/><br/>'V For Vendetta', directed by James McTigue and written by the Wachowski brothers of the Matrix fame is a dumbed down and heavily trimmed version of the graphical novel of same name. Roughly put, almost half of the characters have been eliminated and even the main characters have been some what altered. In example Evey (Natalie Portman) was an under aged prostitute, or at least a wannabe as she actually never got that far, and V (Hugo Weaving) himself was more of a cold hearted psychotic lover of anarchy. In the film he's a bit more likable in his insanity.<br/><br/>The plot is nearly same with the novel, but as said trimmed down. Several side plots have been entirely eliminated because of reduced character count. Some things have been added in, like the budding romance between V and Evey. The importance of police captain Finch (Stephen Rhea) has been increased, but some of the most interesting aspects of his story, like the real reason of his understatement of V, have been cut out. Also the story of V is told so, that some viewers might get the idea, that V gained some kind of pyrotechnic powers from Larkhill. This wasn't the case. No superpowers in this film, unless you count V's speed and stamina.<br/><br/>It's very easy to see who against some of the political messages are aimed in the film, that's why it's interesting to see how well this movie will last the test of time, as it is rather on the nerve of political on goings. 'V for Vendetta' isn't a bad movie, far from it, it's just too simplified from its origins in the form that it's presented. Also note, that it's not an action film, though it has some pretty neat action- and special-effects scenes in it.<br/><br/>Acting is all together very good and effects and the whole totalitarian society of England is very nicely portrayed. John Hurt as Sutler, the great dictator, is doing very good job as a man, who has eyes everywhere. <br/><br/>The film flows easily and I was entertained for the duration of the movie. It was much better than I expect it to be, but I fully understand why Moore thought, that script wasn't very strong."

","I thought the movie was good. It might have seemed better had I read the novel first, but I don't really read novels. At any rate, it kept me in suspense: the twists and turns really kept me on the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>The only caveat about the movie I would say was that is was a bit too gory for my taste. I think some of the point of killing and murder and mayhem does not need to have explicit blood and gore to get the point across, but sometimes the directors or writers have a certain mood or edginess they like to invoke in a movie. So that may be the case here. <br/><br/>I definitely liked the good vs evil story line in ""V"". There is a humanness about the characters and I like that in a movie. <br/><br/>Not sure if everyone will like this type of movie. I kinda thought it was like another of the comic book characters come to life, and most comic book characters have special powers and a dark side. It was kinda like that."

","I had high expectations for this film when I shelled $8 at the theaters. End result; they were exceeded greatly. The film has great underlying messages in it, most notably tolerance and understanding. The acting by Portman (who still remains attractive when bald), Hugo Weaving and John Hurt are some of the more memorable performances of this year. The Wachowski Brothers have taken great care to follow the graphic novel and modernizing it to the 21st century. Yet, I leaves me to wonder if the film would have a greater or lesser impact if were made in 2003-2004. The similarities between the government and the one depicted in the film are staggering; There is extreme prejudice against homosexuals and the leader of the government is an conservative Christian with a lust for power. (Please keep in mind that every Christian is not a Republican and many have compassion, tolerance and understanding like myself) This film can be used as a benchmark to open the hearts and minds of many.

","V is a great film - it's got a good storyline, an honorable villain out for revenge against those who wronged him (and, in the process, bring down the Totalarian regime ruling England), and the gorgeous Natalie Portman. While it's hard to argue the Wachowski Bros. do a good job portraying the future in the aftermath of the past we're in the process of creating (What?), it just seems to me they go out of their way to tie almost all the ills of the ""Big Brother"" controlled future to the U.S.'s current myopic administration. But as I opened with, they do a good job presenting that scenario. They refer to the wars of the ""Former United States"" in the early part of the 20th century, almost calling those wars the cause for our downfall. But what really did us in was our lack of preparedness for Bird Flu (or pick-a-flu), and the controllers of the state of Britain have gone a great length to remind the citizenry of that everyday - drilling fear into their heads constantly. (Sound familiar?) The movie is black, foreboding (depressing, actually), but it tells a story that compels the viewer to argue we're not headed in that direction (at least, if you don't like Bush it's easy to see that). That being said - and I can't put my finger on it - there was something missing. Yeah, we could've seen ""The Man Behind the Mask,"" as it was very hard to connect w/ V. (Also, the first chance we hear the hero speak, it's nothing, NOTHING, but words beginning with the letter V. OK, we get it, you can write a good scene, CONGRATULATIONS!) But despite the fact we see the root cause of his terrorism, I didn't connect w/ him because I kept wondering what this guy behind the mask looked like. Alright, enough of that - the action was good - it was definitely from the Wachowskis, but it wasn't ""Groundbreaking"" like the Matrix (and I mean that in a good way). The action contributed to the film without making itself the centerpiece of the film. All in all a great flick and - I'm sorry, I have to - any chance, ANY CHANCE AT ALL, to see Natalie Portman is alright with me - she is just plain FINE!

","V for Vendetta is a nice movie, and in my opinion better than the Matrix (or at least part 2 and 3 of that trilogy). It excels in delivering astonishing visuals and a different approach to the politically engaged movie making. The drawbacks, however, reminded me a lot of the Matrix trilogy. First of all, there is this enormous amount of intellectual blah. Intelligent movies convince the viewer of their wisdom by not constantly trying too hard to be that clever picture. This is not the case with V for Vendetta, and what is left is a lot of pretentious gibberish that may lead some viewers to believe that they are clever for understanding this movie, but nothing more than that. Secondly, human interaction and behaviour is not at all present. When I think about the characters of V for Vendetta, I think of nicely drawn comic characters. I know the story is based on a comic, but moving images require a whole other type of dialogue than still drawings. Also, I had problems with the masked protagonist and the bigger-than-life voice that supports it. Natalie Portman wasn't too convincing either with whatever accent it was she was trying to utter. Finally, comic-to-movie translations work as well as novel-to-movie translations, which means they don't work at all, except for those few exceptions of brilliance. V for Vendetta isn't one, but worth a watch in the end for its original value."
"Royalcourtier","Null","0","2","13 April 2006"," Confusion about Church and State
","One reviewer referred to a ""fascist government where separation of church and state no longer exist"". Unfortunately that is completely incorrect. There is an established church in Britain. The idea that Chruch and State should be separate, or are separate, is a peculiarly American concept. It arose because of the intolerance shown by Established churches in the early American colonies, many of which had established churches. In an attempt to prevent such abuses in future the constitution prohibited state churches. It didn't however ban religious expression, something which many people now fail to grasp. V is seemingly influenced by this confusion. What we must bear in mind is that V for Vendetta is really set in modern America. The ostensible UK setting is just a sham, just as in an earlier era Gilbert and Sullivan set their satirical operettas in foreign lands, and more recently Animal Farm attacked the Soviet Union in the guise of a farm. V is as much an attack on Bushite America as anything Michael Moore could produce- it just isn't so obvious."

","So this movie was crazy. I had no idea what it really was about. I thought it would just be a revenge type movie filled with lots of rage and...well...vendettas. Instead, it a more deeper meaning. A meaning of justice and freedom. I got a chance to really understand that and embrace the world we live in. I felt lucky that I haven't been oppressed and murdered for my difference in religion or beliefs.<br/><br/>I also loved how you didn't get to see V's face at all. It kept you, the audience, wondering who is this man? What does he really look like under that very Saw-esk mask? I felt in a way that I could relate to V. I mean, I didn't really agree with the fact that he was killing for justice but the fact that he did have compassion. I don't justify any killing, but it just fit the plot of the movie. <br/><br/>And to top it off, how awesome was it to see Big Ben blow up to millions of pieces...pretty sweet if you ask me!"

They completely missed the point with the relationship between Evey and V. The ending was awful, you were meant to finally see V, what happened there? There's absolutely no sense of time in this movie either, there was no way i knew it was a year later until they said it. American Cinema has struck again and pulled apart a great idea to make it watchable for one audience, Americans. Eggy in basket doesn't exist I'm afraid.

"thearctic_avenger","8","0","2","11 April 2006"," heavy handed but enjoyable
","If you enjoy watching a Guy Fawkes mask dipping in and out of heavy shadows and filling your vision, accompanied by the voice of Hugo Weaving reciting monologue, than V for Vendetta is probably for you. As it happens, it's just the sort of thing I was I the mood for when I saw it, so I had a great time. <br/><br/>The film begins with an explanation of the 5th of November, and then moves on to introducing our main Characters, V and Evey. The first thing that struck me about the opening 10-15 minutes was the incredible amount of uninterrupted dialog. Honestly, it was of Gilmore Girls proportions. It seemed that everything had to be explained or commented on by someone. This really set the tone for the rest of the film. I was impressed by the fact that there was not a single theme or idea in the film that wasn't explicitly, and at length, discussed in dialog. Like the prominence of the Fawkes mask, this is not necessarily a bad thing, but it did prevent the film from containing any subtlety at all. <br/><br/>And this was my overall impression of the film-it was heavy handed. The visuals were enjoyable to watch, but were grandiose- not unlike those of the latter two matrix films. The score tells the same story- rarely was there time for a quiet song or unobtrusive atmospheric stuff. All we really got was very loud very dramatic music, again, more than just a little reminiscent of the matrix trilogy score. If your wondering how true the film is to the graphic novel that inspired it, than this is probably the main difference. Where the comic created a claustrophobic, dingy environment juxtaposed with the dramatic character of V, the film creates what feels like an expansive and rich environment for an even more dramatic V. <br/><br/>Having said that, over the top drama and action, done well, can be fun. And it was. The actors expounded their mountains of lines enthusiastically and with conviction- no line seemed tired or hacked. And because they seemed interested in what they were doing it was a lot easier for me to be.<br/><br/>The action sequences were few, but were executed competently. And strangely enough came out looking more like a comic book than the original graphic novel did. A friend commented to me afterwards that one of the moves V performed was identical to that of a Character from the video game Soul Calibur. with the vapor trails behind the blades and all.<br/><br/>While the film was essentially spoon fed political and social ideas wrapped in an action movie, it was done well and fun to watch as a result."

","There are a lot of holes in this movies. But putting all that aside, it still does not make sense on an emotional level. The whole thing is leftwing wish fulfillment and justification for terrorism, at a very childish level. It feeds in the liberal fantasy that terrorism is fun and sexy. And that it only hurts the ""bad guys."" As a fantasy, the movie may not mean much. But given that some people equate the imaginary world in the movie with modern day US or GB, the movie is obviously misleading to those people.

","This movie was by far much greater than i was expecting it to be. While not an strictly an ""action"" film, the small action sequences that there are are amazing; V is voraciously versed in art and volumes of veritably classic literature, he is dashing, insane, and intelligent, an ideal and a goal carried by a man, who in turn carries the visage and vindication of another visionary, Guy Fawkes. Very cool ""A Clockwork Orange"" reference when he talks to Creedy while playing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. V knows that there is something wrong with the British government, as do many people, in this uncompromising view of the future. His endeavor to change the government through terrorist tactics gives people a view of another side of terrorism than most have been shown in the attacks on the Twin Towers and the trains in Madrid. V is everybody. V is Vendetta! Freedom! Forever!"
"agentmori","10","0","2","4 April 2006"," V for Victorious
","V for Victorious<br/><br/>The movie I watched yesterday with Ms. Pinky (G4 1030 PM), the title of which is quite obvious, deserves, well, a better title. Not that I find the current title stupid, but it is just that given how fantastic and wonderful and exciting (is it already over the top?) the movie was executed, it is rather a problem for people like me to think of the movie without having flashes of that cheesy crime novel M is for Murder (or H is for Homicide, R is for Revenge).<br/><br/>Anyway, if you haven't seen the movie, STOP RIGHT HERE!<br/><br/>In the words of Dante, abandon all hope ye who enter here (or something like that), because ladies and gentlemen, I am gonna tell everything I like love about this movie.<br/><br/>First, the action sequences, that are the fight scenes, are great. No matrix-like bending-over (though I think the knife-trails, like computer mouse-trails, are a bit too cartooney, but hey, it works) which really shuts down my entire nervous system each time I get to see one.<br/><br/>Second, the acting  the actors  are well chosen and excellent. Yes, it may be funny to look at that irritating mask for the first 15 minutes, but soon enough, you'll get over it, as soon as you get to know the character behind the action figure. The chancellor, which is the head of state, is just so scary and irritating as a leader. Let's say, if he was your friend and he sent you, like, an e-mail, it would look a lot like this: HOW ARE YOU!!!??? IT'S BEEN QUITE SOME TIME, HUH!!!!!! DO YOU WANT TO MEET UP SOMETIME!!!!!! CATCH UP!!!!!???? Then, there's also the other guy who speaks like this: sureletusmeetwhenareyoufreeiknowiknowtherearealotofthingstosay<br/><br/>Third, the message. The script is so relevant to our situation nowadays. No wonder this movie almost got banned, which really made me wonder why GMA and the CBCP haven't made any statements about the effects of this movie. Or perhaps, they were unaware? Well, they will be in about 24 hours because this movie, honestly, is disturbing. The hero is a terrorist. The heroine helps the terrorist. The head of state is bad. The other leaders are greedy and selfish and are treacherous. It teaches about theatrics in terrorism and how to effectively convey a message to an apathetic nation such as ours. The fight against discrimination over race or sexuality. The sexual controversy that grabs the Church by the balls. The atrocity of media control and distortion. There's also the mention of a crumbled America and similarities to Bush's anti-terrorism something. I wouldn't be surprised at all if the local rebels, say the Magdalo group, emerge in a few months from now on at ABS-CBN's gates wearing Andres Bonifacio paper mache masks over their faces.<br/><br/>Fourth, no sappy love stories. Yes, V (not the Mayor) fell in love with Natalie Portman's character, Evey, but it's just a love story. Not a sappy one. Why? First of all, he died! Hahaha! No happy endings in terms of romance, and sex, or whatever that could pass for a relationship between the two main characters of the movie. Best of all, V died, which also means.<br/><br/>Finally, no sequel! A prequel maybe, but at least no chances of sequel. This means the Wachowski Brothers and all their accomplices cannot and could never screw this movie at all in their lifetime the way they messed up Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus. That is, of course, if they don't resolve to genetics, or cloning, or spiritual apparitions.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other nice things about this movie (e.g. sounds, editing, narration), but I'm only sticking to 5 main points. I hope you realize why I'm sticking to fiVe. Strength through Unity, Unity through Faith: screams the posters. Heck, I'm 100% into it if ever I have to watch this movie all over again."
"hayoung","3","0","5","8 April 2006"," Anti-feminist issues in V for Vendetta
","My take on the movie is that it would have been excellent film with a good activist message -- that is if it wasn't so very anti-feminist.<br/><br/>In the first scene a female defiantly goes out after curfew in a society run by dictatorship. Strong move you may say; however, you would be wrong. The action (that she is taking in order to go out on some date with her boss, by the way) proves she is a stupid female because she has gone and gotten herself into a situation where she will be raped. Good thing there is a strong idealistic man around to save her. Puke.<br/><br/>Later she makes a strong move by defending the man who saved her with mace (but is then very, very easily knocked out by the other male attacker afterward - because, hey, she IS just a girl). First, defending him comes across as something she probably just thought she had to do to return the favor, and not something she would have done otherwise, because she wasn't strong enough. Then she basically says she doesn't know why she did it and regrets doing it, taking any initial strength in the action away.<br/><br/>We learn about her parents, both activists, both strong -- or are they? Her mother wanted to run away from the country because she didn't agree with it, but it is her father that insisted they stay and fight in order to make things right. Typical.<br/><br/>After 'her hero', hereafter referred to as the activist, saves her yet again while she is unconscious, she remains ungrateful for his help and decides that she will undermine his attempts at achieving his goals (damn her corrupting female influence) and defy him (while wearing a school-girl outfit and pigtails). She almost gets raped again in doing so, is saved by him for a third time (thank god for the leading man), and then runs away straight to another mans arms for safety (because clearly she can't do it on her own).<br/><br/>After that second man is imprisoned/killed/who knows, she is taken in and tortured. She defiantly refuses to give any information about the activist (and considering her actions earlier in attempts to get him caught, this defiance has everything to do with her being angry at the fact that they black bagged another person she is close to and nothing to do with having strong convictions). She finds a letter written by the only strong female character in the movie -- a lipstick lesbian with three gorgeous girlfriends that has the guys two seats over making suggestive comments. God forbid they show the average lesbian couple and destroy their dream that every girl that likes girls is gorgeous, that might make the male viewers mad! Good thing she found the letter to give her the strength to defy the guards one last time then her only choice is death, because you know it wasn't in her to begin with.<br/><br/>By now, however, the movie might be getting better on the whole feminist thing. It wasn't a man that gave her the strength to be defiant, it was that letter, written by a woman! WRONG AGAIN. The activist has stepped in, it was him doing her torturing and him who planted this letter (though the letter was at least real) because he has taken it upon himself to give this girl a sense of purpose and take away her fear. She didn't have to ask for it, he's a man, so clearly he knew what she needed. And does she get mad? No, she gets upset for a while, but returns to dance, fall in love and kiss this mad, grateful for his interference. She even says thank you.<br/><br/>Now we are moving toward the end of the film. He has fallen in love, and that love (for a woman) is enough to remove him from his pure path toward complete vengeance. Maybe we can consider that good in this case, since it means that he has a heart, but apply the same underlying logic and we get a world full of men unwilling to make concessions for love since it is always seen as a weakening of his resolve toward his original plans, caused by the corrupting female influence: never because she has a point, and always because he loves her/wants to sleep with her.<br/><br/>He dies for his cause, her corrupting influence not having been strong enough to keep him with her, but only for him to pass along the decision about whether or not to give the world a symbolic action. Don't worry guys, she is obedient and fulfills his wishes.<br/><br/>Any of these things taken on their own is not such a big deal, and in context they sometimes make sense. However, since the aspects have permeated every aspect of the film, I found it a little too much to take. It's not the specific decisions made by the characters that matter here, but the mentality behind the writers choosing those moves that is the problem. Most of you will shrug and think to yourself, I still found it entertaining, I still liked it, and that's what matters. Some might even label me for my opinions. But even if that's true, I thank you for giving me the time to read this through."

","Finally, a film about a comic book which is about more than just appealing visual aesthetics,this is a film with something to say. V for Vendetta features top-notch acting, solid characterisation and ideals which speak to, rather than down on, its audience.<br/><br/>Based on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, V for Vendetta tells the story of how meek and naive Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) flowers into a courageous revolutionary through the guidance of a costumed terrorist/freedom fighter named V (Hugo Weaving) who is determined to destroy an oppressive totalitarian government.<br/><br/>The film's message is preached by V in which people should cherish and guard their rights of freedom and individuality and not give it away to their governments.<br/><br/>The performances are brilliant, especially Hugo Weaving as V who conveys the essence and emotions of the character through expressive physical gestures and tone of voice and Natalie Portman easily gives her best performance to date. The supporting cast features British luminaries such as John Hurt, Timothy Pigott-Smith and Stephen Rhea. While the film contains a few minor aesthetic glitches (editing), it does contain thrilling action set pieces and stunning cinematography by the late Adrian Biddle perfectly captures the mood of the film. The domino montage sequence towards the end of the film is certainly one of the most memorable seen on film.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta was produced by the Larry and Wachowski and marked the directorial debut for James McTeigue who first worked as an assistant director on The Matrix. Joel Silver who produced Predator and the Die Hard films served as executive producer on this project.<br/><br/>Much has been made of Moore's insistence of the removal of his name from the credits, but this by far the best film adaptation of one of his works. I have read the graphic novel numerous times and can say the film stays true to its source material. V for Vendetta is a classic example of how watching a well-crafted film can be a thoroughly enjoyable experience."

","Based on the Alan Moore graphic novel, this is the tale of an apparently disfigured man made ""super human"" individual known only as V (Hugo Weaving for the most part) who is now trying to get England to rage against the machine so to speak, as England is now living in a cast iron authoritarian state under the Nazi like rule of the John Hurt villain. Natalie Portman plays the requisite eye candy.<br/><br/>True, the whole ""fight the power"" thing has been perverted over the years to being sort of a fashion statement, therefore this is ""rage against the machine"" made by the machine type product, whilst the very concept of rebelling against the evil dictator state has been done so many times that it's practically cliché, which is the film's real opponent much more than the Hurt character, but the film is still fun albeit weird. Weaving sounds like he's having a grand old time as V, playing him as a foppish trickster Zorro, and there's violence and style to spare, plus the 1812 Overture. Natalie Portman, however, was a little flat, and to be honest I'm not sure if she's just naturally flat, if she inherited some kind of Star Wars prequel syndrome or if she was just having trouble holding the British accent."
"timundanita","7","0","2","6 April 2006"," Nice film but needed a bit more thought
","I had not read the comic book before seeing the film and so came to it cold and unsure what to expect. All I knew about it was a few simplistic comments I heard on the radio. Let me say at the outset that I liked this film a lot. I loved the comic book style and was so grateful that it did not descend into gimmicky special effects. But I do have a few quibbles with it.<br/><br/>First of all I am very tired of films set in a London of Victorian terrace houses and alleyways that really does not exist anymore. At least it was not shot in those same few streets near Borough Market, but why did we not see the ugly and uncomfortable city full of Norman Foster 50's style constructions that London has become? I think it would be more interesting to try and set a Gothic tale in the shiny modern horror that is present day docklands for example. The new fascism is, after all, one of shiny glass and concrete where it can be hard to tell the difference between apartment blocks, office blocks, shopping malls, factories and multiplex cinemas.<br/><br/>Next quibble is, given the references to things like ""rendition"", I kept wondering when there would be a reference to Operation Cyclone, the US and UK campaign to destabilize central Asia that created the Taliban and Bin Laden. There do seem to be a lot of people who think the ""war on terror"" is something created by Bush and Blair and it would have made the film a lot stronger if it had demonstrated that it has been a policy goal of successive governments, both conservative and labour, democrat and republican, for the last thirty odd years at least. The UK is really a single party, totalitarian state. All the political parties are adherents of 19th century liberal imperialism as still taught by the British public schools. But the single party state shown in the film, at least I assume it was a single party state as there was no mention of a parliamentary opposition, hides this massive flaw in the system. The point being that if it makes no difference who you vote for destroying the institution might be a good idea but if you had a real alternative to vote for then destroying the institution might be quite a bad idea. Not referring to the foreign policy of the US and UK over the last 30 odd years seemed a bit of a cop out. The film wanted to tell us that the news we are fed is a fiction. Should it not therefore have made an attempt to tell us the truth that the media tries to hide? I also found it hard to believe that the British army would not open fire on civilians. History suggests otherwise - Lucknow, Bloody Sunday and Iraq to name just three instances. Perhaps English civilians are in a different category to Indians, Irish and Iraquis but I doubt it and anyway this was never said.<br/><br/>My main problem though was that I found it very difficult to sympathize with a character whose entire family have been murdered by the state and yet still goes to work for the state's propaganda machine. When Evey is in her cell I did rather feel it served her right. OK, it's obviously true that there are a lot of people who would happily sell their grannies to advance their media careers but I don't think this was what Evey's character was supposed to be. I think she was supposed to be someone who passively accepts the status quo and is politically unaware and during the course of the tale begins to see the truth that is not so much hidden as simply ignored because so little time is left to think about such things. People in Britain now work longer than anyone else and the retirement age is set to rise and rise but only perhaps 25 years ago a 20 hour working week was thought to probably be possible. This is a way of controlling people. Keep them struggling to pay the mortgage and they won't have time to protest anything. Surely though if one's entire family has been murdered by the state one would stop and think about what was going on.<br/><br/>It is of course encouraging to see a film that urges people to go out on the streets and protest at what our government has become but unless you understand fully what you are protesting against it might not be that constructive. Especially if there is no suggestion of what to replace that government with. I thought using Street Fighting Man over the end credits was a nice touch and it reminded me that Kieth Richards once said, if you are going to kick the world in the teeth you might as well use both feet. This film only used one foot, albeit to good effect. So it was a great film but ""If...."" made the same point rather better. I still rent ""If..."" on DVD from time to time. I wonder whether I will ever rent ""V for Vendetta"". Probably."

He's got a wonderful voice, and also still manages to make emotion come through the mask he wears throughout almost the entire movie. His performance is terrific, as is Natalie Portman's.<br/><br/>The story and writing are fantastic. It moves at a good pace.

The film was far more nuanced and complex than I had been expecting. Hugo Weaving was great- if unseen, and Natalie Portman has more than made up for that last Star Wars film.

","Years ago I read the graphic novel that is the basis for the movie. I was overjoyed to hear it was being made, but dismayed to discover that the original writer Alan Moore was unhappy with it. Now I've seen it I understand why. The relationship between Evey and V has been romanticised far too much, obviously to broaden the movie's appeal, and this softens the impact of V's behaviour; he is acting out of love and defence now, instead of righteous vengeance seeking anarchy. I can't remember the twist about the St.Mary's/Three Waters outbreak in the original either, but it does serve its purpose to make the totalitarian government look even more manipulative than V. Praise should go to Stephen Rea & Tim Pigott-Smith for their performances. I felt that the movie needed a stronger hand behind the camera though - it all looks a little flat and feels lifeless at times. I'm still happy with the film and glad it was made at last. Now we need some brave fool to try and film Moore's other classic, Watchmen."

V was a brilliantly tortured character, showing that sometimes violence is necessary for the greater good. The lesbian romance in the middle was the most unnecessary scenes i think I've ever seen. i understand the point they were trying to make but it could have been a Muslim or jew instead of a lesbian surely. the ending was a little disappointing, it went out with more of a whimper then a bang, but i spose that was the point, people power and all that.

OH MAN ! ! ! ! ! and natalie portman, I hated her from I don't know when, its like those people that u don't know anything about, but happen upon all the time, after some time there's this animosity between you(another of the seinfeld effects). Then, I saw her in this movie, and it was like, hey this girls good, but hey isn't she natalie, I would have hated her thin look in any other movie, but in this movie, she was just sooooooooooo cute.<br/><br/>i cant say she was hot but for that one scene, as a school girl with pig tails, i was laughing so hard, man, the whole situation, the Bishop going on about how he ever doubted her beauty, and even when she tells him that V is coming to kill him, ""oh, wonderful, i like this game""....<br/><br/>getting back to the story, in the future, in this future, there are no flying cars, no high tech gizmos, nothing, you don't even wonder about all those when watching this movie, its a more realistic future, than all the other versions Hollywood throws at us.<br/><br/>America is no longer the big brother, Britain has become this totalitarian place, by the course of the movie we find out that we are living in a place where we are assured peace, as long as we follow the rules, rules broken, people dead. of course, sounds like the same old same old, but hey, this one looks really thought thru.<br/><br/>So along comes V. this guy has his own personal vendetta against those who created this government, the party if u will. the party members, the chancellor. although his history is not really clear, we can relate to him as the lone ranger kinda guy. and the girl, who is always afraid (the average person), somehows tangles up with him, Coincidence??? ANd stephen rea, the cop who everybody writes off, but is always clued in, was perfect. this movie may sound like any other movie based on future and revolution and revenge. BUt somehow, somehow, this one hits the mark.<br/><br/>I urge everyone to watch this movie, its just awesome, I didn't really expect this movie to be so good."

","I can't reconcile all the other gushing comments with the extremely average film I saw. It is neither tense nor complex, the script is hammy beyond belief (as graphic novel adaptations usually are), Hugo Weaving is OK, Natalie Portman is not challenged, John Hurt pulls a deranged David Blunkett, Stephen Fry is OK, Stephen Rea is underserved, everyone else is window-dressing. The visual homage to 1984 is obvious. The FX are the high point (although not as good as The Matrix), but then you knew that going in. It really sagged, could have done with 1hr of cuts. It's political enough, it's not a love story, it doesn't have enough suspense to be a thriller.

","This movie was very good. I truly believe that the Wachowski brothers did Alan Moore's comic justice when they wrote this. Hugo Weaving was excellent as V. Before this he was typecast in my mind as Agent Smith from the Matrix. Natalie Portman had a very convincing accent and was perfect for the part of Evey. Stephen Rea and John Hurt rounded off this cast. It was perfect. The movie takes place in a futuristic fascist England. The government commits unspeakable crimes against its own citizens, but everyone is afraid to speak up. Evey, after being attacked by the police, is rescued by a man known only as V. Over time she begins to realize who V really is, an idea. V, although trying to help the people of England, has his own scores to settle before carrying out his plan to set the people of England free. Very good movie, makes you think about the direction our own government is headed in."

Since both were never seen dead, or confirmed dead by anyone else, you're lead to believe that V made it all up to gain Evey's support, which was necessary for him to complete his mission at the end. Am I on the right track here? I have decided to not give my opinion of this movie, because I don't feel like arguing it with anyone.

","The long introduction irritated me. I wanted to throw my everyday concerns away and escape to a fantasy world, but this movie offered a view particular to trenchant lefties that wouldn't let me go, counter to my experience as it was. Fry and Portman and Weaving seemed to me to be three experts on a current affair hypothetical - chosen as they agree on their hatred of conservative values. Unlike the views of minority groups on current affairs, however, the intro is essential to the story, and the overall story is escalating and gripping. What is Fry's character's relationship with Evie (Portman's character)? Who is V? Why is V so vengeful? Insight to the characters is brilliantly given through old movie snippets, such as ""The count of Monte Christo."" One still feels that not all loose ends are tied. But then Tolkein didn't do THAT with his LOTR, so it's not really essential when important issues are settled. Portman is a great actress. She explores Evie deeply, and one feels that Evie is a real person, with elements of two dimensional shallowness and great depth. It is easy to play a character of conviction, but playing those who doubt their own reality is very hard. Evie grows and changes and Portman takes us on this journey. Fry too shows us much of himself. I felt he wrote his own role. I'm Australian. Weaving can do no wrong. Conservatives are all right wing fascists. And stupid. And evil. But then this is fantasy .. even if some feel this reinforces their reality."
"zeratul22","7","0","2","2 April 2006"," V: The Film Vs. The Graphic Novel
","To each film there is a welcome avenue for healthy debate. I very much encourage this debate; it means that a film is provoking an emotional or just a basic response from the viewer. Everyone is allowed to argue whichever point they find has merit. Whether they liked the movie or hated it is by all means their point to make. This film however, happens to be loosely based on a pre-existing work of fiction and though the film and the original graphic novel should be considered separate entities, it's important to at least recognize this dynamic. Alan Moore has a wide history of writing very far reaching and critically acclaimed graphic novels and novels alike, he has also garnered his share of criticism. I am by no means forcing you to admire Moore or even sympathize with him by writing this, I am only trying to redirect the mass to consider that for better or worse, the film is only one side to this idea of V. I will say this now, I liked the film, being a staunched supporter of the graphic novel notwithstanding. I thought the film was visually brilliant and culminated very well on screen. There are huge discrepancies between the films V and the novels V. I admired the film-V for his emotion and zest and at times his morbidly comedic disposition. Morally however, the film-V is almost an entirely different character then the GN-V. The films changes to V's character were understandable I must conceit (given the porting over to a film audience) but convey a completely different moral code. The GN-V is a far more convincing madman, in that he does not break down sobbing or fall in love with Evey. The GN-V is a far more politically charged lone wolf, preaching anarchy and forwarding his extremist agenda. The film-V does this in spades as well, don't get me wrong, but a lot of V's strength in the GN is sucked out of him for his film appearance. In both the film and the GN, V is a Romantic character: he transcends his dementia and retrieves a very valuable truth (that he would soon impart to Evey) and acts with a passion to his cause. We all know this though, and you don't need to read the GN and see the film to understand this, all I'm saying is this: If you watched the movie, you have a personal responsibility to read the GN. I say this because the film, though doing a swell job by and by, collectively kills the GN-V. I had this realization as soon as the credits rolled in the theater. The politically unforgiving and morally absolute GN-V has been replaced by a completely different V, one that is ruthless and intriguing to be sure, but entirely different from the one I fell in love with from the GN. Whether you like Alan Moore or not is irrelevant, since you can't compare these two pieces of expression in the same arena. I'm not saying the GN is better then the film or vice versa only that the architect of this character and intern the story needs to be considered fully. The biggest concern I had with the film had nothing to do with the content but the implications that the film offers this generation. Will people know this film was based on something? Will they know it's a completely different piece of work? Will they think V for Vendetta the film is V for Vendetta as a whole? To surmise, like the movie or hate the movie, that's not in question, but whether you like it or hate it, do it honestly. The film-V and the GN-V are two completely different dudes, and you can chose to like or hate them too, but I stress that they are morally and spiritually diverse."

","To begin with, I hated the Matrix. It felt like I was watching someone play a video game. The action was unrealistic, and I was unable to find any characters that I could identify with. At that point, I hated the Wachowski brothers. Then I went to see V for Vendetta because I'm kind of a comic book geek. I had high hopes, and they were met. In my opinion, one of the best parts was V's soliloquy at the beginning where he seemingly uses the entire ""V"" section of the dictionary. I was amazed at that feat of script writing. Furthermore, when V fought, it was as realistic as a hero story can get. He was shot, and he bled. He didn't do back flips off walls and stop bullets in midair. He took his shots, and gave them back. The direction of the action scenes was impeccable; I found myself believing them, and I was overjoyed to see that no one fired a pistol one-handed. Then I found out the Wachowski brothers were involved here. I was shocked; I thought they only did vaguely metaphysical schlock for fifteen year olds. This was downright excellent, even if it diverged massively from the source material. There were a few ambiguities, a few characters not explored quite enough, and some times when they tried to make the movie too ""recent"" for my tastes, but other than that, I was satisfied. I'd end this with the rhyme, but I'm assuming everyone else who like the movie already did."

","""V for Vendetta"" is an interesting movie. The story unfolds slowly, setting up the main characters, their back story and the setting very well. It introduces connections to Guy Fawkes, the Count of Monte Cristo and more recent fair such as ""1984"". The relationship between V and Evey develops slowly as V plots his revolution, convincingly showing how someone might be torn between the goal of the revolution and the means to achieve it.<br/><br/>Halfway through, however, as V's deadline approaches, the movie takes a ludicrous turn. Evey's character changes abruptly. This change, as near as I can tell, is made only to move the plot (both movie and V's) along. Although we are shown the reasons for this change of personality, to me it rang hollow and the story suffers as a result.<br/><br/>""V"" is an interesting movie to watch and to reflect on given today's reality.

And there are, indeed, flashes of brilliance, both in the witty wordplay and in the finely textured performances from Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry. And the action's not bad either. But the ending felt really hollow. I walked out of the theater and found myself wanting to go watch ""Batman Begins"" again. The psychology of fear and symbols, not to mention revenge and redemption, was more realistically explored there. <br/><br/>Also, ""Equilibrium"" felt much more fully realized, as a world, then ""V For Vendetta's.""

","V FOR VENDETTA <br/><br/>I honestly had little clue what the film was about going into it. I knew a general idea of the controversial topics the film covers, but had no idea how they went about doing it. All I knew was that the movie looked stylish and was generating buzz... so I was happy to go. In the end, I walked away having never been bored... but also unsure as to whether I actually enjoyed the piece or not.<br/><br/>V FOR VENDETTA is a very ambitious film. It takes on a topic much in the same way that MUNICH did (though I know the messages, themes, and histories of the pieces are completely incomparable... I'm not comparing them on anything besides the approach to their topics). Both are films this past year that attempted to present a neutral, unbiased view of terrorism and violence and the pros and cons it brings. For me though, this stance may be bold, but ultimately it does not service the films.<br/><br/>V FOR VENDETTA is a confusing, constantly shifting film with a lot of glossy qualities. It took every ounce of my focus to keep up with what was going on... and the plot is constantly shifting. This made things remain interesting to me, however it was never a film that I could sit back and soak up. It tells the story of a ""freedom fighter"" of sorts named V... and he terrorizes the country in order to take down Parliament. He believes that people should not fear their government... it should be the other way around. And through violence towards the governmental establishment, he aims to fix the problem.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a girl named Evie (played by Natalie Portman) gets mixed up in his game. Her parents died fighting for some of V's ideals, and Evie is torn between helping the nations leading terrorist and fighting for what she ultimately believes in.<br/><br/>However, this summary of the plot is a shameful generalization. Their is so much more in the film than that basic outline. Everything the film does it does with beautiful stylization and confident direction. All the elements are there, but for an action movie like this things are ultimately a little too complicated.<br/><br/>I feel like the film they were trying to make and the audience they were trying to reach was far less ambitious then the actual message they were trying to put into everything. For someone to go into this movie completely unaware of the twisting plot that lies ahead of them it all ends up being a bit overwhelming.<br/><br/>I can't fault the movie b/c it is definitely well produced and features strong production elements on every side. The performances are also very solid if nothing remarkable. However, like I said, their was a little bit too much of a message and plot to fit into the movie they hyped this film up to be.<br/><br/>Perhaps I need to watch it again so that I can be familiar with things and sit back and enjoy it more so then focus on following the difficult plot.

I liked it up until the torture/false imprisonment sequence. That's when it just started falling apart. The problem with this sequence is they sacrificed telling the story for making a point, and one that wasn't even all that believable and quite lame to be honest. Then, after that the Wachowski brothers thought ""Oh crap, we need some romantic interest, let's have them dance."" That and the kiss were just plain, good ole fashioned stupid. Then, that whole bit when Evey said V was her ""father, mother, friend. He's you, he's me, he's all of us."" Gag me, please! My best guess (as it was such bad writing in that moment) was that they were trying to make a point about the nature of V somehow being in the nature of us all. Just another load of Wachowski pretension.<br/><br/>And do we really need to see V coming out of the fire 19 times?<br/><br/>And this: Evey Hammond: I don't want you to die. V: That is the most beautiful thing you could have ever given me. was the lamest death scene I think I might have ever seen. This scene was also quite emotionally ineffective because long before this, I not only didn't care if V died, I wanted him to.

Hugo Weaving, with his rumbling voice, was perfectly cast as the masked, ruthless hero. There were some parts in the movie where it dragged out a little longer than I would like, but overall, I never felt truly bored throughout the whole experience. My one major criticism of the movie is that the evil characters were so repungant, that I have lost any emotional connection to the movie. There never were any doubts that they ""deserved to die"" for what they have done to Britain, and yet the climax of the movie was supposed to be the emotional struggle Evey has. Another criticism is that the movie was so over the top in its delivery against propaganda, that it is a propaganda itself. Bad characters were presented as ruthless bigots who had absolutely no room for negotiations for other people's values, and yet the victims were constantly portrayed as perfect people, filled with love and care. I suppose this is the sort of news we are being fed these days, with clear cut black and white, and no middle ground."

And they treat you like a child, when giving you a plot to follow. but in seeing V for Vendetta i feel relieved that i haven't payed another 7.50 to see a kids film. Instead i got a mature and topical film dealing with politics and freedom.<br/><br/>It is about a mysterious Guy Thawkes masked freedom fighter named V (Theatrically played by Hugo Weaving) who lurks in the shadows of a futuristic totalitarian Britan. But when rescuing Evey (Natalie Portman)from the corrupt future police called Fingermen. He feels that he has found an ally. He invites her to his show of destroying the old Bailey. He then hijacks a television studio, admits to destroying the Old Bailey and asks the people of London to gather outside the Houses of Parliament next 5th of November. The government hires a detective who relentlessly tries to track down and kill V while the detective himself is discovering the governments dark secrets. Whilst V gets revenge on the people who made him who he is, and give the people of Britain hope by succeeding in his plan and destroying the government. <br/><br/>Because i haven't read the comic i cannot compare it but, the films is still very good and a Shakespeare style performance from Hugo Weaving as V is very enjoyable, whilst a convincing English accent from Natalie Portman is also satisfying. The films plot is complex and shows the scenes of the governments terrifying secrets really well.

","This futuristic yarn about freedom fighters has something in common with Johnny Debb's dark story ""From Hell"" (2001) about Jack the Ripper - both are adapted from graphic novels by the same author, which may explain other similarities such as the fancy knife work.<br/><br/>Coming also from the Wachowski Brothers (written, but not directed this time), VfV however has the good sense of sparing the audience of the pseudo philosophising mumbo-jumbo that almost destroyed in the last two of the Matrix trilogy. Instead, it stays with the good old heroic formula of a tragic hero's quest for freedom of the people. Set in the year 2020, the time span of the movie is exactly one year, as the event unfolds from the mysterious V's (Hugo Weaver) blowing up Old Bailey to fulfilment of his promise/prediction a year later, mainly through the eyes of a young girl Evey (Natalie Portman) he rescues on the street from two secret police turned rapist.<br/><br/>Just about everyone who has seen VfV will associate the relationship between V and Evey to The Phantom of the Opera - mentor and protegee, older man and young girl. But one particular scene triggers another association in my mind - towards the end of the movie, as V saunters languidly into the room and find Evey at the jute box, coming back to him, the flavour of ""Eliza, where the hell are my slippers"" is just unmistakable.<br/><br/>It's just me, but I do feel a little bit cheated when the admission price I paid doesn't entitle me to have even a single glimpse of one of the leads. To rectify this, during most of V's dialogue, I closed my eyes and visualise Hugo Weaver's face behind the Guy Fawkes mask (which is really an illusion because that face, regardless of whoever plays is, would actually be a mutated face that may not even look human). With Weaver's distinctive voice and equally distinctive facial features, it works! As long as we are on faces, another star, John Hurt (playing dictator Adam Sutler), is just one  face that is, and can almost be mistaken as the twin brother of the Great Wizard of Oz. Still on faces, Portman's is, needless to say, a beautiful one. But it's her costumes here that are dazzling, which, most interestingly, are described by one female critic as ""would make Amidala jealous"" while by one male critic as ""will have fetishists drooling"". There you go.<br/><br/>But what about the movie itself? It has a bit of everything  spectacle, action, suspense, melodrama, heroism, conspiracy, political satire, science fiction, even a little chuckle here and there. Can't complain that it's not entertaining, but it doesn't rise above anything, from any angle. Frankly, I find the 8.1 (at the time of writing) average rating in IMDb quite puzzling."

A lot of clueless conversation..but I kept saying to myself..it will get better.<br/><br/>At half of the movie things started to get better/but still without any clue on how this person got his power/money/training to do all of what he is doing.<br/><br/>Only the last 15 minutes of the movie have nice acting and action scenes.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that the V character is just shallow and I couldn't get any clue how did he posses money??where are these people that are working with him to send 10,000 V masks to all the city?!!!.how does he make all these stuff when he is sitting inside his underground house??!!!<br/><br/>I only gave 5 for the idea and the acting."

","This movie left me undecided on whether or not I liked it when I left the theater. I enjoyed the action of the movie, particularly the fight scene. But the thing that really bothered me about this movie was the ideology of V. This movie promotes terrorism. Or perhaps 'terrorism' is in the eye of the beholder? I just don't agree with the idea that 'blowing up a building can change the world'. I don't think blowing things up is a very good way of telling your government you want things changed. Also, the political statement made in the movie about current affairs just sidetracks the plot and did nothing but make me sigh and lose respect for the movie, when I was already undecided on how I felt about it due to weak plot and unrealistic dialogue. Also, Natalie Portman is hot, but not with a shaved head..."

","This movie was lame. If you liked it you're lame. The movie did not have enough action in it and was mostly about Natalie Portman reading stories about lesbians while in jail. There was also too much crying in this movie. The message behind this movie came off cheesily with their trying to be deep with messeges about freedom. This movie did not have enough of V doing kickass stuff. The character of V was great but he was not the star so much as Natalie Portman. Bottom line: If you were expecting tons of action this movie is not for you. Bottom bottom line: If you liked this movie you're lame. I need to make up for the minimal lines here."
"gregpiper","6","0","3","25 March 2006"," V for Very Silly
","It's not an overstatement to say this movie is based on a very paranoid, far-left view of any government that has an antiterrorism strategy. It seems directly intended as a polemic against the Bush and Blair governments, but it's not especially coherent. The government persecutes both homosexuals AND any hint of Muslim sympathy? That's just silly, but it's borne out of this post-9/11 delusion in certain quarters that the world is ruled by Christian fundamentalists and Jewish warmongers. The society presented in this film shows no sign of the stress or tangible fear of living under a totalitarian government - you'd think the random kidnappings and murders would create some sort of palpable horror in these people, who look pretty normal. It's ludicrous to assume that they'd vote for this government out of fear. For all of V's lofty rhetoric, he's really not a freedom fighter so much as a crafty anarchist (there's even a nice reference to the Sex Pistols' ""Anarchy in the UK"" thrown in). Basically, this movie is how a small but vocal segment of the West sees their own societies - under constant surveillance, all news invented, with nefarious behind the scenes activities on par with the fascists of WWII, yet utterly normal from the outside. It's based on the frustration these deluded activists feel that they can't convince their fellow citizens of the great conspiracy. It's a shame that John Hurt went from the great but failed dissident in the movie version of ""1984"" to this sad clone adapted for the 21st century."
"rboy8","8","0","2","21 March 2006"," lets understand what works for film, o.k.?
","i am sitting here after reading several of the 'hated it' comments for this film. i really want some of you that were so livid about this movie to relax, take a deep breath, and listen please to what i have to say. ready? O.K. i will be the first to admit that i have never read the V graphic novels and the film is my introduction to this character. you know, when a studio decides to produce something there is that unfortunate thing called money that somehow always rears its ugly head. as much as some people involved with this movie would have liked to remain completely true to the original writings, the money thing, coupled with the ego thing, and the power thing all combine to sometimes get in the way of what perhaps should have been up on the screen. as an introduction to this character, i felt that V for Vendetta served its purpose well. can't any of you realize that in a production of this sort there are always too many chiefs and not enough indians. i would challenge any of you ""armchair directors and fan-boy critics to make anything even remotely as good as what was done by the people at Warner Brothers. Hugo Weaving was tremendous as the main character. wearing a mask for the entire film without a facial reveal and yet still being able to convey such a sense of humanity in the process. as for ms portman...what a great sense of relief she must have had after coming off of those lifeless ""Star Wars"" films. she truly sank her teeth into this one. sometimes i feel that you that are truly disappointed were so worked up before you even saw this film, what with all of your websites, fan conventions and the like. as much as some of you would like everything to be exactly what you want it to be come hell or high water need to understand that this is the vision of the director,cinematographer, art director, scriptwriter, and oh yes the money-men. i wish that you could have seen the movie with an open mind and a fresh perspective. the music was perfect. the effects during the last fight in the station were ""illustrative"". get it? when natalie portman realizes that she has been held captive by ""V"" and not the government, were you sitting in your seats so bored and smug that you could not feel the epiphany her character was going through? i am a movieholic. i should be in a twelve frame program. i have seen a countless number of films of all kinds good and bad, but contrary to all of you nay-sayers, this film works and it works well. simple, straight, and true. i would challenge some of you to at least rent it again when it comes to DVD and give it the true chance it deserves. lets put it this way.... i remember when the first batman film was released. many of the same kind of fan-boys screamed in horror when it was revealed that michael keaton would be batman. sacrilege they cried! the film will be ruined!i thought it was perfect. Keaton made the batman character his own. i do admit that the franchise fell on hard times before the superb batman begins breathed new life into it. i also imagine that the writer of the ""V"" novels took his name off the production for one reason or another. but the truism in Hollywood is that everyone will promise whatever it takes to get something made regardless of whether those specific promises are kept or not. that is the reality of it. so i am asking you to understand that even if this movie was not the ""pitch perfect"" one that you had to see........it was done as best as could be expected coming out of a major studio as it were. i highly recommend this picture and plan to purchase a copy when it is released. i would ask all of you that were disappointed to give this another viewing with an open mind. thanks"
"Red-Barracuda","3","0","4","25 March 2006"," Not in the same league as the comic
","If you have not read the graphic novel of V For Vendetta by Alan Moore and David Lloyd then, chances are, you may enjoy this movie. But Being a huge fan of the comic, I found it impossible to come to this film without any expectations. And, although I understand the impossibility of keeping everything in adaptions of books or graphic novels, I also feel that it is possible to retain the essence of the original work. Unfortunately, with the adaption of V For Vendetta, the essence has been almost entirely lost.<br/><br/>The storyline is changed around considerably. Which, in itself, should not be a major problem but why the filmmakers felt the need to add in so much of their own material is beyond me. Surely, the running time should have been used to cram as much from the original work as possible, rather than filling it with poor original material, such as the TV show sequence? Not only that, but some of the things they do show from the original are incredibly badly done, i.e. where V emerges from the fire at Larkhill Resettlement Camp, when reading this segment in the comic it gives me goose-bumps, in the film, however, it is highly cheesy; appallingly badly done. The characterisation is another area where the film is a poor comparison to the comic. Where Alan Moore created unsensational but truly believable characters, the film contains a host of cardboard goodies and baddies (compare John Hurt's Adam Sutler with the original Adam Susan); it is surely unusual for a comic to have the more human characters? The atmosphere of the original is downbeat and edgy. The film could have capitalised on this by adding music that helps create a feeling of mystery and dread. Unfortunately, however, the music by Dario Marianelli is extremely dull and adds nothing to the overall atmosphere.<br/><br/>For someone not familiar with the original work, the film could be quite enjoyable. But, because I have such a huge respect for the comic, I feel that the film is a serious missed opportunity. It is 25 years since the original series appeared in Warrior magazine. It seems like a long time to wait for a movie adaption that so blatantly misses the mark."
"grendelkhan","7","0","2","24 March 2006"," Good film, but a ""Cliffs Notes"" version of the story.
","It is hard to comment on a rich story, such as V for Vendetta, within a 1,000 words. It is a story of ideas, filled with rich language and subtle nuances. It has iconic imagery and liberal use of symbolism. It presents deep political arguments and moral ambiguity. The film captures most of these themes, but in a more compact and simplistic version. It is faithful to segments of the story, but drastically alters the course of the tale.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good, across the cast. Stephen Rea is a particular standout as Finch, the detective in pursuit of V. He is good man who has lost his way. He made choices that he thought were in the best interest of his society, but soon learns how wrong they were. Hugo Weaving is able to move beyond the limitations of a mask, using only voice and body language. Natalie Portman sports a dodgy accent, but conveys the innocence and growth of her character with skill. John Hurt provides a bit of irony, as he looms over video screens, like the Big Brother that tormented him in 1984. Stephen fry brings a touch of humor, some tragedy, and a large dose of humanity to the film.<br/><br/>The film mostly captures the themes of the source, that true power in a society derives from the people, not the government. Totalitarian states rule through fear, and when the populace learns that it has nothing to fear from its government, it is able to tear it down and replace it with something better. It mostly ignores anarchy, as a political concept, but does capture the feelings of euphoria that come over the populace, when they are freed of surveillance and control. It shows that labels like ""terrorist"" and ""freedom fighter"" depend greatly on which side of a conflict you are on.<br/><br/>Fans of the graphic novel will find the film a mixed bag: the basic themes are there, but the subtleties and depth is lacking. Those unfamiliar may find some of the ideas challenging, but worthy of discussion. The visuals are memorable and, generally, in service of the story. There is much greater depth than most recent ""genre"" works, but there is much room for improvement. The film builds to a stirring climax, albeit a simplistic one. This is definitely a film that stirs discussion, and is very courageous and timely."

Although the plot seemed to stray a few times the overlying story was really effective and full credit to the writers for producing such a challenging and thought provoking film.

This is the epitome of what a Hollywood film should be. I believe it is the best comic book/Graphic novel adaptation ever conveyed on screen and since i am a fan of Spiderman and X Men that's saying something.

","I was excited to see this movie since I saw the first preview for it many months ago. After finally seeing the film, I must admit that it wasn't what I had expected. All the trailers depict the film as an action film, or at least something similar to The Matrix in that respect. When comparing this film to The Matrix, it differs drastically in that area with only 2 or 3 ""action scenes"" in the entire film. But what the Wachowskis did bring to V for Vendetta was their unparalleled use of words, symbols, allegories, and metaphors. This movie is (just like The Matrix Trilogy) one that will bring new feelings and ideas to the viewer every time they watch it again.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving are amazing. You couldn't find a better pair. Weaving brings his incredible talent for passionate monologues and Portman is everything that you could want in an actress.<br/><br/>Great film for those who saw The Matrix, understood the plot, saw the metaphors and philosophy, and didn't just classify it as a ""groundbreaking action flick."""

","I really enjoyed the film and thought it was a very original script. However after living in Scotland for 15 years where the fifth of November is a national holiday, i know that the Wachowski brothers needed to do a little more research into the story of Guy Fawkes. At the beginning of the film he is hung for treason; in reality Guy Fawkes was burned at the stake. In fact in Britain Guy Fawkes dummies are burned on bonfires as a reenactment of this event. Just pointing out a small error. Apart from that i thought the ideas behind the film were excellent and the fight scenes spectacular. Possibly V seemed a little too indestructible, but still i'm not complaining too much about the film as a whole."
"PreOre72","9","0","2","23 March 2006"," Everything ""The Matrix"" never was.
","Alan Moore, Britain's amazing comic book maestro is the heart and soul behind the comic ""V for Vendetta"" and although he doesn't want anything to do with this film it is, in fact, a well done intelligent adaptation of Moore's politically charged masterpiece.<br/><br/>The Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix Trilogy, Bound) adapted the screenplay from Moore's work with care and respect. The central character is a hard working young woman in Great Britian in the near future, portrayed by Natalie Portman who, as she says, ""is scared all the time"". The reason why is because Britian is now a totalitarian regime run by a larger than life dictator High Chancellor Adam Sutler who doesn't talk to his citizens but instead yells at them with a fury of hellfire and brimstone that scares all into submission. He jumped into power after disease spread throughout Britian and the United States of America is now a third world country. In this world they live in, many things are banned including music, classic films and even butter.<br/><br/>Although the citizens just sit in front of their TV's and take everything in without question there is someone who will stand up against the rising of the tide. A man only known as V. A man whose face is covered with a Guy Fawlkes mask, who is dressed from head to toe in black, and a long black wig that falls to the side accentuating the ivory mask he wears. Huge Weaving of ""The Matrix"" trilogy and ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga portrays V with a fire and tenacity that is needed for such an eccentric character. Fawlkes, was a political martyr who was murdered 400 years earlier because he planned on blowing up Parliament. That now becomes V's newly adopted mission. Evey, his newly adopted sidekick. A beautiful young woman whom can help topple a government if only she can find the strength inside herself to do so.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully crafted by first time director James McTeigue, who previously worked as assistant director on ""The Matrix"" trilogy and ""Attack of the Clones"", the Star Wars travesty. Here McTeigue paints glorious portrait of a dark and dank London, where being afraid is as common as the curfew. The cinematography is captivating, the action is relentlessly paced, and overall, the film works, not only on its' own, but as a successful adaptation.<br/><br/>All in all, an entertaining and politically fueled action feast.<br/><br/>***Please note that I didn't make comparisons with this film to the modern day world and what is happening with Iraq. The film is based on a comic written during the 80's. Long before the current events that envelop us in today's world."

But I can't say that those arguments don't have some merit. I don't think that this movie was a swipe at the Bush administration, so much as a warning against a large, intrusive government. This film put a lot of things into perspective as far as the way the government treats its citizenry. I think the best moment in the movie is when V states that ""People should not fear their government. The government should fear its citizens.""

Had the siblings simply taken Moore's story and adapted it for the screen, I believe the film would have been amazing. Unfortunately, we'll never know.<br/><br/>Instead of simply taking the story and adapting it for the screen, the Wachowski's decided instead to use the movie as a vehicle for belittling the US and the war on terror. While ""V"" is not the worst of the hate-America and hate-Bush films, the simple fact that it references the subject, however slightly, is enough to turn my stomach. This has nothing to do with love for Bush of which I have little but is rather concerned with the fact that I cannot go to a movie anymore without having a political agenda shoved down my throat.<br/><br/>LISTEN UP -- Directors and producers in Hollywood!!!

","Anyone who saw Ridley Scott's visually mesmerizing ""1984"" commercial originally aired only once on Super Bowl will recognize the extent of that influence for this movie.<br/><br/>Larry and Andy are obviously devoted readers of classic literature and Hideo Kojima's video game franchise Metal Gear Solid as both of these influences are instantly recognized throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The former may be recognizable through reciting Shakespeare dialogues; the latter...what? Only if you've played one or all of the Metal Gear Solid video games for the PlayStation and paid attention watching the directing and editing style of cinematic cut scenes, then you will know. Wachowski brothers paid homage to movie fan and Metal Gear creator & game planner Hideo Kojima as a subtle eye wink.<br/><br/>Besides the trivial banter above, V For Vendetta is an interesting movie to watch, albeit a radical and risky major studio movie not seen since Fight Club (a movie I dislike intensely).<br/><br/>Natalie Portman does her best portraying the victim taken under the wing of a masked mystery man who only goes by the name V. A little too stiff, though -- at times she looks like she's portraying yet another cardboard character standby figure in a big Hollywood movie to allow the breathing space for detectives, villains and the mystery man to ramble and commit the deeds to move the movie along from point A to Z.<br/><br/>V seems to have the penchant for spouting pretentious & rambling monologues dreamed up by the Wachowski brothers as if they have to tell the world their unique point of view left out from The Matrix franchise as well as showboating their gift in screenplay writing. That introductionary monologue which frequently use the words starting with the letter 'v' is ludicrously perplexing and cheesily pretentious, just like The Architect's Ph.D professor lecture of a psycho-tech babble monologue in the vapid fun but pointlessly bloated movie The Matrix Reloaded.<br/><br/>The homosexual element in a certain part of the movie feels tackled on, as if the Wachowski brothers have to show their love for female bisexuals and lesbians. Judging from the fact in the trivia section for this movie, they wrote the first draft in the mid-90's, around the time they developed and produced the debut thriller Bound (partly because they have to prove they do have enough talents to make The Matrix Trilogy to convince the skeptical studio executives to greenlight), also featuring lesbian protagonists. This element has little to do with the main story of the movie and only serve as a subplot of no significant importance that pad the length of the movie to over two hours. If anything, Wachowski brothers should do the lesbian answer to Brokeback Mountain. High Art this movie isn't supposed to be.<br/><br/>Other than the complaints above, V For Vendetta serve as a prophetically relevant movie for troubled times in this increasingly unstable world, on par with George Clooney's efficient drama Good Night and Good Luck and Steven Spielberg's ambiguous espionage thriller Munich.<br/><br/>V For Vendetta derive some portions of elements from George Orwell's iconic masterwork 1984 on the iron-fist grip of totalitarianism -- I haven't read the comic book series which inspired this movie -- but I think Kurt Wimmer's movie Equilibrium did it slightly better, to the point in tighter editing and with less thematic bombast.<br/><br/>A noble work of film-making art under the Hollywood studio system, but not quite as good and mesmerizing as the first time I saw Equilibrium when I had zero expectation. It's ironic John Hurt portrays a despotic tyrant in V For Vendetta as a flip side of the coin after he starred as a main protagonist in the film adaptation of 1984 released in theatres 22 years ago.<br/><br/>** 1/2"

","In the 1980's, famous comic writer Alan Moore wrote what is considered one of his best graphic novels and a masterpiece of sequential storytelling, V for Vendetta. Now it is adapted for film with a screenplay written by the Wachowski Brothers. Honestly, I was not looking forward to this movie when the buzz around it started. I did not fall in love with The Matrix like everyone else, sure the action and effects were amazing but the story and characters did nothing for me. I was expecting V to be even less thrilling in my eyes. It had been pushed back from a November release to March, Alan Moore had disowned it, and the trailer, which featured a bald Natalie Portman and hero that looked like Michael Jackson, was awful. My expectations could not have been lower.<br/><br/>Well, color me shocked because I liked V for Vendetta quite a bit! Let me make one thing very clear: This is not an action picture. The advertisements and other people might label it as such, but do not go into it expecting that. I can only really thing of maybe 3 short fight scenes in the entire thing. The story takes place in an alternate reality futuristic tyrannical Britain, V first appears as a brooding vigilante who saves Evey (Natalie Portman) one night from police who were going to rape and kill her. From there she becomes a part of his schemes to topple the oppressive government. I really do not want to give much more away, but I will say it becomes much more interesting then it sounds. The character of V is the driving force behind the movie, which is odd because we never really get to know much about who he (or her) is under the Guy Fawkes mask. The past of the character is explained throughout the film along with how the dictator came into power, but the exact identity of V is never revealed. I suppose it remains up to the viewer to decide. I have a few theories myself and I would love to share them if this was not a non-spoiler review. He was interesting because I do not believe the audience will agree with all of his actions. He is an assassin killing those who wronged him without mercy, as well as a terrorist blowing up famous landmarks and buildings in London. Is V a terrorist or freedom fighter? Would an A for Anarchy be more appropriate? Whatever people think of him, he is no doubt one of the more intriguing protagonist movies have recently offered. Another compelling character in the film was Detective Finch who has been assigned to track down V. In his search he finds the truth and in one of my favorite scenes predicts the chilling consequences of V's actions. Of course, there is the geek favorite Miss. Portman. Even with a shaved head and lame accent she is incredibly beautiful to watch.<br/><br/>V for Vendetta is a movie with a hell of a lot of ideas, even if not all of them are fleshed out. I found it scary how a story written some 20 years ago could hold so much relevance in the world we live in today. It is a commentary on political oppression and revolution told while bringing up subjects such as nuclear weapons, government testing, corrupt government figures, terrorism, and religious believes, and homosexuality. It does not always make sense, but it is always absorbing. I had never read Moore's original work, but I might get around to checking it out after this movie. I suspect some people expecting a non stop action romp will be disappointed, so do not go in expecting such. Be prepared for a film that will throw a lot of ideas your way and expect you to sort through them and find a message for yourself. In the finale of V for Vendetta I was not assaulted with cheap thrills, but a thoughtful and explosive exclaimation point to all the thoughts the film shoved into my brain. Anything that can do that is something worth seeing."

","""V for Vendetta"" was a comic book series (later published as a graphic novel) written by the now-legendary writer Alan Moore and penciled by David Lloyd. The complex sci-fi tale of the terrorist codenamed ""V"" and his fight against the fascist British government in a near future setting was the first of many successes in Moore's career in the comic book industry.<br/><br/>After many failed attempts to adapt Alan Moore's works to film (resulting in the writer's hatred to the idea and disowning of the final product), ""V for Vendetta"" succeeds not only as a very good sci-fi film, but also as a good adaptation that, while deviating from the original storyline, it keeps the substance and keeps Moore's message consistent.<br/><br/>The plot follows Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman in futuristic London, who one night is about to be raped and murdered by the corrupt secret police, but is saved by the mysterious masked vigilante who calls himself ""V"" (Hugo Weaving). This way she becomes acquainted with the idealist terrorist and his personal crusade against the fascist government of the country, which will culminate with the destruction of the Houses of Parliament, mirroring Guy Fawkes' own attempt of blowing the building 400 years earlier on a 5th of November.<br/><br/>Directed by James McTeigue and adapted by the Wachowski brothers (known for ""The Matrix"" series), the film is a very good debut for McTeigue; who unlike the famous movies directed by his partners-in-crime, opts for a less flashy approach to action films and keeps the movie in tune with the original source novel. While the script done by the Wachowski moves away from the source novel making the film less complex (taking away most of the many complex subplots), the spirit of Moore's ""Vendetta"" remains the same and ""V"" remains a mysterious character right in the thin line between a villain and a hero.<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving excels as ""V"", giving the character the feeling of extreme idealism complete with the dramatic persona it needed. It is amazing the way his vocalization gives ""V"" a personality; as a masked figure, the character demanded a lot of Weaving really could convey true emotions through the Guy Fawkes' mask. Natalie Portman is a great young actress, but while her expressive face and powerful presence do the job well, at times she sounds odd with a British accent that seems to come and go.<br/><br/>Among a supporting cast of well-known British faces , Stephen Rea shines as police chief inspector Finch, who while trying to discover ""V""'s past ends up discovering his own government secret past. His performance is remarkable and very underrated, he nailed the character perfectly and it's a shame that his character weren't used more prominently.<br/><br/>And there is the movie's biggest flaw, the simplification of ""V for Vendetta"" leaves out a lot of great subplots, and a longer runtime would be better. However, it is understandable that what it is in print not always can be translated to a 120 minute film (specially Moore's complex story lines), and the Wachowski brothers deserve credit for making the most of the storyline resulting in an interesting sci-fi movie with a powerful and still valid message. In this movie they prove that with a solid backbone such as Moore's novel, they can do very good stuff.<br/><br/>James McTeigue shows promise as a director, and while his restrained style and focus on the plot rather than on the action may turn off hardcore action genre fans; the real fans of the comic book will be thankful. ""V for Vendetta"" is easily, the best adaptation of Alan Moore's work to date. 8/10"

","""People shouldn't be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people."" This is one of the many taglines surrounding the new futuristic political action film V for Vendetta. Do I truly believe that this saying is true? Yes, to only a certain extent though. In the past, we have seen what can happen if the people fight back. It's ended up in many protests, assassinations, and rebellions. Case in point, V for Vendetta, which is about corrupt governments and one man who changed everything, for the better.<br/><br/>Before being made into a feature film, V for Vendetta was a graphic novel: a very good one at that. Both the book and the film are about the same thing. The story is so good because it stays so faithful to the novels.<br/><br/>The film starts with a good pace, on Novenber the 5th with codename ""V"" (Hugo Weaving) and Evey (Natalie Portman). There is a curfew in effect and no one is allowed out after a certain time. V saves Evey from a horde of Fingerman (sort of like guards, making sure no one is outside after the curfew). He then takes her to a rooftop to witness the elaborate destruction of the Old Bailey. The government makes the public believe it was a demolition until V interrupts and warns that in a year from that day there will be a rebellion on the government. He tries to influence people to stand up for themselves and not to believe the fascist leader, High Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt). He states this on live TV, so everyone can hear. This leads to two detectives, Finch (Stephen Rea) and Dominic (Rupert Graves) looking for Evey, because she was implicated in the scenario, and may know the whereabouts of V. She hides out with V in his lair until she is ready to leave.<br/><br/>The story continues when Evey is taken by the crooked cops of London and is kept in a room while being tortured into saying the location of V. This takes place while V hunts down the three people that tested on him and many others a number of years ago in a detention center. This all leads up to an explosive and breathtaking ending that you need to see for yourself on the big screen. <br/><br/>The story and writing are fantastic. It moves at a good pace. There's just one point in the middle where the story seems to hit a dead end. The first half sets up an astonishing second half, where most of the action sequences take place and the best shots are. The character development is there for sure. All the characters are certain people at the start, and change ever so slowly into stronger people.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is an absolute jewel, and she shows off her ability charismatically. She has shown us her talent in comedies and dramas. Her performance had excellent written all over it. Hugo Weaving is a fast talking marvel. His mask does not stop him from expressing his feeling. He conveys anger, sadness and happiness with only his voice, which is hard. Stephen Rea is also very credible. He portrays a man faithful in his government and becomes a skeptic to the corruption. Less can be said about John Hurt, who just seems to like yelling a lot on a big screen; like an older, angrier Hitler. <br/><br/>Matrix directors Andy and Larry Wachowski create truly spectacular action sequences. The best thing they achieve is making the trails in the air of the daggers, used by V. It adds a great effect. <br/><br/>Like in the magnificent movie Sin City, V for Vendetta looks like a comic book. The set design is picturesque. The futuristic London is very fun to look at. It doesn't look too high tech or too dreary. It's wonderfully dark and mysterious. The costume design and cinematography are both beautiful. The ending sequences with all the people with V masks, walking down the streets is stunning. The part with the domino's in the shape of a V is also a spectacle to look at. <br/><br/>James McTeigue amazingly directs his first motion picture. He has a particular technique that creates an eye-popping gallery of a future with an ounce of hope. V for Vendetta is one of the most refreshing action films I've seen in a long time. Any enthusiast in the genre should check this out. I'm sure it will amaze you. The future in V for Vendetta may not have been picture perfect but I expect the movie to have an ideal future, with audiences, with critics and with mask wearing maniacs everywhere."

","The source material was an effective protest against Maggie Thatcher and the homophobic paranoia that attended the rise of AIDS infections in the UK. It might have played better back then than it does now. A truly hard sell to release a film about bombing British landmarks less than a year after the terrorist attacks that struck the London transit system. What were the suits thinking? <br/><br/>As a revenge fantasy, this movie works well enough, and there are some truly exciting passages. But how can audiences ignore the context of life today? How can we rally round a terrorist hero? Just the sort of well-meaning but soft-headed pop entertainment that can be appropriated by either fringe (if he were alive today, I'm sure Timothy McVeigh would give this movie four stars).<br/><br/>The heart of the movie is when Evey (Natalie Portman) is arrested and tortured and, consequently, becomes radicalized. This has plenty to say about our world today, especially counterproductive practices like extreme rendition. Terrorists are made, not born."
"michael.will","8","0","2","22 March 2006"," A tasty appetizer for a grand main course?
","""V for Vendetta"" is a sprawling urban fantasy that solidly entertains, despite puzzling the viewer in annoying ways that one can only hope will eventually prove to be strategic. A mega-budget adaptation, by the Wachowski brothers who gave us the ""Matrix"" franchise, of a series of graphic novels (which I've never read, I cheerfully admit to being a just-devirginized fan), it's more or less a hodgepodge of ""1984"" and any number of Euro-traditional super crook epics, from the early silent days, like ""Fantomas"", laid out in a cunningly abstruse manner. While it seems to be a self-contained narrative, chugging along in a haphazardly linear way to a grandly philosophical conclusion, any certainty that the story actually ends is undermined by lingering doubts over the reality of much of what's occurred. Nothing so hokey as ""it was all a hallucination"", but the viewer senses that maybe both his and the girl protagonist's perception of events has been toyed with, and there's plot elements all along the way to back this up. Couple these with the fates of several key characters, which we're only told about, and there's more than a whiff of a new franchise in the works especially if there's a big about-face over whom the real villain(s) of ongoing piece turns out to be.<br/><br/>Set in a totalitarian Britain of the not-too-distant future, the madly convoluted plot involves a quasi-heroic terrorist mastermind with super human fighting skills, bent on bringing down the oppressive police state. To this end V, the title avenger, serial murders various government bigwigs, hijacks the media to inspire civil disobedience, and demolishes grand old London landmarks. This penchant for historical vandalism, which he somehow justifies as nobly symbolic with oodles of strange rhetoric, is in tribute to his hero Guy Fawkes, the celebrated 17th century insurgent who tried to blow up the British parliament. V wears a plastic mask replica of Fawkes's face at all times, to cover up disfiguring burns he once suffered as a human guinea pig in government medical experiments, which put him on his path of vengeance. This, at least, is what he keeps telling Evie, the young working class heroine played by Natalie Portman, as an excuse to never unmask and, we're led to suspect, reveal his true identity. As she's recruited, kicking and screaming by increasingly diabolical methods, into V's deadly campaign of civil war mongering, neither she nor the viewer are ever quite sure why she's been chosen, even though flashbacks to her tragic childhood keep appearing in a somewhat explanatory fashion. As for the climactic suggestion of unrequited romantic love on V's part, a la ""Phantom of the Opera"", this has more the feel of a mere plot development than any corny attempt at tidying things up.<br/><br/>Still, assuming that this is indeed only the first chapter -- will number two be ""W for Something Else"", then so on with X and Y? -- it brilliantly camouflages the fact, by leaving the impression of being a thought-bombarding political allegory in the style of Truffaut's version of ""Fahrenheit 451"", way more concerned with the message it leaves behind than any big action pay-off, despite lots of good bloody fights along the way. Without giving away the aforementioned grand finale, there is so much speechifying that surrounds it, pertaining to the liberation and abiding strength of the human spirit, that one ponders how literally, rather than intellectually, the images on the screen are meant to be taken. I found myself thinking that what I was looking at was a bizarre and big scale rip-off of the 1985 depression era drama, ""Places in the Heart"" (of all things), with its tear-jerker church house ending that turns into a ghostly curtain call. Only later, when taking into account all those dangling plot threads, and just how morally questionable the ending actually is, did I say to myself, ""Now just a damn minute, here!"" Either I'd just watched something maddeningly vague and half-realized, or here was the groundwork for a true thinking person's super epic, which might combine the genres of science fiction action and political thriller in ways never seen before.<br/><br/>At any rate, ""V for Vendetta"" baffles and infuriates, but anything that can time release that much second guesswork, and demand to be quickly seen again just for what might've been overlooked, especially within that molasses-thick dialogue -- here's a film that's doing something right, in my books."

","Wow! I just saw V for Vendetta today, and it is a truly wonderful movie. I am not a studio flack, and actually no movie has ever inspired me to write a review on this site. That is until I saw V! I will say that there were at least three scenes that gave me goosebumps, because they were so visually striking. I watch a lot of movies, whether in the theater or movies I rent. There were scenes that I had never seen in any movie before. I will not ruin it for you, but the domino scene is a highlight, and I guarantee that you will be humming the 1812 Overture as you leave the theater. It is very timely, and you can easily see some parallels between the totalitarian Britain of the future and our own post 9/11 society. The acting is superb from Natalie Portman's excellent portrayal of Evey, to Hugo Weaving's having a blast with the mysterious V. The supporting cast is great, as well. I found it interesting to see John Hurt play the Big Brother like chancellor, as he played the Winston Smith role in the movie 1984 from the same year. It was interesting that I saw four movies this weekend that although from different years all had similar themes of not trusting government or people with authority. I watched The Handmaid's Tale, Terrance Malick's The Thin Red Line, The Constant Gardner, and of course V for Vendetta. All four were excellent in different ways, but I have to say that V was the best. As other reviewers have noted, you do not have to be familiar with the graphic novels in order to enjoy V for Vendetta, as I had never read any of them and enjoyed the movie immensely. I have read other reviews that said that the audience will have trouble rooting for a terrorist hero. However, the filmmakers address this by portraying V as a freedom fighter or revolutionary. No matter what your political leanings, you will enjoy this movie, and it is definitely worth checking out just for the visuals alone."

","I just saw V for Vendetta last night. I was quite anxious, i heard so much about it..the movie was totally up to my expectations. I was impressed of how much history, art, politics and literature there was in it. It was an exquisite mixture of so many great ideas of all times. The presence of Romanticism ( taking about the literary romanticism) was evident in the way V talked, in his love for The Count of Monte Cristo or Edmond Dantes-a revenging character by Dumas-a romantic writer, the one who wrote the 5 Mosqueteers- not surprisingly V wears a mask that associates to them. Don Kihot that V carries in his collection is also a romantic figure while the statue of Venus makes me think of classicism. Not to mention about the movies references to Nazism- they are pretty obvious.making V a Phantom of the Oprehah is quite essential in stressing the role of a hero, he has to be ruthless and unscrupulous,he cant be held back by emotions. the self conviction that there is no human sign is his appearance is what makes V the way he is. not showing his face makes it even more sublime. I am not quite sure if Natalie Portman would be of a great significance to the movie ( for as charming and talented as she may be) the movie wouldn't lack interest without her.Still she is a good pick for this movie.thats all i had to say"

","OK now i know i am as much as a noob as anybody else, but please everyone read the book. The book is so much better than the movie. V For Vendetta was created by Allan Moore and David Lloyd, Allan Moore had zero input on the movie. There is so much more to the movie that can only be felt in words on paper at this time. Allan Moore and David Lloyd are geniuses and it really saddens me that Allan Moore's creation has been changed so much. I read the novel about 2 weeks ago, knowing that the movie was coming out. I fell in love with not a person, but an idea. That's how i felt after reading that book. Of course I enjoyed the movie a lot but it might be due to my obsession, my friend read the book months ago and hated the movie ha so i guess its all about perspective. But Please ignore people who say you do not need to read the book because if this movie teaches you anything it is how spoiled and lazy we are. Too lazy to read a damn book, a great one i must say."
"wjohanb","7","0","2","20 March 2006"," Exhilarating if you let it be
","Most movies are a give and take proposition, meaning what you get out of it depends on the extent that you let yourself go into the films world. It's very rare that a film can force you to care. V for Vendetta is the most extreme example I've seen in a long time of a film that can either be tremendously exciting or as equally disappointing. At first I was nonplussed. The story seemed forced onto the screen, both in camera work and pacing. But about 30-40 minutes in I said ""F*@# IT""! to myself, and settled back to enjoy what was there. And dammit, I was downright exhilarated. For all it's faults, V for Vendetta manages to capture something unique in todays action flicks, and that's an actual soul. Alan Moore wrote the original book as a cry of outrage against Thatchers Britain, both the politicians and the passive populace, and where he feared they may be headed. Many people in America and all over the world hold the same sort of rage as they view the New Bush Regime. It's telling that the best, fiercest lines are taken verbatim from the book. Truth be told, V for Vendettas politics are simplistic unto silliness, and Moore himself has cut his name from the movie like it was a third nipple. But then again, Moore is a pompous, self righteous, difficult bastard, and V for Vendetta wasn't made to answer questions like, ""what's the difference between a terrorist and a freedom fighter""?, and ""when is violent protest the answer, if ever""? What the movie was made for, and does very well if you let it, is energize and galvanize, pump up your mind and body, stimulate your own questions. It helps that great actors like Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, and Stephen Fry are there to help you. Weaving especially does grand, forging a connection from V to the viewer without a single facial expression or ever seeing his eyes. The rabble rousing score is also damn good. V for Vendetta is an idea, not a foreign or domestic policy blueprint. And like any idea, it needs people to stand behind it for it to work. Oh yeah, does anybody actually read these f*#&ing things?"
"shriekingviolet","8","0","2","20 March 2006"," Great movie, but not as great as the graphic novel
","I just came back from seeing this movie and was pretty pleased with it, though, having just reread the graphic novel, it suffered through constant comparisons to the original to which it is inferior. There were a lot of changes, many of them I understood, like setting it further in the future since the original was set in the late 90s. I also didn't hold the removal of the sort of end of the cold war era mindset that the original seemed to be written in as it would have made the sentiment of the movie feel a little dated. I did miss, however, seeing more details of V's activities. He came as much more clever in the book, because you saw just how deep and who subtly he had managed to invade the government. I missed the side stories unveiling the deep madness and corruption inside the government. And I don't like how the cruelty of the government was softened (in the original, you saw more suppression of culture than in the movie) and how even V himself was softer. I think they were trying to make him more sympathetic to a wider audience, but I think in doing so they might have underestimated how moving V was in his original incarnation as well.<br/><br/>That all said, I felt the movie remained the sentiment of the original, which is what mattered. And had I not had the original so fresh in my memory, I probably wouldn't have spent much time picking it apart. But there were a few things I thought the movie improved upon. I was particularly tickled by the transformation of the old voice of Fate (in the book) into the voice of London, because Prothero was so wonderfully modeled off of many cable news host (particularly ones from Fox). That was a brilliant and fitting adaptation.<br/><br/>So yes, I'd recommend this movie. It's both exciting and thought provoking. But after you watch it, you should definitely pick up the graphic novel if you haven't read it already. Much deeper story, and I prefer the way it ended much better."

","OK, the movie was good, but not amazing. I have read the graphic novel and the movie does a decent job of telling the story. As far as the flaws of the movie they are as follows....V needed to be more ""unhinged"". In the graphic novel V was completely insane, he truly was the ""destroyer"", in the movie he was a bit toned down which hurt some of the impact of the story. Second, there were lines that were omitted from the film that would have been nothing to add that would have made the move that much better. I also really wish that we saw the whole computer/god thing that happened in the comic. The thing that really kills me in this movie is the ending...SPOILER ALERT...the movie should have stuck with the comic by making Evey don the mask of V rather than having the people of London wear the mask. The movie ending seemed a bit hokey.<br/><br/>So all in all, the movie is worth watching, but to truly understand the story read the comic, it is an amazing work of art and is masterfully written. So read the comic first then go see the movie, it is worth the time."
"sputnik7-1","7","0","2","20 March 2006"," An allegory and a mystery cleverly disguised as an ""action movie""
","Being a fan of the works of Alan Moore, I was pleasantly surprised that the spirit of his graphic novel was very much present in the big screen adaptation of 'V for Vendetta' (even though Mr. Moore's spirit was in absentia). Albeit tweaked to make the story more ""relevant"" by updating current events, 'V' was a very engaging polemic on civil liberties and our strange compliance to abandon them. Yes, yes, yes: the action scenes were well choreographed and intense, but if that's all what you want out of this film, go rent the first 'Matrix' film again. To be drawn into a fantasy world that echoes our own is the point of a good movie, but to appreciate 'V for Vendetta' one must have patience to arrive at that point of suspended belief. My major grievance with the movie is that parts of it felt rushed. The density of Alan Moore's books was conceived and collected over eight years in serialized comicbook form; it seemed director McTigue tried frantically to keep as much of the plot intact but at the same time having a frenetic style of editing which makes for confusing movie progression. Maybe this was the point of McTigue's muse, but the patience mentioned prior to enjoy this film was tested by this method of storytelling. All in all, 'V for Vendetta' was a smart and thoughtful movie. The acting was a bit twitchy, however. Natalie Portman as Evey was a trifle waifish and willowy, and Hugo Weaving as the swashbuckling ""terrorist"" V was both chewing scenery and chilling the air around him. The standout role in the film I believe was Stephen Rea's portrayal of Inspector Finch, the reluctant cop who patiently pursues V and over the course of the investigation stumbles onto more than just a so-called ""terrorist plot."" I won't give much more than that away, except that you don't see this dystopian London vision through V's eyes, or Evey's or even Alan Moore's; you slowly start to see it through Finch's (an enforcer of the status quo). That fact alone makes the film brilliantly executed. Overall, I'd give this movie a B+, and as it being McTigue's directorial debut, you must give him kudos for going big his first time out, even if there are moments it seems he bit off more that he could chew. Leave the rest of the chewing for Weaving and John Hurt."

","After much anticipation of this movie i found my self to be somewhat disappointed after i left the cinema. The movie itself was fantastic, one of the best i've seen in a long while, but as the book is one of my favourites i found myself constantly questioning decisions of the matrix bros.<br/><br/>granted they would be unable to convert the whole of the movie to film format, but the elements that were used could have been better, for example the start of the book takes place at the end of the film, and is replaced with a slightly less spectacular start. key elements such as finch going to lark hill and taking acid, then reliving the experience as an inmate were removed from the film, and for me these scenes were needed to truly show finches character. also the removal of fate, the computer that ran the country was a big loss, and changing the name of the head of the government also annoyed. Also the character of every was almost a different person to that in the book, she seems very bland and blasé toward v when she meets him in the film, but in the book she's amazed and full of wonderment at who he is and the things he does.<br/><br/>overall i was impressed but at the same time disappointed. if you've read the book, i would advise going just to see V come to life, if you haven't read it then go as it is amazing.<br/><br/>then again you can't have everything"
"jinxyhoodwink","7","0","2","19 March 2006"," Very entertaining and controversial, but at times blunt and meandering
","Let me start off, first of all, by saying that, on the whole, I enjoyed this film. It was unusual, it was firmly rooted in its dark comic-book origins. It made me think, debate, and had explosions! What more could you want? Weaving, in his harlequinesque Fawkes mask makes for an exciting and theatrical antihero whose dark motives we are constantly led to question. Natalie Portman's acting is actually rather good. Surprisingly, Weaving and Portman both execute a convincing English accent. This is no mean feat for either.<br/><br/>The choice of Weaving for the role of 'V' at first baffled me. I concluded that the choice was entirely in reference to his part in 'The Matrix' as Agent Smith (""It's the smelllllll.... I feel.... Saturated.... by it'). Weaving has clearly been chosen almost entirely for his fascinating voice; moribund and growly when put on in a slow manner. This is an important point since we never see his character's face, and his character relies to no small degree on the timbre of his words. And Weaving was the only actor I could think of whose English accent would carry with it no past associations and prejudices from other films.<br/><br/>John Hurt, on the other hand, seems to have been chosen entirely for his associations with '1984', and its depiction of a similar totalitarian Britain. This seems a little unsubtle. Close-up shots of his face and unmistakably bad lower teeth, however, convey the desired effect of a bastard uber-monarch, but this is hardly Hurt's finest hour.<br/><br/>There are many themes; freedom-of-speech questions, the topics of governmental oppression, the us-vs-them statements and the quandaries over what makes a terrorist a 'terrorist' as opposed to a freedom-fighter. Amongst these decent and engaging themes, though, there are a few problems with this as a film. Firstly, I question the taste of having a virtuous terrorist blow up the houses of parliament, when people in England are terrified that such an event might actually be plausible. Secondly, the film drags on a bit in the middle. To me as an English viewer, some of the scenes between the two midlands police officers in the police station played out like an ITV drama (amongst all the high-budget explosions). The English love to see high-budget, Hollywood explosions occurring on their poor, insignificant soil; as in Mission Impossible One. So why not stick a couple more big bangs in the middle to keep up the pace and keep us poor, buck-toothed Limeys happy?<br/><br/>And this brings up another, less subtle point. Once we have acknowledged that this film is good specifically for its moral ambiguity, it is, at time, rather blunt. At points I felt like I was being bludgeoned over the head with some of its moral and political opinions. I'm a liberal, and yet even I found its tone a little too evidently the creation of left-wing writers at times. This is perhaps the cause of the raft of rather strange right-wing comments that have come out about this film 'glorifying terrorism'. One chap (a holocaust denier, as it turns out), thought it was perfectly emblematic that Stephen Fry kept a copy of the Qu'ran in his cellar alongside his gay porn. Both artefacts are, apparently, evidence of his degeneracy.<br/><br/>On the whole, a good film. 'V for Vendetta' is an engaging and thought-provoking ,politically topical comic book adventure, and in this vein lacks subtly in its opinions. It would have been a near-perfect film however, had the creators balanced its intelligent execution with a little low-brow action to keep us a little more entertained."

","Simply because of all the hype and the proposed pro-terrorist agenda surrounding its big screen debut, but dammit it's a good movie. Maybe not AMAZING as some people have been bold enough to say, but it is an an entertaining and fun script and the action is wired up correctly. I usually don't lean towards movies that push political agendas, especially far left or far right ones, but this movie is about revolution. Yes, parliament is blown up, and yes the big ben clock tower is not spared, but these actions lead to a revolt by the people.....all of them, not just a small party with destruction at hand. Once all the people stand up and revolt against a government to overthrow it, it is considered a revolution and it is how America was founded. So before you judge this movie as a promotion for terrorism, watch it for yourself and make up your own mind. As for the acting, it was about what I expected....not great but certainly exceptional. I know nothing about the comic so I cannot comment on it faithfulness, but I hear it's not a very faithful adaptation so comic lovers beware. The action is up to par, even though sometimes it's a little unbelievable and the enemies of V stand still on occasion and just let him pulverize through them. The dark, gritty setting was nice and about what I expected coming in to see it. The ideas were a little far fetched, and America bashing does take place in it from time to time. The sound was very good though, and should be noted to be a good big screen quality. The directing was about average for these types of movies. The violence is not as strong as some may have predicted. Overall this is a good movie with a damn good screenplay and you should check it out for a good time."

","All you looking for a date flick, this isn't the one. All you looking for some laughs - there's a couple. All you looking for a film that will make you question things - did you make your choice on the pill - see it. It is dark, political, and its quite a ride. You will be surprised to find more dialogs than action. But this should not discourage you - there is a good story, and it points out some very real things! I have seen it with a friend who said - ""it was too much"". Honestly, for me it was not ""quite enough"". And thats why I give it a 9 out of 10. But isn't it right next to perfect??...<br/><br/>V for Very Good Film!"

","The Wachowski Bros. are talented, and the Matrix was a great film. But I found this to be far supirrior. It was true to its original subject matter, the acting was top notch, special effects top notch, the story: interesting, emotionally gripping, and downright perfect!<br/><br/>The film made so many great points about government and war and other political problems that are nothing more than bad things to our society, and the heroes, the people who see behind the lies of the media and politics and fight back by sending a true message to the people: that's what V For Vendetta is about.<br/><br/>There really ins't a whole lot that I can honestly say about the film except I love, I love, I Fukin' love the film. In my humble opinion, this movie is one of the top 10 films to come out in the last 10 years! It is up there with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Sin City in my book! This film deserves to be on the IMDb top 250 and to win an Oscar and be one of the top grossers of the yeah hands Down!"

The movie doesn't really look as if its going to have too much depth. But... I was still very interested in seeing what it had to offer. I must say after watching the film, that it is one of the best movies I've had the pleasure of viewing in a while (and I watch A lot of movies!) <br/><br/>For those going into the movie just expecting 2 and a half hours of matrix fighting you will be disappointed. While the fight scenes are very enjoyable, they are few and far between. So come expecting a more intellectual and political film. This movie is really an eye opener and very relevant to the situations that humanity has gotten it self in to in present day. I highly recommend you spend the 10 bucks, and go see this one while its in theaters."

","V got robbed.<br/><br/>Vendetta was a good movie that was robbed of a chance to be seen by so many more people. V's R rating for reasons i don't know (yes there is some unneeded violence in some scenes that simply stole from the story line and the ""F"" word 1 time the whole movie) but still the movie wasn't near enough to be considered unsuitable for people under 17 in the states (maybe the intense political aspect of it made it a R movie or maybe the terrorism). But yes back to the movie. V was a political drama that makes you ask the question ""Could this happen one day, wait it is happening!"". So many people are misunderstanding the movie for a ""Story about terrorism"" and not calling it a look into a quite possible future, with which only one man is brave enough to fight the oppression brought on by a manipulative government. If some parts of V make you angry then AWESOME because thats the point. Natalie Portman is amazing with a bald head, but her British accent isn't so sharp. so scenes are cheesy (maybe on purpose) The voice of V fits the character awesome, and the visuals rock. Pay close attention to the story and don't be narrow minded. V rocks 8/10"
"cultfilmfan","7","0","3","18 March 2006"," V For Vendetta
","V For Vendetta is based upon the graphic novel by Alan Moore. The film is set in Britain in the future and is about a young woman named Evey who is saved on the streets from a mysterious man in a cape and mask who calls himself V. V stands up for the evil government and leader who is trying to take over. V fights against the evil members of the government and takes Evey under his care to show her his ways and to teach her about what he stands for. V For Vendetta has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by the entire cast (especially Natalie Portman who plays Evey), good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction and good set decoration. The film took a little while for me to get into it and at times throughout the film there were things I found complicated and didn't totally understand, but overall I liked this movie. It's a good looking and stylish film and it has a very original plot and ideas. The film is entertaining and eventually starting to draw me into the film more and more. The film is classy and stylish and has lots of great atmosphere and some good action sequences that feel like this is almost a comic book come to life. The past few years there have been many good films based on comics and graphic novels such as Sin City or Batman Begins and this film looks and feels like a comic book and the people who made this movie made it right and the film is a great visual accomplishment and is very entertaining as well. An original and compelling film that should appeal to action and science fiction fans of all kinds."

This movie has all the action but its also moving, thought-provoking, wonderfully acted, and well lets just say absolutely brilliant and get it over with. The famous screen writers obviously had a vision and what you see on the surface portrays that vision well. However, just as with the Matrix and its subtle references to Jesus, if you pay close attention there are many underlying messages that make this movie really special for buffs like me. I am sure somewhere on the Internet there is, or will be, a web site that will point them all out. To mention them in detail would mean including spoilers here and anyway its worth digging for the gold.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's performance was a real eye opener for me anyway. There is about a ten minute stretch after she receives her famous hair cut where I was moved to tears and the only other thing that does that to me is a red hot poker in the eye."

"ExpendableMan","9","0","3","18 March 2006"," And the frozen mask just smiles
","How do you go about adapting one of the greatest comic books in history without alienating the long time fans who've worshipped the pages it's printed on since day one? This is a question that has to have troubled Hollywood execs a lot given the number of comic-to-movie conversions in the past few years, but the pressure must have really been on for the Wachowskis when making V For Vendetta. The original graphic novel is an adult oriented title about a masked madman terrorising a futuristic fascist England written during the Thatcher era and as such is bristling with political vitriol and a twisty-turny plot packed with intricate detail, lovingly crafted with such passion it has become one of the industry's most hallowed titles. Thus, it is a tremendous relief to say that after the disaster of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and the ""I can't believe this is based on the comic"" misfire of From Hell that writer Alan Moore has finally had a work translated perfectly to the screen, even if he did insist on having his name removed from the credits.<br/><br/>But then, V is a million miles away from the likes of The Punisher or Spiderman. The comic existed for one run only and had a very concise story to tell, rather than having numerous incarnations and interpretations of the same character, so the move from page to screen would be slightly easier to make as the boundaries are more clearly marked. However, if it had been an exact re-interpretation, the movie would have been about nine hours long, full of slow moving conversational scenes and rather painful to sit through (what makes a good comic does not always make a good film), but the end result is near perfect in its execution.<br/><br/>The Wachowskis you see are not afraid to hold back the venom. Their futuristic England is a nightmarish dystopia that seems unbearably close as families gather round comfortable middle class homes to watch the latest propaganda spin, ministers spouting hate-fuelled rants about the evils of foreign nations, terrorists, free-thinkers and homosexuals in the name of safe-guarding the public. Kudos to them too for having the sheer audacity to continue making the film in the wake of the July 7th Tube bombings which has major resonations in the plot; the scenes of the enigmatic vigilante tearing London apart with explosives worryingly near to home.<br/><br/>And yet, despite witnessing this lunatic blasting our capital to smouldering ruins, V is an electrifying focal point. His face is never shown and while his highly intelligent rants are always tinged with madness, he remains a captivating anti-hero. After all, can he really be considered an 'evil' terrorist when the regime he is fighting is corrupt, paranoid and willing to lie repeatedly merely to cover their own tracks? Yes, he murders his enemies, but as his story unfolds it's hard not to feel some sympathy for him.<br/><br/>Not that V for Vendetta is all heavy-handed politics and debates on the blurring boundaries between hero and villain. While the likes of Munich and Syriana tackle the current world state with gritty realism, V for Vendetta is considerably more vaudevillian. One slow motion knife fight near the climax is jaw dropping and scenes like Natalie Portman's baptism in the torrent of rain plunging from the sky become increasingly melodramatic as the running time ticks by. But then, this is a film more likely to reach a mainstream audience than Syriana and the integration of damning cultural criticism and theatrics-ridden entertainment is expertly accomplished.<br/><br/>Sure, quite a lot of the comic book is left out. The internal party rivalries are abandoned almost entirely, many of the supporting characters don't appear at all and the ending is slightly different, but the differences between the two mediums are not so great as to distance them entirely. And fans of the original wondering about the torture scenes need not fear, they are included in near identical shot-for-shot translation. This was an excellent film, tremendous entertainment and intelligent to boot; my friends and I lasted a mere four minutes after the end credits before having a political discussion. For now, Alan Moore can sleep safely."

","although this movie did take a little while to get going, anyone who gives it time to unfold will find a truly thought-provoking, surprisingly engaging film in this era of disposable entertainment. without going into to much detail, this movie follows the exploits of V, a masked revolutionary (what others call a terrorist) who seeks to start a fire of change for the totalitarian regime his homeland has fallen under, and Evey (or was it Ebbe? dang British accents). This movie is highly political, and i emphasize HIGHLY. While some may find this distracting, we can only hope that most will actually take time to analyze what the movie suggests. Do the ends justify the means? Is terrorism really terrorism if you are doing it for a good cause? Is terrorism against the state really terrorism if you have the support of the the people whom the state controls? I've said terrorism a lot, but this movie does not glorify terrorism, it promotes pro-active involvement in one's government so that power doesn't fall solely into the hands of a few individuals. The messages found in this movie could be no more relevant in any part of history than now. If you're looking for an amazingly deep movie, full of anger, and comedy, and thought, and action, then see V for Vendetta. If thinking and caring about how your government controls your daily life without you knowing doesn't concern you, then go see that new Rob Schnieder movie - it's guaranteed to be 90 minutes of thoughtless, pointless, vacuous cinema."
"brentybuddy101","9","0","5","18 March 2006"," The Wachowski Brothers know their stuff
","V is a revolutionary idea more than he is an actual person. The fact that he wears a mask gives him a unique identity among everyone else, and shows that his idea is worthy of character. The Wachowski brothers, having written the screenplay, and their personification of revolution through one man, give this movie the beauty it deserves. If it had been written by anyone else, the film would not have been close to being as good as it is. Also, be proud that the director didn't incorporate any cheesy attempts-to-be-impressive Matrix-like effects, especially since they weren't needed at all. <br/><br/>Although I doubt this film will be a commercial success (like with The Matrix and their action figures -_-), it will definitely live on as a cult classic."
"MovieZoo","8","0","4","18 March 2006"," On a scale of I to V, V gets a V
","I liked this movie a lot! The creators were not afraid to go against the grain. They made a movie unafraid of the status-quo movie makers, unafraid of the critics and unafraid of the viewer. The main character, V, was as mysteriously charming and psychotic as I had hoped for. At least for the most part. It is not that the man wanted to be that way, because who knows what he might have become had he not been brutalized by a self-serving government. Don't let that description deter you from seeing this movie. The main character was not much stranger than the way this movie was delivered. This is the type of finished product that will be remembered for a long time. The offbeat introduction to the less important characters was as strange as V, himself. Comic relief is handled better in this movie than any other ""graphic novel"" movie that I have seen. The story is very well done. The imagery was excellent. And you just have to love how Hugo Weaving made the mask come alive though it was nothing more than a stiff, lifeless, representation of life lost - a work of art in its own right.<br/><br/>There was a time when I began to sense a slight bit of the British TV show ""The Prisoner"" and even some British comedy but it only added to the mysterious beauty of this movie. The creators succeeded in making this movie play out like someone reading a graphic novel to you, pointing out the pictures from time to time.<br/><br/>I found myself relating more to Natalie Portman's character than to V. And I think most people will. V is too unique and only an original personality can even begin to relate but he can easily be loved while feared simultaneously. Don't pay attention to those who fear you will see this movie and will want to become a terrorist. Also, DO NOT pay attention to those who want you to believe this is political. Politics is essential but a small part of this movie. The biggest part of the story is the personalities. People who want to turn this into a vehicle to tout their hatred for political figures are totally missing the mark. They, themselves, are the problem - not the movie. It IS a M-O-V-I-E!<br/><br/>8 out of 10 because I loved it, would have ended it differently and because I think some parts were cut or changed to protect the innocent. I am counting on the DVD to put it all back together."

","Got to say, I absolutely loved this film. It was such an emotional, thrilling and fully fleshed out and rich film that I just couldn't control myself. I cried I loved it so much, and the ending and the sorrow in V's character is so palpable by the end, it drove me to tears. The action was insane as well, although not as rampant as in ""The Matrix"", this film chose it's action sequences well, especially the bloody finale, which gives a new meaning to the statement, ""Blood Soaked Cinema"". The acting was fantastic, with the supporting characters shining just as much as the main ones. Stand out stuff. The visual effects were really good as well. I only have one thing left to talk about, which I am slightly confused about...there is a spoiler so read with caution<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT!!!!! SERIOUS SPOILER ALERT!!! okay, Iwalked out of the theater slightly confused about one thing and only this one thing. V is a woman who is transformed into a man through experimentation? Am I right? I think I am. Even the name, V, is the ultimate letter, symbol for femininity, and V's collection of antiques and relics, not to mention V's fashion spoke of a woman, or a trans-gender. The reveal on this is that the doctor whom V kills, the autopsy woman, worked in the womens section of the hospital. Totally a woman, I know it! Is this in the comic?"
"nobles-4","9","0","5","17 March 2006"," I couldn't stand this amazing movie.
","I hated it and thought is was the best damn movie I've seen in a while at the same time. Let me explain. You see, the movie was very well done. The acting was great, the story was intriguing, the characters were well developed, and the overall theme of the movie rang true to the book. However, they took far too many liberties. Far more than were necessary. The rest of my review will be in spoiler tags. While the overall plot was the same, the difference was in the details. Evey was not a prostitute at the beginning. Not a big deal, and that part didn't bother me. However, V did not take Evey to the shadow gallery after their first meeting. He let her go, and she returned to her job at the BNC, which they added. Then, they had the V taking over the news station seen much earlier than in the comic. That bothered me a bit, but what bothered me the most was how the handled the scene. They butchered V's speech. Gone was the theatricality of him playing the part of God, having a meeting with humanity in his office to tell humanity that they were to be fired from the corporation that is life do to the political and social disasters over the course of human history. The speech in it's place, while very well written, was still quite inferior. And unnecessary. The original speech was perfect the way it was, and there was no reason to alter it that I can see. Many other changes were made as well. Rose, the wife of the fingerman V killed who V manipulated into becoming the Chancelor's assassin, was gone. I personally found the way the Chancelor was killed in the comic to be far better than the way he was killed in the movie. The also completely omitted the bits told from the Chancelor's perspective. While not a necessary piece of the story, they gave a good deal of insight into the psychology of a fascist dictator and the inherent madness of one. If it had remained, it would have given an extra layer of depth to the film and would have made the Chancelor more than a two dimensional villain. The fight scene at the end of the film, while very well done, was not in the comic and was quite unnecessary. V was killed by Finch in the comic book, and while the scene was not as exiting, it was just as deep and emotionally gripping, if not more so. Also, they severely cut short Finch's visit to Larkhill. In the comic, Finch went there and took some LSD, to try to understand V's obviously warped psyche. What followed was a rather bad trip on Finch's part that gave some insight into the mind of a person who's in fear of his government, and what they'll do to survive, even if that involves completely ignoring their personal moral code. In the movie, however, the trip was completely omitted. They also changed the reason that England went fascist. Instead of a result of the chaos that ensued due to a war between the world's super powers, it was changed to a conspiracy by the part itself to create chaos. Most of the changes, to me, seemed completely unnecessary, and I wonder why they chose to do them in the first place. The part that they kept completely the same (with the exceptions of one or two lines) was the scene where Evey was in the jail cell, reading the letter from the woman in room four. That was one of my favorite parts of the book, so I was glad to see they kept it. All in all, it was a great film. However, if they had been closer to the book, it would have been extraordinary."

I never read the comic book before, and I only knew briefly about the characters and the background of the story before watching it ... and I came out really impressed by it! There were a few minor cut-off scenes (Singapore's version is cut :C ) that I experienced, but nothing too major to make a change in the overall story. Really great story telling here, it kept me on my seat all the way, even if the crowd did feel there parts that went on bait slow ... but I enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>Eveybody's acting was great, I enjoyed how Hugo Weaving acted out as V. Under a mask, he managed to make you feel how his character should be ... it's almost as if his mask could change to the right expression, yet it's always the same look ... he really did a good job with his role. Not to be outdone was Natalie Portman's acting ... she really did a great job in this movie, just loved the way she showed fear in her body language, whether she was a prisoner or being hunted down by the police ... great job on her part.<br/><br/>As for the action sequence, I'm thankful it was not overdone at all. I enjoyed the way the sequences are played out, the main focus is not so much on the violence, but anyone would tell you ... it's the storyline and the views that matter more in this movie. You want an action flick? This film isn't that mindless, go watch something else. It would take some intelligence to appreciate beyond the general summary that everyone knows.<br/><br/>I'll recommend it ... i'm not the least disappointed ... it would really be perfect if it was really released on the 5th of November!"
