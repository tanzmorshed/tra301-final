"firefox-CWN","8","10","11","1 November 2001"," A very bold attempt for a modern open-wheel racing movie
","I love CART racing. I love any form of auto racing. When I first heard that Sly Stallone set production the first auto racing movie of the 21th. century I rose in excitement. I was even lucky enough to be at the Toronto Indy to watch portions of the filming as Champ car replicas roared out of the paddock. Watching this movie, I was treated to some fantastic special effects that were taken to level very close to the 1966 classic Grand Prix. Unfortunately, details of Driven's plot resembled Grand Prix too closely for this movie to be considered a creative attempt. Jimmy Bly(Kip Purdue) and Beau Brandenburg(Til Schweiger) both provided very respectable roles as co-stars alongside Sylvester Stallone playing the aging veteran driver Joe Tanto. The characters were developed enough through the film to understand their unique personalities. I was deeply impressed with how Driven displayed the drivers as understandable of their competitors and respected each other on the race track. I hate how some racing movies turn racing into a reckless grudge match. One of the worst elements in this movie is that only three drivers with the exception to happy go lucky teammate Memo Heguy (Who ran in place of Tanto for races) were shown within a twenty-plus driver field. Actual indy-style open-wheel racing is often much more competitive than shown in Driven. This movie shortfall was probably left over from the Formula One script that Stallone started with. All and all, Driven has weaknesses when comparing it as a great racing movie. But, it was a very suitable movie for family entertainment."
"VengefulSquirrel","Null","44","64","15 July 2004"," Eyes for sale... I no longer want them, they feel soiled now.
","Hey, I didn't watch the film deliberately. I live in a house with two batteries and one of them wasn't in the remote and if I ever find the sod I'm justing going to dispose of it in a fire regardless of what the instructions say.<br/><br/>You know how in real races they sought through the mangled wreckage in search of the remaining bits of the driver after a crash? That's what it's like trying to find a film amongst the last two hours of my life... except in that this case if I find anything still moving I'm going to hit it with a shovel. <br/><br/>I've experienced pain in my life, I've experienced head injuries, and oddly I suspect that those involved in making this film have too. The only difference is I let my pain out in a long girlish shrieks and they decide to bottle it up and then inflict it on others. <br/><br/>Here is the plot *SPOILER* <br/><br/>Things go in circles.<br/><br/>Not the cars, the plot. Well, the cars might have done but there were so many random changes of camera angle that I was too busy having a seizure and staining the carpet with my froth.<br/><br/>So basically the plot is goes as follows: Seizure, despair, seizure, disbelief at plot, seizure, why has that man got a very odd shaped head, seizure, someone almost does something of a social nature, seizure, the first hour of the movie turns out to have no relevance to the first hour, seizure, cars driving down street in a hilariously homoerotic display of gurning and head wobbling, seizure, begging for death, seizure, uncontrollable laughter at quite possibly the most crack-inspired moment in film history, at which point I was too busy crying to have any further seizures.<br/><br/>I should have stopped watching when my hand subconsciously began crawling towards the jumbo bottle of sleeping pills, yet I became strangely fixated by the horror...much like when you see a crazed but very small dog attacking a pensioner. <br/><br/>The level of testosterone displayed in this film makes Top Gun look like The Muppets Take Manhattan. Eventually I cringed so much that when they loudly announced they were going to ""double-team the field"" I slipped a disc. Women are allowed to do two things in the movie, stand there, and bend over. On a side note, neither of the two main ones seem able to do this well for the five seconds of screen time they have before it gets back to the seizures and I suddenly realize I have a shotgun barrel in my mouth and my toe's heading for the trigger.<br/><br/>I'd like to comment more on the plot but after a while I started drawing a more interesting film on my eyeballs with a pencil. Mine had Godzilla ripping Stallone in half, their film had some car doing something. Mine is better. Just trust me."
"senninha70","1","74","114","26 July 2002"," Man, I wanted this movie to be good...
","As a big auto racing fan, CART in particular, I awaited this movie since the mid-90's when it was discussed as a Formula One movie.  However, Formula One wouldn't allow the access that it did for Grand Prix in 1966, so the director defaulted to the North American CART series.  CART allowed unprecedented access to its venues, races, paddock, announcers, drivers, sponsors, etc.  But this movie fails in that it is nothing more than an auto racing clich√©.  As a fan, it's hard to rebuff the blood sport aspect of the sport to those who are not fans.  The crashes are incredibly unrealistic, some of the tracks are non-existent and the drivers are paper thin.  The scene near the swimming pool with the blonde vixen doing some sort of goofy water aerobics is pathetic.  The part where Jimmy Bly steals a car (that happens to be filled with fuel indoors and doesn't need an external starter to run) and drives it through the Chicago streets with Stalone in tow is just ridiculous.  And to they get arrested or even prosecuted for this action?  No, they just are forced to convey one of the stupidest dialogues in the history of racing movies.<br/><br/>The CART series is in serious trouble in real life.  A movie about the excitement of the series, the strategy, the action and the pageantry of racing could have boosted the series back to national respectability. However, this movie just hinders its descent into oblivion with the Can-Am series.  It could have been so much more."
"mba","Null","10","12","29 January 2002"," Entertaining and easy to watch, took itself a little too seriously though
","All i've got to say is that i enjoyed this movie and found it entertaining and an interesting insight into the competition between race drivers and what they go through in a demanding profession. I do wish Estella Warren had more to do in this film, because she is just LUSH! and one of my favourite models.  But it seems as though she has just been put in the film for the eye-candy, which is great but she needs to do more because she deserves a better chance to really make it as an actress. But overall it is quite entertaining with the racing scenes and the variety of locations they go to. Maybe it would've been better if it took itself less seriously. A masterpiece it aint, but better than i expected and easy to watch. I say to all the people who are trashing this film, you are entitled to your opinion and so am i. My opinion is that you are a bunch of SNOBS!! Admit it, you are!<br/><br/>Rating- 8 out of 10"
"IonMech","10","8","10","27 April 2001"," Who would have thought this movie would be SO good?
","I watched the new and read the papers and began to expect an OK, fast-paced movie that would still be fun but not a good movie. I would now like to completely disagree with every critic who gave a poor rating to this movie. There were times in the movie where I got angry at something happening but then very shortly afterwards the problem that kind of annoyed me was solved perfectly and made the movie continue to flow. The weird thing about the movie is how there are about 4 main characters, all in the movie about an equal amount of time and all equally heroic and fun to watch. And even at the point where you think they're just going to screw up the whole movie something happens to smooth out the bumps. And next not only was the songs for the movie integrated really well into what was happening, but all the songs kicked! The first thing I am going to do tomorrow is go out and buy the soundtrack. I would write more but I'd probably take up another 5 paragraphs explaining how perfectly the movie worked out its problems and everything you wanted to happen or something even better than what you wanted to happen does! This movie was incredible! 10 out of 10!"
"Rob_Taylor","4","50","86","16 July 2004"," Driven.......to distraction
","It's hard to know where to begin to review this movie. At first glance it's harmless enough, but there was a lot about it that annoyed me. So rather than waste a lot of time analysing the merits (or lack thereof) of this film I'll be flippant with the following comments:<br/><br/>Things this movie taught me:<br/><br/>1. Young race car drivers are, apparently, so immature as to think that a couple of drinks with a pretty girl means that she wants to have their babies and are willing to get into fisticuffs to protect their (entirely imagined) relationship.<br/><br/>2. If a driver is injured he doesn't need to see a trained physician to certify him race fit. All he needs to do is hop up and down on a busted ankle for the gratification of his sado-masochistic, wheelchair-bound boss.<br/><br/>3. If you're a naughty race-car driver you can drive your 200mph, non-street legal Indycar on public highways and the only consequence of this life-endangering stunt will be a small fine.<br/><br/>4. It is also perfectly acceptable to spin your race car 180 degrees and drive the wrong way around the race track, endangering other drivers, so long as you're doing it to save a friend from a horrible (but well deserved) flaming death.<br/><br/>5. Wives, girlfriends and brothers of race drivers (or just about anyone who knows them) can not only stand in the team control booth in a self-important manner, but also give orders to the drivers as if they were the team boss.<br/><br/>6. Tyres that come off cars in accidents can fly hundreds of feet into the air, go over the safety fence, and fall amongst the crowd. But don't worry. So long as you aren't hit when it lands you are safe. Rubber tyres apparently don't bounce at all when hitting concrete bleachers.<br/><br/>All in all then, this movie is less than impressive. On a scale of 1 to rancid this film gets a solid 4 and a half lard blocks (most of the lard was on Burt Reynolds - will he never give up?)<br/><br/>Not worth the effort."
"moonlightreflections","8","49","85","16 May 2001"," Not necessarily an arthouse masterpiece, yet nowhere as bad as its rep.
","It's been often mentioned by other reviewers that the art of the cornball must have been engineered by Sylvester Stallone;  it's just as often forgotten that true tripe goes unwatched merely because it does not go into wide, national release.  So guess which movies always receive the worse rep?<br/><br/>Having watched the trailer and anticipated this movie for a while, I knew exactly what to expect beforehand: your typical good guy vs. bad guy, fight for glory, 'win-all-lose-all final confrontation' fare.  Surprisingly, I encountered something that attempted to be a little more profound, and while it doesn't exactly hint at the meaning of existence, it explores a facet of human relationships which not many other movies in this genre have touched. The movie's tagline, ""Welcome to the human race,"" does a nice job of encompassing all that this film discusses.<br/><br/>The peculiar thing about the entire setup is that, unlike all other movies in this genre, there are no defined lines.  There is no good guy, no bad guy;  simply a race for perfection that alludes to the way that most of us wish to live, though the path that we take is an altogether different matter.  It's difficult to pick up on, but if enough attention is paid, the idiosyncrasies of each of the characters in this movie speak far more than what their dialogue brings to the table.<br/><br/>Where the film falters, and causes most of the audience to misperceive its message, is in its presentation.  It's frenetic, loud, and highly distracting;  and yet, tremendously appealing to this particular viewer. The speed with which the director cuts between shots, pans, zooms, spins, spirals, etc., go hand in hand with the feel of the sport in general, and is indeed very creative -- but it is hard to keep up with what's going on.  How are we supposed to know what each character is feeling when the scene cuts away before the dialogue is even finished?  How are we supposed to be even able to recognize what's happening on the screen when we're not given more than a two-second break between blaringly obtrusive rock songs?  Once again, the movie alludes to the sport itself with the commercialization of its soundtrack.  And while highly kinetic, and emotionally involving at times (the opening scene with the media was brilliantly executed for a Jimmy Bly point of view), it's just hard to...keep track of everything.<br/><br/>But in the end, the main reason anybody is going to watch this movie for is the racing, particularly the accidents that take place at excesses of 200 miles per hour.  And it delivers pretty admirably, truth be told.  There are a lot of interesting camera positions and perspectives to make you feel a part of the race, and the special effects could be considered top-notch. Kudos to whoever decided to not give the CG cars and items the cheap, laughter-inducing fluidity of movement that's to be found in just about any other movie with computer graphics (though there were a few scenes with this effect).  It's not necessarily realistic, and a little simplistic on the artistic scale, but it reaches a satisfying level of subtlety--and at times, it's fascinating to see some of the things that can be done.<br/><br/>The film is not without its clich√©s, it sometimes forgets about or fails to discuss a few of its plot points, and the women appear to be portrayed a little 2-dimensionally.  But when the crew is watching the race or practice runs from the movie's dramatic camera angles on their small overhead monitor, you simply don't care.  The movie takes itself seriously, but it's also intended to be fun;  it's merely up to the viewer to interpret how they wish to take it.  The first time, it may be a little difficult to swallow, but with subsequent bites, you begin to grow accustomed and appreciate its distinct flavor.<br/><br/>Here's hoping that Stallone sticks to it for a while longer.  I'm hungry for more.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Recent Car Flicks have been deadly dull affairs.both Gone in 60 Seconds and The Fast and the Furious bored me so i had little hope for this.However i like Renny Harlin as a Action Director and this is really quite good.Suprisingly this is not a one star show.Though thanks to the Pathetic Warner DVD UK Release you could be forgiven for thinking this wasnt a Stallone Picture But An Estelle Warren movie.Shame on Warner for that.The Action Scenes are great,yes theres CGI but what recent movies are not?Yes its total Fantasy,But thats Fiction.Fun.7 out of 10"
"PatrynXX","7","5","6","5 November 2001"," Fun to watch. If your a race fan that is.
","(spoilers?)<br/><br/>I see good points and bad points in this movie.  First the bad.  Outsiders and people who don't know much about Formula One racing and their ilk might not get the lingo. (Trust me, I consider myself an outsider but know enough about racing to get drawn into the movie.)  Outsiders probably will shun this movie and shut it off before it hits the end of the movie.  It'll totally bounce off their brains.  Probably why this movie got so poor movie reviews is because critics aren't racing fans.  It has the edge, but perhaps it's that edge they don't like.<br/><br/>Second, Gina Gershon (sp?) for some reason wasn't made for this role.  She just totally sucked in it.  She's been great in other movies like Bound and especially The Insider.  But she's too snobby for her own good in this movie.  She doesn't play the part of an a**hole very well.  Sure she was an a**hole in The Insider but for some reason she pulled it off there.<br/><br/>Third, some of the car accidents looked a tad overdone.  <br/><br/>
Now for the good.  The dvd is totally rad.  51 minutes of deleted scene's. With Stallone commenting.  Who the hell can top that?  This is a speed movie it'll catch you if your into that type of thing.<br/><br/>Recognizing actors in here was fun to.  Including the youngsters brother. Knew him straightway from Dead Poets Society.  The enemy (for awhile  :) played a Replacement Killer in The Replacement Killers. The actress who played Sophie looks alot like Jennifer Connelly.  Not kidding.  You compare them and you'd swear they were twins. :)  Not that that's a bad thing.<br/><br/>In the end, I like this movie enough to buy it.  (haven't yet, but wait a few months and we'll see).  Like I said before though...outsiders beware... racing might not be up to your stuff.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Quality: 6/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Replayable: 9/10"
"richeryv","8","9","13","4 February 2002"," for eyes and ears
","(some spoilers) I missed the flick in the theatres due to bad and unfair reviews so I rented it at the local videostore last week. I expected it to be a F1 movie but the story takes place in the CART milieu instead. As a big F1 fan I was a bit disappointed but it turned out to be a very pleasant and impressive movie with breathtaking race scenes, creative camera angles and stunning special effects. Eventhough the race and crash scenes were not realistic it's still very funny to watch (in a scene Memo's car goes airborne spinning through the air for half minute before crashing into a lake!). In a real race Sly would have received a time penalty or even a black flag for his blocking on Brandenburg in his first race and another one in his desperate attempt to overtake him in the final one. Moreover, due to the crashes the races would have been stopped several times. I was also very surprised that there were no safety cars in the entire movie¬Ö But who cares ? If you want to see a normal race turn on the tv on sundays ! Remember it's an action film and its purpose is to entertain. Here you get action, fun, a good score, nice girls¬Ö and a thrilling chase sequence through the streets of Chicago(!). I really do think that Renny Harlin and Stallone have done a great job and I'm looking forward to watching the sequel ! 8/10 stars PS : It seems that Burt Reynolds underwent some plastic surgery or something.Weird."
"fdan75","10","6","8","28 April 2001"," Very good film
","I was not giving too much credit about this movie in the beginning but after it I was very surprised. It was different since it took the the driver's point of view, all the pressure and so on. Also Sly was great and just showed a very equal point of view from both pilots.<br/><br/>Eventhough the main background is Indy, Formula One fans can identify easy the major stars like Shumacher performed by Brandeburg ( even the red suit from Ferrari, same hair style and same attitude) also Frank Williams is found by the team director on a wheel chair. The Brazilian driver ( that is performed by a Chilean actor with a strong accent when he says thanks) also had a booklet on Ayrton Senna another F1 driver.<br/><br/>Anyway for those who like a good race it is highly recommended. The soundtrack is very good too and Stallone definetly did a good job!"
"firearms trainer","Null","36","70","26 August 2001"," This has to be the WORST movie ever written!
","This movie was so bad that the producers owe us another movie just to bring the rating up to zero. It is an insulting slap in the face to every race fan who ever lived and I would suggest that viewers immediately initiate a class action lawsuit to recover the money they wasted on this picture and compensation for the time spent watching it. The ONLY technical aspect of racing that they got right was the fact that the cars, at least SOME of the time, had four wheels. Otherwise, it was obvious that the writer knew absolutely nothing about motor racing. I would suggest that Sylvester Stallone should have at least watched an Indy car race before he wrote this piece of junk. <br/><br/>The computer-generated images were so bad that they probably set back the acceptance of CGI in movies another 50 years. The acting was about as real as the cartoon-like car crashes and all the actual Indy car drivers should have had their agents collectively sue to have their names replaced in the credits by ""Allan Smithee.""<br/><br/>I would watch this movie again only if forced to, and only for the pleasure of walking out of it and demanding my money back again."
"silverleto","8","7","10","1 June 2009"," I love this movie.
","If you're a die-hard racing fan or like to pick apart movies for fun, this movie is not for you. However, if you like movies for sheer entertainment, great soundtracks, and a deeper look at relationships in general, this one is brilliant.<br/><br/>Taken at more than face value, the screenplay is brilliantly written. Throughout the movie we see not just supporting characters, but every character dealing with their own individual struggles. We see both sides of every main character, whether it's icy Beau's vulnerability or Demille Bly as part cruel manager and part loving brother. There is no ""flat"" person in this story; at any time these could be real people at any race track, driving because it's their life.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, strong performances from Burt Reynolds and Robert Sean Leonard. Til Schweiger is also fantastic, effortlessly portraying the snobby race-driver Beau Brandenburg. Gina Gershon is to die for as the woman you love to hate, and Brent Briscoe always makes you laugh as the hilarious Crusher. For Pardue, I loved this part for him. Though he does slip up once, his role is absolutely believable from start to finish.<br/><br/>The special effects are pure fun. Not all of them are realistic, but the purpose is to draw you into the atmosphere, which they do.<br/><br/>Don't overthink it, just turn the volume up and enjoy it."

Working on the assumption that 90% of viewers would never have seen (let alone heard of) GRAND PRIX, Stallone wrote himself a ROCKY on the racetrack.<br/><br/>Cornball script, z-grade fx....well thats to be expected, the Formula 1 people were never going to allow a loser like Harlin and his production flunkies anywhere near near the real thing, unlike the latitude extended to John Frankenheimer during GRAND PRIX's filming in 1965.<br/><br/>Look, I'm not even wasting more words on this affront to cinematic good taste.

I'm a bit of a movie snob myself though, and after reading a review here (as I often do to pick which of half a dozen to see on the satellite), I decided I'd give it a look.<br/><br/>I have to totally agree that I think this is a lot of glam and within the whole scheme of things, how could you fit all the story lines...but this film got unnecessarily dogged.  Granted there were a couple unrealistic plot points like when the racers stopped and saved another driver.  I think he would have died for sure in real life, but this is hollywood.  Most of the special effects are unnoticable until a couple over the top scenes toward the end, but I liked this film.<br/><br/>If you've ever stood along side the track as a formula one car or an Indy racer blows by at 200 mph, you should dig this movie.  If you're looking for something profound in manner however, cut Stallone and this movie's producers some slack and just enjoy it for what it is.<br/><br/>It's not meant to be the explanation of the meaning of life, just a simple story with a little flash.

If I was, I would have really loved the movie. <br/><br/>Another appealing aspect was that the three lead characters were all good guys. There are annoying ""bad people"" in the movie but they are all minor characters.<br/><br/>The ending is predictable and, yes, there are some of the typical things you see and hear in many Sylvester Stallone films but not as dumb as many of them (the bad ones, that is.)<br/><br/>Because of the superlative visuals and audio, this is a good movie to see on a nice TV and a nice surround system.

","This load of garbage has to be one of the worse sports movies ever foisted on the movie going public. The storyline was trite and predictable, the acting was so wooden I thought I was looking at a story about dead trees and apart from some shots of actual CART races, which stood out as the only good looking bits of the movie, the cinematography and editing looked positively amateurish.  A couple of special effects looked ok but, as is often the case with inadequate movies, mostly they were used to cover for a load of crap. An example is the sequence where a car is flying through the air in slow motion while cars pass by underneath the car in a blur. Ridiculous. The racing incidents looked unrealistic and the cars racing through the city was positively ludicrous. A good example of the way to show a sequence like that is Smash Palace. Save your money, or time if you are thinking about watching the movie on TV. It is a shame that the scale only goes down to 1 as it deserves less than that. This movie also shows that Stallone was at his ""acting"" peak as the grunting mumbling blockhead in the Rambozo movies.<br/><br/>I would rather stick my most sensitive anatomical parts in a running blender filled with a cocktail of aftershave, iodine and salt water connected to the electrical mains than watch this load of fetid dingo droppings again."

The plot is good, also the screenplay, but Harlin - as an automobilistic races aficionado -looses his hand on this movie.Driven has goos camera angles, good editing but I thing it`s kind of repetitive when it starts to show one race after another... always the same sequence: 3 days before the race, some(good)dialogues and the race itself... all the way, `till the end. Sly is fine, but the movie has something overated... I don`t know if it is the computer effects or the jumped sequ√´nce of cenes. Cristian deLa Fuente is a good actor too, but his Portuguese is awful (something like my english, as You can read) Well, I think that Sly will make a new Rocky only when he get another $950.000 (that`s how much costs Rocky I) and direct himself a movie."

I really didn't like the role of Gina G., but everything else was very nicely done ESPECIALLY racing/crashing scenes.  They were just breathtaking.  The movie starts out kind of slow, but it builds up toward the end and you get to know the characters alot better.  Sure, every car racing movies have bad plots they say...

As I sat and watched this movie I started to grin, and the grin got bigger as the movie progressed. I've been waiting for a movie like this for 20 years. At last someone had the guts to make an old fashioned Action/Adventure/Romance movie with a humanity-triumphs-over-greed moral message. This is the best car race movie since Grand Priz. The race sequenses are sensational and the crashes are spectacular (make sure you see it on a big screen). The plot is cliched, contrived, and completely enjoyable. The acting is competent and predictable (except mabe for Burt Reynolds who looks and acts like he's had one too many face lifts).

","After all the preparations of getting hold of the state of the art race cars and setting them up on the racetrack, it is a shame and a disappointment to race fans to watch this movie, because it is so very unrealistic. Most of the action would never take place in real life racing. The chase-scene which includes the race cars in a down-town high speed pursuit is actually very intertaining if you disregard the computer-animated Playstation-inspired action sequences and the fact that racecars cannot be fired up by jumping into the drivers seat and turning the none-existing ignition key. If you are a race fan don't bother to watch this movie - it is too painfull."
"Trapster","9","16","31","19 September 2001"," Fun Movie; Great DVD
","I am very surprised by how poorly this film has been received by the movie-going public.  Both professional film critics from around the country as well as people from the general public are often tearing this film apart on every level - characters are underdeveloped, the editing is too choppy, the story is too simple, etc.  I think that people are being overly harsh, by a lot.<br/><br/>DRIVEN is a fun, highly entertaining film that I would recommend to most people.  I must admit, however, that I have a soft spot for both Renny Harlin and Sly Stallone.  Regarding Renny, I am a fan of Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger, and Deep Blue Sea (though I was not as impressed with Cutthroat Island and The Long Kiss Goodnight).  I really like his style of film-making and the way he shoots his action sequences.  I realize that his films are not worthy of Academy Awards, but they do succeed in what they set out to do.  Regarding Sly, I grew up on the Rocky and Rambo films and have been a fan of his for many years.  I see all of his movies in the theater, and I've recently been disappointed by some of his choices.  Get Carter was fine, but not as good as I had hoped it would be.  Thus, when DRIVEN was released I had high hopes for it and really wanted it to be good.  As it turns out, I was quite pleased.<br/><br/>Rather than discuss the plot of the film, which can be found in many reviews all over the Web, I thought I should mention The DRIVEN DVD that I just purchased.  The DVD is full of extras, all of which are very interesting. Renny's running commentary is engaging, and the behind the scenes featurettes are also quite informative.  What is most interesting is the 50 minutes of deleted scenes that are accompanied by a Stallone commentary. Here we get to watch scenes that were cut from the film and hear from Stallone what the original intent of the scenes were.  It turns out that the original cut of the film was 4 and a half hours long.  Clearly, Sly wrote a script that was filled with character development, but most of those scenes were cut in order to speed up the pacing of the film.  This is too bad, because I feel that the inclusion of some of these scenes would have made the film stronger.  Also, the DVD looks and sounds amazing.  The picture is sharp and the Dolby Digital sound is incredible.<br/><br/>If you are curious about this movie, I think that it is worth a rental, at least.  It may not be for everybody, but I think that it's much more fun that most of the movies that came out this summer."

","While Driven has some loose ends in the works (I don't think that people would come out of those car crashes with just hurt legs, they would be dead), it still delivers some good things along the way.  The film goes in the sense of George Carlin's statement, where else am I gonna see a 26 car collision, and not be in the SOB.  Because, the film not only shows the drivers, pressmen, owner's and driver's girlfriends, but the fans, and how many come to the races in hordes to watch cars go in a circle.<br/><br/>The film stars Stallone as a once great driver who comes in to assist Reynolds's new star driver (Pardue) to try and get his head together on and off the track.  Often, it seems director Harlin takes his cues from Stone's Any Given Sunday on many of the shots, but this is pretty much original (if you don't take into account that Cruise and Kidman flick).  Sometimes absurd, but it works in the popcorn movie sense.  Love the quarter trick. B+"
"Reel_entertainment","7","7","12","5 January 2002"," Above average racing movie
","There haven't been too many car racing movies that were good. Burt Reynold's 'Stroker Ace' was a good ol' boy comedy that pleased the fans that it was aiming for. Tom Cruise's 'Days Of Thunder' was just so-so. Sly Stallone's 'Driven' was much much better than the two combined. Sly also wrote the screenplay to the movie, which helped tremendously. The plot was decent, but the casting was just so-so. Sly was excellent as the retired car driver brought back into action to mentor a young rookie driver who's losing his edge midway through the season. Reynolds appears here also, this time as the car owner who employs Sly. Burt portrays his stearn character very well. You don't know if you like him or hate him in the movie. The rest of the cast was ok...could have been better, but when you have great racing scenes to make up for it, all is well. Critics & fans blasted this movie for all the wrong reasons. They saw it & expected 'The Deer Hunter'. The movie was made for racing & Stallone fans. Sly's screenplay made me think of Rocky...a retired has-been driver brought back for another chance. His acting & writing were great in the movie. Sly gets criticized often for his acting & roles, but does he make the great action movies to win oscars...? No, he does them for his fans. That's why the fans love him so much. Great work Sly, & I can't wait to see 'Avenging Angelo' in 2002."

"dsalluce","10","5","8","23 February 2003"," Impressive for what it intends to do
","I would have to say to anyone giving this film a bad rap to stop trying to be a film critic on a mission and to simply recognize what this film is. Driven quite simply aims to be an entertaining movie that gives fans of any kind of racing or dangerous sport a little story to follow while being entertained.<br/><br/>Different people will set out to view this film:<br/><br/>The CART racing aficionado will find him/herself wishing it was a little more true-to-life and a little less Hollywood. I mean c'mon, CART car drivers do not switch gears 10 times while going around an oval or superspeedway and passing. This film suffers the realistic feel much in the way any car buff would outright laugh at movies like Fast and the Furious. The crashes are a little overexaggerated as well.<br/><br/>The type of person looking for deep character development, an intriguing plot with twists, and something that makes them think for days after viewing should go see/rent A Beautiful Mind instead. This is a high action Stallone movie. You are fooling yourself to expect that much from an action movie of this type.<br/><br/>The action movie buff will love the frantic pace and camera work. The music goes perfect with the scenes and overall never really chills out until the credits roll. The sound (on DVD) a very nicely done. This is probably the only type of moviegoer that will be completely fulfilled by Driven. The crashes do not disappoint.<br/><br/>Even the girlfriend sitting next to you will not be bored because this movie manages a little love story as well. Estella Warren is superb although not dealt a very multifaceted script.<br/><br/>To conclude, I would say that Driven delivers in some way (albeit sometimes trivial) to most moviegoers. I was shocked to see what other people are saying about this movie. It is not bad at all. I would actually give it a 8/10 myself. In this age of movies like Pearl Harbor where the makers strive to fill every little void in a movie I was refreshed and awakened when viewing Driven. It did exactly what i was expecting while providing me with a little extra message on what it would take to be a race driver and being pulled 50 different ways.<br/><br/>All in all and a great way to waste some time, see some cool stuff, and be entertained. Do not look for anything that inspires or perplexes you, though. You will not be bored."

I understand why Formula 1 sent them packing, they read the script. C.A.R.T. on the other hand was so desperate they never read the script before then after the movie was out they were so embarrassed for taking part that they shut the series down and hid from public scorn.

","It's hard to know where to begin with Driven. As a lover of films and motor sport this manages to insult me on two levels at the same time. Not only is it an abysmal film, which drags out the sorts of clich√©'s that they didn't think would fly in 'Knight Rider'. The washed up older driver, the young stud, the bitter crippled ex-driver. PLEASE! If not being a script most four years old might reject isn't enough, its also taken Indy car racing and decided its a 'backdrop' and ignores virtual all technical and practical aspects of it for the sake of convenience. So what you have here is a racing film, for anyone who has never watched racing and an action film for people who think very poor CGI slow motion crashes are cool. Anyone who wants to see acting as such wasn't even considered. It was supposedly originally written as an F1 racing story, presumably once F1 had seen the script they chose not to be associated with this moronic enterprise. As far as the cast is concerned, it has to be said that Stallone has made some exceptionally bad choices in recent years regarding movies, and this is yet another. Burt Reynolds always looks to me like his about to crack up - because no on in their right mind would pay anyone to give such performances. The younger drivers all seemed to have come from the 90211 clone farm where they are given blank expressions and stupid hair styles. Bettering them all is Estella Warren, who gives the sort of line delivery which makes the puppet cast of Thunderbirds seem like they were members of the Royal Shakespeare! Is their anything good about Driven? Yes, it convinced me that I won't watch another Stallone movie unless it has five Oscars beforehand."

""Not for long.""<br/><br/>All the above are actual lines from Sylvester Stallone's screenplay for ""Driven,"" as if he was predicting the reception this spiritless racing film would get. To be fair, I hate sports and I fail to see what's so exciting about Formula One, Le Mans or C.A.R.T. (the milieu for Renny Harlin's latest opus) - but I still could and should have gotten some sort of thrill from the race scenes.<br/><br/>Instead you have a mass of clich√©d characters and poor acting (Burt Reynolds proves that he can actually sink even lower than shilling for British opticians), though since they have to spout dialogue that reminds you why Stallone hasn't had a writing credit since ""Cliffhanger"" (the last time he got together with Harlin) you can see why they have a hard time with it. Surprisingly, the best actors in this film are the non-professional ones - but some would say there's something seriously wrong with any film where Victoria's Secret/Sports Illustrated stunner Estella Warren and the ESPN announcers give the best performances (just one more reason why I'm looking forward to the ""Planet of the Apes"" remake).<br/><br/>But that would not be taking into account the bad editing and the ambitious but dreadful digital effects, not to mention the soundtrack (which is as horrible as Estella is gorgeous, and that's pretty damn horrible). It's so sterile it's amazing - even when a driver has a spectacular crash it only seems to have been put in for effect... and not to give away the ending, but don't the three fastest finishers in a race usually ascend the podiums in REVERSE order? (And why do the trucks for the scenes in Germany have ""German Grand Prix"" written on them in English?)<br/><br/>Returning to the subject of hidden messages, the song credits include one called ""Take Me Away From Here."" Amen - but the last line of the film (""It doesn't last long."") has to be a mistake, given that it takes two long hours to tell and runs out of gas before the end of the first lap. You'll get more entertainment from any episode of ""Speed Racer"" or ""Wacky Races"" (come to think of it, Estella would make a pretty good Penelope Pitstop). Heck, even ""Cannonball Run II"" is better than this. And that's a sentence I hope I never have to write again."

Also, a lot of the scenes are very fake looking, thanks to the terrible computer graphics.

Too many chiefs and not enough Indians, too little focus on the characters, questionable racing scenes that focus little on actual racing (which would seem to be a little important when making a film about racing). Take your pick. Stallone comes off too ""Rocky"" in many scenes, although his brief scenes with the lovely Stacy Edwards are well done. Burt Reynolds plays the role of the hardcore team owner without once cracking his signature smile, which is not only disappointing, but disheartening. Til Schweiger discussing emotions with Stallone? In real life, perhaps, but as two tough guys and champions having a tea and sympathy moment? It just doesn't work. Estelle Warren as a love interest works, with her lithe and lovely manners and obvious beauty, but her emotional level doesn't rise to the part. Perhaps the most unbelievable scene in the film is the emotional moment when Kip Pardue and Sly are racing about the city of Chicago in two experimental cars, violating every traffic law on the books, and endangering hundreds of lives, and yet receive no more than a $25,000.00 fine and no suspensions. In all, the characters are two dimensional at best, the superficial at worst, and the film is a waste of just under two hours of your precious time.

What an element of cheese this was! The good news is that they really didn't play into what again the 'classic' movie would have you played into....the guy gets the girl...he thought he had her but in the end she goes back with her husband. I thought he was going to die(Bly) trying to save that guy trapped under the car in the water... but they all got out OK.. because they have you liking this guy (Bly) throughout the film, and I really thought they were going to have him die off in a crash or something. But he ends up championing the last big race and becomes Champion, which is cool because you like the guy and you're happy to see him win in the end. I really like the way he plays a confused young man...I thought he got too steamed too quick about the girl...although I guess she WAS leading him on...or something. Stallone and Reynolds, I guess because they have been in so many movies, and, with all due respect, they are true relics, they make a movie seem almost unwatchable, because they ARE Stallone and Reynolds. I mean, they could have produced it but let some new person who needs the break star in it! That would have given it a shot of reality that it needed. I would say it is an okay movie.

Personally, I thought she did excellent in this movie, too, especially in a very dramatic moment with Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger) near the beginning.<br/><br/>I could go on all day about her. But let's move on.<br/><br/>I also have to admit that the beginning of the movie was so dumb I was laughing uncontrollably. But about halfway through, it all changed. I actually found myself getting into it. When Joe (Stallone) and Beau get into a discussion about Beau's love life and Joe offers some very wise advice, I was able to apply it to my own relationship-troubled life at the time.<br/><br/>The drama just builds from there and the story develops wonderfully. All silliness was lost in me as I marveled at each and every line. Jimmy gets angry after losing Estella and rides off into the streets of Chicago in his race car, while Joe follows closely behind, trying to get him to pull over. They finally wreck and a huge argument ensues.<br/><br/>`You don't know what the [censored] you're talking about!' shouts Jimmy.<br/><br/>`And you don't know who you are anymore!' Joe roars back.<br/><br/>The characters come closer together to achieve nothing short of a pure victory. Their relationships expand and the movie greatly improves.<br/><br/>I was so into the film-it changed my life.<br/><br/>It ends beautifully with Joe, Jimmy, and Beau holding their hands up together in friendship while Sophia (Estella) looks on. I have to admit I came close to shedding tears.<br/><br/>I know this movie has gotten a bad rap, and I suppose it deserves it in some aspects, but I will never forget the movie that has forever touched my heart: ""DRIVEN."""

Beneath the style there's very little substance indeed, with the film focusing on the boring young characters while leaving the seasoned pros (Stallone, Burt Reynolds) on the sidelines with little to do.<br/><br/>Even worse, the story is littered with discrepancies and plot holes, from criminal actions having no comeuppance to the general anything-to-win theme, which is all over the place.

","Sylvester Stallone simply can't seem to catch a break. Judge Dredd caused the star to be something of a joke with lines like ""I am the law!"". An attempt at an independent comeback in ""Copland"" actually offered quite a good performance, but the film went largely unnoticed. ""Driven"" was another film that was written by the star (as was ""Rocky"" and ""Cliffhanger""), but reviews and word of mouth kept audiences away. While not quite as poor as many made the film out to be (mainly thanks to flashy, entertaining direction by Renny Harlin), the film relies on cliches instead of bringing anything new to the table. Not that anyone's really brought anything new to the racing genre - ""Days of Thunder"" wasn't terrible, but it wasn't exactly much of a success, either. ""Driven"" plays like the racing version of Oliver Stone's football film ""Any Given Sunday"". This picture has the same sort of flash and striking cinematography, but it forgets the character development that the previous film at least was partially successful with. In fact, the cars remain the real stars of the movie here.<br/><br/>Stallone plays Joe Tanto, a former ace race car driver who's been out of the business for years, but asked to return by old friend Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds), who wants the old pro to ride alongside the new rookie, Jimmy Blye (Kip Pardue). Their competition is Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger). There's even a romantic triangle shoehorned into the plot, as Sophia (Estella Warren) moves back and forth between the two young racers.<br/><br/>There's several factors that make ""Driven"" suffer, though. Besides the lackluster nature of the screenplay, the performances are not particularly good, especially the two newcomers who play the competing racers. The only performance that really manages to shine is Warren. The former swimmer and Sports Illustrated model really does have a terrific presence and, impressively, is able to make the stereotypical lines of dialogue sound genuine. Hopefully, after performances here and in ""Planet of the Apes"", she'll move on to bigger and better things. Gina Gershon is stuck playing the Stallone character's ex-wife in a shrill subplot that goes nowhere. As for Stallone, he doesn't do a great deal here, nor does he seem to want to as he mostly appears content to set in the background and let the younger stars have their moment.7/10"

"HBeachBabe","Null","1","1","14 May 2001"," Better than should be, worse than it aims for
","I went to this expecting a bad action movie with good effects. After all, it was written by and stars King of Cheese Sly Stallone, was directed by the grand Cheesemaker Renny Harlin and features Burt Reynolds, who was making cheesy car crash movies when Sly was still a bit player.<br/><br/>What I discovered was a racing movie that desperately wanted to be more... it aims for Rocky but lands somewhere around Rocky IV.  There is actually an attempt at a more complicated story that your typical sports movie.  I will give them points for the attempt, but I think Sly is overreaching, as his writing ability is unable to keep up with his goals.  The female characters are underdrawn, mostly unnecessary, and for act 3 unseen.  The dramatic structure is rather unfocused as well, In trying to have an antagonist who really isn't such a bad guy, the challenge for the hero isn't as compelling, plus, it's unclear who the real lead of the film is- Sly or the kid.  Sly simply has too many plot lines and character arcs going on and can't quite successfully juggle them all.<br/><br/>I accept that in a race movie like this, the races themselves are going to be shown in a ""heightened"" manner that isn't realistic, and will of course feature far more crashes than ever actually occur.  Given that caveat, I found the crashes, often done with digital effects to be quite thrilling & harrowing.  Where the digital effects clearly fail though were during the last race for the otherwise impossible to get camera angles, which looked like video game shots.  I had to wonder if near the end they started running out of money to fully render the shots.<br/><br/>As for comparisons to Days of Thunder, any objective reviewer will tell you that that film sucked.

"MadReviewer","6","1","1","1 May 2001"," A Wildly Uneven Film
","""Driven"" suffers from an unpolished script and witless direction, but despite the flaws, it's still decent.  Not good, not great, but decent. No amount of rewrites would ever make this a great film, but it comes close at times to being good.  In a way, it's more frustrating to see a film like this than a truly awful one, because there's so much promise for a movie like ""Driven"" . . . but in the end, it falls well short of that promise.<br/><br/>The story, written by Sylvester Stallone, is wildly uneven.  Good at times, awful at others, it plays out like a rough draft, still needing a little -- okay, a lot -- of polish.   Jimmy Bly (Kip Pardue) is a young race car driver with a lot of talent and a lot of uncertainties -- he's finding it difficult to deal with the pressures of being on top.  To help Jimmy deal with the pressure, his boss, Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds), enlists the help of retired racer Joe Tanto (Sylvester Stallone), to be a mentor and advisor to Jimmy.  Jimmy's ups and downs through the racing season are chronicled -- his relationships with Tanto, with his chief rival Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger), and with his weaselly brother (and agent) Demille (Robert Sean Leonard).<br/><br/>There's certain moments of the story that border on being genuinely touching and brilliant -- Tanto's relationship with Brandenberg, for example, which could've easily degenerated into an overly cliched Rocky/Ivan Drago rivalry, is much more complex and interesting than expected.  Stallone does a good job of either avoiding the obvious cliches or putting a new spin on them, making for a neat story that comes across fresh, and not just a re-tread of ""Rocky"".  Other moments, though, defy common sense and hurt the film.  For example, the fact that Bly and Brandenburg constantly finished 1-2 in every single race is odd enough, but when Carl Henry starts implying that he'd fire Bly . . . come on!  The guy at least finishes second in every race! Who can you get who'll be better?  It becomes commonplace in ""Driven"" to see characters act completely irrationally or against everything they've said in previous scenes to add conflict to a scene, and the lack of logic becomes tiresome and stupid.  Add into this car races that come across more as Playstation 2 fantasies instead of, well, real, and ""Driven"" lurches unsteadily between magic and moronic in the space of seconds.<br/><br/>Stallone's pretty good as Tanto -- he keeps faithful to his role as a mentor, staying a supporting character and wisely avoiding the chance to make himself the hero once more.  Burt Reynolds does well with the part of Carl Henry, not chewing the scenery (much).  The part's poorly written, but Reynolds makes the most of it.  The highlight of ""Driven"" is Til Schweiger as Brandenburg, who transforms what could've been a stock guy-you-want-to-hate part into somebody who demands grudging respect. With any luck, Mr. Schweiger will be in many more mainstream films sometime soon. Unfortunately, he also does such a good job that he completely overshadows Kip Pardue as Jimmy Bly, who's supposed to be nervous and unsure of himself. . . but instead, he just comes across as a whiner.  Considering that Bly's also supposed to be the hero of ""Driven"", the weak performance hurts the film.  (Special mention: Gina Gershon as Tanto's bitchy ex-wife Cathy. Tiny part, but man, is she awesome.)<br/><br/>And then, there's the direction.  A federal law should be passed barring Renny Harlin from ever directing another motion picture ever again.  With obscenely fast camera cuts, a blaring, overly loud soundtrack, and scene set-ups that simply defy all logic, Mr. Harlin has taken the concept of pacing a story and cheerfully bludgeoned it to death.  There's little time to sit back and enjoy some of the quieter scenes in ""Driven"", and sadly, it's these little moments that actually make the film enjoyable. Everything is presented at such an urgent, frenetic pace; it's easy to stop caring about the scenes that actually need to be urgent.  ""Driven"" would've benefited greatly from the presence of a different director -- it's that bad.<br/><br/>With the benefit of another rewrite (and another scriptwriter), and especially another director -- one with a shred of talent -- ""Driven"" could've been good.  Instead, the high points and low points average out to a very, very mediocre film.  It's a shame.  Grade:  C+"

","Jimmy Bly is an up and coming name in Formula 1. He is leading the championship with rival Beau Brandenburg but the pressure is starting to take hold. To help out, team boss Carl Henry brings in old pro Joe Tanto to replace Bly's team mate Memo Moreno. Joe tries to reach Bly and give him the benefit of his experience off the track as well as his skills on the track. Meanwhile, off the track a tangled web of simmering romances, lost loves, friendships and past conflicts conspire to make the championship about more than the result of twenty races.<br/><br/>This film seemed to do almost nothing in the UK cinemas but when it came to TV I caught it. I could vaguely remember a lot of talk about Stallone wanting to make a Formula 1 movie and as a semi-fan of the sport I knew he was often to be found hanging around the pits. This labour of love then, has created a film that is about as generic and obvious as you could want it to be. At the core of the story is a couple of old chestnuts about, well, an old chestnut teaching a rookie the ropes while the rookie undergoes a crisis of confidence. Obviously worried that these clich√©s wouldn't be enough, the writers load the film with lots of romances, conflicts and so on. Narrative-wise none of them really work since all of them are half-cooked and just designed to fill the time rather than do anything special.<br/><br/>The action is what most viewers will be here for and I suppose it is at least noisy and ""high-octane"". Fans of Formula 1 in its ""pure"" form will baulk at the overblown races and the absurd car chase and even those who find F1 dull will find themselves snickering at the silliness of the whole thing. With all this happening the cast are stuck in the middle. Stallone is a solid presence but is really just acting for his own sake rather than the film. Pardue is far too bland to care the film and seems to have little or no range to speak of. Schweiger has been told to ""do a Schumacher"" and this is all he does. De la Fuente has heard a voice telling him to ""do a Van Damme"" so this is what he does while a totally wasted Gershon molls beside him through gritted teeth. Warren is pretty while Reynolds doesn't convince in his scenes and looks like a man who has been pulled and tucked five too many times.<br/><br/>Overall then this is movie-by-numbers time. There is nothing specific to watch it for really; the plot is delivered in basic blocks while the action may please some but is generally too overblown and silly to really engage or convince. Fun for Stallone to indulge himself while making it I'm sure but sadly nobody really seemed to be thinking about the audience that much."

He has his ""oscar"" scene towards the end where he laments his chair, and still says he'd do it all over again. It was supposed to be dramatic, but I just thought it was funny, maybe the two worst prolific actors of our time in Reynolds and Sly on the screne in the ultimate s***ty drama scene. Young Jimmy Bly, played by some other poor soul, has a crisis of confidence, just like Cruise in ""Days of Thunder"", not to mention a fued that develops between him and Robert Sean Leonard, who has fallen from ""Dead Poet's Society"" 14 years ago to working alongside Stallone, Reynolds, and the guy who played Bly.<br/><br/>Fortunately, it all works out in the end.

","I have this theory about Sly Stallone's career. If you have made close observation about his career then you'll notice that back in the late `70s Stallone wrote a couple of interesting and decent dramatic pictures. Then the `80s arrived and he transformed himself into an action star and did a couple of good action films in the `80s and early `90s. Then the mid-90s arrived and Stallone already approaching 50+ years became to old to be accepted for any action roles. So since that time he has become a struggling actor, whose career is being driven towards the toilet.<br/><br/>
Now I believe if throughout the `80s and early `90s Stallone would have balanced action films with dramatic ones he would right now not be in the situation he is at! <br/><br/>Now his movie Driven is an improvement from his last couple of efforts but it still doesn't live up to be a decent picture. The women, especially Estella Warren are beautiful and the film contains SOME impressive racing sequences. Still at the end it's not a good movie.<br/><br/>1 1/2(*1/2)out of 4(****)stars"

","I remember when the trailer for Driven was being shown on tv I told myself that Driven looked cool. I saw Sly on tv promoting it and I decided to check it out. And I am tellin' you I am glad I did. Driven is a good change of pace for Sly, it is just a shame it didn't do as well at the box office as it should have. <br/><br/>Stallone plays Joe Tanto, a retired race car driver, who is brought out of retirement to help a rookie win the championship. <br/><br/>Stallone, unlike most of his other roles, put a lot of heart into this movie, but he was really the no. 2 man, next to Kip Pardue. No offense to Sly, but he is really not the one who carries this movie. Sure he is a hell of an actor, but he was given a second rate position which I feel was both good and bad to the rest of the cast. A lot of this movie entails arguments with a former love(Gina Gershon). This really wasn't productive to the rookie, by any means but really this is about the life of professional race car drivers and the hell that I can only imagine they go through. <br/><br/>The chemistry flowed really well between the characters. The acting was superb by everyone, what an emotional roller coaster ride it was indeed.<br/><br/>
The only problem was that the crash scenes were too fake, and this you could tell because special effects were used too much. But over all this movie was not bad at all. Sly has built a reputation it seems for lousy movies in the last 5 years, and to all you Stallone fans out there, it will get better.

This up close and personal speedfest is at first impressive, then after the first two races it become repetative reminding me why I never watch a car race from start to finish, ""Wow, that was fast - how many more times around? 150 laps? Crap."". Lord only knows what inspired this cinematic opus (yes, I know that there cannot be such a thing as a cinematic opus, as the root of an opus is musical, but I love challenging the structure of the English language.)<br/><br/>Stallone plays an old hat racer that is brought back into the sport by Burt Reynolds to coach the rookie kid that has the skills but needs some direction. As blockage in Stallone's path is the rookies obsessive brother/agent, Stallone's ex-wife, and of course his old nemesis. A predictible storyline, bad acting, unlikable characters and a snore after the first half hour make me think that there are only two things that can save a movie like this: cool crash scenes and nudity. It sadly only delivers one of these.<br/><br/>
The crashes are impressive and the special effects that put you ""in the driver's seat"" are breathtaking, but that alone is not enough to carry an entire movie. One of the CG effects really annoyed the hell out of me, however: during a race in the rain, it shows a first person view of the driver . Realistically, all you would see is a smokescreen of water coming off the tires of the racer in front and shooting at you at 220 miles per hour, but instead, it looks like someone tossing blobs of hair gel at 5 MPH. <br/><br/>I honestly cannot recommend this movie even for rental. I wasn't expecting this to be a good film, but I was expecting it to be fun.

","If you're going to see this movie sometime in your lifetime, go see this in a movie theater rather than on video. The races in the movie are the reason why because they both look and sound good. There are several F/X gaffes in the movie but no F/X film is perfect.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this was all the filmmakers focused on. I had trouble taking this movie seriously because the movie treats CART racing as reverent as the NFL or NBA. Can you name any real-life driver from this type of racing (NASCAR drivers do not count)?<br/><br/>So, it is this movie's job to make me care and inform me about what sport event I'm missing out on. Fails to do that b/c of the weak script and character development (as explained by other astute reviewers here).<br/><br/>How does this movie compare to Days of Thunder? Let's just say that Tom Cruise is the more convinving hero of the two. Listening to Stallone pass advice is a good chuckle.<br/><br/>One annoying thing about the movie: the race announcer who acts as the narrator during a race and telling us, the movie audience, what's going on. Are we really that dumb to not know what's going on?<br/><br/>Fun tip: Here's an idea for a drinking game. Every time someone pulls out a laptop computer, take a shot. You'll know what I mean."

","As a 7th year CART fan, I can tell you this movie was horribly inaccurate and just plain bad. Facts are so off; IMDb will have a field day with the goofs in this movie.  The plot was weak, and inconsistencies are everywhere. (e.g.: Methanol burns clear, and dilutes EASILY with water; last year (2000), Mercedes-Benz dropped out of CART; pit-lane DOES happen to have a speed limit). How about the seen in the previews when they're racing through traffic on an open street? Well, that's likely not going to happen seeing how the belly of those cars rest maybe 1-3 inches off of the ground. If you like fast-paced, fake action, see Driven, but if you're a CART fan hoping that finally the movie has come for your favorite racing series ... sorry, this movie will only disappoint. The movie tries to make up for lack of good material by flashing the occasional shot of some hot chick. This movie was in no way a better than any movie Sly was in, it will never even compete with movies like Judge Dredd, and ESPECIALLY not with any of the Rocky flicks ... yes, even Rocky 5 was better than Driven."

"jon.h.ochiai","7","0","0","30 April 2001"," Sly and Crafty Comeback
","Sylvester Stallone's action movie return in Renny Harlin's ""Driven"" marks a distinction change in the star's role. Stallone's Joe Tanto is a racing driver sensei, mentor, who was a great driver, drawn out of retirement to coach a young and very talented race car driver, Jimmy Blye (played by Kip Pardue). Tanto coaches Blye on racing and... life. Perhaps, this is trite. Though this seems like a genuine effort from Stallone to phase out the lead action hero part, and take on being the sage adviser to the young action studs like, Kip Pardue and and Til Schweiger. To his credit Sly is very comfortable and convincing in this persona. His script is clunky and very melodramatic with such dialog exchanges between himself and Pardue, ""You don't know who you are?"" Excellent question, though like some of the other pieces it seems out of place in this movie. The story is predictable. However, Renny Harlin's direction and visual mastery of the racing sequences keep the movie going, and for the most part engaging. Kip Pardue (last seen in ""Remember the Titans"") is good here. Too bad his character does not have much say. It's amazing the women's roles are so forgettable. Stacy Edwards is interesting as Stallone's love interest which seems like an after thought. Why are Gina Gershon and Estella Warren in the movie? Gershon is wasted here-- she is a good actress. On the other hand, Estelle Warren is a waste of time here."

","It seemed impossible that a story could be made about racing that would stay interesting and yet have that amount of realism that would allow the ardent racing fan to appreciate it as well. Surprisingly, this is what 'Driven' has pulled of in magnificent fashion. Sly has finally bounced back with a visually stunning movie that takes you on a 195 mile/hour ride,in a great performance as Joe Tanto. A role that shows a great deal of his acting talent and almost nothing of his physical abilities that he's famous for. Perhaps the only draw back to the movie is the slightly overdone emotional scenes and a completely unexpected race across city streets that seemed unnecessary and rather unrealistic. Altogether, the movie is a definite  must see, real fun and exciting."

","I am a Formula 1 and CART fan and I am a movie lover.  Driven is a mix of two of my passions and I was excited to go and see it.  I wanted to love this film.  But to my disappointment, this is a dreadful film.<br/><br/>(Slight Spoiler)<br/><br/>There are three good scenes.  1) The rescue of a drowning driver by two of the main characters who stop their cars during the race to save him.  This scene is very dramatic but is spoiled by how unrealistic the crash is.  2) The scene where they drive through the streets of Chicago at 195mph.  As unrealistic as the scene is, it is more believable than some of the things that happen in the races themselves.  3) Fleeting footage of real races and real-life drivers (Montoya, Papis, Moreno, etc.)  In my mind, the real-life drivers are infinitely bigger stars than the supposed stars of the movie and I was thrilled to see them on the big screen.<br/><br/>So those are the good things.  Here are the bad things:<br/><br/>There are some ridiculously over-the-top crashes.  The sport is dramatic enough without having to be exaggerated by movie-makers.  There would be enough excitement if the crashes were more true to life.<br/><br/>We never get to know the any of the characters.  In general, they are shallow and remarkably fickle.  One minute Estella Warren is in the Target pits rooting for one guy and the next minute she's in the Motorola/Nextel pit rooting for the other guy.  Gina Gershon's character is flat-out bad. We never get to know about Stallone's self-destructive past.  Burt Reynolds looks plastic.  I could go on and on.<br/><br/>Technically, the racing is quite inaccurate.  You do not go faster just by changing gear.  You cannot drive as fast as the leaders when your front left suspension has buckled.  Burning fuel creates an invisible flame - not a traditional orange flame.  I could go on for a bit here too.<br/><br/>The commentators are annoyingly dumb.  For example, it is impossible to start a race from the ""29th pole position.""<br/><br/>In all, I say this movie gets some credit just for being about racing.  But it is a bad film.  3.5/10."

","First of all, let me start by saying that I am a fan of racing, and because of this ""Driven"" might be held to a higher standard.  If you are a racing fan of any sort, you will leave the theater insulted, even more so than ""Days of Thunder"" (there had to be the inevitable comparison).  I went to the film with low expectations, paying the $5 to see cool racing scenes, cool sound and Gina Gershon.  The racing scenes were poor at best.  I think they showed cars getting airborne 3 times, this in cars with enough downforce to suck potholes off the ground when they go over them.  To its credit, the sound was tip top, and Gina Gershon played the catty ex-wife perfectly.  Everything else, save Sly's Crash Davis type role, fell flat. I was asked at work last night what the film was about, and all I could reply was ""I'm not sure.""  While a plot was not Driven's primary goal, it could have at least tried.  Lastly, the visual affects were horrible.  The computer animation seems to have taken a step backwards.  The computer generated racing scenes looked like a video game instead of being imposed on filmed scenes, and the latest computer games look better.  This is the kind of movie I like to have on DVD for passing time with cool effects and sound. I will not be buying this one.<br/><br/>CART should have known better than this."

Renny Harlin used TOO much artistic license in some of the crash scenes (unless CART is stupid enough to allow the possibility of a Champ Car flying over a wall and landing in a friggin' LAKE!). Plus most CART fans will get a kick out of guessing where the sloppily edited race scenes were filmed, though on most occasions, the location stated was actually the right one...<br/><br/>When the movie was good, it was good: loud CART turbo engines (thank goodness they edited out the F1 sounds), fast-paced racing, and Gina Gershon in that stunning dress at the banquet...other than that, all that was left were the cameos towards the end of the stars of the 2000 CART season that might get some of the fans smiling...<br/><br/>But when it was bad, it was pretty bad: clich√©ish dialogue, an all-to-predictable ending, and terrible character development.

It's just another popcorn movie with relatively flawless characters but extremely entertaining action sequences. The effects look very good and the editing is very fast, so that you don't even have time to think about the movie's realism at all. Overall, not as good as other films by Renny Harlin( for example Die Hard 2, Cliffhanger or the brilliant The Long Kiss Goodnight )and even Stallone made better movies ( First Blood, Lock Up or Assassins for example ) , but it's an okay movie for some beers with some buddies on a Saturday evening.

","I was looking forward to this film. Some well known actors mixed with some relatively unknown's, a good old competitive story, with high octane motor racing, the latest special effects, glamour and a sexy girl thrown in for good measure. It seemed like a recipe for success. Oh dear! Even my 7 year old son thought this was pap! The fundamental problem with this film is it never develops one single character and for the first hour you really can't decide who you like out of the 2 main racers. As it develops you're really left feeling that they are all a bunch of complete di**s. In addition there are some major flaws in the film, like how do they end up being so close on points and some very irritating similarities to real F1 motor racing people, especially Frank Williams. If your a sad git that still think you can turn your Vauxhall Nova into a Ferrari by colour coding the bumpers, installing a fat and noisy exhaust and blacking out the windows, then you'll probably think this is the best thing ever, but if you appreciate a good story, interesting characters, believable action then give this a miss."

","****************************** SPOILERS ********************************<br/><br/>
Driven passed by UK cinemas with barely an eye flicker - it had a bit of an advertising budget behind it but lost out to fairly poor reviews and small attendances. As the film comes round for rental release, the story is the same. There aren't many copies out on the shelf and it's not in the rental charts.<br/><br/>So why bother? For a few reasons actually: this film reminded me in a few ways back to ""The Fast and The Furious"". It's got a good soundtrack, fast cars and some 'mean' camera angles. As a fan of Formula 1, I have however little knowledge of Indy Car racing. yet this seems fairly realistic!<br/><br/>
Admittedly a lot of the rev sounds were blatantly from F1 cars and the crashs were OTT and the Special FX fake. Yet for every single special effect that you may have noticed, there would have been another 10 that you didn't. For instance a lot of the crowds and backdrops were computer generated; cars that weren't there were put in; and so on. All these have been done so professionally they are undetectable to the naked eye.<br/><br/>
And although a film needs to glamourise its material, there is glamour in the racing world. There are Indy babes and beautiful girls and glamourous events, and Driven does a fairly good job of giving us a peak of this world.<br/><br/>On a performance note, Syl Stallone is not as poor as I often consider him. It is possible that he could be an Indy Car driver; in a way he reminds me of a slightly older David Coulthard. Burt Reynolds is good here, a fresh young cast give the impression that these could be real drivers, not to mention the real drivers themselves (!!) together with a few nice shots of Montoya and others (I noticed Jean Alesi and Jacques Villeneuve hiding somewhere in the credits). On the female side of the cast, Estella Warren hasn't got a pivotal role in the film but she is in quite a few scenes and adds a welcome and multi-dimensional addition to the cast... plus she's gorgeous as usual.<br/><br/>The way the film falls out is on subject matter and ending... it was obviously from the beginning we were talking about a plot going something like ""young guy gets scared, needs guidance then kicks back and wins"". And yes, I must conceed that Driven is about relationships as well as driving but to make a great movie in a little over 100 minutes there's not time for both - it has to be one or the other.<br/><br/>As said before, the realism is nice. They must have shot a lot of the film in conjunction with the actual-real-live races and this is nice because it adds to that realism. But a race takes 90 minutes in real time plus pre and post commentary so to try and cram races in to the span of a film is pushing it. Not that you need to show the whole race but five minute clips aren't enough to get a good feel of it all.<br/><br/>In summary, there are a few popints that drag the film down but a multitude that hold it back up. Maybe my love of F1 biases me towards the racing material of the film, but hey, there's fast cars, Estella and Gina, and some cracking cinematography (including some intricate and ingenious car mounted cameras). Even though the plot has to be constrained slightly but actual events and follow the film through to the logical conclusion, there is a plot. So you could say it's a bit like ""The Fast and The Furious"" except it's got a plot as well!!"
"supertom-3","5","0","0","11 April 2002"," Stallones fall continues!
","Stallones last couple of offerings have been real flops. Firstly a remake of, hardly a classic, Get Carter, that was followed by this little number, Driven. While both films were not all that bad, they did not merit the amount of money spent on them or the talent Sly possesses, and like his former rival Ah-nuld, often wastes. Of course Sly is by far the better actor but we all know that a lot of Arnie flicks could and should have been better. Of Stallones two recent fares, Get Carter is probably the better film but Driven is far more enjoyable to watch than the overly dark and at times dull remake of the cult hit with Mickey Caine in the 70's. 	Anyway, Driven is basically half music video and half soap opera with the odd break for an exciting race sequence. The direction in the film is a little shoddy at times and there are moments that ooze with pure cheese of the stinkiest variety. Slys script is pretty poor it has elements he has written before and to explain to you what I mean just think Rocky 5 on wheels without the twist of Rocky's student betraying Rocky. What Stallones script does do well is the amount of characters given good roles, with depth. This film is definitely a character based film but poor dialogue and lame direction outside of the race scenes make you feel as if your watching an episode of neighbours. The bad points of the script? Well these are the plot and the dialogue. The plot is wafer thin and old and the dialogue is so tacky at times, admittedly some of it is good though but only the odd inspired moment.<br/><br/>	Although the film features a lacklustre screenplay and cheesy direction I have to say that the acting is top notch. Sly in particular is in good form, he has definitely given himself a role with some challenge. The others are good too, Til Schweiger as the German race driver who is the main rival to young hotshot Jimmy Bly played well by Kip Pardue. Also on her studio debut the gorgeous Estella Warren does a credible job. Burt Reynolds ranges from the top of his game to slighting hamming but he has some of the better scenes including  a good one with Sly. 	The selling point of the film, which didn't sell it very well, are the exceptional racing sequences which make a boring sport seem extremely exciting. The special effects are some of the best around, with exceptional crashes such as a car flying through the air in bullet time as other racers fly by underneath. While some effects are dazzling some seem to lack effort such as a digital coin and sewer lid. While these scenes don't quite save the rest of the film they do build up the excitement levels at just the right time so you never become too bored watching the uninteresting relationships and double dealings. Overall this film has its plus points but they are outweighed by negatives. Renny Harlin has proven himself as a great action director but a drama like this and he looks lost outside of the race sequences. Sly had better do something better than this and fast if he is to resurrect his career. 5/10"

","***possible spoilers***<br/><br/>This is just absolute rubbish. I mean, this is probably the worst film about motor racing I have ever seen. The actors were wooden and the characters either bland or incredibly stupid. For instance, the team owner threatens to sack his rookie driver, who's already won something like five races so far that year, unless he wins another. It's his first year and he wins five? In my book that's a hell of a reason to keep him around.<br/><br/>But it's the racing scenes that really let the film down. The words 'Totally unrealistic' do not come close to describing it.<br/><br/>Then there's the chase in two racing cars through the streets of Chicago. All though it does look nice, it is very flawed. For one thing, Sly jumps in a car to go after the rookie, and the car just starts right up. Now I'm pretty sure that cars like that don't start with a key, but in fact need a special tool operated by a mechanic in order to get going. And why did the cars have a full tank of fuel?<br/><br/>Terrible stuff."

I'm sure Harlin could have made a film with a better effects (like Deep Blue Sea) or at least a better story (The Long Kiss Goodnight). The only thing I liked a bit about this film, was the abundance of German celebs. I found it quite entertaining to see them pop up. There was of course Til Schweiger (an actor who some might have seen in The Replacement Killers), Jasmin Wagner (a singer - presenter also known as Bl√ºmchen or Blossom in other countries) and Verona Feldbush (a presenter with a dummie image and a lousy actress (she didn't say a word in this film, I WONDER WHY!!!)).<br/><br/>

Otherwise, all the people involved have serious problems with their minds. Most of the incidents are totally unrealistic in dynamics and the infamous rescue from the river scene is incredible: the screenwriter has stolen one of the real dramatic moments of the history of F1 - Lauda at Nurburbring in 1976 - making it a sort of heroic icon of pilots that stop the race to save a collegue who was dying, but in ""Driven"" all is so totally untrue, false and derivative that it sounds pathetic and disgusting. The only reason to watch the movie is, in fact, Gina Gershon - far sexier than Estella Warren, a sort of patinate beauty that is such only on the cover of the magazines, not in the real life.

","I really didn't know what to expect when I went to see Driven. Sure, Stallone was/and still is one of my favorite actors. I liked everything that he did, Even when no one else would. I enjoyed Get Carter, but I DID notice that it was not at the quality of; let's say Cliffhanger or Demolition Man. So, I didn't know what to expect. I am glad to say that I came back pleasantly surprised. Driven is awesome. It DOES rank up there with Cliffhanger (also by Renny Harlin, who directed this movie) and Demolition Man. It is loud, action packed, exciting, and stars Stallone. I have been waiting a while to say that again. This IS one of Stallone's best. I think that everyone should see it, if even for the racing scenes and the crash scenes, because they are some of the best that I have seen. I have always like Harlin's work (even Cutthroat Island) and I would rank this too as one of his best. I highly recommend that people see this. I would give it a 10/10. I think that Sly is finally back. See it, I don't think that you will be disappointed. 10/10 AWESOME!!!"

","I didn't really expect much walking into Driven. In fact only one thing was on my mind, watching some killer racing scenes with some bad ass crashes. I certainly got what I wanted, not much more though.<br/><br/>The acting and story are fairly average. I'm not going to complain too much but it was certainly cheesy in many parts. Stallone does a decent job as an old, retired racer returning to help Kip Pardue get his sh*t together on the racetrack. I found him entertaining at best but his performance in this movie certainly doesn't compare to Rocky. Pardue's character is fairly bland and predictable, as is pretty much the entire plot. The rest of the cast fall in line the same way.<br/><br/>Now on to the good stuff. THE RACING! There certainly is enough of it. There's probably at least one race every 15 minutes in the movie. That's a good thing though, especially after gone in sixty seconds which I didn't think had nearly enough racing. The races are fast and exciting and the crashes are breathtaking, if not 100% realistic. Many people complain about the CGI being too obvious but let's put it this way, whenever there's a shot where there's no way in hell they could get a camera there, it's CG. All in all I thought they did a good job on the CG, it's a perspective that you wouldn't be able to get under any other circumstance and it's definatly fun to look at, even if you know it's fake.<br/><br/>One thing that bugged me was the constant jump cuts and jerky camera angles. During the races it's expected and didn't bother me but they even shot slow, talking scenes that way which can get pretty irritating. It's like that whole movie was just a big party in the editing room.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to go see it with your friends and don't analyze it too much, otherwise you'll ruin the fun. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give Driven a 7."

","This movie falls into that category of films that are bad but just a little bit fun to watch and not boring. I was surprised to see that Oliver Stone didn't direct this because it's almost exactly like Any Given Sunday. I'm not sure why anyone would want to make a movie in the style of Stone, but maybe some people like that kind of stuff. It's also a lot like Days of Thunder with a hot young driver and the older teachers. Some of the actors even look like people from that movie! So, basically, if you've seen these movies there's not much point in watching this one unless you're into action and there are some good racing scenes. Another plus for guys is going to be the countless t&a shots. I thought the women were not that great looking actually, and much preferred seeing Gina Gershon who is not only extremely hot, but gives pretty much the best performance here. That I think tells you something about this movie! One other note: Stallone was really not bad in this contrary to what I've heard so far here. 5 out of 10."

If the scenes that were cut (or greatly altered in this case) were left in, this story would be greatly enhanced and you would have a greater appreciation (and understanding) for the characters. Unfortunately, the powers that be must have felt that the audience would rather see action and cars instead of a real human interest story. Also, if the film was shown as originally shot, the story would be about Sylvester Stallone's character, instead of a racer coming of age. Sly shows that he can write, and write well.

It is extremely rare for that a head on collision occurs a car goes air borne over the barrier.  That is rare.  Most of the time these cars just slam into the wall and that is it.

Sorry I was rambling, let me start with the bashing, but this time I am going to start with the good news: The trailer is the best thing about this movie, if the movie was just the trailer it would have been one of the best of 2001. The quick scenes and music of the preview are awesome. Some of the race scenes in the movie are some of the best if not the best of any racing movie. Other wise the movie is a total piece of crap. Let give you the reader a brief summary of said movie: The movie is about a rookie who is burning up the track of either the indy or formula series of cart racing, but lacks the discipline and pure love of racing. So Stallone is called in by Burt Reynolds to help his star rookie to get that certain edge, Stallone has trouble doing this because the rookies brother is his manager and always has the star racer at promotions. Eventually he finally breaks through to the rookie, but thats after a scene when the two Stallone and the rookie racer race through the streets of downtown Chicago. The end is predictable, but I will not tell who or what happens sorry.If you are going to waste your money then by all means do so, but don't say I did not warn you!"

If one looks into *any* real world setting there are NO extremes...There are people that are dislikable and perhaps have a lot of ""bad"" in them but they are not the total evil psychotic characters you catch in many movies/books. In most real life situations your ""characters"" are neither all good nor all evil...simply balences of the two.<br/><br/>In the movie there were people dislikable...Burt Reynolds character catching a lot of that or perhaps Joe (Sly Stallone) ex wife. But they had their redeeming qualities as well.. It did indeed add a realism..something that people strive for in films but rarely acheive.<br/><br/>The only fault I have is with the cinematography... The fast flashes of every new ""race"" was a bit much and it did not make it easy to follow what was happening.

"ptwomey","Null","0","0","28 August 2001"," Best Par film to date... stress the PAR!
","One normally does not expect much from a Stallone film, this one actually delivers more than a few suprising moments. Firstly you have to realise this is a racing film, an average one at that, so if you don't like racing perhaps this is not your cup of tea, but other aspects make it worth a look.<br/><br/>I never thought a film written by Stallone could have a few original interpretations of the old sports rival story. For starters, the tradition bad guy is not a bad guy, he even ends up getting the girl. The good guy is at some points more of a litte brat than anything else, and the wise man (Stallone himself) is actually just a good bloke who really does have something good to say. Overall the characters and their interactions is above average for these kinds of average stylish action films... and stylish it is.<br/><br/>The camera work in parts is original and fresh, the use of computer generated images was worth a shot but it is by no mean refined. Some of the action works quite well whilst the rest ends up a little over the top. The fast paced film gives you no chance to slow down and this helps in making you feel the pressure the young rookie is feeling. There is also one aspect that I call tunnel vision (block everything out) that looks good and has some hidden ""real life"" implications, which if you want to find, they are hidden quite well by stallone through many sub-texts.<br/><br/>The film, like all of these films, falls down about two thirds of the way through. The car chase in the city is what lost it, followed shortly by a massively overdone car crash and then followed by the final race with at times felt too ""created"". Then the end was a little dissapointing too, suddenly in one frame the entire cast becomes enlightend and everyone is happy! BORING! we all know real life is not so!<br/><br/>Overall this film is worth a look if you truly do not want to have a burden placed on your mind, it is fast, neat and at time very good but it won't overload your system with anything besides entertainment. If your in the mood for an action film with a bit of s difference, than Stallones effort is worth a look!"

The characters are well written, well cast and without exception well acted.  The only let downs are the horrendously below-par special effects, and an epilogue-free ending which could have been rounded off more nicely.

"giancarlorocks","Null","0","0","19 August 2001"," Driven...at a medium pace
","As the summer movie season approaches, the moviegoer is drenched with a profile of high octane, glamorous previews that simply demand our attention. The first entry into the pile is the new Sylvester Stallone film, ¬ëDriven'. Upon seeing the trailers and teasers for this film I was wondering to myself, is this the movie that will open the summer blockbuster movie season of 2001? Usually, the crown for the opening film goes to a typical Hollywood blockbuster that practically smashes all competition at the box office. Yet, while ¬ëDriven' possesses all the characteristics of a good old-fashioned summer blockbuster; i.e. bass-pounding music, great race sequences, women, loud and full and quick flashes, etc¬Ö (Fill characteristics according to action genre)¬Ödid I mention the women¬Öit still fails to deliver on the level a summer film should deliver. ¬ëDriven' which was scripted by Stallone himself focuses on the Cart Circuit of Professional racing. While first plans were made to go with the F1 Circuit, the producers of the film focused on the Cart Circuit, and the result is quit trivial at times. Surprisingly, Sly wrote himself as the lead supporting actor who must guide a troubled young   driver onto the path of glory ¬ñ does he succeed? If you are a movie fan, you already know the answer. As far as plot goes, the pacing of the movie simply revolves around filling screen time between each meticulously constructed, exquisitely shot race sequence.      Director Renny Harlin seems to convey the image that he wants to make a film that fans will remember as the definitive race film, yet, a filmmaker must remember that in order to make a great film, there must be some form of substance to remember it by. In no way am I ¬ëknocking' the film in a condescending manner, yet so much work was put on the race scenes that by the cgi (computer generated imagery)-filled climactic race, the intelligent movie goer will think to themselves, `Why am I caring who wins?' That is not to say that it is a horrible film, if Harlin intended on simply making a collage of the most pulse-pounding race scenes roughly strung together for a two-hour piece, he has succeeded. The scenes are incredibly well done, yet those scenes in question are the race sequences. (Look for the great sequence when the young driver, played by Kip Pardue, steals a Cart car and Stallone chases him through the Montreal Ville Marie Tunnel standing in for Chicago. This scene brings a whole new meaning to the term ¬ëunrealistic').      There are also solid attempts at working the tension between the characters, for example, the villainous driver Mo Brandenburg seems to be a weak rip-off of F1's Ferrari Champion Michael Schumacher, yet all this does not seem solid enough at crafting a good film that touches upon all facets required to make a great film. Furthermore, the women in this movie are completely useless. It seems as if these women were put in the film simply as an excuse for some previews to show a romantic side to the film. Truth is, every single woman in this film seems to be so conveniently placed within all these men's lives, that is seems completely ridiculous. One woman is a reporter, while the other the woman torn between two men. What the movie cannot hide is that these women have absolutely no point being there except for an excuse of somewhat of a romantic plot-twist. Therefore, has the summer movie season finally begun yet? No. ¬ëDriven' manages to disappoint on many levels but delivers on what it sets out to do ¬ñ it contains some great race scenes that are truly extraordinary. I wish I could say the same for the film, but unfortunately that is not the case.<br/><br/>

","...this movie would crash, full speed, into a nearby tree.  Renny Harlin is the real star.  He captures every angle imaginable of the sport, and I don't think he could've done a better job at bringing the audience INTO the arena. Some of the crash sequences are noticeably computer-generated, but still look visually impressive.  But off the track...this movie is horrible!  And worst of all, I have to place the blame on my man Sly, who gets such a bad rep by people who fail to realize he DID write all 5 ""Rocky"" movies.  Sly does have talent, and he's a terrific actor who can totally deviate from his Rambo persona.  But what was he thinking when he came up with such HORRENDOUS dialogue?!!!!  This is some of the worst dialogue I've seen EVER!!!  I've heard some who claim that Renny Harlin is known to make movies that are visually spectacular and lack a good script.  Well, ""Cliffhanger"" had a good script, ""Die Hard 2"" had a good script.  Harlin did whatever he could to dig this lifeless melodrama out of its deeper-than-deep ditch.  The actors deliver good, but overenthusiastic performances.  Watching Burt Reynolds and Stallone exchange cliched dialogue and screaming at the top of their lungs is hardly watchable.  You want a succint description of ""Driven""?  Imagine a soap opera...and insert auto racing.  There's your movie!  The subplots are in no way original, and have the intelligence of an old-time afternoon serial.  <br/><br/>My score:  5 (out of 10)"

So I watched the film and went through a dull introduction, didn't knew Joe Tanto was a former CART champion until I checked out IMDB. I did try to pay full attention but somehow I missed out the CART champion introduction. Erm please don't tell me that little small trophy he gave Jimmy Bly was his championship prize. Laughs.<br/><br/>Okay on the the story, it is far from great. The story doesn't keep me in suspense but I must say the acting and scripting was very acceptable. So that's the plus point. Remember that cool scene when Joe and Jimmy drove the F1s into the city? Very cool, enjoyed every part of it but how it ended? It became more like a childish act and why they weren't arrested for it.<br/><br/>Next thing are the races, they are too short which makes the title a second option. Too many crashes and wrecks was involved too, no that doesn't happen on F1 races every time but somehow they fooled my girlfriend. She went off reality and thought F1 racing is more like a destruction derby. Yes it adds to the flavor of the movie but I wasn't impressed by it. Jimmy had that accident and was ready to drive the next week, Memo's accident could have killed him almost instantly but he's gonna appear in 'Miracles can happen'.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is exciting at times after the long and dull introduction which wastes only time but not the detailed background of the characters.

","First of all. I made a mistake by recommending and defended this movie earlier I have now seen the light. I was so happy initially to see Hollywood make an action movie on my favorite sporting event auto racing but left sick to see how arcade-like this movie appeared.<br/><br/>I've always liked Sylvester Stallone and my admiration of his work would not be disputed because I love a lot of his work. I found him and Gina Gershon's characters to be the only redeemable in the entire film. But I am saddened to see in the database for this movie how he pocketed 20 million dollars on his work on this picture when the money could have been placed in much more needed places. Burt Raynold's character was virtually unbelievable. I think very few owners would even consider letting go of a rookie driver who has won races and challenged for the championship. Some of that money Sly made should have perhaps been in invested into one or two other more professional and passionate young actors and actresses. Namely Kip Pardue, who appeared more like a role in one of his low-budget Indie pictures where he trys to act but only acts like a pretty-boy, mindless clown. Note to KIP: Your Hollywood career might be operating in the fastlane for now but sooner or later you'll redline and that career will erupt streaming mere fragments like a co-lead in Driven behind as soon as audiences recognize you have no talent and no heart towards the key emphasis of this movie being racing. Someone who wouldn't kind getting his hands dirty would have made a far more acceptable choice rather than a born fashion model.<br/><br/>As for the plot of this movie one could call it clich√©d. I called it a rip-off. More than thirty years ago a movie called Grand Prix was made and was a hallmark of motorsport movies. Driven copied Grand Prix right from the wheel-to-wheel race to the finish right down to the love triangle between two drivers and a woman. This entire movie seemed to be been some unapproved 'Grand Prix' remake that failed to capture the danger and the thrill.<br/><br/>
Although, I feel some that some credit had to be given to the director for providing some original camera shots. My personal favorite shot was the shot created from the prospective of the driver's actual eyes. That view was probably the most inventive part of the movie.<br/><br/>However, I admired how the story continued to look at each driver as a rivel rather than an enemy. All and all I enjoyed the light-heartedness of the movie. Driven is quite a bit more PG-oriented and therefore it is a good picture for a family to watch. But I would recommend going to see a real CART race with real passionate drivers rather than this misguided movie."

","I believe it was Cyril Connolly who wrote: ""Those whom the Gods wish to destroy, they first call promising."" That could serve as a biographical note for that atypically famous Finn, Renny Harlin. Who can forget our excitement at his early mainstream work- ""Die Hard 2"", ""Cliffhanger""- the former used its airport setting as an effective backdrop for the film's themes of desperation and commuter anomie; the latter shot the Dolomites as if they were the craggy faces of old-style film stars. Each boulder was Gary Cooper. The trees ceased to be wooden. Sylvester Stallone could not compete.<br/><br/>So, it is with sadness that I confirm that 'Driven' is a monstrous, stinkingly bad film in which the values of the race-car world (so movingly explored in the illustrious 'Days of Thunder') are ignored completely in favour of some limp car chases. It is telling that the romantic subplot from Tony Scott's film stays fresh over the years, its dialogue indelible on the mind, while in comparison we cringe at the related efforts in 'driven'. All Estella Warren manages to do throughout the film's entire running time is pout, like a paralysed goldfish.<br/><br/>Avoid."

Gina Gershon, Estella Warren and Stacy Edwards are all given pointless roles; in particular Gina Gershon, who has to wait 49 minutes into the film to have her first line (and all she ends up doing is shamelessly sashaying around, vamping it up for the cameras since Stallone nor Harlinhave thought it through exactly what her character's motivations are supposed to be).<br/><br/>Not enough action on the race track. Everything off of it is dullsville, and even when the movie switches to the track, only one chase is particularly exciting.<br/><br/>Stallone should be stopped from writing, starring in or directing any movies from here on out."

","Oh good lord!  The first movie I've seen in months and I feel like I need to baptize my eyes with fire just for seeing it.  Folks, this is just about as bad as it gets.  With a plot looser than Jenna Jameson and characters flatter than paper, this movie is the epitome of Hollywood trash. Everything about this movie scapes the bottom of the barrel in filmmaking and even just story telling.  There is no clear antagonist, the closest thing to a developed main character is Pardue's part Jimmie Bly, but that's even a far cry from anything decent.  The script sux, the directorialship sux, the acting sux, the editing sux.  One of the only redeeming quality of this movie is that apparently Fiore (the cinematographer) was given a huge budget and free reign to ""play"" with his shots.  Even he muffs this up by giving us all of his ""money shots"" about 20 times over apeice.  The other redeeming quality (although this is kindof a double edged sword) is that they bought up enough songs to make a triple disc soundtrack.  This, however, leads to three quarters of the movie being told through musical montages with little to no dialogue.<br/><br/>In summary, this movie isn't worth the pop and popcorn I ate while watching it.

","If you invite a bunch of friends over for a movie party, but the night is getting a little old and you want to subtly kick everyone out, pop in Renny Harlin's Driven.  A recent viewing I witnessed resulted in more than half the audience leaving before it was over.  Only four people made it all the way through.  Of course, those four felt extremely rewarded.  For you see, although Driven fails to achieve most of its goals, it succeeds on other levels.<br/><br/>Before the film even starts, its hero, Jimmy Bly (Kip Pardue, a name that would better serve a game show host) is wracked with self-doubt.  He's the greatest rookie Indycar driver ever, so naturally he's upset about how horrible his fantastic life is.  Pardue spends this portion of the movie pouting and playing with his hair.  <br/><br/>Joe Tanto (Sylvester Stallone) was a great driver, but then he freaked out, but now he's better, so he's brought in by Bly's mentor Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds) to play Mickey to Bly's Rocky.  They spout dialogue about driving for fun, and losing fear, and finding fear, and losing driving, and fearing finding fun, and all sorts of very deep, philosophical materials.  They also share a chase through the Chicago streets in 200 mph Indycars.  Of course this behavior has absolutely no repercussions whatsoever.<br/><br/>By explaining the plot in large detail, I might actually be doing the movie a disservice, for, upon viewing, it feels like the creators didn't much pay attention to silly trifles like ""plot"" or ""conflict.""  Essentially every scene is a car racing scene or a setup for more racing; and even crucial scenes that expound on the multi-faceted relationships of the race car drivers take place at tracks.  Don't these guys have homes?  Or at least hotel rooms?<br/><br/>If the plot had been terrible, it would have been enough.  But what in the world was Stallone thinking when he made a movie without a single antagonist?  European driver Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger) seems like a villain, but he repents his ways thanks to Stallone's teachings, and instead of fights or even races, people settle their differences in taut, riveting apologies.  Burt Reynolds has a few scenes where he yells, but by the end he's cheering alongside everyone else as our three heroes are showering each other in champagne.<br/><br/>If the characters had been terrible, it would have been enough.  But what in the world was Renny Harlin doing editing his movie like a two hour commercial for Nextel, Motorola, and women's behinds?  Scenes are chopped up and filled with jump cuts, the cinematography is blown out and overexposed, and the editing frequently jumps the line of action.  It seems like Harlin saw a few too many Steven Soderbergh movies and tried to emulate. <br/><br/>
Stallone's already applied the Rocky formula has been applied to Broadway dancing and arm wrestling, and in Driven it gets applied to Indycar racing with rather weak results.  It's no wonder it got nominated for all those Razzies; this movie is a tremendously successful failure."

Harlin did well I think with the humorous `Pirate's Cove,' with his wife. He seemed centered, sure. And though racing is rather like `professional' wrestling (but with more stickers and girls), I think it has great cinematic possibilities.<br/><br/>Alas, the breakthrough racing film has yet to be made.

The cut scenes and commentary show that this was supposed to be a racing version of ""Rocky."" All kinds of deep dialogue and development of not only characters, but individual relationships was cut because the Director wanted to dedicate more time to the race scenes and slow-motion shots. No wonder this film seemed hollow. Some scenes just made no sense regardless, but I now know that some of them didn't make sense because the backstory that would've made it make sense was cut.

","Fast cars and racing is usually an exciting activity. There's lots of energy surrounding the sport and octane only amps it up to intense levels. That's the kind of feeling a viewer should get when watching a film related to such an activity. At least, that's what one would think. It can be confusing when the opposite occurs because it just doesn't seem to fit at all. In that case someone should have said that to the people behind the production of this movie. Sadly, the early 2000s was not kind to Sylvester Stallone who stars in this feature. And this one is quite possibly the reason why nothing worked out right, because, this film is just boring. Kind of shocking when it's directed by Renny Harlin, who has worked with Stallone before.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Jimmy Bly (Kip Pardue), a rookie racer who's making his way up to the big leagues and may have the chance at winning the world competition. Managing him from behind is Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds) and his brother Demille (Robert Sean Leonard). Looking to win as well is Bly's competitor Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger). Both Brandenburg and Bly begin to lose focus of their goals when they get caught up between one girl, Sophia (Estella Warren). Noticing the slips, Henry calls in Joe Tanto (Sylvester Stallone) to get Bly back on track before he ruins his upcoming major break. The screenplay was also written by Stallone, and whatever he did, did not make much sense at all. The focus of the story is very much generic and bland.<br/><br/>Aside from this main thread, Tanto also has a subplot going on about him between an old flame Cathy (Gina Gershon) and a reporter he begins talking to named Lucretia (Stacy Edwards). Unfortunately, this doesn't really go anywhere because the old flame already has a new main squeeze; Memo (Cristi√°n de la Fuente). The biggest issue with this film's story is the pacing. The movie isn't overly long in reality but majority of it feels like an eternity. Renny Harlin should know better, but the story just drags. Most of the main leads do not help in making it any more watchable. The only character to actually feel worth rooting for is Til Schweiger's character. Partly because he's the one has an interesting arc, while the others don't. Kip Pardue is as lifeless as they come and some of his character's decisions make no sense.<br/><br/>It's even worse when veteran actors like Burt Reynolds and Sylvester Stallone are not even a highlight to the picture. They really have no charisma to their characters at all, which is sad to see. The love triangle between the Stallone and Pardue characters are clich√© and overdone. It's just baffling to think this is still a thing. Not even the racing scenes are that entertaining. While there is some tension on what'll happen to certain characters, much of it is flat and random. Again, this is disappointing when Renny Harlin and Sylvester Stallone both have worked together and have done action before. There are crash and burns, but it has no weight almost all the time.<br/><br/>Then again, half the time those scenes weren't very clear because the editing team on this feature butchered it so haphazardly. There are scenes in consecutive order where they are different angles of the same shot. It is bizarre to watch. Thankfully the cinematography shot by Mauro Fiore looked professional. Fiore who would also be a cameraman for Get Carter (2000), Smokin' Aces (2006), Avatar (2009), The A-Team (2010) and Southpaw (2015), makes the scenes filmed look decent enough. This doesn't take away though from composer BT's stock score to the film. Even if BT has the skills to produce complex synthesized music, here it's not very prevalent. Oh well BT, maybe film scores aren't your thing.<br/><br/>Cinematography and literally one character stand out as the things to like with this film. The action isn't anything special, the cast of actors are not impressive with their performances and the story is a giant snooze fest. That's rough considering it involves high speed vehicles."

","If you can get through the first five minutes of this dope, I applaud you. Between the distorted images, upside down, the infernal flashes and inverted editing, the cinematography is as good as any bottom feeder could have made it. This thing, is so poorly filmed it's atrocious. Did the producers look at it at some point before ever releasing it ? Because it's bad. It's about as bad of shot movie as there is alongside phone-filmed 2016 Ben-Hur. <br/><br/>The plot, is absent. The characters are stereotyped, the dialogues have no substance, the racing is science fiction, at no point is the movie ever really about racing and I'm not sure it was about anything. It's not about relationships, not about business, or laws of gravity, it's just a silly flick I guess is aired around 11 pm. The names of the protagonists look like they were stolen out of a you know what kind of R-rated movie.Jesus could you find more tacky than Jimmy Bly and Joe Tanto ? The cast is awful, either too old or too inexperienced, too difficult to understand as well -- hey here's a thing, if you're hiring a german actor, can you actually find one that SOUNDS english ? I'm sorry but you can't hire an actor with an english as bad as Til Schweiger, poor guy could hardly speak. Stallone, look, I don't understand what he's saying. I really can't. I have no idea what he saying half the time. 
But between the flying cars (which would immediately postpone the race), the drivers saving themselves from a car accident in a lake, seeing fans on a podium and then seeing them again on a podium in Tokyo (what? the chick was hot, not hard to recognize even at the back), go-fast around Chicago in a champ car without a helmet on and infested with subplots that go nowhere to a disjointed ending. 
This is why you can't hire an acting crew and think you're going to kick-butt because they're all good looking. Guess what ? They're all good looking in the movie business ! You cannot direct a movie this way. You need actors who have charisma, know their role and can act. Driven doesn't provide that and instead proceeds itself in laugher. We know the theme, the old veteran who grooms the young kid, that was done years ago in Bull Durham. The movie is built too much around clips, quick shots of car girls, overview shots, because the content is too poor and goes missing. The CGI are obvious, champ cars do not crash like that or float over water by the way. The champ car staff is so awkward, there doesn't seem to be a trainer in there, only agents and girlfriends and again too many shots of beautiful women it's an invasion.
None of these actors really show any skill or belief in their part, haven't heard Pardue do anything since that, Stallone did additional garbage and the rest vanished off. You don't understand the purpose in this junk, wether relationships or sportsmanship, you don't get i. Between that and the horrible soundtrack picked by a teenage 13 year old, you don't get it. The ex-wive comes off as spiteful but apparently everybody in the movie points to Tanto being the loser and the sabotage artist. You don't get anything from this movie. <br/><br/>At least it's great for advertising."

","Continuing my plan to watch every Sly Stallone movie in his filmography in order, I come to 2001's Driven.<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Talented young race-car driver Jimmy Bly (Kip Pardew) has started losing his focus and begins to slip in the race rankings. With much riding on Bly, car owner Carl Henry (a delightful Burt Reynolds) brings former racing star Joe Tanto (Stallone) on board to help Bly. <br/><br/>Once again (as with Get Carter) Sly wanted to make a character driven movie like Copland. What he ended up with was almost a supporting role in his own melodramatic soap opera. <br/><br/>His original script was 220 pages long, and according to director Renny Harlin's commentary, his first cut of the movie was 4 hours long. It's amazing he thought what was here, made the best movie. The 51 minutes of deleted footage included as special feature on DVD show a much better movie was left on the cutting room floor. <br/><br/>Rumour has it, the studio had lost confidence in Sly's ability to open a movie as the lead, and had a lot of his scenes cut, with more more focus put on the younger supporting characters. It's to the movies detriment Harlin went along with this, as Sly is the best thing in the movie. <br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, with the exception of Burt Reynolds, Til Schweiger and Brent Briscoe the supporting cast are awful Kip Pardew isn't as bad as Robert Sean Leonard, Cristian De La Fuente, Gina Gerahon and Stacy Edwards but he is bad enough. <br/><br/>The coin trick scene is one of the coolest things in a Sly movie. However the car chase in the streets of Chicago, using the racing cars is one of the silliest things In any of Sly's movies. <br/><br/>I think if Sly directed this movie himself, it may have turned out very differently, as listening to his commentary on the DVD, you can tell he is dissatisfied that some good character driven scenes were cut. He later reused some of these ideas in 'Rocky Balboa'. My advice is to check out the deleted scenes on the DVD to see what could have been.<br/><br/>Stallone was asked in an interview about films he would wish had not done, and along with 'Rhinestone' and 'Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot', he listed this as one of them."

","You can tell this film was originally meant for F1; they want the exotic locations (Japan, Germany, etc), glitz and glamour, while keeping the down to earth appeal of American open top racing. It could have been a decent racing film if it had been more about the whole races, and less about just the main characters. Instead, it feels more like a real life version of Pixars Cars. There are plenty of crashes through out the film, but - apart for the main characters - they just seem to be excuses for pretty CGI; there seems to be no reactions from the cast or crowd when it happens. One car spins and another goes air borne over it, is just a throwaway piece. Cars smash and disintegrate without much impact on the race. For a film about the camaraderie of racers, it seems lacking in drivers; it's more a back drop for the boxing style machismo of the named actors. It's Sylvester Stallones film; he's the old racer, come back to mentor the young upstarts. They do dumb, hot head things and he tries to rein them in. I'm so glad they made Rush."

","Driven (2001): Dir: Renny Harlin / Cast: Sylvester Stallone, Kip Pardue, Estella Warren, Burt Reynolds, Gina Gershon: Scene after scene of speeding around a track and wrecking automobiles in gushing style. Title refers to persistence and endurance both professionally and emotionally. Kip Pardue is the headline race car driver who loses his championship and wipes out several times due to pressure. Burt Reynolds plays the big promoter who summons Sylvester Stallone to whip him into shape. Director Renny Harlin often partakes in big budget spectacles such as Cutthroat Island, and here he employs every stereotype within reach. The concept is a yawner structured around repetitious race action including a pointless race about the city streets. Stallone is flat in what appears to be a tailor made role. Pardue has potential but he is in the wrong movie. He plays a guy dealing with the wrong woman and a declining track record. Reynolds's role is thankless and only serves as a reminder that viewers should be watching Smokey and the Bandit instead of this road kill. Estella Warren is given a role that is the equivalent to a male fantasy. Gina Gershon is also wasted here although perhaps had she played the lead female then perhaps it might have had better clout on that end. While the race action is exhilarating, the screenplay is produced into a a film that will likely drive viewers to sleep. Score: 3 / 10"

","The Wizard of Oz is more rooted in reality than this piece of garbage from the pen of Sly Stallone. At least aware that he's no longer young enough to play the male lead, he gives himself a supporting role which somehow manages to bag more screen time than the nominal leads ‚Äì Til Schweiger and some other guy ‚Äì who play a pair of racing drivers vying for the driving championship of one of those sports that looks suspiciously like Formula One but isn't. Stallone's character is called in as back up to the other guy's challenge. (I can't remember the guy's name, and the blandness of both his features and his performance mean I can't really be bothered to look him up). Anyway, this guy's a from-out-of-the-blue rookie who's suddenly suffering from the wobbles with the finishing line in sight. There's a few women involved, but they're just there to pad out the running time and deflect the possibility of anybody detecting a homoerotic undertone.<br/><br/>Renny Harlin's direction is in-your-face flashy, replete with wandering shaky-cam shots, astonishing high-speed prangs that send wheels and stuff hurtling skywards, and two dozen cuts during any thirty-second conversation. He does manage to conjure up a couple of moments of tension, but the impression is that he's adopting all these razzle-dazzle techniques in a futile attempt to divert your attention from the dull plot and asinine script.<br/><br/>Ah yes, the script¬Ö <br/><br/>If I wrote this review with the same care and skill as Stallone wrote the screenplay for Driven, it would read something like this: The script was bad. I did not like the script. I wish the script was better because I did not like the script. It made me sad. Why do they make scripts like this? It made me sleepy. Find yourself. A talented cast would have struggled to mine anything of worth from this rubbish but this lot are hardly A-list: A German star speaking his second language, a model turned actress, the aforementioned bland guy whose name I've chosen to forget. Burt Reynolds shows his commitment to bankruptcy by playing the hard-as-nails crippled manager of the racing team from behind the plastic mask that became his face sometime in the mid-1990s ‚Äì but he at least gets to sit down throughout and has at least a functional acting technique."

There is a lame romantic subplot involving Sophia Simone (Warren) and it causes more animosity with Beau and Bly.<br/><br/>While this is not a straight to video release, it sure looks like one. For example when Tanto is racing, he runs over CGI quarters that look awful and it is hilarious. The racing sequences leave a lot to be desired and apes ""Days Of Thunder"" (1990). There is pervasive product placement throughout the movie. It is basically a 2-hour commercial for Nextel and Target.com among many others.<br/><br/>There are numerous dialogue scenes between Tanto and Beau which are nigh-unintelligible because Sly slurs his speech and Til has a heavy German accent.<br/><br/>This nonsense was written by Stallone (including all the funny names) and a lot of plot items make no sense or are not fully thought through.<br/><br/>I guess Carl has a past with Joe Tanto and he forces him to mentor Bly with the line: ""We go back, you and me.

","For the past few years M. Night Shymalan's ""Signs"" has been my personal choice for the title of ""worst movie ever made"", but all of that changed when I watched ""Driven"". <br/><br/>Where to begin? The script for this movie is unbelievably bad. The main conflict driving the narrative is basically that if rookie Jimmy Bly doesn't win the championship, the team owner played by Burt Reynolds is going to cut him loose. This is beyond ridiculous. In the world of open-wheel racing, for a rookie to finish on just one single podium in a season would constitute a successful year! Stallone also (of course) throws in a love-triangle in an attempt to spice things up, but since it was never even clear whether Bly and Warren consummated their relationship the culmination of the storyline where she ""breaks up"" with him doesn't make much sense except in retrospect. There's not even a real antagonist in this film, as the racer who at the beginning appears to be it eventually comes a sympathetic character.<br/><br/>Now, you might think this is one of those movies that you can enjoy as long as you just sit back and watch the action scenes. Well, in Driven you can't, because apparently the director lacked the skill to make an authentic, exciting race scene, so we're subject to absolutely ridiculous crashes (""several cars involved!"" squeal the announcers) that are laugh-out-loud funny to anybody remotely familiar with open-wheel racing.<br/><br/>The much-talked about street race is the most engaging part of the film, as ridiculous as it may be, but even still is hampered by the fact that there's no real point to it. Where is Jimmy Bly trying to go? It makes no sense. It culminates with an atrociously written scene between Tanto and Bly (""YOU DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE ANYMORE!"") and absolutely no legal repercussions for the two characters.<br/><br/>I don't throw around the ""Worst Movie Ever"" label often, but after you watch Driven, you'll be hard pressed not to join me."

To put it most succinctly, this movie was a two hour beer commercial, with scene after scene of loud noises and attractive people smiling. It assaults your senses in a way that only appeals to preadolescent boys, or men that ceased growing intellectually after the 7th grade. After the movie I headed straight for the mountains of Busch; and not because of the subliminal association to coors or budweiser, but in an attempt to kill the brain cells that were harboring the wasteful and trite images that Sly produced. I would rip the plot, but I was not able to identify one concretely. I would rip the writing, but this review is likely longer than the script. I am sorry Sly, but this movie is an insult to the sensibilities of the American people and it makes me curious as to where Rocky actually came from.

"pierotti","Null","1","2","4 August 2004"," Little heart and no soul
","I find myself perplexed by the hostile comments concerning Estella Warren's character, Sophia Simone, in Driven. Ms. Warren was chosen for this role because she fit the character, i.e. the type of model/minor actress that often hang around race car drivers. She was given the thankless task of having to play off two very wooden actors in Schweiger and Pardue, who seem to be obsessed with one another in a sort of odd homoerotic subtext. Other than her role as beard to these two, Estella's role in Driven is to stand around looking concerned, which she does reasonably well, especially considering this was her first major film role. <br/><br/>Sophia is given no backstory. Apparently she is a synchronized swimmer, which is the only thing that could explain her swimming pool scene, which is esthetically lovely but unrelated to the plot. Incidentally, that pool scene is the only scene in the entire film with believable emotions, which makes me suspect that it was not written by Stallone, and may even have been improvised. Not surprisingly, this scene is often left out of Driven when it is shown on TV. Thus the only scene in the movie with a discernible heart is removed, leaving the film even more cold and empty than it already is.<br/><br/>The problems with Driven is that is all about special effects, but pretends to be about human beings. Stallone has been milking the Rocky formula endlessly, and does so again, stressing male competition as a form of bonding. No female character in a Stallone film is ever allowed to do anything but look worshipfully at the male characters, waiting patiently for them to come to her, if they survive. In that pool scene Ms. Warren does something unique for a female in a Stallone film. She shows that a female character has a skill and a life outside of, and independent of, the male characters. The hard thing for me to accept is that a woman of such skill and beauty would ever allow a man to tell her she is just ""a distraction"" in his life and have anything to do with him ever again. <br/><br/>Overall, Driven is a fairly dull and pedestrian movie. It is not the worst film ever made, but it is what one would expect from a collaboration between Sylvester Stallone and Renny Harlin, two self important males with large egos and small talent. Neither has ever made a film with any real soul. Who would expect anything different when they work together?"

Joe Tanto(Sylvester Stallone) is brought back to help Bly capture the title before the rookie crumbles.<br/><br/>And that's really the side-plot to ""Driven"". This movie really feels more like a ""racing-love"" story. Instead of focusing on the racing side, ""Driven"" thinks you'll get more out it's relationships. For this to work, there has to be some good acting and decent dialoge. Unfortunatley we get decent acting and awful dialoge. The first interaction between Sly and Gina Gershon displays some of the most gut-wrenching things I've ever heard on screen. Not to down Gina, but everytime she's on screen, her dialoge is atrocious, and giving you more reason to hate her character. The same could be said for Estella Warren. At least Gershon tried to bring some life to her character, as Estella brings almost none to Sophia. There are very few decent scenes with her, but they're so far and between you barely notice them.<br/><br/>Another point this movie fails on is character development. Not to say the characters aren't developed, but paper thin. All you know about Tanto's past is that he did something, yet the film never gives us any indication as to what it was except Burt Reynolds' Carl Henry can no longer walk. One thing really hurting the movie is believability. We know Brandenburg and Bly are in a points race, but does that need to be displayed every race with the two finishing first and second? The announcers are so stereotypical it's embarrassing. They sprout every cliche in the book, and making the viewer turn their face in disgust.<br/><br/>If you can get past the unbelievability, you'll discover the racing sequences aren't bad at all. I liked the ""coin-trick"" run and the ""Chicago street race"" may have one flaw to it, but it's still fun and interesting to watch. The final race should have been more, as it loses it's steam once the CGI makes it's way on. That's another strike, the CGI. It's passable in some scenes, but in others its downright disgraceful.<br/><br/>All in all, Driven just barely settles for ok. If they hadn't focused too much on relationship-development and paid attention to character-development, they might've had something.<br/><br/>5 out of 10"

Much of the racing footage is impressive.<br/><br/>But the film makes all the mistakes racing movies make - the driver rivalry over a girl (which never happens in real life); the racing footage that is always quick-cut montages, never the very-long takes that are vital to communicating the essence of racing (racing is never about quick-cut montages); the use of real life announcers as if race teams ever pay any attention to their commentaries (let alone even hear them); the preposterous crashes; the preposterous driving maneuvers; the preposterous shortness of the races portrayed (why can a racing movie never show a race in its entirety - all 200 laps or whatever distance?), and so on.

Unfortunately, this racing saga remains stuck in low gear for its entire duration.<br/><br/>My first objection to this movie is that its opening race is presented with such music video-style editing and breathless narration that for me it's obnoxious, not thrilling: it never really explains what's happening, or why I should care; and all the movie's racing sequences are presented in the same tiresome hyper-kinetic fashion.<br/><br/>I also hated the cheesy special effects, which in my opinion are ludicrous and unconvincing computer-generated f/x even compared to the shoddy f/x of other recent movies.  The sight of one race-car spinning in mid-air (in slow motion, of course) while the other cars zoom beneath it like flashes of light is simply stupid and weird to the point of distraction: it contributes nothing to the so-called story, and serves as nothing more than a completely redundant and gratuitous imitation of The Matrix's famously stylish ""bullet-time"" sequence.  I felt embarrassed watching this movie, with its obviously computer-generated quarters, manhole covers and even individual raindrops, none of which serve any useful purpose: I honestly believe the movie would have been better with no computer-generated images whatsoever; certainly I would have hated it less.<br/><br/>Some of the acting scenes are even worse than the racing segments!  The first Big Emotional Moment comes from Estella Warren, whose ""performance"" is awful; no, make that AWFUL!  She deservedly won a Razzie Award for her atrocious attempt to become another model-cum-thespian.  Hollywood movies frequently showcase pretty girls with little talent, but she's bad even compared to others of her type: she makes Jennifer Love Hewitt look like Meryl Streep.<br/><br/>Stallone's performance is, in my opinion, the least objectionable in the entire movie: his pleasant, easygoing screen presence easily carries him through most of his scenes, and he seems subtle and relaxed compared to some of the other actors.  Burt Reynolds gives his usual Burt Reynolds performance, though his unflattering facelift (caused by an unsuccessful visit to Cher's plastic surgeon, perhaps) attracted my notice more than his acting.  His big emotional scene with Sly is thus rendered laughable: the only image more ridiculous than Reynolds's face is watching him try to act with it.<br/><br/>Not much plot to reveal, certainly not much worth mentioning: Stallone's character, a fallen legend among race-car drivers, is called in to help promising young driver Jimmy Bly, played by Kip Pardue, whose name reminds me of meaty chicken.  Pardue's performance is so uneven that it's difficult to evaluate: at times he seems sensitive and appealing, at other times he seems as argumentative and unsympathetic as the other characters.  He's supposed to be the lead, and yet he doesn't have enough charisma or personality to compete as an actor with Stallone or the others.  Til Schweiger, by comparison, as Jimmy Bly's rival Beau Brandenburg, has a powerful screen presence, and consequently I found him somewhat appealing despite the fact that he plays a stereotypically cold-blooded German.<br/><br/>Robert Sean Leonard is intolerably obnoxious and headache-inducing as Jimmy Bly's agent (and brother!): I understand that his character is supposed to be annoying, but a better actor would have been able to project an irritating character without becoming irritating himself.  Gina Gershon is the only other member of the cast worth mentioning, because her ugly, sneering mouth constantly distracted me during her scenes: some people believe she's attractive despite that mouth, but not me.  Some people also believe she's a good actress, but not me.<br/><br/>Renny Harlin has directed at least two movies that I genuinely like, Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea; neither movie is very good, exactly, but both at least are energetic and have a sense of fun.  The chief failure of Driven is that very few of its scenes, if any, have any energy or real sense of fun.  It feels too clumsy to be much fun, as it continually shifts from dizzying (and ultimately numbing) racing sequences to static scenes in which uninteresting characters exchange dialogue that is too trite to be memorable.  Driven could have succeeded in several ways (as a true documentary-style movie, or as an old-fashioned action movie using real cars and stunt people instead of laughable f/x), but in its present form it's too much of a hybrid to succeed as either an action movie or a drama.<br/><br/>
POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>The final race is so predictable that there's no excuse for it dragging out as long as it does.  Did Harlin think he was building suspense?  Did anyone who watched this movie from the beginning seriously doubt that Jimmy Bly would win the final race?  Or that Reynolds would hurry up to Stallone after the race and say ""You could have won that race!"", and that Stallone would say ""I did win it!"" because he proved something to himself?  (Everybody say ""Aww."")  Or that all the characters would be cheering the winners, their petty problems reconciled?  Or that the three winners would spray each other with champagne while a generic feel-good song plays on the soundtrack?  Or that the movie would end with a freeze-frame of the winners smiling in triumph?  Was anyone seriously surprised by any of this?<br/><br/>Had the filmmakers edited out most of Estella Warren's atrocious performance, and made the car crashes realistic and exciting rather than laughable and unconvincing, I might have given this movie my ""okay"" rating of 5; but they did not, so I give it my ""below average"" rating of 4.  To be fair, Driven is not terrible, but most of it is made unwatchable by the aforementioned weaknesses.  I felt compelled to write this comment not because my opinion differs from all the other negative reviews, but because I squandered almost two hours of my life watching this mindless, smug, unfocused and (worst of all) pointless and forgettable movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 4"
"Evil_Will_Hunting","4","1","2","10 December 2002"," Stallone makes pun, race car movie
","5 out of 10<br/><br/>Somewhere between 'drivel' and 'writhing' lies `Driven,' the film conceived, written, funded, starring, and screened in select cities by Sylvester Stallone.  Yeah, that's right, if you scratch the right combo off your popcorn box, old Sly'll even come home with you and wash your damn car. Here's a plot summary, comin' at ya'.  [Note: for full effect, open a window near a construction zone, shake computer screen violently and ogle women with your other eye.]<br/><br/>Stallone stars as Joe Tanto, sage old race car expert who `threw it all away' when he was young.  Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds) calls him in to star in his own movie, the Renny Harlin film `Driven,' and also to give moral support to the `next big thing' in Cart racing, Jimmy Blye (Kip Pardue, or if my suspicions are correct, an uncredited Beck).<br/><br/>Part of the 'it' that Stallone `threw all away' was his wife, Cathy (Gina Gershon, `Showgirls! Showgirls! Showgirls!'), who left him for fellow racer Memo Moreno (Cristi√°n de la Fuente, People magazine's `Sexiest Man Ever'). There are no hard feelings between the two racers, but that doesn't keep Gershon - who really should consider getting the ends of her mouth soldered shut, if not the whole damned thing - from snipping out every other line through that insipid beak of hers.<br/><br/>Blye is overwhelmed by his team's high expectations for him, as well as by his love interest, Sophia Simone (Estella Warren), who still has feelings for rival driver Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger, the foreign guy with the temper from `SLC Punk').<br/><br/>Yadda yadda yadda, some other stuff happens, people get mad and say stuff they don't mean, and in the end they all kiss and make up.  The film is not without a thorough plot.  But oh, the driving!  The smashing and the fuel! The adrenaline and the fast editing!  It's almost sexual, you think.<br/><br/>Actually there's no almost about it.  A healthy dose of street-pilfered, imported erotica is subliminally injected a la `Fight Club' into virtually every collage featured in `Driven.'  I am not making this up.  Sure, it seems normal at first, until you analyze it, frame by frame.  Cars fueling up.  Sweaty men in helmets.  Breast shot.  Guy at hot dog stand.  Close up of car wheel.  Hawaiian Tropic girls seducing the camera.  Kid eating his first churro.<br/><br/>Of course, eye candy abounds even despite the obligatory T&A.  To its credit, `Driven' does feature some amazing visual effects for its driving and especially its crash sequences. The actual races play out like `Star Wars' in Formula One race cars, with Stallone alternately playing Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda.  `Special I am not,' he says at one point.  You just can't make that kind of stuff up.<br/><br/>`Driven' is not 'bad' in any formal sense of the word, save perhaps Gershon's one note performance.  The plot, the acting, and the character development are all very, well, adequate.  Director Renny Harlin, whose credits include `Die Hard 2,' `Cliffhanger,' and `Deep Blue Sea,' shovels out a pretty consistent slab of lukewarm mediocrity for the masses. It's not `Rocky' or `Rambo,' but `Driven' is sure to satisfy its target audience - horny, burnt out ex-race car drivers.  And even if that equates to no one else but Stallone and his immediate family, in lick some sense I still boobies consider that to be a marginal success."

","DRIVEN is bad film, and it's a shame that it's such a bad film. It is comprised of stale themes and painfully predictable ""plot twists"" that are barely interesting (and nearly all were present in DAYS OF THUNDER),all being performed by<br/><br/>characters that are so wooden that you can't care about them even a little. That is, except for Stallone's character. Sly pulls of a decent acting job in this film and does the best that he could with the rather weak dialogue he had.<br/><br/>Stallone seems to have grown in his capabilities as an actor and it is clear he doesn't always want to play the hero role any longer as his roles in DRIVEN and COPLAND indicate. It's a shame that Sly can't pick his vehicles for his new take on acting more carefully. He should stay away from stale, been-there-done-that films and concentrate on more edgy indie style themed films if he wants to<br/><br/>regain the respect of the film world that he lost after Rocky."
"Rick1948","3","1","2","6 December 2002"," You know you are watching a bad movie when Sly Stallone stands out.
","I like motor racing movies.  Generally they are entertaining with some excitement mixed in.  This movie, however, is terrible.  I rated it a three only because the special effects (crashes) were interesting.  You know you are watching a bad movie when Sylvester Stallone gives the best performance of the bunch. Nothing makes much sense about this movie.  It would have helped to develop Burt Reynold's character a little more.  He seemed to be the one with the most appeal.  But no way were we going to find out about him and why he was such a hard ass.  No, we had to make sure that the blond puffy lips got more screen time than the actual racing."
"cbrandt86","1","1","2","21 November 2002"," Wasted ideas and an F1 abortion ","The concept of a movie about the thrills of the F1 racing circuit sure sounds good, but the subsequent screenplay is the pits.  Not the F1 pits, but pits as in yuck.  The screenplay tries to combine action and drama, and in the process woefully falls short on both fronts.  Its a pity really, because the logline's good, the racing circuit badly needed a film made about it, and some shots in the movie are intrepid enough to suggest the promise of something better, that eventually never quite materialised.<br/><br/>The scene showing the F1 cars on the streets of Chicago was brilliant, but all too brief.  Hey guys, you've got the concept of F1 cars in a regular street correct; and this is an action movie about racing cars, so what you need to show is a real prolonged [prooolllooonnnggeed, get it] chase scene, complete with cops and outsiders joining the melee, hyperstressed street sequences, and something great emerging at the end.  What we get instead is a few seconds of street circuitry, and then the cars stop, the two guys step out, have an emotional interaction, and period, full-stop.  ""Last Action Hero"" may not have fared all that well, but its car chase scene was brilliant, and miles ahead of this F1 abortion compiled by Stallone.<br/><br/>The special effects of cars flying through the air, breaking up in mid-air, the tyre falling on the spectators' gallery; all of these stand out, that is, stand out as inserted special effects.  All of these pictures show a computer gleam that's lacking in the background.  That's the special effects goof up.<br/><br/>Not that the direction is in any way special.  I always had the desire to watch the innards of a racing car and its dashboard, and hoped this movie would do so at least for a minute or so.  Unfortunately, they missed out on such a simple task.  Then, there's the background commentary.  It sounds just like any other character on screen, whereas they ought to have displayed its distinctiveness from the rest of the dialogue by getting a rapid-fire commentator, of whom there are quite a few.<br/><br/>The most disgusting fact about this whole business is that, as in real life when abortion often causes subsequent sterility; this F1 abortion may well have drawn the curtains on any future F1-based screenplay that could've incorporated the ingredients I have outlined above."

","I was really looking forward to this film.  I know that Stallone, who I am a big fan of by the way, spent a lot of time around the Formula 1 paddock, doing the background.  But I have to say it was a real let down.<br/><br/>The acting was wooden, the story was thin, and there were a lot of very obvious CG animated scenes.<br/><br/>I saw it as little more than a Formula one/ Indy car version of Days of Thunder, transposed over the Old hero/relic coming back to the fray for one last stand routine.<br/><br/>There was a section where there was a street race, in the race cars, which was a bit different, and that helped, although, with the cars needing a seperate starter to get going, I do wonder how they get started for the street race.<br/><br/>I do like Stallone, his films are always watchable, not masterpieces of cinematography, or intellectually challenging opuses, but they do entertain.<br/><br/>This one, I'm sorry to say, was pretty grim, and just scrapes to 4 out of 10.<br/><br/>One final point, to all producers, writers and directors, if you want to make a film about motor racing in Europe, a Ferrari or two wouldn't hurt, they were strangely missing from this one, though Mercedes (McClaren) were very evident"

","This movie is a complete and total disaster. From the insane dialogue, to the bad acting, to the completely unbelievable driving sequences, this movie is one for the ages. Perhaps the worst movie ever produced. And yes, I mean that.<br/><br/>There are many problems...I will name a few:<br/><br/><br/><br/>-- CART cars are designed so they DON'T flip. Very rarely will you see a crash bad enough to burst in flames, or flip, or land upside down in a pond. But this happens more than once in Driven! In fact, it happens again...and again...and again...<br/><br/>-- Where were the rescue workers when Moreno's car flipped? And if you expect me to believe two other drivers came to his rescue...God...do I even have to finish this sentence? This included Bly driving backwards down the track! Please...<br/><br/>-- The sequence where they take the cars out in the city is so utterly ridiculous, I'm just going to stop there.<br/><br/>-- There's a pit lane speed limit in CART. Apparently they forgot about it here...<br/><br/>-- At one point, Burt Reynolds' character says Jimmy has to win the next race or he's out. Hello?? This guy is in second place in the championship and he can't cut it? Give me a break...<br/><br/>-- The scene where Sly picks up the coins with his tires is laughable. I won't get into why that isn't possible...I don't have the time or effort to do so at the moment.<br/><br/>-- Gina Gershon and Estella Warren serve no purpose in this movie. They just annoyed the heck out of me...<br/><br/>-- There is no German or Japanese stop on the CART tour.<br/><br/>-- The points system is completely illogical in this movie. With all the races they show of Brandenburg winning and Bly not finishing, there's no way Jimmy would have a chance at winning the championship. Especially since Brandenburg won the first six races...<br/><br/>-- It's very rare that one team would have two different primary sponsors and i.e. two different cars. Not impossible...but I don't think there's a team on the current circuit who employs this method. But in this movie, I guess anything is possible.<br/><br/>-- Brandenburg is on the pole in every race. CART is very competitive and this is virtually impossible.<br/><br/>-- Bly winning from last place in the last race?? What a surprise...<br/><br/>Bottom Line:<br/><br/>SAVE YOUR MONEY. This is a complete waste of time...and if you're a racing fan, this movie will just make you shake your head. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this a -1."

Now I can understand why the rulers of F1 rejected him. The film lacks any kind of grounding in the real world.  The characters, while clearly based on real people, are totally unbelivable.  Team owner in a wheelchair, thats Frank Williams, but can you imagine Frank, or anyone else for that matter, behaving in the way Reynolds character does?  Bo Brandenberg, Michael Schumcher?  If I were Schumi I'd be offended.<br/><br/>The track sequences and crashes are laughable, the dialogue is a joke and I think any racing driver could expect slightly more than a $20k fine for driving a race car around the streets of Chicago.

For anyone that has watched Formula 1, I would like to say that we can't judge the amount of advertisements in this film, as that is what these car races are partly all about (plus the pretty girls as well), and without it, it would have looked fake.  Not to mention that much of the movie was filmed during actual races, giving it a realistic feel.  The script was nothing out of the ordinary, and had several clich√©s, but it didn't go complete by the formula though.  For example, we didn't have any Bad or Good guys, just ordinary people, making good or bad decisions.  The best part was that Sly was not a hero, but a burnout ¬ñ and known for it.  He was clumsy in his attempt to help the new guy, and displayed well that he wasn't all-knowing.  The race scenes were well done though a bit over the top on couple of occasions.

Its played deadly seriously, which is a shame, and for that reason alone this in a class with 'Showgirls', and Gina Gershon is aboard in case you want the movie to make the connection for you. <br/><br/>Highlights:<br/><br/>--Estella Warren is inexplicably always at the track, even though her main function is eye candy.  Why is she there?  Does she have an actual responsibility, or is she just 'the girl'?  Who paid for her to go to Tokyo, Germany, etc.?  Whose idea was it for her to water dance, and whose idea was it to linger on a shot of her feet?<br/><br/>--Stacy Edwards is also always at the track, even though she is just a reporter writing a story.  Is one magazine article enough of a reason to follow the race car circuit all around the world?  Why is she given communication with the racers while they are racing?  And why is her name Lucretia?<br/><br/>--Burt Reynolds recalls 'Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?', not because he's in a wheelchair, although he is, but because his make-up must have been put on a with a paintbrush, like Jane Hudson's was.  There are some very unflattering close-ups of Burt, too. You don't get a flashback story about why 'he's in that chair' but I would have killed to see him get tortured a little, just for fun, in a movie that provides the laughs anyway, just not outright. <br/><br/>--The trio of racers (Jimmy, Beau & Memo) look like they were filming a gay porn movie and accidentally stepped onto this set.  In some ways, this movie is porn-level in terms of acting and dramatic intensity.<br/><br/>
--Gina Gershon is just around to call everyone an a**hole, basically.  She is Sly's ex-wife and now married to Memo Moreno, a plastic name if there ever was one.  Gina breathes fire and has a semi-decent scene in a ladies room with Stacy in which they almost come to blows. It does not rival Patty Duke v. Susan Hayward in 'Valley of the Dolls', but she seems to know the whole thing is a lark so lets loose a little, which is appreciated in a movie where every actor onscreen is so constipated.<br/><br/>--To be fair, screenwriter Sly does not give himself all the big scenes, and does not make the victories his.  But the man responsible for so much bad dialogue at least had the sense to spread it around.  His race with Kip Pardue (Jimmy Bly), at 195 mph, through the streets of Chicago, is another highlight and the only time I laughed, and I laughed a lot.  A police officer clocks their speed but obviously was not concerned enough to follow them or anything.  Both men get hit with a fine of $25,000 but the Chicago cops had nothing to say about it at all.  Incredible. <br/><br/>Robert Sean Leonard is around to annoy everyone and to cause unnecessary dramatic conflict.  The slap he gets was from Estella was from the heart, I am sure.  <br/><br/>Originally I watched this only to see Kip, who played Sunshine in 'Remember the Titans' but I am glad I saw it, for its camp-value, ridiculous acting, dialogue cribbed from fortune cookies and bumper stickers, and for its throwback value.  Every generation seems to get a race car movie built around a soap opera - others are 'Bobby Deerfield', 'Grand Prix', 'Winning' and 'Days of Thunder', but they didn't have Stallone writing the script and Renny Harlin directing...luckily."

Some characters emotions (like Memo or his wife) are too emphasized and simple.<br/><br/>Where the movie gets really bad is the driving scenes. Maybe it could be interesting to someone who never saw a single car race but to someone who likes the sport its stupid. Cars flipping and flying like there is no gravity. Then we come to the final two races. It was sad to watch them. I mean a car flying of the road into a pond and there is nobody to help the guy for minutes. Come on. That could not happen 30 years ago. And finally the last race is pathetic. Even in cartoons the race does not develop like that. The driving scenes would maybe be appealing to a 6 year old.

Comedy would be the other route to success but this movie is serious drama action based on a bad script and directed by a horror oriented director HELP! The first 10 minutes were so awful clich√© porridge that I wanted to hide under my seat in shame.<br/><br/>If you want race track drama watch Days of thunder. If you want racing fun watch the Cannon ball runs. For crash FX just fast forward over this movies ""talky"" bits and your in for a treat."

The plot sucked, the acting was bad, the racing scenes were so ridiculous. I was embarrassed for the actors. I feel real sorry for Sylvester Stallone, this was his dream, and it definitely was not even close to the same level as the logical comparison, Days of Thunder. The music sucked, the acting sucked, the racing sequences made me laugh, the announcers I wanted to shoot. The effects were way too over the top, I felt that I was watching a video game. The only good part was the part that everyone has panned, the chase scene through Chicago. At least you knew this was not trying to be real. This is a good rental for a bunch of friends when you are all hammered. You should find it amusing. I still do like Sly however."

","How bad can big-budget Hollywood movies be?  See Driven to find out.  I should have loved this movie - I am a car fanatic and expected to be wowed by the racing.  However, piss-poor direction wins again.  (Note: possible spoilers in this review.)<br/><br/>Let's start with the computer-generated special effects.  In technical terms, they suck.  The worst is the flying tire that seemingly goes into a full Earth orbit before plummeting into the grandstands at supersonic speeds.  Thankfully in Driven racing spectators are able to dodge race car fragments at speeds faster than the cars themselves are capable of.  This scene is actually offensive given that fairly recently several people were killed at one race due to a flying wheel/tire.  The street racing between Stallone and Pardue is chock full of terrible special effects that erode the narrow thread of reality that was needed to support such a ludicrous scene anyway.  CART race cars do not have onboard starters for one.<br/><br/>Stallone is ok if a bit wimpy.  Kip Pardue is entirely unremarkable and not the least bit sympathetic - don't even get me started on perhaps the worst haircut since Tom Cruise in MI:2 or the fact that he spends the whole movie covered in a sheen of greasy sweat.  Estella Warren is beautiful yet underutilized (except in her magical ability to change shirts in a bar). Til Schweiger's Beau Brandenburg was far and away the most compelling figure in the movie.  Burt Reynolds came across as just over-dyed.<br/><br/>Abandon your intellect if you choose to see this movie.  Logic will just be a piece of cumbersome baggage in the theater.  I know if I was a team owner and my ROOKIE driver could ONLY manage to run neck and neck with the WORLD CHAMPION I would just have to cut him loose and find a new driver, too.  Yeah, right.  Of course, I too would stop and help rescue my fellow driver after a horrible wreck, because, yes, I am more highly trained in rescue procedures than all the track safety personnel, and am able to know exactly where he lays trapped in the wreckage despite have been traveling at speeds near 200 MPH when it occurred.  Cristian de la Fuente looked so fey going into the scene that the only shock is that he doesn't die!<br/><br/>Add in a healthy mix of editing that was either done by a 13 year old boy or to attract them to the theaters.  Really, how many shots of busty women spectators or race-groupies eating sticking phallic foodstuffs into their mouths do we need?  Oh wait, how many shots of busty racing spectators in general do we need?  Lots, according to Renny Harlin.  The only thing I and my two female companions got out of this movie was the vague idea that race tracks are a great place to pick up women."

","Why, Sly, why?!!!!  This movie is a waste of both Renny Harlin and Sylvester Stallone's talents.  I'm shocked Sly thought this was okay enought to keep his name on the Screenplay credits.  This movie is the standard cracked-up-mentor-comes-back-to-teach-the-hotshot-rookie-he- used-to-be, but as we've seen in the genre before, it can be done well. The dialogue in this film is poor.  And worse than that, the performances by everyone, except Burt Renoylds who I think does a good job (but looks horrible), cannot transcend the material.<br/><br/> By the end you're supposed to be cheering on Jimmy Blye, but I felt nothing except pleasure that I used a gift certificate to see this piece of junk. No character made me want to invest in them.  Even Gina Gershon, nor the scantily clad random women peppering the film, could save sitting through this movie! (but the fellas must've had a hell of a good time shooting it though) If you're going to see this movie for the stunts and driving effects, it's pretty worth it, but even some of the CG in it was outrageously poorly done.  I'd give the movie an Oscar for Sound Editing/design, but the rest of it is beyond saving.  Mr. Stallone, be glad that in the later months the marketing dept chose not to push your name on the film so much, cause it could only bring you down, despite the money it's made so far.  It's not the worst movie I've seen ever, but it sure is in the top 20..."

Most of my complaints are similar to other CART racing fans. My favorte gaffes: <br/><br/>The street scene, no I'm not going to bother complaining about it being in the film, but I just wonder who started the cars? Champ cars don't have starters. You have to have someone start the car from behind the car with a starter.<br/><br/>Champ Cars as Lawn Darts while crashing and flying into the air.<br/><br/>I think they meant to make a golfong film due to the abundance of water hazards. Champ cars run on methanol. Methanol doesn't burn in water!<br/><br/>You don't need to clutch these cars.<br/><br/>CART Driving 101 cars fitting in with the real cars as seemlessly as one side of the Grand Canyon fits with the other.<br/><br/>That Alex Barron spin at the end looked sooooooooo fake.<br/><br/>He's passing Michael Andretti in the #20 Visteon car! Well I guess they couldn't have said Memo Moreno was passing Roberto Moreno without explanations. <br/><br/>The coin scene. What did they do, coat the tires with a fast drying epoxy? That scene was bulls***. <br/><br/>Anyhow, no one was expecting next year's Oscar winning Best Picture, were they? At $5.75, I didn't feel ripped off. <br/><br/>As for Box office success, Look who they beat: 1. Driven 2. Bridget Jones's Diary 3. Spy Kids 4. Along Came a Spider 5. Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles 6. Blow 7. Town and Country 8. The Forsaken 9. Joe Dirt 10. Freddy Got Fingered <br/><br/>Nobody. The real test for a movie so heavily promoted, opening against zero competition, is to see what happens the second weekend after people tell their friends about it. <br/><br/>Jean Alesi had a cameo apperace, shaking Stallone's hand before he got into the car. I spotted Jacques Villeneuve though. <br/><br/>Overall, I agree with all the movie critics that this movie is a dud!"

","""Driven"" reminds me of ""Days of Thunder,"" and I don't mean that as a compliment. Doing a film on the high-octane world of CART auto racing was a fine idea, as was getting proven action director Renny Harlin to helm the project. But a lot of stuff was lost in the execution. Even the flash here is lukewarm, and the many visual effects use to make the racing action all the more exciting come across as very fake. Meanwhile, much of the cast is sleepwalking through the movie, including Sylvester Stallone in the time-honored role of the old champion brought out of retirement to mentor the new young turk (Kip Pardue, who will be a star eventually). And the women in the cast, beautiful as they are, are only there for scenery. ""Driven"" seems more concerned with macho posturing than true romance. Only Gina Gershon, who plays Stallone's perpetually scorned former wife, elicits true sparks of acting passion here, and even she seems like she's stuck in a different (and better) movie. ""Driven"" isn't nearly the worst movie of the year, but it should have had an extensive tune-up before it was launched."

Those of you complaining about realism make me laugh, I mean when has a movie EVER been completely realistic? So aside from 2 cars swimming with the fishies and the sometimes too loud soundtrack I thought Driven was a great movie. Someone questioned the realism of Bly and Brandenburg pulling off the track to help Memo, but it's happened...Late 80's if I remember right, Dale Earnhardt (R.I.P #3) clipped Rusty Wallace and sent him flipping in to the infield at Talladega. Earnhardt pulled off the track, got out of his car and checked on Rusty (who, amazingly walked away from the wreck with only a broken wrist).

He wrote one terrific screenplay 25 years ago, and has never recaptured the magic either on paper or on screen.  Yes he has made loads of money, but he has created no real piece of work since Rocky.  The Bad news is that Stallone may be the best thing in this sorry movie except for the spectacular race scenes.  I feel certain, Burt Reynolds is working the day after having the bandages removed from his most recent face-lift.  He looks like a horror film star IN FULL MAKE-UP.  Kip Pardue recreates his almost too pretty boy character from Remember the Titans.  Robert Sean Leonard continues his fall from the promise shown in Dead Poets Society.  Renny Harlin has directed exactly ONE watchable film - Die Hard 2 ... and he copied the first one for that success.  My only hope from this one is that newcomer Estella Warren moves on to roles that push her skills.  I don't know if Planet of the Apes will tell us much.

"jhaggardjr","8","1","2","29 April 2001"," One of Sly's better ones
","""Driven"" reteams Sylvester Stallone with director Renny Harlin since their excellent 1993 action flick ""Cliffhanger"". Even though ""Driven"" can't quite top the tandem's earlier effort, it's still a pretty good movie. Plus, I give them credit for trying something a little different. Instead of an R-rated romp filled with violence, blood, and gruesome deaths (which Stallone and Harlin are noted for), they've made a PG-13 picture with none of those aspects. The action and special effects are still intact, though they're different this time out. ""Driven"" centers on two race car drivers: one who's the current champ (Til Schweiger), and the other who's a rookie phenom (Kip Pardue). Burt Reynolds is on hand as a team owner who's representing the rookie. Then the kid starts to have a few bad outings, and that's when Reynolds asks Stallone (as a former race car champ) to come on and help the kid out. ""Driven"" does have it's flaws. Parts of the movie tend to go over-the-top, and is marred by some stupid supporting characters (especially Reynolds, who's O.K. here; but I'm just getting a little sick and tired of a certain character who will go to any lengths to win at all costs). The screenplay, by Stallone (writing solo for the first time since ""Rocky V"") isn't great, but it's better than most of Stallone's scripts to some of his earlier movies. Still, I liked most of what I saw in ""Driven"". The race car scenes deliver punch and are exciting (thanks to good directing by Harlin). Stallone gives a good performance too. This is one of his better efforts, and he hasn't made too many good movies in the last 10 years or so. Another very good performance is turned in by young Pardue, as the rookie. I remember first seeing him in last year's Disney hit ""Remember the Titans"". He played ""Sunshine"" the quarterback, and was excellent in that film. He's got a bigger role here in ""Driven"", and plays his part exceptionally well. I believe we'll be seeing alot of this actor in years to come. ""Driven"" is no masterpiece to be sure, but it'll do for now. As far as Stallone's sports movies go, it's not as good as the original ""Rocky"", but it sure is far better than his awful 1987 arm wrestling flop ""Over The Top"". I'll take ""Driven"" over that one any day.<br/><br/>*** (out of four)"

Part of the reason for this is the fact that the CGI (which I thought would be great) was like watching a Play Station 2 video game!  The music is relentless and not thrilling whatsoever. The script, by Sylvester Stallone, has little character development through dialogue, but contains some conflict and originality, I'll give Stallone that.  Stallone's acting wasn't bad and neither were some of the other performances, but Burt Reynolds, he's about as dull as they come.  Who let that guy act?<br/><br/>Harlin changes angles every two seconds and each shot is too frantic. It gets to be annoying.

It wasn't necessarily the script that made this a bad film, but the production team.  On a more positive note, I don't like car racing, I never have, so maybe people who do will like this movie.

Of course if there was a story, you couldn't hear it over the overblown background noise and loud music. I'm still trying to figure out what, in an empty stadium, can make so much noise??? Gena Gershon was a total waste, same with Burt Reynolds. The best acting came from Til Schweiger, and he sure didn't set that bar any too high. The one scene where they go racing through downtown Chicago was fun. But come on, after the two finally stop, they just stand there and have a nice leisurely chat on the shoulder of the road and no police? Plus, are these cars just sitting there with the keys in 'em waiting for a joyrider to come along and just drive them off? One last question, I wonder if they had to pay all the T & A women for their ""efforts"" in making this film?"

","I am a complete freak when it comes to cars.<br/><br/>Even so, the sight of this movie was a complete horror. Ofcourse there were some nice shots from CHAMP-car races, however every accident was (from a technical point of view) a disaster. Cars spinning ten times, flying through the air, a steel-bar chassis, fuel which blew with a big explosion, CHAMPcars in the streets of Detroit, a circuit ran in Germany instead of an oval... Don't watch this movie if you happen to watch motorsport on a regular basis."

","...this movie is so bad it hurts.<br/><br/>((Spoiler ahead)).<br/><br/>To give you an idea of how bad this movie is, picture this. Elegant gala reception. A couple of fast F1 cars on display. The main character (don't even remember his name) gets mad at girlfriend, runs away, picks a car, wreaks havoc on the streets (all with corny and badly made computer animation). Our hero, the underdog (Stallone -wait... why is he always casting himself as an underdog, also ran, second place loser nowadays?) chases him, destroying cars and property. Good. They even manage to lift a sewer cover on the process (with computer animation straight out of a Commodore 64). Stallone catches up to his proteg√©e, delivers a rousing speech while police (helicopters, cars, the works) watch.

","I liked this movie pretty well, in the beginning. The crash scenes were spectacular eye candy, the music worked, etc. Then, I learned about race cars. Almost everything depicted in this movie could not actually have happened (ex- race cars don't start with a key, as shown in the Chicago street race, the cars are not powered by gasoline, so that big crash in the lake could not have caused a fire, etc, etc, etc...)It kinda puts a damper on the excitement. What surprised me most, was that real race car announcers and drivers participated in this movie-and none of them bothered to notice that EVERYTHING in this movie is a sham! Embarrassing....."
"Sebastian Valmont II","1","1","2","24 April 2001"," Crash and Burn!!!!!!!!!
","Burt Reynolds has already starred in two of the worst car movies ever made (`Stroker Ace' and `The Cannonball Run 2'). Well congratulations, Burt, on number three.<br/><br/>`Driven' is so awful on so many levels, it's actually hard to remember all of them after the movie's over. First of all, there's the characters. They could be cardboard cutouts, except someone forgot to cut them out: in other words, although their lives are as clich√©d as their dialogue, we're not even given enough details about them to fully form the clich√©s.<br/><br/>
To start with, there's Stallone's character, an ex racecar driver who blew it on the track and at home. He apparently caused some big accident which ruined his career, and which may or may not have paralysed his old friend Burt Reynolds, who now owns a racing team. The exact details are never made clear. He also apparently walked out on his wife leaving her bitter and resentful, although again, exactly what happened is never explained. Then there's Jimmy Bly, played by the guy from `Remember the Titant', the hot young driver who just can't take the pressure because he's not `doing it for himself', although exactly why he can't take the pressure is again, never fully explained. And then there's Simone, played (nominally) by Estella Warren, who supposedly works for this other driver but never appears to actually do anything. Oh yeah, and there's a journalist woman, played by nobody,  who falls for Sly after he woos her over a hot game of pool, a cinematic device that hasn't been used in, oh, about three days.<br/><br/>
Part of the problem is that the characters never get to interact with each other for more than about three seconds before being interrupted by either another gratuitous title card (Japan: Three Days Before the Race, Italy: Six Minutes Before The Race, etc) or another car accident in which bad CGI junk flies toward the camera and Renny Harlin indulges in sub-John Woo camera tricks which don't work.<br/><br/>Then there's the acting. Stallone and Reynolds look awful. Stallone's face resembles a grocery bag that's been kicked around a parking lot for a couple of hours. Burt's had so many facelifts his skin no longer moves. Not that the script helps, but both are awful. So are Estella Warren and the guy from 'Remember the Titans': there's this hillarious scene where they flirt by a swimming pool and since neither has any charisma to speak of, they just talk in monotones, looking morosely pretty, and the overall effect is like watching a CK One ad in hell. Only Gina Gershon comes out of it OK, using her one decently-written scene as Sly's ex-wife where she rages at him to show us she can act. After that, her character turns into a TURBOBITCH!!!!!! And she gamely plays along, chewing the scenery and wearing her TURBOBITCH!!!!!! hat with style.<br/><br/>But the funniest scene in the whole movie comes when there's a car crash during a race and the guy from `Remember the Titans' turns his car around, drives back up the track, dodging all the oncoming cars, pulls up and saves the other driver BEFORE the emergency crews get there. The car stuff doesn't even bear talking about: there are so many factual and continuity errors (you can't drive racecars on public roads, the tyres will explode, a car that's already exploded will not explode again because all the fuel in the fuel tanks will have burnt off, etc) that all the sequences are laughable. The CGI is really obvious too.<br/><br/>Perhaps Sly and Burt could team up again for `The Cannonball Run III': after all, a cannonball is only one step away from being a bomb, and they seem pretty damn good at making those."

","First,I am a huge CART,Formula1 and IRL fan,and know the cars and watch all of the races I can.I was waiting for this movie for months.It was perfect.Stallone and Champ Cars.I heard from the papers bad reviews,but what would you expect?<br/><br/>I didn't know a film this bad could make it out of a studio.<br/><br/>I could tape every CART race on my VCR,edit it,and make a better movie.The clips shown are obviously fake,and even show the wrong courses.The Champ Cars are ludicrously modeled in physics.When a car hits another,it is launched about 10 feet in the air.Cars burst into flames and get shred up at almost every turn.They make this film to make CART seem more ""exciting""to the mainstream.Any auto racing fan who remembers the tragic deaths of Greg Moore,Davey Allison,and Ayrton Senna know that crashes are NOT why fans watch auto-racing.The scary fact is that CART licensed this.<br/><br/>Some spoilers...<br/><br/>If I magicly forget the almost 30(literaly counted)errors about Champ cars,I see the plot is worse then Judge Dred(Whoops,that seems a bit too harsh,but deserving).Bly is a rookie and wins his second race he is in and wins several more.This is considered,in auto racing,positively amazing.But,Bly dosen't win a few.Oh,no!Let's dump him!To those who aren't into racing,this would be like the coach of the Miami Dolphins being fired for finishing 14-2.<br/><br/>That CART would allow this filth to represent the best racing in the world scares me.Looking for fast cars?Go for Fast and the Furious,a very good film.AVOID DRIVEN AT ALL COSTS!"
"grimsby53","3","1","2","14 July 2001"," Another failed racing movie
","Disappointed by every other race film you've seen?  Driven is worse.  Bad plot, forced dialogue, and mediocre acting are things you are prepared to accept in a racing picture.  What you want in return are bad to the bone driving sequences.  There are none of those here.  Instead, music video style editing and lame computer effects take center stage in the ""action"" sequences.  The best thing you can say about this movie is that the cars sound great."
"ErikRP-2","6","1","2","10 June 2001"," Imagine the possibilities...
","This movie started out as being about Formula 1 but because Sylvester Stallone did not get the free and unfettered access that he wanted/needed, he took his movie to the next best thing, CART.  Apparently though Stallone kept a lot of his ""original"" ideas that he came up with while he was hanging around the F1 teams.  For example, I don't know of another wheelchair-bound team owner other than Sir Frank Williams of F1.  There are other touches here and there throughout the movie that remind me more of F1 than CART, most notably the global appeal.<br/><br/>While this movie is not as bad as it has been reported, there are several let-downs.  The most notable flaw in my opinion is the musical score.  The musical soundtrack seemed to be in the way of much of the script.  I think one of the first lessons of making a movie is if the script is week, fill in the holes with some music.  I was expecting Burt Reynolds to burst into song there was so much music happening.  <br/><br/>My second biggest complaint is with the race sequences.  I admit that I am approaching this movie from the view of a racing fan.  The way the movie was promoted, not to mention the subject of the movie itself, suggests that I'm going to see a lot of good driving sequences.  There were moments, however all too often the track sequences were so cut up as to think I was watching a rock video.  There was little tension built up on the race sequences and I was left quite unimpressed, despite some high calibre driving from some of racing's top names, both CART and F1.<br/><br/>Overall, I was somewhat disappointed and more than once looked at my watch to see how soon I would be home.  A better script, better character development and a range of emotion that went beyond the typical teen angst movie would have earned this movie a solid 8 or 9 from most viewers. <br/><br/>For now, I'm still waiting for a successor to John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix..."
"teamliz","Null","1","2","6 June 2001"," Should have been titled ""Drivel""
","This movie purports to be about Champ Car racing, and in fact is nothing of the kind.  This is a movie for people who have never seen a race and who think that race car pilots are incompetent, immoral idiots who can't drive five feet without hitting something and, despite the fact that every single car crashes during every single race, no one is ever hurt or killed and the cars, apparently, can be rebuilt instantaneously, for free.<br/><br/>There are so many errors in this movie that there is no way to know how to begin to catalogue them.  Just in the crash scenes alone, I must point out that Champ Cars do not become airborne when they crash, unless perhaps their inattentive crews have installed the wings upside down; the sole purpose for the wings is to create downforce and stick the cars onto the track so they will NOT fly.  As for the Fire In The Pond sequence: methane does not burn with a visible flame, and water extinguishes a methane fire.  No one in a Champ Car race would reverse on the track to go and aid a fellow pilot; that is why medical crews are employed (and this is not 1973 Formula One).  And there are specific rules against blocking other drivers.  The main objection to racing Champ Cars on city streets at night is that Champ Cars have no lights; the secondary one is that the downforce of the cars would suck the manhole covers up into the air and hurl them into the passing traffic and the crowd, causing enormous carnage and a lot of lawsuits.  No professional pilot would race a Champ Car without any protective gear at all, far less without a helmet.  And those cars don't belong to the pilots, they belong to the teams.  Both those guys would have been arrested, jailed and fired for a stunt like that race down the city streets.<br/><br/>I could go on, and I do among my racing friends.  But suffice it to say that this movie fails on every single test of Must See: the characters are cardboard cutouts; the racing is unbelievably bad and inaccurately portrayed; the details of the tracks are wrong (and in one sequence ""Detroit"" is clearly and correctly labeled ""Chicago""); and for the final indignity, Stallone is claiming now that he did his own driving, much to the outrage of the three Canadians who in fact did all the stunt work (Stallone did only such driving as he could do being pulled behind a camera truck).<br/><br/>This movie ranks right up there with ""Plan 9 from Outer Space.""  Where are Crow, Servo and Joel when you need them?"

These characters are so diluted and shallow, you wonder how you can see someone on screen for nearly two hours and not know a thing about them.

An intelligent script, with direction that does it justice. Even all the side characters are brilliantly played. This movie never grabbed the public's attention the way it should have. It's a film that reeks of its time and place. The first 38 minutes of the running time are particularly hard to endure. . I'm not sure whether it is really a guilty pleasure or simply a film I remember as being one. So why do I like it so much? The characters are wonderful in the movie. The film unfolds in two halves.

Sylvester Stallone should not be in this movie anyhow. Any Formula One Indy legend is the correct replacement for Sylvester Stallone. Estelle Warren maybe a beautiful woman for the movie, but she is not a good actress. It should be Kirsten Dunst or Tara Reid should be in the movie.

","Driven had pretty good car racing scenes. It certainly wasn't one of the worst films of 2001. My ONE big complaint is `Where are the cute guys?'  I mean, we get Burt Reynolds and Sly Stallone, who would look like dried up prunes without that thick movie make-up.  And the guy who played Jimmy Bly had nothing that sparked my interest.  And WHY do they always put ridiculous love stories in the middle of an action film.  It just ruins the most interesting thing about the movie.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS):  The scene where Jimmy hops into one of those racing cars and Joe follows is absurd.  First of all, anyone driving close to 200 mph weaving between traffic and going the wrong way would get killed pretty quickly.  And when Joe hops into that car, wouldn't he need a key or something to start it.  Not to mention, those 2 would have been arrested. But all that happens is they get fined by the racing organization. Also, those crashed they show look absurd because if that really happened, onlookers would get killed in the stands by the dozens.  I mean, those cars where flying hundreds of feet.  And of course, Jimmy had to make a play for his rivals girl.  With all those girls pinching his a**, he only wanted to go out with the one that was in love with his rival.  And then the rival turned out to be descent, so there is no bad guy to root  against. (END OF SPOILERS)<br/><br/>
I mean when you say the best actor in the film was Sly Stallone, that ain't exactly a good thing.  At least his speech could be interpreted in this.<br/><br/>
FINAL VERDICT:  Car racing fans will enjoy, but if you are not one, like me, don't waste your time.  There are plenty of other so-so movies that have cutier guys to watch for 2 hours."
"zipdaddy","8","1","3","17 December 2001"," Fast-paced drama about life, love, and the Human Race.
","Contains Spoilers Where to start?<br/><br/>Driven is not a movie for everyone.  If you don't like racing, stereotypical characters, flashy and commercialized filmmaking, and utter lack of realism in some parts, then this film isn't for you.  If you went into this movie seeking a film of the same caliber as say, ""Le Mans"" or ""Field of Dreams,"" you WILL be sorely disappointed.  Additionally, if you can't take Sly Stallone seriously, you will have a hard time with this film.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a young driver named Jimmy Bly (Kip Purdue)...a quiet rookie in a sea of veterans.  As in ""Days of Thunder,"" Jimmy is an incredible raw talent.  However, the silliness of ""Days of Thunder"" does not find its way into this.  Bly is an excellent driver, but soon, the pressure of being a media virgin in the overly hyped, super-televised, devil-may-care world of international racing begins to affect his performance on the track.<br/><br/>As the pressure mounts, Jimmy's team owner (Burt Reynolds) brings in the typical ""old guy who's seen the best and the worst it can get..."" to help Jimmy focus on the track.  As I said, this movie is pretty stereotypical, and even predictable.  However, Stallone, in playing the veteran Joe Tanto, creates and excellent character with a realistic, tangible dynamic with Jimmy Bly.  You get the sense that, even though there is some initial confusion as to his role on the team, Joe Tanto rushes headlong into his task of steadying the young rookie.  This culminates in the scene involving 1000hp CART cars roaring through the streets of Chicago, with Tanto risking his already shaky reputation to try and reel Bly in.  The scene, while goofy to a degree, is still touching in the fact that you realize that Tanto is willing to abandon his fame, popularity, and career to try and help a kid he barely knows.  In that sense, Sylvester Stallone does a wonderful job portraying his character not as a run-down old man, but a thoughtful veteran...<br/><br/>The diametric opposite of Jimmy Bly, and even Joe Tanto, is the ""villain"" of the film, Beau Brandenberg (Till Schweiger), who is really not a villain at all.  He is young, arrogant, not to mention the reigning FedEx CART series champion.  He is, at the beginning of the film, involved in a relationship with Sophia (Estella Warren, who's character falls so flat it's not worth mentioning...), and he breaks it off.  He too is succumbing to the pressure, although for him, the pressure comes from Jimmy Bly.  So Brandenberg cuts off the outside world to focus his thoughts on his career.  If Sophia had been written better, I'm sure we would've have thought Brandenburg heartless.  But Sophia goes right over to Jimmy Bly's camp, putting additional pressure on Brandenburg, and furthering the gap between him and Bly. Brandenburg's character lines are confused slightly during the scene at the CART prototype party, in which he finally pours his heart out to Sophia, wanting her back, much to the chagrin of Jimmy Bly.  This causes the aforementioned (and, I admit, incredibly amusing) scene with the CART cars tearing through the streets of downtown Chicago.  Here we realize that Brandenburg IS in fact a human being, as he crawls back to Sophia.<br/><br/>From there, the lines of ""good guy, bad guy"" further break down until it's almost unnoticeable.  Brandenburg and Bly team up to help save the life of their mutual friend Memo Moreno after an horrific crash.  At the end of the movie, we are brought to believe that Bly and Brandenburg become fast friends, with Sophia as the connection between them, when in fact, it's the veteran leadership of Joe Tanto, who gives counsel to both Bly and Brandenburg at some point.<br/><br/>There are other characters on the periphery of the story that influence the dynamic between Bly, Brandenburg, and Tanto.  The avatar of CART's super-pressurized world is Jimmy's brother, DeMille Bly (Robert Sean Leonard).  He acts as Jimmy's demon, bodyguard, betrayer, and best friend all at the same time.  He, in a way, drives Jimmy to Sophia, who offers a refuge in a real, caring human being (the one light in which her character excels).  DeMille acts as Jimmy's manager and as the ""voice"" to Jimmy's ""face.""  Often, it seems that DeMille is acting in Jimmy's best interest, but he doesn't seem to realize that his constant pushing/nagging/selling-out is increasing the pressure on his younger brother...<br/><br/>One could spend all day writing about the intricacies of the character relationships, but no one will read it.  I say, give Driven a chance.  The special effects are tremendous, more so when you realize that 98% percent are done with REAL CARS and not CGI effects.  The acting is shallow in parts, but very human and heartfelt in others.  Enjoy."

Sure, the movie is a little long, yet if it had been shortened some of the great things about the movie would be missing. It's unusual for a movie like this to have good character development and a fairly decent plot, which is one of the reasons I recommend this. Besides the excellent racing scenes, the movie is kind of like ROCKY except it's about racing in stead of boxing. This movie is a must-see for people who think Sylvester Stallone can't act because this movie will definitely prove them wrong.

","This movie is so much like a good man--it's there just taken for granted, never listened too and called stupid. There have been lots of ""complaints"" posted where the person just didn't get all of the movie the first time. A small example is one comment about the car scene on the streets of Chicago. The commenter said a flaw in the scene was when the officer didn't take off after the cars traveling at 195 mph. Uh, in the movie the cops calls for back-up as he gets into his car. Personally I could suspend the disbelief that the cop couldn't catch up and I let it go. I know this is small, but I think it shows how people WANT this movie to be stupid. They see the cars and think, 'dumb white male'. They hear the music and think, 'stupid Nascar red necks'. Sly's biggest mistake, besides costume and his choice of make-up director, was not realizing he would have to suspend disbelief from the viewer that a good man's story, told and viewed from a male point of view, could be smart and have some worth. <br/><br/>Answers to some questions posted: <br/><br/>""Estella Warren is always at the track and this is never explained""........she is the fianc√©e of one of the drivers and as such is on pit lane. Again.......these scenes were filmed on pit lane minutes prior to the start of REAL races. <br/><br/>""Why is Estella Warren in Germany and Tokyo?"" This is actually explained in the movie. Stallone's character gives the exposition at the end of the Chicago race scene. The other driver thought she would give him the ""edge"" he was looking for. Personally, I don't think it is that much of a stretch to think a man with money would spend it on an obviously gorgeous woman in the hopes of a ""payoff"". If the woman ""belongs"" to a competitor all the more reason. Call me crazy, but is that not what men do? Do they not say, to themselves at the very least, ""See, I got your girl""? <br/><br/>I feel like audiences have been conditioned to Glamour/Cosmo exposition. This also has the effect, in a perverse irony, of attaching a default stereotype of and unsophisticated thinking to anyone who doesn't talk or act in the manner prescribed. This is evident when blatant visuals, like the long shot of Estella's arched feet with curled toes in the pool (female orgasm reference) are criticized. Do we really need a character saying, ""That reminds me of when I gave a woman an orgasm. Gee I wish I could do the same for/to you?"" If we put the same shot in a foreign film, it would be artistic and symbolic; maybe even genius, depending on the lighting. Because straight men are just stupid, right? That shot couldn't have any artistic merit; not in this movie. I mean there are racecars in it. Those type of people are Neanderthals, right? I mean you would have to suspend that disbelief before we as an audience would actually listen to anything this story would have to say, right? <br/><br/>Sly had the nerve to make a movie where the individual accepts their emotional adversary for who they are, or who they choose to be at the time, and rather than sulk or complain about it, they focus on bettering themselves. And as it turns out, that can be a good thing. God forbid you tell a story in a ""straight male"" form. Then it's stupid and trivial. Call me crazy but I enjoyed watching a woman who didn't chase after a man when he broke her heart. I enjoyed watching a man make a mistake and having the opportunity to fix it in a way other than the way in which Cosmo or Glamour tells us it should be fixed. I enjoyed watching two brothers ""make-up"" by letting go. I enjoyed SEEING these things instead of being told through dialogue exposition EVERY LAST DETAIL of the issue. <br/><br/>I also enjoyed the REAL LIFE footage of races. Apparently some people want to be fed, line by line, everything they should see and feel. If you can't look at real footage of a race and tell that they allow not only cars and teams on pit row and that all people down there aren't drivers, then you don't need to be watching a movie that reaches outside of your ""norm"". <br/><br/>This is a movie I come back to over and over. I just realized this weekend that the character of Gina is based on Sly's real ex-wife Bridgette Neilson (check out this season of Surreal Life, 2004, if you don't believe me). It is so uncanny once you get it. The sound is awesome in this movie, but then we have bumper stickers that say, 'I Love Jet Noise' here. If you like romance, sound, action, musical composition, different ways of looking at things and people watching, you will find all these things in this movie. But you may have to watch it twice."

","After making Judge Dredd, Sylvester Stallone got interested in the world of auto racing.<br/><br/>He said of the film's concept, ""Racing's very much like the world of acting. You have your front runners and you have guys that are there for the long race, and you have other guys that block for other people, that are called supporting and character actors. It's all the same kind of situation. And you realize that you can't always be number one. You just can't be the guy in front all the time. So what you can do is lend support to, and help and nourish and encourage someone else. So it's like your experiences live on in someone else. If you can find some young actor and you can say, ""Listen, don't do this and don't do that and avoid this and that,"" and share your experiences, and he does succeed, you can say, ""You know what, I kind of contributed to that."" As an actor did you have to learn you can't always be number one the hard way. Unfortunately, I did.""<br/><br/>Although this film was a commercial failure, it brought Renny Harlin back after his fiasco Cutthroat Island. He and Stallone had teamed up before for Cliffhanger. It was also a critical failure, nominated for seven Golden Raspberry awards and earning the ire of Jay Leno, who told Richard Roeper that it was the worst car film ever made.<br/><br/>In the middle of the 2000 Champ Car Season, rookie driver Jimmy Bly (Kip Pardue, Remember the Titans) is in the lead with five big wins. But the pressure is getting to him, thanks to his brother and business manager Demille (Robert Sean Leonard, TV's House). It's also put him directly in the crosshairs of reigning champ and teammate Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger, Inglorious Basterds), who is also dealing with the distraction of his fiancee Sophia (Estella Warren, 2001's Planet of the Apes).<br/><br/>So Beau decides to dump her and he starts winning again. However, Jimmy has a big crash and needs an older driver to be his mentor, so team owner Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds!) brings back former champion Joe Tanto (Stallone) to replace Memo, another driver who is now married to Joe's ex-wife Cathy (Gina Gershon). Whew - the drama is already started, but what do you expect from a movie with the tagline ""Welcome to the human race.""<br/><br/>Joe's just supposed to be a blocker, but when he learns that Jimmy is getting with Beau's ex-fiancee, he tries to use his experience to fix things. It takes a car crash that nearly kills Memo to bring everyone back together and be friends.<br/><br/>Jimmy ends up the champ, with Beau in second and Joe in third. Everyone celebrates and I cheer on the credits, which finally freed me from this film. Stallone's original script was 220 pages and Harlin's first cut was four hours long, so while I often want a film to give more, I was fine with this movie ending when it did.<br/><br/>If you know racing, one would assume you'll love all the real racers showing up, but I would imagine so many of the details, like Joe throwing coins on the track to touch with his car, are absolutely ridiculous. Then again, this is supposedly a trick that trick real-life Formula One driver Juan Manuel Fangio of Argentina used to perform."

","Well I didn't hate this which I expected to after reading multiple scathing reviews.

I viewed this strictly on an entertainment level where it worked just fine, even if the love-triangle/romance aspect did wear a bit thin.<br/><br/>The actual race scenes have been filmed in a way that reminded me of 'Any Given Sunday', sort of ADD, flipping back and worth between shots of feet changing gears on pedals, hands on steering wheel, speedometer, giant drops of rain blurring vision, crowd shots, hot babes, the pit crew, the boss crew.

","...but it can be hard to find sometimes. I remember, when it first appeared in theaters, some friends called it ""Rocky on wheels."" That, it definitely is not. More of Stallone's story filtered through in Rocky. Here, I have the impression that half of the story was jettisoned for ""slowing down the action."" <br/><br/>For there is plenty of action. The speed and horror of crashing are well communicated, as is - strangely enough - the simple thrill of racing. Harlin does a good job with the action sequences, making the moment of impact truly impressive. Racing relies so much on instinct rather than preplanned thought; the pit crew and support staff can only prepare and plan so much - the race still revolves around the driver. Racing is an old sport, and any tried-and-true fans who rent or buy this film hoping accurate, down-to-the-nub details will be disappointed. Harlin and Stallone take plenty of dramatic license. The famous chase through the streets of Chicago? Come on. While obviously something like that would never happen, I understand that Harlin and Stallone were trying to communicate the rage of a rejected young man in a unique and forceful manner. I can allow for that; but the chase went on far too long, almost as though it were enjoying the spectacle for its own sake. Just don't say you weren't warned.<br/><br/>Still, in between the racing montages and the overly-loud boom-boom music, there are some good parts. Robert Sean Leonard of ""House"" fame turns a really great performance. Stallone is strangely given little to do - the story of his character, Joe Tanto, is truncated, giving the impression that is where a lot of cutting happened so the film focuses more on Jimmy Bly (a suitably intense Kip Pardue). This is unfortunate, because I speculate that it is Tanto's back-story that is the real catalyst for the final climatic race. Certain elements of the story felt forced as a result. Our introduction to Joe Tanto happens with little warning or preamble, and exactly why Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds) thought Tanto could help the situation is never clearly stated. Stallone is perfectly cast as the old veteran with a few good races left in him; but , save for the ending, all his character does is dispense advice throughout the film. We see his impact on others, but never really see the impact of events on him. <br/><br/>And this is ultimately what drags Driven down: is it about Bly (Pardue) or Tanto (Stallone)? They assembled some good young acting talent, had Stallone ready to play the embattled-but-charming man of wisdom, had Burt Reynolds ready to chew up any scenery he was given. What was 'wrong' in the '80s for Stallone was 'right' for this movie: if it was more about his character, Joe Tanto, his relationship with Carl Henry (Reynolds), and the changes Tanto had to make to help a younger driver and allow himself to get back a little dignity, suddenly you'd have a pretty good film on your hands. Instead, what we have is an assemblage of racing montages with fragments of a story in between - a real wasted opportunity."

CSI Miami is not necessarily known for it's plausible plots, but do I love it? Yep, every time Horatio crosses that screen. Beautiful scenery, a plot I don't have to read a companion novel to follow, and eye candy. A great way to unwind after a long day...<br/><br/>If you watch the deleted scene content with narration by Sylvester Stallone, there might be more insight into what SS was going for, in terms of the distortion of one's values and to what length people will go to achieve fame. There were sub plots that got lost in the edit. Some of that would have made for better developed characters. And yes, not all of the race sequences or rescue for that matter, were completely accurate. Then again, this is Hollywood exercising their creative liberties. Sue 'em...If anything, Days of Thunder was more painful to watch.<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with SS and Burt Reynolds on screen.

","Car racing and films. Sports and films. Of you let go your imagination, these are powerful mixtures. Sport is about movement, it's like a dance, and that's cinematic, indeed it is one of the most rich cinematic fields. It has live emotion, which means you will not no what to expect, despite taking sides. There is a strong aspect of suspense that surrounds every game, every sport, and racing isn't an exception. But than there is a huge catch: no one (supposedly) knows where it will go. Anything can happen in sports, it lives on the moment, more than any live or filmed performance, musical theatrical or any other else. So, this means that in order to keep the fuel of sports emotion true and alive, you can't stage it. And you can't make a feature film without having nearly everything staged. So that's the difference. Dance, music, theatre, it's all a performance, it's all about delivering something that has been preestablished. Cinema inherited this. That's why we need interesting minds to have interesting art, where the most talented of the sportsmen can perfectly be an intellectual schmuck. And it's also because of this that i personally find it impossible, at least with the tools we have so far, to successfully create a film (not documentary) that binds together sports (any sport) and film. That's probably why the Wachovsky explored racing relying on technology, because they knew the ordinary tools were useless (i haven't seen 'speed racer' yet). And yes, we have Chariots of Fire, but sport is only incidental there, and works as a frozen performance, which the music enhances. Pure sports films, i don't know any that is remotely interesting.<br/><br/>Even less when we have the attitude of this film. This is such a mess, way beyond the problems of sports and film together. So here we have Reynolds, playing a crippled ex macho racing hero, which is probably the only role he ever played. We have Stallone, playing the old war hero, coming back to action, to save the day where he is needed. And we have a couple of other clich√© characters, uprising stars, guys struggling to be themselves, and to feel free. Anyway, check this: every pseudo dramatic arc that is intended here exists in a different world of relationships. Love over Success, Pride, personal affirmation. Dull, vulgar, done below the watchable. Not even a single try at filming the races in an interesting way. All explosion and injuries, coins grabbed by the tires, spectacular collisions, boring, useless.<br/><br/>Oh, the rescuing scene by the two leaders of the championship still can look ridiculous in the middle of this ridiculous film <br/><br/>My opinion: 1/5<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
"classicalsteve","2","0","1","17 August 2009"," DRIVEL: Lowest Common Denominator Clich√© Tripe Written for Mooks: An Embarrassment for Stallone
","Before I trash this film, I'll suggest if you want a really great film about auto-racing, try ""Heart Like a Wheel"". 1000% better than this trash.<br/><br/>This movie seems like it was concocted by a boardroom of studio executives going down a laundry list of stereotypical interests of young and relatively uneducated sex-starved males in their late teens and early 20's who live in the outback of culture. They dig fast cars, scantily-clad women, ESPN auto-racing, and the cheapest beer available. They have no style, no culture, and the only thing better than sex is more sex. Oh yeah, and they love to see cars smashed to smithereens in every conceivable way. They're the kind of people whose highest cultural aspirations are ""The Man's Show"", ""Spring Break"", and ""Survivor"". They probably think ""Dawson's Creek"" and ""Beverly Hills 90210"" to be way too high-brow. In short, they're mooks. That's for whom this movie was produced. Not you? Better look elsewhere (and please do).<br/><br/>So, the result is: let's put all that stuff into a single movie. Make a ridiculously contrived story (if story it can be called) with lots of cars, young women, car smashes, young women, cars, more young women, more cars, and more car smashes. Oh, did I mention the cars? We'll get Sylvester Stallone to write the script and star, and the director of Die Harder to direct. It'll be a sure hit. How can it miss? All the polling says that males this age love this kind of thing. Cars and sex. We're not here to actually make movies that have a shred of originality. We're here to get kids to pay to go to the movie theatre so we can continue to live in our Beverly Hills mansions and drive our Bentleys. What happens on-screen is largely irrelevant as long as they've paid for their tickets. They can even leave if they want. In the end, we get the dough.<br/><br/>Stallone plays the old racing has-been who has to deal with the young rookie upstart who thinks he's the next thing since Mario Andretti. Of course, long before it happened, I knew the rookie was going to be put in his place by having some terrible race, and the mentor-ship relationship was going to going to kick in where the old guy teaches the new guy. I saw that one coming before I entered the theater. This is movie-by-the-numbers. I'm sure you could pick one up at a hobby store for about $8.00.<br/><br/>And of course there's a clich√© manage a trois. Rookie dumps supermodel who then goes out with the current racing champion. Of course the champion is a complete you-know-what. Now the rookie has something to prove to get the model back, especially way from the jerk. Oh brother. Suggestion: What if the rookie dumped the supermodel for the champ? At least that would have been unexpected. But of course that would have gone against everything this movie is about: contrived clich√© for the mooks.<br/><br/>All I can say is this: if you're a mook, this is definitely the movie for you. Buy all the cheap beer you want, order 16 Pizza Hut pizzas, and then turn on this movie after you're finished watching ESPN auto-racing. It doesn't getting any better than this. And it won't."

It's not really a problem of suspension if disbelief, it's that it really has no purpose, no meaning and it seems that every actor is perfectly aware of that; as a result each performance is so flat and stereotyped that you could figure out the next line or the next scene (sudden and improbable gear-scalings included). the problem,differently from the fast and furious franchise, is that the movie takes itself seriously, thus not preventing you from asking yourself, ""hey, director, ""are you kidding me""?

","Jimmy (Kip Pardue) is a young racing prodigy who has just been dumped by his girl. And not just dumped, but dumped in public and in favor of a rival racer she has long loved. Distraught, Jimmy needs some time alone. He does what seems like the natural thing: stealing a grand prix car and racing it through the busy nighttime streets of Chicago! Fortunately, his older, wiser racing buddy Joe Tanto (Sly Stallone) is there. He heroically steals his own grand prix racer to track down Jimmy, oblivious to the fact that a pair of automobiles with no headlights traveling 200 miles per hour in a busy city might be a tad dangerous.<br/><br/>This is the precise moment, about halfway through the film, where DRIVEN morphs from a harmless piece of fluff into a near total farce. Of course the distracting (and constant) soundtrack, the Saturday morning dialog and the one performance from Stallone where he actually deserved his Razzie nomination only add to the many problems of this overblown, credibility-starved debacle. The racing scenes are uninspired and far too flashy to be effective. Even the seemingly simple special effects, which had a budget of $72 million to draw from, are hopelessly cartoony. I mean really, how can you have that much money and not create a convincing image of a coin flipping through the air?<br/><br/>Still, I'm willing to cut DRIVEN some slack. It has a certain simple charm that periodically grabs your interest even though you know it's not all that good. The behind-the-races story lines -- Stallone forced to accept that he now races only to help Jimmy, Jimmy dealing with his overly aggressive brother/manager, etc. -- are horribly clich√©d and corny, yet mildly amusing.

Renny Harlin did an excellent job at directing this film and he knows how to keep the film in a fast pace and the film goes really quick.<br/><br/>Along from the great directing and pace, the film has got some of the best special effects and crash sequences even filmed for a film.

If you watch it in DTS sound with a sub woofer, make sure that you strap it down to the floor because it will move across the floor. Even though it went head to head against ""The Fast And The Furious"" at the box office this movie had better special effects and story line. <br/><br/>This movie will be enjoyed by the whole family it contains very little violence and swearing unlike ""The Fast And The Furious"".

Firstly, it is impossible to start a Champ Car without electronic help and a team of mechanics, secondly your face would be blown apart even at low speed in a Champ Car minus helmet and thirdly, the bumps and potholes of an unprepared street would probably destroy the suspension! Come on Sly, how on earth did you think you could get away with that one? The acting is appalling, nobody shines in any way. The lines couldn't be more clich√©d. The racing scenes look less convincing that some cheap old computer game. The storyline is dire and couldn't be more predictable if it got down on its knees and begged! The ending defies belief and is possibly the most contrived conclusion I have ever seen! Sly what were you thinking? This is junk! This is filth! This is beyond terrible! I cannot express how completely rubbish Driven is! Sly has starred in many great movies, Rambo and Copland springing to mind, but with this tepid offering he gives massive ammunition to his critics! In fact he gives them a nuclear bomb!!!!!!!!! Driven is one of those films that should never have been made! Sly we know you wanted to make Rocky on wheels, but with this you have tarnished your entire career!!! This film should win awards for how unbelievably bad it is! Worth seeing if only to marvel at how wrong Sly got it."

","Driven is a very good movie, starring Sylvester Stallone. It was a Formula-1 movie, but with drama, too.I HATE drama, but I had to change my protest with this movie. This movie tells about an ex-invict F-1 driver, Beau Branderburg, that lost a race by a mysterious driver, Jimmy Bly(Kip Pardue).But with the pass of the time, Jimmy worsens his career with bad places.Then a old driver, Memo Moreno, becomes Jimmy's assistant.Then Jimmy's career grows up again.In the last race of this good movie, Jimmy Bly become the first, Beau Branderburg becomes the second and Memo Moreno becomes the third placed. My score for Driven is 8/10."

","This is a good movie for those who like dramatic racing scenes. If you are into movies for their theatrical value I would steer away from Driven. Sly Stallone does his best as a coach to a new and promising young driver (Kip Purdue). The two begin to have a friendship similar to one in Days of Thunder with Tom Cruise and Robert Duvall. Kip Purdue is still trying to find his acting talent, which he really doesn't show here, this being only his second lead role. If you are a hard core racing fan you will like the race sequences, but if you are movie buff you are going to notice the bad acting, fast scene changes, and weak plot. Not a bad soundtrack though."

"Skeptic459","2","0","2","31 December 2003"," A hilarious homoerotic love story.
","This movie is so bad! It is absolutely terrible. I wish Sylvestor Stallone would do us all a favor and get out of movies altogether. His movies suck, he sucks and his films will always suck. I got the DVD version of driven. I listened to the audio commentary to hear how Stallone could justify the existence of this appalling film. At one point in the commentary Stallone states how a scene where Stallone's character and Burt Reynolds character argue was very hard to write. Then he states that he finds that ALL SCENES ARE HARD TO WRITE IN MOVIES!!! This is the level of incompetence that we are dealing with here.<br/><br/>All of the acting, if you can call it that, is inept. Kip Pardue has a constant blank expression and looks like he has been sniffing the petrol that his car runs on. Although, there does seem to be sexual tension between Pardue and Til Schweiger. Obviously they can't express their love for one another so they need to use Estella Warren to do this. She jumps from one man to another, like they are playing pass the parcel. Warren acts like someone dropped her on the head as a child. She has a blank look that rivals Purdue and she even seem to consider blinking to be acting. Keanu Reeves would be proud of these actors and their complete lack of skill. You even have Stallone as the mentor who shows Purdue, ahem, the ropes. Did he use lubricant? All this to capture Schweiger's heart. I hope he appreciates it. Reynolds even develops a tear in his eye....awwww.<br/><br/>Not that the actors have much to work with. Stallone writes the characters in such a two dimensional manner that cardboard cut ups of Mr T and William Shatner seem more multi-layered and emotionally complex. Stallone even has a very fruity looking Burt Reynolds as the voyeur. He loves to watch young men with their shirts off racing each other. He wants to race and envies the young racers as they make love passionately.   We know this because STALLONE SPELLS IT OUT AT LEAST THREE TIMES FOR EACH NEW PLOT STRAND!!! There is no ambiguity here. The viewer is handed everything on a platter.<br/><br/>
The track becomes the symbol where Pardue tries to prove his love for Schweiger. What should be happening in the bedroom is actually happening on the track. With the fast cars slipping, sliding and banging each other. Yep, this film is as gay as Top Gun! The last scene is hilarious. The characters hold phallic symbols of bottles of champagne and everyone showers frothy champagne over each others bodies. In one last big homosexual orgy! Awww, how sweet, we knew these guys would get together.<br/><br/>Then there is the issue of female representation. Gina Gershon is the ball busting ex wife and Warren is that girl from special school who is still wearing nappies. Retards and bit**es. Hmmmnnn.. surely gay men think of women more than this.<br/><br/>The film is not even saved by its special effects. The special effects of the race is tacked on. It seems to jump from a playstation racer game then back to the movie.<br/><br/>Its all just to horrible and only worth watching for its camp value. I give 2 out of 10 and just cannot believe that Kip Pardue is an actor."

In the end I was begging for more info on the incredible lengths that were gone to, to film this eye catching movie.<br/><br/>I am inspired by the work done by the visual effects team and I really think that if you look beyond Sly Stallone's average writing and producing then really this movie will inspire you too. The amount of effort that these guys went to and the breakthough technology that they used is utterly incredible and taking that into account this is a movie that people need to see on DVD to have true respect for it.<br/><br/>Another interesting thing is the way that the crew filmed at many different races and if you look in the credits several famous F1 drivers are mentioned. Jean Alesi and Jacques Villineve (excuse spelling) for a start. Montoya also makes an appearance in the film.<br/><br/>So yeah, maybe this is just a film for car racing enthusiasts like myself. Or maybe for those who are into stunning visual effects that are made using technology that is so unbelieveable that it has to be seen to be believed. It's probably not one for the film crtics as cynicism is part of their job description. Their so into acting and good direction that they look past visual effects, cinemotogrophy and musical score which are also important parts of a movie.<br/><br/>So I'll dare to be different and give it 8 out of 10 and thats coming from a girl who is very keen on car racing."

Some of the contents of this film are completely ludicrous, as has been pointed out by others, but I have to mention that it takes at least two people to start a Champ car, so that rules out the ridiculous Chicago street scene. Also, the physical properties of methanol were ignored. I'll bet the filmmakers knew, or were told, that methanol mixes with water rather than floating on top, but decided to go ahead, figuring moviegoers are all too stupid to know better. Aside from the factual errors, and the over-the-top action and photography/CGI, I thought the actors did well with the material they had to work with. Kip Pardue was nothing to write home about, but I thought Til Schweiger and Cristi√É¬°n de la Fuente did fairly decent work. Even Stallone wasn't as bad as usual.

Also, there is some serious overacting going on in the movie. I for one could not sympathize for any of the characters, and the role of the team owner (Burt Reynolds) has sudden bursts of anger that might lead to serious high blood pressure (which might explain why he is in a wheelchair...).

I haven't read anywhere that Sylvester Stallone has made a similar comment about his script for DRIVEN. But I think it would fit. I just find it disturbing that I had much more difficulty with suspension of disbelief in this supposedly ""realistic"" film directed by Renny Harlin than with Besson's sci-fi/fantasy film.<br/><br/>""Wait til it comes out on video"" is an admonition often heard about under-par films. But I can't really say that about this film because the visuals are about the only things that *are* good and they would be tremendously diminished on the small screen.<br/><br/>What struck me as good about the film? What sticks out? Well, (I don't think this counts as a spoiler) two race cars driving through the streets of Chicago was pretty much the high point of the film - the events precipitating the impromptu ""race"" weren't very believable, but the visuals - trashing of newspaper stands as the cars sped by at 195mph (clocked by a Chicago patrolman) and a Marilyn Monroe homage from THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH and the hot air grate - although the car's passing whipped the skirt up a *lot* higher, stood out. No fruit stands though - Roger Ebert will no doubt be disappointed.<br/><br/>Estella Warren (as Sophia) - who bounces between Kip Pardue (Jimmy Bly - the up & coming novice) and Til Schweiger (current champion) does some great aquatic acrobatics - unless she uses a body double. But that swimming pool scene lasted perhaps a minute - for that to stand out is indicative of so much else in the film that was mundane.<br/><br/>And dialogue? Jimmy & his brother Demille (Robert Sean Leonard) have an arguement where Jimmy blurts out ""Can't you wait a little longer?"" and Demille yells back ""I'm not your waiter!"" That was good for a few chuckles in the audience. Jimmy has an injured leg and as Demille moves off Jimmy shouts ""Don't walk away from me!"" and hobbles after him. Another good laugh from the audience.<br/><br/>Locations in Detroit; Chicago (or at least Cicero, IL); Queensland, Australia; Montreal, Toronto & Vancouver, Canada are legit. The ""German"" and ""Japan"" venues are simulated.<br/><br/>If you like Burt Reynolds, Sylvester Stallone, and Renny Harlin's direction, go for it. But I would recommend doing it at matinee prices. Don't see it on video. The effect would be way too diminished.<br/><br/> Although critic Teddy Durgin has said that the Chicago race sequence was worth the price of admission (but to leave immediately afterwards, as you wouldn't be missing anything . . .

Well, instead he made a stupid love triangle movie set around a racetrack.<br/><br/>I can't begin to say how boring, unrealistic and cheezy this flick gets. You want to watch a bunch of digital race cars and blue-screen drivers? This is the movie for you. I could even live through the love stories if the racing scenes were exciting, but they aren't. Typical of modern movies, instead of spending the money to mount cameras on REAL race cars, you get to watch a computer game where the digital effects are obvious.<br/><br/>It's also a great movie if you like advertising. Watch the last race scene and try to count how many of the car sponsors are flashed across the big screen in 10 seconds.<br/><br/>The film is an insult to autoracing. That being said, the bright side is that there isn't much racing IN the movie so the insult doesn't run that deep. You want bad racing cliches? You got 'em. They obviously didn't hire any technical experts. If they did the drivers wouldn't have been shift gears on oval courses. Somehow the winning racer always had a little more throttle left over for the finish.

Celi has Montand's car arrive late, Reynolds holds Stallone back in pits. Celi, of course, was great, but Reynolds stunned me with the energy he put into this role. 9. Marching band playing on the racetrack. 10. Lots of girls and disco shots. 11. Both Stallone and Garner finish a race with their car in disrepair and about to blow. 12. Both Stallone and Garner are ""washed up"", have alternate careers and get called back to help the team because they know ""how to win"". 13. Lots of feet and clutch shots. 14. Both have an absence (thankfully) of ""real race footage"" interspliced which is obviously not taken anywhere near the subject matter.  See ""Red Line 7000"" for 50's footage in a 60's movie. 15.  A female journalist becomes a love interest.  Eva Marie Saint and Stacy Edwards are both very classy and well cast. 16. In the end the Hero wins, the right man gets to keep the girl (but doesn't win) and the owner appears to have a heart of gold after all. All that being said, if Grand Prix was great, and it was, so is ""Driven"". Oh, sure, the manhole covers and tires go slo-mo in the air (see Jurrasic Park: The Lost World) and some of the CG cars look like a video arcade (or is that the Director trying to make us think that the driver is flashing to his computer simulation...Hmmmm?) but the violence of the wrecks is accurate.  Gina Gershon is the perfect ball-buster X and even she comes around. You can complain about the continuity or other goofs (beach volleyball scene in Detroit has ""Chicago"" in the background, Canadian flag in background of the Detroit or Chicago race, etc.) but the real story is good, remarkably wholesome and has a happy ending where nobody gets killed. Is that bad? No, so go see it... besides that, it is No. 1 at the box office.<br/><br/>Brewski-2"

Screenplay was by Stallone, which explains why the movie had faults. The movie left many questions unanswered, example why did Stallone leave Gina Gershon. Also the part when Estella Warren gets back with Til Schweiger, leaving Kip Pardue without any emotions. And suddenly Kip Pardue runs away with the car. This scene was very lame. There were many scenes like these that made the movie lame in some parts. Other than that, the movie was very entertaining to watch. Races were excellent and direction was also excellent.

This movie didn't have a lot of dialogues to explain the characters' personalities, but by the middle or end of the story, you HAVE and WILL understand the story completely. It was an amazing film with great special effects and characters development. Every characters in there has their own identity and what the writer did was amazing. The writer, ""Sylvester Stallone"", perpetuated the characters' emotions and feelings so well and that was probably the best thing I love about this movie. Never in my entire life has a thriller or drama movie caught me by surprise and astonishment before. If I had to rate this movie from 1 (awful) to 10 (great), this movie deserve a 10 because I couldn't find any big mistake in the movie except for the special effect. When the car went flying and rain pouring onto the driver's helmet, it look so fake not like Stars Wars which has technology beyond our standard. The music and the sound vibrations were just awesome.

","""Driven"" is a movie about life on the Indy Car racing circuit. While the shots of the various racing venues are interesting and colorful, the special effects involving the obligatory car crashes are amateurish and give the film the look of a video game.<br/><br/> Sylvester Stallone (who wrote the screenplay) stars as Joe Tanto a washed up former driver who is called back by race team owner Burt Reynolds to coach the current boy wonder Jimmy Bly (Kip Pardue) to the world championship. Bly is competing against, now get this, Beau Brandenburg (a ""B"" movie name if ever there was one) played by Til Schweiger on the track and for the affections of Sophia (Estella Warren). Stallone's character is not that of the gung ho hero we are used to, but that of a wimp who is ordered about by Reynolds. Reynolds, by the way takes the acting honors in the picture as Carl Henry the team boss. Others in the cast are Gina Gershon (very good as Stallone's ex), Robert Sean Leonard as Bly's scheming brother and Stacy Edwards as Stallone's love interest.<br/><br/> Stallone and Reynolds play what amount to supporting roles. This is the biggest flaw of the movie. The central characters are the younger actors, Pardue, Schweiger and Warren and none are able to carry the picture. That together with the video game effects make this picture a real disappointment."

","After avoiding this film for ages, I finally got around to see it yesterday -and instantly wondered why the hell I didn't get my ass to the theatre to see it on the big screen. This movie has a completely engrossing way of presenting itself, that even I (no fan of motor""sport"") was sucked in and cheered for my favourite drivers. It does what Any Given Sunday did to football films - it shows the people in and around the sports arena. How their lives off the track/pitch affect their performance on it. How there really is no ""good"" or ""evil"", but only people wanting the same thing: to win and excel at their sport.<br/><br/>I know WHY I avoided it. I blame Days of Thunder and other crap car movies. They create small fanasy worlds, where one driver is totally evil, the hero is so much better than everybody else and where the girl will only love him if he wins.<br/><br/>This is a very unfair attitude towards this movie. It is refreshingly unlike Days of Thunder. It shows ordinary people, driven to win, but not necessarily at all costs. We have the rookie, who is completely dominated by his brother/manager and falling apart from the pressure of being famous. We have the German Champion, who dumps his girlfriend the better to focus on his driving - only to discover, that driving ISN'T everything. We have the Support Driver, who naturally isn't ateam player but craves personal fame and the former Star turned Support Driver, who has been changed by a past accident and now tries to see the bigger picture. Combined with the extremely well shot action sequences, that leave you on the edge of your seat (and even got me caring for motor sport for 2 hours), this is quite a solid movie. And it is well worth spending two hours with. Its fun and the races are fantastic.<br/><br/>7/10 (maybe 8, I really was entertained)."
"matt caccamo","5","0","1","5 February 2002"," 2.5 out of 5 stars
","In the first big-budget, Hollywood stab at car racing since `Days of Thunder,' we are given an ESPN-like montage more suitable for SportsCenter than your local multiplex.  Joe Tanto (Sylvester Stallone), a veteran driver with several skeletons in his closet, is brought back to racing by a handicapped, but still shrewd, racing manager (Burt Reynolds) in order to coach a young star (Kip Pardue) to superstardom.  His assignment: teach the kid how to handle the pressures of racing so he can overcome the erstwhile German champion, Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger).  Director Renny Harlin gives us a film that is more Hollywood than Daytona: drivers with playboy looks, beautiful women switching sides like WWF sidekicks, and an endless web of soap opera love stories and past feuds.  Shot in a Bruckheimer-like vision of constantly moving cameras and endless jump cuts, the film is a series of car crashes linked together by short, meaningless conversations and annoying broadcast overplays.  Despite all this, for some reason I wanted to like this film, and, in the end, I did not hate it.  Maybe because it allowed itself the break the rules (with a super-ridiculous higher-than-high speed car chase through downtown Chicago) and play with melodrama (with a sexless love-triangle straight out of the 5th grade). Like car racing itself, the entertainment value is higher than any other remotely redeeming quality."

","I found the finished product to be short of the potential its storyline. The characters tended to be very harsh and they tended to be very open about thier goals.  It made sense for the couple that broke up after three years to be very vulnerable and for the reporter, as a third party, to analyze her observations to Stallone's character.  For Stallone to be so open with the reporter was a bit of a stretch.  The relationship between Kip and Sophia seemed too serious too fast, given her reluctance in the first bar scene.<br/><br/>
The ultimatium which ups the stakes comes over an hour into the movie. Starting there, with a series ultimatium instead of a one-race ultimatium could have built tension that was never came into being through the whole thing.  The title ""Driven"" implies an intensity that was lacking.<br/><br/>There are some techincal issues with stunts being overdone, such as the shot that looks like a flying tire could hit a low-flying airplane and the newspaper rack going flying in the chase scene.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Stallone's monologue after the chase was somewhat rushed.<br/><br/>I desperately wanted to know more about why the brother was so controlling of his younger brother.  That was possibly one of the most intriguing storylines in the thing, and it was almost totally ignored from the standpoint of exposition.  My husband wanted more exposition of Burt Reynolds' character.<br/><br/>The story was that Cathy left Joe when he stopped raising Cain and became a ""nice guy"", but Memo, her new husband, is never shown to be a cainraiser.

I was well aware of the bad rep this movie has, and I was the most eager to see what the big fuss was. You have Stallone, a seasoned action star in a film helmed by Renny (Cliffhanger, Deep Blue Sea) Harlin. Could it really be that bad?<br/><br/>The answer is no. In fact, I found myself getting into the film in many scenes. Unfortunately, the race scenes were the only ones. The race scenes are, in a word, stunning. The effects do go a bit overboard at times, but overall they are loud, well-shot, and most importantly, exciting.<br/><br/>What is so questionable here is the screenplay. Sly wrote the whole shebang, and it shows. These are some of the most paper-thin characters I have ever seen onscreen. We don't really care about the well-being of any of them, which is not good in a story that has many takes on relationships woven around Indy racing. The dialogue is as stale as three month old crackers, and the acting is very sub-par.<br/><br/>But there's always the argument of ""who cares? People will want to see this movie for the race scenes."" Understandable. I think that argument holds up well for Days Of Thunder, another racing film. However, the dry romances and dialogue get in the way of this movie, and that is why it did not fully succeed for me.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is not near as bad as its reputation.

I have high hopes for this movie<br/><br/>For me, the story is not too important for racing movies, as long as the action is good, and for this matter, as close to reality as possible since it is based on real life racing. Too bad, seems that Sly tries to hard to make the action incredible, instead for me it is too much. For me, it seems that Sly needed to watch more F1 race or CART race to represent how real racing happens. There is just too many dramas in this movie, and lack of details of a CART race weekend. The accident is too spectacular (although maybe not impossible in real life, but some is).<br/><br/>Bottom line? Hard core race fans might be disappointed. However, I recommend that they at least see this movie once. There is not much movie about racing, so this movie is still a blessing. For race fans, they might recognized their idols act in this movie.

","I rented this movie last night and, after seeing the horrid reviews it got, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  Nevertheless, I went in with an open mind and I came out quite satisfied.  It was really nice to see a hollywood action flick with heart.  The quick mtv-style editing got on my nerves.  It seems to me, that many of today's directors think that we have the attention span of a gnat (many viewers do) but I'm getting really tired of movies being so choppy, frantically trying to keep our attention.  In some cases of the film it was nice, the action scenes looked great and the fast pace actually helped out.  <br/><br/>I watched the DVD version and I got to see more of what Stallone had in mind.  The film would've ran over four hours long had Sly gotten his way and that would've been fine by me.  I'm glad that I got to see the fifty minutes of deleted scenes which gave the characters a lot more depth and explained their purposes and agendas much more clearly than what was shown in the film.  More is explained about Stallone's character and why he is really called in to help out the rookie.  Also, his actions are more fully explained.  I suppose Renny Harlin is to blame for the choppiness of the whole thing but I don't want to bad-mouth him too much here.  The guy handles his action scenes like a true pro and he does let enough emotion sink in during the dramatic scenes.  It just happens really fast. <br/><br/>
I'm still not quite sure why this movie has been torn apart by the critcs, but they should lighten up a little.  This was, by far, the best action flick I saw all Summer long and I plan on buying the DVD.

","What I hear you say, 'Surprisingly deep'? Indeed, you may not notice it underneath multiple layers of MTV-esque cuts, a thumping and ear-shattering soundtrack, interesting CGI-scenes, scantily clad pitchbabes (probably there as eye candy for the male viewers        ;-)   ) and well, Sylvester Stallone. It is probably still hard to see anything else in him besides Rocky, although he is not all that bad an actor, just check out Copland!<br/><br/>Anyways, as I said, I was surprised by the story. Driven could have easily become an 'all-action-no-character-development'-movie. But a lot of work has gone into creating somewhat complex characters. And what's more, there are no distinct bad or good characters.<br/><br/>Jimmy Bly: Kip Pardue did a nice job as a rookie driver ... tough, vulnerable, insecure, focused, hurt - just a few stages the guy goes through, without ever annoying me! Usually I tend to think 'just get on with it, forget about the whole 'inner-struggle'-thing'. But not this time ... loved the way Pardue handled the role.<br/><br/>Beau Brandenburg: First off, I have to confess I have been a Til Schweiger fan for ages. So seeing him in this movie was pretty cool! And I loved what they did with the Beau-character. Instead of portraying him as the bad guy, which they could have easily done, they showed us a guy who's willing to sacrifice a lot to win a race (even dumping his long-time girlfriend!). Luckily, this didn't happen. We got to see quite a complex guy, who may behave as a complete a*****e, but deep within is a good guy. Wonderful! And I love Til Schweiger showing his vulnerable side ;-)<br/><br/>Joe Tanto: Ah, Sylvester Stallone, for a long time I could not stand the man. Must have been the Rocky/Rambo overdose! But since Copland I have had to adjust my opinion and I like him in this film as well. Never too present he does a nice job as the veteran driver. Obviously, he has a number of issues to deal with, but he does this gracefully, without drawing attention to these issues and using them for gratitious Oscar-moments. Instead, as the movie progresses he seems to come to terms with some of the things that trouble him, although he never quite airs them. He is there to play the role of the father, sort of taking the other, younger drivers by the hand. He helps them or tries to anyway, to avoid the pitfalls that lead to his own demise. And in this process he probably heals himself as well! Well done!<br/><br/>Carl Henry: I am not sure, but this to me looks like one of Burt Reynolds' best performances. Carl Henry is a b****rd! I apologize for the profanity ;-) but it probably describes him best! An easy character to hate, but somehow they pulled the unimaginable off, I still liked the guy! Not an overly complex character I must say, but Reynolds did a great job! And that is not something you will hear me say often about Reynolds!<br/><br/>DeMille Bly: played by Robert Sean Leonard. Well, the manager from hell, and probably the most stereotypical character in this film. Correct me if I am wrong! If one character deserved some underplaying, this was the one. Now I was slightly annoyed and frankly, what kind of brother is DeMille?! Sure, he took care of Jimmy, but that is not something one really deserves extra credit for. You are supposed to take care of family!<br/><br/>And then the female characters. Sophia, Cathy, Luc. They tried to make the male characters as complex as possible, but forgot to do the same for the female characters. But okay, I suppose the ladies are not the focus of the film so I can live with it. The ladies are a bit bland at times, only Cathy (Gina Gershon) manages to show some 'bite'. But well, you could put Gina in a movie without giving her lines and she would still be a presence.<br/><br/>
All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. Fast, funny, exciting, romantic at times. Great acting. Do not forget the cool CGI-effects! The driver's point of view during races is memorable. Sure there are some things that could have been different. Maybe a less loud soundtrack, although I did not really mind all that much, I will probably end up buying it ;-). Maybe the cuts could've been a bit less MTV-esque, but it sort of fits and gave the film a special feel. It reminds me of a live racing coverage, the USPN kind that is and I got into it after a while.<br/><br/>And to imagine I nearly missed out on this movie ... my friends and I were not quite sure whether we should go to Driven or Animal. Think we got the better deal with Driven! So go check it out! Depending on your location: buy it, rent it, or check it out at the cinema ;-)<br/><br/>I gave it a 10/10 in the poll, the low 5.3 rating is just undeserved! My real rate would be 8/10, just so you know!"

"NOSbooster","9","0","1","2 August 2001"," Not an Indy Days of Thunder...
","Going to this movie I expected some awesome action, mild acting, and maybe an indy style ""Days of Thunder"" What I got highly exceeded my expectations. It had some of the best action (car wrecks) I'd ever seen in a movie, it had great acting, definitely one of Stalone's best, but the thing i liked best is that it hardly had anything in common with ""Days of Thunder"" except the fact that it has racing.  Don't get me wrong, ""Days of Thunder"" is one of my fav movies, but I didn't want to see an indy style of it.  This movie delivers...Bottom line.  If you go there for action or romance or drama or acting, its all there. Newcomer ""Kip Pardue"" is the new driver on the circuit ""Jimmy Bly""<br/><br/>This guy has got the acting gig down.  He's very good with acting, and by acting I mean that you can tell he's not just reading from a script, he, as well as all the other characters did a phenomenal job.  One character I thought that didn't have much meaning to the story was<br/><br/>Joe Tanto's (Stalone) Ex wife. She didn't seem to have much of a purpose except to be a total jerk to all the drivers except for her new hubby ""Memo Moreno"" She was great in Face/Off, playing ""Sasha"" this role, however, was not one of her best. Burt Reynolds...All I can say is ""FINALLY""! He needed a good movie since ""Smokey and the Bandit""!  I never really liked any of his work, but he fits the ""Race car teacher/Mentor/Big-Boss"" that this role called for. Model/Actress ""Estella Warren"" did a great job playing the, ""Jump from Racer to Racer"" role,  I think Jimmy's Brother (Robert Sean Leonard) said it best, ""Movin your way up The Pits?"". This was her 2nd movie, and I must say she did a great job, showing that not all hot models are brainless blondes.  I give this movie 3 and 1/2 of 5 stars because it did lack in some areas."
"tp320","9","0","1","28 July 2001"," Dumb, predictable and extremely fun
","When making a film which focuses on a specific hobby/sport (whether it be computers, skydiving or - indeed - racing) it's always hard to come up with ways that makes the situations easy to understand and exciting to the ""average viewer"" while at the same time trying to be realistic enough to satisfy the people who know and follow the hobby/sport. Actually it's not even hard, it seems to be impossible. Considering that, Driven did a helluva job keeping my eyes glued to the screen even though I hate F1/Cart etc. I guess that means that there are numerous factual errors and the fans of Cart-racing will pick this film apart. So be it, I don't care.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you go and see this movie expecting a good plot, good acting and good dialogue, you obviously aren't very bright when it comes to movies and deserve what you're going to get. Of course, there are attempts to make the characters deep and make the audience care about whether they win or not but since there are no clear good and bad guys here, those attempts are largely unnecessary. Instead, you get racing scenes which are filmed so well that they literally take your breath away. The soundtrack is also extremely good with excellent score and songs almost always on the background.<br/><br/>The movie has excellent production values and with it's fast cutting it's style resembles something produced by Jerry Bruckheimer. Nothing wrong with that. I love the frenetic pace, the way the camera is always moving and the way no shot lasts longer than two seconds. Some others don't so if you want to see something subtle, skip this. My favorite scene was a chase through the streets of Chicago (though filmed in Toronto) where the young rookie guided by Stallone steals a prototype race car and heads to the streets with Stallone chasing him. The atmosphere in this scene set during night was out of this world and the sheer irresponsibility of the act was extremely refreshing in this day and age when everything is so politically correct (and at least in Finland speeding seems to be the most serious crime anyone can ever commit) that it makes me sick. There are also numerous good-looking girls throughout the film. You want to see strong female characters? Well you ain't gonna find them here. You want to see some sexy babes showing cleavage? You came to the right place. <br/><br/>Now, I might not be the most objective guy around when it comes to this film. I'm from Finland so I'll probably like anything that Renny Harlin makes. Also, I like Stallone and I like fast cars (although, as I said, I'm not a fan of racing). Still, after the negative hype this movie received in the US, it came as a very positive surprise to me. It's not a total success but it's a fast and fun film if you don't take it too seriously. Fans of the sport might be disappointed but if you want to see fast cars, this just might be the ticket even if you don't like to watch racing on TV. I liked the film and I'll give it an 8. Just don't watch it without a good-quality sound system and a big screen - this is audio-visual entertainment all the way."
"benz6190","Null","0","1","19 July 2001"," Indy, F1 style.
","Personally i loved this movie and thought it was a well deserved follow up to Grand Prix. Even though this movie is mode about the CART series, the characters seem to be based upon members of the F1 crowd. For example: Beau Brandenburg is clearly based on f1 star Michael Schumacher even without mentioning the red suit not to mention the temper and attitude. Jimmy Bly seems a bit like 97 f1 champ Jacques Villeneuve , who amazingly won 4 Grand Prix that season ,during his rookie campaign, when Schumacher was defending his back to back titles , and oddly enough Bly's car owner is wheelchair bound and bears a striking resemblance to Villeneuve's boss who happen to be the one and only Frank Williams who is also in a wheelchair. When you make a racing movie you can't leave out a character resembling the late great Ayrton Senna. Which in this case is played by Cristian de la Fuente as Memo Moreno who happens to have a horrific crash and is almost killed. Actually Moreno was originally supposed to be killed but CART refused to let any of the drivers die in the movie so he was close to death."
"teardown","6","0","1","10 July 2001"," A speedy mixture!
","It is not an easy task to make a movie about Formula 1 or Indycar. How do you put a whole season into a two-hour movie? The makers of Driven made a pretty good job and on top of everything they made Stallone fit in one of the cars. I don't know which of these two are the hardest. It is an average movie which has some minor goofs in it, for example:<br/><br/>* The gravity seems to be turned of when the cars go 20-30 meters up in the sky when crashing.<br/><br/>* The cars are from Indycar, the season are F1, some of the drivers are real Indycar competitors<br/><br/>* The best driver has a very german-touched-name<br/><br/>* Since when does Indycar / F1 have compressed-air lifts in the pits? I always thought it was manual lifts.<br/><br/>Due all the minor goofs in the movie which makes you laugh race the vote from a 6 to a 7."
"NateW","8","0","2","20 June 2001"," Better than it's reputation
","This was panned by a lot of critics and many viewers, mostly because of the love story and the fact that Sylvester Stallone is in it. I think this movie got a bad rap. The love story is rather predictable, but there are many exciting and realistic crash scenes that make up for it. Other than the crash scenes, the overall race sequences are fun to watch. I found it a good racing movie with good performances (yes, even from Stallone). 8/10"
"chainsmoker","1","0","1","20 May 2001"," Not character-DRIVEN
","***WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>Not that Driven wasn't enjoyable at times, but the story was a bit too... sparse. Moreover, Driven suffers from a number of problems: an overabundance of characters, the evaporation of numerous subplots, and way too much ambiguity.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, there are too many characters in this script. Memo Cristi√°n de la Fuente) and Cathy (Gina Gershon) are two such characters; the female reporter Lou (Stacy Edwards) is another. Having Joe's ex-wife Cathy taunt him with her remarriage to Memo not only does nothing for the plot, it's a distraction. Lou's ""love"" storyline with Joe seems to be going somewhere at the start, but then it is more or less dropped, leaving us with only shots of them bonding in montage sequences. And Memo's insecurities and false bravado, while interesting, take away time from the main characters: Beau (Til Schweiger), Jimmy (Kip Pardue), and Joe (Sylvester Stallone).<br/><br/>The script also suffers from ambiguity in other places. When Jimmy meets Sophia (Estella Warren) at a bar after her breakup with Beau, he tells her she's only looking for a friend, and he seems to be okay with that. Yet they seem to develop a relationship without *any* on-screen physical contact. This is a major problem, as it leaves their relationship ambiguous, and confuses the action in the party scene where Sophia leaves Jimmy to go back to Beau.<br/><br/>Overall, while Driven should be recommended for racing/crash enthusiasts, it is not for those who enjoy (pardon the pun) character-driven films. Had the screenwriter (Sylvester Stallone) taken out some of the characters, fleshed out the relationship between some of the more important ones, and resolved any subplots he felt the need to throw in, this script could have been far better."
