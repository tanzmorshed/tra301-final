","This was such a good downgrade, it's unbelievable. The movie doesn't shelter a soul. You can't show feelings to it. It's ugly. There isn't much thought put into it. It's like not a part of the Trilogy: Forced and lame jokes, casual and uninspiring score, stereotyped and predictable plot, cheesy and generic writing, undeveloped villain, inappropriate atmosphere, wrong character development... I mean how does one go from this ''Tell me, do you bleed'' to this ''There's something definitely bleeding'' It's like a 'joke'. Who wrote this garbage? I mean why, what was your motive?<br/><br/>Apart from the garbage writing, the coloring sucked too. The whole movie was ugly as hell. After Superman's resurrection, the fight scene was completely miss edited. Why is the sun rising? Do you guys wanted it to make more colorful? Is because Superman takes his power from the sun? Because of this garbage coloring, the VFX and the CGI looked garbage.<br/><br/>Where is the villain? That villain shouldn't have wasted like that. He made a pretty good entrance, but the movie didn't capitalize on it afterwards. We didn't get to know him. He was in exile, Superman died so he has sent to earth to destroy it. Yeah, sure.<br/><br/>Fight scenes were a big downgrade too. Although there were some good shots, especially where Amazons and Steppenwolf fight, most of the fight scenes were just casual and emotionless.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is just another ''Batman & Robin''. Back then, due to its darkness, they gave Batman nipple. Now, due to its darkness, they gave Batman ''Do you really talk to fish'', ''There is something definitely bleeding'' lines. The history repeating itself.<br/><br/>They gave $300,000,000 for this movie, but it doesn't look like that big of a movie, right? WB really did something. They've disposed of movie's original composers. They've re-edited and rewrote the whole movie. They've brought a new guy, who doesn't care about the characters or bother to know them, as a writer and director to make the movie look more like a Disney movie. And with that guy, they added a bunch of reshoots which doesn't add too much to the movie other than garbageness and a bad CGI mouth. This version of Justice League is just wrong, doesn't add up, doesn't lead anywhere. Every storyline that we started, every future we were building up to gone with this movie. It just depressing."
"TheMovieDiorama","6","89","121","25 February 2018"," Justice League is, unfortunately, plagued with post-production issues.
","Here we are. The Justice League. DC's greatest superheroes come together to save the world...and what is the first scene you ask? Henry Cavill's CGI'd shaved face. Ohhh dear...yup...we're in for quite a ride. So with Superman dead, Batman and Wonder Woman must arrange a team of gifted individuals to stop the world destroyer Steppenwolf from, you guessed it, destroying the world. Sighhhh...I kinda just want to hug this film and repeatedly whisper ""there, there...it'll all be alright."". Apprehensively, I went into this unmotivated and expecting the worst superhero film since Suicide Squad. Fortunately, this isn't that bad. But, it's not great either. The film's greatest achievement is the coalition of the Justice League members. Their interactions, mannerisms and even their physicality was pretty much on point. Aquaman, although absolutely useless in this, had the physical prowess of a beastly underwater warrior. The Flash was quirky and provided several comedic moments. Cyborg was essentially the technological logistics manager. Wonder Woman and Batman were the parents who lead their children into battle. Heck, she even refers to them as children! Yet it all worked so well. Remember, this is a comic book adaptation, so the humour and light hearted nature of its source material does show. The human CGI for the most part was actually executed well (far better than ""Thor Ragnarok"") and the slow motion scenes with The Flash were gorgeous to watch. Snyder is typically style over substance, which is apparent here. The story is so boringly uninspired that it defines the word ""lazy"". I cannot be dealing with another 'save the world' situation. I'm also becoming irritated with underused, bland and weak villains who are supposed to be absurdly powerful. Steppenwolf was wasted potential. Constant use of green screen, hit and miss script, rushed third act...just too many flaws I'm afraid. Was it too soon for a Justice League film considering no origins for Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg yet? Personally, I think so."
"d-beckton","1","409","602","23 November 2017"," Warner Bros. should be ashamed of themselves.
","Everyone knows by now that due to unfortunate circumstances, Zack Snyder (Director) and his wife, Deborah Snyder (Producer) had to leave the project for personal reasons, which enticed to the studio (Warner Bros.) to bring in 'Avengers' director Joss Whedon and ''finish'' it. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the film seems to have been almost completely re-written and re-shot. I've read a fair amount from people claiming that the film is still around 80% Snyder's vision, I don't think so.<br/><br/>The films original composer (Junkie XL) was quickly dispatched and replaced by Danny Elfman (One could argue that a films score makes up 50% of the film, easily).<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's score is completely flat and heartless. There isn't a shred of emotion in a single note. It sounds out of place, is consistently uneven and the little homages to past themes seem to be thrown in and are used at completely the wrong times.<br/><br/>Almost every scene where Superman appears, he has a ridiculously expensive, computer generated botch job of a mouth to cover up a moustache that Henry Cavill wasn't allowed to shave off for the re- shoots, due to commitments to another film.<br/><br/>As I can recall, there was one scene for Superman where he didn't have the CGI mouth.<br/><br/>The tone and atmosphere of Snyder's style is almost completely lifted from the film, something I'm sure was tampered with in post- production.<br/><br/>It doesn't have any kind of atmosphere at all really, it just feels empty.<br/><br/>The actors are all fine and deliver worthy performances for the characters, it's not their fault that the film which is built around them is a complete disaster.<br/><br/>It just goes to show that the studio couldn't care in the slightest about delivering a serious and decent production. They had a release date and they forced themselves to stick to it, regardless of the outcome.<br/><br/>Most of the film feels completely rushed and cheap, which it shouldn't, given it had a budget of $300 million.<br/><br/>It's simply unacceptable for something of this capacity and scale to be the epitome of a mindless product from a bloodsucking and power driven cooperation.<br/><br/>Would it have been such a loss to put the project on hold until Zack and Deborah Snyder returned, or delay the film until everything was as good as could possibly be? Apparently yes.<br/><br/>There's been absolutely no respect for the source material, the vision of the original director or the target audience from Warner Bros..<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's complete version, I'm sure has its faults and flaws, but nothing can compare to this lacklustre effort.<br/><br/>This should have been the best superhero film ever made, but has been dropped and fallen straight to the bottom of the barrel.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but I'll stop there."
"darkmoonuk","1","258","393","21 April 2018"," Incoherent cgi gibberish.
","Might as well watch the cut scenes from a video game, the cgi was poorly implemented. The villain absolutely pointless. Superman's Resurrection wasted, why not give him a few movies to find a villain worthy and build suspense?<br/><br/>Each of the characters in twisted to ape the Avengers in their roles, especially Flash/Spidey but with non of the depth.<br/><br/>Truly a pointless exercise and a wasted opportunity, spare yourself the disappointment. How it is an 8+ on here discredits IMDb<br/><br/>Such a shame. :(<br/><br/>p.s the CGI really is that bad . . ."
"Matrix_Becker","3","335","532","17 November 2017"," What is so expensive?
","I saw the Film last night and i have not an answer for what they need an budget of 300.000.000 USD. Ugly low-detail locations and semi effects. And this is the end of the world? Roland Emmerich would cry for this crap.<br/><br/>the rest of the film is very casual. not the best story so far and the villain is a big joke."
"jayden-carlson2","4","301","486","16 November 2017"," Never thought i'd like BVS more than this, but i do.
","In short:<br/><br/>>Many instances where the CGI and green screens are painfully obvious and stick out like a sore thumb.<br/><br/>>The editing is extremely rushed and abrupt in parts, with super important events such as Steppenwolf stealing the 3rd mother box being mentioned in cringey and obvious exposition by wonder woman, before cutting to a random event halfway around the world.<br/><br/>>The fight scenes in this film are extraordinarily underwhelming. In almost all the fights, barely any of the characters use their powers, with aqua man simply punching and getting thrown away, wonder woman using her sword instead of her OP abilities shown in her standalone movie, and cyborg literally doing nothing except putting his hands inside a glowing box. The end fight was extremely boring and anticlimactic, with the tension immediately disappearing when superman shows up and completely shuts down steppenwolf.<br/><br/>> The villain himself, Steppenwolf, is one of the worst parts of this film. He literally has only one power/ability, which is swinging his pathetic axe around. He is an all CGI uninspired and forgettable villain who isn't menacing in the least. The fight he puts up in the end is disgraceful, with him swinging his axe around a bit then getting completely trashed by superman.<br/><br/>Probably in the minority here, but BVS for me was a 7/10, and this is a 5/10."
"ezramandela","6","224","363","17 November 2017"," WHY Warner Brothers.....WHY?
","The film was okay. Definitely not bad. How I wish Warner Brothers experimented with more standalone films before they finally got to Justice League. As a big DC fan, I was a bit let down. 2hours was definitely not enough to put this film's story across. There were great plot points but everything just seemed to go by too quickly. Henry Cavill's CGI upper lip was very distracting, and his superman- even though I really liked him- but he was just too powerful for Steppenwolf, or maybe Steppenwolf was the one who was too weak for the story they were going for. For someone who wanted to destroy the world, I think he wasn't menacing enough. Ray Fisher was great as Cyborg, I liked Gal Gaddot as Wonder Woman, Mamoa as Aquaman, and even Miller as the flash. But I didn't like how the flash runs in this movie....his legs move in a weird way. Batfleck owned his role obviously. There were great moments in the film, especially when Superman returns and meets the team for the first time. Loved his reunion with Louise and his Mom, and I'm really looking forward to where this universe will go.<br/><br/>The first credits scene didn't do anything for me (I thought they'd both run instead of Superman flying).Many scenes in the trailer were not in the movie, and I feel like there was more to this film than what we get to see. The CGI also needed more polishing. It's definitely getting a lot more hate than it deserves. I really feel sorry for Zack Snyder...I know the backlash he gets from people will definitely affect his confidence as a director, especially for DCEU films and his vision of it. <br/><br/>I give this movie a 6.5/10. An argument can be made for 7/10. Anyone giving this movie more than a 7/10 is not being completely honest with themselves. I really looked forward to this movie, but the theatrical release hasn't done much for me. Definitely a forgettable movie."
"daftdwarf","5","376","637","16 November 2017"," Dull
","Justice League felt like going through a list of specifications with no identity whatsoever. It's not a bad movie per se, it's just extremely dull. Of course there's nothing new in the photo department but that's to be expected, it's kind of an identity for the whole DCEU. I don't like it but hey, that's an artistic choice I won't criticize here, at least it's coherent. But some flaws are more crippling than that. <br/><br/>Every single characterization was a bit off and some of them felt like they were forced, especially Barry Allen. Still, the actors do the best they can with the material so it's not unbearable. <br/><br/>Every situation (and even the chain of events) is so predictable (cliché even) that it gets you out of the movie. This level of ""nothing new"" is damaging to the story as it stops you from caring about anything. And it seems like the producers knew this cause they threw in the mandatory helpless family so that you could sense the danger a bit more. After all, it's just the end of the world, how could you care if there was no kid in immediate danger ? Oh wait... Still, even that falls flat as their scenes (and they're not the only ones) are filled with incoherent behaviors that were put there just so that the plot can go forward. <br/><br/>I attended a screening where the only bursts of joy (or emotions at all) occurred when a new character appeared. Kind of a ""fanboy effect"" that fills you with hope at the sight of one of your beloved comics characters. But the rest of the time, everyone was quite bored and numerous sighs were heard. In a sense, it reassured me as I understood I was not the only one who was disappointed in the movie.<br/><br/>*****The following paragraph might contain a minor SPOILER (depending on what you consider a spoiler)***** <br/><br/>Plus, something else bothered me. But I know everyone won't agree on this one cause it's kind of a speculation. All the points above still stand even if I'm wrong about it. So here it is : Justice League felt like it was a failed attempt to adapt the Avengers in the DCEU. And I'm not talking about the strangely similar theme. Nor am I referring to the tension inside the team before they reconcile that felt like a watered-down version of what we saw in the 2012 movie by Whedon. But the characters are bent so that they match their Marvel counterparts. The Flash takes the place of the slightly weaker and wisecracking Hawkeye, Aquaman clearly corresponds to Thor with his royal and out-of-place persona, Wonder Woman goes through the same soldier- leader dilemma as Cap did and even Batman is slightly changed so that he's closer to Tony Stark (making decisions that make absolutely no sense for the world's best detective that we all know and love). That's a shame cause DC characters are interesting and have a lot more to offer than a mere copy. <br/><br/>*****END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER*****<br/><br/>As of 11/16/2017, this movie has an 8.1 score here on IMDb. Now I'm not a hater and won't say it's the worst movie in history but more than 8 ? Seriously ? It barely does the job so it's a 5 out of 10 for me."
"Zingbot_9000","2","242","407","28 November 2017"," A better video game then movie
","Believe me I wanted to love this movie. I grew up on the Justice League. I love the Justice League. This movie was exactly how I would not do it. Let me begin my review.<br/><br/>CGI – I also love CGI. I think we've made some great movie magic with CGI. Here the CGI was so distractingly bad I could not stop wondering how could they do such a bad job with such a huge budget? Let me start with the bad guy – Steppenwolf. The Character looked like it was lifted right out of a video game. He did not look real at all. Honestly this movie looked like they took the Human Actors (plus half and half Superman – I'll get to that) and plopped them right into a video game. It looked like these actors all stood in a sound stage and punch and kicked and jumped. The CGI was so bad the movie lost all sense of realism. It did not help that the directors of this movie has no idea how to put more than 2 characters in a fight scene at any time. Again this took away from the realism also – how do our super heroes fight the alien villains in the middle of a city and not one bystander is in any of the scenes. The world is being destroyed but no one is watching or no one tries running away. Its funny because at one point in the middle of a big fight scene Lois Lane just shows up but no one else including Police or Military does. I sat there in total shock thinking how could some one make such garbage fake scenes. But the most laughable part of the CGI has to do with Superman. I sat there looking at him the whole movie thinking what is wrong with him, he looks off. So afterwards I read that Henry Cavill was filming another movie at the same time as this and in that other movie he was required to have a mustache and beard. So they filmed all his scenes with a beard and CGI'd them out. And it was a terrible job of CGIing the beard out. His face looked off and at points I wondered if it was even Henry playing Superman or a look alike. It was bad and for a movie this BIG it should have been so much better.<br/><br/>As for the other Heroes here are my thoughts, but first let me comment on something that bothers a lot of Justice League fans, why did they take all the color and make these movies so dark. This is a big factor on why Marvel makes much better movies than DC. Look at the costume of Batman (all black), Wonder Women/Aquaman/Superman colors dimmed to the point of their outfits are basically black also. Flash looked OK.<br/><br/>Batman – Ben Affleck seems to be sleep walking through this movie. He is boring boring boring. Enough said about him.<br/><br/>Aquaman – was Aquaman even in this movie? I recall Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, and some cyborg guy, but was Aquaman in this movie? Cuz there was some dude that says Bro and Bruh with long hair and a bunch of tattoos. Jason Momoa was not Aquaman. Not only in persona/appearance, but Aquaman did not use his Aqua skills the entire movie. It was like the director has no idea how to pull this off. He was in the water at the beginning a little when he wasn't drinking his big beer and acting all tough like a pirate/surfer at some pub. But not once did Aquaman used his Aqua skills in this movie. In fact, both of the Justice League fight scenes there was no water around. I am not sure what was worse the CGI or Aquaman.<br/><br/>Flash – I hear some liked him but I could help wondering was Woody Allen not available at the time of filming? Because the guy who played Flash was trying to be Woody Allen the whole movie. Flash was supposedly the funny one – either him or Aquaman, but neither made me laugh once.<br/><br/>Cyborg – Actually Cybrog made me laugh when Steppenwolf pulled off his arms and legs. I laughed out loud at that one. Actually I never knew who cyborg was but from watching this movie he was a fish out of water just like Aquaman. Cyborg apparently deals with Cyber-crimes. Only problem Steppenwolf is from the past and doesn't use computers so Cyborg was useless.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman – The best thing about this movie. No complaints here other than her black Wonder Woman outfit.<br/><br/>Superman – touched on him earlier. I like Henry Cavill and like his Superman portrayal. He wasn't the best here as he wasn't give much to do. He had a couple heart felt scenes (with Lois and his Mom) and CGI withstanding he looks OK for Superman although he looked small in this one.<br/><br/>As for the plot, bad guy from the past wants to destroy the world. Typical but not executed very well.<br/><br/>After seeing this movie I could not help but wish they would blow this whole thing up and start over. They hint of the next movie and I just thought – too bad. DC needs to look at what Marvel is doing and copy, please copy. I also saw Thor's movie and that movie was 1000 times better. Take my advice and see Thor instead. A bad movie like this does not deserve to make the kind of movie it is making."
"luan-penna","Null","539","968","16 November 2017"," Just okay
","I grew up watching the Justice League animated series and I enjoyed every DCEU movie so far, so I was really excited to finally see these heroes together for the first time on the big screen. Unfortunately, the movie was a letdown. It's not bad by any means, but it was not as epic as it should have been. Here are my pros and cons:<br/><br/>Pros: <br/><br/>+ The acting is really good <br/><br/>+ Great chemistry between the League<br/><br/>+ Some good action scenes (Amazons vs Steppenwolf is one the best moments of the movie), even though the movie lacks any memorable action like the ones in Man of Steel, BvS or Wonder Woman <br/><br/>+ Superman is finally done right<br/><br/>+ There are some fun scenes<br/><br/>+ The Flash is great and you can't ignore Wonder Woman every time she's on screen. Aquaman and Cyborg were fine. Batman was fine as well (Ben Affleck didn't look very interested in this movie as he was in BvS) <br/><br/>+ The post credit scenes are great<br/><br/>Cons: <br/><br/><ul><li>The plot is weak (bad guy wants to destroy the world, just like The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Man of Steel, Suicide Squad, X-Men: Apocalypse, etc). You can tell how it all ends, everything is very predictable </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The villain is really awful. I didn't fear him for a second </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Not a lot of surprises </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The VFX is a letdown compared to Man of Steel and BvS (Superman's erased mustache is really distracting)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Very little character development </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>You can tell basically all the scenes added in reshoots</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The jokes didn't work. Most of them are silly, not funny </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gal Gadot's acting is not very good in some scenes. It looks like she is as good as her directors. With Patty Jenkins (Wonder Woman's director), she was great. Here with Zack Snyder/Joss Whedon, not so much </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some of the dialogues are really bad (like the ones with Mera and Aquaman). Half of them are pure exposition </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The movie lacks stakes or any sense of danger </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The final battle is really generic </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The movie is never really exciting. It's almost exciting, but never really really exciting.</li></ul><br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, but it's not great either. Unfortunately Justice League is just okay. You won't remember it in a year. I didn't love the movie, but based on the last post credit scene, I'm excited for where this universe can go next."

","Funny that at least half of these positive reviews were made by a week-old,fresh accounts.These ""fans"" will always get mediocre movies as long as they protect them.Anyway,this is the 4th time of DCappointment.(w.woman was good). DC has officially become MCU 2.0.DC fans are criticizing MCU movies for obvious reasons.Yet they praise J.league even though it is just like a typical marvel/MCU movie. DC has become the very thing that DC fans hate and criticized over years. Villain was so weak,flash and aquaman were cringe(especially flash),pacing was so fast. The comedy was so forced and jokes were bad placed. Some people thought that they should make flash,cyborg,aquaman solo movies before the JL in order to develop the characters.And those people were absolutely correct.Those 3 characters really lacks development.

"Nevermore333","2","320","568","20 November 2017"," This series is so easy to get right and they keep doing all the wrong things.
","If you are going to create a cinematic universe, why not start with solo movies? This movie and BVS are the product of a studio with no patience. <br/><br/>SPOILERS! <br/><br/>1) Terrible Character Development: <br/><br/>This studio gave us no backstory to Wonder Woman and Batman when BvS arrived in theaters, so it flopped. Once again we get no backstory to Aquaman, Cyborg, or Flash. Even Batman hasn't had a solo movie in this DC universe. How do you decide to reboot Batman and you don't even have a solo movie for its central character?! We see this same problem with Suicide Squad. Rushed ensembles with no true backstories and character development. <br/><br/>2) Flashbacks to Mortal Kombat Annihilation:<br/><br/>The scene in Atlantis with Aquaman and Mera was cringe x10. The CGI was abysmal and the dialogue exchange between them was even worse. Luckily, James Wan is directing the solo movie (a good director), so there is still hope. I get the feeling that any solo movie will be great, just as long as Zack Snyder has nothing to do with it. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman was a great solo movie, then she is thrown into this embarrassment of a movie and her acting becomes flat and unemotional. I blame the director. Ben Affleck just looked so bored throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Cyborg's CGI was stuck in the beta phase. It was so bad. Even 1980's Robocop looked better than this. <br/><br/>3) One Mother Box to Rule Them All<br/><br/>The plot was a literal rip off of Lord of The Rings. One box is given to the Atlantians, another to the Amazons, and the final box is given to man. And man must bury the box at an undisclosed location so that they don't become corrupted. In the movie, modern science has no idea how the box is even supposed to work, so I am not sure how a medieval peasant would figure it out. I'm not even sure in what way they would become corrupted since a single box is completely useless. <br/><br/>Steppenwolf looks like Sauron and he must gather the boxes to unlock their power. <br/><br/>What an incredibly lazy plot. <br/><br/>4) Your hero is only as great as its villain <br/><br/>How do you top fighting a colorless CGI monster with no important backstory or presence in BvS? You get the heroes to fight another colorless CGI monster with no important backstory or presence! <br/><br/>There's nothing cerebral or cunning about Steppenwolf. Just a big guy that likes smashing things with a giant hammer. In the comics, he looks human. Why couldn't they at least have a person instead of a CGI monster? <br/><br/>I'm just going to watch the solo movies from now on. I feel like Justice League 2 will add on more heroes with zero backstories, to fight another colorless giant CGI monster with zero backstory and simplistic motivations."
"VVMini","2","284","504","18 February 2018"," There is so much wrong with this movie, it's difficult to know where to start.
","Let's start with the most obvious weakpoint: the villain. Steppenwolf is a laughably bad villain, ripped straight out of a 90ies direct-to-DVD film. He is just a big bland CGI character with absolutely no personality whatsoever. He has no motivation other than being the generic evil guy trying to destroy the world. Apparently it's not even hís plan. If I understood correctly, he's the henchman for some other character that we never learn anything about. His entire design was just uninspired, and he looked and sounded more like a weaker version of the Beast from the live action Beauty and the Beast than one of the strongest characters in the world, hellbend on creating destruction. <br/><br/>Then there are the problems with the entire way that DC is approaching these movies. Making this an ensemble movie, just like with Batman v Superman, feels entirely unearned and a cynical attempt to cash in on the widespread brand recognition of Batman and Superman, and to a slightly lesser degree Wonder Woman, and of course the success of Marvel. It's really hard to look at this film and not conclude that this is DC's failed attempt at creating their version of The Avengers. <br/><br/>However, whereas The Avengers' meetup felt natural, having been build up throughout its previous 5 movies, Justice League decides to introduce half of the entire league in just this movie. This makes most of the first half of the movie an uneven and boring bunch of random character introductions. Only Wonder Woman and the segments on Themyscira felt natural, because we were already introduced to their culture before and therefore had some connection to them.<br/><br/>The rest of the Justice League itself is also lackluster. Jason Momoa's Aquaman was kinda interesting, but it once again feels incredibly cynical that they would introduce the character in this movie instead of in his own one, just because they knew that it would be hard to get people excited for an Aquaman standalone movie without an introduction to the character first. They don't care that it's to the detriment of the quality of this movie, it's just a way too get people to buy into a future film, exactly as they did with Wonder Woman. In this case they actually would have done well to look at Marvel, as they were able to introduce obscure and silly looking/sounding characters like Ant-Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy in standalone movies, and make it a critical and commercial success.<br/><br/>Cyborg was just boring and uninteresting. He has no personality, there's nothing to his character, because there was not enough time for a proper introduction. Even his suit is making the decisions for him sometimes. The CGI was also quite distracting, as his face looks rather fake.<br/><br/>And of course while The Flash has been around for a long time, I find it hard to believe that they would have introduced his character the way they did without the success of Spider-Man in 2016's Civil War. He's pretty much an exact copy of Spider-Man, playing the teenage boy that is overenthuastic about being a superhero, and deriving humor from that.<br/><br/>They even found a way to make Batman look uncool. He's pretty much just collecting the team for most of the movie, and does very little on his own. What is most disappointing is that Ben Affleck is never really Bruce Wayne. Whenever you see him dressed normally on screen, it's just him doing Batman stuff without his suit on. Even Wonder Woman has a scene of her being Diana Prince, but it's all only Batman throughout. <br/><br/>Then there's Superman, whose return was very poorly done. First of all, if you have a character that is supposedly dead, don't make the actor's name the second one to pop up on the opening credits. That's a surefire way to ruin any potential surprise about his return. Of course that return was inevitable and obvious, but at least put in a little bit of effort to hide that fact. I don't even have to put in spoiler tags in here because DC doesn't even consider his return a spoiler.<br/><br/>Secondly, because his return was so quickly - halfway through the chronological follow up to the movie in which he died - there is absolutely no relief or emotional climax to his arc, or any sense of urgency, really. You never really care that Superman's death has supposedly thrown the world in disarray, because his death barely has had any time to have resonated with the viewers. Hell, his supposed death didn't even make it through the end of the previous movie without some hint of his upcoming return. <br/><br/>If they had some patience and balls, they would have had him stay dead for a few films, preferably those in which the rest of the Justice League got introduced, and in which the threats get increasingly challenging and hard to overcome due to Superman's absence. This way when he finally does return after the rest of the League is facing a truly frightening and unstoppable enemy, his come-back would feel earned.<br/><br/>Overall, there's so much wrong with this movie that although I wrote so much, there are still many flaws left untouched (like Zach Snyder being Zach Snyder doing too many Zach Snyder things, or the nonsensical process of resurrecting Superman that actually put them in more danger than before). It's amazing that after the disaster that was Batman v Superman, they went pretty much the exact same route for its follow-up, setting up an illogical and unearned conflict and resolving it in a cliched and nonsensical manner.<br/><br/>At least Batman v Superman had some really cool action scenes instead of the uninteresting CGI fest that was Justice League. And while Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor was a terrible villain, I'd take him over the soulless CGI monstrosity that is Steppenwolf any day of the week. Justice League is a terrible movie in every regard, and really does not bode well for the future of DC's cinematic universe."

","You have to feel sorry for DC Comics.<br/><br/>Sure they've made more than a bucket load of cash with many of their releases, including of course this year's box office behemoth and critical darling Wonder Woman, but overall the company has been living in the shadows of Marvel for a number of years now and have been late to the party when it comes to superhero team-up events until now.<br/><br/>Suffering a troubled production that saw original director Zack Snyder depart the project late in the piece due to a family tragedy and replaced by Avenger's mastermind Joss Whedon, Justice League has had a far from smooth run to cinemas, that includes the fact we've never truly been properly introduced to its new main players, Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg, with DC keen to get this ensemble together as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>Considering all of this, Justice League is not what I'd call a ""bad"" movie, in the sense that I'd warn everyone against seeing it, but this often jumbled and sometimes just not that interesting blockbuster is still far from the all-round winner DC would've been hoping for with Snyder and Whedon's film lacking both a genuinely good story arc (new villain Steppenwolf is just generic baddie 101 or even worse) and any true memorable set-pieces or set-ups.<br/><br/>At what feels like a fairly brisk 120 minute runtime, Justice League is always on the move as we initially get to witness the first meetings between this collection of new friends (the highlight of which is probably Ezra Miller's pizza eating Barry Allen/The Flash) but with so many people, so many different arcs to play out, Snyder and Whedon struggle to bring it all home and action scenes often feel haphazard, some scenes feel rushed or unwanted (a Russian family is given far too much screen time), while all the films colourful characters don't get the airtime they perhaps needed.<br/><br/>After the middling response so far to his take on Batman, Affleck won't be gaining or losing too many supporters here, the verdict is well and truly still out on Cavill's take on Superman, while Gadot is once again great as Wonder Woman. Of the new cast Miller is a fine addition as the awkward Allen, Jason Momoa gives fans hope that his standalone Aquaman will be a lot of fun, while it's surprising just how affecting Ray Fisher is as Cyborg even if his character doesn't seem cut out to get his own standalone feature.<br/><br/>It's a shame then that we don't ever feel like this team is given the scenarios they needed to really gel together. There's chemistry to be found here, even Cavill and Affleck benefit from the likes of Gadot and the new additions, their rather tiresome portrayals enlivened by the fresh, energetic nature of their co-stars but overall the film lacks an energy or pizazz that would've been the kicker to elevate this genuine middle of the road experience to something else entirely.<br/><br/>Final Say – <br/><br/>All in all huge fans of DC will be kept happy with this sometimes enjoyable, sometimes downright bad big screen culmination of hero's and one badly CGI'd and generic villain.<br/><br/>Devoid of anything of true note and without a memorable set-piece, Justice League is unquestionably the poor cousin of The Avenger's but with the talented cast involved, there is enough hope here to suggest that this band of hero's have some room to grow into something special if all the stars align.<br/><br/>2 1/2 terrorised Russian families out of 5"

","Hey, don't go with high expectations, the movie is far away from epic, but it's pretty fine and funny, I enjoyed a lot of stuff, the characters are awesome! Even Steppenwolf isn't the lame they said, he is just not memorable, he's OK, a generic villain who delivers what everyone should expect (come on, it's Steppenwolf, why would you guys expect a mind blower villain here?) The plot is simple and works. The only fatal flaw for a huge fan of DC is the return of Superman, damn, that's was sooo weird :/ And Zimmer would be so much better than Danny was, buuut there's nothing we can do about it now, at least it's nostalgic."
"lebron_jawad","1","4","4","17 June 2020"," DC should've copied Marvel afterall
","We all know about almost every DC character there is but we can never relate to any of them in the movie. What marvel did was that they gave us a proper insight to their characters with a briliant and connected chain of events. They started with Iron Man and gave us a big showdown in a form of Endgame. We knew the Avengers. We could sympathize with them. We all knew what they were fighting for. We knew what all of them went through and what led to the final battle. Their actions and betrayals were somehow justified, credit goes to the studios obviously.<br/><br/>Justice League should've been DC's final showdown because they started so well with Man of Steel. I am one of the biggest comic book fanatics and even I wasn't excited for this movie. Nobody knows what went wrong with that. It was so predictable, dreary, and dragged. There was no character development. Bad comic timing followed by cringeworthy dialogues and action sequences.
How many times do we have to make them realize this simple fact that BATMAN IS NOT GOOFY. Also, Ezra Miller is a great actor but he was truly horrible as Flash. As a comic fan and most of y'all will agree, Flash is goofy BUT badass at the same time. He is not an ameteur and a dumb superhero who has no idea what he is doing.<br/><br/>In my opinion, they rushed into this. I think the following movies should've been released before they did Justice League and also in the same order:
1. Man of Steel
2. Batman Solo Movie (included teaser of Flash)
3. Wonder Woman (included teaser of Aquaman 'cause flashpoint.. well)
4. Batman v. Superman (could've been much better but I still loved it. Included teaser of Justice League but not in a way that happened in the actual movie.)
5. Flash Solo Movie
6. Aquaman Solo Movie
7. Man of Steel 2
8. JUSTICE LEAGUE<br/><br/>I think they needed atleast 7 movies for a proper character development but, well, studios weren't paying attention to the viewers. Disappointed. I hope they will make it up to the fans with Snyder Cut.
Fingers crossed!"

","I wanted to love this movie, but it suffers from the same mistakes as Batman v. Superman. The plot is jumpy and incoherent, the motivation for the characters are sloppy, and the CGI is lackluster at best. Plus, Henry Cavil's face looked off in this move; you can tell they did a bad job removing his mustache. This movie wasn't all bad though. I think the characters and their interactions with each other are the best thing about this movie, but the characters are failed by a terrible script and choppy editing. This movie also has a villain so boring that even Marvel would be jealous. I think Warner Bros. need to make big changes to the DCEU or it's doomed to fail."

","My rating of 1 does not indicate of how bad the movie quality is rather my disappoint with the ultimate result. My review doesn't comes out as a pure hate machine but rather due to the epic disappointment of one might feel after waiting for so long to witness the most epic team up quite possibly of this century to turn into a mediocre generic film.<br/><br/>This should've been the most epic saga in DCEU's continuity but alas rushing to compete with Disney finally took a toll on this franchise. The characters are well enough on their own but their development as individuals are rather paltry. The cinematography is awkward at times as evident from multiple re shoots done by Joss Whedon.<br/><br/>The CGI in some parts are terribly glaring to avoid and it feels too much green screen effect that makes your head hurt while watching in a dark room. Some are too bright while some are too dark. The color grading is very inconsistent with the background. As you all know Superman returns from the dead (which is kinda given at this point) but his resurrection isn't handled well enough. What should've been the rekindling of the hope people lost like the Rebirth of a Phoenix is marred by botched character interactions and idiotic dialogues. <br/><br/>The supporting characters such as Mera, Martha Kent and Alfred are wasted even further. One of the most highlighting parts of BVS was the interactions between Alfred and Bruce engaging in both morally and logical decisions. Sadly it's been reduced to banal banter between them and others. I'm not going to highlight the humor since it's overdone and doesn't fit organically in this film narrative. Humor is good and should be present but not forced and overstuffed like Disney films recently have become. <br/><br/>The villain is generic along with musical score by Danny Elfman which is just rehashing of the same old stuff. Wait for the 4K or bluray release to see edited scenes as consistent with DC's film which might be better."
"garethvk","6","180","331","15 November 2017"," Better Than Expected But Deeply Flawed
","The long anticipated ""Justice League"" has finally arrived finally combining the biggest stars of the DC universe into one film. The proposed film has faced many obstacles on the way to the big screen ranging from script issues, massive reshoots and a change of Director for said reshoots due to a family tragedy that Director Zack Snyder suffered.<br/><br/>The film follows Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Godot), as they look to assemble a team of other gifted individuals to help fight off a pending invasion. The death of Superman has left a void on the Earth, and this has paved the way for an ancient evil to return as he attempts to conquer the planet after he collects the three needed artifacts that his plan requires.<br/><br/>In a race against time, Batman and Wonder Woman recruit Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller), and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), to battle to save the planet. Naturally they battle amongst themselves as well as their massing enemies but ultimately decide on a dangerous plan that can tip the odds in their favor and save the day.<br/><br/>The action in the film is good but it often plays out like a video game. With so many blatantly obvious CGI backgrounds, the movie looked like a video game. There were numerous scenes that looked like they were lifted from Injustice and Injustice 2 that I muse d to myself that someone must have used their Power Up for the shot. Affleck and Gadot are good and work well with one another, but there are some serious casting issues with the film. The biggest for me was Ezra Miller as The Flash. I did not like his effeminate, nerdy, socially awkward, and neurotic and at times cowardly take on the character. This is not the Barry Allen I grew up reading in comics or the one that has been portrayed twice in a much better fashion on television. His comic relief status grew old fast and his character really offered little to the film.<br/><br/>It has been well-documented that Joss Whedon not only handled the rewrites for the film but took over directing duties to complete the film. You can see elements of his humor scattered throughout and the film does move along at a steady pace without dragging.<br/><br/>The biggest issue is that so many of the characters are just stiff and one-dimensional. They really are not overly interesting so it is hard to really connect with them and the tasks they are facing. Unlike Marvel who have excelled with dysfunctional groups who fight amongst themselves as well as the forces of evil, this group seems to be going through the paces rather than being fully engaged with the task at hand and each other.<br/><br/>In the end ""Justice League"" is better than I expected, and the two bonus scenes in the credits show some interesting potential down the road. As it is, it is flawed entertainment that requires audiences to overlook a lot of issues. 3 stars out of 5"
"travishouze","5","173","321","16 November 2017"," ""Justice"" is Still Not Served
","I'm not a DC hater, nor am I a Marvel fanboy, and it's sad i have to start my review like this. I want DC to give Marvel some healthy competition while carving out their own identity, however Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and Suicide Squad haven't given me hope. I had a good time with Wonder Woman but Justice League will be the deciding factor of it was one lucky shot or the beginning of correcting old faults.<br/><br/>Justice League takes place after the death of Superman as the world mourns, despite 70% of the world hating him how i remembered. A strange being by the name of Steppenwolf emerges and searches for three Mother Boxes that can bring a extreme level of destruction to the world. Bruce Wayne and Diana realize they can't do it all alone, so they bring a team together to fight and save the world.<br/><br/>As this is was a first time introduction to Cyborg, Aquaman and The Flash, the film does show they have some good chemistry back and forth with the team as they all individually show off their powers to help in a fight. Ezra Miller as The Flash in particular brings a lot of personality and Wonder Woman brings a sense of big sister keeping the little brothers together. Yes, we do get a moment with Superman and does lead to a fairly rousing moment.<br/><br/>But how does the villain feel on screen, well, honestly, STEPPENWOLF IS BORING. There is no character no clear motivation to why he is doing the things he is and proves that super villains just don't translate to live action (see X-Men: Apocalypse as a example). Also Cyborg, is interesting as his backstory seems, we never see it all come to play. The visuals are very much Zack Snyder, and at the same time there is a strangely over sexualized tone to Wonder Woman in how she is filmed (with occasional upskirt shots, and a lot of focus on her back) and poses the argument of the ""male gaze"" on several occasions.<br/><br/>To me, applauding Justice League for not sucking as much is like applauding a D student for getting a C on a final test. While there are moments of fun, some solid chemistry between the leads, i still feel like we still are a far distance for Justice to be truly served for the DC Extended Universe.<br/><br/>Also, there is a couple post credits scenes. One of them is a kind light hearted moment, and the other.....well go see and find out."

","A lot of people think that DC creates grim and serious stories, and Marvel creates bright and ridiculous. Of course it's not true, because for decades of existence of both publishing houses they have created many stories in different genres and stylistics. So it happened that in recent years we saw cheerful movies from Marvel and serious from DC. Partly for this reason many people have so negatively perceived lighter tone of Justice League.<br/><br/>But a problem of the movie is not that the tone was replaced, but that it constantly changes throughout the all picture. Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon shoot absolutely differently and these distinctions are very noticeable."
"dwarves-36003","1","172","324","21 November 2017"," A way too serious, totally generic, bland action film that thinks its a superhero movie.
","When you think superhero films, you probably remember such hits as Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Avengers. The last thing that comes to mind is any DC movie that has come out in recent years. Many people thought that after the end of the Dark Knight Trilogy that we would see a resurgence in the DC nostalgia that made the company bigger than Marvel at one point. <br/><br/>Those hopes were dashed when Man of Steel turned out to be a dark, gritty CGI mess that tried way too hard to be relevant. The moody and drab undertone of the film made us feel to glum to remember the old Saturday morning cartoons that were filled with fun, adventure, and action all rolled into one brilliantly performed show. <br/><br/>Next was Batman v Superman which had been hyped for three years, and all we got was eight minutes of fighting and over two hours of talking and exposition that we just didn't care about. Suicide Squad was lacking in the department of character development. Instead the producers wanted big names and flashy effects to sell the movie. That didn't work. <br/><br/>Finally, we have this: take all the previous DC movies mentioned (Except the Dark Knight Trilogy, the only films DC got right), put it in a blender while adding aqua man, flash, and cyborg, blend it all together, then turn off the lights. The resulting disaster is Justice League. This is what you don't do with superhero films. It would be like Joss Whedon making the Avengers in 2005 with Iron man being made eight years later.<br/><br/>The movie does not follow any of the source material, instead relying on Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot to carry the weight of the film. Everyone else just seems to be along for the ride with none of the other characters getting their own movie yet, so we have no idea what their motivations for joining the Justice League are. <br/><br/>The film once again goes into dark and gritty territory with everything happening at once with little to no previously known information about half the main characters. Anyone who isn't a comic book junkie was asking ""Why is there a robot and a fireman in this scene?"" Just another too serious flick that betrays the source material and hopes that big Hollywood names will save it (Spoiler alert: they don't)."

"frederikbarndorff","3","113","210","16 November 2017"," The epic film we all hoped for? Not exactly
","Finally the Justice League movie has arrived. Some of us have waited all of our lives for this film, but is it any good?<br/><br/>Justice League is directed by Zack Snyder and stars Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Henry Cavill, Cieran Hinds, Jason Mamoa, Ezra Miller, Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons and J.K. Simmons. The story picks up where Batman V Superman left us. After the death of Superman the world has descended into chaos, but it's only the beginning. An alien invasion is on it's way led by the ruthless Steppenwolf. Now our heroes must put their differences aside and work together to save the planet!<br/><br/>It's well known that this film had a very difficult production. Zack Snyder had to step down do to a family tragedy and Joss Whedon took over and did some rewrites and shot extra scenes. One of my biggest fears going into this film was that it would feel like to different movies into one. With to different directors with each there distinct style it definitely was a risk, but i would say that it's not the case. Justice League feels like it's one director's vision, luckily. <br/><br/>But still this film suffers from a lot of problems. If you have been following my account for a while you will know that Justice League is one of my most anticipated films of the year. I also liked most of the other DCEU films, but sadly Justice League is a step down in my opinion. My main complaint and the biggest issue with it is that it feels very rushed in it's storytelling. A lot of conflicts are set up extremely quickly and therefor you don't feel the emotion that clearly was intended from the director. The rumor going around is that Warner Bros. mandated the films 2 hour run time, and in a lot of instances it feels like something is missing. Even whole scenes feels like they are missing. Also the CGI in this film Sometimes looks very bad and this takes you out of the movie sadly. These are the main complaints i have. <br/><br/>As for the positives there are still a lot of great things here. The new characters of Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg are all portrayed very well and, though rushed, compelling characters. Especially Ezra Miller's Flash provides a lot of the humor. This is another good thing for some. Surprisingly Batman delivers a lot of the humor and i think it suite his character in this film. Justice League is a quite funny film and much more lighthearted than previous installments of this franchise. Sometimes though this becomes too much as the films lacks the seriousness that films like Wonder Woman had. The film is definitely best in the first half. I think the death of Superman is handled very well in the first act. The team dynamic is also a clear positive. The members have interesting arguments and conversations that we didn't get enough of. And when the team is United and start fighting, it's exciting for any fan to watch! <br/><br/>To sum up my thoughts Justice League is overall a disappointment. It feels rushed in almost every way and the story and film as a whole suffers from it. Also Steppenwolf as the villain feels like your everyday disposable Marvel villain like Malekith. There still are good things to see in this film and while watching i was entertained, but Justice League should have been much better. The first time this legendary team is on screen should have been an epic moment but it wasn't. Sadly.<br/><br/>Final rating: 6/10"

","I wasn't too sure about 'Justice League', but was assured that it was the sort of movie we liked, so off we toddled. <br/><br/>There are clearly gaps in our knowledge of super hero recent events. Mebbe they were on Fox. Anyway, Superman is dead! How the hell did THAT happen? Who is Cyborg? When did Khal Drogo eschew the steppe for the deep?<br/><br/>The earth is under attack. No surprises there. This time it's Steppenwolf and a host of dodgy CGI's. Steppenwolf looks to be your standard or garden earth imperiler. I don't know why he is called Steppenwolf. Hermann Hesse might. Dunno. Haven't read it.. Logic would indicate that it was to segue into ""Born to be Wild' but it didn't and the movie is the poorer for it.<br/><br/>Steppenwolf is looking for three mystic boxes to put together to bring something that might be his mother back to rule the universe. I think. One was held by the Amazons, one by the Atlanteans, and one by a Russian farmer with a shotgun. Batman sets about putting together a team to defeat Steppenwolf. There is Aquaman, Cyborg, the Flash and Wonder Woman. But the Wolfster can go a bit and they are overmatched. To be fair, it's hardly your superhero 'A' team. They decide to bring Superman back from the dead. As you do. I thought that it was lucky that he hadn't been cremated then slapped myself for my stupidity.<br/><br/>Superman is bought back from the dead! <br/><br/>It was my fervent hope that he 'S' on the outfit would be changed into a 'Z' and his vocabulary would have been reduced to one word; and that word would be 'Brains' but alas, the 'Doom of ZombieMan' was to be a dream unrequited. It starts off promisingly enough with Superman being confused and very cross about recent events and generally smiting hither and thither but Lois Lane turns up and he, Superman, rogers her and gets over his temporary death and subsequent resurrection. The Justice League, now with Superman coming off the bench, set about saving the world. <br/><br/>Is it any good?<br/><br/>Nope. It's crap. Think 'Interstellar' in tights.

"shreyanhota","4","102","191","20 November 2017"," A Zack Snyder film that Joss Whedon tried to clean up - and it shows. What a mess!
","As we all know, Zack Snyder (BvS) has a very different vision of superhero movies than Joss Whedon (Avengers). This movie felt like a mish-mash of both incompatible styles. Scenes just happen without any connectivity, the plot is so generic it could have been written by a 5-year old. The attempt by WB Studios to Marvel-ise the movie by bringing in Joss Whedon and shoe-horning in comedy elements is nauseating. Yes, Flash has his comedic moments, but they feel very out of place. Superman's jokes are just out of character for what has been established. <br/><br/>This should not please BvS and Man of Steel fans, nor should it please Marvel fans who are more into character chops and comedy. What we have is a very unfocused movie with such an uninteresting villain that I felt like they just dragged and dropped him from a Mortal Kombat cutscene. Whatever they were trying to establish with Cyborg's struggle as a half-man half-machine falls way flat, so does Wonder Woman's attempt at being an anchor for the morality of the team. Batman just mopes around and Flash just goofs around. Jason Momoa was a standout, but that's the point - not enough screen time is devoted to any of these characters for us to like them. There are no character arcs. <br/><br/>There are certainly some good set pieces in the movie - the Amazon fight was good, so was the final fight scene, although it was very obvious they color-corrected much of it to look at least visible to the naked eye and for that I am thankful to Mr. Whedon. The stand-out scene for me was when Superman wakes up - Superman's fight with the team (although contrived in response to the success of Civil War) was interesting and I perked up for a moment, only to be undercut by Steppenwolf going ""YOINK! Stole your BOX"" and Superman returning to Smallville for the highly predictable recuperation scene with a sub-par Lois Lane performance and his mother (MARTHA!). Honestly, they missed a lot of great potential conflict with that subplot. <br/><br/>All-in-all, I am surprised by how much everybody seems to be liking movie. I can only attribute that to the die-hard DC fanboyism and the vocal immature majority of the internet. I just want to know what the comic book fans think of this movie. So many great stories involving the Justice League (can someone please show Chris Terrio and his WB overlords the Timmverse JLA series?) This movie falls flat on its face into sub-par cheese cartoonish territory with the rushed team-up plot line and no focus of character chemistry. This is exactly what you would expect from a Zack Snyder helmed WB-DC product which Joss Whedon was hired cleaned up. Kudos to Joss Whedon for adding/modifying scenes that made the movie at least slightly watchable, but I would have loved to have seen a Justice League movie totally helmed by Joss Whedon, or even one which truly represented Zack Snyder's vision (however bad it may be). A 50-50 product just made it schlock-central, a betrayal to all involved in the creative process and insulting to the viewers."

","I grew up with DC and JLA (and Superfriends). Gal Gadot is perfect and WB got Wonder Woman 'right'. But she can't save this film. it's just dull. If you are going to spend your money, go spend it on Thor Ragnarok - it's visually more impressive and has an actual plot that you can invest yourself in; Justice League's plot doesn't have any hooks to latch onto, and while we love the characters, and the cast has finally been well thought out, with the exception of Wonder Woman the costumes are still a failure and the story is all over the map making little sense and not allowing for any emotional investment in any character other than Superman - whose roll has nothing to do with the threat at hand or the history of it.

"family-88144","8","344","707","15 November 2017"," The fans love the film critics hate it.
","Its the same old story when it come to films. Critics demolish a film and people who are interested to watch it don't and end up watching it illegally then realizing it was amazing. I experienced this when great reviews came out for guardians of the galaxy 2, I went to watch it and hated it. I enjoyed this film personally but don't take my word for it go watch it for your self. The movie brings together what we all hoped for, a team. its fun, bright and energetic with a balance of seriousness.<br/><br/>A piece of advice don't go into this movie expecting to watch a movie on the level of the dark knight. In my opinion the only film to ever get close to that was the dark knight rises. As for the DC cinematic universe expect an array of bright movies the next possible dark movie you'll get is probably THE BATMAN."

","Wooooow! This movie was everything that I could hoped for in a team of  superheroes movie. It was fun, intense, exciting, full of action and  humor at the same time. And overall one heck of a very entertaining  superhero movie. I had lots of fun watching this movie from beginning  till end. The start of the movie was already making us intrigued, then  slowly the revealing of other superheroes were totally cool. It was  very enjoyable to see one by one introduced to us.  When Wonder Woman was shown again, my wife was very ecstatic and she  immediately was reminded why she loved that movie so much. Then when we  were shown The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg's abilities when they teamed  up to fight Steppenwolf, it was amazing. But what was very enjoyable  was actually the performance of Ezra Miller as the Flash, who was  characterized as very fun, young superhero. He was able to make me less  upset for taking over the role which I thought should have gone to  Grant Gustin who portrayed as the Flash in the TV series. Lots of the  funny moments involved him. Jason Momoa I think suit the role of  Aquaman (and I cannot wait to see his solo movie in 2018). While Cyborg  was the one character that felt not too much explored (perhaps only my  feeling), although he did have brief moment of fun when relating with  Barry Allen.  The action sequences here were absolutely thrilling, intense and  greatly done. There were so many of them that I loss count (not that I  was really counting anyway). The solo fights of the superheroes, their  brief internal fights and of course the climax scene which was totally  awesome but still showed a bit of surprisingly funny moment (be sure  not to miss that part). There were not a lot of dramatic moment here  but as a movie of superhero team, this one certainly did not  disappoint. My wife and I who are fans of comic superheroes, were  really satisfied and absolutely thrilled with the whole movie. We even  think of possibly watching the movie once again.  The special effects and the sound effects were awesome! I am confident  that you would get an even better experience watching it in a good  quality theaters, especially ones with Dolby Atmos or in IMAX as it was  shown in the end credit scene that the movie was specially formatted  for IMAX. Talking about the end credit scene, there was 1 fun scene in  the middle and another important scene at the very end which would give  us excitement of the future movie of DC Extended Universe.   I know that some people still could not find the good in the movie,  perhaps due to the bias/low expectation, but I totally feel that it  would be a shame if this movie was not enjoyed as a fun superhero  movie. I honestly hope it would make most people satisfied. I am really  recommending this to be seen as soon as you can, so you could discuss  the movie with your friends or families."

Especially when they ruined Thor's characters. It makes me upset.<br/><br/>But for this Justice League, I was amazed! The jokes are on point, they played the characters so well and natural, and so realistic for today's society! And the punch-up-lines of the jokes was on point, so cool, without ruining any characters just like the Comic Books! But idk why the Batman feels so dark this time...<br/><br/>Yeah, I'm the sad marvel fans especially for the Ragnarok movies.

","Like many other I have waited eagerly to see the movie but I have highly disappointed On par with BvS.I was so excited to see Batman,aquaman,The flash, Cyborg and my sweet prince Diana (wonder woman) all together under one umbrella. All those gadgets of batman, Raw power of cyborg and aquaman are all seemed really bland and uninteresting to me.I am supposed to like this movie more than avengers cause this has 6 heros avengers had 4 and we barely knew any avenger before the movie.But we know all these characters before the JL movie.<br/><br/>It has been seen in the past that these movies concentrate so much in actions and special effect that they put little concentration on the plot.And unfortunately this movie focused way more on action instead of plot.It has a mediocre plot with a forgettable villain and his typical large team of warriors. The story wasn't enough to give the movie a perfect concrete base.<br/><br/>They pretty much showed us almost all action scenes on trailers.Well it is normal since they released 4 trailers and tons of TV spots<br/><br/>The bonding of characters wasn't seem to be deep enough or sincere.Well it is normal cause it was like cyborg,flash,aquaman were all waiting and ready for batman,w.woman to find them and ask help.<br/><br/>I had 0 excitement for this movie when the theater gave a break.This movie seemed as somewhat ""x men apocalypse vol 2""<br/><br/>The cyborg's cgi is almost like those shitty cgi s from dc/cw shows.<br/><br/>Sorry DC.I cannot let you fool me again.I don't think I can pay to watch your movies for the next 3-4 years."

"hawkerjacob","4","81","154","30 November 2017"," Another flop in an already dead series
","Zack Snyder's ""Justice League"" is nothing more than another poorly made movie in a franchise that's practically been dead since its second film. While not as horrible, ""Justice League"" still is not good. The most redeeming factor of the film is some of its characters, but that isn't enough to pull this series out of the hole its in. On the plus side, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman still shines, even after her wonderfully made standalone film, and may be the best character in the film. Jason Mamoa's Aquaman is a lot of fun, with great humor to go alongside him. Ray Fisher's Cyborg is also an interesting and fun character, being equally as good as Momoa, maybe even slightly better. Unfortunately, Ezra Miller's Flash does not blend with the darkness of every other character, some saying that is the point, but he is almost too far gone to blend in any way. Then, Affleck's Batman is a dry, dull, ill-humored, useless character, and Henry Cavill still broods too much to be fun, and is a somewhat useless addition. The villain of the film is nonthreatening, boring, and plot less, and could be the worst part of the entire film, next to the clichÃ© and boring plot that has been seen in every Avenger's movie to this day, and believe me, I hate having to make that comparison. ""Justice League is moderately fun, but still can't redeem this helpless series."
"Kevo7","9","167","334","13 November 2017"," Overall fun
","I really enjoyed this movie although there are a few things that definitely stood out that holds JL back from being well-rounded.<br/><br/>1. Pacing/Transitions. One thing I enjoyed about WW was the fact that it flowed a lot better in my opinion compared to BvS (theatrical cut). The beginning of JL was choppy and from what I understand they had to make the movie less than 2 hours via the WB CEO. You definitely see that in the pacing which the movie honestly needed about 15-20 more minutes to smooth things out. <br/><br/>2. Villain. Steppenwolf overall was a pretty good villain but could have been more. One thing that disappoints me about any superhero movie are villains that aren't fully utilized to their potential. <br/><br/>Those are the two things that stood out to me the most about JL that left me wanting more of a better product.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the character development is really good. I enjoyed Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman. Ezra Miller is a great Barry Allen. Ray Fisher & Jason Mamoa fit their characters really well. WW, Batman, and Superman were all great but it was nice to see JL uplift the new superheroes & pave their way for their future solo movies, etc.<br/><br/>The movie was really fun, jokes were there and most of them were well timed. The overall tone was light-hearted than BvS, but I personally liked BvS being a darker tone.<br/><br/>There are two end credit scenes! Be sure to stay!!! I believe the way that JL ended it opens up a realm of possibilities for DC. I am excited about the future and what DC does with their characters. I know they're 5 movies in right now but they're learning from their mistakes for the most part. This franchise has a bright future as long as they continue to not make the same common mistakes that plagued a lot of their other movies.<br/><br/>8.5/10."
"greytree","1","137","271","14 November 2017"," Awful! CGI Mess! It is 2 hours of utter boredom!
","Wow where to start. First off HUGE disappointment of a movie. Why was this even made is what I was asking myself when it finally finished... There is no substance with terrible directing and utterly boring action sequences that have no sense of purpose or lead to anything meaningful. It is a worse version of BvS and by a long shot too. Imagine BvS with another 5 more heroes. Yeah you get my drift... I'll give it a generous 2 because Wonder Woman movie was top notch and she happened to be in this."
"JoeYabuki","8","275","565","15 November 2017"," It is a very funny movie with good characters that we love.
","Unlike BvS, in this all the characters have their character and  personality defined.The Flash is the nicest of all, he is the comic  relief all the time. Aquaman is like a rocker, a rebel without a cause  who is enjoying ""la vida loca"" and I want to see him in his solo movie.  Cyborg is the most bitter, as it is a marginalized human-machine- alien  mix. Batman and Wonder Woman have a good chemistry, and WW is still  amazing. This is the Superman that I wanted to see in the cinema.  The aspect of the parademons is incredible, they are like a kind of  hybrid between vampires and insects and the combats with the  protagonists are spectacular. Steppenwolf is horrible, very soft,  lacked rudeness and character, in addition the CGI is bad, it seems a  badly made video game.  The CGI in Themyscira for example is terrible, but the action sequence  is impressive. The reshoots are noticeable, like the CGI to remove the  mustache to Henry Cavill.  The dialogues of the film are not very good. The story is simple and is  set for the common viewer to understand, simply ""the bad guy wants 3  mother boxes to take down the world.""  The film fix some holes in BvS. The colors of the film are really high,  they are alive and with intensity, totally different from BvS because  of what the darkness was criticized.  The film is cut, the priority of WB is obvious, and the scissors  between the action scenes is visible to the naked eye, in addition many  of the scenes of the trailers are not here.  The action is good but in the previous films it is better. OST of  #DannyElfman is forgettable, you just hear the theme of classic  superman of 1978 and Batman of 1989 (And at the beginning when it comes  in WW you hear Hans Zimmer's). The previous films were action dramas  and the change of tone of this film is action adventure and comedy  (they started the change with WW) and take the right path. It is not an  epic film but in spite of all the failures I have HOPE in this  universe. I liked it very much.  PS: the two post-credits scenes are very good."

First is Aquaman. Because of his role is somehow important in this movie, he's got a lot of background story. Can't explain more because there is a spoiler on it. Next is Cyborg. He has similar portion with the man who uses fork to fight. However, he has a significant role for the movie. Last is Barry Allen. The movie brings premise to Flash movie in the next year. Overall, it is great.<br/><br/>Move to the plot. Personally, I do find it fast-paced :( Maybe it is true that Zack Snyder is lack on delivering the story. Up until now, it bothers me why Warner Bros used this kind of plot to bring the league. Nevertheless, I was delightful to see the action scenes. The first last battle makes me shivers.<br/><br/>Conclusion's time! Justice League is a nice-packed of several action scenes movie. I would say that this movie is a jumping stone for their next crossover because of its lack essence of the story. For fanboys, there are lot of hints that you can find in the movie. It pleases your thirst, I mean hunger, for comic book references. The score is 8 of 10. (If it is seen by the action, I would definitely give it 9)' <br/><br/>P.S : There are two post end credit scenes. To be honest, the last credit scene almost make me lost my mind on DC Cinematic Universe. Totally love it."

","Word of mouth will hurt this thing because it's mangled and dumb with no heart at all. Quite frankly, too dumb to enjoy. I know fanboys everywhere are circling the wagons to praise this movie but that in and of itself proves what I'm saying. Fanboys wanted to like it and apparently will look past all of its flaws.<br/><br/>Everyone else is saying or will soon be saying that JL is a dumb popcorn flick at best but really nothing special and just as bad as BvS. How can a film follow something that bad but still give anyone high expectations? Yet, thanks to good trailers, that's exactly what happened.<br/><br/>Well, the actual movie is going to lead to general disappointment especially if you're not already a fan. Campy, cheesy fluff pretending to be dark and serious usually fizzles out fast. Yet, as MOS proved this may be an indestructible franchise that won't die no matter how bad the stuff they churn out. No spoilers but trust me, the ending won't leave a good taste at all.<br/><br/>Just think, some people thought they were disappointed by MoS and BvS. If that's the case, then wait until they get a load of this thing. They added Flash,Cyborg but dragged that cool characters down to this level."

The plot didn't know where it was going.Already hated the flash character.He was annoying just like h.Quinn in s.squad.This flash character tried way too hard to be funny and ended up being the cheesiest,cringiest character on the movie You can see that Zack tried hard very hard to fit everything nicely into the movie, but over stuffing was bound to happen.

Halfway through the movie I genuinely wondered how I got here and why the movie is halfway done when it feels like it's been 5 minutes of ""story"".<br/><br/>I truthfully cannot understand how people can be rating this 9 and 10 stars. WB do not make good DC movies. I understand it's frustrating but pretending it's a good movie is hurting your chances of ever actually making them good in the future.

After that I saw it's first trailer before Snyder's exit, I felt how awesome it would be if the original version released. One element whedon forgot to add which was one of the reasons for the success of avengers is chemistry between the actors. Avengers had memorable chemistry of tony-cap, tony-banner, thor-hulk, nat-cap, nat-banner and nat-clint. But here there is no chemistry between the leads at all. Batman, aquaman and cyborg were wasted.
Many hate Snyder's style but the fact is he does it with ðŸ’“. He had a clear vision about dceu with the 5 films (mos,bvs and JL trilogy) he had in mind. But after his exit the whole dceu is in mess. First, wb messed with bvs and now with JL. Please release the Snyder cut in hbo max."

"lasttimeisaw","6","14","22","19 November 2017"," not an enterprising innovator but a formulaic stepping stone
","Riding on the coattail of WONDER WOMAN's stirring triumph, Zac Snyder's JUSTICE LEAGUE is emulating DC's THE AVENGERS (2012), only 5-year has become such an oceanic gap in our time of superhero surpluses, which means financial turnover would be a letdown in spite of its immense appeal. <br/><br/>The elephant-in-the-room and main selling point is the resurrection of Superman (Cavill), an open secret the film intractably refuses to divulge in its numerous trailers and posters, which comes about in the mid-point and temporarily instigates a mini-internecine scuffle, just to show who is the boss, before getting lovey-dovey and melancholic with Lois Lane (Adams), who is too poised to give away even a smidgen of incredulity (which says a lot about the comic book culture itself). <br/><br/>As the inauguratory piece, JUSTICE LEAGUE's chief task is to assemble the cohort, thus the premise is set up by the resurgence of Steppenwolf (CGI-generated and voiced by Hinds), to reign the universe in darkness, the film's strongest visual input is surprisingly in the the first half, when Steppenwolf tentatively assaults the empyrean Themyscira (Amazons' homeland) and underwater Atlantis to snatch the almighty ""mother boxes"", and the fleeting flashback of how Steppenwolf is subdued for the first time, it has an epic whiff of panache and otherness, which diminishes when the war relocates on human's turf (a remote Russian village is circumspectly chosen for the climax after learning the lesson from the aftermath of laying waste to a highly-populated metropolis), with a bathetic revelation that perhaps, Steppenwolf's power is vastly overestimated, because he is categorically no rival of Superman, the quintet might just as well finish him off sans the film's obvious deus ex-machina. It is expected to pull punches in the league's first official sortie, but by enervating the villain who is introduced as an omnipotent monster in the beginning is a lame move (THOR: RAGNAROK on the contrary, fabricates a more plausible finale). <br/><br/>For all the quibbles, there are several plus points too, firstly, it is a sage move to accentuate Batman's mortality, which begins to tell when fighting side by side with those superpower endowed, and he is considerably relegated to combat with the minions called Parademons in the showdown, a cross to bear for a mortal, and let's hope Bruce Wayne will take the hint and step down from the front-line in the next chapter, not because an elderly Alfred (Irons) does need a replacement to stay in front of all the consoles and screens, but also due to the fact that Diane Prince (Gadot) is ready to take the rein as a true leader for all mankind, it is time, right? Secondly, in a less solemn note, Ezra Miller's Flash jovially assumes the role as the comic purveyor because humor is what is wanting in DC's previous critically-panned tent-poles, because the delicate balance between levity and gravity is always the sticking point which does make a difference in audience's reception and the film's own worth. <br/><br/>All in all, JUSTICE LEAGUE is not an enterprising innovator but a formulaic stepping stone to tantalize us that the next offering will be more toothsome, more grand and more arousing, but patience is dangerously wearing thin and interest will dry out someday, speaking for the reviewer himself, that day is beckoning."
"namob-43673","1","127","260","14 November 2017"," A bad movie, but almost okayish Superhero movie
","I had low expectations for this movie. The trailers did not do it for me, and seeing DC/WB track record I was very hesitant and worried. Seeing the movie last night my low expectations and worry came true. I really wanted to love this movie, but just as with BvS I got out of the theater feeling I had wasted my money and lost 2hrs of my life. This is better than BvS, but then again: what isn't? <br/><br/>Not sure where to put this movie. It is, at times, sort of messy ""fun"" as Suicide squad was, and it is not as dumb as BvS. JL tries to follow the Marvel formula a bit, throwing in a few one liners and the movie have a few fun moments, and although those funnies mostly work they also feel too forced in there. <br/><br/>Personally I still think Man of Steel is the best movie from DC so far, too bad they messed up the start and ending of that movie, otherwise MoS would have been a great movie. Personally I did not like WW, although it had its moments. <br/><br/>So where does this belong? <br/><br/>Well, let us start with the negative: <br/><br/>The CGi is actually really bad, just as bad as in Wonder Woman, or even worse. I see better CGi on TV nowadays, and I am not sure why DC and WB cannot do it better. Where did the money go? Affleck's salary? TVs Smallville had better effects, or look at Agents of Shield of today; they do great things with a fraction of the budget. <br/><br/>The story is way too rushed. That apparent WB corporate directive of keeping the movie shorter then 2h seem to have done a lot of damage. Not that 30min more would make that big of a difference, but I will assume that a director's cut will be slightly better. This is especially sad for me since in the comics DC usually have great very well written stories. Here, not so much <br/><br/>Probably due to being too rushed the movie has a pace issue. Either it moves too slow, or too fast. When you see the movie you'll probably understand what I mean. <br/><br/>Cyborg does not work. Partly it is the bad CGi, but the actor is not very good in this role either. <br/><br/>The villain does not work. Sure if you've read the comics you do, sort of, have an idea and know a bit of backstory, but in the movie none of that comes out – we are not clearly told who he is (except for some ""historical"" exposition), we do not know what motivates him, why he is there. The little we do get to know is not enough for the general movie goer. The Villain is also very, very generic. Probably the most generic villain we've seen in any superhero movie. He shows up, with bad CGi, they fight for a bit, and well, you can guess the rest. One of the worst villains I've seen in a movie like this. <br/><br/>A lot of critics have praised The Flash in this movie, personally I do not really see it. Sure he has a few fun moments, but it feels a bit forced and too much ""let's copy Marvel"" funnies about it. <br/><br/>There are a few major plot holes, and a few convoluted moments that ruins the experience and as a critic those moments are very hard to avoid. You can see them as plot devices (at best), OR: only forced upon badly written moments if you want to be more direct. I will update this part with detailed spoilers once I've seen the movie again. <br/><br/>Positive: It is decently entertaining, at times... and it is not BvS bad. Wonder woman is pretty good in this movie, even better then in her own movie I would say, and the side-characters work very well. Aquaman is good. The acting okay and wellthat is pretty much it. <br/><br/>Summery: Nothing fantastic nor great, JL is not a good movie. As a superhero movie this is okayish entertainment and Justice League is better than crap like Fan4stic or the horrible BvS, but is that really the comparison you want to make with a JL movie? As a Superhero movie I would give this a 3, but as a movie this is really bad and about a 1, so I ended up giving this a 2 in total. Not worth the ticket price unless you are very young. Or: if you do not mind seeing dumb story-lines and you just came to see some bad CGi action, then this may work.... For the normal movie-goer and for us looking for quality, this is not for us. <br/><br/>If this had come out 20y ago, it would have been pretty great, nowadays we expect more, want more, deserve more, and with this talent and all the money spent they should have produced a lot better movie. <br/><br/>A bad movie, but almost okayish Superhero movie.<br/><br/>Edit: Saw it again yesterday (pirated - do not watch this at the cinema!! Do not waste your money!!) and I need to lower my score. Horrible movie and seeing it again, more focused, I see so much crap I do not know what to do. Worst movie of 2017, and that is saying something."

","Let me start off by saying -- I'm a huge DC fan and a movie buff. I fully appreciate the intricacies involved in bringing something this huge to the screen and I realize there are weaknesses in every movie. That being said <br/><br/>It's as if the writers have attempted to cram the entire DC universe into two hours with little consideration for what that does to the plot or the viewer's brain as they try to comprehend this hot mess. On top of that, The villain is the most generic brand of threat-to-the-planet bad guy imaginable and it takes way more energy than I have to take him seriously enough to even care.<br/><br/>But that's's okay right? When the writing is bad we can always keep the audience entertained by blowing things up, you know, like in Superman - Man of Steel (in fact, just like in Superman - Man of Steel) where Superman and General Zod knock down all the skyscrapers in Metropolis. Over and over. Pointlessly. For seemingly the last hour of the movie. <br/><br/>But we'll need some really exceptional CGI to make that band-aid hold. Which leads to  who releases a movie in 2017 with original Star Wars era CG? I And even that might have worked had they not overreached by so much. And the music? Not so important to the overall movie, but really? <br/><br/>What did they do with that massive budget? Maybe they should have paid the actors and actresses a little less and a bit more for the writers, composers and the CGI<br/><br/>Short on plot, same old tired action scenes but now with antique CGI, uneven acting (not that there's really much room in this movie for anything resembling acting — ridiculous posing at best) and it only took $300,000,000 to lay another DC egg. How does the same company that is capable of the Dark Knight and Wonder Woman come up with this ... crap?<br/><br/>Should come with a warning -- Move along, there's nothing to see here (beyond what you've already seen for free on the trailer)."

","I really wanted to like it. I hoped the negativity would be due to too much fighting, CGI, or something of the sort. <br/><br/>No, the movie is just bad, and worst of all has no soul, no feeling, and the characters just seem like a bunch of stern faces. <br/><br/>At the end, for someone who loves DC characters and really wanted to like some part of this movie - I watched the whole thing without a genuine smile (nor laugh). There's no personality in any of the characters, just one heartless scene followed by another (I'm not criticizing the actors, I think they did a fine job with this piss poor writing, direction, whatever). The only topic of discussion was the bad guy, the ""team up"" felt forced and dull. <br/><br/>Superman's return was handled atrociously. Even a simple dues ex machina of him randomly popping out of his grave when the movie needed him most would've been better writing. But no, let's use ""science"" (in the bad type of star trek technobable) to bring him back, just so you can have another scene of hero-on-hero action. I mean worked wonders for BvS, what could go wrong if we do it again, right? Whatever executive forced this supposedly good for marketing nonsense should be fired and sent to Siberia.<br/><br/>I still think Afflec is not the best for the role, but he still did a better than expected job. Whoever wrote Batman's scenes probably got him confused with Rip Hunter, though. Aside of telling a character or two what they didn't want to hear (which IS Batman-like), no other part of his character came even close. <br/><br/>Barry... so what, now the Flash is ANTI-social? Are you KIDDING ME? What's next, Batman's stand-up comedy hour, Superman's ""why you should always run from a bully"" anti-motivational speech? Has anyone in charge of this movie ever read or seen a proper DC movie/film/series?<br/><br/>The only pleasant surprise was that Aquaman, for once, was not portrayed in such a light as to be the orange sidekick no ones cares for. His lasso scene was probably the best part of the movie (and it wasn't that great). <br/><br/>I recently re-watched Batman Begins for the nth time. I also re-watched the first episode of the 2001 Justice League animated series not too long ago (you know, when they come together for the first time... hm sounds familiar). How in the world can you go from those, to this pile of nothing, while spending so much more budget!? Where did the budget even go, 90% of this was CGI? <br/><br/>Pure garbage. As much as I hate to say it, I'd skip it if I could."
"Ska4Live","6","58","113","16 November 2017"," Justice Comedy central
","First of all, forget the dark tone of MoS and BvS, new Zack Snyder movie Justice League it is a comedy! And I think this could be one of problems of this movie. SO here is 3 main problems. PLS beware of spoilers below!!<br/><br/>Lets start with obvious problem which we saw in BvS and Suicide Squad – montage and editing. Warner seems like didn't learn they bad lesson at all. JL is a great example of terrible editing. All 2 Hours of movie you see different scenes hard cut one-by-one . Such switching between locations, Time and characters, may look like you was napping for few minutes and then suddenly wake up in the middle of some action scene. Time on screen for such characters like: Comm. Gordon, Mera, Martha Kent, Alfred - overall takes 5-6 minutes of screen time. Together! Some scenes which you was able to see and enjoy in Trailers are cutted. Well, probably fifth part of all scenes in all trailers - are NOT in the movie! SO, editing I think is the main and the biggest minus. <br/><br/>Second, it the tone and genre. By looking on colors you see that studio already leave gray tones like were in first movies, now we see more warm colors like it was in WW Themiscira world. That definitely positive moment. But changing genre by 180 degrees, from dark drama to colorful comedy, even for good purposes, it is completely stupid decision by Warner and DC. Some of action\fight scenes looks completely not dynamic. They are boring and you don't empathize to protagonist. Remember Bat fight in warehouse in BvS? You won't see this in again. Instead of this, we saw in opening scene, battle choreography like in Batman 1989, Michael Keaton level. I know that Danny Elfman was happy to bring 1989 Bat-theme to this movie, but create movie in 2017 and makes it style like it was from earlier 90-s, that is damn shame. <br/><br/>Third, characters and their chemistry. Main Antagonist. Forget about Steppenwolf from trailers and his lines ""no protectors here .bla bla bla this world will fall..bla bla bla"" and etc. and - Nope. Our guy spoke simple and annoying things so often that maybe this is main reason why JL need to stop him. The colors used for Stepenwolf - cold-gray pallet. Which is, I think, too insensibly for such character. Superman. Yes he is in the League. Yes he was returned from the dead. I will left details of this process. But the emotion that we saw on Clark face after his 'returning', and emotions after a day in hugs with Lois, changed his view on things. From brutal and cold Bizzaro to 'Your best friend neighbor Superman, from Kansas' only few hours in corn field with Lois and Mom, and you are ready for saving world and joking together with your new teammates.<br/><br/>Details, Mistakes, Mismatches all of this could by only 2 reason. On my opinion those were caused by: changing director + reshooting and hard cut. Just few quick examples. SPOILER below!! After Clark has been returned to his memory and mood, he flight to help his new friend. We saw him in in new suit where this suit come from? Who made it? We doesn't have answer. Another, very personal mistake. On first scenes somewhere close to abandoned nuclear plant, we saw old building with letters on the top – ОТЕЛ, - which translates as HOTEL – from Russian. In the scenes of final battle we see, another (or even the same building) with letters ГОТЕЛЬ – which also means HOTEL – but from Ukrainian. Yes maybe for many of you it is just small details, but believe me for Slavic people, in modern world, this is huge error. And it is based on disrespect from movie makers who just don't gives a sh*t on such things. I want to believe that this is Joss Whedon feature. He always put into his movies some empty civilian personages who are suffer during battles. And from Avengers time he didn't learn nothing about alphabets of other countries.<br/><br/>Positive moment(s). Chemistry of the Heroes. Relationships between Diana and Bruce, Victor and Barry,Arthur and all others members, it is great examples of how teams should look like. The Flash and Aquman are main positive moments and only because of them rating are higher than 5 stars. As a conclusion, my verdict 6.5\10. I really want to believe that we will see Ultimate version, and this will bring rating growth. But for now – I can stop expecting any positive moments from DC and Warner. They must to sit down, calm down, clear their minds and heard and find a final decision, what are they want to see more. Only money from fiction movies or movies with ideas and souls."

"allenquanobi","2","46","88","16 November 2017"," This is not the justice league
","TL;DR: The movie is a mess: Safe but unoriginal, thin and confusing plot. Zero character development, leading to disappointing performances. Ridiculously bad CGI. Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg, and Superman. The most iconic super heroes in comic book and pop culture history. Should be easy to make a cool and compelling movie about them right? Eh, maybe not. Lets start with the Pros: - Ezra Miller as the Flash is entertaining at points. His comic relief at points felt forced, but some of the jokes landed. - Comic Book references; for a DC comics fan, there are cool references throughout the movie that were cool to connect to the comics and made me smile a little bit. Moving on to the neutral points: - The plot was extremely safe; however, it is also ridiculously rushed. One could say this is expected because 3 of the main characters (Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman) are appearing for the first time. The plot also is ridiculously unoriginal: Aliens are looking for artifacts. Once they find artifacts, the world will be destroyed. Team must assemble and stop them before it's too late. One could argue that this is expected too; look at the Avengers, they did that also. But the thing that the Avengers did that DC fails tremendously at is setting up each character with a backstory so the audience can feel and care about each character's motivations (except Hawkeye). The only character that is given a little bit of an emotional backstory here is the Flash, and if you have watched the TV series you know what backstory I'm talking about. In summary, the plot was incredibly unoriginal, rushed, and predictable to the very end. - Ben Affleck as Batman: Affleck fails to impress as he did in Batman v Superman; however it isn't his fault. He does the best with what he is given here, even delivering some funny one-liners. However, if anyone know Batman at all, the character written in this story is a complete 180 from both Batman v Superman and the Batman of the comics. Gone is the dark from the Dark Knight, replaced by a Batman so light, there were flashes of the post Keaton, pre Bale Batman portrayals. The fact that Danny Elfman's score also brought these memories back did not help. - Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman: Gadot suffers from the same problem as Affleck: her character is written extremely poorly. Similar to Captain America, she is a warrior from a time long gone, a time that was simpler and more heroic. Therefore, Wonder Woman should be going through the same effects that Captain America did in the Avengers: bashing with other characters who don't exemplify heroism while portraying the ideal heroic nature that she was raised with. However, her character gets demoted to sexy heroine; every shot that introduces her starts from her behind and ends at here chest area. Gadot does the best with what she's given though, and is just fine in her role as co-leader to the squad. - Danny Elfman's score: Heroic at best and fine at worst, this score is no Zimmer's Man of Steel or Wonder Woman themes. Every track here is nearly forgettable, only saved by Elfman's callbacks to his familiar Batman theme, original Superman theme, and the Wonder Woman theme. Lastly the negatives: - CGI: With a rumored 300 million dollar budget, one can only wonder how in the world can a studio mess up something that is more than 90% of the movie? Starting with the very first scene which is (spoiler) a video recording of Superman. As most know, Cavill was unwilling to shave his mustache because he was filming MI6 at the same time, so the studio had to digitally remove it. The end result is something that looked like Marlon Brando in the Godfather. Immediately bringing laughs, this scene is just a precedent for the rest of the film's horrific CGI. The villain looks like a college student digitally created him for an extra credit project, with clunky movement and not fitting in with the background at all. Cyborg is an unfortunate casualty of this as well because for the whole movie his CGI just distracts from Fisher's performance and dialogue (more on that later). Nearly every shot during battle scenes and on Themyscira look like they were animated for a commercial. - Momoa and Fisher as Aquaman and Cyborg: Similar to Batman and Wonder Woman, it looks like these characters were written with little to zero personality. However, unlike Gadot and Affleck, Momoa and Fisher are barely there, delivering their lines like they are reading them for the first time. Their characters just feel like ex machinas at points. Momoa tries a little to just be himself, which can be seen as a good thing, but doesn't fit the tone of the movie at all. - Jumping around from location to location: When Star Wars Rogue One came out, people complained that the first half hour was dizzying due to the jumps from planet to planet. In this movie, it's not planet to planet, but from city to plane to city to island to ocean to city to flashback, without any warning or location status to even prepare the audience of the scene. - Editing/Reshoots: Building on the last point, the movie itself feels off. One can definitely tell the different tones from Snyder and Whedon immediately. (Spoiler) For example, Aquaman is introduced twice, and it is extremely obvious which one was the reshoot compared to Snyder's version. It's like there were two versions of the movie, and they couldn't decide which version to release so they just grabbed and mixed scenes from both versions. The final battle as well is immediately guilty of this. - Handling of Superman: Superman was gonna come back, only a child would be surprised by this. However, this movie retcons Batman v Superman in a way that makes no sense."

","Woah, just watched the movie today and I can say that I am relieved. Going into the movie I was very nervous, but now that i have watched the movie, I can say its worth the watch.<br/><br/>Due to the two hour time limit imposed by Warner Bros., the movie definitely seems quite rushed. Because of that, the introduction to the characters seems a little off. Since, I already knew how these characters became who they are, I could make sense of what was going. But for casual movie watchers, its not going to be that great but definitely a entertainment flick for sure.<br/><br/>The great side of the movie was the characters and the chemistry between them. Watching them on the big screen is a dream come true. I thought Ezra Miller as Flash was awesome and very funny. I can say the same about the other characters: Aquaman was bad-ass although he had less screen-time, Cyborg was definitely cool and Wonder Woman is as always charming. The other best parts of the movie would be Superman. I would say Superman stole the show. The CGI mustache wasn't that noticeable. But overall he did great. I can say the same about Batfleck. Ben Affleck as Batman is awesome.<br/><br/>Now the bad parts of the movie. The main issue was with the villain. Steppenwolf didn't seem so strong. Whenever he was out of the screen, I didn't really care about him. Also rushing is also an issue here because of the two hour limit. The CGI could be even better, but it was pleasing.<br/><br/>As a comic book fan, to see the references made in the movie was totally great. And there are two end-credit scenes. You definitely don't want two miss them. I had a great time watching the movie. And I am very hopeful for the upcoming DC movies."

","This was completely ""meh"" in most every way possible. Not offensively bad like Batman V Superman, but certainly not good either. Everything came across as shallow and the CGI bad guy is the absolute worst. Why on earth did they need to go all CGI and not use an actor? <br/><br/>I do totally agree with studio execs that forced them to keep the run time under two hours. Since everyone NOT Wonder Woman in this cinematic universe is terribly one dimensional, adding thirty minutes or more of mindless prattle would have been a terrible idea. Basically, there is no developing characters this shallow to start with... might as well go all video game cut scene action. As for Wonder Woman, THAT is the true ace the WB has going for them. Not the character so much as the actress they stumbled upon to play her. Talk about finding absolute gold. Gal Gadot hypnotizes and captivates on screen no matter what she is doing. Add action to her natural beauty and charm and you literally can't get enough of her in to the story. I'm sure they realize that the focus should be on her from here forward. <br/><br/>Of the new characters, only Cyborg has any hint of depth at all. Both Flash and Aquaman are cardboard wastes so far. So, the DCEU is truly stuck in the shallow end of the pool but maybe Wonder Woman can single-handedly tow the universe to deeper and more interesting waters.<br/><br/>Best overall quote I've read: ""Justice League was the cinematic equivalent of watching a classmate give a presentation they totally forgot about"""

","Note: The review is free of spoilers till the ""--SPOILERS AHEAD--"" ahead line.<br/><br/>I liked Justice League.<br/><br/>However, I was disappointed with the way it all went. I was expecting more from DC. No doubt it's fun, sometimes I felt like they're trying to imitate Marvel. The unexpected punchlines are usually seen in Marvel movies, they brought it to Justice League too. No doubt the jokes were funny. But the narration is what disappointed me the most. Even after BvS, Wonder Woman and now Justice League (biggest DC instalment), I'm unable to see where DC is headed.<br/><br/>The narration is very confusing. JL also fails in giving a direction where DC wants to head. The movie has problems with pacing as well. Sometimes its too rushed and fast-paced and sometimes it just goes total Slo-mo. It seems like Zack and Joss weren't on it at point. I think the movie would have just gone fine with Joss Whedon. Also, the CGI isn't up to the mark either. No, it's not total crap like Green Lantern, but isn't great either.<br/><br/>Coming on to characters-- Flash, rather than being young-y, spirited and wise like the one in the TV series, feels irritating like Lex Luther of BvS. In fact, you'll feel like it's Robin under the mask. Cyborg and Aquaman do fine, but the lifesaver of this movie is Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman and Batman (Ben Afleck), Superman is great too, but the contrast of light (Superman) and dark (Batman) is still missing. The most ironic thing about this movie is that at the end, you'll feel like some characters weren't even required for it all to happen. Superman, however, is the heart of the movie and has a much bigger role than you might have expected.<br/><br/>The score is average, I personally believe that the scores in BvS and Wonder Woman were both great, Justice League's isn't as par with the other ones. You'll hear the old Batman and Superman themes once again, except that they're pretty generic. Compare this to the remastered edition of Spiderman theme song we heard in Spiderman Homecoming and it, unfortunately, fails to keep up here as well. Won't bother much if you choose to ignore the score tho.<br/><br/>And Steppenwolf (I know it sounds funny, right?). Steppenwolf is your typical villain. He comes, fights, and loses. That's it. Unlike Hela, who we recently saw in Thor: Ragnarok, Steppenwolf isn't interconnected with the heroes, he carries no concrete vision, as I mentioned already, he comes and goes. Steppenwolf fight scenes had really, really bad CGI, especially above the neck.<br/><br/>-- SPOILERS AHEAD --<br/><br/>So the movie starts with the same DC logo we saw in Wonder Woman (in case you care about that). You'll see some kids who are questioning Superman about the 'S' tag, there's a dramatic flashback of Cyborg, Barry has a job and Wonder Woman looks gorgeous.<br/><br/>You'll witness Green Lantern in a flashback scene fighting with Amazoners against Steppenwolf. Perhaps, that is the only Green Lantern scene (forgive me If there were others). Also, there is no recreation of the (in)famous warehouse scene.<br/><br/>The movie rushes and lags in between, as I mentioned in the primary review, the movie has a lot of issues with pace. <br/><br/>When they fight Steppenwolf, it's mainly Superman and Wonder Woman doing the top job, Batman's the mastermind -- he plans, Barry saves the civilians (no mention of Iris or most of the things we see in the TV Series). Superman is resurrected by Motherboxes.<br/><br/>The scene when Superman meets Martha is emotional. It's perhaps, the most moving scene in the whole movie.<br/><br/>Whilst the rest of the movie is predictable. There's Steppenwolf, the league unites and beat it. With Barry and Aquaman's humor.<br/><br/>-- END OF SPOILERS --<br/><br/>All in all, it's not what I expected. It's definitely not better than the animated Justice League of our childhoods. But won't disappoint like BvS or Suicide Squad did, but it's not as good as Wonder Woman either."
"blueclementinex","2","46","91","15 November 2017"," Not as bad as i thought it would be, but definitely not a great movie
","When i walked into this movie, i didn't expect anything but pure disaster. The trailers are not great. i think it's just getting my expectations lower and lower, and even if i ignore the trailers and all, this movie is not really set up for a good start. the Kickstarter of the movie, Batman V Superman: Dawn of justice, is very dull and boring as well as very confusing. but i must say this movie isn't as bad as what it should be- but that isn't saying much<br/><br/>It had many, MANY problems. one of them, as of course everyone expected it to be- the pacing. this film is very annoyingly confusing pacing. at times it felt super rushed then at times it became so slow. i didn't really felt surprised seeing this because literally, they're trying to make you care and felt sympathy about some characters that you didn't really know, except some characters that are already made appearances on the other movies ( which was not really developed well either) or if you read the comics (of course, not everybody read the comics). and the result is very dull. this is a very obvious problem because how greedy the studio is to make as much many as fast as possible. <br/><br/>the second problem i have for this movie is the characters and the quote-unquote humor. as i said before, I really felt nothing about the characters even after all the stuff they shoved right into your face and basically begging for the audience to care. and the worst part is that they are such blank slates with so-called humor. i don't have a problem with humor, but the humor in this movie is so forced it became cringe-worthy . i get how people complain how dark bvs is and i guess they want to try something new but don't do it in such a way that it ruins your characters. seriously it felt as if the characters are basically just waiting turns to say a 'tee-hee' punchline, even characters like BATMAN they ruined one of my most favorite character by how they portrayed batman so suddenly changed in this movie for the sake of 'humor' and lighter mood of the movie. it's very insulting how they turn batman from the dark, serious, brooding, even sometimes violent and doesn't care for anything but his only version of justice, and even try to justify the character once in a while by practically saying some lines that kind of remind us how he's supposed to be. now, the main characters and acting - Jason momoa as aquaman is entertaining to watch but underused. in the beginning, there are some cool scenes featuring him then he's just lost afterwards. ray fisher as cyborg is very boring and his conflict is boring. gal gadot as wonder woman is not as strong as what i expect her to be. she was pretty good in wonder woman but in this movie she's back to her bvs style of acting- boring and bland. Ben affleck as batman other than my earlier complaints is also very underused. he barely even have a decent scene, and it clearly shows how much Ben affleck doesn't want to be there . Henry cavill as superman is practically being as what he's always been in the previous movies but this time he cracks a joke or two and being some kind of last help plot device. Ezra miller as the flash is probably the most decent and the only one who is kind of funny. even though his only character is just being funny. <br/><br/>the characters literally doesn't have any chemistry. the scenes where they supposedly bond is so flat and have no emotion whatsoever. <br/><br/>fourth, the cgi and visuals, this movie has so many cgi that it doesn't felt real. and i guess people could say well it's a comic book movie of course it doesn't felt real. sure, but the cgi here is not only many and constant, it's also bad. even worst than wonder woman which baffles me since it probably the only thing they could have make better. <br/><br/>fifth, the plot. it has so many plot holes, unanswered question, conflict too quickly resolved, predictable moments, obvious plot devices, and so on. <br/><br/>i still have many issues with this film, but it's all that i have to say until now. i have some good things to say, though. i mean i appreciate how they reduce some unimportant boring things that they did with bvs. like lois lane and martha kent. they're decently put into the movie, as they supposed to be since they are just supporting characters to superman."

","So after BvsS, I really did not hope much from this movie but was surprised to see each and every scene and the action sequences which I think is the best of all superhero movies. Every single character is in place and has delivered their best performances. This movie is beyond expectations and has set a new record. I don't know why some people are not liking this movie, but for me, it's the best action movie of all time. The drawbacks of BvsS has been kept in mind and have been excellently overcome. Every character has been given attention to. Though the movie was fast that is not a bad thing after all. There is no dull moment in this movie. Thanks DC for making your fans proud!!!!"
"dvoon-missy-mcmuffin","4","25","46","15 November 2017"," Peppered with enough doses of fun
","As it stands, I am one of the very few whom appreciates Man of Steel for its somber tone. I am also one of the many that enjoyed Wonder Woman a lot. So the question is, where does Justice League rate amongst these? It comes in close. Not beyond. Not on par either.<br/><br/>Foremost, Justice League is a fun watch. The chemistry exuded by all the casts, especially Gal Gadot and Ezra Miller, are contagious. The shift of tone to somewhat ""lightheartedness"" is definitely something for me to get accustomed to. However, the humor is peppered with the right amounts. Sparingly used, at its right times; rather than it becoming quips to transition into the next scene. Serious moments remained serious, as it should be. Each hero have their own distinctive personality & trait; whereby, not everyone turns out to be the same wise cracking sarcastic narcissists. Which was great.<br/><br/>Secondly, the story that the League found themselves in...well it is coherent storytelling. Passable at best. It does feel epic only at certain points. Would I want it to be better? To be a masterpiece throughout? Definitely. But it does feel like a ride. From start to finish, even during its supposedly ""downtimes"", it moves along at a pretty fast pace.<br/><br/>Now my only hatred for this film. I had my fears when it was announced that Junkie XL was replaced. And that fear materialized into reality. Danny Elfman's score is so generic. Bland. I don't really hear a theme that I care for. OR is there even a theme to begin with? The so- called Batman, Superman theme of the past, were just meh. All I heard was generic music in the background, constantly gyrating annoyingly throughout the impressive visuals.<br/><br/>The one thing that the DC films had, which were emotionally charged, goosebump inducing scores, are now gone. Sigh..."
"glennvanrosmalen","8","32","61","22 January 2019"," Good enough.
","Just a good movie with all your favourite caracters. Great action, great fun. If you have to name the biggest flaw it would be that it came out a few years to soon. But I think Warner just got a bit anxious after the Avengers and were afraid to miss out on the hype and money of course. Some more standalone movies like a solo Batman and Flash before Justice league would have been a benefit. But all things considerd, good effort!"

","Amazing Experience! I felt the movie good have been a bit more longer to give space to the heroes to build their backstories. But thanks to the WB mandate of keeping the film within 2hours might have caused the backlash. I would now definitely wait for the extended version.<br/><br/>One takeaway from the film for me was Superman! He was great and the best. He is the Superman we were all longing for. Even the mightiest Steppenwolf was no match for him.<br/><br/>The other heroes did really well, the banters were fun. The movie can be termed as a fun and the viewers will have a good time for sure.<br/><br/>Looks like Joss Whedon have done a lot of tampering with the Visuals/Scenes which personally I am not happy but it works.<br/><br/>Coming back to the scores of the critics, I am still not sure what they are looking for in that movie. I feel the average ratings from them for all comic book movies should be 5 or 6 out of 10. As these flicks are comic book entertainment and not serious drama oriented films. We should exclude The Dark Knight series and Spiderman 2. But overall, we should not expect high scores from them. But to my surprise we see a dis balance between the Marvel and DCEU scores. Not sure the reason but I sincerely feel its not the content. <br/><br/>Coming back to the recommendation, you should watch the movie and Judge by yourself. To me the movie is 7/10, I gave 10 in IMDb just to avoid the score mismatch, because I see people intentionally giving bad scores to bring down the overall rating.<br/><br/>Verdict: Do watch and Judge by yourself and don't listen to the world!"

","It's been just 20 minutes since I left the movie theater and I'm still trembling in happiness. First of all I'm a die hard Superman fan. What an awesome movie it was! I was expecting the return of Superman but I wasn't expecting this. I of course read some theories around how he will return and on who's side he will fight. This outcome pretty much covers it all. I almost left in tears when Suprman engages Steppenwolf and I was shocked how well crafted that moment with classical Superman theme. Overall the story is very good. The movie and the characters have good sense of humor. You feel like you get to know the characters more and discover their new sides. New additions to the team Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg have a very good introduction before their own movies coming up. Characters like Batman, Superman and Wonderwoman prove that they have much to offer in upcoming years. Just like Marvel Universe and Avengers I think we will get to see more team ups even in solo movies in the future. This is first in line and with more movies of other DC characters I think there will be more addition to the Justice League in the future. At the very of end of the movie Bruce Wayne and Diana pretty much have a conversation around the same topic. There of course some weaknesses but I can't wait to see the longer Blye Ray version of this movie. I'm very satisfied overall and I will watch this movie again."

But still has some elements from it.<br/><br/>Better character development (Josh Whedon ?), fight scenes still look like video game scenes, some scenes are rushed to be shrunk in an 2-hours movie,... <br/><br/>The Villain is boring. After hiring Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, Cara Delevingne in Suicide Squad (not related to her BTW), the DCEU is still continuing with plain and boring villains.<br/><br/>Conclusion: a bit messy.<br/><br/>Not the film of the year but improvement from BvS but not enough to be attached to the characters."

"joshualawrencepike","9","24","45","25 November 2017"," As good as the avengers
","To be clear I did not have high expectations for Justice League. I was thinking it was going to be Batman V Superman but with more characters and plot turns. So worth watching for the action, but little else. But boy was I wrong, it was very good, surprisingly so.<br/><br/>Going through the list of things I though would tank it but it did well instead:<br/><br/>First they had to introduce three new characters, Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. I though this would drag things down or the characters would end up flat because they could not afford enough time to flesh them out. Neither happened, little time was spent on them but it was time well spent. They showed the characters, they did not just tell us about them. We did not get much backstory but we did get to know them as characters. The actors of all three characters deserved all the money they got and then some.<br/><br/>Second I thought it would have a consistent joyless tone through the whole movie. While the start was kind of joyless, it was not near as bad as Batman V Superman. And unlike in Batman V Superman the tone at the start helps the movie. Its a movie about making things better, so starting joyless works (like horror movies starting happy). Things get better as the movie progresses and there are even jokes (good ones even).<br/><br/>The third was that the plot would be too complex and would twist too many times (looking at you spiderman 3), and they would leave you in the dust trying to deal with that AND all the new characters. That did not happen partly because they knew their limits and kept the plot simple but workable. The bad guy was not complex, as he is not the point of the movie, he starts the ball rolling but he is not the star. While simple the stakes are shown to be very high, and the bad guys power is never in doubt. While I do hope for a more complex one in the next movie, in this one the focus had to be on the league.<br/><br/>One final note is I really like where they are taking Batman. He is old and he shows it, they did not have him take on things that a normal guys should not be able to. The movie as a whole can be seen as him trying to hope, trying to be more like superman. He fails sometimes but he tries, again and again. THAT is a batman I want to see on the big screen.<br/><br/>www.JoshuaLawrencePike.com"
"jbsa007-880-517898","9","24","45","15 November 2017"," Justice League (9/10 Stars) ""Seeing is Believing""
","""May Contain Spoilers"" <br/><br/>For a first time DC Comics Version of Superheros Ensemble, surely is worth watching but unfair to compare with the benchmark that was set by The Dark Knight Trilogies or even the first Comic-book Superhero Ensemble Movie ""Avengers"".<br/><br/>One can surely expect from typical cynics to regurgitate the very criticisms they used for ""Batman v Superman"" and use that for this film. The only major downside of this film, was the Main Antagonist himself ""Steppenwolf"" as there was no realism about him and too much CGI for the Main Antagonist.<br/><br/>The takeover by Joss Whedon for the finishing touches of this film surely can be seen as a blessing in disguise and that what makes this film all the more better than the typical dark sided tasteless Zack Synder type films. Personally, this movie would have been a whole lot better had it been directed entirely by Joss Whedon or even Christopher Nolan.<br/><br/>Given this is the first of it's kind from DC Comics and the Run-time restrictions set by Warner Bros. Execs themselves; so personally giving 9/10 Stars is purely because of the expected regurgitated criticisms and the negative ratings that follows.<br/><br/>""Seeing is Believing""...So go see for yourselves rather than read the expected regurgitated criticisms that follows and give at least more than 8/10 as rating anywhere.

"fredschaefer-406-623204","8","16","28","25 November 2017"," Waited a long time to see The Flash on the movie screen...and it was worth it.
","A lot of us comic book fans have waited a very long time to get a JUSTICE LEAGUE movie, and we certainly had high hopes for it after the smashing success of WONDER WOMAN this past summer. Does this movie live up to those high hopes? As usual, the answer is both yes and no; JUSTICE LEAGUE is certainly an improvement on BATMAN V SUPERMAN, but this latest teaming of the Caped Crusader and the Man of Steel, again directed by Zack Snyder, never quite finds the perfect pitch that Patty Jenkins found for WONDER WOMAN. There are no painfully awkward ""Martha"" moments from Synder's first film, which is a very good thing, but this incarnation of the JL never achieves the easy camaraderie that comes so easy to many of the DC animated movies or Bruce Timm's cartoon series, although it certainly tries very hard and comes close in a number of scenes. One of the joys of a JL film is seeing the interaction between Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg, and, yes, Superman, yet this seems to be the hardest thing to pull off for a scriptwriter on the page and the actors on the screen.<br/><br/>The story picks up where B v S left off as Bruce Wayne/Batman goes about assembling a team to meet the sinister cosmic threat that was hinted at the end of the earlier film. DC already screwed this premise up with SUICIDE SQUAD, and we do have to go through the requisite scenes where Bruce Wayne if initially rebuffed by Aquaman, has the novice Barry Allen jump at the chance to work with the big guys, while Wonder Woman tries to convince a reluctant Cyborg to join up. I give them credit for dispensing with a lot clunky origin exposition scenes and dialog, which keeps the movie down of a very manageable two hour running time (a Warner Bros mandate). But I wouldn't have minded if they jumped into a story where the Justice League was already formed and ready to go; we simply do not need to waste any more time telling back story. By my count, there were at least four well staged action scenes where heroes and villains throw down, including a flashback battle sequence that will bring joy to any DC comic fan, the resurrection of Superman, and the final confrontation in a village in Russia. This is what brings us fans to the theater.<br/><br/>For me, the Big Bad, Steppenwolf, is a problem in that he is just another big ugly and angry super powered brute bent on taking over/destroying the Earth for no other real reason than he is just hateful and mean. Steppenwolf, a ten foot tall CGI creation, voiced by the excellent actor, Ciaran Hinds, is almost interchangeable with Ares from WONDER WOMAN, Ronan the Accuser from GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, or that other super tall guy from SUICIDE SQUAD. One good thing about Steppenwolf is that he is a brawler, so we are spared another climax where two super beings hurl bolts of energy at each other until one just gives up. I would add this, if you are going to use characters from Jack Kirby's New Gods, go really big and give us Darkseid himself, along with all his minions, don't hold back for a sequel that may never get produced.<br/><br/>I think Ben Affleck is the best Bruce Wayne/Batman after Michael Keaton, and Henry Cavil (and his big white teeth) makes for good Superman – at least they let him smile in this one. Gal Gadot is just as impressive here as she was in her stand alone film, in fact, I wish they had given her more to do. Amy Adams and Diane Lane are back as Lois Lane and Martha Kent, along with Jeremy Irons as Alfred. Ray Fisher makes a good impression as Cyborg, even if his character is underdeveloped. The newcomers who make the best impression are Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman, who is properly physically imposing, along with having a great voice, and Ezra Miller as Barry Allen/The Flash. The Flash might be my favorite DC hero, and I wasn't bothered by Miller's unique take on him: playing Barry as a Jewish nerd, at least he gets the best lines in the movie. Seeing J.K. Simmons as Inspector Gordon only made me hope that much more that he will reprise his J. Jonah Jameson in the next Spider-Man movie.<br/><br/>JUSTICE LEAGUE has under performed, which means that if the DC movie universe is to continue, there will surely be some changes going forward; Affleck and Cavil could be jettisoned and their parts recast, along with the sacking of Zack Snyder. This is may be because of the lingering animosity from BATMAN V SUPERMAN, which earned the eternal fury of many die-hard fans, so much so, that many of them wanted nothing to do with another film with the same production team and stars. One thing I would suggest Warner Brothers do is hire Joss Whedon, who did extensive re-shoots on the film after Snyder had to abruptly leave (Whedon may be responsible for much of the humor in the film), and bring back Richard Donner, even if he is too old to direct another movie, he should certainly be consulted on the script and production, as his first Superman movie is still the best take on any DC hero and the one that set the mold.<br/><br/>There are two post credits scenes, one where two heroes attempt to answer and age old fan question, and another that brings back a previous villain (and his controversial casting), but also has appearance by a universally favorite bad guy. This scene alone, gives me hope that we will see the JL on the screen once again in some form."

","When inhabitants on Earth want to violate their stay by creating chaos all around them, it's up to superheroes in all walks of life that are there to stop them and they make films like these their own. Under the direction of Zack Snyder ""Justice League"" features all of our beloved characters from the DC Universe in an epic showdown between good and evil.<br/><br/>From the early stages it comes unsurprisingly that this is an origin story of creating a league of iconic superheroes like Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman who have always been favourites among the DC Universe in both live-action and animated films but it was refreshing to add in three familiar characters from DC's past and join forces who have yet to shine in live-in solo projects on their own (though Aquaman successfully did in 2018). What was remarkable was that they formed this alliance right away and got right into the story without wasting a moment of your time.<br/><br/>After the horrific death of Superman (Henry Cavill), Batman (Ben Affleck) decides that since he can't handle this mission on his own, he gathers up other superheroes in a epic battle to save humanity from an impending invasion. Erza Miller joins the troop as Barry Allen better known as The Flash who's both energetic, determined and insecure. Jason Momoa brings life into Arthur Curry/Aquaman who's both physically strong but very head-strong too. And Ray Fisher shines as Victor Stone/ Cyborg who brings his heart to the game though tries to find purpose behind is all very understanding.<br/><br/>We're glad to see Gal Gadot back as Diana Prince/ Wonder Woman who is still grieving and questioning herself in saving humanity while mourning the death of Steve Trevor. At the same time we understand Batman's situation as he's showing his age and that his composure is waning as he's aware that he will retire very shortly.<br/><br/>Though the superheroes are fleshed out nicely, it's a shame that the villain doesn't get the same treatment. Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds) is just another underdeveloped villain from the planet Apokolips who sends his Parademons on Earth to search for three Mother Boxes with no real scenes from him that one could describe as memorable. Marvel Studios are famous for unmemorable villains too.<br/><br/>While clocking in at the two hour mark, it shows that the narrative is way too simplified. I understand that some people think two and half hours might be labouring, but by rushing into the action and gathering these superheroes we get little to saviour the moments and get to know why they're chosen into this deadly mission. There are also tedious moments where events are just patched on just to create an incoherent series of events which makes the flow of the story underwhelming.<br/><br/>And sure we comic book hero fans understand that underneath the their costumes and traits they bring to the fight are impressive, we also know that they are all humans underneath. In the graveyard scene conversation between Cyborg and Flash, we see the effort to make them more human, but it still looked more cheapened than fleshed out.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Justice League"" is remarkable film that features all the classic heroes from the DC Universe with plenty of exciting action, with likable characters and potential to have future installments in the future. It brings a great feeling of joy like being a kid again."
"greggriffin-30137","9","15","26","25 November 2017"," Benefits From Great Casting
","It must be next-to-impossible to perfectly cast some of the most iconic characters of all time. The big three here are perfectly cast and they have great chemistry. The chemistry between Bruce and Diana, specifically, drives much of the film. <br/><br/>Aquaman is not the train wreck that I thought he would be. He takes Arthur in a completely different direction, but it works. Cyborg is way more interesting than he was in the Wolfman/Perez Titans books from the 80s. Flash continues to be portrayed in a way that is different than anything that I've ever read in a DC book but he provides comic relief and is quite entertaining. <br/><br/>The film is fast-paced and is just like a comic book come to life.

"alexdisney-64015","9","23","43","26 November 2017"," It is Justice League!
","So, Justice League, first i think i should start by tell my opinions of other DCEU movies, i love Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, i don't like Suicide Squad and i think Wonder Woman is fantastic. Going into Justice League was first of all dream come true, as big fan of characters and what they stand for. Just imagine this movie 57 years in the making since first Justice League appearance. Yeah, yeah but what about quality of the film, be honest it's a mixed bag even i enjoyed a lot, so let's start with goods. I love characters and every actor did a good job, stand out for me was Superman, in preparation for this movie a watched every Superman movie since 1978 and see character done so right was awesome. Flash was great comic relief and Ezra Miller bring his own to the role very well. Wonder Woman, Batman, Aquaman and even Cyborg who i tough by trailers will be a weak link, they all was best part of the movie. I love a lot of moments and scenes from film, for example opening Batman scene, Aquaman going to the Atlantis with Icky Thump playing, return of Superman, Danny Elfman soundtrack, final shots of the film, they all was amazing and bring my score so high and tear to my eye. Unfortunate movie has problems, villain, some plot elements, final battle location where you don't care and don't feel stakes. It's all there, but for me so many good stuff for sure beats not so good. For overall this is the Justice League and now road to the future look really good and full of potential, even movie not was perfect, so many positive stuff in there, that i don't even mention deserve a praise. I would love to write and talk about this a lot more and this movie for sure deserve a examine and would love to be just fly on set on this thing. To get to the end i really, really like film and hope you can enjoyed as well, movie is fun, exciting and special, come on, what other time you will be seeing Superman 1978, Batman 1989, Dark Knight, Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, first JUSTICE LEAGUE on big screen of your favorite movie theater. So go out there and have good time. By the way can't wait for ultimate edition of this movie. Thank you for reading review, what year we have for comic book movies Logan, Lego Batman, Guardians, Spider- Man, Thor, Wonder Woman and Justice League, what a time to be alive! :)"
"djordje-hoger","8","23","43","25 November 2017"," Honestly its pretty good
","I chose to write this review after reading all the negative press and reviews in the media.<br/><br/>Let me be clear I am no action super hero buff, I took my kids to watch it as they have been bouncing off the walls with excitement waiting for it to come out. As such I went in with low expectations given the huge amounts of negative press.<br/><br/>Am I a film critic, well no, but am I film buff, the answer is firmly yes, and as someone that is not really a super hero fan I can give an unbiased opinion.<br/><br/>The film is generally pretty good, is it perfect clearly not, but for two hours you can sit back and watch a good old fashioned pop corn flick.<br/><br/>Pros The heroes gel really well, the on screen chemistry is great, Ezra Miller as the flash is absolutely hilarious. The film has a lot more humour in it vs. previous DC films and the plot, although as ridiculous as most super hero films, is actually easy to understand and explained. OK so there are some glaring holes, such as no-one explaining how Clark Kent will explain how he came back from the dead but how people can get fussy about plots that are based on super humans and aliens baffles me. Aquaman adds a different layer of humour to the script and wonderwoman fans will be happy as well. The scene where the amazons fight Steppen Wolfe is arguably one of the best in the entire film.<br/><br/>Cons Henry Caville's CGI's upper lip,and the CGI bad guy. You struggle to hate the villain as you can't really consider him as real.<br/><br/>The fact is that I don't see how the film has got such bad reviews, it almost feels like the critics are punishing this film in an attempt to kill of the super hero genre. For most people who want to switch off for 120 mins this film will do the job, and the kids will love it."

","The movie is an epic come together of some of the most iconic heroes in the DC Universe.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the jokes are kept to a minimum and only on occasions that warrant a joke or a punchline. There is no comic relief when the situation is dire on-screen.<br/><br/>The heroes are exactly what you expect them to be (for those who know the comics and the characters) and their reactions are true both to their character and the situation that arises around them.<br/><br/>It is the first glimpse to the extended universe of DC, which promises to be spectacular."

","the movie is fun to watch, I am a DC fan, I have to admit it so I have watched this movie about 5 times to fully get all the stuff this movie offered. Differently, from the edgy tone of Suicide Squad or Batman vs Superman, this movie is just like a real-life version of the old justice league animated series. The movie has its moment, maybe too long with too much detail just in case for newcomers, and I am OK with that. What I'm trying to say is, don't expect an Oscar worthy movie or a deeply underrated masterpiece like Watchmen, the movie is fun to watch, it has its tone, one of the closest live action of the old justice league animated series. 9/10 because there is no green lantern, there cant be any justice league without Hal Jordan or John Steward"
"kejgonzo","10","22","41","25 November 2017"," What an incredible film!!! Marvelous in every way
","Just recently saw Justice League today and I have to say, as someone who took awhile to watch it and has been anticipating it for sometime, I have to say WOW what a film. The film was excellent from start to finish, people who say this film was bad or this film was not good are really acting like they're a film critic. Its a FICTION film people!! not to be taken so seriously. The character development was great for each character which they don't want to so too much because they have their own films in development in their own right. As a comic book nerd and fanboy I can tell I can die happy now because it was everything that I wanted to Justice League. Barry Allen stole the show, Aquaman was awesome, I liked how they went more into Batman's story, Superman was brief but great to have him back, Cyborg was really my favorite among everyone. Don't know why but liked his character development the most. An cant forget about Diana aka Wonder Woman who is beautiful and strong as usual. Something about that woman. Cant wait what DCEU has in store oh and stay for the wtf after credits scene."
"fordeffects","8","22","41","25 November 2017"," Pretty Good!!
","Was Justice League everything I was hoping for? Nope! There are some things I would've wanted done differently, but I could say that about a lot of movies, so I am trying to judge this by the content we got and not the content I wanted. <br/><br/>So I gave it 8 stars, and that seems pretty high considering all the hate the movie is getting. It definitely doesn't deserve higher in my opinion, but I don't really see it deserving less than a 5 either. My favorite thing about this movie was the cast, by far. Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot are fantastic. Ben Affleck is really good too. I've always been kind of on the edge with his portrayal of Batman. It is not always my cup of tea, but I enjoyed him in this movie. Ray Fisher did okay as Cyborg. I'll expand on my opinion of Cyborg later in the review. Jason Momoa as Aquaman was interesting (he will also come up again later in the review). And lastly Ezra Miller was fine as the Flash. I did have a hard time adjusting to Miller's version of the Flash, as I am a very bug fan of Grant Gustin's version in the CW TV show. That being said, he did a good job! It just took some adjusting since his character seems particularly socially awkward compared to Gustin's portrayal which seems very extroverted by comparison. So Miller did not do bad at all, and I did like it! <br/><br/>So for anyone who hasn't guessed, I have severely limited comic knowledge. My full knowledge is based on the CW shows (which I understand is not a good source for comic relevance) and some of the post-New 52 Batman comics. As such, I know basically nothing about Aquaman or Cyborg coming into this movie. I know that Aquaman is from Atlantis and that he can survive underwater, and that is the extent of my knowledge. Cyborg...I have absolutely no knowledge of ahead of time, aside from his appearance in the original Teen Titans animated series. Characters such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman are easy to follow because (for the men at least) their stories are iconic, and everyone has some inkling of an idea of who they are, what happened to them, and what they can do (and for Wonder Woman, her standalone movie obviously does a fantastic job informing everyone of her story). I felt the same with the Flash, since I have knowledge from the CW show, which seems to share a vaguely similar origin story with the version seen in the movie. This leaves us with Aquaman and Cyborg as our outliers. I enjoyed their portrayals, and I was interested in their characters, but I had no real attachment to either of them. That is one of my biggest complaints. As much as the public seems to be against superhero origin movies anymore, I feel like these two deserved to have one. Their histories are not widely known by people who are not faithful comic readers, and as such, some more information regarding them would have been nice going into this movie. Just something extra so that I have more reason to care about what happens to them.<br/><br/>My other main gripe with Justice League is the main villain. And lets be clear, I actually liked Steppenwolf as the villain, I found him kind of interesting overall. However, he was, overall, forgettable. He did not receive enough screen time for me to really get to understand or care about his motivations. I feel like the best kind of villain is one that is either coherent enough that I understand why they are doing what they are doing (maybe I'm even rooting for them in a way), or crazy enough that they are frightening and need to be taken down. Steppenwolf wasn't crazy really, nor did I really follow his plan too well. But he was kind of scary, so I was alright with him overall. What I did not like was his disposable army. But, I feel anyone who complains about it in this movie and not in Marvel's The Avengers is hypocritical. Both movies have the same fault that there is this army helping the main villain, yet they are not helpful to him in the least, and our heroes pretty much don't even really struggle against them. This is something that many movies like this do, so I'm trying not to be too harsh on it. The CGI isn't top notch either, but it did end up being better than I expected.<br/><br/>All things considered - this movie is fun. For the most part, the jokes land well, the characters are interesting, and the story is still enjoyable. Aside from one or two odd lines of dialogue and two extremely goofy Batman reactions to something happening, I think the movie was great. It had a decent plot and a fun cast. It wasn't perfect, but it set up the future of DC movies pretty well, and I left the theatre pleasantly surprised. I don't mean to compare it to Marvel, as it is indeed different, but I'd say it was *at least* as good Avengers: Age of Ultron. Probably a little better. So, in that comparison: there was a lot that could be improved, but in no way would I ever say this movie was bad. It was good, and even though it didn't completely blow me away, I still feel comfortable saying that I 100% recommend it, because it was still fun, different, and a positive direction for the DCEU."

"mnaselli","9","13","22","26 November 2017"," Went In With Low Expectations And Came Out Happy
","I went in with low expectations because of all the bad reviews, but was pleasantly surprised. Warner Brothers listened to the complaints from Batman V Superman and made the script funny, witty, fun. It had action, drama, and was a lovely colorful ride. They finally got Superman right. I'm actually a bit miffed at how the reviews are so low. DC can't seem to win. I read some complaints that the character development wasn't enough. Really? These characters have been in the collective consciousness for decades. Superman and Batman has been around since the 1930's and Wonderwoman has been around since the 1940s. Do we really need more character development. I love that they got right into it with out all the boring repetitive back stuff. It's too dark they complain so they listened and made it light. Now, they complain it's to light. Ugh. I loved it. Don't let the Critics spoil your time or make you prejudice against it. I think a lot of critics are copy cat reviewers and once a trend gets started they all copy each other. If you go in with an open mind, you'll come out happy."
"shawneofthedead","6","43","88","15 November 2017"," It's far from great, and not always very good, but at least it steers clear of awful.
","What would you do if three out of four films in your blockbuster superhero franchise aren't particularly good? When going forward with the fifth film (the all-important one that ties everything together and launches it into the stratosphere), do you stick with what you know? Or do you try to learn from the outpouring of love and acclaim that greeted Wonder Woman, the outlying fourth film? Do you add more humour and a dash of fun to the generally dark, dour proceedings? Do you refine your script to focus a little more on character and less on bombastic spectacle? In the case of Justice League, the answers – and corresponding results – are mixed. (Kinda, kinda, yes, kinda, by the way.) <br/><br/>Justice League opens in the wake of Superman's (Cavill) death. The world – and his erstwhile frenemy Bruce Wayne/Batman (Affleck) – are in a dark depression. But cataclysmic sieges on a planetary scale wait for no man (or woman). Steppenwolf (played by Hinds via motion-capture), an ancient, alien evil that once tried to claim Earth as his own, has returned with an army of fear-fuelled parademons. Bruce realises that, without Superman as the first and best line of defense, he needs to assemble a team (a 'justice league', as it were) to save the world.<br/><br/>Consequently, the first half of the film is rather exposition-heavy, as it busily sets up its characters, relationships and stakes. Bruce reunites with Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gadot), just as she's begun to step out from beneath the shadow of grief. We also get to know the other potential League members that we've only glimpsed in passing – snarky speedster Barry Allen/Flash (Miller); sassy fish-whisperer Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Momoa); and surly human machine Victor Stone/Cyborg (Fisher).<br/><br/>Thankfully, Justice League isn't as relentlessly dark and joy-free as director Zack Snyder's previous entries in the DCEU. While there's nothing wrong with going full grim when putting superheroes on screen (Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy proved that you could do so with depth, flair and intelligence to burn), Snyder's Man Of Steel and Batman Vs. Superman were curiously bleak pictures. Stuffed with bombastic spectacle and testosterone- charged face-offs, both films were more or less dreadful, displaying a fundamental misunderstanding of their main characters. (Cavill's broody Superman, in particular, is a painfully misguided interpretation of DC Comics' most iconic superhero, a literal and figurative beacon of light.) <br/><br/>In contrast, there's a brighter vein of hope and humour threaded throughout Justice League, though it's unclear just how much of that can be credited directly to Snyder. The main reason for that is the involvement of Joss Whedon, who wrote and directed Marvel's two enormously successful and largely acclaimed Avengers films. Initially brought on to doctor the script, Whedon wound up overseeing post- production on the film (including significant reshoots), after Snyder chose to take some time off for very sad personal reasons.<br/><br/>Without question, the final film benefits from the injection of Whedon's signature banter and his ability to effectively juggle multiple character narratives. Whether it's Barry and Victor bonding in a graveyard or Arthur's big speech before the final battle, Whedon contributes some of the most purely fun – and funny – moments in the DCEU to date.<br/><br/>Characters and relationships, though more sketched than fleshed out, work well enough. As the film progresses, each member of the fledgling League works out who they want to be, as people and as the earth's self-appointed defenders. The newcomers are all decent, though not quite the breakout successes the studio is no doubt hoping for. Miller's Flash starts out adorable but ends up annoying. Momoa is underserved by the script, but nails the swagger. With just half his face to work with, Fisher amps up the angst while buried beneath some oddly ugly character design.<br/><br/>As for DC's Big Three, it can be tough to buy into Diana's decades-long descent into grief following the character-defining climax of Wonder Woman. But, given that her arc is necessarily dictated by earlier narrative decisions, Gadot finds some lovely emotional beats to play as Diana chooses to lead and share her light with the world. The film also nudges the hitherto badly-botched relationship between the late Superman and Lois Lane (Amy Adams, still criminally underused) in a better direction.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise of Justice League is how Affleck's Batman – almost rabidly xenophobic in Batman Vs. Superman – grounds both the film and the team. There's something hauntingly poetic about watching this taciturn loner, who could so easily hide himself away in a fortress of wealth and power, trying to atone for the world's loss of Superman. Embracing the fact that he's by far the most mortal member of the League, the film finds the heroism in Batman's humanity.<br/><br/>For all that it gets right, though, Justice League suffers for being what it largely still is: a Snyder blockbuster. He tends to favour overblown spectacle and one-dimensional villains, both of which culminate in the peculiarly unmenacing Steppenwolf – a CGI-drenched creation that manages to be hammy and fake all at once. The plot is, somehow, stupidly convoluted and insultingly simple at the same time. ('Mother Boxes' must be another way of spelling 'MacGuffin'.) And, while absolutely everything about this film is better than what Snyder has produced before, it still never quite grabs the heart.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Justice League is a step in the right direction. It doesn't reach the glorious heights of Wonder Woman, but it doesn't regress to the murky depths of Batman Vs. Superman either. With its story and characters turned firmly towards the light, there might be hope for this franchise yet."

","First things first- never rely on critics' ratings before watching a superhero movie. Because, a superhero movie is not at all meant to be critically acclaimed, its about satisfying your fans who want to see their heroes on screen.
Now coming to the movie Justice League. Even though they couldn't pull of a 'The Avengers ' level movie, they managed to give the justice league franchise a decent start. The movie is well paced,you wont feel like its slow anywhere. Actually i felt they could have slowed the movie down a bit. They could have given a better build up to the introduction of their heroes one by one in the beginning,like marvel did in The Avengers. Someplaces CGI wasnt upto the mark. In some places it looked like a gameplay rather than a movie(it could actually work for some people). The dialogues were funny and witty sometimes. Not that strong a story, but they didnt let the audience feel bored at any point of time.
Overall its an entertaining 2 hours. They managed to give the justice league a good start, but they could have done better.

"kermitkid","9","11","18","31 March 2020"," It's no ""Avengers"", but it doesn't need to be
","Once again, the critics are wrong. This. was. Awesome! You know you're in for a fun time when ""Written by Joss Whedon"" pops up on the screen! It's got almost everything a Justice League movie should have. Humor, action, witty dialogue....It's almost on par with Marvel. Almost. Really, my only negative critique is the villain was really dumb. It's a Justice League movie and they give us Steppenwolf?! Really?! Even when Steppenwolf shows up, he doesn't do anything. The battle is over as quickly as it begins. The 3rd act and/or villain really should have been changed. But, hey, this movie managed to make Aquaman awesome! He's like a cross between a heavy metal guitarist and a professional wrestler. Everything about him is awesome, including the self-awareness that for the past 76 years, he's been a joke. He's the character that doesn't take no for an answer, doesn't care what people think of him, and is just awesome! The only character cooler than him is Batman, and that's because he's Batman. I did have one more problem with the story. If you're a casual fan without any knowledge as to who Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg are you may be confused as their origin stories are only glanced over or completely ignored. If they had given it another hour to take time to explain the characters' backstories that would have been super helpful. Instead we need to rely on context clues through quick dialogue. Hopefully we get an extended cut on the Bluray. It has some problems, but it's definitely a step in the right direction. At the end of the day, I was entertained, and that;s all that matters. By the way, stay ALL the way through the credits. There are 2 scenes.

He had to sport a mustache for his role in the latter project, however Paramount refused to let the actor shave it off for the time he played Superman again. This meant that Cavill's facial hair had to be digitally removed in post-production. Extensive reshoots in London and Los Angeles in mid-2017 added a cost of approximately $25 million to the film's budget. Gal Gadot's work on ""Justice League"" began the day after she wrapped production on ""Wonder Woman."" The line-up in this film is based on the founding members from the New 52 origin story (with the exception of Green Lantern). During the Silver Age origin story, Martian Manhunter was one of the founding members. He was replaced with Cyborg (who was previously known as a founding member of the New Teen Titans) in the New 52 version.<br/><br/>
*Emotion- A fun and adventurous film. The villain part of this plot and his task to conquer Earth was very disappointing. The super villain, 'Steppenwolf' was terrible and unbelievable. His back story was un-interesting and much to simplistic to get the audience much involved in it. As such the film larger plot suffered for me.<br/><br/>*Based On- From D.C. comics story."

Superheroes is not always about happy colorful movie, beat the hell outta enemies and life happily. What they face is more, doubt, dilemma, tragedy and more and more. And it's not always about the kids (actually there's more adult dominated the theater)<br/><br/>About the actions, like I said ""the realest superhero movie"", man... Aliens is not easily defeated just so you know, Steppenwolf and friends are more like above average, which says they got technology, ya know what I'm saying? but they also have limited bullets on their guns (realest, remember?) There's no way normal men would survive them, I actually worried what's gonna happen to Bruce and Barry. But they keeping distance and still fighting, Batsy is braver than before (about facing aliens n stuffs, you'll see). I think Bruce is seeking forgiveness and redemption, blaming himself for what happened in the past.<br/><br/>There's so much on my mind that I wanted to put into words, but like other DC diehards... We won't spoil too much, I can only thank Zack Snyder for making all these happens. I mean this is like a dream came true. It's wonderful, it feels real.<br/><br/>Before you watch the movie, make sure you free yourself from hatred and critics or whatever bothering you. Embrace what you gonna watch and feel, I warned you!<br/><br/>Regards, your fellow DC diehards. you're not alone. Love!"
"boullosa","Null","26","50","15 November 2017"," Great movie
","A nice, entertaining, and very well done movie from WB/DCEU. I didn't feel the two hours passing, so immersed I was in the story and the characters. A well balanced and straight plot, with all strings in place, not losing too much time explaining origins or whatever, and putting things in a way that can make both the casual and the die hard comic fan to connect and understand them. <br/><br/>The photography is much more colorful and brighter than Batman v. Superman, as anticipated, although I'm a fan of darker movies. But it's OK, after all it's a Justice League movie, not a Dark Knight one, and Batman is supposed to be the only dark guy in the group - and Ben Affleck does an amazing job in this aspect. When Gordon says that the Cape Crusader has been fighting crime for ""the last 20 years"", you can wonder everything that he has been through during this time, including the death of Robin, as hinted in B v. SM. <br/><br/>Batman and Wonder Woman show in this movie that they form a superb duo, and you can even imagine that they could become a romantic couple someday. He brings/reveals the dark side of things, while she brings hope to everybody. She's always the center of the attentions whenever she's in the screen. Amazing work by Gal Godot. Speaking of her, a special mention must be made to the scenes in Themiscyra, which reminded me of the great Wonder Woman movie. <br/><br/>And moving from earth to water, I have also to mention the cool underwater scenes in Atlantis, which made me eager to watch the new Aquaman movie! In JL, the King of the Seven Seas brings an interesting rebel and defiant style to the group, and you can see the sparks that appear when he and Batman interact.<br/><br/>Cyborg is the only hero that I'll never get used to in the JL, since, to me, he will always be connected to the Titans, not to the ""adult"" guys. It's also a bit weird to see an almost teenager Flash, I grew up reading comics that showed an older Barry Allen. But the final result is OK, this Flash is the funny guy in the story, keeping everybody smiling, and doing a funny pair with his young fellow Victor Stone. I like to imagine this Flash as a Kid Flash that just happened to enter the League as a young apprentice together with Cyborg. And teenage fans will certainly love them. :)<br/><br/>As for Superman, this time he's much closer to the Superman people are used to (the one immortalized by Christopher Reeve), with a lighter tone, not only visually but also in mood, compared to his two previous appearances in the DCEU. I specially liked the scenes just after his resurrection. Henry Cavill once again brought us a solid performance.<br/><br/>Now moving to the bad guys, or THE bad guy, Steppenwolf was really what I was expecting from a super-villain from Apokolips, strong and bad as hell, but nevertheless no match for Superman - but who is a match for the Man of Steel, after all?<br/><br/>As for the CGI, people must understand that when you deal with superheroes- fighting-deadly-ultra-powerful-extraterrestrials, no CGI is enough to picture the fighting scenes. In this movie, the graphics were not super-stellar, but not bad either.<br/><br/>In summary, as someone who has been reading superheroes comics since the 70s (both DC and Marvel), I loved the movie, it really met (almost all) my expectations for what should be a great JL movie. The only thing that would make me happier would be the inclusion of Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter in the plot, but I hope they will appear in the sequel! Well, at least SOME Green Lantern made a short appearance in this movie, you'll notice when he's in the screen! :)<br/><br/>One last notice: stay until the end of the credits so that will can watch the final scene that connects to the next movie!"
"mishra-rishab23","10","34","68","15 November 2017"," Best Superhero Movie
","Justice League needed a live action adaption for so long. Now, after 10 years in development, we finally got the movie and it doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The founding members are Batman, Wonder Woman and joining them are Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg - it's such a disappointment that fan favourite Superman (last played by Henry Cavil) is dead. JL includes two post credit scenes and both are equally great, can't spoil them. <br/><br/>What I disliked about the movie?<br/><br/>There are some cut scenes which end abruptly. This might be due to keep-it-under-two-hours thing. Most of the sequences from trailers are cut from the movie. In the tunnel sequence when batman brings his night-crawler he says ""My turn' in the trailer and in the movie it's just another stupid joke he makes. I don't understand why Batman has suddenly become a comic character. In another scene halfway the movie batman makes a joke about something bleeding which was totally not Batman like. If someone else made that joke I could understand but this is the Goddammn Batman we are talking. He just doesn't bleed and yell.<br/><br/>I really hated the Wonder Woman and Flash sequence where he falls on her boobs. I will not talk about those ass shots.<br/><br/>For all those shouting bad CGI I didn't notice Henry Cavil's moustache. The CGI was really done. I was enjoying the movie not looking for a frame to yell 'hey look bad CGI'. Honestly I noticed it only in beginning phone recording sequence (I am sure it was inspired by Homecoming, which is really sad. WB had show little hope that They could have used such cheap shots. They could have allotted this time for more character building.<br/><br/>The road to Justice League 2 is very long. I hope it doesn't get cut down too. I can wait five or ten years for a great Justice League movie. Please WB make it happen. Don't give up yet."
"nabeelrockstar","7","20","37","25 November 2017"," Epic team up
","Batman is awesome and did a good job as a leader.Wonder woman is excellent.Flash is lightning quick in actions as well as in acting.Aquaman is aggressive and a bit emotional.Cyborg uses his tech and emotions very well. The script is good and the film runs at a good pace. Steppenwolf is a good villain and gives a tough fight to the justice league(exception- nowhere close to supes).Superman is the one who kinda steal the show."
"Carycomic","10","20","37","17 November 2017"," This movie hammers the stuffing out of ""Thor: Ragnarok!""
","I don't know what film the so-called professional critics were bad- mouthing. But, they obviously didn't watch this one. The multiplex auditorium I saw this at was nearly packed to capacity. And that was just for the early evening show!<br/><br/>Ben Affleck returns as Bruce ""Batman"" Wayne rallying all those super- beings whom Lex Luthor was interested in.<br/><br/>Jason Mamoa as Aquaman: not blond and clean-shaven like the comic book version. But, at least he doesn't have a trident-shaped prosthetic hand or over-exclaim the word ""Outrageous!"" And, even better? He _does_ wear the orange chain-mail shirt in battle.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller as the Flash: perhaps a little more nerdy than Grant Gustin (his TV-counterpart). Yet, he's just as fast...and just as loyal to his framed-for-murder dad.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman: now in the hundredth year of her exile from Paradise Island. Yet, still the most amazing Amazon mankind has ever seen.<br/><br/>And Ray Fisher as Victor ""Cyborg"" Stone: hacker supreme with butt- kicking physical moves to boot.<br/><br/>How the Dark Knight of Gotham City brings the rest of them together is half the appeal of this movie. The reason why he brings them together is a trio of mcguffins known as Mother Boxes. Apparently, Steppenwolf of the so-called New Gods needs them to phone home! But, Batman has different plans for them. How those plans ruin Steppenwolf's you'll have to see to believe...and enjoy. Suffice it to say, however, most of you will be delightfully surprised.<br/><br/>Speaking of delightful surprises; there are even a couple of sneaky epilogues, during the ending credits, that are so good they're almost Marvel-ous! <br/><br/>In other words: shell out that six or seven bucks at the box office. I guarantee you that this will be super-worth it."
"NightChild-792-522294","10","19","35","16 November 2017"," Way Better Than Avengers
","I just saw the movie and I would definitely see it over and over again. I did think there was a cheesy, campy part or two, but it is what it is. I REALLY liked Aquaman. I wish they would have made him come back at Superman after Superman knocks him away, but they blew that chance. That really would have given people a second thought about the King of Atlantis. He was such a bad-ass nonetheless. I can't wait for part 2. I wish Darkseid was going to be in it, but after the end credits, they may be heading in another direction. Definitely go see Justice League. It is definitely 2nd to Wonder Woman."

"mjplysaght","6","36","73","16 November 2017"," Entertaining but flawed
","So after seeing Batman vs Superman, I didn't exactly have high hopes for this film. The trailer, particularly, with it's sacrilegious abomination cover of the Beatles' Come Together, gave me mixed feelings about it.<br/><br/>DC have been playing catch-up with Marvel for ages, and it really shows. Half of the Justice League have already been introduced from previous films. The others (Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg) are given their proper debut here (no, I'm not counting their brief cameos in the other films) and the film does its best to integrate them into the story. <br/><br/>The film is your standard 'evil overlord tries to take over the world' plot, with Batfleck trying to assemble the Justice League. The team have some funny lines occasionally, which I feel is thanks to Joss Whedon being one of the screenwriters, but once again, the Zack Snyder tropes come to the surface with numerous sped up/slo-mo action scenes. There were also a few lines of dialogue that made me cringe.<br/><br/>The film overall is enjoyable but there are pacing issues. The villain of the piece is particularly forgettable. They try to build this sense of scale that looks grand and epic but ultimately it doesn't quite live up to the hype, in my opinion.<br/><br/>If we're talking about wasted potential, how about JK Simmons as Commissioner Gordon? I really hope he has more time to shine in future films because he had no reason to be in this film other than establishing his presence in the DC Universe. Also, speaking of wasted talent/useless characters, Amy Adams as Lois Lane... I swear to God, her character development is halted in its tracks beyond simply 'I love Superman'. It's ridiculous.<br/><br/>That aside, the main heroes perform well here. I particularly enjoyed Ezra Miller's interpretation of the Flash. Jason Momoa is just awesome in everything. Gal Gadot is great as Wonder Woman, yet again, Ray Fisher makes a good Cyborg (I found it ironic that his Dad was the actor who played Miles Dyson in Terminator 2) and Ben Affleck continues to be great as Bruce Wayne.<br/><br/>Not terrible, not fantastic, but it's in the healthy middle ground for me."
"kudlaty_true","7","24","46","15 November 2017"," Wow. I didn't see that coming
","Wow. I've just watched Justice League and have to admit, I don't know if it's my incredibly low - or virtually nonexistent - expectations, or the fact, that I'm a little sick right now, or the low price of admission, but this movie is the first one in the DC extended Universe, after Man of steel, that genuinely surprised me! (Wonder Woman was a film that was more needed for women in the movie industry, than a phenomenon which everybody seems to be calling) I can't seem to think of anything that would greatly bother me here. The movie isn't boring at all, there's plenty of action, the heroes all work together, they fight together, make good use of their abilities, they banter a lot between each other, got their backs when it's needed, nobody is exaggerated, the power level of individual character is true to the scenario (Batman is still just a strong human and Superman is an invincible alien)... I don't know, it all just clicked like two pieces of Legos. Interactions between them are funny when they should be, and where they shouldn't, there is some intrigue and a little drama. Flash isn't infantile or annoying (trailers marketed him that way). Aquaman isn't some big jock (similar). Cyborg... OK, Cyborg is there to push the plot forward, but even that works somehow. What's even more appreciated, there are moments, which make the heroes tonally appropriate. For instance, the scene where Superman shows up and does what he does, the moment with flash and later with Batman are instant gold. This one scene more than makes up for whole BvS movie. Right now I'm fresh from the viewing, so I'm seeing through pink glasses and I won't complain about one dimensional antagonist, or constant jumping from location to location without any coherent time frame or other flaws, which the film definitely has. Also, I won't compare it to Avengers, because I feel that's kind of a different movie overall, but my impressions after I left the Justice League are definitely on the good side, not the other way around, so for me it's a very pleasant feeling after all of the previous DCEU movies experienced on the big screen. But hey, what do I know? I'm the guy who didn't like Thor 3 AT ALL and thought that X-men: Apocalypse wasn't as bad as everybody thinks."

","justice league animated series was my favourite. and justice league flash point paradox is my favorite superhero movie after the dark knight. but this zack snyder movie was not good at all. .. 1.

They never showed this scene. . 2. i was hoping for green lantern cameo or something epic. but only suspense in movie was superman's return, which is obvious. . 3. darkseid? they never showed him. . 4. The villain? after general zord then doomsday what we got in justice league? weakest villain ever, superman didn't took a punch from him, while doomsday was able to beat him. . 5. If superman is more powerful than ww, aquaman and cyborg combined and also as fast as flash then why you need a team? . 6. the ending? opening was good, middle part was better but ending? superman just came and beat the hell out of villain and paradeamons were like krybots of power ranger(completely useless) . 7. Batman's dream in bvs? I thought they will show here- ""listen to me, lois is the key"" what happened to that segment? . so overall i am disappointed, they reduced showtime to just 110 minutes, didn't showed many scenes which were in trailer itself. .so stop fooling yourself.my all 4 friend were angry at me, due to this movie. We need something better from DC than a strait laced movie."

","Wow, I'm blown awaaaaaaaaaaaaay! I have so much hope for Justice League and and I'm not disappointed. Joss Weldon has given his touch on each character development because that exactly what we want to see on super heroes collaboration. <br/><br/>Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa steal the show. The Villain Steppenwolf have a weak of performance but the chemistry between the character is so solid, you just cant have enough of them! The plot is simple and predictable in good ways with surprises in the end. I enjoying every second of this movie and that is the most important.. <br/><br/>On my opinion, Justice League is second best after the Dark Knight Trilogy and the best among DCU movies. DC, you must keep Joss Weldon for the sequel. I already have another tickets on Friday, I cant wait to watch it again!"
"bkrauser-81-311064","6","35","71","15 November 2017"," Bloated and Poorly Executed...so an Improvement
","If Batman V Superman is the oozing, puss-filled, body wound to the DCEU than Justice League is the haphazardly applied bandage that's currently dressing it. It works at least as far as mitigating the damage, stopping the bleeding and keeping this ugly-looking spectacle alive, but it's not exactly the miracle cure for the mountains of ills currently plaguing the DCEU that fans were hoping for. What exactly does that make Suicide Squad; I don't know, probably the gangrene? <br/><br/>Seemingly only a couple of weeks since the death of Superman, Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince aka Batman and Wonder Woman preemptively team-up to protect the world from external threat. To help them, they recruit young upstarts Barry Allen and Victor Stone aka The Flash and Cyborg; as well as marine demigod Arthur Curry aka Aquaman. This is so they can face down the eventual threat of the sinister Steppenwolf and his army of fear-fueled creatures from places unknown aka some inter-dimensional/space traveling hypno-beam (the film is not clear on this point).<br/><br/>Starting with the good, the films as-of-yet introduced superheroes are interesting enough characters handled with the best of care by their actors. Miller especially does an excellent job keeping the mirth coming while staying true to the spirit and tone of The Flash and movie respectively. Momoa straight up shows up as Momoa sans the dreads but the rock star bravado he's known for works and works well all things considered. Fisher pulls double duty as a near constant fountain of exposition as well as a living breathing character worth investing in. It doesn't always work given the paragraphs worth of beans he needs to spill but at least no one is calling him the professor yet.<br/><br/>The brightest star however is Gadot whose stunning beauty and otherworldly accent perfectly encapsulates every superficial thing we love about Wonder Woman. On a deeper level, Diana's naivetÃ© from the fondly revered Wonder Woman movie is gone, but what's still there is an inner strength that both serves to ground this movie, while being an understandable progression of a character now centuries old.<br/><br/>The fact that Wonder Woman is the only character worth not just caring for but believing in should be an indication of what's the biggest problem with this movie. Even with the Batman in the mix, the stitched-together cadre feels less like the world's mightiest heroes and more like a League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. They're given just enough time to go over their skill set and motivations but its all bullet points and untrimmed fat that at times derails the film's pacing. Take a scene transition early on where Bruce Wayne is buttering up Aquaman. This scene is then set against Wonder Woman's action-packed introduction, an edit that arguably works on a narrative level but feels jammed in there like a Janis Joplin tune played just after a cover of ""Come Together"".<br/><br/>What's worse, Justice League always seems to be in a rush to get somewhere guaranteeing moments of depth and exposition stick out harshly against the action. Bruce Wayne jets here and there, Steppenwolf picks a fight with the Amazons and the Atlantians, Wonder Woman comes swooping through a terrorist plot etc. It's all action-packed in its own bruising, unremarkable way, but none of it is good at conveying information, establishing stakes or forwarding the plot.<br/><br/>Luckily the plot is so simple as to ensure the slow bits are over quickly. Evil-because-he's-evil Steppenwolf wants all the shiny cubes and our protagonists are doing everything in their power to stop him. That's basically it, a first draft good versus evil macguffin hunt that seems to be avoiding themes from the other films until a certain subplot makes it impossible. It doesn't add anything to the genre that they're fighting the third DC villain in five movies with a horned helmet on some power trip about world destruction but at least it makes sense this time around.<br/><br/>And before you go huffing and puffing about how the complex mythology behind Superman, Darkseid and the infinite Earth crisis is justification for the repetitiveness; you need to first read the forthcoming sentence aloud and slowly. Movies do not require homework! Knowing the larger purpose and machinations of a motherbox is no more an indication of this movies quality than reading The Dark Knight Returns retroactively makes BvS not a pile of garbage. Enough makes sense this time around but it's still repetitive.<br/><br/>And can we take a moment to talk about Batfleck again? I was very loudly not a fan of his older, reactionary Batman in BvS but since that movie was such a dumpster fire, I was willing to give everyone involved a mulligan so long as this one was at least passable. It is, but the poor man still looks like a bewildered stepfather who won the part in a raffle and continues wearing the cowl because his stepson finally thinks he's cool. It's just not a good use of your Affleck. Affleck is good for two things: being an a**hole and being a quiet blank slate a la his character in Argo. Batman is neither of those things but thanks to Affleck he comes across as both. Not something you want for the founder of the Justice League.<br/><br/>A reported $25 million worth of reshoots, the unexpected absence of director Zack Snyder due to personal reasons and a shaky foundation built upon the most hated franchise movie to come out since Batman & Robin; it's actually kind of impressive this thing didn't turn out worse. It's not up to the level of another team-up movie that shall remain nameless but at least with Justice League, DC and Warner Bros. prove they're slowly learning from their mistakes. I admire this movie, I really do, but to the extent that I'd admire a fat guy running a marathon. It's trying; it's just too ill-prepared and bloated to do the job efficiently."
"orkunhak","1","31","62","17 November 2017"," My eyes were bleeding!!
","""Justice League"" is a pointless flail of expensive (yet somehow cheap-looking) CGI that no amount of tacked-on quips, or even Gadot's luminescent star power, can rescue.<br/><br/>Like Cyborg (Ray Fisher), one of its ostensible heroes, ""Justice League"" is patched together from disparate elements. Original director Zack Snyder (""Batman v. Superman"") left partway through due to a death in the family, leaving Joss Whedon (""The Avengers"") to finish up. The result? All the plodding, gray, generic action of a Snyder film with stabs of Whedonian humor that almost never feel organic. There's no sense of purpose here, not even a sense of place."

","Okay, first of all. I wasn't gonna see it in cinemas, I wanted to wait until it comes out online. But all those trailer, and the ""hype"" had me going. Turns out, it was very big disappointment. I don't know how to even start. If they want to make a movie, let it go how comics say. Because of their only hit ""Wonder Woman"", they made her the wisest, strongest, dominant character ever. It felt like more Wonder woman ft justice league than Justice league. It felt like Batman, superman and all other characters were there at the mercy of wonder woman. The way batman acts, superman acts (in comics), over here, it was all just about wonder woman. I know wonder woman is inspiring this and that, but they over did it here. I can't even take it out from my mind how bad it felt I don't think so we are ever gonna see bad-ass batman EVERY AGAIN. It's all about wonder woman now. Secondly, CGI wasn't gonna enough. Story was very predictable, nothing special, no surprises. And the Superman, wasn't exciting, somehow you already know what was gonna happen. It all just felt awful, I wanted to see bad-ass ""batman"", meaning of hope ""Superman"", the king aqua man, inspiring wonder woman etc. But this is more like, we beg you wonder woman for your mercy, please guide us, we are nothing without you, all that crap. I'm not hating on wonder woman (comics), but this is really awful. See there are many plot holes, but it would have been exciting if they did like comics, instead making it all about wonder woman because she had such a hit in DCEU. Gal Gadot is to DC like RDJ to Marvel. Just the difference is RDJ helps all other actors in MCU to rise with him, Gal Gadot makes it all about her, her and HER. After watching this, I even started hating ""Wonder Woman"" movie. Sorry DC"

","Definitely better than bvs. However, considering the triumph that was wonder woman, this is a major step down! There is so many things Justice league can't get right and that just adds to the awkwardness. Eg. A visibly old batman who lacks charisma (ben looks so uncomfortable playing bruce wayne as well), a dorky and annoying flash (I get it, hes trying to be the comic relief..just don't try too hard) as well as a style over substance aquaman. Its not all bad though, despite that is was mildly fun. Cyborg, wonder woman and superman were great! Yes...even superman. He finally smiled! The standouts definitely are cyborg and wonder woman. As for the forgotten...well let me see...oh yes! The villain! What the heck? What a lame villain. He looks like a sea shell. A mollusk. Not scary at all and he cant even enunciate properly! ""What the heck are you saying if you have a tongue use it!"" All i hear him say is ""mother"". That word never makes a villain like like a bad-ass. The story was..meh.<br/><br/>So I'll give this movie a 5.555/10. Twas pretty forgettable."

The movie lacked any depth and all dialog consisted mainly of one liners and sad attempts to get some laughs. DC simply can't match Marvel and I think that is a shame since they have such rich material to work with. I think in future I will give DC movies a miss."

","After watching the trailer, I was expecting something absolutely mind-boggling, so this was a bit of a disappointment. The entire movie felt like an introductory session into the characters of the Justice League. Steppanwolf wasn't a very formidable villain either. DC still has a long way to go and considering the big players in the DC comics world, I have hope that they will get there soon.<br/><br/>This movie made promises it couldn't keep, even though stylistically, this was still entertaining. My favorite character was Barry Allen (The Flash). Ezra Miller was really good as Allen and added the comic element in the film. His expressions were perfect and made me laugh throughout. Probably one of the only good things about this film. I also enjoyed the battle sequences and the special effects.<br/><br/>Seemed like it had a lot of potential but fell short in execution. Would have liked to see the story move further. Hopefully the upcoming movies would be better."
"joebloggscity","7","4","5","12 August 2018"," Fine enough DC universe movie, deserves more breathing space...
","I guess this is that movie that has been so easy for people to just throw pelters at it. If anything, it's been incredible the reaction against but also some of the support also. Let's be honest much of the criticism is also due to the rivalry faction of DC fans v Marvel fans, and i can't be bothered with all that.<br/><br/>Anyhow, as for this, I am much in the centre. Having only just watched the film I thought that there was actually a lot to commend it for, but yes there are some flaws. <br/><br/>Lighter in note than either ""Man of Steel"" of ""Batman V Superman"", it's more accessible. Characters are a good mixture and entertaining, and I really warmed to them. I thought Aquaman stole the show but The Flash was also excellent. Humour was good and simple. So much to like and it all keeps your attention.<br/><br/>Flaws? Well, the story could have been better and Wonder Woman actress Gal Gadot really can't act or hold the screen. The villain just wasn't strong enough but thankfully wasn't a simple copy of Marvel. The final battle was confusing, not sure how it was all resolved. Also what's the point of Lois Lane in these films? She's been terrible used, or just simply the wrong actress. Just not convinced.<br/><br/>Despite those criticisms, don't get me wrong, it's a fine enough tentpole film. Most critics have gone over the top, and personally I think it's incredible that this has taken as much flak as it has when a number of far inferior Marvel movies have been given an easy ride in comparison (e.g. Avengers 2).<br/><br/>It's a watchable and enjoyable film. Deserves more breathing space, and really it's a fine evening out. The series will evolve and improve, especially with new directors in line, so should be interesting."

","This is a fun superhero movie! I look forward to multiple viewings. Yes, the ""world-destroyimg supervillian"" is pretty standard but this main goal of this movie is introducing new heroes and the challenge of bringing the League together. On that level is works great. 
With only 2 hours there isn't too much time to give a lot of back story to Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman along with the emotional battle Superman goes through after his resurrection. We do get a good intro to the personalities and motivation of the new members with a touch of a backstory. Not too much is needed for The Flash and Aquaman with planned solo movies for them. Movie succeeds in getting rid of the ""lameness"" of Aquaman and makes him dark and cool with some real power. The Flash is great comic relief. It's not even close to being too much. Cyborg isn't nearly as well known but he gets a key role in the plot that puts him on the same level as the other new members.
Wonder Woman once again dominates the screen with her conflict whether she should show the emotional strength to lead the team. We all know Batman and Superman and Batman is great fueling the rams formation along with Superman coming to the rescue as the cleanup hitter.

","As an avid fan of both Sci-Fi and the Comic book genre, I get frustrated each time a new series comes out and he critics started to tear it apart. Even when Star Trek the Movie Hit the Screen, my father complained that the movie should have been more like the opening scene with Klingons!
Each Series has to reintroduce itself and the same was true for Justice League. While we have had introductions to Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman; this is the first time we actually start to build the story together, what they are and what they mean to each other. Couple that with the introduction of Aquaman and the Flash and there is an intricate web that needs to be told. While comic book and cartoon loyalists may have a different evaluation base their interaction with the characters; I believe that Justice league does an outstanding job of laying the foundation for the franchise.
 The possibilities about the friendship between Superman and Batman and the tension between Wonder Woman and Batman can lead to a vast number of story lines. I am eager to see where they go? There is always the what if, especially in product that means so much to so many. My pet peeves are related to the darker Aquaman and flighty Flash characters that vary from my childhood images; but, I love the story line and it lays out the ground work for a franchise that could surpass them all!"

","Sometimes I don't get all the hate on certain movies. In my opinion this film is a great debut for a group of superheroes who haven't been together on the screen yet. If the movie was made earlier (like 2012) it would have got better reviews. Yes it has some holes in the plot but all in all it is an entertaining movie. They also could have chosen a better villain, but to be honest Loki was the main antagonist of The Avengers, and he isn't the best of the bunch either. But that movie was made back then, and it was enough for ppl. Now the fans have much higher expectations :("

They need to keep away from Disney Comedy Marvel Universe and focus more on what Nolan did with the Dark Knight. This is Snyder's fault, not Whedon's.

Superman is like a Ken doll, way to much bottox.

","As soon as Justice League started advertising for release the critics started hating on in because it wasn't from the 'Color OVERLOAD' Disney OWNED marvel movie. This movie was NOT supposed to be like the Disney OWNED marvel. Wake up people! Superhero movies should reflect the comics. Justice League captured the comics. 
""IF"" warner brothers would have STAYED out of the editing of the ORIGINAL Zach Snyder version THEN this movie would have had NO critics complaining. Zach's vision on Justice League, Batman vs Superman, and Man of Steel are what real fans of comics and comic movies would call WINNERS! He has a vision of what DC movies should be and DC movies should NOT be 'COLOR OVERLOAD' like the Disney OWNED marvel. 
AFTER watching the Zach Snyder version of Batman vs Superman it was clearly the BETTER version of the movie. When warner brothers stands up to Disney and the critics and put out the CORRECT version of the Justice League part 2 then the DC movies will show the world what Comic book movies should be. 
This movie was great and entertaining from beginning to the end. The parts that were reshot with the digital mustache removed did bug me but ONLY because other online groups mentioned it. 
The Steppenwolf character was a strong character for the Justice League to face. 
Was Loki an overpowering character to face the Avengers? Answer: NO. 
Loki could not beat up all of the Avengers one by one except for Black Widow and Tony Stark (anytime that he is out of his suit).
Steppenwolf beat up Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Amazons, Atlantians. 
Wonder Woman and Aquaman is stronger than most of the Avengers. 
Stop beating up a movie because Disney owns you too like they OWN marvel (sell out), and now (after Gov. Approval) fox."

DC is a darker tone which sets them apart and for those that lamented BvS, I feel sorry for you. Justice League was what I needed. The character portrayals were spot on. I enjoyed the comedic angle from the flash but I wasn't fond of some scenes when his skills lacked, ie the prison scene. Needed more emotion. Would've personally chosen Grant Gustin for the part but oh well. Gal Gadot amazed me again with her portrayal of Wonder Woman. And was it just me or was the favorite son of Krypton really strong?

","I'm Quite disappointed after seeing the movie. I'm not going to tell you any spoilers so don't worry, it's spoiler free. First let's see whats good in this movie. The tone of the movie, action sequences and the parts which they included only because to make a fan happy is appreciative. The tone of the movie is lighter than Batman V Superman with jokes which you won't laugh because you would have seen them in the trailers. The fight scenes are really good and in that you can clearly see Zack Snyder's idea. Let's see whats not good. First of all after seeing this movie u won't get connected with the heroes unlike in Avengers u will connect with everyone and get to know about them, even though movie have some unique time for individuals.The connection is missing even in scenes, some scenes which are not needed too are included without which movie would be same. You can actually get to know while seeing the movie that two directors made this movie, because some scenes Zack wont take in that way. Second of all there is no background music in fights which make me sit and watch the action in silence. In trailer he kept the bgm, but not in the movie which didn't make ppl feel excited. Plot is not that blent, but is OK to have easy plot than the plot like BVS. Finally I didn't connect with the movie and enjoyed bcs of all this reason and think that I enjoyed Batman V Superman more. That's all you want to know before seeing this movie. My advice is go see the movie it's not that bad. Enjoy guys it's still superheroes with all the action.

","As someone who really loved Dawn of Justice, Justice League is not a visual experience that was Dawn of Justice. This is lighter much more kid friendly version. Zack Snyder is visual style can be clearly felt in most scenes but it doesn't feel like a Snyder film through and through. As we have already seen Batfleck and Gal Gadot in previous films, the stage was set Jason,Ezra and Ray. Contrary to what the critics said, I didn't feel that Cyborg sucked. He was able to communicate his predicament well enough in initial portions and went full Cyborg later. Jason Momoa being the badass was exciting and the lasso revealing the truth was funny. Ezra Miller as the rookie who needed friends has great comic timing and brought a laugh in many scenes. The Trinity of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman continued from where they left. Batman getting served with his own line was one of the best moments in the whole film. There were many good dialogues from all the characters including references and possible easter eggs. The one liners didn't feel forced either. The score gelled well with what was on the screen. But editing left lot to be desired. Overall the movie was real fun while it lasted. It could have really used more run time. Audience were left wanting for more. There were a lot of scenes that fans would drool over. Many scenes that were shown in the various trailers were not part of the theatrical cut. I feel like we now have a definitive answer on who is The Strongest Member of the League and let the debate begin on who the fastest is."

","JUSTICE LEAGUE An honest and insightful review by Navin Nambiar<br/><br/>I've waited for this movie for 16 years. Yes, 16 yearsÂ…cause that's when the Justice League animated series started airing on Cartoon Network. It was my favorite cartoon. I mean my absolute favorite cartoon. Do you get me? I'm also a fan of nostalgia and when I heard that Danny Elfman's classic Batman theme & John Williams' score from Richard Donner's Superman (1978) was going to be featured, I was over the moon. My mind was just filled with countless ideas and opportunities of how they could capitalize on those themes and conjure up some truly epic mind-boggling scenes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's where I let myself down. Those epic scenes will forever remain a figment of my imagination. SIGH.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, the story was too rushed in my opinion. The apparent WB corporate directive of keeping the movie shorter than 2hours seems to have done a lot of damage to the flow of the film. Not that 30mins more would make that big of a difference, but I can almost guarantee you that the director's cut will be slightly better. This is especially sad for me since in the comics, DC usually churn out great, very well written story lines. Here, not so much. The movie lacked any depth and all dialog consisted mainly of one liners and sad attempts to get some laughs. I don't have a problem with humor, but the humor in this movie is so forced it became cringe-worthy. Too many ""let's copy Marvel"" funnies about it.<br/><br/>If this had come out 10 years ago, it would have been pretty great, nowadays we expect more, want more, deserve more, and with this talent and all the money spent they should have produced a lot better movie.<br/><br/>So summarize, Justice League is an okayish Superhero movie. I'm gonna sell the two Hot Toys characters that I've pre-ordered. They don't deserve a place in my cabinet. I miss Christopher Nolan and his Batman Series. I'm disappointed :("

","Like many other i have waited eagerly to see the movie and truly i am not disappointed at all. Always love to see these super hero movies and their actions, adventures and supernaturalism. And it is a movie providing more than one of them. So i was so excited to see Batman,aquaman,The flash, Cyborg and my sweet prince Diana (wonder woman) all together under one umbrella. All those gadgets of batman, Raw power of cyborg and aquaman and soft , volatile touches of wonder woman...Man these are really fascinating.<br/><br/>Apart from superhero angle here are many positive side of the movie to be discussed.<br/><br/>The Plot :<br/><br/>sometimes it has been seen in the past that these movies concentrate so much in actions and special effect that they put little concentration on the plot. But this is not the case here. It has a good solid plot with a violent villain and his large team of warriors. The story has enough to give the movie a perfect concrete base.<br/><br/>The suspense :<br/><br/>There are not a lot of these as it is not a thriller. But enough to keep you at the edge of your sit while you are watching this. Many turns and twist present in the course of it to overwhelm you.<br/><br/>The Action :<br/><br/>Always the strongest X factor of these superhero movies and this one is not an exception. Those actions consisting of our favourite heroes against Steppenwolf and his army of parademons..Man i have really enjoyed them...You imagine Aquaman stabbing enemies with his Trident of neptune, Cyborg smashing them with mass power, The flash hurting them with electricity, Wonder women gal gadot destroying with gymnastic move and Batman with new Gadzets to surprise the enemies...There is all to go for.<br/><br/>The Bonding :<br/><br/>Most of the movie has shown a settled and perfect relation between batman and wonder woman to save the humanity. Batman has performed his role of a leader perfectly by keeping them like a bird's of same feather.<br/><br/>Acting :<br/><br/>You can never complaint about acting when there are Ben Affleck as batman, Gal gadot as Wonder woman and so with others.<br/><br/>Excitement :<br/><br/>Believe me the whole movie is a nutshell of excitement and pure joy.All the way to the end when boss fight occurred the movie brings much more excitement than ""Batman vs Superman.""<br/><br/>Special effect :<br/><br/>Always like to see those special effect in warner bros superheroes.Mindblowing action scenes with newer weapons and artillery is well documented by the producers.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>considering all these aspects of this actionpacked assembly of superheroes we finally can say that this is a much more admiring performance comparing the latest antecedent "" Batman vs Superman "" . It is much more satisfactory and enjoyable...Rest is the fatal attraction of our superheroes...You can not ignore them...Can you????????"

","""Justice League"" is one of the most anticipated for a lot of people. We  have all dreamed of seeing these heroes on the screen for an eternity,  and we finally have it. The DCEU hasn't had a good track record, and  it's no secret that I haven't been too kind to it myself. They're 1 for  4 in my opinion. Now...they're 1 for 5.  I went in giving it a chance. I gave it a chance. I wanted to like it.  It's the Justice League for crying out loud. But it's just not a good  movie.   Everything we hated about BvS is in this movie. They didn't listen.  They try to add some humor into the movie but it doesn't work, and it's  mostly with the Flash. It came across as forced and none of the jokes  were funny. It had some tonal issues, mostly it was a movie trying to  be dark and serious and twisted but then there are attempts at humor  that really throw the movie off its rhythm.   Steppenwolf was a lame villain, with a very generic villain plan. His  plan involves these three boxes that are portals, and he has parademons  and they try to bring about the end of the world and the Justice League  has to stop them. Did i mention beams in the sky yet? His CGI is  atrocious. For a movie with a rumored $300 million dollar budget you  would think the visual effects team would at least try to make it not  look noticeable. it was and it was really distracting. And it wasn't  just Steppenwolf. They do the slo-mo action sequences, which I haven't  been a fan of for a long time, but I understand that is Zack Snyder's  style.   I had heard about the movie being flawed, but fun. I can say I didn't  think it was fun. There were some moments Where I felt I was having fun  but then in the same scenes there was something that just took away  from that fun. Even if the movie wasn't executed properly, which it  wasn't, I wanted to have some fun, and unfortunately I didn't feel as  if I did.  There is some bad editing and cropping too. I noticed some obvious ADR  moments and a lot of the heads were cut off when it came to cropping  scenes.   Characterization is really thin, the plot is thin, there's plot holes  galore thanks to the mandated two hour runtime. This is a band of  superheroes that deserves better than what we got.  I am going to give ""Justice League"" a D+."
"paulijcalderon","5","39","82","15 November 2017"," Getting rid of past mistakes and embracing a lighter tone
","DC is cleaning up its past mistakes. This is the filmmakers going away from the gritty modern style established in ""Man of Steel"" and going back to the classic light feel reminiscent of Rich Donner's ""Superman"" from '78. If you thought ""Batman v Superman"" was disappointing, then have no fear. Joss Whedon is here to make things more.. hopeful.. Yeah, that would be word. Hopeful, lighthearted and more like the old classic superhero stories. All the bad decisions made in previous movies are now starting to get undone. And that's really good. They should have started out this way, but at least they now know what the right direction is. We owe a lot to ""Wonder Woman"" for that. Too bad the studio told them to not go over two hours with the run-time. Because that's what ultimately hurt the movie the most. There's a strange rushed feeling throughout it. Lots of new characters are introduced within a short time and before you notice you are already watching the final fight. That's the real issue here. It brushes over things quickly and you don't get much out of it. It's entertaining, but there's no weight or a good enough connection to what's going on. Everything is just decent. But, hey! This is the Justice League! It should be more than just fine... Right? Well, this is what we got. And it could have been way worse. You can watch it and not be too bothered.<br/><br/>I liked the characters. They are all performed well. Flash is the one that I think could have been a little stronger. This is an interpretation of him being awkward and an outcast. He had his moments of being somewhat too weird, but I did laugh at most of it. Aquaman didn't get enough time, but I'm fine with the direction they went with. It was fun to see the League interact. At times I forgot about the actors and just saw the comic book heroes instead. And that's a good sign. Still, this movie is messing with me with conflicting thoughts. I liked the characters and many visuals, but the story and overall pacing is rushing instead of being effective. I didn't feel the important impacts of major scenes. I wish I did. By the way, Hans Zimmer is out and Danny Elfman comes back to the genre as a composer. He re-uses his own ""Batman"" theme from the '89 film as well as using John Williams classic ""Superman"" score. It's always nice to hear these themes, but it's really distracting. It would have been better with some new original music. The action is fine, but it doesn't get that exciting. It's just watchable with little impact. The best fight is actually the one during the beginning bank heist scene. It never got that good again. In the end I'll say that it isn't bad. It's a decent popcorn movie that for once would have benefited having a longer run-time. Just so that we could feel the importance of the Justice League forming for the first time. The good news are that the future of the DCEU might be in good hands now. We'll see, but I hope so."

","First things first, it is a better film that B v Superman. But it is obvious that when writer Josh Weldon (former Marvel director for Avengers) took over directing from Zack Synder the movie changed. You can literally see when this happens in the film. It starts off like a Synder DC movie, all dark and trying too hard to take itself way too seriously, then half way through the characters start joking with each other and the movie injects some relief. But its disjointed at best. The problem with DC universe on film is Zack and the control he has. Marvel is brilliant because they have oversight and provides a big picture platform, but they let aspiring directors (lots of them) take some risk and the result is unique fun films. This movie proves DC films will never be on par with Marvel films. Wonder Woman was great, but that was obviously a fluke. The other problem is they just mashed these characters together without time to get to know them. Not worth your hard earned money to see this film. Wait to see it free on an airline, you'll thank me for it."

If you're an avid DC Comics reader, such as myself, you will notice a lot of really cool Easter eggs in this film and whatever you do, do NOT leave until ALL of the credits are done; 2 of the best post credit scenes I've seen in a comic book movie.

","If you are locked into viewing the world through the jaundiced eyes of the 'professional' reviewers, and pass on this movie, you are seriously missing out on a treat.<br/><br/>Although not quite a perfect movie, this collaboration between Snyder and Whedon ends up totally restoring the proper attitude, tone, and heroic posture of all of the DC super heroes present in this movie. Yes, I know, Wonder Woman was perfectly fine after her 'stand alone' venture, and she is equally excellent here, although she certainly does not stand as far above everyone else in this film; she remains Wonderful.<br/><br/>Some have complained about the 'obvious' switches between Snyder's ultra serious tones, and the perceived injected humor of Whedon. I say that the lighter touches are just right, and any contrast with the more darker elements, are absolutely no more jarring than the juggling between danger and planned humor that show up in every entry of the Marvel universe. Those that see them as a forced marriage in Justice League, are looking at it through prejudiced glasses. They want to see discord, so they find it. However they managed to put this film together, considering that two major but markedly different-styled directors were involved, they succeeded well beyond what the doomsayers that had already made up their minds claim.<br/><br/>Some scenes in this movie even remind me of Richard Donner's vision of America from his first Superman movie, and even though those moments are small, they are beautifully significant and welcome.<br/><br/>The climatic battle scene is not overly long and drawn out, and plays very well.<br/><br/>As I said above, it is not quite perfect, but I gave it a 10 here, because it is that close.<br/><br/>Do not listen to the naysayers, it is much better than Marvel's Avengers: Age Of Ultron, because although it has to mesh many pieces together, Justice League does not suffer the excess of attempting to jam ten pounds of stuffing into a 5 pound bag as Ultron attempted, but failed to do.<br/><br/>I will most readily be seeing this movie in the theaters again, before it's run is through."

","After all this time, the Justice League finally assembles in the big screen. For what it's worth, it's an entertaining time and worth the admission. Despite that, the film does have a good amount of issues. But the cast for the most part is great. Their banter and their performance is what really puts the whole film a float. <br/><br/>I've been a fan of the Ben Affleck casting since he was announced. I think he's the best cinematic version of Batman we've got on screen, certainly more comic accurate and more of a brute. Bruce Wayne here goes through a big change in his character and I liked seeing this whole new side of him. He's learning to work together with the other members and his dynamic with Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is nicely handled. Gadot, is great and her performance carries through since her solo film debut, but I still found some her line deliveries kinda weak. The reports are true though, she is used for some downgrading comedy regarding her attractive appearance and the Amazons do wear more revealing armor as opposed to the practical look Patty Jenkins and her design team helped shape. I'm not gonna go too deep in this, but I can definitely see why this would turn off a lot of fans and some general going audience members, especially since Wonder Woman was big step forward. <br/><br/>The new players are good for the most part. Ezra Miller's Flash for me was a tad too quippy. I found it kind of annoying and most of his jokes did not land. That's not to say I didn't chuckle here and there, but I know certain liberties should be taken when it comes to adapting source material, but I couldn't get on board with this Barry Allen. Maybe he'll grow into the Barry Allen I want to see someday. However his display of powers are quite cool to look at. <br/><br/>Jason Momoa's Aquaman worried me in the trailers. I was hoping he wouldn't be another quippy, tough guy/surfer dude character, but he turned out not to be. Well not entirely. Ray Fisher's Cyborg is a bit dry, but he's integral to the plot of the film. I think there's a lot of potential with him.<br/><br/>Now on to Superman. I think people who weren't happy about Cavill's Superman in the past will be happy now. For me, I was already a fan of Cavill's Superman, but it took them three tries and now he is the Superman I think everyone wanted to see. His return elevates the film just a bit more. He is the highlight for me and I'm really intrigued what they do with him next.<br/><br/>Now their villain Steppenwolf, it's not just a weak villain, it's a bad one. A really bad one. Super one-noted, and incredibly forgettable. I'd compare him to Malekieth from Thor: The Dark World. To be fair he wasn't complex in the comics either but, Snyder and his team had the opportunity to really bring something cool to the table. It is very much similar to Marvel's villain problem, and to be honest, DC villains have been extremely weak aside from General Zod. Also the Parademons are fodder. Since Avengers and Age of Ultron, it can get pretty redundant at this point to see a team take out mindless creatures. <br/><br/>The movie is brisk. It's just about two hours, and the banter between the heroes are fun. However you can probably tell that a good chunk of the film is missing in the cutting room floor. There are a lot of scenes where the scene is abrupt and the editing is very choppy. Sometimes whenever something interesting happens it just keeps cutting away instead of letting the scene play out. Corporate meddling definitely took place, which is a shame cause I would have loved to soak up the scenes a bit more. <br/><br/>I will admit the tone shift from BvS made this film feel a little Marvel-ish, not in a bad way. For me I never had a problem of the darker tone. BvS had a lot of good ideas, but it was all just sloppy execution(The Ultimate Cut is a little better). I would rank this third on the list of all the DC films that have been release. Man of Steel and Wonder Woman are better, but Justice League is a step up from BvS, and leaps and bounds better than Suicide Squad. <br/><br/>Despite some problems I'm happy Snyder pulled it off, and I wish him well especially since the family tragedy we went through. At times the film looks and feels like a Snyder film, but there are moments where you can absolutely tell Joss Whedon had his fingerprints here and there. For better or worse I thought it worked at times, and at times it didn't, most of it came from Flash, so take that for what it is. I'm not one who's really picky about CGI but there are times in the film where it's so obvious that everything is CGI. <br/><br/>To cap it off, Justice League is a flawed, but solid entry to the franchise. I'm excited now and more hopeful. Whether or not this film gets praise or negative reception, the excuse of ""it's made for the fans,"" cannot be a way to dismiss bad reviews, that goes for ANY movie. <br/><br/>So to end this review, I hope all the fanboys are just at peace with each other, whether you're Marvel or DC. In the end all we need, at the very least is a decent and entertaining film. Just cause someone else has one opinion doesn't mean it's the end all be all. <br/><br/>6.7/10"

"Jared_Andrews","3","11","19","26 February 2018"," The Team of Heroes Deserves a Better Villain
","If there were a real fight between Marvel and DC superhero movies, the referee would have stopped it a long time ago. Alas, this is not a one vs. one bout-both can continue to win. DC movies continue to make money (somehow). So once again we watch another dreary Zack Snyder landscape in a movie that looks inappropriately gloomy for one that includes people who fly. <br/><br/> Mercifully, Justice League is better than a few recent DC movie disasters, such as Suicide Squad and Batman vs. Superman. It still falls far short of the exceptional Wonderwoman, but in relative DC terms it feels like a win. 
Part of that comes from actual genuine efforts to have fun. This movie has jokes. Sure, not all of them are funny, but at least one of the filmmakers (likely Joss Whedon) is trying to sprinkle in some joy. <br/><br/> Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller) shoots his shot. He may truly be funny. It's just hard to tell because so many of his lines are not. He delivers them earnestly and with proper comic timing, but he's not quite a comedy giant who can will subpar material to hilarious levels by sheer force of charisma. That's not a knock against him. Few actors ever have possessed such talents. <br/><br/>I only wish his co-stars on screen put in half his effort. Gal Gadot was fine, not sparkling like she was in Wonderwoman but fine. To the other superhero stars-I'm not at all impressed. You can do better. <br/><br/>Perhaps they lost their energy after reading the script, which is littered with hacky dialogue and boring, predictable plot points. Something happens at some point, but it doesn't go well so the team seeks help from someone to calm down the other someone (that's my anti-spoiler phrasing). This entire sequence of something could be considered a surprise but only if you have never seen another movie before. If that is the case, welcome to movies. Many of them are much better than this one.<br/><br/>The greatest flaw in the movie-and I know I'm burying the lead here-is that the villain is awful. Steppenwolf is the least complicated, least interesting villain in recent memory. He wants to acquire power because he wants to be powerful. There's nothing deeper or more complicated than that. The most interesting thing about him-he's tall. Cool. <br/><br/> That is essentially his only defining trait. No, wait. I forgot that he also carries an axe. That may be interesting to someone. The point is that he's about as deep as a raindrop, and an entire team of superheroes deserves a more compelling adversary.<br/><br/>Stay with me, just two more nitpicks. <br/><br/>One, I cannot stand seeing Amy Adams this tragically underutilized. She's a treasure, and this movie pays her a tremendous disservice. Two, this is second recent DC movie to blatantly exploit the most attractive female character's butt. For real, there are so many butt shots of Gal Gadot in this movie that it almost seems like certain scenes were filmed by a horny teenager. <br/><br/>If you're a DC diehard or pathological fan of superhero movies (my group meets every other Thursday), you can see this movie and not completely hate it. Otherwise, I recommend giving this a hard pass. Instead, go see Black Panther. It's 1000x times better."

"inquiringminds","8","16","30","16 November 2017"," Justice League brings it home!!!
","Don't fret about Rotten Tomatoes grossly bad scoring system or believe the bad reviews from the critics that panned it. They have done a grave InJustice (yes, I meant to write that) to this film. It's fun, funny where it should be, has lots of great action & battle scenes, & gives us 3 great new additions to the league, The Flash, Aquaman, & Cyborg. Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, & Ray Fisher are fantastic as the newcomers to the team. I loved it, it's way better than Batman V Superman, & I can't wait to see it again tomorrow. I know I'll be seeing it multiple times at the theater as well as buying the Blu Ray when it's released. My biggest complaint is the Runtime is too short at 110 minutes, with 10 minutes of credits. I think the movie would be better had they left in about 15 to 20 minutes of obviously deleted scenes. It also has 2 excellent end credit scenes, the 2nd one is at the very end, so make sure & stay for that one."

"prashantbhat","10","10","17","18 November 2017"," DC has beat Marvel in this one...
","Being a 90's kid, this movie has revived nostalgia of the Justice League animation series. Beautiful execution from the start of the movie, Batman's crime fighting technique to Flash's eccentricity. Before the release of the movie I had feared about the execution of the story line, but the way they have handled is worth watching.<br/><br/>Batman's depiction in thus movie has changed a lot from the BvS version which I kind of was uncomfortable with, but throughout the movie I found justice done. Wonder Woman as usual gave a wonderful performance with all the qualities of a leader in the group, also loved the way she smiled during the para demon fight scene she is the binding force in the team. <br/><br/>Now coming to the exciting part of the film, Flash introduction- Ezra Miller as Barry Allen was fantastic the way he introduced eccentricity into the character was amazing, seriously after seeing Ezra as the Flash, I wish he could have been introduced earlier into the Flash series as the Flash. The way he has grasped the character from Flash's fast metabolism to the connection with the speed force is tremendous. Aquaman- The wildness he has bought into the character is amazing, loved the way he just has amazing chemistry with the team. The yelling and screaming in the movie just bought in positivity into the film.<br/><br/>Coming to Cyborg- The writers have bought in all the ingredients for the character from animation movies of Justice League, he is the one with all information which provides an advantage for the whole team. The way he just clinges on to information and data is amazing, for instance the way he remembers for the change engine and brings in the Mother box to the team, which ultimately is decoded by Batman to bring our favorite character Superman back to life which is executed perfectly by The Flash.<br/><br/>The way they have depicted Steppenwolf is rightful in nature, the entrance through boom tubes and the way the boom tubes activate themselves when the Steppenwolf loses is too much perfection as per animation standards.<br/><br/>In whole the movie was full of entertainment and the audience did not get bored at any moment of the film. I just don't care for critics rating for the movie because they will never understand the depiction of DC heroes. Movies are made for entertainment and this is just pure entertainment. DC have really given Marvel a tough competition through this movie, with Avengers infinity war about to release next year Marvel will have to up their ante to entertain audience. <br/><br/>Thank you DC for such a stunning piece of product and keep making such live action movies. 😍"
"SAMTHEBESTEST","6","10","17","16 November 2017"," This Above Average film by DCEU has got Enough Explosion to be called a Safe film.
","JUSTICE LEAGUE REVIEW : It was one of the Most Awaited flick for me during pre release period but later Critics reviews declared it an Average to Below Average film and i lost all that year built excitement in minutes. Let me say it straight, i'm not reviewing a Great film, i'm talking about Average film so if you see any soft corner about any field then that means Average one not even Good.<br/><br/>Justice League starts very slowly, looks like a bore flick for first 35-40 minutes and then picks up smartly. Later it continues the flow but after every explosive and entertaining scene there're 1 or 2 minutes loo breaks followed. Don't know why it happens, why film gets slow for few moments when screenplay was in top form? Then enough explosion at the end and later one surprising factor after end credits saves this Average flick to look an Above Average stuff. We've seen Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman in prequel and i'm glad to welcome 3 new guys in the team, Aquaman is Good, Flash is too good, Cyborg is decent. Some musical scenes feels irritating. Runtime is shorter than 2 hours and thanks to the editor for that but how could he trim that Superman's re-entry scene from Trailer (Alfraid says, Let's Hope you're not too late) ? Superman's Returning is slightly curved towards emotional bonding but it doesn't work at all. Villain is powerful but a fairy tale and retro look doesn't impress much. Visual Effects are Brilliant, could have been better for 3D viewing. Direction is messy, Snyder either needs to improve or needs to be removed from DCEU. We're waiting for One Good film from him and we're still waiting. Thanks to Jenskine for that one good film Wonder Woman otherwise Snyder has almost finished DCEU. Why he always go for a Dark film, why can't he just go for some fun and light moments like Marvel? <br/><br/>Overall, Justice League is an Above Average film, obviously not that bad as critics said. Chuck the critics and go for it, those who liked BvS will surely like this and those who did not like BvS will also find it an Average One Time Watch. Enough Explosion and action in middle and at the End makes this one to worth your ticket Purchase. Talking about Box Office this one should do decent business in the range of previous 2 DCEU films or might even struggle to reach there while $1 Billion club is out of reach. I'm going with 6/10* and hoping for better a sequel which will have a League of Villains (This might be a spoiler)."
"superherofacts","6","10","17","16 November 2017"," Just fine. A movie that takes plot over story.
","I️ thought this movie was just sub-par nothing out of the water. To avoid getting the wrong impression first off I'll say I'm quite a big fan of DC comics grew up on the JLA animated series and still to this day I️ read their comics from time to time. Getting that out the way I️ was rather looking forward to visiting the cinema for this. However I️ was not going in expecting something that would paramount the medium that is film but rather just with the idea of hoping something riveting. In the end the movie has many recurring issues that have been prevalent through this connected universe. Before getting to that though, this movie does have a few positive things to note of. One being it has it's way with the audience unlike much of the previous films in this cinematic universe (except WW) it's entertaining and enjoyable at times with a much more light-hearted and ebullient, mainly because of the great cast which definitely supports the film. All the actors are great as a collective part and they also decided to do Superman right which leads to probably my favorite scene in the film Once he's brought back to life he's oblivious and unable to recognize anyone so he takes on the entire JL on his own which which instantly reminds me of the comics and the JLA Series itself and at the same time showing us how capable he is in this set universe. Even the Flash's character is very faithful to the one we've come to love in the comics and the animated series, someone who is fond of making one too many jokes and is often seen to be rather obnoxious. I️ even once or twice found find myself smiling or laughing which is something to look at when bringing up this film in comparison to the others that have previously come out in the DCEU. But now with that being said the positives in this film often hide and attempt to make the flaws and holes in the film not as noticeable. It isn't to say the attempt to make things more gleeful and light-hearted is wrong but it's misleading. This film is rushed from the start and never fully takes its time to develop and explain the characters which isn't as noticeable because of what I️ mentioned earlier. However it is easy for me at least to let this pass because as a someone who knows all these characters and understand all their backstories and how they came to be I️ kind of have it filled in for myself. But on the other side of the coin their is the casual movie goer to which I️ would consider myself as a movie goer and someone who appreciates the medium that is film. The casual movie goer isn't always aware of all these things and neither should they be entitled to knowing all these things in all honesty. And then from there we are quickly rushed into some exposition and a means of gather the group to prevent the big bad of the film ""Steppenwolf"" from getting the mother boxes. To which I️ add has zero personality and is completely a throwaway villain whom we will completely forget about. Which adds to this feeling of the film feeling rushed and it leads to the films big predictable ending to which most superhero movies use. Also the way the movie was edited and cut you can acutely see that this was messed with during post production and the movie often feels like two separate movies at times, one being Joss Weadon's Justice League the other Zach Snyder's Justice League. There isn't any balance although the more light hearted hopefully ideals come through much more in the film since they brought Joss Weadon on who found great success in doing so with Marvel. The movie often see itself joking around and poking at things but then demands itself to be taken more seriously at times which isn't wrong but it's something that only works when earned. It comes with developing characters and trying to make a story that we can all can remember 20 years from now. To conclude this I️ must say I️ went in with a open positive mind rather than looking back and seeing what has come to be a rather disappointing setup for a cinematic franchise at times and I️ got more than what I️ expected. But it ultimately underachieves at creating a riveting story with memorable characters and focuses more on its plot which is far too generic and predictable to ever be remembered."

I enjoyed the fight. I wish the fight between Superman and Steppenwolf was longer. Superman looked more OP in here. Then again, he is Man of Steel.

The Flash was very good as well, gave us some good comedic moments that made some cheesy parts of the film a bit more bearable.

First, Batman doesn't let the criminals go, I hope this is clear. Second, The Flash doesn't make retarded jokes, he is someone who believes in the cause and takes his job seriously. I hope he will be developed better in the next movies. Third, who's Aquaman? Cause after I left the screening, about his character, I knew as much as I knew before the movie. Fortunately, Wonder Woman is so hot that I can't really complain about her and Cyborg is actually the only one that I can save out of all of them. I really don't wanna say anything about Steppenwolf cause the para-demons are characterised more than him, in this movie. A few editing mistakes. Gigantic plot holes like the flowers that appear from nowhere towards the end of the picture and the 3/4 scenes dedicated to a completely useless Russian family who have the same function of Commissioner Gordon in this movie: No function at all.

"JustinFrederic","7","5","7","18 November 2017"," Enjoyable as an experience, yet wildly erratic and disenchanting as a film
","After years of anticipation from longtime DC Comics fans and newcomer fans of the DC Cinematic Universe alike, Justice League has finally arrived.<br/><br/>Before I delve into what I liked and disliked about the film, I feel that is important to note that I am one of the few out there who loves the entire DC Cinematic Universe. In my opinion, both 2013's Man of Steel and 2016's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, both directed by Zack Snyder, are vastly underrated films, especially the latter. I will admit that 2016's Suicide Squad was a disappointment, but I soon forgot about this because I was very pleased that Wonder Woman got the critical reception that it so deserved.<br/><br/>With that being said, here are my thoughts on Justice League.<br/><br/>The film opens with the world dealing with the aftermath of the death of Superman, which occurred at the end of Batman v Superman. Bruce Wayne/Batman (played by Ben Affleck) realizes that he has to assemble a team of individuals with special powers, along with Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), in order to fill the massive protective void that Superman left behind, and to stop Steppenwolf (the highly polarizing entirely-CGI villain of the film) from returning the world to the dark ages.<br/><br/>Justice League has a far more simplistic plot than previous DC Cinematic Universe entities. This positively affects the film because it can attract a wider viewing audience (and perhaps win back the people who were turned off from Batman v Superman's more complex plot), which is exactly what executives at Warner Brothers likely want. However, the simpler plot leads to a far shorter running time than many expected, given the lengths of Snyder's previous DC films.<br/><br/>There were many key moments in the film that felt choppy and rushed. I won't give anything away, but there was one scene which would have been a perfect opportunity for an emotional moment in the film, and yet it is on screen for no longer than about 30 seconds. Character introductions, especially to newcomers such as The Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman, felt very rushed and the film jumped back and forth between them all in the first act. The original cut of Justice League clocked in at about three hours long. However, it was reported that Warner Brothers demanded that the film's running time did not exceed two hours. This is unfortunate because I feel that the film would have been improved if it were at least twenty minutes or so longer. Hopefully an extended cut will be released on home media.<br/><br/>The acting from Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Henry Cavill, as well as the newcomers Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, and Ray Fisher, was excellent. Gadot truly owns the role of Wonder Woman, as does Cavill and Affleck for Superman and Batman, respectively. While it's an unpopular opinion, I've always admired Affleck's portrayal of the Caped Crusader. When I first heard of the controversial use of a CGI villain, I came into the film with low expectations for Steppenwolf. However, I did not find him to be a major issue for the movie. Was he an amazing villain? Hardly. Was he a terrible villain? No. Steppenwolf was just fine. Nothing more, nothing less. The rest of the visual effects in the film were fairly well done. Though for a film with a $300 million budget, there were many special effect shots that could have been fine tuned. The action sequences were enjoyable and thrilling, though they did feel like they went on for a bit too long at times.<br/><br/>Justice League has a light tone – which can feel inconsistent from the other films in the franchise. I feel that given the mixed reception that Man of Steel and Batman v Superman received, a lighter tone for the film was inevitable. For individuals like myself who loved Snyder's dark and gritty entities, this was a bit of a letdown. I felt no real emotional weight or connection to the story as it went along; I felt completely removed from the emotional impact of what was happening on screen. This did not make me have a less good of a time (perhaps it did the opposite in fact), but it still felt like a letdown to me, given how much I enjoyed how different previous entries in the franchise were in terms of their tone.<br/><br/>While it may seem not worth noting for some, the limited to virtually absent use of Hans Zimmer's themes from previous films in the DC Cinematic Universe was a major disappointment. Danny Elfman's score works just fine, but not using Zimmer's themes for Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman at key moments of the film truly diminished scenes that were supposed to be powerful, but were already hurt by the constraints placed on them due to the reduced running time.<br/><br/>There were many aspects that I loved about Justice League. A combination of the acting, the simplistic yet enjoyable plot and the action sequences made for a highly enjoyable time at the cinema, especially in the IMAX format in which I watched the film. However, the shortened running time, lack of character development, an inconsistent tone and lack of use of Zimmer's themes from the rest of the DC Cinematic Universe majorly diminished what Justice League could have been.<br/><br/>Overall, Justice League is enjoyable as an experience, yet wildly erratic and disenchanting as a film."
"FallenEye","6","5","7","18 November 2017"," Minor League.
","There is always so much to say when it comes to the DCEU. You want to be honest, but also exhibit to the die-hard fans that you're not the villain, especially because, many of us, would love to also see the DC franchise soar.<br/><br/>There is always risk. Infinity War for instance, runs the major risk of being a complete failure, because it has generated anticipation that spans an entire 10 years, a whole decade; so the delivery needs to meet expectations that have been multiplying and amplifying, and that will prove without question, to be one hell of a mountain to climb.<br/><br/>With Justice League, well, it ran the undeniable risk of being compared to Marvel's 2012 Avengers Assemble, and possibly not being up to the task. Justice League ran the risk of not being the first to ""do it"", and so, if they can't be the first, they can damn sure perhaps, be the best.<br/><br/>There is a rivalry here, hopefully healthy. Hate it or love it, the best way to really judge Justice League, is to compare it directly to Avengers Assemble, and sadly, it is a distant 2nd.<br/><br/>For example; because of BvS: Dawn of Justice, Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman all had already met, so, the excitement of them meeting for the very first time, and also in the very first actual DC team- up extravaganza, that goosebumps inducing moment was dead in the water long before Aquaman could breathe life into its lungs.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Loki, even without comparison, was an amazing villain to watch, and Tom Hiddleston brought him to life excellently. Steppenwolf, was just okay. The CGI on Cyborg was, suspect and the CGI on the Parademons was brutal. Flash's armour wasn't the best either, but, with that one, we understand why. The first act of the movie was Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman's backstory and motive, which was way too much story to fit in, thus it felt a bit incomplete and without that juice, to mention a few.<br/><br/>Watching Justice League, and seeing with my own two eyes that for the first time ever, this union is in fact happening was amazing, but, the film itself, could've been so much more.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot was gorgeous as usual, Flash was on and off, Affleck was, Affleck, and Cavill's Superman was truly awesome actually, but the ones who stole the show were Jeremy Irons and Jason Momoa. They probably fall within the characters who received the least screen time, but, like those ""3 minutes"", Jason especially, made it count.<br/><br/>The League vs Superman fight was stunning, and what Superman said to Batman was just so truly, piercing... I absolutely loved it. That entire sequence/scene is hands down, the best in the movie. The energy it had, was enough to have been the one to bring Superman back to life... And honestly, it did.<br/><br/>Justice League isn't bad, entirely, but, it's definitely not in The Major Leagues. I'll say it again, DC has such incredible characters, but Warner Bros. aren't doing them, True Justice. 6.2/10."
"kjproulx","6","22","44","17 November 2017"," Does It Really Do The Franchise Justice?
","Whether or not you feel like arguing for DC or Marvel, a good movie is a good movie, regardless of who made it. The terms 'fun' and 'dark' are the two that get tossed around the most when comparing these two franchises, and while many people are wrong to like a movie based on its tone, I can gladly say that not much complaining can be done about the tone of Justice League. Meshing light and dark to form a solid mixture of the two, due to some unfortunate circumstances behind the scenes, may have actually made this a better film than it originally was, but who really knows. As I said, the tone of this film is great in my opinion, but the movie itself is quite the mixed bag. There is a lot of fun to be had with Justice League, but here is a weighing of the pros and cons of this highly anticipated addition to the DC Universe of films.<br/><br/>The premise is quite simple. An evil force in Steppenwolf has arrived and needs to find three so-called mother boxes in order to take over the world. Using what little backstory that Bruce Wayne has on many super-powered people, he, along with the help of Diana, form a team to take him down. With the hope that Superman may also return, this team must do everything they can to hopefully save the day. Although these characters are all a joy to see interacting with each other, herein lies the biggest issues with the film as a whole.<br/><br/>There isn't much to say about the villain here because his storyline is almost too simple to even want to describe. He's a generic bad guy that wants to take over the world, who really only exists in order to make this team feel the need to band together and save the world. When a villain is just a tool for a team to exist, the overall impact of your movie won't ever reach a high point. That being said, even though the villain ruins the entire film for me every time he's on-screen, the characters surrounding him and how they all come together was really the highlight of the movie, making the price of admission worth it.<br/><br/>No, characters like Cyborg, Aquaman, and The Flash aren't given quite enough backstory to really feel for them, but the casting of them is terrific and the little screen time they're given is fantastic. Their interaction with one another was great and I can't wait to see more of them in the future. There's honestly nowhere to go but up from this messy installation.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot once again bring everything they have to the table and they sure seem to be making these characters their own, so I really hope they stick with this franchise for at least a few more years, because I feel as though there are some entertaining stories to be told if the post-credits sequences have anything to say about it.<br/><br/>Many people will be going into this film hoping for some exciting Superman action, and although I won't give anything away for fans, I'll simply state that his small presence is more than worth the wait. Like in Man of Steel, his character, along with Lois Lane and his mother Martha definitely adds some great emotion to certain elements of the film. In terms of entertainment, this movie held my interest from start to finish and I'm actually looking forward to seeing the future progression of these characters after these first rocky few films. I like these characters a lot. They just deserve better films.<br/><br/>In the end, comic book fans will have their share of shrieks throughout the film, from cameos to world-building, but it really just comes down to whether or not this is a good movie for the majority of audiences to flock out and see. Upon reflection, I enjoyed much more about this film than I disliked, so I would warrant a recommendation, but only to those who've followed each installment since Man of Steel, because not knowing who certain characters are would be a detriment to your experience.<br/><br/>The movie feels very rushed, but there are great character moments to make up for that. Even though there is some very obvious CGI work throughout the film, the action is exciting and a joy to see on the big screen. Even though the villain is terrible, the team is a blast to see interacting on-screen. I seem to be finding a pro for every con, but it just comes down to whether or not I had a good time, and that's a pretty definitive yes. Justice League is a mess, but it's a mess I had fun with and that shows promise for the future. I enjoyed myself for the most part."

","The huge ensemble of characters makes the movie entertaining with actors like Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller and Jeremy Irons with lots of other great actors it's entertaining and re-watchable as I'm such a fan of the characters and DC but it isn't a perfect movie, it's far from perfect thanks to it being left unfinished with the final product being a movie with two visions, Zack Snyder should have finished it, may his daughter rest in peace. Joss Whedon tried to finish it but failed but succeeded in making it light hearted, funny and possibly other things but he really did cut too much scenes. Let's put the negative aside. The villain, Steppenwolf which is played by Ciaran Hinds works perfect as rushing Darkseid too fast is something I disliked with Justice League: War, the animated movie. The visual effects are stunning to look at, the moustache removal was decent. The costumes are on point, just fine and realistic.
At first I didn't like The Flash in this as I had only seen the TV Show but I was wrong, after reading the comics and watching this again I like him a lot. The character development for the character will be so great to see in future The Flash movies if they make one! How all the heroes use their abilities and equipment flows so well, makes for some great action sequences!<br/><br/>With all that said, I have to say I find it a good superhero movie, it gets the hero aspect right and it just feels good watching it as I really like the characters."

I think a lot of the negative reviews are coming from some Marvel fans that only like Marvel. I never go out and bash the Avenger movies even though they are so childish. Some are not but here lately. Plus Marvel puts out about 15 movies to DC's 1. I am surprised that people have not gotten sick of them. Seems like they have 15 movies for each of their heroes. I have to be honest and say that I loved the Dark Knight trilogy so much I was even hesitant to jump on the Justice League bandwagon. Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale made 3 classics. Batman movies that will be talked about 50 years from now. Do you think they will be talking about the Avenger movies in 50 years. So I hope they keep making the Justice League movies.

","So DC holds the two biggest superheroes in the World (Superman/Batman) so why are they getting so thoroughly dismantled by Marvel? Why is their universe simply not working?<br/><br/>I think there are a number of reasons but the primary one is that they are using a failing formula. Look at Marvel, they established each character with their own movie(s), they did a slow build in creating their universe and introduced the characters to one another over time.<br/><br/>DC however didn't, they did a couple of Superman movies, Wonder Woman, the messy Batman vs Superman and the barely connected to the DC Universe (At that time) Suicide Squad. And then like that boom Justice League without establishing Aquaman, Cyborg or Flash. <br/><br/>I'm rooting for DC don't get me wrong but at this stage it'll take something special to turn things around.

"lawrencelentz","10","9","15","18 November 2017"," Had this come out when the Avengers did, it would be worshiped
","First things first, this is not a movie without flaws. My rating, however, is based on MY OWN predetermined view of what THIS film should and should not be. With that in mind, despite the numerous trials and tribulations that it faced in its production (switching directors at a late stage in its post-production, regardless of who took the helm and their previous work, will always result in a slightly less coherent film) this is still a perfectly watchable film with moments of genuine hilarity, emotion and intensity. Personally I am sad that we will never get to see the version of this film envisaged by Zack Snyder, as Whedon's input is definitely noticeable. Nevertheless, the result is a family friendly superhero flick, which is what Warner Bros. and Snyder and co were seeking in the first place. For me this is a 10/10. I understand why the critics might bash it, as they are reviewing it against THEIR OWN predetermined criteria, however I just hope that fan love for this franchise shines through the negativity and keeps the so called DCEU alive. <br/><br/>Regarding the cast, Affleck is Batman, and while he does not have the same intensity as in Batman v Superman (something which I loved) he is more than qualified to deliver in these films. Gal Gadot: nothing needs to be said for her, stunning and impactful as we all know her to be. Ray Fisher makes an excellent Cyborg, delivering the emotional turmoil through which he suffers and the brighter moments perfectly. Jason Momoa: well lets just say it's going to be a long wait for his solo Aquaman outing, he's a force of nature. Ezra Miller is the Flash, I'll leave that at that. Last, but certainly not least, Henry Cavill has delivered the ultimate modern day Superman. While he too faced a share of difficulties in the additional photography, not least because of his contractual obligations to Paramount, he manages to steal the scenes he is in and it provides a great conclusion to the character arc started in 2011 with Man of Steel.<br/><br/>What it comes down to IS whether we fans choose to see all that is good with the DCEU, as opposed to drowning in the negativity of others who purely want to bash the film. As the film itself shows, we can strive to be better - and as fans we should."
"Gordon-11","Null","9","15","16 November 2017"," Not as good as I hoped
","This film tells the story of Batman and Wonder Woman putting a team together to fight against evil forces who try to bring the fragments of the mother box back together.<br/><br/>The visual effects are very impressive, and the story is very fast paced. In fact, it is so fast that it sacrifices the story telling. The main backbone of the story is there, but there's no cohesion, engagement and no captivation. The plethora of characters also mean that each of them get little screen time, hence there's little developer of characters. I thought I was just being fed some fragmented scenes. The socially awkward young guy tries too hard to provide comedic relief, that it makes the heroic efforts of the league less credible. Unfortunately I did not enjoy this film as much as I thought I would."

DCs films - Suicide Squad etc - are so overwhelmingly removed from their compelling comic-book source material it's a crime. Zack Snyder needs to be removed from this franchise immediately and permanently, he has no grasp whatsoever of what made the comics so brilliant and fails each and every time in translating the electrifying vibe of the comics into great cinema. Marvel's films succeed in staying one step ahead. Marvel is clever, punchy, sassy, exciting, engaging. The freeway chase in Civil War was stunning. The fight scenes involving Black Panther re-invented fight scenes and pushed them to a new level. Justice League however is a tedious, mindless bunch of CGI puke. I'm not going to waste any more time on this abysmal mess of a film other than recommending the public avoid Justice League and DC abandon their cinema agenda and re-focus on writing comics. The DC Extended Universe is not an extended universe, it's a black hole, sucking dry the essence of humanity."
"fernandoschiavi","7","8","13","3 May 2020"," Justice League is not the perfect movie, but it is a light of hope in the DC universe
","With the proper presentation of the DC Holy Trinity in previous films, it is time for the first DC Comics Justice League meeting. The formation of the team has undergone some changes over the years, but for this film version we have the meeting of Superman, Batman, Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Flash and the Cyborg. In 'Batman v Superman', in addition to the Holy Trinity which had a much greater prominence, we quickly glimpsed Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg, indicating that this would be the team of this first version of the League in theaters.
Once again, who heads this meeting is Zack Snyder, one of the main creative minds in Warner's latest films. This time, the script is under the responsibility of Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon. Interestingly, Whedon was primarily responsible for adapting the first two meetings of the Avengers for cinemas, a rival publisher of DC. The invitation for the screenwriter / director to stay with one of those responsible for the script had a clear objective: to try to make the story a little less obscure and with more humor, in addition to having the artist's ability to integrate different worlds into a unique and cohesive.
In Justice League, Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) assemble a team of superheroes composed of Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) to face the catastrophic threat of SteppeWolf (voice of Ciarán Hinds) and his army of Parademons that try to conquer and remake the Earth through the combined energies of the Maternal Boxes, which are separated and hidden in places around the world.
The beginning of the film shows a world that has lost hope and is still shaken by Superman's death. People have created memorials for the superhero and his memory is everywhere. Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane) continue to keep in touch, but still suffer from the loss of Clark and have difficulty moving forward. In the midst of this, Batman investigates the rise of Parademons. Batman tries to deal with the guilt of Superman's death, while constantly dealing with his own mortality and humanity in a team of superheroes. Feeling that a greater evil is about to appear at any moment, he needs to contact Diana Prince, who continues to defend people and fight for justice, to meet with other metahumans like Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman to face an evil bigger.
The first twenty minutes are dedicated to showing a little more about these last two and the recruitment of both for the Justice League. If Barry Allen, the Flash, accepts right away, enthusiastic. The little thing shown about Flash is that he keeps moving and does not stop at any job, that his father is in prison for killing his mother, but that he has always defended his innocence. Unfortunately, this question is not addressed during the film and the scenes only serve to situate the character to the audience. Victor Stone (Cyborg) has a great IQ, had a football scholarship at the University of Gotham and was considered dead after an accident in which he participated with his father, leaving his body modified like a machine. He is recruited by Wonder Woman. Arthur Curry, Aquaman, who wants some peace of mind and refuses Bruce Wayne's first contact. He only joined the team after Atlantis suffered an attack and made him realize that something more dangerous was about to happen. There is also no further explanation of his past, perhaps why an upcoming adaptation of Aquaman is right, which will tell his story in more detail.<br/><br/>Unlike the Marvel Avengers, in which almost all of the main characters had solo films before the team meeting in the first Avengers film, here the script has to waste time introducing three main characters from the team. The script, unfortunately, ends up showing them in a superficial and generic way, as if it were an obligation before inserting them in the battles with the Holy Trinity. In this respect, Warner / DC lacks a little more care when dealing with characters from its main group. It is necessary for the public to care, create bonds with those superheroes who are willing to sacrifice there to save the Earth. The only one that does better in this task is Flash, the main comic relief of the film, responsible for practically all the moments of humor in the film, and there were even a few. Aquaman also carries a charisma and presence of scene that set the stage well for his solo film. Cyborg, due to the accident, is still in a phase of denial and does not see his powers as a gift, but as a disgrace that ended his life. Only gradually does he realize that he can be useful against something greater.
The Justice League members' first team collaboration was at an abandoned facility in the Port of Gotham, where they face off against enemies looking to find out where the Maternal box kept with the men was. These are breathtaking scenes in the underground, including the powerful Nightcrawler, another toy created by Batman. However, they feel they need Superman's help to defeat the enemy and devise a plan to resurrect him using one of the Maternal Boxes. Halfway through the film, we see this plan in action and the consequences of Superman's return. This was an expected moment, after all, the Justice League without Superman is totally uncharacterized. The question was how they would get him to return and the solution found until it is consistent with the plot and does not sound so appealing. Too bad that after meeting his great loves, Superman soon has to return to active duty to help save the world once again. The Man of Steel, who has always been a problematic hero, since the fact that he is practically unbeatable harms the creation of threatening situations, here it appears in an imposing way. The hero's return is one of the highest points of the production.
Unlike previous films that did not know how to balance the action so well with the development of the characters, this one does a little better on the mission. Snyder does well in what he knows how to do better again, that is, the creation of striking images, whether in the scenes where Batman appears in the shadows in his intimidating poses or even in the creative battle scenes. This time, we have good scenes scattered throughout the projection, with special emphasis on the scene in which Diana saves people from a group of reactionary terrorists, or even the entire sequence of the reappearance of the Steppe Wolf on the Paradise Island of Amazonas. Once again, the Amazons show their value, their courage and render great action scenes against the Steppe Wolf and his Parademons. Even flashbacks showing the unity of a unified army that included Olympic Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, humans and Green Lanterns that offered the Steppe Wolf the first defeat in the past. We must also highlight the scenes of the theft of one of the Maternity Boxes in Atlantis, introducing us to that underwater world for the first time, even if for a short time and the final climax of the village in Russia, when the entire League gathers to try to defeat the threat of the Wolf of the Steppe. Unfortunately, this last act is all shot on green screen and the artificiality of the scenes gets to bother, despite the visual being quite interesting as a whole.<br/><br/>It is worth mentioning the good photography work by Fabian Wagner and the production designer by Patrick Tatopoulos. Composer Danny Elfman returns to work on a DC film 25 years after Batman: Return. He does a really interesting job, mainly for putting together his score for Batman, Rupert Gregson-Williams for Wonder Woman, and John Williams' classic theme for Superman.
One of the biggest problems of the 'League' is an extremely convenient script, where everything is easily conquered, if the question is to convince Ciborg, this happens in a common way, if the group has to go after Superman's body, it comes without difficulties , and so on, as if nothing defied those heroes. Justice League surrenders to very poorly thought out crutches, such as a series of expository dialogues, some flashbacks and a huge number of catch phrases, in a search for easy acceptance by its audience.
The film is visually compelling, but it fails to treat some of its characters in a shallow way. Following a little of the Marvel formula in the presence of Joss Whedon in the script, there is more room for humor and scenes that are a little clearer and less dark at different times. And making the movie fun at one time or another does not erase bad narrative development. Something that still has a problematic performance by Ezra Miller that always seems in a different tone than the rest of the film. Or Ben Affleck's non-existent comic timing, transforming Batman Vs Superman's stern Batman into something a little lighter. Incidentally, Whedon is one of the film's screenwriters and also directed part of the filming, after Zack Snyder left because of a personal tragedy. The director's credit, however, goes only to Snyder, while Whedon shares the script with Chris Terrio. In fact, Snyder's absence in the final stage of post-production is felt. Known for composing great action scenes and possessing a rare skill with this segment, the director seems not to be there to avoid bad moments of computer graphics (removal of Cavill's mustache) and others of dubious taste (construction of SteppeWolf).
'Justice League' is sometimes lost in two worlds traveling between the dark and the basic humorous cliché. It is a movie with some flaws, but very fun that will delight any fan of the genre. In the end, we have two post-credit scenes, one of which is really important that indicates the emergence of the Legion of Evil, rival to the Justice League, created by Lex Luthor, who had just escaped from the Arkham madhouse. It is essential that the viewer remains in the room until the last second. Justice League is not the perfect movie, but it is a light of hope in the DC universe."

","I am pleasantly surprised by this movie, especially the way it continued and developed one of the most interesting stories in the DC Universe - the death and return of Superman, which started with Batman v Superman/ Dawn of Justice. This was very well intercepted with other very important story concerning and uniting the Justice League for the first time - the invasion of Earth by the forces of Apokolips led by Darkseid's uncle and enthrusted commander Steppenwolf.

"klinefelter3","7","8","13","19 November 2017"," One of the better DC comic adaptations in recent years.
","I have been a DC fan since my childhood in the early-mid-80's, a time when I would get up early to watch ""Super Friends"" via antenna TV, or read the John Byrne reboot mini-series ""Man of Steel"" when it first hit newsstands. By my teens, Christopher Reeve and Michael Keaton personified Superman and Batman on the big screen and had not been recast or rebooted or reloaded or re-whatevered. And they had not been surrounded by countless Marvel competitors for moviegoers' increasingly limited attention spans. It is this audience that ""Justice League"" must contend for, which is sad, because the movie deserves a less hostile audience than the spoiled ""rotten"" one it has ultimately found.<br/><br/>This is not a perfect movie. But the good absolutely outweighs the bad, especially if you're specifically a ""DC fan"" and seeing some classic imagery done justice on the big screen is a treat. There is a good handful of images in this movie that genuinely tickled the DC comics nerd in me in ways that none of these films have as of yet. I don't think ""Justice League"" is quite made for general audiences in ways that Marvel films have tended to be; with geeks Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon calling the shots, it's no surprise that this film will appeal more to geeks than general audiences. That's not a defense of the movie, just an attempt to say who this may work for and who it may not.<br/><br/>The worst thing, by far, is the villain: Steppenwolf. I am simply baffled that talented and highly-paid people allowed this horrible CGI monstrosity to happen. He is every bit as terrible as the CGI villain from 2011's ""Green Lantern"" or the Necromancer from ""The Hobbit""- suffering from having a complete lack of personality and expressiveness.<br/><br/>Apart from Steppenwolf my complaints are mostly nitpicks... I really do love a lot of this flick. Perhaps most importantly, and I expect this will be general sentiment: I loved the whole League! Flash is hilarious. I want his movie out much quicker than 2020. Aquaman- a joke of a hero just a few years ago- is rad in this, and I very much look forward to more of him. Cyborg was never very interesting to me in the comics, and he's surprisingly good here. Wonder Woman gets to take her character up another notch from her movie, and Batman is much more likable here than in ""Batman V. Superman"". And... my god. My favorite superhero of all time, Superman: THANK YOU FOR GETTING SUPERMAN RIGHT. It was soooo refreshing seeing him SMILE. And be NICE. And LAUGH.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's score is a lot of fun, particularly for its nods toward classic hero themes. CGI- aside from Steppenwolf and a certain hero's digitally-erased mustache- is mostly quite good. The pace was very quick- which is good and sort bad; I really hope a longer cut comes out at some point- the idea that ""Justice League"" is far shorter than all other DCEU films to date is very odd, and I did feel it was a little too light in some aspects. Being a fan of the 3 hour Ultimate Cut of BVS, I would personally love to see an extended cut of this.<br/><br/>I don't think this movie is for everybody. But I do feel it is worth viewing more than critics may have you believe. It is not the ""Citizen Kane"" of superhero movies, however it is a very fun ride and if these characters mean anything to you at all it may be all you need to enjoy the ride. Snyder and Whedon treat these heroes as genuine icons and don't overburden us with origins and dramatic or pretentious dialogue. ""Justice League"" is fun, surprisingly light, epic, and quick. I am looking forward to seeing this team assemble again."

","I'm a big DC fan and have been since i was young. Bringing all the heroes to the big screen has been something I've been waiting to happen for a long time. I believe they nailed it! there was so many references to whole DC universe and at times there was the joke, which doesn't hurt. Every other person who is bashing movies like this is either not into superhero films or just don't like DC. The film had its slow parts but that's where the story needs to originate from and tell the audience whats actually happening, the fight scenes were spectacular and yes there was C.G.I but what superhero action movies don't have it these days. I loved the story and am enjoying the base that DC have started to build on, people will love it some people wont but if you like superhero movies with a good cast it wont let you down."
"albidala","3","14","26","18 November 2017"," DC gave about as much effort as Ben Affleck did
","I really tried. I really, really tried. <br/><br/>Reaching an expectation is like chasing a moving car. If you don't know who you're chasing, you don't know where they're going, why they're going. There is an impossibility to reaching expectations; I struggle with this reality going into every major blockbuster. ""Temper your expectations."" ""You want every movie to succeed."" Never have I wanted a movie to fail. A failing movie means we don't get more of the art, and getting someone to pay and adapt beautiful art is reason enough to keep making art. Justice League is not art.<br/><br/>I once read this article about how Geoff Johns and Zack Snyder have different visions of DC, because of Watchmen. Johns deplores the bleak world Alan Moore created. Snyder made a romance of it. You would imagine they'd have differing views of Superman. Justice League begins with found footage of kids interviewing Superman about what he thinks a hero is. I should have known what I was in store for as the first shot of Superman we get is one of his lower-face comically CGI'd to remove the mustache Henry Cavill grew for MI6. It's so obvious. The skin tone in his upper face doesn't match the lower one, and it just looks bad in all respects. The entire movie attempts to glorify Superman's accomplishments and what he stood for without offering any substance of what he actually stands for. There's no sense that the loss of Superman really turns the world upside down until the Motherboxes are awoken and scream for Steppenwolf, of whom, I guess, was just waiting around somewhere for thousands of years until Superman died, of whom only came to Earth a few decades prior. But, whatever, ""don't focus on the plot issues.""<br/><br/>You don't get a sense, outside of Wonder Woman -- and we only know her because Patty Jenkins gave us a hopeful introduction earlier this year -- that any of these heroes embody what Superman stands for. You don't get a sense that they even know what he stood for. But that is a clear thread Snyder and whoever made this wants you to explore. They did a ""Death of Superman"" story without allowing us to really know Superman and to know everyone important and Superman impacted them and/or the world. They just tell you ""hey, Superman is a beacon, and you should look at him like one."" 'Show, don't tell.'<br/><br/>The Batman BvS introduces us to is broody, rich. You can tell that his infamous trauma very much drives his life's work, his decision making. The Justice League Batman is a neutered icon. His only endearing quality to the team is he's ""rich."" Aside from Batman's guilt at causing Superman's death, you can't point to me a line of dialogue that says Batman believes anything he's doing in this movie is for the 'right thing.' ""Stopping Steppenwolf and his invading army to save the world is the 'right thing.'"" Okay.<br/><br/>The first time Batman meets a Parademon, he struggles in the fight. Is there even one time Batman wrecks a Parademon with his elite hand-to-hand combat moves? Every scene the League fights together in Batman requires the use of his toys, especially the big toys. I can understand that Batman is not superhuman, but in every fight scene he felt utterly useless compared to everyone else. If you've read a Justice League comic, you know Batman is exceptionally intelligent and that intellect allows Batman to truly stand alongside everyone else. You don't get a sense of that in this movie, it's probably all the times Batman says ""uh oh."" Let's not even forget how much he pines for Superman and especially his assistance during the latter fight scenes. This is the same guy that just tried to kill Superman in the last movie? Give me Scott Snyder's Batman, Tom King's Batman. One time, please!<br/><br/>If Justice League was the pilot for a show on HBO (it wouldn't be on HBO because HBO wouldn't waste so much money putting garbage out there), it would be fine. I would probably finish the season and leave it at that. Unfortunately, it was a major studio production that had me sitting there waiting for the post-credits stinger thinking 'maybe it's just impossible to make something good, coherent, cohesive with these characters.'"
"leaugebrett","4","14","26","17 November 2017"," The Cinematic Equivalent of a Loveless Marriage
","2017's Justice League is another entry in DC's desperate and rushed attempt at wrestling the superhero film genre back from Marvel. Instead of working to uniquely match the set design of Thor Ragnarok, drama of Logan, and the chemistry and combat sequences of The Avengers, Snyder & co have essentially created another Marvel ripoff. Apart from the performances of Gadot, Miller, and Fisher, the film is a slog to get through, filling scenes with nauseating action sequences and forced character chemistry. The main antagonist, Steppenwolf, is a bland ripoff from the Avengers, and the ""driving force"" in the movie, the ""Mother Boxes"" feel like a poorly motivated off-shot of the Infinity Stones.<br/><br/>I'm not a Marvel or DC fanboy, I'm just trying to talk about this film as a film. The superhero genre is more saturated than ever, and you have plenty of better options than this."

","The look and feel is not as good as Super Bat, at least that part is still a little cold and forceful. This one looks like a freak product, as if the decision-making layer is confused when it is building the future of DC, and it wants to be cool and think about the market. Part of it is still a serious pretense, but it has not been fully implemented; at the same time, some jokes are added casually, and the story is simpler. The entire video was a sequence, everyone hurriedly appeared, assembled, fought, and ended. I look forward to the protagonist of the second egg."

","This film by no mean is a top-tier super hero film. I mean the CGI can be a real eye sre. But in terms of the writing and acting.
I loved it! I came into this movie expecting hot trash but I enjoyed myself a-lot.
The Good.
I would say the Justice League (the characters) were really well written. I like Batfleck, Wonder Woman Flash Supes and Flash a lot. They have solid chemistry and the writing is solid overall for them. I only don't like Cyborg as he's kinda bland but I excuse it as. well his stories kinda depressing.
My main gripe with this film is the villain and Super Man's power.
Okay so this movie is a Mcguffen chase okay fine. SO WHY CAN THIS VILLAIN TELEPORT? It takes away so much potential since he can just zoop away I mean so much tension is most it goes against the film.
An super man. Ignoring horrible CGI stache I think the problem is he is so over powered. What's the point of having the JLA if he can wipe the floor with them?
Flash Batman and Wonder Woman could wipe the floor with him let's be real.
Aquaman's cool.

","The Good:
<ul><li>Casting is superb. All the characters are portrayed as D.C. Never get tired of BenA as batman and that growly voice! Never get tired of watching GalG. The new characters are also great, especially JasonM, he's a beast! Can't wait to see that origin story... When HenryC gets revived and blasts out, one of the best scenes for Super Man to follow...He is Superman...</li><li>Story is pretty good and so is the technical production. This plays out like a live comic book with real people. Keeps you in your seat!</li><li>Action and movements are also very good. Especially right at the beginning. love the slow / stop action scenes as it brings you closer to the action and the characters. Go 300!</li></ul><br/><br/>The Bad:
<ul><li>Sorry HC, should have shaved for this one. CGI facials are passable, but we're not there yet. You can pick out every one pretty much...You still cannot hide that true expression and feeling...like pain...hence, that connection to the character. He's not the only one...</li><li>There's a lot to interpret in this film, so that leaves many questions. But if you take it as it is, it is still a very good comic book turned movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>The Ugly :
<ul><li>The (cgi) facials, steppenwolf and the flash. Don't get me wrong, I thought the flash character was very interesting and somewhat refreshing. It's the Flash scene's where the character speeds around in a halo of lightning charges. the eye contact scene with Superman was the best scene, akin to Marvels Quick Silver in DoFP prison break. That's where the bar still sits...reach for it!</li><li>The way Batman vrs Superman ended, I did not believe he was dead. Therefor, it was hard to take in that whole element of the story about bringing him back, especially with halo lightning boy charges...nope...didn't like that part.</li></ul><br/><br/>It's worth seeing for sure, but Wonder Woman still holds the top DC ranking! Can't wait to check it out on 4K. Could be better, could be worse, we'll see...<br/><br/>JD"
"StaneSKT","6","6","9","18 November 2017"," Absolute Mess
","The most important movie in the DCEU? Yes. The best movie? NO! I dare to say that the movie is a total mess. BvS was not a good movie, but this one is even worse. Yes, I'm not kidding, there was not a single moment in the movie that I care about something or I'm under pressure about what's happening.<br/><br/>Batman was worse portrayed off than BvS, all he did was showing his new outfits, gadgets and make his traditional jumps. After Steppenwolf and Flash he got probably the dumbest replicas in the movie. Wonder Woman showed her ass and played the role of a leader more than Batman, but she did nothing special at all. I do not think there is a need to say that the movie is a full of slow-motion moments, and right at the beginning of the movie it has an unrealistic stupid Wonder Woman scene made in this way. Surprisingly, Cyborg was the best-represented character...before they started working together, when he also faded against the backdrop of what's going on. Some people will say that Flash is ""very good and fun"", it was very flat for me. Whatever you tell me Flash has never been so stupid in the comics, Bart Allen yes, but Barry Allen never. Aquaman shine with nothing except his badass vision. I was hoping for him to do something memorable, but the only thing we saw were slow motion scenes, watching him how wet and strong it's... the best we got was the quote from the trailer ""I can dig it"" and then, when sitting on the Batmobile, he says something relatively good.<br/><br/>The villain? Yeah, that's the worst villain I have ever seen in a movie, even Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Faced from Batman Forever (1995) was a better villain. Completely CGI villain with a banal motivation to conquer the world. The only thing Steppenwolf wins in my eyes is that he is the winner of the prize - ""Author of the dumbest speeches in the movie"". MOTHER...sounds stupid, it was finally clear that Overpowered Superman should intervene to defeat the ""big"" villain. Plus the parademons do not die, they still exist, and the whole film does nothing about them in the end.<br/><br/>Superman? Perhaps you all wonder how he's back in the movie...honestly all the theories that were written were light years better than what actually happened. Superman was revived by one of the Mother Boxes(yeah sounds lame) and confronted the whole league. Of course Batman got a ""trap"" that he could not resist - Lois Lane, after which everything was in order. Ooh ... I would have forgotten that the movie started with Superman and his mustache and an attempt to get rid of it through CGI, but as you guess, when I say it to you, it is evident, IT CAN'T BE UNSEEN, following a time in which it's again visible is his resurrection, simply can not be omitted.<br/><br/>Is there a Green Lantern? Yes, but it's just a few seconds and is not one of the main ones, it's just a flashback from the past war with Steppenwolf to show you that we'll see a new member of the league in the future. In the whole movie, it was not explained to anyone exactly what the three mother boxes can do, and why the benefit is so valuable, but everyone can steal them...The story was dumb, the League was gathered in a very controversial way. Humor was forced, if I laughed at something in the whole movie, it was 1 or 2 times maximum, everything else was a tragedy.<br/><br/>The movie is full of CGI and all the time you can not explain what is happening just as you can not explain why the ""big threat"" in the movie and its lair gathers the mothers boxes in an abandoned place in Russia where lives only one family that will then be rescued by Flash ... by pushing a car.<br/><br/>The movie has two post-credit scenes, the first one is fun and the second is something that DC needs to build in its Cinematic Universe in the future, but I do not see how it will happen if they continue to make such weak movies. I'm not a hater, but DC have some of the most famous heroes and even more famous villains, and the movies they make so far are insult to the fans. There are scenes in the movie that have no explanation, yeah I understand that these are fictional characters, and in the comicbook world everything is possible, but Flash falls while running fast and Batman catches him ... this is just one of many examples, for which I do not think to write.<br/><br/>I can say a lot, but honestly it is not worth it. I can't appreciate the movie higher than 5.5 or 6/10."

Maybe it's the psychological effect of going in to that movie expecting a masterpiece, and watching this one expecting a dud. I just thought Wonder Woman was very hokey and cliche throughout (especially the boyfriend). Justice League was solid all around IMO. Flash and Cyborg were great. Plot was decent. Action packed and witty.

I really wish each character could've had their own origin story first so that we could feel more invested in them. I also think the villain was a bit stale and cliche. But other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. The character interactions were great and the action scenes were top notch. Seeing some of the critic reviews for this movie really made me think Marvel has these critics in their pocket because they keep hating everything DC does but then give everything Marvel craps out these days 5 stars.

Well, I question the ability of some of these critics' ability to do their jobs... Justice League is Fantastic. Hands down. No one, no review what-so-ever, can convince me otherwise. I have now seen the film three times and it only got better with each viewing. None of what is criticized about this film is even remotely true and accurate. From the opening scene to the final battle, JL has everything a comic-book, superhero movie should have and more. The actors played their part beautifully and the chemistry between them on screen is top-notch. The CGI critique? Please. Unless directly pointed out (no thanks to social media) it goes completely unnoticed. That's the cold, hard fact. Those who claim they can tell Snyder from Whedon...again, give me a break. If it was never known or said, again, completely unnoticed. Deal with it. Steppenwolf is by no means weak. He was menacing. He was threatening. He was the big bad he was meant to be and the perfect precursor for what is to come, or should I say, who is coming. My one and only half-complaint is that Mera didn't get enough screen time that she deserved because she is a force to be reckoned with. Thankfully, there is a standalone Aquaman film coming and that minor, minor flaw will be rectified. In closing, ignore the trash- talk and go see the movie for yourself. Form your own opinions, but if you didn't like it, fine, but there is no need to trash someone because they liked it. Doing that says more about you than the film. Sad. I loved it.

The set up for the villain using DC mythology is nicely done. <br/><br/>Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman with elan (as she did in her solo movie) and Ezra Miller was a great choice for the Flash (different take to CW's TV show). Ben Affleck finally comes into his own as Batman, playing a reluctant, fallible but likable leader. <br/><br/>I think the true stars are Zack Snyder (I had completely written him off based on BvS, but I guess all that criticism made him come back better and more determined to succeed!) I believe Joss Wheedon (He directed Avengers Age of Ultron) was pulled in to finish this movie and his touch can be felt in refining and improving the work Snyder did. <br/><br/>I hope this movie helps shift gears for the DC cinematic universe and helps it go into full strength.

"Aesthete18","6","28","59","15 November 2017"," Not living up to expectation but an okay starting point
","Watched the movie yesterday and sigh...<br/><br/>Me and a buddy of mine went in with the lowest expectations, we didn't read anything, look at the ratings, nothing and we were still horribly disappointed. Literally at the same things at the same time.<br/><br/>If you're going to watch a DC movie, I'd recommend never watching the trailers again before going. They wasted so much good material on the trailers. At least 1/3 of it I was like, ""yup, seen that. yup, got that"". <br/><br/>The movie was almost set up to fail despite amazing casting and performances. I wasn't keen on the way Aquaman spoke and Cycborg's look and the fact that he was in the movie but damn was I wrong, they both nailed it! All of them did. I literally can't find anything wrong with the actors and how well the did.<br/><br/>(you should stop reading here if you don't want to go in with a tainted perception)<br/><br/>Why was this movie set up to fail? It was a number of things combined.<br/><br/>1. Expectation - As a DC fan going back to growing up to Keaton's Batman, this movie has been hyped for most of my life. Even more so since Marvel phase 1 started. Just the thought of, wow can't wait for DC to do this! So regardless of how well it turns out, it will still somewhat fall short in your head.<br/><br/>2. Trailers - as mentioned earlier, lots of material, plot and such was given away in them. I actually told my friend exactly what would happen down to the time frame and he'd just turn to me in the cinema every now and again and be like hey! you said that. You could literally piece the whole movie from the trailers. Now, I remember watching Guardians of the Galaxy 2 trailers and not knowing anything about the movie.<br/><br/>3. A bloody mess - it was all just a big mess that was rushed into nothing really. The flow was just bad but could have been worse I'll admit. There were major disappointments in some parts of the story. For someone who feels the music is just as important, the score was a real mess. I was really excited for the music because I didn't hear a Justice League theme song in the trailers and I was excited for a specific score from the last trailer. It was a mess. Horrible plot holes that I might be wrong about I'll concede that much. <br/><br/>There are a few things I'd give it credit for where I feel there were criticisms. <br/><br/>1. Villain - I've been reading about how generic and thinly plotted it was. Well, firstly the voice acting was great. Secondly, you'll be distracted from the mess of the overall movie to pay attention to flaws specific to him. Thirdly, I thought it was going to be another Ares, but he stood on his own despite looking somewhat similar. <br/><br/>2. CGI - the graphics were amazing, everything was very well done. The parademons looked great! way better than the Chitauri. Fight scenes were well done. On this end, everything was on point.<br/><br/>3. It can only get better - the movie is shaky and seems to be finding its feet which it doesn't really end up doing. From the looks of things it can only get better. It set up a good starting point and should be more polished second time around. <br/><br/>Final thoughts - everyone here has to and will watch it regardless of what I say. Just try your best to keep an open mind especially if you're not a layman. Look at it as a first bet rather than an all-in scenario. Even though I wasn't happy with it, I sure hope it is successful because they have a great cast. They just need someone better in-charge to paint a better picture."
"scandinavianmail","3","28","59","15 November 2017"," DC's slow descend back to camp
","An entirely forgettable affair in every sense of the word, Justice League fails to setup any further direction to the DC world-building than a slow descend back to camp where it was after Tim Burton's Batman movies 25 years ago. Nolan's years at helm are certainly far away by now.<br/><br/>The bafflingly conventional, illogical and randomly jumping story doesn't have a single unexpected turn of events and instead treads waters that have been trod many times before and with greater success. The CGI is strangely haphazard, with very little care how it stands out when scenes are edited together. Steppenwolf is an eye-wateringly bad villain, becoming a clumsy scarecrow whose motivations and powers come and go.<br/><br/>Actors are an uneven bunch, both as characters and as talents, and fail to generate camaraderie or chemistry. Ezra Miller is so much better as an actor than the rest that he becomes a distraction by reminding us about it constantly. Every time his delivery elevates the poor material, it turns against the movie when the next one who opens his mouth only looks cringe-worthy."

"justinwfirestone","4","27","57","16 November 2017"," Slightly not as bad as Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice
","Hey, Justice League is better than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, if for no other reason than it's a full half-hour shorter. Those, my friends, are 30 extra minutes you get to spend doing something else, anything else, instead of watching another DC UNIVERSE snoozefest.<br/><br/>With such star power as Henry Cavill, Ben Affleck, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher, Jason Momoa, Gal Gadot, and national treasure Amy Adams, no wonder they could not afford to pay Ciarán Hinds to actually appear in the movie as the big bad baddie, Steppenwolf. That's right, folks, it's your favorite and most popular DC villain ever, Steppenwolf in full CGI gloritude.<br/><br/>What's that you say? You've never heard of Steppenwolf? Well, he's been hiding for thousands of years but can appear anywhere using a blue cylinder dealie thing and he has a legion of scary flying zombie things that are actually pretty easy to kill. Steppenwolf, however, is really strong, and he has a wicked-cool fiery axe up with which he chops stuff and he's sorta angry all the time and never really shuts up. Oh, and apparently the last time he tried to destroy Earth everyone got together and teamed up to defeat him so that seems like a really good idea again, but it's going to be really tough to get superheroes to band together because they all lead such complicated and interesting lives.<br/><br/>Steppenwolf is really powerful, but he can become, like, really super-duper powerful if he can get three Mother Boxes (that's right, I said ""Mother Boxes"") together, much like Mola Ram hunting for three Sankara stones, or was it heavy water, red crystals, and meteor dust? Good thing we only have to find three of them, because finding six of them would take too long. Also of note is you can revive Superman with one of them, which is pretty cool, because he can probably punch Steppenwolf's head clean off all by himself.<br/><br/>Nice also we have no real back story for any of the newbies. Yes, Flash is a goofy dork who gets to have the most fun, but pretty much everyone else, especially Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill, look like they've been sprayed with stupid dust and inhaled it for a few hours. Also, Cyborg is sort of like a nicer Lawnmower Man, I think. Gonna have to check the press guide on that one.<br/><br/>Oh, no Jared Leto?! Perhaps too busy planning his next hairstyle.<br/><br/>Oh, and hi to Jeremy Irons, J.K. Simmons, and Diane Lane! See you next time!"
"K-Nestler84","1","16","31","23 November 2017"," Predictably poor. Absolute trash. Fanboys will love it no matter what but everyone else steer clear
","A failure of epic proportions. After Batman and Robins abysmal critical and financial failure in 1997, no one ever thought Batman would ever be seen as cool again. Batman seemed to forever be ruined after a series of bad films in the 90s. Luckily in 2005, Christopher Nolan gave us the best Batman to date by far with Christian Bale donning the cape. Follow the success of that reboot we not only got the most inspired and brilliant trilogy of Batman movies, but one the the best trilogy of movies period. Grossing billions at the box office, getting IMMENSE critical praise, and landing on every serious movie fans all time favorites list. It seemed thanks to Nolan, Bale, and co. Batman could do no wrong.. Only a few years later movie studio WB got stupid and presumably listening to the wrong fan base (you tubers who account to a small handful of unemployed losers) who hated the success and wanted a more cartoony, goofy, generic Batman and dc films. Instead of smartly observing the colossal success of the dark knight trilogy and following through that proved successful path for their other DC properties, they went with the 2 or 3 guys on you tube who bitched and moaned and pushed for goofy, mindless fodder. Also I assume WB wanted to rush to mimic Marvels success with Avengers ( afar superior film to Justice League). Here we are with the final product. Surprise Surprise. After the failures of Man of Steel, Batman V Superman, and Suicide Squad ( all had great potential that was squandered), who really expected JL to be anything but the same old trash we've been getting? Well if anything, there has been consistency. In this DCEU, the films get progressively worse than the last. Man of Steel was bad, BvS was terrible, Suicide Squade was abysmal, and JL is...the worst one of all. Bravo. If mindless action set piece after mindless action set piece with terrible cw level CGI, generic standard, take over the world plot by CGI villain with a cast of completely undeveloped plot, corny jokes, and boredom is your thing, well then check it out and enjoy. Everyone else who wants quality filmmaking, a good story, stand out action and spectacle, steer clear of this mess. Its a shame for those who waited so long for a live JL movie. Fanboys will be in denial and convince themselves this movies isn't that bad but it is. Ben Affleck also joins Clooney as the two worst portrayals of Batman"
"apurvasingh-87567","6","16","31","17 November 2017"," Good movie but very predictable
","This year's most anticipated movie is finally out and its good for most of the part but could've been definitely a lot better. <br/><br/>The movie is fairly well structured unlike BvS but it has a very poor ending. First let's talk about the story. It's pretty straightforward and predictable and lacks any twist. You have a villain who wants his own hell and the Justice League is there to stop that from happening. Nothing new that we haven't seen already done before.<br/><br/>The characters have a good chemistry between each other for most of the part but some are more lackluster than the others. Ben Affleck as Batman is once again good in this movie especially in the first half but sadly he doesn't show his badassery in fight scenes like in BvS. This time he also has some funny scenes which I liked and had no problem. Ezra Miller as Flash might be a hit or miss and some might even compare him to Quicksilver from the X-Men series. I, myself did enjoy his comic relief and his light hearted behavior that he brought to the team but others might criticise him for that. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, this time has some great fight scenes and is given a good amount of screen time which was good to see. Cyborg surprisingly has a huge part to offer the story which I wasn't expecting. He isn't very great but certainly did not disappoint. Jason Momoa as Aquaman looked great in the trailers but sadly that's all he had in him in the entire movie. I really wanted a badass scene involving him at the center. Don't want to talk much about Superman but he is too overpowered and takes away the sense of terror that the villain established throughout the plot easily in the final fight which was underwhelming to see. <br/><br/>Now people might criticise the light hearted tone in contrast with the gritty dark tone of its previous movies like MoS and BvS and compare it to Marvel movies. Yes, this movie does try to be funny and light hearted and for most of the part, the jokes were fairly good, nothing great and some very similar to Marvel's style but we need to ""deal with it"" since it's writers can't come up with a mature plot good enough for its previous dark tone. I still think Man of Steel was pretty well balanced but then again there were people that criticised it and called it boring.<br/><br/>The part's that I disliked were the weak villain Steppenwolf and some poor cgi effects especially in the final fight. It looked ugly and sometimes looked very poor like taken from a video game like others have pointed out. Overall, this movie is predictable and has nothing unique to offer. It's a good movie nonetheless but don't expect it to be great."

","Before i watched this i had little hope and almost no expectations for this movie. after all struggle for this movie to be done and after all dc problems over all. Maybe it is because joss whedon came in. But this movie is a really good time. <br/><br/>Ben affleck as batman is getting stronger in his role. So would hate to see him leave now when he looks perfect in the role. The new players aqua man flash and cyborg also does a great job. <br/><br/>Superman is off course back and FINALLY this feels like superman. Henry feels like he is like to do this role. Superman comes back in a good way and the group works good with him. The dynamic feels genuine. Wonder woman is also good in this movie. So the superheros are great. <br/><br/>Is it a perfect movie? No off course not. It has some flaws. Over all the movie looks good. Nice shots and framing. But the villain is pretty bland and a standard superhero villain. Almost thought they would do like batman vs superman and bring in a bigger villain ( maybe dark side ) in the end. But they didn't. <br/><br/>So the biggest problem in this movie is that is to short. I would like to have more back story , more group scenes when they starting to know one another. Maybe see flash train in some fighting styles. He and Cyborg try out their powers. <br/><br/>Hopefully an extended version comes out. But over all, i really liked this movie and i really hope people go and see this movie. This movie deserves to been watched. DC is Back is all i can summon this with, Hopefully they stay on this right track. <br/><br/>the end teases that ( big spoiler) lex luthor is brining a group of bad guys together. Slade Wilson aka death stroke seems to join in the end credit and that got me very excited. <br/><br/>So 9/10 go and watch this movie. I know i will watch it at least one more time at the cinema."

","Did DC finally get it right when it comes to Mash Ups?<br/><br/>Ever since George Millers Justice League: Mortal movie was cancelled back in 2008, DC fans across the globe have been wondering when we would get our chance to see the League come together on the big screen. We got the trinity with last year's Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice but that movie didn't go over so well with fans. Now that could have been because WB had too much pull when it came to editing the movie or that could be because the movie just didn't feel right. I will leave my personal opinion aside and just chalk it up to editing a poor scripted story.<br/><br/>Over the summer we given some hope when Wonder Woman hit the big screen. The story was damn near perfect and made even better with the right director behind the helm, that begin Patty Jenkins. After watching Wonder Woman and seeing how well it did that left me with hope that Justice League would be great. It is no secret that the film had numerous reshoots led by Avengers Director Joss Whedon, and he was rumored to be brought in to oversee post production after Zack Snyder left the project to cope with an untimely death of his daughter, thoughts and prayers are still with the Snyders. <br/><br/>When it was announced that Whedon would be doing reshoots of the film, the rumors started to fly that the film was beginning to take a dark turn down a road so familiar of BvS:DoJ, but after watching the film tonight, I am in Germany, I can see that the original rumored ""dark tone"" of Justice League was given a more heartfelt tone. <br/><br/>Aside from the obvious CGI on Henry Cavill to remove a contract mandated mustache for his upcoming role in the next Mission Impossible film, the work on Ray Fisher as Cyborg and the rubbery looks of some of Jason Momoas Aquaman scenes, the film isn't as bad as we'd be led to believe. It is actually a good film, not great, a little cheesy at times, but a good film.<br/><br/>Is there room for improvement? Absolutely! No film is perfect, not even the golden children of Marvel. Justice League is what we can expect it to be, a super hero mash up. The acting is great, the characters have good chemistry, the actors work well together and it flows unlike previous entries in the DCEU. Will I be upset if they don't make a sequel? Yes as there are some unanswered questions and after watching that after the credits scene, I have a ton of questions. So, I give this film a solid 7/10. There is always room for improvement."

So, I watched JL again and realised there was more depth to it than I previously thought.

Also, that opening scene with Superman....I can only call it disturbing. It was even worse than Brannagh's fake moustache in Murder on the Orient Express!! Can't imagine why Henry Cavil wants out....???<br/><br/>That being said, the smaller scenes are quite good. The characters were all enjoyable and the chemistry between them was good.

","With a touch of the 'The Magnificent Seven' in style, the superheroes quickly get down to business of joining forces and producing the goods. The bickering and bonding spike the film with humour but sadly there is something missing in the charisma of these characters. Batman cuts a reduced figure - Ben Affleck's muscularity and desperate demeanour is appealing but he is less impressive delivering the droll humour and at times he is dull in the exchanges. A film with such a fantastical setting demands alacrity from its characters. Cyborg offers little more than crabbiness and so we are left with Wonder Woman to add some sparkle and charisma. By the second act fatigue sets in, with repetition in the action sequences. It's a thinly-written story but there's plenty of good visual effects and Flash serves up some good one-liners."

","After seeing the extremely disappointing Suicide Squad, I didn't know what to make of future DC films, because I was hopeful after seeing the amazing Wonder Woman, but scared after Suicide Squad. After checking this movie out, it's the best (and worst) of both worlds. It has some of the thrills and good story arch as Wonder Woman while keeping the predictability and a little of the exposition of Suicide Squad. In other words, this movie isn't all that great, but it's not bad at all either, as the high notes do outweigh the negatives. The positives make this movie a fun watch, as it has great performances, bright and colorful CGI, fun action scenes, and a good story flow that felt more focused than previous DC movies. However, this film suffers hard from the extremely predictable story and the amount of exposition which wasn't needed. It wasn't as bad as it was in Suicide Squad, but it's strange to see it in here especially since it's about every hero in the DC Universe, whom are all already well known. This, unfortunately, causes some of the great moments to feel a bit sluggish at times. The story, like I said, is very predictable and painfully bland, as it's the exact same ""Stop the bad guy and win"" cliche in every other superhero movie, and for this film being the first in the 2010s to have most of the main DC heros to have such a half-assed story is disappointing. But thankfully, as I stated earlier, the movie does have a better focus and better story arch than previous films, so despite this movie not having a great story, it was still entertaining. Overall, this movie is a massive step in the right direction when it comes to DC to finally make great movies consistently, and while this movie isn't quite there yet, it shows hope for future DC films. I recommend this movie for any DC fan out there, as it has enough to keep any fan of DC fan entertained, as this is, indeed, a good, yet flawed superhero movie. However, for those who want to watch a great superhero movie and they don't care which team it is, I recommend the Avengers a lot more."

The antagonist, Steppenwolf, a pretty powerful sinister villain causes all sorts of problems for all the superpowered heroes around him.<br/><br/>And of course, there are no spoilers to be had in DC's worst kept open obvious secret that Superman was always going to return. And when he does it's handled very well indeed.<br/><br/>DC still has a lot of work to do and some ground to make up to catch up to Marvel Studios, who I think are probably too far ahead and possibly out of sight, but for me, this was the best movie in the DCEU so far."

It's obvious that DC is in a rush but they should've seen it coming. The characters had little if at all development, lots of scenes felt awkward , without any chemistry. On addition, because of that, it's hard for the audience to connect with the characters and really develop some kind of an attachment which is crucial in actually really caring about what's happening.<br/><br/>2) The CGI was awful. I can't really understand why, since the budget wasn't low, but some scenes felt very fake.<br/><br/>3) The villain was a joke. At no point in the movie did he feel threatening. Quite boring and a poor selection by the writers. Generally the plot was very bad and the main reason the movie never shined. <br/><br/>4) The acting was ok, nothing outstanding. <br/><br/>5) Liked the balance between ''serious conversations'' and jokes told.

While every other dummy heroes tries their best to fight off Steppenwolf (Batman does nothing by the way, he's more like a supporting cast during this fight) when all hope is lost Superman comes and saves the day without a sweat. What an amazing plot! <br/><br/>Gosh! Everyone thank Zack Snyder for turning our childhood fantasy into a nightmare yet again."

But above all invest emotion into the film.<br/><br/>DC fans deserved better than this - Snyder -Terrio - Whedon - hang your heads in shame."
"LloydBayer","5","17","34","15 November 2017"," Although long time in the making, Justice League ultimately proves to be unnecessary.
","After years of speculation and uncertainty, DC Films' answer to Marvel's Avengers is finally here. But is it necessary? Fans, movie pundits, studio suits and everyone else in between can argue over this for years. The answer is irrelevant, and given the outcome, even rhetorical. <br/><br/>As awkward as it sounds, Justice League - with no less than five latex clad superheroes - is the finale to director Zack Snyder's trilogy (following Man of Steel and Batman Versus Superman) but also distances itself from the previous two by trying to fix common complaints about those films - too dark and no spunk, we said. Well guess what; The makers behind Justice League heard our protests and made this film as bright as day. There's also some humour that will draw a genuine smirk from all but the sternest viewer or harshest critic. That's it. Everything else is an incoherent, incomplete, unguided, unwanted mess. <br/><br/>The problems are plenty because that mess is all over the place. On one level, the world is still mourning the death of Superman. Like the previous film, Biblical analogies are apparent, but only if you care to look below the surface and only if you know what to look for; which is why a genuine question in this film is whether or not a God can be resurrected, and if so, should that happen. Then the tone shifts to familiar territory. On another level, the planet is about to be destroyed by Steppenwolf (played by Ciarán Hinds by bizarrely imitating Liam Neeson), an alien general done up with bad CGI. And then there is Bruce Wayne who claims his superhero ability is being rich. If that isn't a stab at Tony Stark, is it meant to be funny? After hobbling along with these one-liners for an hour, the titular roster is setup for the first and bombastic clash of superpowers. But by this time we are essentially watching two movies, and it won't take long before it dawns on the viewer that something isn't quite right. Or not altogether there. <br/><br/>Even as alarming as that sounds, there is yet another movie which struggles to break through the superficial cracks of the main movie, and this is probably why Justice League is almost forgivable - The idea of a team of misfits trying to fit, (which made The Avengers hugely entertaining) seems to find some footing in this film too. Ezra Miller's Barry Allen, AKA The Flash, holds a candle to Tom Holland's Peter Parker. For better or worse, Miller even has a lot more pep than Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne and Batman combined! Another welcome addition is Jason Momoa as the brooding Aquaman, and although there's something fishy about his supersonic speed, there's not much else explored.<br/><br/>When it works, it's because of the camaraderie between some of the characters. Along with Miller's Flash, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is almost always one of them. Consistency, though, is not a strong point in this film. In the end, and despite being salvageable, Justice League is content with breeding familiarity. This includes a villain that is both weak and boring, and with an agenda that we have seen one too many times. As for Ray Fisher's Cyborg, there's little doubt that anyone will remember how and why he is a member of the League. While all this is still forgivable given Snyder's tragic personal loss during filming, the biggest undoing is a superhero film unsure of what it wants to be. Which again asks – was this necessary?"

","Boy has DC Comics come a far way when it comes to its cinematic adaptations. For years, we've gotten a lot of Batman and Superman movies. It wasn't until Man of Steel when Warner Brothers decided to follow Disney and Marvel's footsteps and create their own cinematic universe. Man of Steel was split for a lot of people, but it had managed to establish it's own identity that actually fairs well with DC's image. The difference between to comic giants was that Marvel was humans becoming gods and DC was gods becoming humans. So why has it continued to split people?<br/><br/>A lot of it has to do with how Warner Brothers has been handling it's property. Like a lot of people, I blame that rather then doing the work of making several movies before they get to a major crossover point, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice tried to jump five steps ahead by having too much of a good thing. Now that were looking at Justice League, it has a lot to live up to. For many of these characters, this is the first time were seeing the Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg on the big screen. Let's see if Justice League can live up to it's expectation and be heroic. <br/><br/>After Supermans death, Bruce Wayne (played by Ben Affleck) has decided to atone for his mistake of misjudging and build a team of metahumans or fellow super powered humans in case another threat comes to Earth. With help from Alfred (played by Jeremy Iron) and Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Played by Gal Gadot), they talk to the quick willed Barry Allen (played by Ezra Miller) from Central City, the legendary fish man of the Scandinavian Arthur Curry (played by Jason Momoa) and the half human half artificial intelligent living computer Victor Stone (played by Ray Fisher) into joining their new league. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, an alien villain Steppenwolf (played by Ciarán Hinds) has returned to Earth to try and reclaim a set of ""mother boxes"" in order to start an apocalypse. One of then is in Atlantis, another is on Diana Prince's home island Themyscira, and one more is hidden within the human world. Though the team of heroes, now called the Justice League, manage to retrieve the final mother box, Steppenwolf has built an army that has proved difficult for everyone. Will Superman make a return to help his fellow metahumans?<br/><br/>Justice League is a messthat happens to have good things within. Let's get into the positives first. It's clear that director Zack Snyder (and Joss Whedon) has understood the mistakes from Batman V Superman, and have done things to improve. The plot is tighter and focused on one goal; stop the villain from taking over the world. The overall look is going in the right direction with brighter colors taking fold, thus making guys like Wonder Woman and the Flash seems more like beacons of hope. Plus, the relationships between the characters are more defined and are used to it's entertaining advantage. <br/><br/>The two favorites here are Miller as the Flash and Gadot as Wonder Woman. They have a fair amount of screen time that establishes Miller as inexperienced, but with a mouth that's as quick as his actions. Gadot is showing more vulnerability has her connection to the humans has evolved since Wonder Woman. Affleck is great as Batman, but looks constanly disinterested as Bruce Wayne. Momosa does okay with his material (though with not enough time to show more of his personality) and Cyborg seems to have gotten the shaft as he's only in to do computer stuff for the sake of the plot. The problem is that Justice League feels like the tenth film in a series that seems to have skipped ahead (again, that blame is on Batman V Superman for rushing the cinematic universe).<br/><br/>Now for the negatives. Steppenwolf is a surprisingly boring villain as he's your typical one- dimensional villain bent on destruction. Nothing new and even worse then Lex Luther's poor motivation in the last movie. A lot of the humor adds a bit more of a necessary lighter tone, but it doesn't always mesh with the Snyder-tone already established. Though it's been well publicized that Joss Whedon took over for the reshoots, it's painfully obvious when he came in, given that his are more humorous when compared to some of the fight scenes and other development scenes that are more grim and serious. <br/><br/>I'll give this five Justice League comics out of five. This movie is learning as it's going, but it still has a lot of rough spots. I hope that future DC films lay off on the crossovers in order to give characters like the Flash and Aquaman a chance to shine in their own movies. I doubt I'll return to this like I do for Tim Burton's Batman, but I can see a lot of people overcoming this mistakes for the films more entertaining parts. If your just looking for your heroes fighting, you'll get plenty of it. You'll even get a lot of laughs and entertainment. I just don't think it's for me. Take it in perspective and see if the DC cinematic is worth saving."

","So I woke up at 6:30 am to watch the first screening of Justice League at 7:45 am. I booked myself the best IMAX seat in the theater. There were only a handful of people on the balcony section. So there, I had the perfect setting. <br/><br/>The movie starts off with a video phone recording of Superman. It has a very positive start. It follows off with building up on the rest of the Superheros including Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and a nice emotional scene of Barry Allen (The Flash) with his father in prison.<br/><br/>The tone of the movie is very upbeat and also dark in places where required. Steppenwolf is a worthy adversary albeit made up entirely of CGI. I had no problem with CGI at all. His devotion to world domination was portrayed as best as it can be. Perfect comic book to screen adaptation. <br/><br/>The team comes together very nicely and we see the reason why they must all come together since as individuals, they are unable to thwart Steppenwolf's plan to acquire the 3 motherboxes.<br/><br/>Spoilers Ahead:<br/><br/>The best part of the film was the rebirth scene of Superman. It is hands down the best portrayal of the comic book Superman on screen EVER. It shows his true prowess and why he is the true leader of the Justice League; mowing down the likes of WW, Batman, Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash as if they're mere annoyances. The best line from Kal- El to Bruce in that scene, ""Tell me something, do you bleed?"". Pure awesomeness.<br/><br/>The action is amazing, the CGI and special effects are perfect and the story and characters all have a very sincere depth to them. I had no doubt in my mind that Zack Snyder will deliver and boy, did he ever. The soundtrack pays perfect homage to past Superman and Batman. <br/><br/>Stay past the credits ALL the way and you will be surprised twice. <br/><br/>This is the Superman and JL movie I have been waiting for all my life. Do not believe the naysayers and the bubblegum superhero fans.<br/><br/>This is the DC Comic book film to rule over ALL other superhero films out there of past, present and future."
"denizcimen","1","16","32","17 November 2017"," The worst after s.squad
","The characters they introduce in the movie don't get much backstory, which might be due to the fact that Warner Brothers required this movie to be two hours exactly. They try to make the tone of this film less dark by adding in jokes, many of which didn't really land for me. Some one-liners they have in this film are kind of cheesy, like when Cyborg says ""boo-yah"" after beating the para demons and when Superman says ""I like justice"", it just felt weird at times. The CGI looked kind of cheap at times, especially on the villain Steppenwolf, who looked like a video game character. I also thought 2012 CGI on the Chitauri in the Avengers looked way better than the CGI on the para demons in this movie. Especially in the finale of the movie with the red sky, this movie looked like a video game a lot, and the action was chaotic and hard to follow. I also thought the heroes were sort of helpless before Superman arrived to beat down Steppenwolf, Wonder Woman especially was underpowered in this film. At least it's better in tone than Batman vs. Superman and a bit funnier than Suicide Squad."

","I came into this movie with high hopes, at least assuming it couldn't be any worse that Batman V Superman. Unfortunately, it was just terrible.<br/><br/>The dialogue is frequently very cheesie. The villain is so boring. Part of a characters face is CGI'd and looks horrendous. Characters freely shout out secret identities in front of civilians. Portals ""conveniently"" open up at perfect times, and in perfect locations. There is a random family that is shown every so often, and we are supposed to care about their well-being. Yet the movie does nothing to make us feel attached to, or even learn anything whatsoever about these people. So when they are in danger, it's not even of concern to the audience. And then the one thing that really bothered me the most...The final battle does not have a single drop of water in it!! AQUAMAN IS A MAIN PART OF FILM! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?!? I'm not saying the entire battle should've taken place on or near water. But at the very least, the director should've found a way to use water since it is what a MAIN CHARACTER can control. That was pathetic.<br/><br/>There are many more things I could bring out, but I wanted this review to not contain spoilers so that hopefully people that read it won't waste their money on watching the movie.<br/><br/>There are 4 funny lines in the movie I enjoyed, and 1 really cool action scene near the beginning with the Amazon's. But those things were not enough for me to give this movie even a 2nd star.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money watching this in theaters.

"iamiraclelingcoran","5","9","16","26 April 2018"," Injustice.
","Justice League (2017) is a film, filled with such mediocrity, that does so little (if not nothing) to justify its legendary and beloved comic book characters. Most of characters in the film either falls flat or becomes unnecessary, to the point where you ask yourself why the movie even exists. 
I want to start off with Bruce Wayne/Batman's character, because I absolutely hate him in this film. More accurately, I hate how they've written the character. The words he delivers are but white noise, and he just seems much goofier and sillier than ever. I loved Ben Affleck's performance in Batman v Superman: DoJ, but this film took everything that was great about him. His movements inside the bulky costume always seem stiff and constrained. His constant monologues about ""enemies from far away"" and ""I'm putting together a team"" just falls flat and unnatural due to the lack of context and setup. However, there is one moment in the film where I truly felt something genuine. When Bruce says, ""Superman was more human than me"", I saw the real Batman. It was a refreshing moment, until the film falls back into a whirlwind of uninspired CGI-heavy battles. Batman, in the midst of all the destruction, can't seem to have much purpose but to stand around and shoot flying bugs. 
Wonder Woman was 'okay' in this film, given that she was amazing in her preceding solo outing. Her character feels much more of a leader and team-builder than Bruce, with her warmth and kind-heartedness resonating with the others. However, the film takes a step back from what her solo film has established, constantly diminishing her into a sexualised figure. The obvious inclusion of 'butt shots', tight leather pants, low cut top, high angle shots that emphasise her exposed legs while in costume, and some comments and gestures on her ""beauty"" by her all-male teammates. 
Cyborg, on the other hand, is rather quite interesting (at least during his introduction). He delivers the most engaging character moment during the first act of the film, and comes across as a flawed yet special character. However, the film does very little to develop his character further. This is where the film falls apart. The fact that the audience are meeting these heroes for the first time means there's very little connection with these characters, leading to a more detached experience. Also, I hate how Cyborg looks (this is purely subjective, and nothing major). Not a fan. Perhaps his design reflects his chaotic nature, but I prefer a cleaner look (as seen towards the end of the film). 
The Flash is a hugely annoying character, for me. I hate him. He is funny at times, but often goofy. His movements also look ridiculous, especially when he's running on the street during the final minutes of the film. Ezra Miller is a great actor, but he is not the Flash (not even close). 
Aquaman is pretty 'okay' in this film. He doesn't strike me as an interesting character, but he's cool at times. Again, nothing much here to attach myself to the character. 
The film falls flat with its underwhelming villain, and apparent lack of tension or a sense of adversity. Steppenwolf looks and feels 'okay', if not terrible. This villain is highly one-dimensional with barely any interesting persona. There's barely any tension between him and the Justice League, other than physical danger. Overall, Steppenwolf is nothing but a mediocre, seen-that-before antagonist. 
The visual effects are quite noticeably unpolished at times, ranging from obvious green screens to unnatural movements and lighting on fully-CGI characters. The musical score is good, yet nothing special. I am disappointed that the most iconic comic book ensemble does not have a memorable theme song. Not a fan of the film's visual style. It looks cheap, like a standard television production. Overall, I think the film is average at best. Nothing special here ... an injustice towards the Justice League."

"thomasrakewell","5","9","16","17 November 2017"," It's okay...
","You know what, I don't disagree with all the bad reviews for Justice League, but it's still okay anyway. The way I see it is this: you remember the old, iconic theme music that Batman and Superman had? The best themes, Danny Elfman's and John Williams', from the 80s and 90s. Well in Justice League they are used again BUT... neither of them are played in their entirety. You hear a slight snippet, literally a barely recognisable snippet, buried underneath other noise, but they never just play it. You never get that rousing, exciting, recognisable moment. And the whole film is like that. The actors are all great, but the script gives none of them a standout moment. There's no jeopardy or risk. Just big empty CGI-scapes. The superheroes don't worry about their alter egos or hidden identities, removing all the fun. They don't rescue civilians or do anything clever, just exist in a computer generated world. And the CGI is dodgy, really very dodgy in places (if you've seen it, you'll know what I mean). It makes you long for Christopher Reeve or Michael Keaton or Christian Bale, not because the new actors aren't good but because those old stories had heart. Even Wonder Woman doesn't get a chance to shine here, all her innocence and strength of character (and talk of men because ""just and wise"" etc) are sucked out in favour of bland chat and upskirt shots. So that's it, Justice League. I'm glad I saw it, I'm also sort of glad it's over. I'll probably get it on DVD at some point, and I'll probably watch it once or twice."

","The most repeated word you will hear from many critics will be the word 'fun' which it seems is becoming a key word for almost every good or average tent pole movie there is, which is not a bad thing to be especially if you are at an early stage of making a cinematic universe which already have several 'not fun' movies in its filmography. But it seems that this time they have managed to achieve the marvel quality even if it was at the expense of the serious tones that had previously differentiated it from most of the other superhero movies which is becoming quite tiring for most of us, it is certainly becoming tiring for me and I would have stopped going to this one as well if it were not for the characters that this movies have managed to make us care about... it is the characters and their personality that makes this one a worth while which was not the case with the previous entries excluding wonder woman.... this time they have actually managed to make these characters more entertaining, funny and in one case more bad ass than they were previously thought to be... which helps the movie because the story certainly is not a strong point here... same goes with acting, music and vfx... they are workable or average and don't really hinder the experience itself so I would say that it is quite an enjoyable movie from DC universe... not as good as wonder woman for sure but certainly an entertaining piece.

"sarahjaneiom","2","12","23","20 November 2017"," One of the worst movies I have seen at the cinema
","I think the only word I can use to describe this film is disappointment. The characterization of the existing characters (Superman, Batman and Wonder woman was poor) and the remaining characters were very one dimensional. In my opinion there are two directions a super hero movie can take. First, add in plenty of humour and likable characters like the Marvel movies (particularly Guardians and the recent Thor movie). Alternatively you can make a gritty dark movie like the Dark knight. The Justice League and the DCEA in general fails at both of these things. delivering something that feels dated, lacks any kind of emotional connection or any suspense and horror. The villain in this movie was very poorly constructed and was almost identical to Ares (the villain from Wonder Woman).<br/><br/>This brings me on to my final gripe of the movie: Wonder Woman. DC is holding up wonder woman as a feminist icon and yet 1. Why is she not recruiting further women to the team (the female green lantern or black canary would make valuable additions to the team) 2. Why is is that all the men wear suits that make sense to actually protect their bodies and she is still given a skimpy costume that looks like something someone would have come up with the the 70s.<br/><br/>So if you want to go see a dated film, watch the Christopher Reed superman because it is a thousand times better than this rubbish."

He was probably the funniest, and I am so happy they didn't use the Orange and Green suit. Wonder Woman; Pretty much the same performance as in her solo movie, and that's good. Flash; Funny at times, cringey when not. Cyborg; He enunciates well. Jeremy Irons is also good as Alfred.I'd put him in the middle. The Plot;<br/><br/>This is the worst part of the movie. It starts by aggressively flinging you around the World, introducing everyone. Something about Box, characters, Box, characters. Speaking of those boxes, the villain Steppenwolf, is horrible. He has no motivation other than 'I destroy stuff'. Oh, and get this... Superman comes back. I'll bet you had NO IDEA that was gonna happen. He forgets who he is, Wonder Woman tries to get him to 'Remember who you are, Simba' Lois comes in to make him remember, and the have some romantic banter, probably written by George Lucas. 'You smell good' 'I didn't before?'. The third act comes on and they fight Steppenwolf, and ironically, dies the same way as Jeremy Iron's Character in Lion King. Eaten by his minions.

Yes, I am a little biased because I'm a big DC fan, but I still went into the movie with an open mind, for better or worse.

I have to say that despite my best efforts to see past small problems, I found it very difficult to like this movie. I am a fan of primarily the DC trinity. Have been for at least 15 years, and I know that would lead people to think that my problems are likely an objection to the changes from the source material. Let me assure you, they are not. This movie is, at times, disjointed and aloof. It leaves too many things unexplained; so much so that it becomes distracting. Furthermore, it is completely riddled with CGI. There's even evidence of CG in scenes that I wouldn't think require much CG. Most of the worst CG are found in scenes with the villain or Superman.<br/><br/>Let me clarify, there are redeemable qualities in this movie. Almost every time Wonder Woman is on screen, she makes the movie better. I still don't take issue with Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman/Bruce Wayne (his motivations and decisions are another matter). I found Cyborg surprisingly compelling. There are a few funny jokes (but also a few truly terrible ones). I was actually excited by some of the backstory and Easter eggs in the movie (the flashback was a highlight for me). And I can really appreciate what they were going for here, but the execution was so problematic.<br/><br/>I hated how the amazons were treated in this movie and how they went from wearing roman-style armour in the previous (female directed) film, to stylized bikini-clad warriors in this (male directed) movie. 2 steps forward, one step back I guess.<br/><br/>I mostly hated the dialogue and the unanswered questions. The dialogue, like most Zack Snyder movies is so unnatural and ridiculous, not even Joss' snappy word play could save it. At one point Superman says ""but I also believe in Justice"" and I rolled my eyes so hard I thought I would pass out. The villain is never properly explained. Like, how did he get here? How does he have access to his minions? What is his larger plan? I know that it all ties to a larger villain, but it's not explained to the audience. The casts' abilities and power levels are all over the place and the new recruits are given no explanation as to how or why they would suddenly be capable to do battle on the level of the DC trinity (who have trained in combat).<br/><br/>I could go on, but there's no point. It will do well. It's the first time we've seen some of these characters, so we'll get more of this and the criticisms won't ultimately matter. But DC could learn a lot from Marvel. It's worth taking your time to build up a cohesive narrative rather than trying to play catch-up. I'd recommend waiting to see it rather than spending $20 to see it in a theatre. Save your money for Thor Ragnarok."

","I'm marking this as ""contains spoilers"" although I will do my best to keep spoilers to a minimum. Any legitimate spoilers contained in this review will be in service of explaining why Justice League is a ham-fisted, stupid mess of a film. Please enjoy.<br/><br/>So it's not a spoiler to reveal that Batman assembles a team, but the reason that he does so is so insultingly stupid that it really ruins everything that happens afterwards. Batman needs to assemble a superhero team because a big evil force is coming to destroy Earth. How does Batman find out about this threat? Because he kills a bug man and the bug man's guts leave behind a mysterious symbol that Batman conveniently recognizes as a symbol rather than just coincidence. The reason that this happens can only be described as ""Because Movie"". There is NO REASON why this would happen besides the fact that the writers needed a way for Batman to discover the impending threat and that's the best they could come up with. They needed Batman to discover the threat early and begin assembling the team. Because Movie. <br/><br/>On a related note he begins assembling the Justice League having absolutely no idea who or what he's up against and having no idea whether a team would be necessary or helpful in combating the threat. Keeping in mind that his first experience with another superhero was being distrustful and trying to kill him, assembling a team seems particularly out of character as a first resort to combat an unknown threat. It's almost like the only reason he began assembling the Justice League is because the movie is called Justice League. Because Movie. <br/><br/>It sounds like I'm really harping on this, but it's indicative of the thought process of the filmmakers. They got to the first hurdles in the plot and said ""screw it, nobody will ask questions if we cut corners right?"". So keep in mind that the ENTIRE REASON that the Justice League was assembled and exists in the first place is the result of ridiculous plot convenience. It's not even like it's the only time they do this either. Later in the film, for the sake of plot convenience, the writers basically have the villain steal something from the Justice League while they aren't paying attention even though there's no way he could've known where they were, that they had the thing he wanted, or that that particular moment would be a good opportunity to steal what he needed. <br/><br/>The villain has to collect these items and seems to have the ability to teleport to wherever these items are (like within arms length of them). It is never adequately explained that or how or why he is able to this. Also even though he has no problem doing it for the first two items for some reason he is completely incapable of doing it for the last one until it is conveniently left unguarded. Once it's unguarded he has no problem teleporting to it and stealing it which he should have been able to do before the Justice League even took possession of the item. Because Movie. <br/><br/>On a more general note this film is approximately 5% less dark and miserable and stupid than Zack Snyder's other DCEU films so hats off to Joss Whedon for his input. That being said there's still nothing fun or charming about any of the characters or about the style of the film itself. There's only so many different ways to say that it just wasn't fun. It wasn't an enjoyable experience in any way. I left the screening having felt nothing, learned nothing, and grown in no way with the characters. Nobody has an arc or learns a lesson or is bettered in any way as a result of the events of the film. <br/><br/>This lack of style and story is particularly glaring keeping in mind the close release proximity to Thor Ragnarok which oozes style and charm from every pore and actually takes the viewers on a journey of self-discovery with characters that we know and love. Everything about Justice League felt like it was done out of contractual obligation rather than love of and desire to add to the source material."

","Loved this movie! Just what a superhero movie should be, lots of great characters, lots of fantastic action, funny moments, moving moments and a villain that is a total nutter (although when I first heard his name all I could think of was ""Born to be Wild"" from that great Steppenwolf band of the 60s). There were some great scenes back on Themiscyra with the Amazons and it was so good to see Wonder Woman back in action again, she is just so good. The Flash was wonderfully portrayed by Ezra Miller, he brings heart and humour to the role. Aquaman and Cyborg were great new characters (and how ever did they do the fantastic underwater scenes??) and even Batman seemed less depressed than his last outing. But I almost leapt in the air to cheer when Superman was back, yay, my totally favourite super hero ever. And his come-back was well done, a real pivotal moment in the movie and obviously in the success or failure of the Justice League itself. Ignore all negative reviews and go and be seriously and amazingly well entertained."

","A headache. That's all this movie gave me. Knowing the problems the production went through explains the result, but still a 300 million dollar budget wasted. With this huge budget you should make something at least decent, but we got Justice League.<br/><br/>The movie looks ugly. The re-shoots are obvious and extremely shocking. Not because Whedon's style is ugly and Snyder's good looking, but because the mixture of both generates a contrast so big and noticeable it ends up being distracting.<br/><br/>Plot is non existent. Scenes just happen with no substance or reason. The villain is just a placeholder, he is a literal mcguffin looking for three mcguffins to create a bigger mcguffin.<br/><br/>The heroes are boring and uninteresting, they tried to make them likable with humor but it is poorly written as the rest of the film. Their actions and decisions are stupid and generate more problems than solutions.<br/><br/>The editing is painfully awful. Creates continuity errors and kills the passing. The final product feels incomplete, like a chain of unrelated scenes that are next to each other for some reason."

"skoloman","6","11","21","16 November 2017"," Pretty fine for a DC movie.
","This is actually a pretty decent DC movie. it's not as good as wonder woman (though not by much) JL is definitely much better than MoS or BvSDoJ. though i wasn't really hyped for this movie i was really interested in seeing it. at first it started out kind of confusingly and the worst parts of the movie are from the start, the movie gets much better the more it progresses. the villain was pretty OK. though he was the usual expendable superhero movie villain he did seem threatening at times. so let's get to the characters: most of the characters were just fine i guess. they weren't terrible nor they were super amazing. flash has some good jokes. Aquaman was really made to be cool again, cyborg was basically like a robot (pun intended) and wonder woman was mostly just like in her movie. the best character of the movie is (very surprisingly) Superman. there is a scene right after he is brought back to life when he is (kind of) evil (i think) and fighting the justice league, especially when he gets to batman... he is terrifying AF. now that obviously isn't the only reason he is the best. this time he actually has some character. he has some nice lines of dialogue and the filmmakers even tried to pay homage to Christopher reeve. in short: Superman isn't boring like in Man of Steel or Batman v Superman and for me this movie redeemed Henry Cavill. Lois lane isn't. she's still the same boring Lois lane as in BvS. she had a scene with Clark's mom and it was the worst and most boring scene in the movie. her only purpose was really to make Superman ,,not evil anymore.'' Batman was changed from BvS a little probably because people considered him boring. he does have a few funny lines but he's fine i guess. so final sentence: probably the more fun DC movie which could be better but you can enjoy it."

"capaldimark","7","10","19","15 November 2017"," A fun, thrilling adventure with some flaws
","Can DC Comics keep the momentum going after the massive critical and box office success of ""Wonder Woman""? That is a question that many would like to know the answer to, and I'm happy to say that the answer is yes.<br/><br/>Justice League is the fifth movie in the DC Extended Universe and the third directed by Zack Snyder, with some reshoots done by previous Marvel movie director, Joss Whedon. The story takes place right after the events of ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" where Batman, aka Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), inspired by Superman's selfless sacrifice to save the world (spoilers to those who have not seen BvS), runs into trouble with an unknown enemy and decides to form a group of people with superpowers to save the world from evil forces. Already having Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) on his side due to already fighting alongside her before, they must confront Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller), Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher) to convince them to fight alongside them. But they soon learn that this is not such an easy task. They don't know these people, and these people don't know them. So, predictably, there's problems and tension at first, except with Barry Allen who instantly decides to join because he claims he needs ""friends"". But they all eventually come to their senses and unite to form the Justice League, aiming to stop the evil Steppenwolf from destroying the world.<br/><br/>What's great about Justice League is its heroes. They are all great and likable, and it helps that they are brilliantly casted and have great chemistry with one another. Affleck and Gadot reprise their roles as Batman and Wonder Woman, respectively, and they're both very good. But it's the newcomers who are the most interesting, and they don't disappoint. Momoa is a natural fit for this Aquaman, Fisher brings heart to the role of Cyborg, but the true standout here is Ezra Miller as The Flash. He is what you call a ""scene stealer"". Miller has a knack for cracking jokes and his comedic timing is dead on in every scene he's in. Good times indeed. <br/><br/>The film's runtime is 2 hours, which is surprisingly short for a superhero movie these days. As a result, the movie's plot is constantly moving and there's not much down time, which keeps things entertaining. There's never really a dull moment. When there's not much action, there's interesting interaction between the heroes, and when there's no interaction, there's action. And the action scenes are well done, with each one showing what each hero's powers can do while at the same time being engaging and exciting. Not to mention the action scenes are visually thrilling, particularly the final battle.<br/><br/>Although Justice League gets a lot right, it does have its flaws. The movie has a good amount of jokes, and even though they are mostly funny, they get in the way of the movie's dramatic moments far too often. And this is the movie's main problem, it's unsure of itself. DC clearly tried to take a page from Marvel's book in terms of adding comedy to the movie, but there's such a thing as too much. There's just too many jokes that interrupt the dramatic moments in the film, and as a result these dramatic moments feel cheap. The movie doesn't really know what it wants to be, a comedic superhero movie or a more serious one. DC is known for its darker, more serious tone, and they mistakenly strayed away from that here.<br/><br/>Even though its 2 hour runtime is a good thing in some aspects, it is also a bad thing. The movie's plot constantly moves, but it almost moves a little too fast. Proper introductions to the Flash, Aquaman,and Cyborg are seemingly skipped over or are rushed and the movie as a whole feels rushed. It feels like the movie should have been a half hour longer to fully flesh out these characters. Granted there will be solo films about these heroes, but still.<br/><br/>I haven't really talked about the movie's villain much, and that's because there's not much to say about him. His name is Steppenwolf and he wants to obtain the three ""motherboxes"" so he can ultimately destroy the world. Boring.<br/><br/>All in all, Justice League is a fun, yet flawed superhero team-up movie. It gets a lot right, its heroes most importantly, but its flaws keep it from achieving greatness. And even though it's not quite as good as ""Wonder Woman"", it gets enough right to surely thrill DC diehards and casual fans alike. Booyah!"

Gal gadot is great as she was inn wonder woman and Ezra Miller I fun as flash. Whilst many are turned off about Ben affleck as batman I personally think he's potentially the best batman but he never got the script/director to back it up.

"sarastro7","5","12","24","17 November 2017"," Not bright enough, not big enough - better than feared, worse than hoped
","As a superhero fan since about 1984, and a big-time collector of superhero comics (although - full disclosure - admittedly a Marvel fan primarily), I consider myself to be in a position to judge just how successful this live action Justice League movie is. Had this come out some ten or fifteen years ago, it would have been a pretty awesome JL movie. It would have looked expensive and edgy, and most things about it would have felt fresh. Sadly, it has come out in 2017, as a too little, too late, too rushed and too cheap wanna-be movie, enormously ruined by its association with the absolutely horrible train-wreck that men call ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"". Horrified by the negative reactions to ""BvS"", JL producers (or suits, more likely) scrambled to change the planned story of this movie, basically cutting it up and throwing away the dark second half (you can check out the leaked original plot in Youtube videos), to replace it with an ill-fitting brighter second half, in which we get a much brighter and ""gooder"" Superman than we saw in ""BvS"", courtesy of Joss Whedon's frantic but disappointing attempt to save the movie via damage control. And, while I think that all the changes have probably been for the better considering what we would have gotten from the original Snyder vision, that doesn't stop this movie from feeling choppy and terribly structured, with a plot (and villain) that isn't very interesting and just amounts to a lot of time-wasting. Lots of action and explosions, but very little story or character development.<br/><br/>What chiefly dissatisfies me is that the movie just isn't cosmic enough. Why didn't they pour on the whole Darkseid thing? They should have pulled out all the stops! They are in competition with bloody Marvel Studios, which race onward with one amazing movie after the other while DC is standing still and scratching its behind. They should have gone for bigger and brighter, and poured more money into it, hiring more competent talent, especially regarding the writing. But it's DC. They do stupid things by force of habit (sorry, but they do. Many many people think so).<br/><br/>Well, at least this movie isn't a total loss. I expected the worst, but there were quite a few things in the movie I liked (and, of course, more things I disliked. Why didn't we see more of Mera?). I particularly liked Cyborg, with his alien tech that kept evolving and producing new super-tech powers for him. That was cool, especially since I felt that he would be one of the toughest characters to make work. Besides the lack of arcs and development, I didn't have problems with the other characters, but I'll emphasize that I really loved Wonder Woman. She was a total inspiration. She succeeded in giving you the feeling that she would absolutely have your back, and truly care about you all the while, whether you were an innocent bystander or a comrade in arms. She embodies all the admirable and feminine qualities of mother, sister, lover and protector, and that is a heck of an achievement. The movie is worth watching for her alone.<br/><br/>I hear that some people really like this movie, as in giving it 8 or 9 stars out of 10. Good for them. For me it was a bit of a hollow experience; something with the potential to be so much more. I rate it 6 stars out of 10, which means slightly above average, compared with other movies of its type. No classic, but conceivably something I'll want to watch again sometime. It's a shame Whedon couldn't do more to save it. Ultimately, I think they should have just redone the whole movie from scratch rather than changing it into a sort of happy zombie version of the original version. Who knows, maybe some form of the original cut will make it onto an eventual disc release. I doubt it will be better, but it will certainly be interesting."

","justice league had every chance to improve and make a good film at this point people seem to have such little faith in the film some came out of it surprised and said it was pretty good now before i get into this film one thing you should know about me is that i'm not a causal movie fan i consider myself a critic and a tough one at that i see some things most causal audiences don't see but just because i am like that doesn't mean my criticism of the film is invaded. i went into this film with a fresh mind i had no expectations what so ever people would tell me that it was fun and pretty good but going out off it i was really disappointed with the film the acting felt really wooden it seemed like everyone had a miserable time and it shows in the performances the plot of the film is non existent through out the film i couldn't understand or follow what would happen and in this film no one changed and no one grow as a person in the film and the main villain just reminded me of a forgettable marvel villain the tone felt really off too i guess with the response of batman v superman the studio panic ad turned it into this a happy goofy tone which doesn't work for dc what the studio failed to understand was the reason batman v superman failed because off the fact that the reason of conflict was stupid dc do make great dark story's but this film felt like it was just trying to rip off marvel another thing i dislike is the fact that in the film characters will have information that they should not know what so ever which makes the film all the more aggressively bad also the one another thing i noticed was that in this universe they are all supposed to feel connected but this film feels like it belongs somewhere else but not the DCEU the only thing i kind of liked was the flash i mean he does have some bad dialog but i feel if the writers had fixed some of the mistakes they made with him he would have worked a lot better but as is he is the only character i kind of cared for but that's all i can say that is good about this film. i will end with this there were some sources saying the first cut was unwatchable and if this film is a awful mess i can't imagine what the first cut of this film is like it was a shame how bad justice league was i genuinely hoped this film would be fun but it wasn't at all i guess you could say for me this film is the death of the superhero genre for me it represents everything wrong with the genre as a whole because the more i notice the more i see the superhero genre being boring predictable products but that's just my thoughts on justice league if you think this rating is unfair and you enjoy this film all i have to say is enjoy it all you want after all it's just my review of justice league"
"bak-67163","6","6","10","9 February 2020"," A little better than Batman v Superman
","First I'll start with the good about this movie. Some of the action scenes were well done. I never felt bored during the movie. The characters actually smile. Some jokes were funny. Now the bad. The Villain was one dimensional. The CGI was terrible. Batman is no longer the great fighter he was in the last movie, now he struggles to take on simple henchmen. The Justice League members that weren't Superman felt like they didn't need to be there once Superman was brought back. The worst thing of all is the fact that the Flash was a complete idiot in this movie."

"markrc-36914","9","6","10","23 November 2017"," Justice League Has It's Problems But It's Hugely Entertaining
","First of all I am a Marvel fan and DC fan, I don't have a particular favourite but I do believe DC/Warner Bros should be the number one company and not Marvel Studios, DC has Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, need I say more? they really shouldn't be in second place with the most popular/iconic characters. So as everyone knows, Justice League has been getting more than bad reviews, like many others I also don't understand why. It is only a movie after all. Enjoy it regardless of what's not good.<br/><br/>The reason this movie has been getting bad reviews is because of the weak CGI in many places/scenes, this isn't hard to spot, even because of the many re shoots that took place months after filming finished, there really shouldn't be CGI that looks ten years old and basically like your watching a video game, with a budget of £300 million you should have the best CGI possible. Another reason the movie got bad reviews is because of the film feeling rushed due to it originally being almost 3 hours long, to cut 50 or so minutes off of the run time isn't too clever as the result is every scene feeling rushed and only a few minutes long, personally I believe it needed to be two and a half hours long. I think this is the biggest negative, hopefully there will be an extended edition when released on DVD.<br/><br/>Steppenwolf isn't the worst villain of all time as many are saying, he at least has more than a few scenes where he is intimidating and threatening, okay he is your average villain who want's to take over the world but you do fear him and I believe he fits the movie just fine. Whether or not DC/WB's should have took the Loki approach from Avengers Assemble and have a human actor instead of all CGI is anyone's guess, I had no problem with the villain although it was all CGI, people who are saying they should have had the most powerful villain first, this is more a taster of things to come and gets you in the spirit of things.<br/><br/>I will say that the marketing for the movie wasn't the best, movie posters only featured 5 characters and no Superman in sight, cast interviews where the actors got told to say that Superman isn't coming back etc, I won't spoil anything for anyone who is yet to see it, not that it is a spoiler anyway but no one in this world for one second believed that DC's most iconic character would stay dead, terrible promoting in an amateur way, it might of been better to just promote Superman in your movie as he is your most iconic character.<br/><br/>The actors are spot on with their roles, you always get great performances from Gadot, Affleck and Cavill as they have played their respective roles for 3/4 times now, I don't believe there are a better three actors to play these roles and one can only hope that Affleck stays on as currently it looks like he want's out of playing Batman, also Cavill is only signed up for one more Superman appearance, either in a Man of Steel 2 or another Justice League, not sure who else you can find to play these iconic roles, Gadot is I believe signed on for a sequel to Wonder Woman and I hope she stays on for years to come, same as Affleck and Cavill. Fisher as Cyborg, Momoa as Aquaman and Miller as The Flash all have their characters down to a tea and their performances are of high standard, it really does feel as though you have known these new characters for a long time just as you have known The Avengers for the last ten years or so. You also wan't to see a solo Flash movie, a solo Cyborg movie and it makes you look forward to Aquaman being released in 2018. You don't see much of Irons as Alfred or J.K. Simmons as Commissioner Gordon but the latter hopefully will have more scenes in the sequel or the rumoured solo Batman movie, also Adams as Lois is also underused and only appears in a few scenes.<br/><br/>Lastly, as it currently stands, Justice League is struggling at the box office and a sequel looks unlikely, hopefully it keeps making as much money as possible as there is an end credit scene that potentially sets up a potentially amazing sequel, to not see that come to fruition will be a huge shame. It's going to be interesting to see what DC/WB's do next with these great characters and what direction they go in.<br/><br/>Justice League has a few problems yes, is it a perfect movie? no, but it is an immensely entertaining movie that keeps you hooked from start to finish with it's rich/iconic characters and fine actors, okay, it's your standard plot but this will not be the last time you will wan't to see The Justice League United, here's to a Justice League 2 and to hopefully an ultimate edition on DVD. DC/WB's do Justice to The Justice League."
"BatStarIndyFreak","10","6","10","18 November 2017"," Critics be damned!!
","Okay, I often like to hear what movie critics have to say, and I can't dispute their honesty as to their outlook. All I can say is that through the bulk of the movie, I was enjoying the characters, the story, and the imagery too much to remember the frequent flaws I kept hearing about. One consistent positive in all the reviews, character and character interaction, I was able to put together to find an engrossing story. The diversity of character personalities, backgrounds, and abilities made for a tough and driven Batman, compassionate and resilient WonderWoman, stubborn and find-his-own-way Aquaman, self-conscious yet grounded Cyborg, quick-witted yet angsty Flash, and finally a morally driven and also resilient Superman. <br/><br/>Steppenwolf? Loved him as a villain. Not in my top ten villains, but a worthy opponent to our heroes. along those same lines---CGI? I'll lay it all on the table, I have HUGE threshold of acceptance of it. Don't get the idea that I praise the CGI in ""Birdemic""; and any appeal found in SyFy movies' CGI hinges on how much laughter it stimulates. I draw the line below the Yetis in Mummy 3, anything of at least that quality won't take me out of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall I felt a great balance in all areas that count."

"raja-mishra7","10","6","10","18 November 2017"," Justice League- A treat for JLA followers, not for everyone!!!
","POSSIBLE SPOILER This review may be a bit biased, I am huge fan of Superman, I kinda like the Batman and love the current Wonder Woman and they have build the Aquaman, Flash characters really well. The movie could have been better, more so, because it comes right after the Thor installment which was epic entertainer. DC tries to ape the Marvel and fails. The plot is too simple, the script writing and screen play was outstanding. Superman is back... I so wanted that. They fumbled a bit in the first part, the second part was expected to be the battle, so full marks on that. The fight seemed a bit like Bahubali, too one sided for any good, except impressing the Indians. I was hoping to see a glimpse of the Green Lantern. Bruce Wayne/Batman: Full scores for uniting the team. He was mostly missed in the fight. Seemed clearly mismatched; unlike Captain America of the Marvel. Diana Prince/Wonder Woman: Full marks for being the ""leader"" she seemed to the Superhero for the longest of time in the film. Arthur Curry/Aquaman: Wasn't given as much screen space, his role seemed a bit too hurried. Barry Allen/Flash: The stuck to Barry Allen, I was thinking more on the lines of Wally West. Was probably the only superhero who got a good intro and did the bit of comedy. Cyborg: His role was pivotal, but he did not impress as much. Cyborg in today's day and time is an outdated customer. A funnier Green Lantern or the Beetle would be a better option. Superman: I so went to see his resurrection and it was hurried too. Some how Synder did not know to take it forward the Nolan way. Steppenwolf: Comes as a character buried too far in past to be suddenly resurrected and summoned for battle. But it was quite a match for the team. All in all, this is two 2 hours movies, stuffed into one, and instead of making it entertaining, it made things hurried and flat. The think tank is too impressed by the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which started long back, has a better road-map. It is advised that they take their own somber way, as we all associate the DC with. What makes things worse is that, they are doing this before they introduce the superheroes to the third world, which is getting Marvel the returns. Also they need to expand their superhero-skill base as well as Super-villain skill base. Lex Luthor and Slade Wilson is too old school to be of any good, more so when Deadpool is the star of the time. They also have to rethink about their uni- dimensional superheroes... the world today sees things in gray shades... Shazam seems to be a promise. Despite everything, I will go and watch the film again, just to see the Justice League Assemble. It is way more emotionally motivating for me than the Avenger chronicles. WAIT TILL THE END CREDITS, THERE ARE TWO LONG POST-CREDIT TEASERS."

","they make the same exact mistakes again and again. obviously dc don't possess the patience and the foresight to do what needs to be done for a franchise like this to be successful. instead of letting the cinematic universe grow organically and giving people a chance to get interested in and care about the characters they just dump everything in your lap and demand that you accept everything and care - it's just not possible.<br/><br/>the plot felt incredibly rushed and clichéd in a very.. not self aware way. instead of (if clichéd is the way they want to go) owning it there's this uncomfortable vibe that they think they're so cool and gritty and different when they're really not. <br/><br/>character introductions failed, personally I think Affleck as batman is terrible, the villain was incredibly poorly fleshed out and a poor work of cgi that just screamed about ""destroying the world mohahah"" without any clear motifs. Affleck is the only casting i have a real problem with, though i feel like the writing did Ezra Miller a real disservice in the way that every thing he said and did felt like it was forcibly supposed to show Barry Allen/the flash' personality. <br/><br/>the only + that comes to mind is the scene in which the amazons try do keep the box thing away from the villain, that was pretty cool. in all honesty i cringed a lot throughout the movie, the dialogue felt very stilted and the jump from strangers to ""we're a team, a family!!"" laughable. <br/><br/>disappointed but not all that surprised."

"Damien_King86","6","5","8","19 November 2017"," Borrowing some Marvel Magic, Justice League is a homerun for DC.
","To address the Marvel V DC issue, my perspective is that Marvel has always been consistently very good, but DC has had higher highs and lower lows (within the films and across the franchise). <br/><br/>Justice League is one long high, cinematically speaking. <br/><br/>The film has all the best hallmarks of Zack Snyder -- the cinematography, the symbolism, the action, but it's been tidied up with some of Joss Whedon's little humor moments, and although I'm not at all a Joss fanboy, I think the marriage of the two filmmakers' styles does the film...justice. <br/><br/>The ensemble comes together a little hastily in this story, which has been DC's main weak link until now, but considering how Warner Bros. has not allowed the series the time to flesh each character out before joining up, they newcomers (Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg) get introduced rather quickly, but it's OK because their backstories are hinted at enough to be interesting to casual filmgoers, but comic fans already know what they are about. <br/><br/>Steppenwolf is your typical comic movie villain -- except with Ciaran Hind's voice acting lends him a kind of stage-play gravitas that works well for the character. <br/><br/>A few other points: Wonder Woman continues to be a highlight of the series both visually and narratively, Snyder's Superman is ultimately badass (sorry Donner fans), Jason Momoa nails it as Aquaman, I had a hard time letting go of the CW Flash but Ezra Miller made me forget it. <br/><br/>To summarize, Justice League was an awesome superhero film -- one that is as good as anything Marvel has done. I only hope there will be an extended version because I suspect it would be even better than it already is."

Story - Although you don't expect something new or a very solid story in superhero movies but still JL's story is pretty average. Origin of JL where iconic characters meet and form the famous Justice League deserves a better story than this.<br/><br/>2. The buildup is lengthy and a bit slow, and, the execution and climax is too short. It's like you wait and wait, and in the blink of an eye, it's over.<br/><br/>3. Aquaman is still a joke. Jason Momoa looks good but the character is too weak.<br/><br/>4. Not so good fight scenes and special effects.<br/><br/>5. Poor character development- It's like everyone is in hurry.

","Don't worry, it's not a joke fest but the lighter tone certainly works better than that dark nonsense. Still the same cherry picking from the source but no way as bad as BvS. It's New 52 but with more focus. The CGI is excessive at times and the individual story arcs are forced at times. <br/><br/>There are some pleasant surprises. The trailers did a good job of not giving much away. Now as a comic book fan I do have to Nit-pick some of the deviations. One was horrible. I won't mention which one but it was bad but doesn't hurt the overall theme. There is a heavy Avengers influence, which isn't a bad thing but DC needs to reach into their own source and adapt Barry and Cyborg much better. Jason Momoa steals the show, along with Wonder Woman who is currently DCEU'S best character. My only issue is they power her down in this, which really bothered me. Team doesn't mean the members need one person to save them, they are all supposed to be as powerful as the other and together they can take care of any threat. But to an extent it was fan service so I fully understand why Zack and Chris Terrio wrote this film the way that they did.<br/><br/>Not bad at all and not too dark for the kids.

"Artist_TRS","8","3","4","21 January 2020"," Not a Total Injustice
","Everyone is aware of the troubled Warner Bros. Dr. Frankenstein stitched mess production of 2017's ""Justice League"", most notably its crude reshoots before theatrical release, but does that mean it's unredeemable in any way? That it's unwatchable? I firmly believe no. It's fun and satisfying for what it is. Especially as an avid fan and reader of its source comic characters (seemingly the movie taking modernized inspiration from Justice League #1-6 of the New 52) there's a base level of contentment within my heart to have the privilege of witnessing these beloved characters in live-action interact together for a historical first time on the big screen; generations before us could only dream of the movie experiences we have now. I personally feel being overly critical, smashing things into oblivion perhaps is too serious and pompous in the modern world when it comes to our entertainment; whatever happened to watching a movie just for the fun of it? Justice League should be that unhindered fun. Let's dig into it...<br/><br/>To briefly summarize its plot, the movie depicts Batman and Wonder Woman recruiting the Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman to save the world after collectively resurrecting Superman from death to defeat Steppenwolf and his army of Parademons attempting to cause apocalyptic ruination of the Earth.<br/><br/>The performances of the entire cast of the Justice League were superb; no heroes or heroine eclipsing another. Interactions and bickering amongst the team had a charm that felt natural and was often times humorous. The costumes for all the characters were faithful to the comic book counterparts but have been designed with fresh stylishness. Ciarán Hinds who provided his distinctive voice for the CGI villain Steppenwolf was menacingly unsettling; equally superb as the cast of the League. Some criticism has been aimed at the CGI of Steppenwolf, but I thought the formidable presence of the character was rendered believably well.<br/><br/>The action scenes of this movie are a pleasure to watch and were choreographed beautifully. The cinematography is stunning to look at and are composed with as much artistry and sensibility as panels of a comic book. Whether it's Batman perched on a gargoyle, or Wonder Woman's motion blur deflecting streams of bullets with her gauntlets, it looks awesome. One visually conspicuous and unfortunately negative aspect of the movie though, is the CGI edited upper lip region of Superman (Henry Cavill) due to the actor's moustache present during this movie's infamous reshoots; it's embarrassingly uncanny valley at times whenever on screen.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would recommend 2017's ""Justice League"" to the forefront most unwavering of DC fans primarily, and then to any other audience member not going into the viewing of the movie too seriously or self-entitled like I previously mentioned. Nothing is truly perfect to satisfy everybody. Sure, this movie had a troubled production and it shows with shoddy reshoots so obviously noticeable in the scenes they are in, but hey, this movie's production evolved as it did; it happened - accept the reality. But despite it all, I'm still unwaveringly content for what we got to experience as it is. Enjoyment from this movie is possible if your only intent is to have a fun time and see the Justice League historically united in live-action. For that it's awesome; mission accomplished."

","I waited along time to see this movie due to all the negative buzz. Also, I hated Man of Steel and Batman V. Superman and I wasn't impressed with Zack Snyder. I think the reason I liked it may have been because of Josh Whedon's fixes to it probably. But I came into this film totally expecting to hate it. I didn't think Steppenwolf was the best villain, but I loved the pacing, the humor and the way they humanized Superman in this movie...he wasn't Superman in Snyder's Man of Steel and in this movie Cavill's Superman has been redeemed. I thought Wonder Woman was fantastic and stole the show. Gal Gadot was so so good and she alone is worth watching as Wonder Woman.After seeing all the negative reviews, I can't help thinking that either the negatives are from 1) Marvel fans who don't like DC or 2) from people like me who hated Zack Snyder's previous attempts at making a DCU movie. I think Joss Whedon probably saved Justice League and I honestly don't understand how the horrible trash that is the Last Jedi has 7.4,but this film rates a 6.6. Weird! I thought this was a very fun film and although it isn't the best film ever, it is a very good movie in my opinion."

"chucho_scream","8","3","4","5 June 2018"," In a world of Cinematic Universes arrives Justice League
","This review could have been written in 2 ways: 1. Evaluating the movie as a stand alone movie 2. Considering the now many cinematic universes, this one part of DC Universe, started with Fox X Men Universe and consolidated and ruled nowadays by Disney and Marvel. I think the 2nd way is more fun... Only if you live in a cave underground it is inevitable that you have not seen or heard about any movie of the MCU.<br/><br/>I will start saying: I really liked this movie. Ok, Marvel has done a fantastic job making some heroes more familiar that were not familiar and building the only true solid cinematic universe, they have taken their time and celebrated the 10 Anniversary of that universe with an epic movie...But let's face it:
DC has great super heroes, many of us grew up with their cartoons, comic books, movies or tv series, and watching them together in a movie is one good reason to see this movie.<br/><br/>Is Justice League funny? Yes. Is there chemistry within the actors? Yes. Are the battles and special effects good? Yes. Did all the Justice League members shined the same? No. Was the release of the movie a little bit rushed? Maybe. I will not get into the synopsis. Let's talk about some aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>The rhythm is good, I did not get bored at any time. Maybe with Man of Steel, Batman VS Superman, and even with Wonder Woman there were some slow paced scenes. But Justice League is fast paced and funny, all the time we get something new and fresh.<br/><br/>The Justice League Team: I think the main challenge was to get all the heroes together and make it in a credible and, at the same time, not in a boring way. For some that are more familiar to this super heroes (at comics, cartoons or their previous movie and TV series incarnations) it would not be a problem, but maybe for new generations, now adapted to Marvel Movies and being used to be presented each member at their own movie, seeing all this heroes together maybe is not that magical. But personally, and for the most familiar with them, I do think that you get to see chemistry within the team, and seeing them working together with their different abilities gives a lot of fun to the movie and some good action sequences. Now, let's talk about the members:<br/><br/>1st we get to see Wonder Woman / Gal Gadott. She had her successful and, in my point of view, very good stand alone movie. It is good to see some hints about her previous installment and also see a more mature character (there is gap of almost 100 years between the movies) that now has to come out of exile to save the world.<br/><br/>
Batman: I think Ben Affleck's Batman is fine, maybe we haven't seen a lot from him and sometimes it feels that he is out of place. I mean, in the movie they say that he has been Batman for 20 years, we know, from B VS S, that the 1st Robin died but we never get to see that on screen, so sometimes is difficult to consider him as a full character. But in a way it is understandable considering all the portraits that we have had from Batman all over the years (live action movies and TV series, cartoon, lego-lized, etc). To present Batman's origins again would be too much. So, if you relax and remember that no matter the actor, you know the story of the Dark Knight, then you can sit and relax. Something I appreciated a lot was to hear again Danny Elfman's Batman theme, from Tim Burton´s movies.<br/><br/>We have Flash and Cyborg, the younger crew of the team. I think Flash, Ezra Miller was fantastic, very funny and nerdy, a very likable character. He works like the new Spider-Man Tom Holland for the Avengers but, I think he fits even better. Cyborg, Ray Fisher, was pretty good too, great special effects with his suit and powers. And watching a half human half robot boy dealing with all his changes is presented in a fast but credible way. The movie delivers some back story of both characters in a way that you get to know them and not getting bored in the way.<br/><br/>I have some complains with Aquaman. Although Jason Momoa does a good job and his look is fine, I do not think he really shined at any moment. There are some good effects underwater, but we never really get to see his powers used in some epic heroic battle. I know that there will be his own movie, but his introduction could have been better in this one.<br/><br/>And Superman, Henry Cavill - spoilers, if they are not obvious enough- Yes we have him coming back. I thought his ""Resurrection"" was going to be more epic, but it was not that bad seeing him all confused battling with the Justice League. Now we have the Man of Steel with all his powers, coming back, he is again the boy scout. I thought we would become a darker character, but that is just me. Also, we never get to see what happens outside the world, what do they think about him. Super heroes seem to be in an alternate world aside, something that is happening too to the Marvel Movies, the ""Real World"" is starting to feel more alienated each time.<br/><br/>Amy Adams and Diane Lane are back and have some moments with Superman but I think their characters are not that well developed, and maybe they don't even need to. The producers could have saved some money, or invest it better, and put other actresses in that roles. But I do not think Hollywood has a money$$$ problem at all!<br/><br/>
The villain, Steppenwolf, - spoilers again - his motives and the Boxes of Power that he is seeking... Impossible not to compare it with the gems from the Avengers. Yeah, it is almost the same and yes, this is where the movie seems rushed and not that well developed. We are introduced to this boxes that even try to connect the stories of our characters. Was it a bad resource? No, just it proves that the DC Universe was built trying to have the success of Marvel's Avengers. I just hope, that now DC realizes that they have the best super heroes (yes Marvel, I am sorry. Maybe Spiderman...) and that DC can do good movies with their own formula (Bravo Wonder Woman and even Justice League in some way, Please burry Suicide Squad and Man of Steel).<br/><br/>In the end, Justice League is a fun movie, with a good team, good chemistry between actors and some good actions sequences. I would definitely recommend it and watch it again. 8 /10"
"magus-4","8","3","4","14 April 2018"," Enjoyable watch
","It's hard to understand the 1,2, 3 ratings. I guess some people are in a binary state of mind when it comes to reviewing and it's either love or hate. I mean, some flaws in a movie, book, tv-show, or people for that matter don't make them a 100% bad. 
I'm not a purist, certainly when it comes to fantasy, mythology, superheroes, or anything that comes from our imagination. I actually like the playing around with it, exploring different universes of thought. And of course that always goes hand in hand with some mistakes. It's the price of admission for any creative process.
I think this movie is a solid good action flick. The character development is either non existent or very straightforward, the story is much less confusing and complex than Batman V Superman. There's a lot of smiles, and I even found myself laughing out loud at some moments (Flash). Superman and Batman are far less intense which is nice. I liked the screen time everyone got. There's plenty of action. I liked the visual effects. <br/><br/>The end credit scenes included a funny scene as well as a pointer to a possible next movie.
So if you like to be entertained and like action movies: Have some snacks, sit back and you'll have a nice couple of hours."

The Flash would have been the comedy relief if it weren't for everyone else having their share of levity. <br/><br/>I was really surprised that I liked Aquaman as much as I did and even Cyborg was really cool. You care about every character in this movie and hope they all make it through in the end. <br/><br/>Steppenwolf was definitely a surprise. When I heard the moans and groans regarding a CGI villain, I paused and lost interest in wanting to see this. Man, was I wrong. He's a great villain! He's a big baddy that wants to destroy the world and he's pretty vicious! Maybe I enjoyed him because I'm not naive enough to think that a villain needs some other reason to do evil things to than he's just fricking evil! <br/><br/>Maybe these critics wanted to see the villain whine and pine about how someone stole his milk when he was 3 or about how his mother forced him to watch Oprah against his will or whatever. Who knows with those film critics. Guys, they did the bad guy right with this one and that's all there is to it. <br/><br/>When it comes to the big baddy, stick to the basics. After all, we don't want a repeat of Jesse Eisenburg's Lex Luthor do we?<br/><br/>The plot: <br/><br/>A bunch of zombie like flying creatures that are attracted to fear show up in Gotham. Batman investigates and comes to realize the world is being threatened. He then begins to seek out and recruit(with the help of Wonder Woman) Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg to help save our world. <br/><br/>In closing, ignore the wannabe critics, grab some popcorn, and just enjoy the fricking movie.

"drkable","9","3","4","5 March 2018"," Near perfect hero-flick
","I can't understand the heavy critique this movie has garnered. Both critics and fans alike seem to dislike it. I on the other hand found it to be a much more well-formulated superhero movie, that goes to show that they don't all have to have a bunch of humorous sidekicks that and tongue-in-cheek sensibillity.
Batman: Ben Affleck delivers a more than solid performance as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. 
Wonder Woman: Doesn't fill out the whole movie, and actually makes sense in a strategic way this time around. I really am warming up to Gal Gadot's rendition.
The Flash: Steals the movie with his aspergian take on the character. 
Cyborg: Gets more space this time, and is vital to the story.
Superman: I like how he's pulled back into the story. I'm glad we didn't have to watch a lot of backstory on that one. That would've dragged out the whole storyline.
Alfred: I really love Jeremy Irons' Alfred. Sophisticated and sly. Even if it's fusing Lucious Fox and Alfred Pennyworth into the same character. 
Zack Snyder has done real well, and I think pulling on Joss Whedon was a good call. I wonder how much he affected the tone of the film. 
Can't wait for the next installment!"

"niallmaggs","9","3","4","5 January 2018"," Very decent DCEU film! - Film Review By Niall Maggs (http://ateenstakeonfilm.com)
","If I had to describe Justice League in one word, that one word would be 'awesome'. Somehow I don't think that one word will be enough for a full-length film review, but that was what I, and most of the audience, was thinking for the entire runtime. Justice League is tons of fun, with a light and laid back tone to it, unlike previous DCEU entries. <br/><br/>The overall plot is a continuation of Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice, following the events of the film. Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) wants to put together a team with the help of Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, in what will be and already is her iconic performance as Wonder Woman. They both target The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and, hopefully, Superman (Henry Cavill) to form the Justice League, and stop an evil force led by the fan favourite villain Steppenwolf, played eerily by CiarÃ¡n Hinds. <br/><br/>After the poor reception of Batman V. Superman and Suicide Squad, DC were hoping for a beacon of light to appear, this was the excellent Wonder Woman directed by Patty Jenkins; for the second time, the DCEU have released another entertaining follow up that will restore the fans faith in Warner Bros. and the DC Extended Universe, and may finally create some competition between them and Marvel.<br/><br/>The introduction of the iconic characters that make up the universe was short and sweet, but got the job done with a reasonably short runtime of just two hours. The action is non stop from beginning to end, with great humour and dialogue that put a smile on my face throughout. The comic relief is evidently The Flash, with embarrassingly nerdy lines that suit the character perfectly. The only main character that isn't explored satisfyingly enough is Cyborg. Little of his past is explained and your left feeling no more attached to him than when you first heard of him. The character is also quite dull and doesn't stand out when competing with others like Batman and Wonder Woman!
Considering there was direction from both Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon, the film's pace and tone stay consistent, and the story remains coherent and understandable.<br/><br/>However the film suffers from a painfully weak villain that just feels like a throwaway character, and one that is very forgettable and is by no means chilling or spine tingling, unlike the comic version.
Regardless of the frustrating flaws that stand out, Justice League is everything you would want it to be with resonating heroes and their relatable issues. Non-stop entertainment and fun is exactly what a superhero film should be, and that is exactly what Justice League is."
"ravenhair702","10","3","4","31 December 2017"," Fantastic movie!!
","I've watched this movie 3 times and I just loved every moment of it! The critics can kiss every square inch of my butt. It has humor, action, romantic moments and feeling. Now...I'm not a CGI expert like nxkr...a fellow reviewer to IMDB...who gave this much anticipated movie a 1. Wow. Harsh enough? I get the feeling that most people are comparing this movie to The Avengers. I'll admit that Marvel did it right by giving each of it's heroes their own movie before they all came together as a team, but that doesn't take away how this is STILL an awesome movie. Can't wait till it comes out on DVD and frankly...I'll never get tired of watching it. I highly recommend it."
"charlesj-19419","9","3","4","29 December 2017"," Yup. Screw the critics
","I liked and enjoyed it.
It must have been a phase I went through: we all have small secret shames. One of mine is that as a 30-something, I got into the Justice League and JLU animated series. I still think there are great individual episodes in those series, as well as some great story arcs. So I was actually excited, when there were distant rumours of a JL movie. That excitement was worn down and all but forgotten by the negative response to the films that built up to this. They weren't necessarily great, but their biggest failing was that they fell into the shadow of the Marvel machine; the movies were less epic, less all-encompassing, and the PR couldn't compete. 
So instead of hunting out a seat in the first weekend or even the first week, I undertook watching this as a (slightly hopeful) chore, but I was so relieved.
The film had a lightness I can't necessarily explain; it felt familiar and authentic. It had qualities of superhero stories that felt like reading the comics and watching the cartoons, almost as if maybe it cared for the audience. Crazy huh. For whatever the glitz and drama of the Marvel movies, they are perhaps more than a little self-involved.
The cast did a great job. Aquaman was introduced really well and Jason Momoa was cast really well. Ben Affleck's Batman isn't the same one as all the others. I thought he was more real, more believable, just better all round. A much-needed change. Lego Batman he is not. Wonder Woman and the Flash brought all that those characters are supposed to bring and did it v.well.
All those years ago when there were rumours of a JL film, I would've expected it to have been epic. Now, I was relieved it wasn't. It was just very good. (Yay, Justice League!)"

","This is a fun popcorn movie for people who know the characters. As a father of two young boys who has spent countless hours watching Justice League animated features, this was a pretty faithful rendering of that world as live action.<br/><br/>It is by no means perfect. The CGI is ropey at times, which was surprising and there is no getting past the mustache unfortunately. However it's not as distracting as some people think and as portrayed by some of the photoshopped versions spread by hate-mongers. The music score, if you can call it that, is very weak indeed and is just a bunch of generic orchestral incidental sounds interspersed with Elfman's Batman theme and a single moment where we hear John William's Superman theme. There actually isn't anywhere near as much action as in previous DC films, which is a shame, as this is one movie where the characters deserved to show off more, especially Flash and Cyborg. The villain is weak and we didn't get any sense of his motivation.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent, chemistry and dialogue between them is charged and fun. Whedon's reworking of the script clearly shows. What action we do get is well choreographed and photographed. The movie starts in darkness and ends in hope, leaving you feeling quite positive about the future of JL and future additions to its ranks. One hopes they can keep the cast together for further stories and that the studio has the sense to give the next instalment to Whedon from the beginning."

As you might aware or not, you can't trust any sites that collect anonym's rate as your preferences anymore.<br/><br/>This movie is far from superior, or at the same level with the dark knight. Because what? it's a superheroes movie. You came to theater just to watch your childhood superhero unleash their powers. You dont want a complex plot, because it's not meant for drama or story-driven movie, just pact of actions. <br/><br/>But nowadays, you can't see how bad the scores can be given, if it's a DC franchise. Marvel use the same pattern (heroes prologue, enemy appears, fight, heroes win) but DC experienced less favors when rating comes. Im not in position to have a grudge with Marvel franchise (as i enjoyed some of their franchise too). Have you watch Deadpool, Ironman series,Thor and Avengers: age of ultron?

","I am all for brooding and dark. If it were me, the DC Universe movies and series would all be rated R. Yet, I also need to have fun and this is kind of what Justice League was. It's two hours long, but the actual fight with evil is in the last 15 minutes and almost inconsequential. The dynamic between the characters, in the end, is why the movie is worth watching. And, spoiler, Superman's not dead... he's just ridiculously overpowered, which makes the entire League concept kind of pointless. That's where the fun comes in. Go watch the film, turn your brain off a little, and enjoy. The true depth of the Justice League concept can never be reached in any type of movie. You have comic books and animations for that.<br/><br/> Now, Cyborg was awesome. In this digital age he might even be overpowered himself, but his character wasn't truly explored. Aquaman looked good, but for the life of me couldn't see his point. The Superman/Batman/Wonder Woman trio worked great, as it did in the movie before (quit whining and watch the extended version). That leaves Barry Allen, who was kind of fun. There are holes in the logic of... well, everything, but I reiterate: fun!"

Perhaps because it had TV shows bolsetering it and animated movies as well, but DC had those things too. In general The Marvel Universe has just been portrayed with a better cast and perhaps a better budget and had the amazing Joss Whedon (who had to step in and help finisht Justice League for Zack Snyder. I would love to know how much affect Joss had on this project. Had he not ultimately been involved, would this movie have suffered? Joss is great all the way back to Firefly and Serenity but his crowning achievement was the first Avengers movie. <br/><br/>I think DC got lucky with Whedon because it was hard tying in all those storylines and making a convincing villain. And Steppenwolf was LAME! Perhaps Joss couln't fix the entire movie but it had an script that was made before he stepped in. I guess you can only polish something so much when its not your own!"
"pal05052003","7","3","4","19 November 2017"," Batman and Wonder Woman recruit several other superheroes to fight a new threat to the Earth after the death of Superman
","A very light, and entertaining movie indeed. The CGI and lighting may be distracting at times, but these flaws do not take away much from the movie. Ezra Miller's Flash was the comic relief, Jason Momoa's Aquaman was the tough guy, while Ray Fisher's Cyborg provided the tragic part. In this installment, Ben Affleck's Batman and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman are the key characters and they provide a motive for the story. The only flaw to the movie is that although every hero is interesting, we do not get time to be too invested in them. However, this flaw is compensated by the numerous fight scenes. One interesting battle the the underwater fight scene featuring Aquaman (no spoilers here; since we are talking about Aquaman there is bound to be a water fighting scene). In fact, this movie focuses on the heroes, and when the team gets together, that is where all the cool action starts. The pacing may seem uneven, and the movie felt a bit short but you will leave the theater feeling great. Highly recommended for anyone needing light superhero fun."
"bodhi-13262","6","3","4","17 November 2017"," Give me 'Justice' or give me death.
","The long awaited live-action DC Superhero team-up we have all been waiting for has arrived. 'Justice League' brings our favorite heroes together, but does the film come together as well as the team does?<br/><br/>1. When an intergalactic foe (Steppenwolf) threatens all life on Earth, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) reunites with Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) to assemble heroes from every corner to defend the world. With 'Justice League' being the 5th installment in the DC Universe, this movie undeniably feels a little rushed although it does have the appearance of a stand-alone film. It is quite obvious that DC and Warner Bros. are trying their hand at reverse engineering these characters by introducing them in one big ensemble and then gradually branching them off into their respective films. Is this DC's best movie? Not at all, but it's far from their worst.<br/><br/>2. One the positive side, Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) is the most prominent character in the film more so than anyone else. If there's one person that gives life to this film.....it's her. The quiet moments between Gadot and Affleck (Batman) are by far the most interesting. There is a conflict between them in a sense of a love/hate relationship which hints at a possible budding romance. The other standout character was surprisingly Ray Fisher as Victor Stone/Cyborg. Maybe it's just me, but characters struggling to regain humanity that was stripped of them always resonates with me and Cyborg is just that. The least interesting member of the league however, is Ezra Miller as Barry Allen/The Flash. He clearly serves as the comic relief but he had more misses than hits. Most of his one-liners fall flat and the ones that do get nothing more than a chuckle.<br/><br/>3. The one person I wanted and expected more of was Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman. Momoa obviously has fun with the role but never quite proves himself to be the badass we know him as from the comics. For someone with super-strength and command of the seas, his range is limited mainly because of the script. I'm certain 'justice' will be done to his character in his upcoming solo film, but I was disappointed that he wasn't as engaged as he should be. Not to spoil anything or explain what takes place, but the brief moments we get of Henry Cavill in the film, he finally proves himself as the Superman fans love. Probably the best set-piece in the film involves him about half-way into the movie. That sequence in particular was far more exciting and thrilling than the climax.<br/><br/>4. Every moment in which all the league members communicate and talk amongst each other is where the movie succeeds. Despite being the only human of the team, Ben Affleck holds his own and works best in every scene he has with Gal Gadot. Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf is about as underwhelming as they come. Never is his ultimate plan thoroughly fleshed out nor his objective justified. All he serves as is just a plot device and a reason for there to be a 'Justice League'. The film drops Easter-eggs every so often including two post-credit scenes. If you can manage to be patient, the scene at the very end (not spoiling anything) hints at the possibility of the solo 'Batman' film (starring Ben Affleck) that everyone has been waiting for.<br/><br/>The scenes directed by Snyder, opposed to the re-shoots by Joss Whedon, are as knight and day. Not saying that's a bad thing, but the film feels very choppy without a proper flow. I wasn't bored but nether was I even mildly entertained. 'Justice League' is by far better than 'Suicide Squad', but until it establishes a stronger script, pacing and less over-the-top CGI action, it will not succeed at matching the standard of MARVEL."

"guntherguy","9","4","6","14 July 2019"," Honestly!
","There was a lot of differing opinion around this movie ranging from excellent to terrible and I can see both sides. Honestly, I believe it's a great movie that shows it's flaws but wears them on its sleeves.
Good: Ben Afflecks' Batman is always a highlight and brings to life the older and grittier Batman I never knew a cinematic movie needed. Gal Gadot is now a staple of DC and is very enjoyable, really that can be said for the entire cast of memorable portrayals. The story is actually very nicely thought through and does a good job of setting up this version of the Justice League- if only we could see the stand-alone movies starring the Flash and Cyborg. We get very solid character interactions and some great development from key players that deepen their characters for sure. Most of the vfx are immersive and work incredibly well with the shape and feel of the narrative while being very convincing in execution, honestly there's a lot to love about Justice League<br/><br/>Bad: First-off is the reshoots helmed by Whedon - who thought of bringing back an actor late in development from another movie and rendering the hardest part of anatomy? Steppenwolf is a bit one-note and really is a big cgi villain. The Unity aspect should not be a terraformer, but the key to bringing Darkseid onto our world, this would've set up the next movie (if only) and back up the characters name drop early in and made it meaningful. Some pacing may be a bit brisk in some places and could have done with a better transition into the more intimate character moments.<br/><br/>I hope this helps with explaining a lot about this movie and lay out why I feel it deserves better, unfortunately it seems as though another Justice League is off the table for a while, but for now we have a perfectly watchable and very solid film to sit and enjoy!"
"hh-94450","8","4","6","5 November 2018"," After Wonder Woman, best DC movie so far
","I'm adding my review so that I can boost Justice League ahead of Batman vs Superman. The two movies aren't in the same league (no pun intended). In both movies Superman comes across as a sensitive new age guy. Hardly the 'Man of Steel'. DC needs to seriously rethink this character as well as the previously feisty Lois Lane who's now a sugar puff. However, in Justice League Batman gets an overhaul. No longer the deeply troubled troublemaker in need of a shrink, Batman is now funny and proactive - and still a bit disturbed. Wonder Woman dominated her own movie and she stands out in this one. Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman fill out the ensemble cast. Not the best movie ever made, but so much better than Batman vs Superman."

","Are bots doing reviews these days? One has to wonder when you see the avalanche of 9s/10s for Justice League.<br/><br/>It's an okay movie at best but a 8/9/10 is just rigged or retarded.<br/><br/>The good news about Justice League is that the DC guys are finally getting it. Tone down on the darn stuff and lighten things up.<br/><br/>The bad news is the characters are still far from being fleshed out to make us really care. (We felt sad when even Loki got stabbed and he is a baddie!) <br/><br/>Every scene Affleck's Batman is in feels like he just apologised for groping that reporter - he is so out of it. Wonder Woman is one-dimensional and does more posing than acting. Aquaman was never interesting as a comic book so poor Jason Momoa has to dial up the boozy BS to give him some 'character'. Cyborg...yawn. And the CGI...it is just terrible given the state of technology these days. Come on guys, you pinched Joss Whedon, go get the Disney contacts for CGI! <br/><br/>Tha Flash and Superman are the two savings graces in Justice League. And their showdown scene is everything DC can build on - humanity with a light touch that we all want to see more of."
"jonas-26311","10","4","6","19 November 2017"," Go in with an open mind and try to enjoy this good movie
","I had high hopes but low expectations but I ended up really liking it. It was a funny movie with great chemistry in the league with perfect individual character building to set up future standalone movies. Seeing Wonder woman and Batman again on how they have changed to the more optimistic side since BvS was lovely. Aquaman was a solid character and really looking forward to his film 2018 in December. For Cyborg, there is much more I would love to see in his own film. Flash was this really down to earth, funny and excited kid. I would probably be the same if i were in his shoes. The story overall was okey and it stuck to that one story, not millions of other plots. Steppenwolf was OK, not bad not great. Just a regular villain with one purpose. Really liked all the different environments, like Atlantis, Themyscira, Gotham, Batcave and Kents farm. The only thing a can really complain about is probably the CGI but otherwise i really recommend you to watch this movie. The mid credit scene was hilarious and the end credit scene was just amazing. Make sure to stay till the end AND OMG THIS IS THE SUPERMAN WE ALL WANTED TO SEE. BEST PART OF THE MOVIE HANDS DOWN. He WAS hope,justice, joy and an inspiration to the league."
"themadmovieman","7","4","6","19 November 2017"," It's okay, but if DC is going to improve, then it needs to drop Snyder's drab style
","It seems that DC just can't hit the mark spot on. While Wonder Woman proved a very entertaining success, Justice League represents a step backwards in the DC Extended Universe. Although it is a fairly fun blockbuster, and a small improvement on the messy Batman v Superman, it's still a clunky, visually ugly and poorly directed superhero movie that just feels like it's trying too hard, all of which makes for a rather frustrating watch at times.<br/><br/>However, we'll start with the positives, and one of the things that I enjoyed most about Justice League was the team dynamic between the lead heroes. Although character depth in each individual superhero is severely lacking, which means their back stories are less than riveting to watch, the six of them are all actually a lot of fun to watch working together.<br/><br/>In similar fashion to how The Avengers introduced us to the team, Justice League pits a whole bunch of clashing personalities into one team and forces them to work together. However, rather than seeing any bickering, the personality clashes between individuals make for a few good laughs throughout, while the range of powers and abilities is generally split well between the group, although there are times when it seems as if Superman is insanely overpowered in comparison to his colleagues.<br/><br/>In general, however, the Justice League all work well together, which is great fun to see. And another reason that that's the case is because the performances here are all pretty strong. Despite the likes of Henry Cavill and Amy Adams being somewhat absent from the story as a whole, Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa and especially Ezra Miller are all really entertaining action heroes, bringing good charisma to their roles and having excellent chemistry with one another, adding to the successful team dynamic of the film as a whole.<br/><br/>When it comes to the story, however, things start to take a turn for the worse. On the one hand, the plot is a marked improvement on Batman v Superman. While that film was insanely overstuffed with up to six different story lines, Justice League is a lot more streamlined, and as such doesn't feel anywhere near as messy or poorly thought out, which means it's definitely an easier and lighter film to sit back and watch.<br/><br/>However, that simpler side to the story is also where this film falls down. Although it's by no means as empty and dull as Suicide Squad, it feels very basic and clunky throughout. Starting with a very formulaic opening act where we see the backstories of a couple of new characters before they join the Justice League, things feel a little too simple and generic, with no real passion or excitement coming from any of the developments in the film's first third.<br/><br/>The second act is better, and with the team working together in a few action sequences, it's a simple and entertaining watch, getting closer to what Wonder Woman did so well with a streamlined blockbuster plot. The third act, however, is a bit of a mess, partly due to the generic save the world climax, as well as Superman's clear excessive power, to the point where he could arguably do everything on his own, but also because it's an absolute visual nightmare.<br/><br/>And that's where we come onto the film's worst point: the directing. I wasn't a fan of Zack Snyder's darker style in Man Of Steel or Batman v Superman, but at those times I felt if he developed it and stuck to it a little more, the DC Extended Universe could work well as its own, slightly more serious alternative to the bright and happy world of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>However, the failings of Justice League all point to the fact that it seems like Zack Snyder's persistence hasn't paid off. The film's visually disgusting finale is key evidence for this, as although it embraces the more fun-loving blockbuster vibes that made Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman so entertaining, the ugly CGI and bleak brown, grey and orange colour pallete really makes it unpleasant to look at, and it all looks an absolute mess of dullness, surely not what you want to see from a comic book movie.<br/><br/>What's more is that it seems as if these characters all do work better in a brighter, more comedic light. Again, we've seen Wonder Woman work well in that, but with the excellent comic relief of The Flash in this film, and the general strong chemistry between the team members in the lighter-hearted scenes, it's clear that the darker, duller vibes just aren't the way forward, and if DC really wants to see their universe survive against the unstoppable force of Marvel, then it has to embrace a lighter atmosphere and visual pallete more akin to what Wonder Woman pulled off earlier this year.<br/><br/>Overall, Justice League is a little bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, it is a fairly entertaining blockbuster, and it's good fun to see a whole bunch of likable heroes fighting together. However, with a basic and clunky story that's worsened by ugly visuals and poor directing throughout, it's still not the movie that these classic heroes deserve, and it makes for a regularly frustrating watch when it just can't get out of its ineffective moody vibes."

Still ""Justice League"" is decent and much improved over their other endeavors except for again this summer's ""Wonder Woman"". DC has gotten much better with casting, perhaps with the exception of Batman, I have my own problems with Ben Affleck as Batman-that is just me though! I am a huge fan of Ezra Miller and his great acting in his other movies, for me he was the glue that helped hold it all together along with Gal Gadot. Miller's brilliance, humor, and wit along with a decent script gave ""Justice League"" that spark that it needed!! The movie starts out slow as it introduces us to the new characters and sets up the plot- kind of plods along, but then gets on a slick steep slope and speeds along with a ""Flash"" the rest of the way!! Go in with medium expectations, and you too will enjoy the ride. I am even up for buying the DVD when it is released and ready for another thrill ride myself."

The JL overcome Steppenwolf like the X-Men practicing in the Danger Room. The difference is Superman comes in to unnecessarily ""save the day"" after grouchily waking up from a bad dream. Wonder Woman oddly forgets she is a leader. Batman is hoping for Superman's autograph. Cyborg is trying to connect to the deep web. Aquaman wants to headline LalaPolooza. Flash is hoping to get a job on the CW. Comedy requires good timing. The jokes aren't bad- they just miss the rhythm of the moment."

Each frame from the movie is a spectacle and looks as if brought straight from the original canon. The music and score are on point. Hardcore fans and anyone who comes from the pages is going to love it. There is, however, a chance that people who are new to DC characters miss things out and as a result, might feel disconnected. It could have been longer, a bit more detailed. It seems obvious that a movie in which three major characters are debuting needs to build up things a bit more gradually, have the required amount of storytelling and detail. But anyway, it doesn't make this movie anything less than a masterpiece. Some might even enjoy the pace of the movie.<br/><br/>A movie every DC fan deserved.

"jeannefrancoise","7","12","26","15 November 2017"," A complete history of being a league
","Dear readers, now I want to review Justice League as yesterday 15th November 2017, the movie is premier in my country (Indonesia). Since its announcement in 2016, we have been waiting for watching this movie and here it is!! Justice League is an amazing league. We watch an entertaining superhero movie, a sexy Aquaman, beautiful Wonder Woman, super rich Batman, houmurous Flash, serious Cyborg, and of course the handsome Superman is back! The plot is simple; that is about how to make the former League unity again with the combination of the special persons of Gotham, Atlantis, Amazon, Earth, and Krypton to defeat the enemy from dark side. The scenes of battles are ordinary because you can know the ending easily and there are many effects of CGI. The tense is also so low, so that you can turn back from doing other jobs and while you are coming back, you can still follow the scenario (The best tense in Batman Trilogy that make you can not blink your eye for just one second). Also the one is making this Justice League movie so fresh is the laughable actions or words from the Flash. Moreover, we appreciate the Director that make this movie is so compact and familiar for those who never read the real Justice League in comics. For me, the movie is the summary how each of the League coming from, what makes them special, how they know each other, and why they have the same purpose. More insightful of this; is that each League member had ever failed for a mission, and had lost their loved one, either family, spouse, or losing their own identity, so that to defeat the enemy does not mean the winner of the League, but the winner of the truth itself. One scene so questionable is that why this Justice League movie have Russian civilians involved. Maybe this is hypercritical but I critic the appearance of nuclear technology as part of environmental disaster in this movie and I do not know maybe this movie sponsors are also coming from companies who do worse wasting management. Well, let it go, grab your popcorn and do not forget to watch the movie until post-credit, because it is shown the next figure of DC Comics and hopefully the next movie is League versus League! :)"

This was more like a series of disconnected action scenes with no logical and seamless transitions. Poorly developed story line and ultra weak character development. In other words, another repeat of Batman vs Superman. Sadly, I nodded off twice during the movie. DC makes amazing and sometimes controversial animated movies and I wish they would bring this to the big screen. Find a director that's also a fan.. or someone that knows about directing and comics (Sam Raimi or Patty Jenkins).Take a hint from Marvel.. they know how to develop a story and characters.

Have not see any regular person come out of the screening complaining, everyone with a gigantic smile and delighted with the interaction of the heroes and the great post credit scenes. If I will critique something is not the actors, the directors, the thousands of people making the actual movie, the mustache BUT the movie executives that has no clue how to stop sticking their nose where is not called for. They need to let the directors and creators to make the movie they want not subject to a 2 hour time constrain. Justice League is a Fun movie, it has some really great scenes between the heroes an hoped to open doors to upcoming films.

DC finally, finally got it right with their cast and characters. They feel like actual humans (even though one is an alien). So much heart and fun in this one. They made you care about not only the populace but about the actual heroes and those they love. Each hero is brought to life, each one flawed in their own way, and each one makes you believe in hope. They are the light, the truth, and Justice will be served. A near-perfect super hero movie.

","I have never watched the other Superman movies and I only watched it to fulfill a family members request. I aren't so in super hero movies, but this was actually not so bad, but not the best either. I think it had good with super effects. The action were actually good, but I would like more development between the characters. The plot could have been made better. I think they focused more on the action part than the plot part. I think it would have been better if we could see more interaction between the different superheros due to the fact that most of them had never meet each other before. I also think the superman entrance were not that good. Would have been a lot more epic if he had came to save Batman or someone else in the last moment. In addition, the enemy had a bigger boost when he collected the three stones together. And it weren't that good plot development when they had access to his power source so easy. I really didn't expect a lot from this movie, so actually I am not that surprised. But overall it was good movie to watch in the cinema and it was entertaining.

I simply can't recall one moment where I felt that the tone was off; or that the plot wasn't cohesive. Comic-book fans will appreciate the references and nods to it's source and general audiences will be pleased with the character dynamics this movie had to offer (and awesome action sequences).

Fortunately that was not the case. Although I think 10-15 more minutes would have helped to round some things and improve the pacing, the movie is a blast from start to finish. Great action, nice special effects, the right amount of humour and, specially, a very good construction of characters. I loved their interactions, personalities and work team. Loved Superman and the way he assumes his destiny. Overall it was a pleasant two hours ride, in some moments I was as happy as a kid watching on the edge of my seat these beloved and larger than life superheroes fighting side by side.

"alvmanalm","3","7","14","30 November 2017"," Tell me viewer: do you bleed? You will.
","A disappointing movie (or maybe a terrible cut of a movie). Man of Steel was a pretty decent movie, specially if we take into account what they were trying to do with the Superman character. It had coherence, sobriety and even some degree of philosophical and socio-political thought, not to mention good acting (even with all the action and special effects on screen). And let's not forget that the young Clark Kent character was a reader of Plato and that we could enjoy Hans Zimmer epic music throughout the movie (just to mention two very interesting aspects). Batman v. Superman wasn't as good as expected, considering the very awaited clash between the Bat-Man and the Super-Man, but I admit it would be difficult to convey the idea that Batman could last more than one or two rounds against Superman (even with the kryptonite weapons). Nevertheless, it was a movie that made some sense, despite the extremely weak plot surrounding Lex Luthor's plans to set off a battle between the two main characters: I mean, he is portrayed as a very intelligent man, but Bruce Wayne, as a detective, would have been able to figure out who sent him those newspaper cuts and that it was all an evil plan. Ben Affleck was a total surprise. Probably some of his best acting. His Batman was dark, sober, cunning, violent (reminding me a lot of the initial versions of Batman) and mature – a common man who had to rise to the occasion in order to protect the world from a very serious threat (an alien one), potentially apocalyptic. I mean, I think it's remarkable that a mere mortal (as heroic as he may be) faces an enhanced kryptonian and says: ""Tell me. Do you bleed?"" And Superman's death, though not epic, was emotional. Justice League, on the other hand, made very little sense or no sense at all. There's a great number of aspects that I could mention, but I'll just focus on the characters and their development, to keep it short and to the point: Batman: no longer the earth's defender who suffered from cold sweat thinking about the possibility that his worst nightmares would become true. Ben Affleck changed his own interpretation of Batman completely (or the writers did). It didn't work. Wonder Woman: same as before, although kind of disappointing considering her time on screen. Aquaman: I don't know what happened. They were able to turn an usually uninteresting character, though serious, haughty and noble, into a teenage joker in the body of a 38 year old man, who is also kind of a surfer. It's a character that we don't get to know at all and that has no depth. In fact, he's kind of an idiot. Flash: the comic relief. But it didn't have to be. They chose to depict him as a young man; that's fine, but that doesn't mean he has to be a wide open eyes goofball all the time. We understand there's something going on in his life, with the mother and father background, but we don't actually get to know him. Cyborg: a surprise. Also a stranger to us, but still a surprise. His mopey, melancholic and dark character was well balanced and made sense: he died and came back as something he still doesn't quite understand yet; his comprehension of the world and of himself is constantly changing due to the power of the box, and it shows. Steppenwolf: a dummy. Nothing more. He was just bits and pieces of light on screen. They could have replaced him with any other ""puppet"" that it would not have made a difference. We don't actually know his motivations (it's all very superficial), where he comes from, what he wants, his level of power (looks very menacing at first, but then it fades away). Superman: probably the biggest disappointment after Batman. His comeback was supposed to be extremely emotional and thrilling. Instead, it was predictable, announced and too fast. There wasn't a build up. They were actually able to destroy the ""savior trope"" with him. He saved the day, true, but in a very blend and lukewarm way. Finally, let me just mention the fact that the movie was sometimes kind of corny. Just remember the scene where they are all standing together on top of that building and those little flowers are growing... This is the Justice League, not a group of boy scouts. I really hope they take things slow the next time around and are able to actually build it up instead of building it down like they did. This may be evidence that having that many good and famous directors, producers and writers is a recipe for disaster."
"Ulrik-KW","3","7","14","29 November 2017"," Why can't DC make decent movies
","First of all a disclaimer, I only sat in for the first hour of the movie. After that I simply couldn't be bothered to watch any more. My rating is based on the first part - it might have picked up tremendously during the second part, but I don't imagine what could have happened during that part to justify a 7.3 on IMDb.<br/><br/>On a side note, I have watched a ton of JL the animated shows, so I feel I know the characters pretty well.<br/><br/>I felt that everything was centered around special effects. The story, I felt, had no real cohesion and it seemed to jump around all over the place. They try to put in a bit of backstory for some of the characters but it's so shallow it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>Affleck does a good job as Batman, as does Gadot for WW. However there is absolutely zero chemistry between Wayne/Batman and Alfred. The flash is too much of a comic relief. As he himself says he has no combat training or anything, and is afraid of everything basically. Where in the world did he get that suit from?? Cyborg is by far the worst character, Momoa as Aquaman is not a whole lot better."
"niko2895","10","7","14","23 November 2017"," Lots of info, not a lot of action
","This movie is excellent if you are a superhero fan. All the characters are represented pretty well, all their powers are shown as well as their mannerisms, except one of our heroes, Aquaman. Aquaman was someone who you came to love with having this tough guy look with cool guy phrases that really made him seem awesome. But unfortunately, during all of his fight scenes (except one in Atlantis) he never uses the first part of his name, WATER. This did not turn me away from liking him as a character but by not having him use water during his fighting is like having Spider-Man not use webs to fight. As for the whole movie overall, it is about a 2 hour movie, about an hour is spent on backstories for Aquaman, Flash, and Cyborg, about 30 min is spent on superman, and the last 30 min is fighting Steppenwolf. At least this is what it feels like when watching it. This is not a BIG issue but it could have been solved if DC did what avengers did and make the movies for each hero first, and then have Justice League. It would have been a lot more fun to watch with more action and superhero stuff. In my final review, I actually give this movie an 8 but because I like to promote movies, I give it a 10"

"skyhawk721","2","7","14","21 November 2017"," Not Worth Watching Snyder's Ruin the DCEU!
","So, I usually consider myself the most forgiving viewer when it comes to movies. I generally love a good plot, with good pace, good actors, great CGI, and good writers and director. This movie failed in every aspect except great CGI. The following are the reasons why.<br/><br/>1: Good Plot - While the concept of Steppenwolf coming to destroy the world could have been great, the introduction, and story line was a complete flop for me. It was tactlessly executed, and horribly rushed like the events of BvS.<br/><br/>2: Good Pace - There was only one pace and it didn't even slow down long enough for you to relate to the rushed origins of the new characters. The pace was so quick it felt like the director didn't even have a passion for it.<br/><br/>3: Good Actors - While Henry Cavill does still look the part of Supes, he did not deliver like he did in the past with the personality. Then you have actors like Ben Affleck who failed me in this film after I gave him the benefit of the doubt with BvS. Then you add Ezra Miller who should have never been cast as the Flash ever!!!!! (It doesn't help that I was angry when I heard the casting of Flash before production was Miller). Miller is a terrible Flash and the pointless attempts at humor didn't help. He was just as bad as the Flash as he was the hidden antagonist in Fantastic Beasts. Miller probably ruined this movie more for me than Snyder directing it (and Snyder is horrible with the DCEU). Also, although Jason Momoa is a great actor, he completely failed to embody Arthur Curry. Gal Gadot was as good as usual (even though Snyder held her back a lot in my opinion). The only character I think they got right at all was Cyborg, Ray Fisher was the perfect choice, and the portrayal was right up the ally for Victor Stone's accident aftermath personality (not enough to earn this category a point though).<br/><br/>4: Great CGI - The one area where the movie did not fail was with CGI. The action sequences were on point, and the powers looked great (well everyone's but the Flash's in my opinion, (way to much lightning)). But, great CGI is pointless without a good plot, and so this felt like the mindless destruction that occurred in Metropolis in Man of Steel.<br/><br/>5: Good Writers and Director - All the issues in the world of cinema stem from the creators. The writers belly flopped so hard, it felt like none of them could agree on the events or the tone. It also did not help the film bringing Joss Whedon in late in production to finish directing and rewriting a couple of cuts for Snyder's absence (Snyder's vision still failed me with his 80% execution as the director). And then... there is the greatest sin to the DCEU ever, Zack Snyder as the director. Snyder ruined the feel of these films; he set the wrong tone of the world, and he couldn't make a single character truly hit home with their comic book counterparts in any of his three films. I even gave Snyder a chance twice before this film because he was in control of my idols! Three strikes and he is out, I won't buy a ticket to another Snyder comic film ever again.<br/><br/>So, my overall rating for this film, based on the five categories I mentioned is a "".5"" out of ""5"". Yes, even though I gave false credit in the past in hopes for a brighter future for the DCEU, I am no longer giving Snyder a chance. Snyder has ruined my favorite franchise of all time, and he can take a hike right next to M. Night Shyamalan for ruining Avatar Last Air Bender, and James Wong for ruining Dragonball. I wanted the DCEU to be better than Marvel, but my hats off to Disney, they know how to make comic books into films!"

All I can say to that is, I WAS A F'ING IDIOT, IT IS QUITE SIMPLY MAGNIFICENT!!!!!!<br/><br/>First the positives: Ezra Miller steals the film as the humorous, exciting Flash. Jason Momoa is Cool as Hell as Aquaman. Ben Affleck is outstanding as our favourite Bat while Gal Gadot is simply 'Wonderful'(pun intended) as Wonder Woman. Ray Fisher does a fine job up is upstaged by the above. The rest of the cast is fantastic do their part. The action sequences are great, not over the top and pit the characters as we have seen in the other DCU films in movements that look like they have been taken straight out of the panels of some of the greatest DC publications of all time.

"cousbrojs","7","11","25","15 November 2017"," Messy, fun, entertaining!
","I'm a fan of Marvel but a bigger fan of the DC brand, so every time I head into a DC movie there is some DC bias. But so far, the DCEU has yet to fully win me over. Man Of Steel was decent, BvS was average and Suicide Squad was laughable. Luckily, Wonder Woman was lot's of fun and enjoyable, so my expectations were high for Justice League. So, how is it? Well....<br/><br/>First of all, I didn't like the plot that much. It was messy, disjointed and at times incoherent. I don't know if the shortened run-time hurt the plot since a lot of the sub plots went missing or half way through were just cut off (if there's an extended version, I might be keen to get it). Steppenwolf just felt misused. He was a simple generic villain, that could've worked, but so many missed opportunities with him that it was disappointingly handled. The CGI also needed a bit of work. These things definitely hurt the movie, and had more time gone into reworking these negatives instead of re- shoots, it could've been better. But...<br/><br/>I loved the Justice League! Ben Affleck's Batman was once again a great showcase. Gal's Wonder Woman felt fully developed after her stint in BvS and solo outing. Momoa's Aquaman was fun and larger than life. Ezra's Flash was witty, entertaining and exciting to watch and newcomer Ray Fisher's portrayal of Cyborg was nuanced, but believable. The way they bicker, argue, interact and work together felt magical. It was very reminiscent of the first Avengers movie when they team up at the end. It was a blast! Their chemistry is what elevated the movie, and they were far better than they had to be. If anything, THEY are why you go see the movie, if for anything else. The second and third act of the movie is also very good. If you complained that MoS, BvS, SS and WW had terrible 3rd acts, I'm pleased to say that JL fixes that, immensely. It was fun, lighthearted, interesting and a bright direction on where the next slate of DCEU movies head. <br/><br/>All in all, while the villain was generic, plot was messy and CGI was pretty bad in certain scenes, the Justice League's chemistry and a strong closing act help elevate JL to be a at times messy, wholly fun and very entertaining viewing. I plan on seeing it again and hope there's an extended version.<br/><br/>7.4/10"

","Oh boy where to start.<br/><br/>This movie had such a good premise of what it could have been...but unfortunately isn't.<br/><br/>You can clearly see contrast of 2 people doing the movie( Snyder/ Whendon). the movie sometimes feels like they have put scenes together from 2 different versions of the same movie. It is also kind of boring and slow.. It just misses the mark almost everywhere. You watch the whole movie just expecting...more. It feels it was made in rush to hit the date. The scenes are like 2-3/5. there is so much room to make it better. And it is short too. You can't make potentially great super hero movie with 6 different superheroes under 2 hours. It is just not enough time to give every character deserved justice<br/><br/>Characters are underdeveloped with barely any back stories, Aquamen and Flash barely even have any screen time(definitely not enough). Cyborg not far behind... The back stories are backbone of such a movies to me. Everybody loves character development especially with superpowers. Without this it's hard to really comment on individual characters as I don't feel I even know or care for them.<br/><br/>Villain is one of the most boring, weak and nonthreatening character I ever seen in superhero movie right there with WW's villain. <br/><br/>Plot is very predictable, boring and already seen several times. For such a big movie they could have put more effort into thinking this trough. This movie could have been called 'Superman's revival'. That's all batman wants to do for fist half, other then put together the team for final fight which Superman could just win by himself. The villain is just not good enough for all of them to fight him...<br/><br/>I normally like Henry Cavill's acting but in here it felt as it was just a side gig he has to do along the movies he wants to do (Moustache CGI is ridiculous and his contractual commitment from other movie to prevent him to shave, shows lack of commitment to me as it is his performance)<br/><br/>WW scenes were exactly as expected after her own movie - lots of cleavage and ass shots and her classic wooden position: shoulders back as much as possible and 1 leg step forward slightly bend<br/><br/>I would describe my feelings after the movie as 'Lack of...'I just felt the movie is constantly missing something and just doesn't come together at the end.<br/><br/>This is just another nail to DCU coffin which makes me stop looking forward to other DCU movies as they keep disappointing...<br/><br/>I guess we just have to wait for Infinity War if we want to see decent superhero flick. <br/><br/>Well done WB, way to kill your own franchise... <br/><br/>After this, comparing Marvel movies with DC ones is like comparing steak with frozen pizza...( I enjoy frozen pizza occasionally if I'm too lazy too cook or just too broke till next pay check comes in:)"

","First of all, I should first make note that I only went to see this because I had a free pass valid for IMAX showings. I knew that the reviews for this movie weren't up to par, but I still thought that it might have its moments, especially since I enjoyed ""Wonder Woman."" Having seen it, I can say that ""Justice League"" has a few entertaining parts but is overall another disappointment for DC comic book movies. (Still, it's not an unfettered disaster like ""Batman v. Superman"" or ""Suicide Squad."")<br/><br/>The biggest problem with ""Justice League"" is just how bland and dull it is. The film feels about as formulaic as a superhero team-up movie could get, with little plot or character development. The visual style feels completely 'been there, done that,' as does the excessive amount of CGI and relatively clunky action scenes commonly found in DC films. The villain, Steppenwolf, also feels very meh. The CGI effects of Steppenwolf and his minions are almost laughable. And the movie's script, with by-the-book writing that's cringe-worthy half the time, is generally poor, although I will give the writers credit at trying to pull off an interesting and unique enough sort-of-plot-twist in the second half.<br/><br/>That's not to say that ""Justice League"" doesn't have any redeemable qualities. Some of the performances are fine, although even the lead actors are unfortunately given relatively little to do to stand out from the other main characters. The film does have some enjoyable action scenes and one-liners, particularly a team-up scene with all the main heroes that occurs a little before the halfway mark. But these moments still fail to infuse the film with a spirit of originality, making this a serviceable but highly forgettable film. 5/10<br/><br/>Note: Having had a free IMAX pass, I saw this movie in IMAX. The picture and sound quality were good, but they did not stand out in a manner characteristic of some other films I have seen on IMAX screens."

The League is heroic and inspiring, and you find yourself admiring the little things they do and rooting for them...even if the villain is rather weak. <br/><br/>From a heroic and remorseful Bat, a compassionate and passionate Wonder Woman, a loyal and eager Flash, a conflicted yet dedicated Cyborg and badass Aquaman; the League shines for its ability to lean on each other and simply tell the audience: YOUR Justice League is here.<br/><br/>And trust me, that's enough. Superman steals the scenes he appears in, which also emphasise the fact that this movie is extremely entertaining. Watch it and enjoy it, the League has arrived; and they aren't going anywhere.<br/><br/>#AllIn"

","Just Freaking Amazing. Being a DC fanboy, i was waiting since a long time for a Awesome DC movie(Not that others were bad:P). Finally the Marvel Fanboys wont accuse DC of being the lesser Comics when it comes to Cinematic Universe. Loved each and every character in the Movie especially The Flash and Aquaman. Liked the Idea of DC taking a little humorous approach towards its movies as compared to BVS(which was still Great), and at the same time serious and with a strong storyline. Just Love It."

","I already knew this was going to be bad. Heck, the guy who plays Superman recently called DC films a joke during an interview. But I scored free tickets to an early screening and game on. Speaking of the screening, it wasn't even full which is strange for a blockbuster liked this. Anyway, the film is worse than Batman V Superman. The storyline is convoluted and rushed, the guy who plays the Flash is just as annoying as Lex Luther, and there are a ton of fast-mo action shots - I'm guessing to cover up the bad CGI. This film is a mess. I dozed off during an action scene a little over an hour into it and woke up right before the stupid and predictable boss battle with the stupid ""twist"" we knew about before this movie was even made. The film is a joke. I'm giving it an extra star just to be nice considering I didn't watch about 20 minutes of it."
"jamesl2061-683-328126","4","8","17","20 November 2017"," More Heroes but still a Zero Sum movie
","So the highly anticipated DCU ensemble movie is finally here.<br/><br/>I've always been a fan, got the comics and have known the characters since childhood and I wanted to like this movie. Unlike the Avengers sequels which I expected to be mere shadows of the first installment but weren't, I truly expected to enjoy this newest adventure but didn't.<br/><br/>More accurately, I couldn't. Perhaps it is still a bit much to relate to yet another Batman and Superman. Or perhaps it was the stilted acting or the corny lines. Maybe it was because the scriptwriters were so busy trying to weave multiple characters together that they forgot to give the villain, Steppenwulf, a personality. The obvious CGI gave us a paper-mache anti-hero who was not interesting enough to take seriously, let alone dislike. In comparison, the android Ultron was more convincing.<br/><br/>I also had difficulty caring if Superman lived or died and I doubt Lois or Ma Kent felt any different in their reunion scenes. He may have the body and the looks but let's face it, Henry will never score high on charisma or presence. Then there is the Flash who like Marvel's Spiderman was reduced to being an juvenile crackhead whose every scene only enhanced his awkward cringe-worthiness. As for Affleck's stint as the bat, I am amazed he can walk, let alone fight in his sumo suit. Come on DC, less is more? He's supposed to be a genius, one who doesn't need to be padded like an Abrams tank.<br/><br/>Put these caricatures together with Gadot, Momoa and Fisher and you have 2 hours of big budget, underwhelming action. Hence, zero sum, the exciting is canceled out by the mediocre.<br/><br/>Am I being harsh? Well just ask yourself if you would pay to see a standalone Batman, Superman or Flash movie? We already know how badly the Man of Steel tanked on his solo outing so no need to go there again. Batman and Superman together didn't fare better.<br/><br/>Go see this and judge for yourselves. The JLA legacy deserves that much but I'd sooner watch another Diana Prince movie than a Justice League sequel. With this ensemble and production team, less would definitely have been more."

"rgkarim","8","9","20","16 November 2017"," Super Cast, Brings Justice To This Franchise
","LIKES:<br/><br/>Casting: A movie relies heavily on a cast, especially finding those worthy of holding the mantle of our iconic heroes. Justice League's director gets an A+ from me for the cavalcade of talent crammed into the new super team. While Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill are still not the best fillers for their roles compared to others, they did well in their involvement in the film to warrant applause. Gal Gadot reprises her role fantastically, bringing everything we loved in her stand- alone film and delivering it in spades to this installment in looks, demeanor, and kick butt fighting. However the highlights are Ray Fisher, Jason Momoa, and Ezra Miller. Fisher has the chip on his shoulder, passively destructive role down pat, showing the struggles of new power. Momoa has that brashness/arrogance of a rogue who feels he is above the rules, who soon begins to understand the limits of the lone wolf. However, Miller was spot on for the role of The Flash, capturing all the charisma, comedy, and nerdism I've enjoyed with the modern telling of the fast hero. The cast works so well together, bringing the roles to life in a very entertaining manner that feels like the League of the past on Cartoon Network.<br/><br/>The Comedy: The hero movies are starting to shift from adventure to comedy genre for me, and Justice League took a major turn down this avenue. Much of the writing is well-timed, comedic goal, utilizing well-timed cursing, witty sarcasm, and a sharp edge banter that many love, especially when the characters fence with their insults. Of course, the Flash, has a major hand in the laughs, his geeky, naïve admiration of the heroes laying the groundwork for other comedic devices that involve both physical and mental qualities, seriously his face is hilarious. With this comedy laid out throughout the movie, one will find it hard not to chuckle quite a few times in the movie. <br/><br/>The Action: If you've read my reviews on previous DC movies, you know that the action is often weak for me when comparing to Marvel's masterpieces. Happily, the comic book battles that hooked us from the comics have finally started arriving. Justice League, much like Thor, have a number of exciting moments that act as stepping stones to the excitement at hand. Much of these brief stints are more entertaining than some of Marvel's skirmishes, able to grab the serious tone of DC and deliver a darker fight to ensnare us. The semi-diverse fights bring out the technology bangs, and really deliver an action-packed punch that much of this universe has lacked. Finally, this studio is getting things right. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>Shallow Story/Characters: There is a reason Marvel divided their universe into multiple, single character focused stories, in that it builds up the characters for one to latch onto. With their failing enterprise, DC skipped a lot of steps to go directly to the group movie and as a result the character development is lacking. Enough ground work has been laid to get the gist, but Justice Leagues has too many story elements in it to give that satisfying feeling of accomplished storytelling. With little mystery, buildup, and sometimes even challenge, this film's adventure is a little rushed for this reviewer, culminating into a rather bleak, predictable mess. <br/><br/>Snyder-Vision: The slow moving special effects were great so long ago, and still have an emotional bite to them that really maximizes the kill. Yet Snyder can't seem to listen to the audience members/critics, or is rebelling because he won't stop overusing it. Justice League continues the trend of utilizing the tactic for nearly every exciting scene, sometimes in good taste, and often in more egotistical, eye-rolling displays of drawn out cinema. Hope you like seeing every detail at half speed, because you are going to have your fill. <br/><br/>The final battle: After all the preparation, all the little battles to tease you, one hopes for that defining climax that really puts the battle over the top. Justice League dropped the ball on this for me, not in terms of being lame (like Suicide Squad), but instead not being much different from the trailers. This final battle has had much spoiled in the advertising, and rather than building upon it, like the Avengers, the movie held little flare outside of the battle with the Steppenwolf. That gigantic army you saw in the trailers doesn't really do much, which was so disappointing with all the hype they placed. It was a good start DC, now finish with that bang we all want to see. <br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>If you read other reviews, you'll see this movie was panned, but this critic found much to enjoy in this movie. It's fun, funny, and a rather good introduction to future team movies with an incredible cast to boot. Sure, it still has some rough story patches, and they haven't quite understood the execution of a good finale (or the balanced use of slow-motion). Still, it's the best movie of the DC universe for me overall, and a good comic book movie to boot. Naturally, I'll recommend this for the theater, and implore you to enjoy the comedic ride and chaotic action at hand in what will hope be a starting point to the next wave of DC movies. <br/><br/>My Scores:<br/><br/>Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 8.0-8.5 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0"
"Dash1969","Null","9","20","16 November 2017"," Just Awful
","You can believe all the negative things being said about this movie. What's remarkable is that it's such a bad experience that it turns out to be the ultimate pallet cleanser. What I mean, all other movies you see after having to endure this awful film will seem less bad by comparison. I realized this while walking out of the ""Justice League"" showing. It's a terrible movie in its own right but I found myself saying, ""At least it wasn't as awful as BvS."" That's not a joke or an over-exaggeration in any way. Walking out of BvS was like getting punched in the gut. With this mess, all you'll feel is let down. Maybe a bit cheated, disappointed and even a bit lost but not really angry.<br/><br/>Judging by the ratings here and a few critics that I read, I was expecting at least a decent film.

","Even though I fell asleep watching Man of Steel and Bvs.S, I really enjoyed Wonder Woman so I was willing to give DC movies another chance. I watched the movie in IMAX in a packed theater, and not one person laughed during the entire movie. The 2hrs felt too long for me due to the lack of any plausible plot or chemistry between the characters. I just counted down until the movie was finally over. The villain was another CGI character with no emotion nor is the audience allowed to sympathize or even understand his motivations. The villain was no match for Superman, and there was not one moment of crisis for the characters. It was too easy. The Flash was clearly supposed to be the comic relief of the film, however, his lines were not delivered properly to give the audience a laugh. It was as if he was trying purposely to be funny, which obviously the audience caught on because no one laughed. Aquaman never uses his aquatic powers during the final battle.. He was just Tridentman. Batman and Wonder Woman were the only watchable parts of the movie, but not enough to save it. I came out of the theater wishing that I had watched Thor: Ragnorak again."
"sHabbadooo","3","6","12","20 November 2017"," DC just can't get it right.
","The biggest problem with this film, is the audience don't care about the world DC has built. You cannot stake the world, when it isn't worth anything. They have rushed the Marvel format and are constantly playing catch-up. This movie is like the rest of the DCEU, it isn't good. Don't let the hype around Wonder Woman fool you, that wasn't good either. They follow the same tired format, generic bad guy wants to destroy the world, the only problem is Justice League has Superman. He's a dud. He's a deal breaker. He's far too powerful, he's as quick as the flash, stronger than Batman, Wonder Woman and Aquaman, he can do everything the rest can do, so what's the point of the others? The answer is, to struggle until he makes his triumphant, predictable and spoiled return. <br/><br/>Pros. -They lowered the run time (if only they'd made it 2 hours shorter) -The terrible opening weekend will probably (hopefully) kill this attempt at a DCEU -Lex Luthor isn't in the film (too much)<br/><br/>Cons -It was made -It tries to be funny, it tries to be a Marvel film.

Justice League is easily one of the worst films of 2017, I mean the film was just really dumb.<br/><br/>The CGI were a total JOKE, I mean really what was that ! There were shots that are just ridiculously taken ! With all the technology that is there today it impossible for films to be that awfully shot and with the huge budget of the film ! It's really was embarrassing. And I think that they made a stupid decision by making the film at this time, try to introduce the new characters first before making that stupid film but no they needed to ""catch up"" with marvel. Ben Affleck as Batman ! I love Ben Affleck and he's really one of my favorite actors and one of the best actors working today I think but he was bad I mean very very bad as Batman, in Batman V superman he was OK I guess but this time!<br/><br/>I really could go through all the characters of the film and criticize them but I'm not going to do that I'm just gonna focus on ""Steppenwolf"" the villain, the flash and superman. Steppenwolf is one of worst characters of the film well at first you see potential and you could see him as this strong villain but no he's NOT, he's just a stupid very weak villain. The flash a good add to the film but I think he reminds me of somebody and don't know who... oh wait SPIDERMAN ! The flash was really a copy pasted version of spider man he's that guy that's really fast and nobody knows about when Batman *cough* *cough* Iron man finds him and decided to bring him with the rest of the awful group. Superman which happens to be my favorite character in all Dc films, we all knew that he was going to be back from the dead, we were happy to see what's going to happen when he's back alive but now I wish that I didn't, superman made the worst comebacks I've ever seen he's just was stupid and he was mad that they brought him back alive... What ! We all know that superman is the strongest one in this stupid group but WHAT WAS THAT ! Nothing can stop him he didn't get hit not even once he made Steppenwolf like a baby. Maybe Wonder Woman were the only good thing in this film. Justice League was stupid, ugly and a awful looking film, I don't recommend this film to any soul ever ! even though I know that everyone will watch or already watched the film but I had to say it. Now I have to recover from the shock wave I've got from this film and watch Wonder Woman, Man Of Steel or even Batman V Superman just to clear my head of it."

It should be named Superman's Justice League. No offence to Ben fans (I'm one of them) but once again Ben is a disgrace as Batman. Desperation to compete MCU leads DCU to an epic failure as they have just narrate short stories of Aquaman, Cyborg & Flash rather than establishing there characters. 3D & Effect were good, but DCU must stop portraying lead characters solely on 3d Models, because they doesn't pitch well enough. No establishment of Steppenwolf's character properly, which drags no excitement or fear. The scene where superman went to his own broken statue were resemble to the x men apocalypse last scene. One can easily learn how to sink multistar-cast/characters. DCU desperately need a good story writer as well as Christian Bale as a Batman. On positive side, only Gal Gadot's cuteness will can drive you crazy. Good narration of Aqua, Flash & Cyborg's stories.

Most surprisingly about ""Justice League"" is how cheap it looks, the film cost THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS! Why does this superhero team up movie look as pricey as a CBS crime drama?! Many people thought the success of ""Wonder Woman"" meant that WB and DC had figured it out, but no, here comes Zack Snyder doing what he knows best, turning light, fun comic book material into his dark, twisted little fantasy, Joss Whedon's involvement sheds some light, and I do mean some, but it's all in vain, really the only two highlights here are Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman and how the film decided to use Cavill's Superman, there are nice team moments but they are most certainly few and far between. ""Justice League"" is a small baby step in the right direction for these characters but not much else. Everyone involved deserves better, from the cast to the crew to the audience, it's time WB moved from Zack Snyder, it's clearly a failed relationship with nothing left to offer, zip, nada."

A very enjoyable ride, with great casting choices and perfect chemistry between the different characters. Thin, straightforward plot and bland villain but just watching the league slowly coming together was worth it. The interactions between flash, batman and wonder woman were especially endearing and heartfelt. Also, the cinematography and filming was visually stunning, especially for a comic book movie. When watching avengers in 2012, it was a nice experience watching superheroes assemble to form a team but Justice League pretty much blows it out of the water because you finally feel as though these are gods fighting and not a couple of human beings with super powers.

"TheLittleSongbird","6","4","7","21 November 2017"," Doesn't quite do 'Justice League' justice, better than anticipated though
","Having been underwhelmed by the waste of great potential that was 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' (not terrible but rather lacklustre) and seeing that critical reception was not particularly good, expectations for 'Justice League' were not very high.<br/><br/>Although it has major problems, 'Justice League' turned out to be better than expected. Contrary to the constant critic bashing, which to be perfectly honest has gotten out of control and extremely annoying fast for a while now, critics get a good deal of respect from me. Even when my opinions differ to theirs, which has happened a fair number of times, their appraisals and criticisms are very understandable and it is easy to see where they are coming from. 'Justice League' is a case of the film being much better than anticipated, considering the word of mouth and 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' being so disappointing. Is 'Justice League' better than that film? Yes, by quite a bit.<br/><br/>'Justice League' does have its problems. Although the CGI is pretty good on the whole, there is an over-reliance of it and it doesn't always add to some of the scenes. The story has its fun and excitingly compelling moments, but a lot of it does feel rushed, which does see too many abrupt tonal and storytelling shifts, and some of the first half has a cobbled together and rambling quality. Am usually not one to carp about plot holes, much of the time it is a lazy criticism to me, but one can fit the Grand Canyon through some of them and some border on the ridiculous.<br/><br/>The rushed pacing does come at the expense of character development, which tends to be rather flimsy. Particularly true to this is the villain, there is nothing menacing or remotely interesting about him, he's basically a very dull just there sort of character. Ciaran Hinds is completely wasted, while Ray Fisher is somewhat dull. Not all the jokes work, some feel out of place, while the final battle could have had more excitement and Danny Elfman's music score is uninspired and forgettable.<br/><br/>On the other hand, most of the acting is very good. Ben Affleck brings a brooding intensity to Batman and he didn't seem that bored to me. Other bright spots in the cast are Jeremy Irons' very amusing Alfred, Amy Adams' feisty if somewhat underused Lois Lane, Jason Momoa's beautifully judged Aquaman and particularly Gal Gadot's positively show-stopping Wonder Woman. Ezra Miller is amusing, if at times slightly too introverted, as Flash and Henry Cavill looks much more comfortable here than he did in 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'. Diane Lane and JK Simmons are also welcome presences.<br/><br/>Visually, 'Justice League' is beautifully shot, far more cohesively edited and its boldly dark and gritty look fits very well within the story. The script is less clunky and dreary and lightened by some nice quirky humour and some jokes are amusing, especially the absolute hoot that involves the magic lasso. The action is mostly nicely choreographed and fun to watch, some of the characters are interesting and the chemistry is great.<br/><br/>In summary, could have been much better but to me it wasn't that bad. 5.5-6/10 Bethany Cox"

"brailsford","2","7","15","24 November 2017"," This movie reeks of desperation to compete with Marvel
","DC had a chance to be successful, not based on competing with the MCU, but by trying to make good stories for there characters, taking the time to build a universe that fans would want more of. Instead they run head long in after one good movie, try to directly compete with another franchises latest movie creating a crumby product. It's hard to believe the company that gave us the DC animated universe couldn't learn a lesson from it and realize how stupid it was to go head to head with Marvel. That is why we got garbage with Batman v. Superman, and that is why this one is as bad, maybe worse.<br/><br/>Humor is inserted this time, that feels forced, incredibly, unsubtly forced. It hasn't always been perfect in marvel, but overall it hasn't felt like ringing the last drop of water out of a dish rag. Drawing faces on people. Taking a serious scene and following a line like ""Do you bleed?"" with ""Definitely feel something bleeding"" 5 seconds later. It's like they couldn't even figure out when to be funny, when to be serious in a single scene.<br/><br/>This movie felt like it was checking off items on a list of things they thought they needed to make the movie as successful as Avengers.<br/><br/>That said it gets an extra star for being so bad... it's practically an mst3kable film with plenty of things to crack jokes about.<br/><br/>Some of you are not going to agree with this review, but there are also some out there so fanatically dedicated to this universe they can't criticize it when it drops the football like it has.<br/><br/>If you are willing to go in fairly watching this movie it has some cool special effects, a horrible script but on the plus side, it's significantly more coherent then B. V. S. Also more Alfred, Alfred is probably the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this movie as a good superhero movie but rather as an experience... to see just how bad franchise can get in 5 movies."
"juhana-mustakallio","4","7","15","24 November 2017"," So shallow
","I like Batman and have read comics relating to him. It was the reason also to go see this movie. Batman vs Superman was entertaining, but they tried to fit too many plots into one movie. It also had some level of depth, at least compared to Justice League. It has absolutely nothing. The fighting scenes are boring mostly there's no real choreography it's just smashing and swinging. The scenes were consisted on cheesy one liners and boring fighting scenes. There were no tension between the characters and they didn't even get to know each other that well during the movie, even though they pretended to after having known for like a day or two. So yes it was forced, big surprise. I wonder why couldn't they do the individual movies first and do Justice League with more depth after that. This was just bullshit. And I'm not a Marvel fanboy I think their movies are quite shallow as well and way too flashy. They're entertaining like BvsS was but there's nothing more to expect. Not like Nolans Batman trilogy"

","Here is the whole conclusion at the beginning: The best part of this movie is the first two minutes which is just the opening theme song! the whole movie is a total failure, a cheap attempt to duplicate Marvel's success by a juvenile retracing the same steps. The characters aren't defined at all and you can see that the dynamics between them is terrible. Take the FLASH as an example, he is supposed to be the funny one, since from the beginning and by the definition, none of the characters in the group can show that much of a comic face, but at the same time the interactions between the characters seem off and unexplained. The villain is not defined at all and you never get the answer to his identity and his goal, he is supposed to gather all three boxes but to what end?! no one still knows?! and after he finally does it nothing happens! so that makes the whole parameters of the movie unacceptable and raw. All actors tried their best except Gal Gadot which in my personal opinion fails terribly. It was a total let down and a big drift from the original stories in the comic books too. In general awful."

"hollywoodhernandez-70868","9","7","15","16 November 2017"," Justice League (Spoiler Alert)
","After a long wait, the band is finally together on the big screen for Justice League. The eagerly awaited movie brings together more members of the DC World; united against a common foe. Batman (Ben Affleck) travels the world searching for the super heroes who will comprise his team. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) is the first to enlist. <br/><br/>The remainder of the first part of the movie continues on two fronts. First Batman has to keep an evil space villain, Stepenwolf, at bay while he puts together the team of superheroes who can defeat him. That is the only part of the movie that hits a sour note. The film has to give the back story on three new DC heroes, Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg, in a short length of time. But, once the team is assembled, the movie is non stop action with a lot of humor mixed in. SPOILER ALERT: the movie really finds it's rhythm when Superman is brought back from the dead. (Come on, Henry Cavill's name is right there on the movie poster!) <br/><br/>Stepenwolf, Ciaran Hinds, is back on earth to find and reassemble three cubes which will give him the ultimate power to rule the world and to plunge it into darkness. He's been here before. He has a history of doing battle with both the Amazons and the Aquamen.<br/><br/>The new DC characters are great. Jason Momoa from Game of Thrones is Aquaman, Ezra Miller, who had small roles as the Flash in both Suicide Squad and Batman vs Superman, reprises his role as The Flash and Ray Fisher, who's mainly known for his work on TV, plays Cyborg a half man/half cybernetic computer who is brought back from the dead by his father (Joe Morton) after he dies in an accident.<br/><br/>The movie has a lot to cover in just two hours and it ends up wrapping up all of the loose ends very nicely. Justice League is rated PG-13 for some very cartoonist violence and on my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" I rate it a JUMBO!"

"one9eighty","5","5","10","19 February 2018"," Too rushed, looks cheap, no heart :(
","I'm afraid to say that this isn't the film I was expecting and it's not as spectacular as it was billed to be. I am not a hater of this film, nor am I a lover of this film - it's an average film which acts as a vehicle to get DC films on the map a little more, but doesn't do it with the spectacular grandeur that it could have done. <br/><br/>Billed as the film to break Marvel Studio's successful grasp on Hollywood this had a lot to live up to, and I'm afraid it didn't work. The film felt rushed and cheap - which is a surprise as millions of dollars were spent on this. It felt like Warner Brothers desperately wanted to join the superhero party while it was hot and as a result HAD to put something out straight away, regardless of it was ready or not. It followed a familiar pattern set up in action films in general, FTR not just Marvel film patterns. It seemed to tick off cliché after cliché as if it was a formula for instant success. What this film missed, was a heart (and a better plot, better delivery, more thought...etc). I didn't feel engaged or part of the ride, being a comic fan for many years I can easily say there is more depth to a drawing on a piece of paper than there was in the characters here. It was a lacklustre showing and it was such a pity as there was soo much potential to be had. <br/><br/>The thing that made me angry, more so than the predictable plot and outcomes was the overuse of CGI. I understand that we are in an age where CGI is massive, done properly it can make a film brilliant, but done badly it can make a film look cheap and rushed - and unfortunately this fell into that later category. It was that obvious when CGI and green-screening had been used that it was actually off-putting to my enjoyment of the film. I have read some reviews on here which absolutely nailed it true to form; saying that the villain in this looked like he had been lifted straight from a computer game, saying that Superman looked artificial due to the CGI, saying that they believed the back grounds in Errol Flynn swashbuckling pirate films from years of yesterday were more believable. I can't agree more with some of these sentiments. 
I really didn't want to nit-pick with this film for fear of starting an avalanche but there were scenes in this where I was thinking ""oh come on, give me a break"". For example, the ""where is everybody"" factor. To many times through this film there was a big action sequence, yet not one random person was there, nobody in the background, no police or military presence, nobody. Millions of pounds of damage, and only a handful of people in shot and they all happen to have lines in the film. WTF - ""where was everybody""??<br/><br/>Before I start nit-picking anymore I'll conclude...<br/><br/>Did I hate the film? Not absolutely, it still was a brainless action film. Did I love this film, not by a long way. I'm afraid the best I can give this is 5 out of 10 - I've seen better films on the SyFy channel and I'm afraid that this is where I can see this ending up in a few years' time."

The overuse of CG seems to make it more like a graphic novel if only contained within a dozen frames for the story.
By 3/4 the way through I had literally lost the plot, I couldn't figure out who was fighting who, for what reason they were fighting, and all these back stories.<br/><br/>DC is trying too hard to be Marvel. Sure, they've put all of the ingredients in to it, but they can't cook for nothing."
"mike_clark_5729","4","5","10","22 November 2017"," I went in expecting nothing...
","...and that's exactly what I found.<br/><br/>The plot is basically copy-and-paste from the first Avengers movie. The digital effects look like they are something out of The Mummy Returns. There is essentially no character development, which would be fine if these were all firmly established characters, but they aren't. Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg are all making their first movie appearances. The Superman that we see here bears very little resemblance to the character of the same name from Man of Steel and Batman vs. Superman.<br/><br/>DC/Warner Brothers seem to have taken previous criticism of the previous movie being too dark and joyless to heart and has horribly over-corrected. There are lots of jokes to be found, most of them not good, in my opinion, though sense of humor is highly subjective.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is good but there's nothing on the page for her to work with. Henry Cavil is like he always is, which to me comes off as stiff. Affleck seems like he's increasingly desperate to remove himself from this series and can't be bothered to even really try. I've never been a fan of Ezra Miller in general, and his portrayal of Peter Parker... I mean, Barry Allen, does nothing to change that. I don't understand how it's possible for Jason Momoa to be this uninteresting, as big and magnetic as he is in other things, he comes off as completely uninteresting here.<br/><br/>I can't help but feel like Warner Brothers were worried about releasing another critical disaster like Batman v. Superman and settled for making a boring movie instead of a terrible one. Personally, I don't know if that was the better choice or not but you can easily give this one a pass.<br/><br/>And with this, I am officially done caring about the DCEU as a collective entity. The Wonder Woman sequel is almost certainly worth checking out. The Flash and Cyborg solo films? I'd say they may not even get made at this point, considering the once-again disappointing box office numbers. Hypothetical Future Justice League movies? Not without and serious, fundamental course correction."

Wonder Woman was even better.<br/><br/>The changes forced on Snyder started the ball rolling down hill. Changing what was to be a 2 part movie into 1 single film was a bad start. Then tragedy forced Snyder out before the movie was in post production. Enter Joss Whedon. Forced to make re-shoots to change the tone of the film to match Wonder Woman & still meet it's release date was an impossible task.<br/><br/>Finally, Warner Brothers decided that the movie was so bad, it had to be cut to 2 hours, to maximize the daily showings & sell as many tickets as possible, before word of how terrible this movie was got out.<br/><br/>The pacing of the film is terrible.

"ironhorse_iv","7","6","13","24 November 2017"," Justice League just wasn't in a league of its own. It really doesn't stand out, much. It's mostly generic. Meh for the most part.
","This Warner Bros Studios movie based on the DC comics of the same name, was just not up to par, in standards, comic book fans, were looking for. It's not as brave & the bold as it should had been. It was somewhat of a disappointment. First off, the film plot of a group of superheroes, stopping a run of the mill, alien invasion attacking Earth, led by a horn helmet medieval-like figure with the use of a mystic box of energy has already run its ground, with other comic books movies, such as 2012's Marvel Studios 'Avengers'. Even the Übermensch resurrection sub plot that producers thought was innovative, has also been seen before, in films like 2015's 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. In the end, I'm sorry to say this, Warner Bros & DC films, but Marvel Studios & Walt Disney Studios beat you to the punch. You're not really adding much of anything new that comic books fans, haven't seen before. Why don't you have try something new like, adapting risky, smart, complex comic book story lines like 'Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths' or ""Kingdom Come'. It's kinda similar to the comic books stories that director, Zack Snyder would probably do, well at. After all, 2009's 'Watchmen' was amazing and groundbreaking. This film story, not so much. Trust me, it's generic, safe, and thin, much like 2017's 'Wonder Woman' film, however, in that movie, it was much more, well-executed. Most of the action scenes, and characters in 'Wonder Woman' seem real. There were real emotional scenes, being played out. Don't get me wrong, even with the inconsistent of the lighthearted and dark tone in direction, due to gritty, Snyder having to step down, during production, due to the death of his daughter, and being replace by smart-aleck, meta, director, Joss Whedon. 'Justice League' is still watchable, even if the film is full of expensive odd-place dodgy reshoots, involving scenes where computer animators had erase mustaches off, superheroes faces, while, providing little too ugly looking fake-looking CGI action. It's not a total mess like 2016's 'Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice' or 2016's 'Suicide Squad'. However, its story & visuals are not that compelling. It doesn't feel real. Much of that, come from the fact that we barely got to know, the backstories of some of the heroes like Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa) & Barry Allen/Flash (Ezra Miller). In much, in the same vein, even Batman, himself, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) in the last movie with their short summary. In short, they should all, had their solo films, before this movie, even came out, much like Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Clark Kent/Superman (Henry Cavill) got, with 2017's 'Wonder Woman' & 2013's 'Man of Steel' to explore who they are. Since, they didn't do that, they come across, as cartoony & one-dimensional. It doesn't help, that one of the characters, is wearing a fake-looking CGI suit. Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher)'s appearance really disappointed me. Not only, was it, a bad choice to have him, over original members, like Martian Manhunter or Green Lantern; because it kinda eliminated a 'Teen Titan' movie & ruins the mystic of the original comic. It's also hurts the visuals. His presence really does take you, out of the movie. . Regardless of that, the best aspects of the Justice League team are the chemistry between its cast and the film's individual depiction of each superhero. Unlike the previous movies, they are decidedly heroic, instead of unlikable and impersonal. They make an effort to save each other and spare citizen lives. It's kinda of a story of redemption. Nevertheless, some of their actions, seem out of place & jarring, like Aquaman polluting the oceans with bottles like a beach-bum, and Flash being OK, with people throwing weapons at him & being a coward, at times. Still, those are nitpicks, for what was overall, alright performance. I just kinda wish the villain, Steppenwolf (Voiced and motion capture by Ciarán Hinds) was just as memorable. He really doesn't seem much of a threat at all, nor does any other enemies in this film. The action seem like a one-sided turkey shoot. Not only that, but the character was highly shallow & mostly full of one-dimensional, evil persona. It was really bland, much like the music from composer, Danny Elfman. The score from him, was very unsatisfactory. Nothing, but recycled tracks in darker tunes. It was not good. On the other hand, as least, the songs used in the film, were not that bad. I kinda dig, singer, Sigrid's cover of ""Everybody Knows"" by music artist, Leonard Cohen and Sharon Robinson. Even, the Beatles track, 'Come Together' that was used in the trailer, was fine for the most part. Although, that song, alone, was not good enough to get, audiences to go to the theaters to see it. As of this writing, the film is really underperforming, much coming from the fact that the lukewarm reaction to the film's trailer & its predecessor. I guess, they don't care much, after the two post-credits ending, like I did. Overall: While, it might seem like I hate this first big screen union of DC Comics' top-tier superheroes that went through many development hells. In truth, I just disappointed on how much, a letdown, it was. It was very adequate. Look, if you willing to look, past that, you might find, yourself, being semi entertained. In the end, I can only recommended, seeing this movie; as a rental. It's worthwhile to a certain point. It's not marvelous."

Maybe the Flash is fourth or the Green Lantern. Doesn't matter, although The Flash is pretty good on TV.<br/><br/>A house built on a weak foundation won't stand, and in Justice League the writing--the story is weak.<br/><br/>The dialogue is so on the nose, with the characters just telling you whatever is on their mind. The characters are introduced quickly, perhaps to get the story going, but there is no subtext, no build up, no real tension. The team comes together quickly. Didn't the writers watch The Avengers?<br/><br/>Perhaps the mistake that spawned all mistakes is the clear lack of knowledge about who Batman is, or the lack of appreciation for that character. Ben Affleck has the look, but just like in BvS, that is not how Bruce Wayne/Batman sounds--that is not how Bruce Wayne/Batman acts. <br/><br/>Anyone familiar with the Batman comics, or the 90s cartoon, or the Justice League cartoons, or even the Tim Burton films and the Chris Nolan ones, should know Batman's voice--the Dark Knight--the Detective. Batman is a pillar of the DC Comics universe. If you don't get him right, the Justice League house won't stand.<br/><br/>Batman wouldn't boast about his wealth, like he is, well, another guy currently in the White House who likes to tweet. He would own the fact that he doesn't have powers, and that it hasn't held him back any. AND BATMAN DOESN'T USE GUNS. <br/><br/>And Superman? How did Richard Donner and Mario Puzo get him right in 1978, but he is uninteresting in Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, and now Justice League?<br/><br/>In Justice League, for me Wonder Woman is the only well written-- well developed--multi-dimensional character. Ezra Miller's Flash is also interesting. Everyone else is a jock, nothing special.<br/><br/>DC just has no quality control, and the solution to that is simple, STOP HIRING DIRECTORS, AND START HIRING FILMMAKERS--Directors who are also experienced writers/story tellers like Patty Jenkins, Chris Nolan, and Joss Whedon. AND THEY MUST KNOW AND LOVE THE DC COMICS CHARACTERS they are putting on film.<br/><br/>Otherwise, you just end up with the Hulk movies directed by Ang Lee and that other guy. Even then, there still needs to be someone scrutinizing the script and the dailies, or you just end up with Suicide Squad. And the cartoon Suicide Squad was pretty good, so how did the live version get so off? <br/><br/>Marvel has its act together, despite misfires like Age of Ultron, and Thor Dark World. So why can't DC?<br/><br/>Lastly, why isn't Darkseid the main villain? Why one of his subordinates? And if you're going to have the subordinate, why not bring Darkseid in at the end to raise the stakes--to show the fight will continue in the next film. At least show him in a post credit scene, instead of that douche bag version of Lex--oh nevermind."

","Very few films have I had to walk out of, this numbers among them. My expectations weren't high after RT reviews and general critical buzz, but I went in fairly hopeful regardless. First let's get the CGI debate done n dusted, yep it was poor, but so what, it's our imagination, let's fire it up and ignore it (look back to what we used to deal with in the 80s n 90s) The script, pacing and overall ""direction"" was all over the place, the villain was appalling (but indie like Ciaran's voice) I suspect the poor reshoots and plot holes cause this to be laid at Josh Whedon's door.<br/><br/>As for the actors in general the only standout was Jason Momoa<br/><br/>I wished for a great film, we deserve a great film, I want something to tackle Marvel's dominance.....we got this. £22 wasted. Don't even wait for the DVD. Unless (possibly) we get Zack's original .... Even then, maybe not.<br/><br/>DC need to sort it out, build characters, make us care, don't just rely on our goodwill coming from our love of the comics."

I found that the JL film pretty exciting in the fight scenes, but also the plot and overall storyline made sense. It was darker in tone than some similar films but this added to the overall feel.

"alex_popa_81","1","3","5","9 January 2018"," What the heck was this?
","I just cannot realize what I saw. I think this movie was JLA made by DC because that's what the title say. But this... this is wierd and twisted.
First of all, and maybe the single question that really matters from my point of view is this: Does anyone from the management read some JLA comics in all their lives? I really don't think so even if they brag about this because otherwise this tryout of a JLA movie should not exist.
What the hell happened to the real costumes? What happened with the superheros stories? We just see a bunch of ""new guys"" that appear to fight together because.... damage and disaster? Arthur Curry is some guy feeding fish to starving peoples? Where is his brother? What happened to his legacy? ""Hi, I'm here, I just punched some bully in the head and now give me the scepter and the costume and I go unleash havoc on topside""? That's it? That's what it takes for a script now to become a movie-to-sell?
Oh, almost forgot. Why does Flash's costume have so much iron plating on it? Is that an armour or a costume? From my point of view it's some sort of twisted Iron Man suit rather than the cool-looking Flash outfit. Jesus! And where is his story? Hello? Flash story? You producers and screenwriters and director of this poor atempt of JLA movie, you realize that 60% of the viewers have never read a comic book in their live cause they are just TOO YOUNG? I had expectations that this movie will somehow manage to erase the Batman vs Superman pathetic performance but from my opinion, this one just purged my need to see another movie from DC.
A short description of my feelings after watching this? Ok.
1. Superheroes? Nothing interesting. Just a bunch of well-dressed guys trying to dismantle an overgrown 2 horned-asthmatic-bully.
2, Story? I'm alone but rich, I need some wierd and powerfull guys to beat some idiot who's talking to some cubes and refers to them as ""Mother"". The Lighting McFlash appears and so does the fishy guy with cool tatooes, lots of muscles and funny eyes and together with the black-suited and the hottie chick with glowing lash they find the metal guy that teaches them how to control machines and revive some dude who dies because.... other bully in the previous installment. (Wait... why does Flash needs to run so fast to produce lighting surge on the ""Mother"" to revive Clark? I thaught he knows how to vibrate to generate space-time portals and lightning strikes.... or that's just for the comic-book fans only and not to be discused in this attempt of a DC movie?). And the guy is revived but we must see why they need him so he has to beat them all at once just to remind us how important he is. And they all go to Russia and they fight this big fellow who is really afraid that they beat him and he goes away and ""I bought the bank"" line which is stupid, stupid and stupid.
Come on. Really? This is the best that you can do? That's it? Thanks. For your sake I honestly hope this is the last movie in the franchise because if you try to make another, it will not earn even half of what you invest in it.
Oh, but the CGI were great! Yeah, total waste of effects. Useless scenes with useless bullet-time effects because.... script. But they dropped. Yeah. By the half of this movie I had the impression that Deadpool is over my shoulder, whispering to my ear ""Superhero landing, it's gonna do the superhero landing"", I just started to laugh every time some dude landed dramaticaly. I stopped at 14 btw.... I just had enough."

","This movie is a complete mess in so many ways. I was kind of reminded of ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" in that we're given a series of disjointed scenes barely held together by a pretty flimsy, by-the-numbers plot. Just mash up the villain plots from ""Man of Steel"" and ""Avengers"" and you've got a pretty good idea whats in store here. <br/><br/>The characters are portrayed relatively well for what they're given. The CGI is wildly inconsistent, one of many symptoms of a troubled, rushed production. There are some really fun moments between the heroes here but they come and go too quickly to really be enjoyed. I felt like I was watching a 2hr, hastily edited, abridged version of a 3hr+ original film. Replacement director, Joss Whedon injects his familiar humor but it creates a tonal clash that constantly pulls you out of the movie. Lip service is occasionally paid to some characters' individual arcs but they never really go anywhere. <br/><br/>Danny Elfman's score is bland and forgettable. Even the occasional flourish of his 1989 Batman theme or even John Williams' Superman theme come and go so fast, you wonder why they bothered. <br/><br/>This is really an unfinished film whose studio seemed to prioritize making a release date over creating a valuable product. It has a beginning, middle and end but not much meat in between."

"nightstrife","1","8","20","25 November 2017"," A truly abysmal movie
","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>What a horrible piece of garbage this movie was. I watched it last night and almost cringed immediately with the terrible line ""the whip compels you to tell the truth""... Urgh...<br/><br/>So much is wrong with this movie, it's hard to begin. Superman is hardly in it, the villain is just pathetic, the acting is wooden and the effects are pathetic.<br/><br/>I knew going into the movie that there was going to be some funny looking CGI on Superman's upper lip. Little did I know that the CGI department was entirely made-up of kids doing their work-experience and rushing to get the project done in a hurry. <br/><br/>Actually, that sums up the whole movie - it felt rushed. There were bits missing to the story that were something that you could feel - it was tonally all-over-the-place, with Snyderisms and Wheldonisms not cohesively offsetting one another. Add to the fact that they introduced and then proceeded to play out the baddie in one movie (forgiving that Steppenwolfe was alluded to in a deleted scene in BvS), then you have a hodgepodge of a movie which undoes all the good work that Wonder Woman did earlier in the year. Yes, it really is that bad. <br/><br/>Aquaman IS a dude-bro. Cyborg is a lifeless, terrible character with an actor who can't act and Flash is all-over-the-place, a terrible take on the character who amounts to so little as to be almost inconsequential to the outcome of the film. The best moment in the entire films is when Superman nearly hits him in a fit of rage. I was praying for him to connect, as it would have turned the flash into a puff of fine red mist, which would have made this interminable film interesting for a second. <br/><br/>Indeed, a weak-point in the earlier movies, Superman doesn't get enough screen-time here, and he clearly outshines the other characters to a degree which renders them pretty much useless. Batman basically whinges about being old the whole time and nearly dies after one punch from the man-of-steel, which is actually pretty damn fair enough.<br/><br/>To say that they failed here would be an understatement. This movie is a catastrophic failure, on every conceivable level. There is no redeeming quality to it, it puts the superhero mega-team movies back by six years, it is so much less than the Avengers which came out in 2012, remember... That movie had a lot of back-story going into it, and its payoff was worth it. This movie is a rushed, waste of time and money. <br/><br/>I really don't like writing negative reviews, I loved the Punisher for its brutality and take on the character. That took some time to put together and it shows in a very binge-worthy story. This movie, however, is rushed to the point that every aspect of it feels shoehorned in. As for the flowers springing from the roots that have been spread by the Unity (stupid name by the way), they are clearly going to spread poisonous gas and kill everyone. What a dumb thing to do at the end...<br/><br/>I hated this movie. 1 star."

Awful and pathetic in every single way. New characters are boring and the old ones are completely ruined in this movie. If you enjoyed the previous movies in the series, I strongly advise against watching this one if you still value your impression of the series.

"alxmxmff","3","4","8","26 November 2017"," Another superhero cartoon, but here's the objective breakdown...
","It is a common practice nowadays to make superhero movies into something that no longer deserves even a distinction of being called a flick. They became nothing more but a boring CGI cartoons so campy that they remind of 60s Batman show. And I'm not talking exclusively about DC projects. Hell, I consider Marvel to be way worse. Back to the topic: Justice League is far from being the worst of its genre. That title should be shared by Captain America: Civil War and X-Man: Apocalypse. Those were, without any doubt, one of the greatest abominations in history of cinema. Although I'll pick up negative votes for this observation (from both shills and infantile dumbass dorks) the history will, nonetheless, prove me right. But I digress. Again. The story of JL is as predictable as it gets. Aside with now omnipresent Hollywood liberal crap shoved down everybody's throat, the low point of this ignominy-transfer are overpredictable dialogues and sad excuse for some very juvenile humor. Besides this, history teaches us that the movie with multiple heroes is always a bad idea and this one is no exception. Acting is, due to pathetic writing, basically non-existent. However, Gal Gadot and Affleck are the ones that truly excel at playing cardboards. Wonder Woman's material actually doesn't look so bad, but the sad truth is that poor Gadot just couldn't act to save her ass. Affleck ruined the excellent Batman he portrayed in BvS, but I'll go easy on the guy 'cos he really had nothing to work with this time around. Villain is absolute cliché and I wouldn't waste a one more word on this lame sucker. The highlight of the borefest was the return of Superman. We finally get to see the real Superman, not some weenie that gets his ass kicked by absolutely everyone. Actually, it seems that this is done intentionally, in an attempt to repair Superman's reputation that was ruined over the last ten or so years. Cavill did the best with what little he was presented with, hands down. The Flash is degraded into retarded excuse for comic relief while Aquaman, contrary to the trailers, is nowhere near the macho man we were fooled to believe he'll be. In fact, I'm fairly positive he gets the most of the beating throughout the movie. Cyborg is just 'meh'. As for the rest, the plot is thin and full of holes, as usual. Recommendation: fast forward to Superman parts, skip the rest of infantile cash-grab garbage."

","I am a hardcore DC fan, and getting sick of the way Marvel makes their movie with the same formula years to years. Seeing the trailer of JL, I thought there'd finally be a hope. I was terribly wrong! This movie felt like a 2 hours trailer. The only thing it has ever created was a chaotic world where Earthlings questionably divided into 3 'clans' and know nothing about each other's existence (which ridiculously leads Steppenwolf into this world !?), then throw a bunch of individual-with-super-power- but-have-no-awareness-of-keeping-their-secret-identity, running (and riding, and flying, and blah... blah... blah...) with zero idea why, from beginning til the end. Batman has been awfully downgraded into a flaw copycat of Tony Stark, but mentally weaker. Flash was fast, but tried too much to be Spider-man, even though his joke was not that funny. Cyborg was Hulk-with-iron-skin, always questioning his existence and think-out- loud that his gift is nothing but an abomination. Wonder Woman was sadly 'Captain DC', who usually gives lectures (with her own case as reference) to other members, and calls them 'babies' in the end. They are basically the trying-to-be-cool-rich-guy, the young and impulsive (quite literally), the whinny, and the pretty face who always pretend that it is not her biggest advantage. Sounds familiar now? Aquaman is a surprisingly good character, but could not save the whole movie. The plot is super simple, cliché and predictable. Attempt for spoiling this movie is unnecessary since there is no plot twist, no unexpected detail to actually make a surprise turn. We all knew Superman would return. If you wanna ruin your best friend's experience before he watch JL, I am sorry but it'll be your only card. After all, in Batman V Superman they literally killed Superman. In JL, the killed the Batman. Please, do yourselves a favor and don't go to the cinema for this. Just wait for the DVD version."

"steven-taylor64","3","4","8","19 November 2017"," DC falls short again.
","I had hopes after Wonder Woman that DC had figured out how to make decent super hero movies. Justice League proved me wrong. This was a story that has scenes that play like a montage and have no real relevance to the plot and just seem to just be there. The poor pacing ruins all the tension and drama between characters. Batman and Wonder Woman have a falling out for all of two seconds, and they almost immediately are fine with each other again with no real resolution. The backstories and motivations of main characters are glossed over and what is shown lacks so much context or real importance it left me wondering why I should even care. <br/><br/>DC is really known for it's incredible villains, so why was the second rate villain Steppenwolf the antagonist? He is so flat and one dimensional. He has no motivations for trying to destroy the world other than because evil. He references Darkseid, you know, a good villain worth a justice league movie. So they are planning to do another movie wit a good antagonist...eventually. <br/><br/>The one good thing the car wreck of BvS did, the one interesting thing, was to kill Superman, because Superman is like the kid on the playground who says they have all powers when playing super heroes. This setup for Justice League to be interesting because they had to protect the world without a character that is, essentially, all powerful. Then you watch the movie and halfway through they bring Superman back to life, ruining any possibility for tension. The action scenes in this movie were already lack luster, with the exception of the amazons at the beginning, but once Superman is introduced the fights become very boring, lacking all tension. <br/><br/>Fans of the new DC movies and BvS in particular say they are darker, and don't have the humor the Marvel movies do and that is what sets them apart. After Justice League, they can no longer say this because this movie, poorly, tries to emulate the humor and quips found in the Marvel formula. However, the dialogue for Barry Allen was actually funny and felt natural. Most of the dialogue and felt hamfisted and, at times, cringy.<br/><br/>My final thought on the movie applies to all the new DC movies, and that is the terrible CGI. Everything looks sickly. The real people are starkly contrast against the sea of animation. These movies just look bad."

I can ramble on and on. On how great this movie was and not only that Justice League is the movie you should watch with your friends and many DC Comics Fans in General. So in conclusion I've gotta say that Justice League is a big success and it's a solid 10/10 for me and the Critics or the people who rated this movie an awful one.

","This review of Justice League is spoiler free<br/><br/>** (2/5)<br/><br/>Wonder Woman was a surprise addition to the DC Extended Universe, less tonally serious and more quick witted puns were to the screenplay mostly coming from Chris Pine's stammering Captain Steve Trevor granted it had seriousness to the story when Diana Prince had to fight her way through the flanks of men during World War I but mostly it was a fun adventure enlightened by the fantastic Gal Gadot and it was seen by man as the saviour of the DCEU. Justice League sees her replenish the role as the titular heroine, and again she's on top form using her sword (not the Godkiller) and Lasso of Truth to defeat a new villain which brings a threat to end the world. The question you're probably asking is; does she standout above all the men in DC's super-squad team up? Well if Ben Affleck's Batman had his way, then, sadly not, she's stunning when it comes to battling time but it's overall it's Affleck who holds most of the clan together. <br/><br/>Thankfully, this isn't a bad thing as he's welcomed into the film with wide eyes from the audience; tonally his story is better, and, much lighter than last year's boringly brooding Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice which now we can likely forget. And maybe it's due to the lighter tone he's given after the various re-shoots from Joss Whedon after director Zack Snyder left for a family tragedy. It's not really surprising that Whedon comes with the lighthearted tone of the MCU's super-team-up Avengers Assemble, he adds several in-joke an obvious standout comes of course from Jeremy Irons' Alfred ""Those were the days where one's biggest concerns were exploding wind-up penguins"" suggesting that Batman's past is much closer to Tim Burton's Batman than it is to the straight-faced antics of Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy; a notion reinforced by composer Danny Elfman (replacing Hans Zimmer) who here has a snatch from his infamous '89 Batman theme. Obviously re-hinting at the sillier past of the caped-crusader pushing the film away from Snyder's earlier DCEU entries and giving it an entirely new tone mash up. But Whedon's involvement of the Avengers'-lite plot does come with pointing out that he includes an alien villain who teams up with some other alien beings who look oddly like another Batman villain: Firefly (is it just us that noticed this?) But to be fair, it would be tricky to maintain post-Nolan somberness when Bruce teams up with an Amazon princess, a half-human-half-cyborg, and a big hairy merman who brings a pitchfork to a laser gun fight and commands the ocean, weird? Right?<br/><br/>Sure Justice League is indeed some hokey stuff in terms of the super-team mash up they each get their time on the screen individually guiding the plot to follow their story in all this, first there's Aqauman (Jason Momoa) who only sees Bruce as guy who dresses up as a bat, his personality later transcends into sounding and looking like a rodeo clown, next we get Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) he's just a geeky guy who's never really been in battle, etc. This is about as much of their stories it has to offer, thanks to the mayonnaise plot the film suffers from several curses one of which is the 'too many characters, too little time' curse with five supers on the team each with their own personality they're left particularly nondescript they only have a few lines for plot before they have to battle. <br/><br/>It's not all bad as Affleck can be forgiven for looking a little bit lost as the bruised world-weary Bruce. It makes sense that Batman would normally be excited by all this intergalactic, high-stakes idiocy, as well as being left behind during some of the action. Maybe next time he will get to play with some non-CG exploding penguins.<br/><br/>VERDICT Fun and breezy at times, yet lumbered by the watery mayonnaise plotting offering little in the way of quality and reassuring a significant shortcoming of how forgettable it is."

","Justice League leaps over a number of DC movies, but its single bound isn't enough to shed the murky aesthetic, thin characters, and chaotic action that continue to dog the franchise."

","OK, if you grew up watching superhero cartoons (Spider-Man, Superfriends, etc.), try this test. Name some Spider-Man villains. Then try to remember some of the villains that fought the Justice League in the Superfriends.<br/><br/>OK, I'll start. Spider-Man villains: Rhino, Mysterio, Electro, Human Fly twins, Flying Dutchman, Lizard, Green Goblin, Dr. Octopus, Sandman, etc... Superfriends villains: um..., er..., maybe Brainiac? I honestly can't remember the plot or villain of one episode of that show even though I remember the invisible jet, Hawkman, that Native American dude who turns into a giant, etc.<br/><br/>Why the quiz? Well, I guess to demonstrate that the Marvel/DC ""entertainment value"" imbalance is not a new phenomenon. And Steppenwolf sure ain't gonna change this - he is the single least interesting antagonist ever seen on screen. Even Green Lantern had that dude with the big purple head. <br/><br/>Think about it. Ben Affleck as Batman. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Jason Momoa as Aquaman. Some nerdy guy, who has the ""Peter Parker- level insecurity and self-deprecating humor"" thing down better than Tobey Maguire, as the Flash. Some other guy as a robot.<br/><br/>All this potential and talent and practically all they do the entire movie is bicker with each other and fight computer-generated wasp- men - sorry, ""para-demons"" - and a computer-generated charisma vacuum named Steppenwolf (not to be confused with the presumably live-action charisma vacuum named Henry Cavill). <br/><br/>Many other low-star reviews of this movie have already listed its faults in accurate detail. It isn't substantial enough to have any deeper layers that they missed. <br/><br/>It's just horrible. Henry Cavill circles the drain with a completely emotionless portrayal of Superman. Ben Affleck continues his turn as a Batman who is the complete antithesis of anything he's been on TV, cartoons, or movies for the last half century or more.<br/><br/>Let's see... Aquaman doesn't really communicate with fish in this movie, he just manipulates water. Batman's suit is just awful. The only appearance of the Batmobile is at the very end when it is fighting some CGI tentacles on a CGI street in CGI Russia.<br/><br/>The Flash's costume is cool. I knew nothing about Cyborg going into the film and he was mildly interesting so I guess technically that makes him the least disappointing. Wonder Woman is the standout here, as in BvS and her own film, but her character seems wasted in this plot. There are some decent jokes, many of them self-referential, but every other aspect of the movie is cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>I give it two stars. One for Gal Gadot and one for Amber Heard. Subtract these two stars if you're not attracted to women. Or add them back if you like dudes - Henry Cavill and Jason Mamoa go shirtless a bit.<br/><br/>I haven't really added anything new to the discussion with my review, just want to vent. But I will tell you this. I went to the theater in a good mood and with very low expectations, based on all the negative reviews, and saw this only because there was nothing else playing that I was remotely interested in. <br/><br/>But with a movie this bad, no matter how low your expectations, it will still disappoint and you'll still walk out thinking ""How do so many people, ostensibly in the entertainment industry, invest so much time and money and collaborate on something for so long and produce something so completely devoid of entertainment?"". <br/><br/>Some have said this is better than Batman vs. Superman and/or Suicide Squad. I'm not so sure. Maybe. No, I don't think so. Even a completely miscast Lex Luthor and CGI brown turd, or a writhing 6,000 year old Cara Delevingne, are more interesting than Steppenwolf."
"godinevin","5","6","14","24 November 2017"," S for spoilers and no HOPE for DCEU
","The following review is rated 'S' for spoilers. The review mainly addresses the mistakes in the movie from the beginning to the credits scene. Throughout the movie, they DC was trying to make a rip of Avengers part 1. With a very similar narrative. Three mother boxes like the (six infinity stones), sending a pawn (Steppenwolf) before a super villain. (Darkseid) just like Thanos sending his pawns. Assembling of Avengers were instead of Nick Fury, Bruce Wayne takes the initiative of assembling the Justice league. Readers, find a similarity yet? Hence this has been a very puny move from DC as well as Snyder, were clearly he could've just taken a different story line. Yes, getting back to the details in the movie, again the title shot was such a rip-off of Marvels new title intro with just DC at one corner. SOMEONE got to change the guy who wrote the goddamn dialogues. Most of it was such cliché and made no sense most times. It was so awkward when Superman couldn't answer to a boy about the best thing he like on planet earth, it was followed by an awkward silence and cutting to next scene. However, Connie Neilsen's character Hippolyta and Jeremy Irons Alfred Pennyworth did their small yet brilliant on-screen time with some good piece of acting. The Amazonian fight sequel was the best fight sequence that stood out for me in the entire movie. The soundtrack was just good thanks, Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's Batman was such a fail not just in buffed up looks, common in his 50's with that weight the world's greatest detective is going to be super slow. Also, Batman's character was shown helpless most of the time, whereas in comics he always dealt with his own thing. A lot of simple logic and science was omitted or gone wrong in the movie which is a major factor that pulls down the DC cinemas. These tiny details do count and lead to the success of a film. For example, A dead man's flesh shrinks and appear to have stubble and long hair, whereas Superman even after a year of death or more still look so damn fresh with his hair still shiny and slicked back. Even under homeostasis, he's got to have a beard and long hair. Also, a major scene that went wrong is the 'resurrection of Superman'. The guy who was seen wearing a blue suit in the coffin, is reprise with a ripped black denim, HOW? Not to mention the third bother box with horrible CGI which looks like a metallic hollow tin. Also, the color tone and gradient kept shifting in the last fight scene which made the overall scene dull and less appealing. The CGI of covering up a Mustache has definitely gone wrong for Snyder in a lot of ways. Not only superman's face look like plastic molded, it also made him look like a teenager. Also, the movie made him a little extra powerful compared to the comics. Which is stupid in my opinion. The act of bringing in Lois lane was a good move but at the same time, Sups having a thing against Bats looked like Snyder have amnesia and completely forgot the Dawn of justice story line. That was a major plot hole. The on screen time with Bats and wonder woman is definitely dropping some hints in their future relationship, which was a good and light aspect of the movie. Bruce Wayne bonding over Clark as well providing room for Justice league was a good point mentioned in the movie. However, the credit scene was unnecessary in my opinion and it completely messed up the science were Ezra Miller's flash is shown running with his arms thrown sideways, by doing so he's wasting momentum which is going to slow him down incredibly. Hence, in a nutshell, Good try! DCU (:"
"samratmitrafeb14","5","6","14","23 November 2017"," Terrible, even by DC Standards
","Most of us will agree that DC Comic book superhero movies took a nose dive since Christopher Nolan bowed out with the Dark Knight Trilogy. Wonderwoman did elevate that sagging reputation that reached new lows with the Superman Vs Batman movie but this is comical. How did DC lose the plot when Marvel have been going from strength to strength on their franchise? Maybe better directors and editors are needed for such mind numbing high budget DC superhero movies, but this isn't worth your time or your money. Wait for cheaper streaming on Netflix, watch when you don't have not much else to do. Epic Fail."

","Sometimes our memory of a favorite show from our youth is better than watching the product now. Such was the case with the Superfriends kiddie 's show. I got off too Wonder Woman as a kid, but that was back in the Lynda Carter days. I liked it mainly because it was the first series that offered such a variety of heroes and villains. Watching it now though really exposed it's weaknesses. I realize it's a rehash of a 90s cartoon, but the lack of logic is unreal. For an extreme example of this, observe the episode involving the aliens from Venus. All DC follow the same simple formula. It opens with the baddies plotting a scheme. A combination of their members devise a plan. By the end of the show, the villains are caught, but always have a cheesy way to escape. On a positive note, Wonder Womans ""Dark Knight"" look comes off as XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS rehash. For me though, after the second of four episodes on the DVD, I watched the rest at double speed to save time and didn't miss a thing. The Legion of Doom bios in the extras are kinda neat but forget the stupid game option."

"Anurag-Shetty","10","5","11","17 November 2017"," Fast paced, action-packed & incredibly fun.
","Justice League takes place some time after the events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016). Batman/Bruce Wayne(Ben Affleck) is filled with hope by Superman/Clark Kent's(Henry Cavill) ultimate act of heroism. Batman asks for the help of his new acquaintance Wonder Woman/Diana Prince(Gal Gadot), to help him find more individuals with special abilities. Together, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash/Barry Allen(Ezra Miller), Aquaman/Arthur Curry(Jason Momoa) & Cyborg/Victor Stone(Ray Fisher), have to stop an imminent threat from destroying the world. <br/><br/>Justice League is an incredible film. Director Zack Snyder has masterfully brought together, Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman & Cyborg together on the big screen, for the first time. Snyder makes sure that, equal importance is given to each of the iconic superheroes. The action set pieces are fantastic, my personal favorite being the climactic one. The visual effects are awesome. The 3D definitely adds to the overall experience of the movie. The highlight of the film is the amazing performances of the main cast. Ben Affleck is brilliant as Batman/Bruce Wayne. It's nice to see Affleck portray a witty version of the Caped Crusader, this time around. Henry Cavill is spectacular as Superman/Clark Kent. When Cavill finally appears on screen, trust me, it's worth the wait. Amy Adams is great as Lois Lane. Gal Gadot is outstanding as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince. Gadot gives us another flawless performance, after Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016) & Wonder Woman(2017). Ezra Miller is awesome as The Flash/Barry Allen. Miller's portrayal of Barry Allen, is on par with Grant Gustin's portrayal of the same character, on The Flash(2014) TV series. Jason Momoa is excellent as Aquaman/Arthur Curry. Momoa's unforgettable performance, has me looking forward to his solo adventure Aquaman(2018), which is releasing next year. Ray Fisher is amazing as Cyborg/Victor Stone. Fisher portrays his character's vulnerabilities, with ease & panache. The interactions among all the six superheroes when they finally meet, is an absolute delight to watch. Jeremy Irons is hilarious as Alfred. Ciaran Hinds is effective as Steppenwolf. Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, J.K. Simmons, Amber Heard & Joe Morton are good as Martha Kent, Queen Hippolyta, Commissioner Gordon, Mera & Silas Stone, respectively. Justice League is a must watch for fans of the DC Extended Universe. Go, have a thoroughly good time!"

I thought the characters were well represented, the acting and story were compelling and the effects were great. Steppenwolf was largely a vehicle to bring the team together but that was fine by me.

They've got too many fans, and too many actions sequences, and too many different story lines. And they're all trying to save the world or universe.<br/><br/>Justice League was a fun watch. I think Batman is a cool character, and Ben Affleck plays him better than anyone before him. Aquaman is also a very intriguing character, and might even take away the spark from Batman in this. His solo movie was weak, and he is best as a sidekick. You get that rough and tough demeanor, without the stupid jokes. The other characters were cool too, but nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>I thought it was a funny movie, and though it had a lot of errors in it, it was a pretty fun watch.

","I will try to be brief. I bet at this time most people know that this isn't Snyder's complete vision of JL. Anyway, I really enjoyed it. It was FUN. Maybe I would've liked the ""tormented hero"" that Snyder usually presents, which is understandable in Man of Steel and in Batman VS Superman for obvious reasons. Superman was just beginning as a hero. A lot of people didn't accept him and he thought he didn't fit in this world. I get that big time. Then the Martha moment which most critics didn't get. I mean, the first time Batman plans to kill someone and when he's almost there, Superman says his and Bruce's mother's name. Which was a coincidence but still to Bruce it WASN'T. For so many obvious reasons. Then most critics pound on this movie because the villain is ""not that menacing"", not that strong...Steppenwolf was winning the whole time until Superman gets there!!!! So, the movie let's us really see how powerful and mighty Superman can really be and critics take it the wrong way. That is why Steppenwolf came in the first place out of the shadows. Because he knew Superman was dead and that he would've been beaten by him. I mean, Superman is supposed to be one of the strongest beings, period!!! Then we see him beat someone who is actually stronger than all the other heroes and we say bad things about the movie???? Yeah, I really loved this movie and I am also a Marvel lover so don't get me wrong. I thought the movie was perfect. Maybe if it had had more of Snyder it would've been PLUS perfect. Of course, this is just my opinion. I am so sad that this movie wasn't understood nor liked by a lot. I really had wished seeing JL2 soon!!!! Some critics don't know the characters well...and probably we will never get a second Justice League because of the bad publicity this one got. Still, I loved the movie!!!!"

"hoskinsfamily8","4","2","3","13 April 2018"," Poor story
","All the very legitimate complaints re: CGI, Superman's face, the film being too dark, literally not figuratively, etc...all that aside;
The biggest failure of this film is a poor storyline. 
The villain is lame. He's just some big ugly dude who lives somewhere in space and waits around for centuries for these 3 boxes to alert him when it's time to come back to Earth. His big goal is to use the 3 boxes to terraform the Earth into a replica of his home world, cause one ugly planet isn't enough for some reason.
So he does this and the way he is defeated is Superman beats him up a bit, doesn't kill him mind you, just roughs him up and breaks his throwing axe. Then poof, a bunch of his minions take and transport him back to his ugly home planet. The end. 
Oh and Aqua Man while he looks and act super cool, doesn't do much water work in this movie. One small scene where he holds back some harbor water while the team tries to climb out. Other than that you don't get much water work as he battles Steppenwolf. 
Flash is cute, kind of a super hero newbie. Not sure why with friends like Batman he doesn't parlay his help saving the world into a pardon/early release for his Dad, but maybe I'm too cynical. 
The film is TOO DARK, colors are drab and muted. The villain is too flat and lame. Frankly Bat Man is dragging things down. He's Uber grim, has no super powers and dresses like a bat. One of these superheroes is not like the others. Lose B man and punch up the storylines and things might work."

","Lifetime Justice League fan so this was finally on the big screen.<br/><br/>All was good with the film. Great the see the formation of the JL and the JL in action.

But that film would have been probably over four hours in length. <br/><br/>And the other thing for you JL haters is I personally think the JL/DC characters are too ""strong"". So that doesn't necessarily transfer too well to the big screen vs a comic. Hence, the over-CGI complaint too often heard. Marvel characters are a bit ""weaker"" (more human). <br/><br/>Overall, JL is a great movie effort. If you enjoyed BvS, Man of Steel, or WW, you'll definitely love this too."

","This movie, like many others before it, had great potential. How can one go wrong putting a team of superheroes together? Well, ask the people behind this movie as it was yet another action-and-super effects flop of a movie. Its very disappointing as one would expect a story like this one would pretty write itself, instead it seems huge efforts were spent in not letting it do just that, stunting its progress at every turn.<br/><br/>--Major Spoiler Alert
I was into it until the second half, when they decide to use one of them magic boxes to resurrect Superman (duh, why hadn't I thought of that, destroy the only good point to Superman vs Batman and bring the invincible back from the dead - pun intended). As soon as he makes his entrance, he effectively renders the mere existence of his new team mates to less than nothing, finding no difficulty in overpowering each of their individual gifts. Had Superman taken on the imminent threat on his own, it would have rendered the same result, so it really begs the question as to why they bothered making a team if they were going to bring Superman back (the only team member needed for this endeavor was Flash), eclipsing their usefulness in the process. Batman doesn't seem to serve any function or purpose whatsoever, especially after Superman's return. He seems exponentially weaker than in Super. vs Bat. not even being able to hold his own against some of the antagonist's minions (!) and coming off as incredibly frail and all around useless. I'm still trying to understand what Aquaman's purpose was in the grand scheme of things. Every character is severely under-developed, just seeming to appear out of nowhere. Flash just happens to have gotten his power from being hit by lightning, something that is mentioned over 2 secs, and it comes off as someone in the background ticking a list as he goes: ""explain source of power - check"", same for Cyborg. They use more than 2 secs to explain his path, but still avoid going into anything of any interest or relevance. Had they developed this further it would greatly have helped the overall impression of the movie.<br/><br/>Besides this, the second half of the movie seems badly planned and rushed to a quick ending, seemingly as quickly as the threat appeared, leaving as many unanswered questions as in the start. The sequence of events doesn't seem very thought through. I don't understand why they all have to hide in Batman's bat-cave while trying to locate a medieval looking pseudo-god of destruction, one would think there would be plenty clues left around to help locate him. Instead all we see is Cyborg flipping a holographic model of the planet around and around. Why the others just stand by idly I don't get. What purpose does it serve to have Aquaman waiting in dry dock? (Followed by, what does he even contribute or do in this movie?) And besides saving a family of 4, what purpose does Flash even serve in the final showdown? And oh so funny, he says 'Dostoevsky' thinking it means goodbye. Seriously? This is the ultimate best you could come up with in terms of comedy? <br/><br/>It seems like a project all-too-hastily rushed, probably being written on a daily basis as they were filming.<br/><br/>I still don't really understand B. Affleck as Batman. I have nothing against him as actor or his previous performances, but Batman really isn't an easy one to justify, he comes off as completely wrong, more like a Bizarro-Batman, he feels awkward even playing the role. Actually there isn't much I understand about this movie .. I give it 2 stars because it is mildly entertaining but you still come out of it feeling its 90mins of your life you're not getting back. I can't say I'm looking forward to the next chapter .."

","Let me start from how bad this movie is to me<br/><br/>Dark knight is still their best, Man of steel was bad, Dawn of Justice was sad, Suicide Squad was a waste of money, Wonder Woman was good, Now justice league just made Green Lantern movie Ok to watch. <br/><br/>Breakdown
Appreciation
<ul><li>All the characters are in one movie, a few concepts were enjoyable aaaaand it was not to long.</li></ul><br/><br/>Critic
<ul><li>I love Justice League, especially the animated movies. Reason? they provide sensible storylines that u can easily relate to, understand and want to know more about. But seeing this movie just made me feel like Warner Bros are just making movies for the profit and nothing else (Duuhhh?), they don't care if anything makes sense or not. It just like saying "" Give them the hand written ticket, they won't notice"". </li></ul><br/><br/>This movie is so disappointing to so many levels. The Batman is unsure, untrained in combat compared to Dawn of justice, has poor detective skills, easily trusts people now, Is a talkative (if u notice), not cautious of his I.D ( I mean he went to the flash as Bruce wayne), ridiculous motive and really doesn't do much in the movie. Cyborg (Who??), Oh Yeah he's just there as a robot with mixed feelings from the beginning to the end, lame dialogues, does, i'm guessing just less than 3 unimpressive hackings. Aquaman (*Sigh*), you sound cool and all but i couldn't understand your story (even when your hot girlfriend to-be tried explaining), I couldn't pinpoint your powers in the movie (is it lightning with the staff, can u control water, are u indestructable? super strength? I didn't see you talk to any starfish, I mean come on!. Wonder woman as usual doing all the lame fighting herself (At least in this movie), Lame dialogues (Can't they just take dialogues directly from comic books), ""Karl el son of Jorl el, remember who you are?"" (*sigh*) ""Don't make me do this"" (By the way she was going hit her wrists together to create a galactic orgasm but Superman grabs it and gives her ""head""). The Flash happened to be a rookie (Yeah that's it, you know how it goes from there). And then superman (Oh God! I love Henry Cavill so much as an actor but he's not always getting superman right or the directors are lame), He comes back from the dead through a mother box that was jump started by the rookie flash in the same gue has general zords, then can't remember anything but Batman and Louis Lane (They had a three-way once). The superman i saw seemed like the one that knows what's going on but wants to play along just to enjoy being evil to prove to the rest of the guys how awesome he is, he raced with The flash at the end (which to be honest was not necessary), and errrrr...Yeah he saved the day hands down. Steppin Wolf (pointless Villain with no sensible motive).<br/><br/>Yeah, Production wise? they could have done better for an Over-hyped movie (regardless of a whatever happened with the Snyder cuts). Storyline should be able to connect the audience more. Action scenes were bad, especially with The Batman and the Flash oh and Cyborg. Warner Bros should get someone who actually reads comic for creative understanding not just to get the job done. <br/><br/>I'm tired, i can't type anymore."
"sampah70","6","2","3","19 February 2018"," There you go again, DC.
","Beware, this is a DC movie. And like *nearly* all of them (movies + TV series) they're supposed to be dim-witted or just plain stupid. We don't mind to bend a bit common sense for outstanding action like in Marvel's (for example: acrobat fightings rather than just disabled the bad guy), but in DC's they're simply stupid cliches I can't even believe they'd passed it through.<br/><br/>Especially if you're a DC comics lover/nerd, you'll be severely dissapointed. Like Superboy in DC's TV series, he is not a nice scout-boy, but a mentally weak super-jerk, angry psycho who doesn't hesitate sacrificing the whole world to make his sweet-hart smile (what a romantic guy isn't he?). That kind of logic is versatile in all DC movies, so I didn't have too much confident as well in this movie (Justice League 2017).<br/><br/>And indeed my expectation sure prevails. If not because of Gal Gadot, maybe this movie deserved a negative rating.<br/><br/>And Lois Lane. Though this time is not utterly annoying like Reeve's Superman, why are they always cast an ugly and stupid Lois Lane?"
"lesleyharris30","3","2","3","14 January 2018"," A Major Let Down,
","Justice League is a poor movie with a terribly written plot and a talented, completely wasted cast. The only redeemable part of this novie is the cast itself, with every one being perfectly placed in to their respective roles, particularly newcomers Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller and J.K. Simmons as Aquaman, The Flash and Comissioner Gordon. However, literally everyone is not used well in their roles, no one's character feels substantial, they all have throwaway dialogue that simply helps the story move forward, without adding or representing them as characters, this comes down to unispired writing. <br/><br/>A movie like this is only as good as its villain, and Justice League gets a hurrendous one. Steppenwolf is possibly the worse villain I have seen in any superhero film, he is formulaic, bland and never does anything interesting or breathtakingly evil. I am never given a reason to feel in danger or to think that the crew might not be able to take him down, he is easy competition, and CiarÃ¡n Hinds tries his very best, but he is given absolutely nothing to work with. <br/><br/>It is simply unacceptable how bland and awful this movie is, they did not learn their lesson after Batman Vs. Superman and Sucide Squad, they did not see what worked with Wonder Woman. This type of an event film should have been handled with so much more grace, it shoud have been as big as the first Avengers, but the studio just threw it all together and gave us something that will simply float in to the abyss, despite featuring some of the best known, most recognised fictional characters of all time. <br/><br/>Left me feeling hopeless and annoyed. Forgettable and regrettable, Justice League is everything a superhero movie should not be.<br/><br/>Bruce Wayne must assemble a gang of heroes to take down an almighty threat. <br/><br/>

But when I heard he was returning for justice league I gave it a shot.<br/><br/>Although his return was way too rushed, it did help the movie a lot. Gal gadot (Wonder Woman ) was great of course. And the rest of the cast was fine except everything was so rushed, randomly throwing random ass characters into it. I just wished they had added another hour to make sense of it. But other then that, it was entertaining, and had a few laughs.<br/><br/>Although I do indeed think even with the little screen time Superman was given he still managed to carry the show.

"ryang-14167","6","1","1","19 November 2019"," Just another average comic book film, despite a very strong beating heart.
","Like most DC fans out there, I grew up watching old school cartoons. Super Friends, Batman: The Animated Series, Superman, and Justice League (2001) all had a part to play in the love we all share, not including the comic lines. And when DC decided to take a page from Marvel's playbook it became enticing to see how they'd pull what most believe is impossible: making a live action Justice League film.<br/><br/>Something as gargantuan as this would need multiple components to ensure its success. The most critical of those components are as follows:<br/><br/>1. Their respective heroes, built with backstory, traits, and motivation:
a.) This must also include the team dynamic that merges all three.
b.) Included should be a strong motivation for the team assembling.
2. Strong world building that capitalizes on previous films.
3. A unique, compelling villain that puts the team dynamic to the test.
4. Clear and concise direction on where this universe wants to go.<br/><br/>Does Justice League (2017) fulfill these objectives and create something that can rival Marvel's monstrous success? The answer varies based off your own personal stance, but in the end it's a mixed bag only made worse by studio interference and issues behind the scenes.<br/><br/>
Not long after the death of Superman, the world becomes the target for an alien invasion when an intergalactic being known as Steppenwolf begins a crusade to hunt down artifacts known as Motherboxes and terraform the planet in the process. It's up to the Justice League to form up to put a stop to Steppenwolf.....and that's as far as the plot goes.<br/><br/>While the formula is simple, and at times effective, it's not as strong as it should be here, thanks mostly to a major lack in narrative consistency. The first half hour feels incomprehensibly rushed in order to introduce each member of the league as fast as possible, with obvious portions missing (more on that later) that lead to awkward edits and moments that don't feel like they belong. Pacing is another serious issue, as some scenes feel shuffled around. The film starts off Batman capturing a parademon and basically force-feeding exposition to the audience as to what's going on. What follows is a scene of Wonder Woman stopping terrorists from blowing up a building; while the subtext of terrorists coming from the woodworks in the wake of Superman's death is commendable, it still doesn't explain the pacing and random placement of the scene.<br/><br/>This is quite frequent throughout the film, and the obvious culprit is Warner Bros.<br/><br/>Rumors of Zack Snyder being fired or outright leaving the project due to personal issues abound, but regardless Warner Bros. brought in Joss Whedon to help finalize the film by way of adding ample doses of humor and changes to the story. After the utter grimness that was BvS, the studio aimed for more humor and lightheartedness. The story goes Snyder had roughly 3 1/2 hours of footage, of which Whedon compressed into 2 hours, resulting in a film that greatly suffers under the weight of time crunch. It's made very clear which scenes are Snyder's and which are Whedon's, from the slo-mo shots to the comic relief added last-minute (of which is painfully obvious at times).<br/><br/>The studio tampering doesn't stop there, as the main villain is perhaps the biggest narrative blight in the film, through pacing and mere presence. Steppenwolf is, universally, the worst villain in any modern comic book adaptation. He's hollow, uninteresting, and devoid of any personality that makes him an eligible threat to the Justice League. It doesn't help that he's entirely CG, and can't even be elevated by Ciarán Hinds unconvincing voice capture. Supposedly he had much more of a menacing presence in the original cut, but was cut down to serve the two hour runtime. The only positive mark that can be said about him is that he does get quite a few fight scenes, at least one with each member of the league.<br/><br/>When looking past the studio problems, the more fascinating elements begin to emerge. For starters, the League's dynamic with one another is top notch. While not all members get enough time to shine, their camaraderie and teamwork really makes them feel like a single unit. Bruce conversing with Aquaman, Bruce tutoring Barry Allen/Flash, Flash fighting alongside Cyborg, Wonder Woman fighting alongside all of them. It's just a beauty to behold, something ripped straight from the 2001 animated show and done justice, pun intended.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything too significant there are individual moments as well for each character that help flesh them out in the DCEU world, supplying the right amounts of bravado and fervor that's much needed after the dark void that was BvS. Barry Allen in particular is given the the more fleshed out backstory, albeit in crash course mode; by the end there's even a small payoff for his character's central arc. Bruce Wayne/Batman is a more PG version of himself than before, relying way less on stabbing thugs and blowing stuff up and instead playing custodian to the League itself along with Alfred's guidance. We no longer see a grizzled man pushing the limits, but instead see him acknowledge his own limits and mortality after being surrounded by gods and monsters. It's a unique paradigm shift for the character, and is sure to cause some division amongst the fanbase.<br/><br/>Aquaman and Cyborg make awesome additions to the team with their unique personalities and powers, but aren't given enough space to breath in an already shallow runtime. Aquaman is given a very brief crash course introduction, and Cyborg's introduction is all but glossed over with only the vaguest explanation of how he received his powers. Of the established heroes Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg were properly introduced until this movie, so that's three origins/backstories that need realizing before the plot can move forward, which is already hard because of the hackneyed runtime. The only new hero that works is the Flash because he gets the lion's share of backstory. This not-too-effectively makes the first half hour of the film a crash course introduction to the team.<br/><br/>(By now you've heard the words ""crash course"" multiple times, because that's the only appropriate way to describe the majority of the film. It condenses too much information and attempts to make it work within the allotted time given. Secret Origins, the pilot to the 2001 animated show, was a clear inspiration to the movie, but even when divided into three parts the pilot served as a well-balanced rendition of what the team should be.)<br/><br/>Justice League mostly nails its heroes, even if some feel rushed with little to no backstory. Their dynamic is spot-on, but their motivation is shoddy thanks to a villain who just doesn't provide enough challenge, let alone any personality or charisma. The world building is done right after BvS, opening multiple avenues by the film's end (even though those ends are unlikely to be explored now that DC is attempting another soft reboot of their universe.) In the end the runtime is the cardinal sin that damns most of the final product into being just another average comic book film, despite a very strong beating heart."

","After watching Justice League after it released at cinemas, I felt disappointed - Zack Snyder was sadly un-able to finish production on the film so Joss Whedon of Avenger fame filling in to finish the movie - no brainer, right?<br/><br/>Wrong, the lighter tone shift and lack of direction in Justice League made the film painfully bland and this led to some baffling scenes that I shook my head in disbelief. Say what you will about Zack's dark interpretation of Batman/Superman but at least Man Vs Steel and Batman Vs Superman had an edge of taking a darker approach to this cinematic universe rather than trying to appeal to everybody (like a Marvel movie) but falling short of doing so.<br/><br/>A particular disappointment is how the promotion material hinted at large scale battle scenes and introduction of more DC characters when this was quite misleading. <br/><br/>Characters like Flash, Cyborg and Aqua Man are rushed in with short moments of development but nothing too deep. Batman is also underplayed which is a shame considering Ben Affleck's performance in the DCEU so far. <br/><br/>As for the good stuff - the visuals are good (especially during Flash sequences), some of the action scenes are entertaining and it slots together to create a fun enough superhero movie but the lack of depth, gravitas and direction makes it particularly bland when it could have been so much more than just 'good'. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and watch Wonder Woman instead"

"rolandjordaan2","7","1","1","14 September 2018"," Justice League - Spoiler Free Review
","Man of Steel was awful, Batman v Superman wanted to make me give up watching movies and now I have seen Justice League...this movie wasn't bad, don't get me wrong, there was still a lot wrong with this movie, but at the very least I can say that this is a very entertaining film, not only that, but it did fix most the things that were wrong with the previous installments. The trailers made this movie look as if it was going to follow the Marvel route of action/comedy and it doesn't, this is still a rather dark movie; what they have done though is give sense of humours to the characters, giving them more likeability and making them much easier to route for than before. Ben Affleck, of course, returns as Batman/Bruce Wayne and although I was in the minority who thoroughly disliked his portrayal in the previous film, I actually didn't mind him here. Not only did they give his character a sense of humour, but they also made him a lot more human; in this film, Bruce Wayne knows that he is just a normal person with human limitations; he acknowledges this, bringing a vulnerability to his character and making him a lot more identifiable. Gal Gadot again fits perfectly into the role of Wonder Woman, her action scenes are great and her character is sexy as hell, more than that though, from the get-go she is an intricate part of the team; Black Widow has always been part of The Avengers, but her character has always been interchangeable, eye candy that could basically be killed off at any second without any major repercussions to the plot: that is definitely not the case here. The new characters are of course Barry Allen/The Flash, Arthur Curry/Aquaman and Victor Stone/Cyborg; Barry Allen is the comic relief character in this movie, and for the most part, it works fine; most his lines are jokes, sure, but that's how his character is written and it fits fine, even during the battle scenes, when he does throw a comical one-liner, it never takes you out of the scene, because you can actually believe that that is something that character would say in that situation. Then looking at Aquaman: Jason Mamoa is awesome! This is probably the best role I've ever seen him in, his character is likeable, tough as hell and Jason Mamoa just seems to be having the time of his career; I could maybe have done with a few less ""yo bro"" or other slang terms that got increasingly more as his character progressed, but that's a nitpick. Then we get to Cyborg...I, unfortunately, did not like Cyborg. Not only is this character a wet blanket, but his character has zero likeability, zero personality and every line he speaks is basically just him explaining the plot, another character I REALLY hated was the villain, Steppenwolf; this character is what kept this movie from being good, everything is wrong with him: the CGI is awful, every line he has is cliched supervillain talk, his motives have nothing new...Ivan Ooze from the 1993 Power Rangers movie: better villain than this guy. Finally getting past the characters and looking at the movie itself though, I will say that even though we spend the majority of the first act being introduced to new characters, this movie was still a lot more focused than the previous installments, and therefore was able to hold my attention for the whole of its two hour running time. The action scenes are brilliantly choreographed, easy to follow and fun to watch; the heart of this movie is the team though; I will go so far as to say, even though this was DC's first official team-up movie, there is already a stronger feeling of unity between the team than Marvel has been able to create since starting the MCU; every character has his place, every character has a purpose and what's more is they work together as a team, there are no power struggles, sure there are inner conflicts, but never do they let that cloud their judgement from what their joint goal is...these are superheroes actng the way superheroes should act, putting the needs of the many before their own. Final thoughts, as I said in the beginning, there are still problems with this film, the villain was a huge letdown, some of the CGI is really bad, some line delivery is rather cringe-worthy...but even with that taken into account, I still fully recommend you see this movie, because I get a feeling that there are actually great things yet to come from the DCU after all...watch your back, Marvel."
"scott-sw","7","1","1","8 September 2018"," Not as bad as most suggest
","Justice League, like so many of the comic book superhero movies, is very average, but hardly has bad as many critics and fans suggest. DC Comics/Warner Brothers has been playing catch-up to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, although it has not been as nearly consistent in quality.
Bruce Wayne/Batman has been invigorated with hope since he witnessed Clark Kent/Superman sacrifice himself to stop Doomsday in Batman v. Superman. He is working with Diana Prince/Wonder Woman to build a team of heros to deal with the growing problem of powerful enemies. He recruits the elusive Arthur Curry/Aquaman, Barry Allen/Flash, and Cyborg. While the Flash (Ezra Miller) is on board quickly (no pun intended), Curry and Cyborg are a little reticent.
While this team is being assembled by Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), the menacing Steppenwolf returns to the Earth to recover the four Mother Boxes left on the Earth. The Amazons have one, the Atlanteans have the other, while two others remain missing. As he moves in on them, the newly formed Justice League takes action. However, they lack a certain something to defeat the powerful being.
The only choice, they assume, is to resurrect Superman. It is obvious he comes back, but he is not right. Superman must remember who he is and what he represents. Kal-El/Clark/Superman retreats back to Smallville to rediscover who he is while the remaining Justice League take a gamble on defeating Steppenwolf.
First, the bad. The movie was a bit rushed, not giving enough exposition to set up the plot. The audience really has to pay attention to a quick-paced story. Another Achilles heal to the franchise is stealing ideas. In the early days of Marvel, they borrowed ideas from DC. As their cinematic universes expand, the opposite is happening. The World Boxes are the DC answer to the Infinity Stones of the MCU, and Steppenwolf is Loki, although a bit more sinister.
On the other hand, we have some good conflict, and decent characters. While Cyborg lacks imagination, Erza Miller gives Flash his usual smart-ass comments and humor laced with a little fear. Even better is Jason Momoa's interpretation of Arthur Curry/Aquaman that defies the culture of ridicule and jokes of his uselessness by being stronger and tougher. Henry Cavill, however, really shows a little more depth as he renews relationships with his mother (Diane Lane) and Lois (Amy Adams).
Do stick around for a couple of post-credit scenes, because one of them sets up for whatever the sequel will be. Sure, their writers could take some lessons from the MCU writers, but this DC outing is pretty decent."
"davebartle","9","1","1","8 August 2018"," Thoroughly enjoyable
","After suffering superhero fatigue from watching Iron Man 25, or whatever number the Marvel Iron Man remakes have reached now, I thoroughly enjoyed the more grown up Justice League. The DC Universe doesn't feel the need to crack a joke every 20 seconds like Marvel movies(10 in Thor), this makes it feel more like reading a DC comic book which often dealt with darker themes. The colour palette in the movie is brilliantly done, remiscent of the beautiful airbrushed artwork of the 80's comic books I read as a child.
The criticism of the bad guy is valid, he is boring and generic, but then again, so is the bad guy in countless cape movies. 
The one thing I found jarring was the casting of Jason Mamoa as Aquaman, I couldn't think of many actors worse suited to the role. As I stated earlier, the movie's visuals are highly reminiscent of 80's artwork, so why you wouldn't cast an Aquaman that looked and acted like hero we grew up with is hard to understand and may negatively affect the upcoming movie. Maybe enough GOT fans will up the attendance.
Anyway, ignore the critics, unless you are a fanatical Marvel movie fan you will probably enjoy this movie."

Don't get me wrong...it's certaibly worth watching, but I thought the special effects were almost sub-par. The most refreshing part of this movie was how they made The Flash into a kick-ass super hero. If you watch the Flash series on the WB channel, I think you can admit they have him in a ridiculous outfit. This movie steps it up 10-fold and make him...well, awesome.

","Just watched this movie on DVD. I did not go to see it at the cinema because of the poor reviews. I have not watched Batman v Superman for similar reasons so I did not understand a lot of the back story to Justice League. Overall, I thought the movie was good: not great but good. The humour was appropriate, the fight scenes were exciting and the story was okay as well. CGI was a bit dodgy at times but it did not stop me rewinding and re-watching all the fight scenes. And I did not have to fast forward at all - always a good sign. I even cried when Superman came back. I personally thought some of the character chemistry a bit forced but that might just be me. I know people have criticized Steppenwolf (and I understand why) but I thought he was okay in a 1980s video game 'boss battle' sort of way - no real personality or back story - but tough and hard to beat which I think is all you want in a fantasy superhero movie. Overall a good and satisfying movie: definitely 7 out of 10 (possibly 7.5)."
"megannea","5","1","1","7 May 2018"," Too much lost potential
","The movie as a whole was not terrible and had potential, but I was certainly never on the edge of my seat and overall the movie left things to be desired. <br/><br/>To start, the character development was especially lacking. I never felt any particular connection to any of the characters, and they were all fairly un-relatable and very serious. A large portion of the movie was spent actually getting the team together, and there was little focus on defeating the actual villain. Too many characters were introduced all at once, with no time to develop their characters sufficiently. <br/><br/>This series as a whole could have benefited from one (maybe 2) more movies focusing on individuals before the release of this one. They essentially shoved Cyborg's whole back story in this movie in brief flashbacks and story telling, whereas he would have especially benefitted from his own movie before this one. His back story is exciting, would develop his character more if they released a movie about it, and would have segued nicely into Justice League and the main struggle. In fact, his back story and his father's discoveries were crucial to the development of the main obstacles the heroes had to overcome in this movie. Having a movie mostly about Cyborg would have given them the opportunity to better set the stage for the plot and villain in this movie. They basically lost this opportunity because they gave the key points of his back story, rendering a movie about it unnecessary. Perhaps they'll have a separate movie about him in the future, but it would likely be after Justice League in the timeline, and not pursue his back story. I also think Poseidon could have benefitted from his own movie as well, but it's not too late for him. <br/><br/>My other big issue was the villain. He and his purpose was unconvincing, and the gravity of the situation felt understated. Never does he strike fear into the hearts of the audience, and no one is really ever convinced that he is going to even come close to winning. Unlike the Avengers movies, where the characters often endure personal struggles and both personal and public failures, these characters very predictably defeat the villain. Not that I am rooting for the deaths of characters or extras in the movie, but that may have helped emphasize the struggle and the gravity of the villain's goal. I don't believe the Justice League lost a single civilian throughout the entirety of the movie. Additionally, the villain's power seems to largely come from these boxes that produce this weird glowing/electric-looking vine-like growth (similar to what is emitted from the Enchantress in Suicide Squad). It shows the literal reach of his power, and it really doesn't reach that far, nor does it seem to do anything besides cover or knock down some stuff. And it glows. That's about it. <br/><br/>The movie also played a bit like a video game with a very direct path and storyline. I've read other reviews where people used this to mention CGI issues (I do not have the eye for that, so I won't comment there), but I mean this in the sense of the plot itself. The villain is really not very mobile, aside from making appearances here and there based on the location of the boxes. He lodges himself in one central lair, and the heroes have to work their way through various ""levels"" per se, to get to the Boss's fairly isolated lair, and defeat him in the one dungeon. The fight scene does not feel very dynamic, as this ""lair"" does not create an interesting enough or versatile enough environment for an exciting fight scene to occur.<br/><br/>As I said, largely due to the aforementioned complaints, I did not find the movie exciting, and felt there was a lot of lost potential with the lack of plot and character development. I was initially hopeful for this movie courtesy of Wonder Woman, which I quite enjoyed, but I suppose I'll have to hold on to that hope for whatever their next movie is."

","This film is much better than BVS and Suicide Squad, But that doesn't say much, unlike those films this one actually had reasons for behind the scenes mishaps at the wake of Snyder's Family tragedy and Whedon's direction. Which in the end delivers a jumbled mess of a film, but unlike BVS and Suicide Squad there is a love of the material going into the film that I previously couldn't find in the other films. The cast is exceptional Gal Gadot fresh off of Wonder Woman is still killing it with her performance, Jason Mamoa is fun and charming in his role as Aquaman, Fisher as Cyborg gives a grounded and comic accurate portrayal and even Cavill is starting to have more fun as the Man Of Steel. Afleck is good, but he looks like he's much less interested than in BVS which is a disappointment to me, Miller gives a funny and nice performance as The Scarlet Speedster, But I personally as a Flash(TV) fan can't see anyone but Grant in the role, which I know is wrong, but Grant does a great job. The visuals are a huge downgrade from BVS and Wonder Woman and it feels like playing a video game sometimes, Steppanwolf is a terrible villain who doesn't pose a threat at all, and the plot of collecting the motherboxes also feels like a video game plot, but in the end it's still nice to some of the best superheroes ever on screen together, it could've been so much more, but for what we got it was okay, and I'd watch it again."

Just look at her.<br/><br/>Ben Afleck is awesome as always, and I actually prefer the more modest, yet still mighty batman that he brought to Justice League.<br/><br/>The only two things I am not very satisfied with, is that we didn't get enough of the great Jeremy Irons, and that the cyborg character was pretty much irrelevant to the story.<br/><br/>Whiny geeks will always whine no matter what.

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","4","1","1","2 April 2018"," The culmination of all of DC's superhero woes. At least it's out of their system
","Every time a new superhero movie comes out lately, we wonder if this will be the point that the market finally hits oversaturation, that audiences and critics will just stick a fork in the genre. When Marvel Studios releases that new movie, we tend to pleasantly discover there's more places these films can go; when DC Entertainment releases that new movie, we wonder how the genre hasn't died already.<br/><br/>Although ""Wonder Woman"" turned out excellently, ""Justice League"" suggests it may end up being the lone exception. Despite bringing together Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Batman (Ben Affleck), Superman (Henry Cavill), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), The Flash (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), the film offers nothing new or exciting to the genre and barely executes the formula to satisfaction.<br/><br/>Seeing Marvel bring multiple beloved heroes together in 2012's ""The Avengers"" was exhilarating; DC's hero assembly evokes ambivalence at best. The difference lies in ""Avengers"" being a true culmination, a few years of (well-made) solo films introducing us to the characters. DC introduced us to Cavill's Superman in 2013's ""Man of Steel,"" added a brand-new Batman in ""Batman v. Superman"" (2016) and managed to squeak in ""Wonder Woman"" mere months before this film's release. What does that leave us with? A big contrast between scenes featuring Gadot and scenes without her, three completely new characters and a familiar Superman who isn't even in three-quarters of the movie.<br/><br/>A film directed by Zack Snyder, co-written and partially directed by Joss Whedon (the first two ""Avengers"" films) and executive produced by Christopher Nolan surely shouldn't be this average, but perhaps that's exactly why it is. With the mediocrity of past films nipping at their heels, DC and Warner Bros. took some panicked measures to right the ship, making ""Justice League"" a tonal blur that every so often hits on a good laugh or a good character moment before returning to predictable status quo.<br/><br/>The real issue with ""Justice League"" is that even with three new, theoretically exciting characters, every element of the film feels reused and retreaded. Cyborg and Batman are basically Tony Stark/Iron Man made more brooding and split in two, The Flash is that young excited-to-be-there character we've seen in Ant-Man and the latest Spider-Man and the jury's still out on Aquaman.<br/><br/>Story-wise, the threat in the film comes from yet another supernatural, other-worldly being in Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds), who seems no more intimidating than the other villains DC has sent us recently, and he's after the three Mother Boxes, which will form the Unity, giving him the power to turn earth into his hellscape (a plot that feels straight out of various Marvel films). Why this particular all-powerful villain requires the teamwork of all these heroes isn't immediately apparent.<br/><br/>Maybe DC is simply late to the party on some of these superhero movie ideas so what's generally fine simply feels stale. Maybe the action is cooler and the jokes funnier than they seem, but DC is trying to too quickly overcome its past letdowns. Perhaps the difference between DC and Marvel right now is credibility; whereas Marvel seems two steps ahead of where its audiences are at, DC is two steps behind what its audiences expect. One is proactive, the other reactive. <br/><br/>There's some promise in the DC Entertainment Universe. ""Justice League"" hints at exciting new worlds in Atlantis and its reboot of the Green Lantern Corps universe; Ezra Miller seems capable of carrying his own humorous coming-of-age superhero film; and Wonder Woman is perhaps the most beloved hero on screen right now. With a little patience and a clear, committed vision, the second ""Justice League"" should outdo the first.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
"p-jonsson","9","1","1","2 April 2018"," Great, straightforward Super Hero movie.
","This was my type of Super Hero movie. Simple, straightforward plot without much social nonsens and preaching. Little in terms of the all too common whining and sel pitying by the heroes. They are heroes all the way without any nonsensical vendettas or moral stuff (mostly). There is an episode with a temporary memory lapse and some unnecessary slowdown but it is quickly dealt with.<br/><br/>The movie was criticized for its ""overuse of CGI"". Well, go watch another movie then for Christ sake! News Flash: It is a Super Hero movie! There are supposed to be a lot of CGI in a super hero movie. Personally I enjoyed every second of the FX loaded scenes.<br/><br/>I am quite happy to finally see a real Super Hero movie and especially to see Batman and Superman again after that utterly abysmal train wreck Batman v. Superman.<br/><br/>I liked all the heros in this movie. The Flash was a bit silly at times but it was bearable. Gal Gadot is as hot (I had to say it) as ever as Wonder Woman. There are a few comical moments but luckily they are not overdone. Aquaman accidentally sitting on Wonder Woman's ""truth lasso"" was quite hilarious actually.<br/><br/>The SF was generally great. I really liked the explosive action scenes. The colorful tendrils that invaded the land around Steppenwolf's lair was a bit si-so though. They should have kept them just black and red at least.
Steppenwolf himself was okay. From a distance he was pretty great but up close (and there was really too many up close scenes of him) he looked...not so great, especially when talking.<br/><br/>There are a couple of stupid faults of course. Usually involving the good guys just standing around looking while the bad guy screws them. Leaving the, obviously, all important third mother box unguarded and the lust looking stupid when Steppenwolf grabbed it was a real low.<br/><br/>Anyway, I really liked this movie. I do hope we get more like it."
"dmc101","6","1","1","24 March 2018"," Superheroes are Becoming a Running Joke
","Taken one by one, the superheroes from the comics are typically presented as mostly serious, with some exceptions. When they group them however, only X-Men has managed to pull off the affair without a constant running punchline about the fact of how silly they are. <br/><br/>In this movie, we see a gathering of heroes, some we know and some we might not be too familiar with (if we are not comic book fans). For those of us not so familiar with certain comic book heroes, there's really not enough backstory to these folks to create any connection with them. Once you get to know more about them, you begin to understand just why this is the case - they do things that are just silly and their universes don't seem to co-exist, however somehow they tried to mesh these folks into one universe. <br/><br/>In a world where you have Superman, you don't need Batman or Wonder Woman. They pale in comparison to him in every way and the movie basically emphasizes that fact, when they aren't lampooning the very idea of each character's existence in the first place (which to me seems to be a bit of a ploy to show some compromise with the non-super hero folks out there on just how silly the entire concept is). <br/><br/>It's telling that Gadot is the best actor on the screen not named Jeremy Irons. Affleck is ok, but he became Ben Affleck somewhere in the middle of the movie, and I never saw him as Bruce Wayne afterward.<br/><br/>Superman is mostly CGI it seems. You can tell the behind shots of him aren't even him, and the frontal shots have his face superimposed (no pun intended). Could they not get the actor or was the body suit that over the top? It's not like the actor doesn't have the body for it (unlike Ben who never bared chest in this film, no doubt due to how flabby he's become since filming Batman, you could see the spare tire from the side shots and the fake muscle suit didn't hide that well). <br/><br/>The Flash was completely out of place here. They should have picked a better hero. His humor was ill placed, poorly timed and they didn't seem to know when to let it go. <br/><br/>Aquaman was interesting only because the actor is made for these types of roles. Still, the street lingo he used didn't really jive with his history and environment. Dude hangs out in fishing villages and ancient cities yet he talks like he's a gym rat who frequents Starbucks. At least Thor has the accent and some cultural inflection and prose. <br/><br/>I don't even remember the name of the half human/half droid guy. He didn't make any sense to me, seemed like a Transformers thing. <br/><br/>All in all, there was too much unrecoverable death (again) with the Amazons and yet humanity itself didn't suffer a single casualty. So it appears that all the power that's basically ""pure power"" wasn't enough to beat one superhero, because face it - Superman didn't need the others to win this battle."
"rutzelb","10","1","1","17 March 2018"," This is what I'm,talking about
","Since the passing of Superman Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) feels the world needs help to ward off the evil Steppenwolf who is in need of three boxes that contain ultimate power. He needs those boxes to destroy the world and start over: his way. The boxes were hidden so evil could not find them and destroy the world. Bruce Wayne needs to field a team of super-heroes to combat Steppenwolf and make sure he doesn't get the three boxes. He does this with Wonder Woman's help, but feels it is not enough and the team comes up with a plan to revive Superman/Clark Kent (Henry Cavill) with the help of one of the boxes they have in their possession. <br/><br/>This is the movie we have been waiting for. We didn't know how Superman would come back and this plan using one of the most powerful boxes in the world seemed like it would work mostly because no one really knows the makeup of Superman from the planet Krypton. <br/><br/>The Justice League: Batman, of course, Jason Momoa as Aquaman/Arthur Curry; Ezra Miller as the Flash/Barry Allen, Gal Gadot as Womer Woman/Diana Prince and Ray Fisher as Cyborg/Victor Stone.<br/><br/>There are two winners in here: the CGI as it is some of the best I have ever seen and the story about the return of Superman. Steppenwolf is a CGI creation and Ciaran Hinds is the voice of Steppenwolf. (Could have fooled me. I thought he was a real guy)<br/><br/>Notables: Jeremy Irons as Alfred, Batman's right hand man; Diane Lane as Martha Kent; Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Connie Nielsen as the Amazon Queen Hiippolyta, Wonder Woman's mother; J.K. Simmons as Commissioner Gordon; Amber Heard as Mera an Amazon warrior; and Joe Morton as Silas Stone, Victor's father. <br/><br/>The story is very good and we knew it would have to be epic. (Destruction of the world would seem to do it) The acting all around is spot on. We see many interactions among our superheroes and we wished there were more. <br/><br/>This is for us: We Believers who grew up on Superman, Batman etc comics and wished it wasn't fiction and when we read the comic book we snuggled into our private reality and wished the comic book story never ended. Actually, it never ends for us as like I said: we are Believers. <br/><br/>Stay until some of the credits run to see a race between Superman and the Flash.<br/><br/>This is a great story of the return of Superman and some of us Believers did have that box of Kleenex handy just in case. Now we can wish for more Superman movies with or without Batman, but with is okay, too. Now we can add Superman to the complete Justice League. This is what I have been talking about. Been too long. Kudos. (10/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No.<br/><br/> Humor: Yes. Banter within the justice League members. One of the best line is when Flash/Barry asks Bruce Wayne/Batman what his super power is. Wayne replies: ""I'm rich.""<br/><br/>Language: One SOB and one S-word was heard. <br/><br/>Rating: A"
"judywalker2","1","1","1","17 March 2018"," Worst movie ever
","I have come to the conclusion that the writers, directors and producers of DC movies don't like the characters. The Batman movies (not the ones with Affleck) were okay, but the villains and minor characters were more interesting than Batman. Green Lantern was ruined by silliness. Superman was a good start ruined by the introduction in Batman versus Superman of Affleck and the worst Lex Luther ever. Now JL the worst movie every made. Bad story, dumb villain and bad acting by everyone. DC for some reason thinks if they just made everything dark and video game quality that they will make a successful movie. Their wrong. Marvel has bested them because they care about the characters. Makes the audience care by letting you get to know them. Yes they have humor but its appropriate, not annoying. I feel sorry for Gal Gadot who is good as Wonder Woman and the Amazon women who are great. I also feel sorry for Henry Cavil who is a great Superman, but really wasted and acted poorly in this film. I wish DC would just stop. Wait a few years and find someone who really likes their characters. They also need to find better Batman and stick with a real good JL beginning story, maybe with Martian man hunter. Who ever they pick needs to go back and watch the animated series and not spend so much time on obscure comic books. Its the series that endured JL to its fans."

"ioshadha","8","1","1","5 March 2018"," The Problem is the Audience
","Let's get started on this topic by giving a rating of 8 for Justice League.... It's not perfect by any means, but for me as a true DC/Marvel comic fan I appreciate Justice League more than say the most recent Marvel's Thor - Rangrong which in my opinion was a big joke and a comedy than anything else. If you ask most people (the general audience) however, see this the other way around and this is why - <br/><br/>Let's get the obvious out of the way first... Justice League as I mentioned, by no means perfect. As many have indicated the plot and some character development could have been better... what Justice League needed in my opinion is more screen time. The movie seriously lacked screen time to bring a group six superhero characters together therefore affecting the whole flow and the plot of the movie... But the movie manged to maintain true DC essence in it to a degree. DC differ from Marvel from being more dark and twisted in their stories...Justice League in many ways maintained what DC is all about. Many 
(the general audience) would see this as being boring or non entertaining but if you know DC then you know what you are up against. Batman vs Superman had a similar tone to Justice League... again many criticized that movie too.<br/><br/>The problem here come down to the blockbuster earnings. Marvel has been making some healthy $$ figures on recent movies like the whole Avengers series and other solo movies such as Iron Man. Studios don't care about maintaining the original essence of DC or Marvel comics... for them the the success lies in the $$ figure. So, how do they earn more $$s? Well the answer is of course developing movies to capture a wider audience than the true DC/Marvel comics fan base out there... My friend rated more recent Guidance of the Galaxy and Thor - Rangrong very high... I asked him why. His view was simple - it fun, lite and great entertainment with some hardcore CGI - you walk out of the theater happy... nothing wrong with his view... but he has no clue whatsoever what DC or Marvel comics are all about - have never read them. He would easily mixed up Marvel and DC characters. And that's the general audience I'm talking about... And this is how Thor - Rangrong gets its high ratings and blockbuster $$s.<br/><br/>By this definition Marvel by default has the edge when it comes to entertainment as Marvel comics have more fun/brighter element in the original comics in comparison to DC. Iron Man's and the Guidance of the Galaxy success were around these elements - Audience like this. However, studios try to apply the same theme across on movies such as Thor - Rangrong which in my opinion led to jeopardizing the Thor character to a comedy which was disgrace and ended up in a disaster regardless of it successful blockbuster earnings. Only a Marvel fan would see this but no the general audience. You can see how ratings on Thor - Rangrong go either very high (general audience) vs very low (Marvel fans).<br/><br/>So, this my take on how DC and Marvel movies will continue to the future... Studios will try to make more $$s. Marvel was first in this game... they sort of got the formula right making more $$s by focusing on entertainment than maintaining the true essence of the original comics. DC will follow the lead at a certain point. Its going to be interesting to see how DC does this if they wanted to maintain the dark and twisted nature of DC comics which is what differentiate DC from Marvel. The end result however, is that Marvel and DC movies will gradually loose the true essence of the original comics and what they were all about."

","The most epic movie in the new DC Universe! Or, that's what it was supposed to be. I thought the movie wasn't as bad as some people are suggesting. It is very exciting to see some of your favorite superheroes beat the sh*t out of a villain. Even though it was a very generic villain. The resurrection of Superman was a strong part of the movie, even if it was just a reason to make Superman fight other superheroes.
However, Justice League had so much more potential than this, and most of the reviews are so negative, because people expected more of it (and rightly so). 
Zack Snyder kicked off the new DCU with Man of Steel (2013) and tried to give it the same dark, ominous feeling as Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy had. Unfortunately, he failed. He tried it again with Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), did slightly better, but still didn't come close to Nolan's work. With Justice League, it seems he has tried a different approach. There's a lot more comedy going on in this movie. The tension between the heroes, cheesy one-liners, you name it. At times, I had the feeling I was watching a Marvel movie. But the only character that made it feel natural was Barry Allen/The Flash. When any other character attempted to make a joke, it just felt awkward and unnatural. So the comedy route didn't work out that well either for Snyder.
After Man of Steel and Batman vs. Superman being average movies with very little sense of direction, Justice League continues that same trend. And I feel like the only one to blame for the lack of direction is, indeed, the director.<br/><br/>Decent movie, but lead by someone more capable, this could have been an amazing movie."
"KrIaXPaTaLa","8","1","1","1 March 2018"," Whats wrong with moviegoers?
","So, I've watched Justice League almost immediately after Thor Ragnarok, I think they were just a couple of weeks apart. I prefer DC to Marvel, but mostly I'm a huge comics fan. <br/><br/>Thor is currently 8.0 on imdb, JL is 6.8. This is absurd, Thor is a far lesser movie than JL. Guardians of the galaxy 2 was also a lot worse. It seems Marvel managed to reach a point were anything they do is good, and DC (because of the Dark Knight series, maybe?) can't do anything wright. I reckon after BvS, I had higher expectations to a JL movie. The 8 reflects a bit that disappointment, has a DC fan I wanted a 10. The run time of just 120 min really threw me off. So, after watching, It actually seemed a good DC movie (even with the director's problems), and well paced. It's not has good has BvS, but it's not bad, at all. I reckon each character could have had a standalone movie first (including Batman - and also, the entire decision of going with a older Batman was also a disappointment to me, might have made sense to a BvS story line, but on JL not really), but this small, easy in the eye, JL, might have been a good contribution to just that, and to a larger, bigger assembly movie in the future.<br/><br/>If you have no affinity to DC, you probably didn't like BvS, and you'll probably not like JL. Thor is just a comedy (and a quick way to kill off unwanted characters for infinity war), so probably anyone will like it (specially on drugs).<br/><br/>But is not DC's fault there are almost no good blockbuster movies anymore for you to see."

","I obviously didn't go see the movie in cinema because I was skeptical, so I waited for Pirated version, and even then I watched it only because there was nothing else to watch.<br/><br/>But this movie was surprisingly good, not just decent but actually good!<br/><br/>Why did I have bad expectations? Well for starters Batman v Superman was really bad, and countless people have videos on that topic.
So what else? The cover, the trailer, the designs and few minor things. All that was a real turnoff.<br/><br/>But this movie did great.<br/><br/>The costume designs where the biggest issue for me. Batman looks stiff and too bulky, and a bit silly. 
The Dark Knight...more like The Grey Knight.<br/><br/>The flash is something new, it bothered me at first but I got used to it.<br/><br/>There's more to be said but no time, ill finish later."
"boe_dye","6","1","1","26 February 2018"," A thorough lack of understanding of the DC Universe.
","At best this movie was strange. It had all the proper elements of a good film, yet studio heads seem to have a serious lack of understanding the psychology of the D.C. Universe.<br/><br/>By nature, the D.C. Universe is significantly darker and more mature than Marvel. As such, they have an opportunity to delve into more cerebral stories than Marvel, and yet they treat this like a kids film. I am thoroughly convinced that Joss Whedon has become the last person anyone would want writing, or directing, or even producing their film as he is little more than a generic story teller.<br/><br/>While Zach Snyder get's a great deal of flack, if left to his own devices he often times captures the spirit of the grittier, darker comics, IE 300 and Watchmen (despite it's flaws). Unfortunately a great deal happened with Snyder during production which left this movie essentially in shambles and broken from the start.<br/><br/>The casting was good, however how they were used was mixed. Ezra Miller's Flash stole more than enough scenes, but Jason Mamoa's Aquaman was a bit too fratboy. Cyborg was interesting, but underdeveloped and Wonder Woman seemed like an extension from the Wonder Woman film. I've liked Affleck as Batman thus far, much to my surprise, but this just seemed meh... Henry Cavill felt entirely wooden and his apparent CGI face was incredibly distracting. Steppenwolf was the most disappointing in that he was little more than Aries redux, and as an antagonist was boring, uninspiring and just another CGI cut scene.<br/><br/>In short, this movie was just strange. It seemed that it had all the elements to make a solid film, but moves it too fast, establishes nothing, goes from scene to scene to scene, and is flat out generic and forgettable.<br/><br/>It's a shame because this could have been absolutely wonderful."

Justice League received mixed reviews. Critics praised the action sequences and solid performances, but criticized the writing, pacing, and CGI. The plot was thin, and the villain underdeveloped. It performed well in the theaters, but not as well as expected. The DC Extended Universe failed to develop its individual characters before expanding its universe. They are producing sub-par films to try and quickly catch up to the MCU, instead of developing quality films. They could easily out pace the MCU by just producing better quality, similar to that of the very successful Wonder Woman."

","""Justice League"" was the film everyone was waiting for, a year's worth of speculation and a year's worth of hype, for what? <br/><br/>Overall the whole production looked rushed, the story was weak, the superhero ensemble fell flat, this is a film that should've been shelved for longer, wait until each of the five characters had their own independent film released to give some semblance of a backstory before releasing this ""Justice League"". <br/><br/>Ben Affleck is about as unconvincing a Batman that you're going to get, he's had a lot of stick about this role and rightfully so, he's no Christian Bale, heck he's not even Adam West, he just plain sucks at being Batman!<br/><br/>This ""Justice League"" looks like something that would've been produced back in the nineties, maybe with Val Kilmer still playing Batman..., the CGI was terrible, reminiscent of the early days, the villain was plain rubbish (couldn't they have come up with a better villain from the wide scope they have to choose from?) the CGI and performance of said villain was woeful, borderline insulting.<br/><br/>This is perfect proof that the comic book genre is feeling the effects of a burnout, there's only so much you can do before you end up overdoing it..., the DC expanded universe is seriously suffering and cannot get anywhere near the standards that their rivals Marvel have set, if I were DC I'd take a few years off, count my blessings, and rethink my strategy because there's got to be a better was of producing films and creating an expanded universe than this. <br/><br/>Granted it's not a bad film as film's go, but with all the hype and all the potential that this film had, the end result is staggeringly disappointing, I expected a lot more than what I was given."
"TheWorldWarrior28","8","1","1","16 January 2018"," Unite the League.... Kinda
","Finally.... Years and years and more years of waiting and we finally got the ultimate heroes on the big screen together. Well almost all of them. I was going to say that Justice League was the Ultimate comic book movie... but as much as I loved the film, I just can't give it the Ultimate status that I thought I would. Its fun, and entertaining. But its TOO light... It feels like a completely separate entry from the rest of the DCEU. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. But its not a good thing either. I know that Zack Snyder had already intended for Justice League to be lighter in tone as opposed to Batman V Superman, but after he left the project, Joss, WB and anyone else in charge of taking over just overdid it with the corny jokes, color pallete, and the editing. Removing the 3 most important and talked about scenes that were featured in the July 2017 trailer was completely unacceptable. Those scenes would have made Steppenwolf feel more developed and more important to the general audiences and for those that don't know about Steppenwolf, Darkseid, or the New Gods. The reshoots are to blame for that. The reshoots were completely unnecessary. You can easily tell which scenes were reshoots because the actors look completely different. It honestly felt like they were pushing this movie more on the Marvel side of comic book movies. And thats not good because I love the DCEU and they were doing their own thing and they should've kept at it. <br/><br/>Justice League aborted the arc that was set up in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice. So don't expect to see too many correlations between the two films. On the positive side, Justice League was action packed just like the other DCEU films. Steppenwolf was great villain in my opinion because I already knew about him and his purpose since I read the comics. The plot was short and simple to understand for those that didn't like how BVS was ""too difficult"" to understand. It's extremely fun seeing Earth's greatest heroes together on the big screen. Thats why I rated JL a 8/10. It was exciting and felt like I was watching the animated series all over again. Of course I wish the movie had turned out the way Zack Snyder intended it to be, but maybe we'll get a ZS cut in the future. One can only hope at this point. Since Justice League is no longer in theaters in most areas, when its available for digital download (rent/buy) you should check it out. Form your own opinion. Watch it looking for fun and not looking for the negatives. Watch it with an open mind and take it for what it is, a Justice League movie."

","Knowing that more metahumans and assorted superpowered creatures will be coming to Earth with a bad attitude, Batman (played by Ben Affleck), recruits other metahumans (Gal Gadot as Wonderwoman, Jason Momoa as Aquaman, Ezra Miller as the Flash, and Ray Fisher as Cyborg) to form a league to combat all the incoming super bad dudes out there. Affleck's problem is that some of the metahumans in his wish list don't want to join, and they all still have to learn how to fight as a unit.<br/><br/>And then comes Steppenwolf, a super bad guy who has been alive way before the invention of toilet paper, always in a pissy mood and wants to control everything he sees. He is in search of three special boxes that will give him more power to accomplish his goals. But the ""Justice League"" is there to do their best to put a wrench in Steppenwolf's hostile takeover machine.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Justice League"" is the scene when Momoa didn't know he was sitting on Gadot's truth lasso, and he just started spewing funny and insulting comments about his League members. The best joke was on Affleck.<br/><br/>Grade B-...not bad for a movie, right? Well, for a $300 million movie (plus the costs of advertising and distribution) it's a failure. For one thing, there were too many cooks in the kitchen. With two directors working on this movie at different times, you just know certain things aren't going to mix well. Then there was the mandate that the movie should be about two hours long. Hmmm...a movie that has to tell the origins of Steppenwolf, plus Aquaman, plus Cyborg, plus The Flash, plus show how Affleck gets all his people together, plus that whole thing with raising Superman from the dead and how he was going to deal with it and how the world and the League will deal with him...all that in two hours? Studio executives...please stop taking cocaine/Vicodin/alcohol when you make decisions about a movie. Two hours were definitely not enough to tell this story well, and it shows.<br/><br/>Then there are the shenanigans, such as Wonder Woman being fast enough to deflect bullets from an automatic weapon, yet where the hell was all that speed when she fought Steppenwolf? Then you have The Flash who is supposed to be extremely fast (some sources say about the speed of light, which is 186,000 miles per second); but he is getting his ass handed to him a few times by the bad guys who have normal speed. The same with Superman (played by Henry Cavill): he is now extremely fast and should be able to kill Steppenwolf's minions by the thousands in a few seconds, but can't. Suspension of disbelief doesn't mean the audience will forgive poor screenwriting and numerous logical flaws in the story.<br/><br/>Problems, problems; but $300 million does buy a lot of eye candy. For those who want to be dazzled and entertained, this movie may do it for you. Just don't expect too much substance, or sense.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"

"badroniaimi-351-922611","7","1","1","9 January 2018"," Nice movie, great special effects, but there are some missing pieces
","I did really like this movie, it is the first movie where you can see the most of DC heroes fighting together against one enemy, but the problem is the power gap between superman and the others (specially batman) without the kryptonite superman is unstoppable (maybe darkside will be the perfect match for him) but let be honnest batman is a strong man , smart , fast ... but still he doesn't have any superpower therefore he won't be helpful in real combats.
On the other hand they underestimate flash, however he is better than batman by long shot.For the others they are just fine on thier own. I believe this is the problem with DC they have superman (wich mean a huge power gap between the team members), on the other hand Marvel has bunch of superheroes who are close to eachother when it comes to power, so they can build a perfect team.
For the poeple who ask to see Marvel heroes (the avengers) fighting against DC ones (The justice league) I think it won't make any since because superman can destroy them all, maybe he will find trouble with the hulk but the others don't hove enough powers to survive against him, except is they use Kryptonite. Also both sides are good and good poeple don't fight eachother (don't remind me of civil war because no one died there and there is no power gap between Marvel's heroes so no one died)."
"carlamgad","8","1","1","5 January 2018"," Justice League, this is history.
","Justice League... The movie that made all the critics and the fans divided... The only way to know who's right, we need to start it from the beginning, not from the first second of the movie, but from the year 2008. In 2008, Marvel decided to create a cinematic universe by introducing Iron Man. After that, all the big studios liked that idea and began to create many franchises, and from this step, Warner Bros. decided to create an Extended Universe for DC. It was a difficult decision to compete with Marvel 'cause you know, the two are both comic book franchises, so they made it different, darker, they made the viewer not only see his favorite characters on the big screen, but also see a meaning behind the story, like we all know that all these story can't be real, so they produced Man of Steel in 2013, and changed the character from a man with many powers that can't be defeated to a symbol of hope. And then they waited 3 years for putting a plan for their universe, and then, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice came to life, with a story of a new character, the Batman. In Batman V Superman, they showed another Batman we was waiting for, another old one full of pain that, they didn't show a lot of his background, only a story of the death of his parents, to show how he feels about the injustice around him, and how this little boy became this violent bat, and how began to create his own justice, so Warner Bros. changed this freak man dressed like a bat with big muscles to a symbol of justice. They also showed a secondary character which was Wonder Woman, and the only thing we know about her in this movie was that there are also female superheroes in this world, and how Batman and Superman couldn't win the fight without her. This movie critics called it a big mess, but I saw an iconic movie. After that Warner Bros. produced some solo movies like Suicide Squad which showed us new characters that decided to change who they are from bad guys to a superheroes, and this movie took place after the death of Superman. Wait, hold on a second, Superman died. Yes, Superman died defeating the evil. But you said he was the symbol of hope. Yes, and that's what happened, there were no hope left from BVS, and that was a big factor in Suicide Squad, the criminals saved the day with no hope but to change what they are. And then came Wonder Woman, the amazonian girl who wanted to know the truth about who realy is she and the truth about the Ares and the truth about the real evil in the world. Wonder Woman took place in our picture as the symbol of Truth.<br/><br/>But what is life without hope?<br/><br/>Justice League. Yes, I think we are ready now to talk about it. Batman knew that someone is coming from far away by a several tries to catch an explorer which was a parademon that we knew in the movie can smell fear. So, he knew he can't fight for justice when he is alone, and began to start his plan which was creating a team, this team wasn't like the Suicide Squad which was a squad of criminals, the Justice League was a team with different people with no common things between them, and movie showed that history is repeating itself, and told us the story of Steppenwolf and the unite of all sides of life as Human, Amazons, Atlantians and also Greenlanterns to defeat him. Then we knew another superheroes, some of them liked the idea of the league, some of them thought hey were better alone, and others thought that they were monsters and their powers was not more than a curse. And the only thing that made them all unite, was that they didn't want to see their people in danger, 'cause inside each one of them there was a hero. But what is life without hope? They asked this question to themselves. And they decided to return Superman, the symbol of hope, it was Batman's idea, not 'cause he thought they can't defeat Steppenwolf without him, but for two other reasons, the first was that he knew that if there was a 1% chance to return him again to life, that based on the justice he have to do it. And the second reasons that to end the rumors that he is the one that killed Superman and to exit this idea from his own mind. And he did it, Superman came back to life with hope, and the team is completed. The Justice League is here to stop Steppenwolf from changing the Earth to a copy of the planet he came from. And by team work and iconic shots by the camera, the justice won the match and saved the day. This is not a story of some heroes with superpowers and dressed like cartoon characters saved the day, it's a story of how hope can unite the Justice League."

That said, his involvement was necessary and the movie wasn't awful. <br/><br/>I agree with the people who say Superman is overpowered in the movie. Wonder Woman should be almost on a par with him when it comes to strength, with better fighting skills, so in theory she should have been capable of taking down the villain herself."
"wwwbsdjrulz","7","1","1","2 January 2018"," We need a JL sequel!!!
","Okay, to start off, the negative reviews on this movie are trash because even though this isn't Avengers, the movie is an overall improvement from the dark, gloomy likes of BvS. Not only that, but this also stands out as a different fresh new take of the team that fans all around the world love and cherish.
The movies was good, the story was okay, even though there were some small places where scenes were not proparly combined. The team recruiting scenario was fine, those scenes with Aquaman and Bruce or Barry and Bruce had a beautiful take on them that was nostalgic in such team up scenarios. The actors were good too. Ben Affleck's Batman has taken a brighter turn into hoping for good and even though many criticised this version, I think it's fair that Bruce looks optimistic since he is inspired by Superman's death. And speaking of the Man of Steel, Cavill did an excellent job (the moustache was not his fault though if you're thinking of an off point to Henry). Superman finally becomes the hopeful, shining sentinel of justice and heroism that fans have adored ever since the first Superman comic. Gal Gadot slayed (man, was she hot) and most importantly, her chemistry with Batman made me feel as if the two had a thing going on. Plus, her character development was brilliant. Cyborg even had a good story arc and so did ""Merman"" (spoilers) and Barry was a comic relief though I did feel his more science geek personality was toned down. The villian was a little bit weaker in character and CGI but was intimidating all the same.
All in all, I loved this movie. Even though I'm a loyal Marvel fan, I started rooting for this movie since I started watching it. This movie has a whole plethora of cool action scenes. I really, really hope they continue with this franchise because, in my opinion, this is a hearty, fun ride."

","'Justice League' is the 5th film in the DC Extended Universe and, after 'Wonder Woman', is their best attempt to compete with Marvel - even going as far as bringing in 'The Avengers' director, Joss Whedon, to write the screenplay. The director, Snyder (who also directed 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman V Superman') is only given a ""story by"" credit. If you haven't seen any of those three films, I suggest you do, as this film starts with Clark/Superman (Cavill) already dead and Batman/Bruce (Affleck) and Wonder Woman/Diana (Godot) pulling together a super-team to fight off some impending doom.<br/><br/>There's the obligatory hour of introductions to each of the five main characters: Arthur/Aquaman (Momoa), Victor/Cyborg (Fisher), Barry/Flash (Miller, the best new character) - plus more screen time for Lois Lane (Adams), Martha Kent (Lane), Commissioner Gordon (Simmons) and Alfred (Irons), who are all kind of wasted. The plot is that they have to fight off an alien bent on destroying Earth, with his army of zombie-grasshoppers - directly ripped off from 'Star Wars: Attack of the Clones'. It's an odd choice, since this should technically be aimed at kids, but I'm not sure if I'd let anyone younger than 10 watch this...<br/><br/>But that's part of the problem with the DCEU so far - it's still trying to be dark and unforgiving, attempting to reach Nolan's Batman trilogy, but not hitting any of the marks. Something's just missing that doesn't hold it all together as well as a Marvel film. And, odd as it may sound, there's probably too much CGI here. Not a spoiler: obviously Superman comes back and helps save the day, but it begs the question - isn't everyone a bit suspicious that Clark Kent is now somehow walking around? There's some decent quips and a few funny moments, mostly thanks to Flash and some OK battle scenes. Plenty of enjoyable moments, but not quite a fully-formed faction film."

","There is no way, I loved Justice League, even with all the problems of the film it was very difficult I did not like it since it is a childhood dream to see a movie with all these heroes together, it is not the best film of this DC Universe, Wonder Woman is a better movie, has fewer problems and has a better script, Justice League had a lot of fun for being a fan, I liked the cast, Ben Affleck as Batman leaves a little to be desired if you buy in Batman vs. Superman, it's a very different character , Gal Gadot continues to shut up haters, she's great in this movie, she's charismatic, fun and pretty much all the best scenes she's involved in, Ezra Miller is pretty much like Flash, but I think her mood has gone overboard a few times, but she is the comic relief of the movie and works on a lot of the film, Jason Momoa she does Aquaman well, but the group is the weakest, but even so, she had some nice scenes with him and I quite expect the Aquman solo movie in 2018, Ray Fisher was a big surprise, he was better than I expected, the arc is very dramatic and the darkest of the film, but his CGI has problems, but he commands very well, and Henry Cavill is impossible to speak but I still have a lot to get close to the legend Christopher Reeve, but I really like his participation, the villain of the film Steppenwolf unfortunately is a villain, forgettable, is a generic villain and with a problematic CGI, I liked the participation of Queen Hippolyta and Mera even though it was very small, Amy Adams has a legal and important participation in the film too, the script is very problematic unfortunately, and this is due to the reshoots that the film was due to the tragedy that happened to Zack Snyder's daughter. and also by the cuts that Warner made with the film and thus hurting too much, I'm sure that if the film did not have as much cut would have fared better in the world reviews, the mood of the film in general I found unnecessary in the film, the film it does not have to be dark, but you do not have to want to have unnecessary jokes, the movie should have the same Wonder Woman tone, jokes just in the right moment, and be dramatic when necessary, but I'm keen to continue this universe, Justice League was a film that I found satisfactory, but it is undeniable that the film could have been much better.

","First of all, it is important to note that it is helpful (although not necessary) to see 'Batman vs. Superman' prior to seeing this film. This is because 'Justice League' follows that movie chronologically, so therefore the first few minutes of the movie will make more sense. The events from 'Batman vs. Superman' are an underlying story line of 'Justice League', but you will be able to catch on quickly without having seen 'Batman vs. Superman'. <br/><br/>With that said, overall, the film is surprisingly good. To be honest, I am more of a Marvels fan but after seeing 'Wonder Woman' and enjoying that film; I wanted to see this film. Therefore, my deciding factor behind seeing this film was my enjoyment of 'Wonder Woman' and once again, Gal Gadot shines as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince. However, the surprise standout of the film Ezra Miller as The Flash/Barry Allen. Miller and his character were used as the comedic relief of the movie, and it definitely worked. His comedic timing and witty lines were the highlights of the movie. Besides Miller's standout performance, the rest of the cast all seemed to gel together well making it believable that the Justice League will come together to save the world. <br/><br/>The last thing worth mentioning is the main theme of the movie - to never give up hope, even in the darkest of times. This theme not only came across in the dialogue of the film, but in the entire cast's portrayal of their characters. They made it believable that if we have hope, everything will be okay in the end."

A much livelier movie than Man of Steel or Batman v. Superman, and the character's personalities and personas are more like that of what we knew of growing up. This movie's villain felt purely a stand in so that the movie would have a villain for the heroes to play around as they developed their friendship. Parts of the movie seemed to be missing, like the beginning sequence of Wonder Woman v. bank robbers/terrorists?.<br/><br/>The end sequence was the most enjoyable, though it lacked a sense of true danger.

I will admit the tonal change in this movie does come off as abrupt.<br/><br/>That being said, my only real complaint at this point is the fact that Superman did not compete with The Flash on foot. I remember finding that comic book in an antique shop when I was a kid, and I'll never forget the cover depicting The Flash racing against Superman.<br/><br/>I had so much fun with this movie, and I hope others can enjoy it for what it is.

I still have that disappointment though. The movie does not meet my expectations as a fan. It does not match the DC's atmosphere that we all know. Nevertheless, it was good to see your favorite superheros on the big screen. I tried to enjoyed that, but again it was inadequate for my opinion."

","The film is a disastrous, yet terrible and undoubtedly bad film that will make you hate the film's guts. The film's characters are not here for anyone's entertainment, they are as bad developed as one can develop. Ben Affleck should quit and never come back to being Batman because he is one of the worst characters you may see in this movie. Spoilers!, Superman comes back to life which is obvious from what you see from the trailers and it is just making you hate and despise the film more, more and more. I recommend watching the marvel films instead of this boring, repetitive and dull film which is trying to make you like it.<br/><br/>Many superhero films have been created and they were well deserved to be the best films you will ever see but this should have been cancelled but the movie earned quite a lot of money due to its production.<br/><br/>Go watch the marvel movies instead of this, this despicable film."

","In short this is the worst superhero film to ever hit the big screen, there is next to no storyline whatsoever and the entire film is held together by a shoe string.
Batman is by far the worst disappointment for me but I'm sure everyone reading this will have there own opinion on which character is the worst. The funny thing is that I actually don't mind Ben Affleck playing the bat. It's how they present the character that is most disappointing. Where is the batman who defeated the likes of the joker and bane. That batman was a force to be reckoned with, a figure who commanded both fear and respect. And where has the tumbler gone? That was a masterpiece of a batmobile. Batman used to have clever gadgets and could disappear in a moment's notice. Any idiot can be given more guns but the bat was always more than that. 
The rest of the characters, apart from the flash and superman , I had never even heard of. There was no emotional investment in any of the characters. I didn't find myself rooting for any character which was ashame. What this film was is basically Avengers Assemble but with different characters and no storyline.
As a short filmmaker myself I can tell you that it takes nearly as much effort to make a bad film as it does to make a good one. But I honestly thought they would have learnt there lesson after batman vs superman which was equally disappointing. 
It quite rare when I review a film that I can't find something that is positive about it even when it was a horrific disappointment. But I can honestly say that I cannot find a single element of this film with I was even remotely satisfied with. 
The characters looked animated most of the way through and possessed abilitys not remotely believable. Not looking at anyone In particular (wonder woman). This film was way too cgi heavy. I really wanted to believe that this would finally be the DC powerhouse smash hit that would level the playing field between DC and marvel but the truth is that marvel are wiping the floor with DC and if DC don't turn things around pronto their fan base is going to start shrinking. No matter what the critics say the toughest critics will always be the fans.
This film scores 1/5 for me and that is because it lacks in all areas
Weak plot
Weak characters (including the villain)
Very weak character development.
DC need to wake up and smell the coffee but I have a feeling that they are going too lose a lot more money before they realise that they have made a mistake. Snyder is not the right man for the job on this occasion I would offer the franchise to Christopher Nolan."

","I went in really wanting to like Justice League. I thought Wonder Woman was great, Man of Steel was good, and BVS was better than most people thought. The less said about Suicide Squad the better. Unfortunately, there's just too much going on, too many characters hastily introduced, and no stakes or serious villain for these characters to contend with. I think DC should have waited a few more years on this one. We needed individual films for these heroes so this thing wouldn't feel so jam-packed. That said, there's some good action and Gal Gadot is a star."
"beekaycarter","6","1","1","28 November 2017"," You Can't Save The World Alone. Couldn't Superman?
","Justice League got it wrong in their story, costume design, visual effects and character establishments. Throughout this entire film, not once, not one time at all, did I ever feel as if there was anything at all, at stake. Like, nothing. Sure, with superhero movies, you know the heroes will win, but how is the question. With Justice League, it was easy to answer that ""how"", 5 minutes in; They'll just, beat him (Steppenwolf).<br/><br/>Think about it, nobody, not a single civilian lost their life in this movie (And the reason is so self inflicted, but it'll take too long to explain, and this is getting too long as it is). Every fight was so isolated, with a group of people (like 5 - 6) in the middle of all the chaos at points.<br/><br/>The plan of how to stop Steppenwolf/the Mother Box's is revealed long before the finale battle, so, the worry and anticipation of ""How are they going to stop Steppenwolf"" is thrown out the window... And on top of that, the plan isn't all that smart or intelligent... And on top of that, what's the point of that plan, when you have Superman now, clearly???<br/><br/>At no point did any of the League members, suit up, at no point at all. Costume design is a MAJOR factor, and the only time Justice League; yes Justice League, got it right, was in Man of Steel... 4 years ago.<br/><br/>Then you have a Mother Box that is so dangerous and powerful, yet the best place to hide and conceal it is a ditch 1 metre/3 feet deep???<br/><br/>6/10. Why 6 and not less? The Superman vs The Justice League fight (that whole sequence including the dialog in fact) as well as the privilege of having witnessed The Justice League's first ever outing on the silver screen."
"shobanchittuprolu","5","1","1","28 November 2017"," Justice League is one of the most disappointing super-hero film and it could have been worse if not for Gal Gadot's tremendous performance and Ezra Miller's comic relief.
","Justice League (2017): I never expected DC would have such downfall whereas Marvel is building an unanimous string base allover the world.I may not be a fan of any super-hero films but I used to love Justice League series in my childhood.Even the animated films of DC used to provide enough fun but what happened now?While Man of Steel is below average,I thought BvS is pretty decent compared to its negative reception,Suicide Squad wasted its amazing potential and Wonder Woman is the only film which put DC on a success track.But,I was proved wrong that DC have no idea of doing justice to Justice League..The only thing DC got right till now is casting of Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Plot: The Superman (Henry Cavill) has perished, and the world is in peril. Still haunted by visions of an apocalyptic future, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) continues to investigate Earth's metahumans, and along with Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) recruits a speedster named Barry Allen a.k.a. The Flash (Ezra Miller), a water-powered Arthur Curry a.k.a. Aquaman (Jason Momoa), and cybernetically enhanced Victor Stone a.k.a. Cyborg (Ray Fisher) to form a ragtag team. Unfortunately, Bruce's visions start to become fully realized with the arrival of Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds) and his Parademons - an alien force hunting three hidden devices known as Mother Boxes in hopes or reshaping the world. Knowing that their help is needed, Earth's hidden champions come out of the shadows to form an uneasy alliance and usher in a new age of heroes.<br/><br/>My Review: Five films into the DCEU, the DC brains trust should have their s*it together by now. They should have an understanding of why their films are or aren't working as well as they could, i.e. they should have some idea as to why Wonder Woman worked but Man Of Steel, BvS:DoJ and Suicide Squad didn't.<br/><br/>While previous DC films tried to be too serious,they tried to change into Marvel's way of generating comedy among characters.It rarely worked in Suicide Squad whereas Wonder Woman has good fun moments.But Justice League tries to look too cool which backfired very badly.Miller gets the bulk of the best lines although Momoa and Affleck trade a few zingers. These comedy moments are the only part which makes us bear this mess.<br/><br/>The major drawback is in the storytelling and structuring. The efforts of introducing new characters, existing characters' motivations, and the intricacies of plot (with its triple MacGuffin) is almost too much for the first half of the film. The film struggles to get any real momentum going as Batman and Wonder Woman try to put their team together, while slotting in some action set pieces, and detailing who and what the Big Bad is (who himself is one of the worst villains I had ever seen in a super-hero film).Aside from a few jokes – which unfortunately don't always land where they're supposed to – and a handful of enticing action sequences – especially the ones surrounding Flash and Wonder Woman – the film, as a whole, feels simplistic in structure and lazy in execution, with the story lacking substance, ingenuity and enough heart to leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>What works best in Justice League is the characterisations. These are popular superheroes for a reason, and they are well realised on the screen. Casting has never been a problem in the DCEU and again they nail it. Gadot was born to be Wonder Woman.She is undeniably the true star of the show.The film's smartest move is to recognise that Gadot is the beating heart of this enterprise. And given that this enterprise rests on a fairly straightforward idea, that a dark world needs hope above all else, you can't do much better than giving people the luminescent Israeli with the wide smile and twinkley eye.Miller – the film's main source for comic relief – and Momoa as the raggedy Aquaman, delivering engaging performances leaving Fisher's Cyborg as the least interesting of the lot.Affleck and Cavill still remains insipid.<br/><br/>So,Justice League is one of the most disappointing super-hero film of all time and it could have been worse if not for Gal Gadot's tremendous performance and Ezra Miller's comic relief.<br/><br/>My rating 5.25/10"
"nogodnomasters","8","1","1","26 November 2017"," Sorry Cuz, I didn't bring a sword.
","Plot spoilers of a predictable plot.<br/><br/>The film picks off after the last one left off...the one where Superman died and not the Suicide Squad thing. It seems when Superman died, this opened things up for aliens to come take over the Earth such as Steppenwolf, who was here before and was defeated aka LOTR style as races united to fight a common evil. Each was given a box to guard because a ring was already done. The boxes are part of a device that was designed to reform the Earth, almost like the Genesis Project in Star Trek that brought Spock. In fact I knew they would bring back Superman the moment they killed him as did most of us. Flash (Ezra Miller) was a refreshing character bringing some humor to the film reminding me of Spiderman in that other superhero series. I think the film would have been better if the Superman casket had been empty.<br/><br/>I have my standard criticisms: the fight scenes were too long and the plot was too predictable. Sound track and effects were good. What happened to the Clooney Batman again? I have a ""Homer Simpson"" view of this League. If you have Superman, why do you need the rest? I think the series would have been better with Superman dead. Especially with Henry Cavill being the most boring Superman to date. Call me a male pig, but I liked Wonder Woman with cleavage. Did I say I liked Flash? I thought the new Thor film was better written and performed."
"musardhianto","6","1","1","17 November 2017"," Its not that Bad, but not that good either
","Its not a bad superhero movie, but less from my expectation. Cuz we all agree that WW's success put high standart for DCEU upcoming movies. First note to know, we know that Zack make this movie while having big tragedy, and in the injury time, Joss stepped in to finish what must be done. not change anything from Zack's. From that note, a mess in putting everything together and last time editing will be ""pretty"" tolerated.<br/><br/>First point is the tone, i liked BvS and MoS tone so much, cz it has different view for superhero movie. pretty realism and more characteristic. But i understand, they want better viewer who want superhero movie more ""light"", which make WW great success. And i liked it. But this is too light. Thank god it's not at Thor Ragnarok level. And some CGI are too obvious. Especially for background CGI. So less Zack's way.<br/><br/>In the Character point of view, Wonder Woman still stand out the most, followed by Flash and Cyborg (which i recommend WB & DC to have Cyborg own movie to dig his character more. Cuz his set up and problem is potentially good). Aquaman didn't stand out much, just one interaction with Mera, thats understandable cuz they'll develop in their own movie. The let down for me is Batman and Steppenwolf. Batman is pretty good and badass, but i still prefer his performance in BvS which is really dark and grounded. In JL, he smile a lot, came in bright daylight a lot. Im not complaining Steppenwolf un-menacing character (cz i don't read the comic version of him), but i disappointed about Steppenwolf's story about being simple villain, which is make the story pretty easy and blend. But the interaction between superheroes is great. The set up for making Flash as more newbie, Cyborg's personality, and the connection with previous movie set ups are great.<br/><br/>But, so far, this movie is pretty good experience to watch. cant wait the director's cut version.<br/><br/>PS: End credit scene is one of the best thing that needed in this movie, so sit tight till the end."

","Seen Justice League at a fab screening today and was so worried about it being a pure comic book movie fan and a fan of these characters. I'm not a crazy Marvel or DC fan I have always been a fan of both universes in film and comics. But since Man of Steel had such a bad reaction or should I say mixed reaction I've felt it being hard to win people over with this new version of DC movies. Man of Steel ended being in my top 10 superhero movies of all time and this is coming from a person who isn't a fan of Superman. But not everyone agrees with the movie so then comes Batman v Superman which I thought was subpar not a great movie but still has parts I can appreciate and suicide squad which I loved upon first viewing but then started to see its flaws after a second time and understand why people hate it. But going into Justice League I was kind of scared because Wonder Woman was so great I didn't want them to backtrack and I have to say they did not. This movie is great sure it has plot problems and a villain who is totally forgettable and says mother a lot you'll see what I mean when you see the movie since he is referencing something but this movie has such a great vibe. It's about hope and these new age of hero's and I think it took the right step for the DC characters since a lot of the complaints was that it was too dark. Without giving to much away with plot basically steppenwolf comes after 3 things on earth and Batman and Wonder Woman have to recruit the team in order to stop him. And one of the best parts of this movie is the characters and the way they interact with each other. Flash and Wonder Woman where the stand outs, Batman was great as always, cyborg was spot on and aquaman brought all The comedy. Overall I'm happy to say the movie was great. If I was to rank it in favorite DCEU movies so far it would be. 1. Man of Steel 2. Wonder Woman 3. Justice League Oh yeah Danny Elfmans score is great when you hear the Batman and the Superman theme the audience will probably clap loud. Pros: Characters, script, score. Cons: villain, a few plot holes, needed to be longer<br/><br/>Also the 2 post credit scenes are awesome the first one is fun the second one reminded me of the iron man post credit scene but very Anti you'll see what I mean lol don't wanna spoil it but overall I had a smile on my face the entire time after I left the theater. <br/><br/>I wish I can explain more in detail but there are so many spoilers in this movie most of the trailer didn't even show everything something's was misdirection and some things aren't even in the movie that was in the trailer. And some characters don't get much screen time. But like I said it's a great movie. I'm hoping it gets a rating that it deserves because sometimes I think people are overly critical about these movies. If I was to compare it to a marvel movie I would compare it to Captain America civil war or the first Guardians but with the villain from Thor the dark world"
"thomasrkent","2","7","18","26 November 2017"," Don't insult me by saying it's for the fans.
","I'm a DC fan and I hate this movie, I'm all for superhero films having fan service and Easter eggs but when that takes precedent over the story then I take issue. This movie doesn't have characters it has sock puppets with personalities written on them. Flash is the funny one, Cyborg is the moody one, Aquaman....actually I don't even know what he was meant to be. Aquaman is just sort of there. Batman in this movie is not Batman. They have him stand on some gargoyles every now and then to remind you he's supposed to be Batman but his actions and personality simply don't match. Batman V Superman was terrible but at least Batman felt like Batman even if he did stupid things he at least did them like Batman would, he also feels useless in every fight he's in which was foreseen in BvS where he just grapple hooked around Doomsday while Wonder Woman and Superman did everything, pretty much how it goes here. Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman are first properly introduced here and they are all terrible. Cyborg is slightly better because they at least try to give him some development even if it is paper thin and amounts to nothing. The Flash is just a series of awful jokes and they try to give him a subplot with his father that we don't care about cause it's literally two scenes that get resolved by the end. Aquaman is nothing that's the best way I can put it. He says a few dumb lines which I guess are meant to be funny and he hits things with his pitchfork, if you want anything deeper than that then sorry but no luck. At least I can safely say I'll be skipping his movie especially if the underwater effects are as bad as they are here. Wonder Woman is almost good but really if you didn't see her solo movie than you won't understand anything she talks about and you ultimately won't care. The villain isn't worth discussing, he has a pretty funny scene where him and the amazonians are fighting for the plot device and it looks like they're playing rugby or something, It was meant to be serious but it just made me laugh. He has no personality, the cgi for him looks terrible (as does the rest of the effects) and his goal is just ""i wanna destroy the world cause reasons' I would be more angry but the film is so bad that this is the least of their worries. The writing is ridiculously bad with exposition being used whenever they can't be bothered to tell the story in a smart way. Wonder Woman literally tells us the villains entire backstory in a scene that is purely dedicated to exposition and a cheeky green lantern Easter egg that is meaningless because this universe is dead. There is only 1 line of dialogue I actually liked where Batman convinces Flash to save someone, that was the only time anyone in this movie felt heroic. Also the movie is just ugly to look at, the entire final sequence is red I'm not kidding if you look at the trailer you'll see it the whole scene is just red not to mention the final fight is so forgettable it was over before I knew it. It would of just passed as the prologue fight you see in other superhero films. Overall this movie is awful in every aspect of where a film should be good, people are defending it cause they enjoy seeing certain characters hit each other which to me shows how little audiences care about actual filmmaking. I give it a 2 just because I didn't walk out and it was mercifully shorter than these films normally are. If you liked this movie I'm happy for you but It also makes me sad to know you'll accept a movie this flawed."

It's all you could ask for in a superhero movie.<br/><br/>Like always, Ben Affleck's take on The Caped Crusader left me speechless. His Bruce Wayne is Charismatic, smart and brave. At first, I was a bit skeptical about the costumes and castings, but in the end, Justice League delivered some of the most comic accurate portrayals in DC's history. <br/><br/>The build-up to the main conflict was great. It was easy to follow and it wasn't too slow. As I was watching the movie, it felt like only 15 minutes had passed! I was sucked in to my the story. There was no parts of the movie that was pointless or unnecessary. Everything works. What I would like to improve is the dialogue between the members. It felt flat and uninteresting. Flash and Batman is the only characters that pops to me. Wonder Woman felt so different in Justice League. she was not the symbol of hope like she was in Wonder Woman, but it was a very minor problem.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very great film and I can't wait to see what DC does with Aquaman."
"mitchelgard","7","6","15","16 November 2017"," Could have been so much better!
","Tonight in I went into the movies to watch the movie I had been wanting to see come to life since I was a child. I wore my Justice League shirt which I designed myself and was so excited to see how it would turn out. So I went in with high hopes thinking it would do so much better than Batman Vs Superman. To be honest I already thought BVS was a great movie anyway. However I left the cinema very disappointed. It was too funny and had moved away from the whole serious side that DC had pretty much built its foundations around. So I'm sorry but to suddenly change like that and for a massive movie too. It just didn't make any sense to me. It had a lot of good things about it. The action scenes were amazing! Aquaman by far steals the show and I cannot wait to see his solo film. However the one character who think would be the biggest bad-ass in the film is actually the such a wimp. Yeah I get that Batman doesn't have superpowers but come on! You took down Superman and yet now you are scared of a couple para-demons like come on. You have gadgets you could use. <br/><br/>This is what angers me the most is when the most bad-ass character in the whole DC universe ends of being the biggest baby in a movie where he should be kicking everyone's ass. My honest opinion I reckon the whole reason why Batman was like this is because he was too dark in Batman Vs Superman, but what did you people expect he is the crown prince of darkness. That is what pisses me off, when non-comic book fans complain about movies that they don't understand and then directors have to completely change movies to suit everyone. It's just not fair to the fans who have loved the comic books and want to see what happens in the comic book come to life on the big screen. Sadly it didn't happen in Justice League. As a huge fan of the comic books this movie just didn't do it for me. Will watch it again probably but I will wait for the extended version to be released and watch that. Honestly if you aren't a comic book fan you'll probably love it. <br/><br/>In conclusion overall it was a great action movie. However it could have been done so much better if they stuck to how Justice League: War was done. Yes I am referring to the animated movie. If they had of done that but in a live action movie well then it would have been awesome."

","Now with Justice League uniting the dark Avengers, Warner Bros. attempts to unite the gods of man, the Amazons, the Atlanteans, the cybernetic world, electric currents (?) and the overseer of those gods, resulting in a joyless action sequence display.<br/><br/>First off, the new team members sway too far from their source material: The Flash's superpower is supposed to be superspeed alone, no electrical currents included as depicted here. Aquaman never once talks to fish, his signature superpower, his only attention seekers going straight to his pecs. The method of bringing Superman back to life (not spoiling anything by the way) makes no sense. Plus, Batman's technology lacks the creativity of his previous versions.<br/><br/>Although, the introductions are sure-fire crowd pleasers, especially Wonder Woman's opening fight to remove a bomb from a public building. The Flash gets a neat intro too as he doodles on an unsuspecting rude guy's face in a millisecond, and right before meeting his father in prison. Like the Flash, Cyborg's backstory also starts off empathetic as his father Cyrus cares little about his son's now monstrous state. Then once Superman comes back, he forgets his identity, leading to a heated entertaining battle against the newly united fivesome.<br/><br/>Yet in the end, the memory of the experience lasts much shorter than Wonder Woman did. The midway directing replacement of Joss Whedon shows as rock music blares at the most inappropriate moments, similarly, Zack Snyder's initiation shows with the dreadful CGI that equals early 2000's graphics.<br/><br/>The screen writing most hurts the cinematic universe as the subplots jump everywhere with no surprises aside from the appalling Captain Obvious dialogue. Superman never properly meets the men in the new league, one Hera might bristle over due to how Wonder Woman's status as the sole female voice is overlooked.<br/><br/>In fact, what happened to the whole family concept? I mean, Batman and Superman both have parent issues, Wonder Woman has mommy issues, Flash and Cyborg both have daddy issues, so what about Aquaman's parental issues? His lack of attention consequently makes the walking fish man's story arc the most incomplete, since we don't see him again until a half hour after his introduction. To make the nitpicks more aggravating: Exposition repeats itself three times each until the final moments literally spoon-feed the message as if everything contained some deeper meaning. Honestly, the scriptwriting nitpick list tops the mass of Jupiter.<br/><br/>I now wish this movie was entirely animated, mainly to cover up the dreadful acting. The cast clearly reads off cue cards half the time, the other half of the time they pause too often, supposedly struggling to remember their lines. Henry Cavill in particular continues his reputation as a horrible, terrible performer... why bring him back? Why? They even needed to CGI his moustache away—just further evidence that Superman should STAY dead.<br/><br/>Justice League in general seems to worship the flesh more so than the spirit, as every actor, yes, EVERY ACTOR, looks gorgeous, even after a tread through Hades in the climax. After his resurrection, Superman's hair, skin, and six-pack still look flawless without a sign of decomposition. The same especially goes to the staging of Gal Gadot: she wears leather tight pants, her booty framed to fill up the screen. Heck, her skirt barely even covers her butt cheeks! Meanwhile, the Flash, the skinny Jewish boy, covers his entire body under a high-tech suit, and Cyborg must survive off machinery to replace his permanently damaged African American body, as if race and religion weren't body- shamed enough.<br/><br/>I'm now mortified to call these guys ""superheroes,"" as they do nothing besides thwart whomever blocks their path to pride. Bruce tries to tell Diana about how she brings out people's better selves, but with the physical violence she resorts to, she does the complete opposite. They're all teaching girls to publicly sexualize themselves, which could cause men to rape them. They're all teaching boys to overwork their muscles, which could cause them to fall into heart failure by steroids or exhaustion. I have no recollection of hearing the word ""hero"" in this heap; so now comics avoid rescuing a cat from on top of a tree to celebrate an ideal fantasy where you can feel more powerful than God himself. At the same time, Justice League wants you to lower your submission to worship DC's nonexistent gods, who stand for anything but truth, justice, and the American way."
"jojodyoking","10","5","12","19 November 2017"," very good movie
","I love this movie. It's excellent movie from my point of view. It's like improvement from the last Zack Snyder's movie aka superman vs batman. The chemistry between all the characters is good. There are a lot of action in it. There also a lot of funny dialog between characters. I am waiting for next justice league movies."
"kevinish","10","5","12","19 November 2017"," Fast paced, fun, and funny
","An excellent follow up to Wonder Woman, this intelligent roller-coaster is a must see. The story never drags, even with the introduction of three new characters. One of the better things about JL is that they don't try to ape The Avengers ""Friends with Super Powers"" frat boy theme; the funny moments are part of the story, not the main function of the movie. Justice League focuses on kick ass good guys stopping the bad guys, rather than Marvel's ""dance party inconvenienced by some bad guys"" schtick. Gal Gadot and cast do a good job of building their iconic heroes into likable, identifiable characters that still manage to inspire; which we could all use a bit of these days."
"cruise01","10","5","12","19 November 2017"," Justice League is a fun ride. And an awesome start for the DC universe. Cant wait for more.
","The long awaited Justice League is finally here after a long production of reshoots, and after the negative critical reaction with most of the DC movies except for Wonder Woman. DC has been struggling with the critic's reviews unlike the friendly Marvel movies. I will say and admit I enjoyed every DC film to date from Man of Steel, BvS, Suicide Squad, and Wonder Woman. They are just pure entertainment. The characters are dark, the action is visually explosive, and it does feel like a perfect tone that can match up to a comic book style with the characters. Justice League is pure fun, action packed throughout, and it also has some quirky fun humor which is a little lighter in tone if you compared it to BvS that was a bit dark and serious.<br/><br/>Justice League is no Avengers and most of the Marvel movies which they may be stronger when it comes to their storytelling. Justice does everything that you can expect for a DC movie. Lots of action, visual effects, cool fun characters teaming up, and also a cliché villain like Steppenwolf. If you expect some high level-hitting story, you may miss out in this movie.<br/><br/>For a short run time of 2 hours, the shortest DC movie. It does run at a fast pace with Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) trying to assemble a team of heroes like Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Flash (Ezra Miller), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot). After the death of Superman (Henry Cavill), Bruce will need help with this team to battle against Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds) who is planning on finding three mother boxes on Earth to annihilate for complete power. <br/><br/>At this fast pace, the film does briefly run through any character development with these new additions. There is plenty of fun to be had with these characters. Flash and Aquaman were fun and added a great mix up with the team. Cyborg does feel a little underwritten character in the movie. Only wish there was more to his character. Steppenwolf is the cliché villain that shows up out of nowhere and ready to destroy the planet. But when he does show up, the chase scene with the Amazonians trying to escape with the box with him hunting them down was intense. And this type of movie, you do not need a highly developed villain. <br/><br/>Justice League does have a bigger, loud, and visually packed action to keep you on the edge of your seats. And it is why we go to the theatres in the first place. There are also some fun easter eggs thrown in there. Danny Elfman music score was actually good as well. I was disappointed that they replaced Junkie XL with him when Joss Whedon came on board for reshoots and editing. The movies music score does have that feel like a late 1980s superhero movie with some hint of original theme songs which was cool. But it was not entirely distracting when modernizing the themes. <br/><br/>Overall, Justice League is awesome. Lots of visually packed action. A great fun cast ensemble and characters that worked great as the team up. And cant wait to see more. The plot is more linear and straightforward compared to the choppy BvS. It is pure fun.<br/><br/>I rate the film 5 out of 5 stars. I definitely recommend the film to see on the big screen."
"kathecano-29739","10","5","12","18 November 2017"," DO NOT listen to the critics, It is AWESOME!
","I've just watched this movie and the whole audience was laughing and enjoying it so much!! I LOVED THIS MOVIE...too bad WB cut off minutes of it, it deserve more than 110 min, but I think it was AWESOME... I love each character, the only bad thing would be Steppenwolf...He needed to be a great villain but He was not.. anyway, I give it a 10 because I loved them all! Actually it's the first time I really like Ben Affleck as Bat, so I really enjoyed it."
"shrekthepizza","10","5","12","18 November 2017"," Best Superhero Movie Ever Made
","Justice League is the best, most intense, most incredible superhero movie ever made. If you are a DC fan you NEED to see this film. The action is insane. The music is incredible, blending the best of the DC themes together into an endless nostalgia trip. The characters are perfectly cast. I was skeptical about Ezra Miller as Flash, but I was wrong, he's great. Justice League maintains the heavy intensity of Zack Snyder movies with a bit of humor from Joss Whedon, but Justice League is still very much a Zack Snyder film so it maintains the impact and weight from Batman v Superman. Go see it."
"srawrats","9","5","12","17 November 2017"," Way better than I thought it would be, I loved it!
","This was a fun movie and easily one of the best DC movies in a long time, I actually look forward to seeing it again. The entire movie had a very good pace and wasn't too long, the humor was great and it worked well while maintaining a serious tone overall. The Villain was ehh, but it was the interaction between the heroes that made the movie, didn't really matter who the villain was. <br/><br/>For me the big surprise was the Flash, Ezra Miller was just perfect, he really nailed it. I originally did not like the casting but now I really look forward to the Flash movie (hopefully without that awful costume). Superman was very strong and had some great lines, Cavill delivered! I hope we get a Superman movie with a good script, Man of steel was not great. I also liked Wonder Woman way better in this than the standalone version, Gadot plays a perfect Wonder Woman. Momoa played Aquaman just how they wanted, and it worked well, I just prefer the old school version but nobody else would. I ended up liking Cyborg better than I thought I would, and he was important to the movie. Batman was OK but I'm still not a fan of Affleck as Batman, or Amy Adams as Lois Lane. Future looks very bright for DC, and I think most DC fans will love this movie."
"westiekid","10","5","12","17 November 2017"," An exciting future
","This movie is family friendly, funny, enjoyable and made me feel relaxed and warm. DC needs to carry on this path to bring both the visuals and the comedy. <br/><br/>The three League members who stole the show for me: <br/><br/>Ben Affleck was born to play Bruce Wayne and Batman. He and Michael Keaton are the only ones who played both excellent Bruce Waynes and Batmans. I could never see Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne he just never had the look. Ben Affleck has the full package, the looks, the personality, the mannerisms. This guy is my Batman. No one could ever replace him in my eyes. He's everything I wanted in Batman and Bruce Wayne. I love this new funny batman. I love his interactions with Commission Gordon and his right hand man Alfred.<br/><br/>Henry Cavill is another guy who has the look that feels straight out of the comics. I loved this new Superman. I love the scene where he came back to life. It had me at the edge of my seat because his acting was explosive. The way he took on the League sent chills down my spine. He is a brilliant Superman. I enjoy his moments with his mother and girlfriend Lois Lane. Clark Kent has a beautiful personality and it deserves to be explored.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot was mesmerizing in this movie. She is so beautiful as Wonder Woman. I loved how, after decades, Diana was still heartbroken over losing Steve Trevor. I really felt her grieve. Gal Gadot really brings this warmth to Diana Prince and Wonder Woman. I loved the Diana and Bruce scenes. The chemistry between Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck is electric. I really hope DCEU explores more of this relationship in the future. It would be a missed opportunity if they didn't. There already is a big fandom called WonderBats that would love this. <br/><br/>So they you have it, my favorites were the Trinity. For those who aren't familiar, the Trinity is a comic book series involving Batman, Superman and Wonderwoman. <br/><br/>My only complaints for this movie were this one family who the movie focused on. I really did not like this at all. <br/><br/>I loved Jesse Eisennberg exciting return as Lex Luthor. This sets up for future movies involving him and Joe Manganiello's Deathstroke hinting at an injustice league. Already excited for this. I can't wait to see them go up against the Justice League. I'm also excited for Green lantern to join Justice League and i'm hoping it's Hal Jordan. <br/><br/>DCEU have opened up many doors and story lines that can be explored and am already looking forward for this."
"michaelarieljuano","8","5","12","15 November 2017"," A Great Movie For Justice League Fan
","I Have seen it last night, it is amazing movie for DC fan and OK movie for average moviegoers, this movies sure has some problem with story telling and pacing, but this movie is much better than suicide squad and BvS.<br/><br/>I love some Marvel movies for the joke and light-hearted moments, but one thing marvel cant touch DC is the action scene. Sure avengers and civil war has a great fight choreography in it, but it is lacking the grandeur of power display from DC movies, when watching this movie, the league, especially superman and wonder woman truly feels like a god among human which I never felt in any marvel movies.<br/><br/>Most people have problem with CGI and weak villain, I think the CGI is passable and the villain Stephenwolf serves its purpose to unite the Justice League, we doesn't need go to deep with stephenwolf since he is just henchman for darkseid<br/><br/>I gave it an 8/10.<br/><br/>Great movie with a few bump here and there, but overall I feel satisfied.﻿<br/><br/>Will watch it again this week"
"iamstephenbrown","1","4","9","5 June 2018"," Pathetic, Lazy, Confusing
","There will always be 2 types of people in this world: Marvel Fans & People who don't understand what superhero movies are supposed to be. This movie is not worth anybody's time or money. It was rushed and the story made absolutely no sense at all. The hype was so much because the director knew it sucked and needed all the advertising he could get to make the money back atleast. HORRIBLE MOVIE PEOPLE, Don't waste your time. And I still see people giving this movie great reviews...it's just sad that those kinds of people actually exist."
"kbdesigns-621-176470","4","4","9","18 February 2018"," Even game characters play better and have better CGI...
","I knew that DC wanted to have something like Avengers but... this was really bad, bad acting, worst Batman ever, Cyborg... ok, let's just say that old Robocop was better done and flash.. ok, flash was funny. But the whole movie wasn't good at all and after awesome ""batmans"" with Christian Bale with actual well written scripts I don't think they will ever go back to that level. Suicide Squad was much better. This was really boring with really no interesting script, no new ideas and poor special effects.."
"graves-scott","8","4","9","16 February 2018"," DC almost got it perfect!
","Look, first off any movie made today can't have the kind of hopefulness that comic books from our youth had. You just can't sell hopefulness to millennials. They can't take hope, they've been fed a constant diet of doom and gloom all their lives and hope is a toxin to their system. No doom and gloom and it may as well be the Smurfs for them. So we of the generations raised on science fiction and super hero stories filled with hope for the future just have to accept that and celebrate what little bits of hope they allow us these days. Can't deal with it? Get Hulu and watch TV from the 80's, 90's and early 2000's.<br/><br/>With that lead weight hanging around the necks of those trying to write good science fiction and superhero stories we're lucky they don't have all the heroes in black with a chest full of awareness ribbons spending most of the movie preaching to the normals about how much the earth has been screwed up by their greed and short sightedness. In light of that the MCU has managed to dance that fine line like a ballet dancer while the DC folks have been dancing the line like a drunken Irishman at a DWI stop. However in this movie I think they got pretty darned close, more like an average joe with only one beer in them. <br/><br/>Maybe it's just me, I've always given super hero movies a lot of slack. Heck, I enjoyed the Green Lantern movie.<br/><br/>I will give you it's hard given the current political climate to just make an entertaining movie. What with every stripe of political animal ready to march, boycott and write emails to sponsors over things you'd never imagine could be taken offense to what's a guy to do? Super hero stories are going to be harder than most. The costumes alone can generate four years of college material for a Womyn's Studies Major. You can't put everyone in the same lumpy jumpsuits and hope to make that fly after all. <br/><br/>With that particular Sword of Damocles hangin' over their heads I am happy if the costumes are close enough, the characterizations are decent and their origin stories from the 60's and 70's aren't totally polluted with todays PC garbage. Justice League took it to the line and held it there the whole time bringing us the best movie we could hope for with all the forces of PC darkness standing against them. <br/><br/>So relax the politics people and just try to enjoy the movies. I'm giving it an 8 because I think that's what it deserves. Not trying to overcome the low voters who did so for whatever reasons they may have had or trying to hold down those who high voted it because of some other reasons. Maybe I could have given it a 7 but the easter egg made me give it a +1. You know what I mean... Brunch... Yup. Brunch."
"zeltmanis","1","4","9","11 February 2018"," So much CGI that I did not understand, I am watching Toy Story or what?
","Thigs that make this movie bad:<br/><br/>1) The CGI or green screen. There is so much, that I feel watching a cartoon - Toy Story or something. Please stop that!
2) Batman suit - just bad. That moment when he show his bruises it looks like he is vearing a batman T-shirt. Come one - Cristina Bale had an awesome Batsuit, where did it go? You throw it in the garbage?
3) Supermens CGI on mustache. It even sound ridicules.
4) Saving the world from aliens - again. If you are planing to make several movies, then start small. How about saving a neighborhood. Then move on to the city, then state etc. You can't start first film by saving the whole world. There is no much room for improvement. And what? Next movies again - saving world, again from aliens? Now all the superhero movies look so similar, there is an alien that wants to rule the earth. And there is a box that has all the power in the galactic. Next movie, same shit just different alien. 
5) In Soviet Russia - there are no old American pick-ups. There are no pick-ups at all. 
6) The cheesy texts that the curators say - com on... lame
7) Please stop making shitty movies and waste money and time. If you can't make a good one, then don't. Again, don't try to impress viewers with CGI, if I want good graphics, I play video game. I know, CGI makes special effects a lot cheaper, but then don't try to make it so huge."
"Random3","3","4","9","4 December 2017"," The Most Marvel-y Film to Never Marvel...
","DC are now five films into their Cinematic Universe and they still haven't figured it out.<br/><br/>It made me laugh throughout because of how Marvel-y the film is. They have dialled back the dark depressing moodiness from the previous Superman films and replaced it with silly one-liners that feel horribly out of place. Rather than have the balls to stick to their guns but try to make it, you know, not trash, they decided to backtrack and make something that was done infinitely better by Marvel 5 years ago.<br/><br/>And it even fails at doing that properly. Rather than integrate the various superpowers organically into the plot of the film, three out of the five members of the Justice League could literally be anyone else. Batman does some Batman stuff, and there are a couple of scenes where someone needed to move really fast, so Flash was useful every now and then, but there was nothing in here that specifically used either Wonder Woman, Aquaman or Cyborg's superpowers, other than needing ""a guy who is really fast and really strong"". So if you went into this film with no preconception of who was who and what they could each do, you would be seeing a guy dressed as a bat with some cool gadgets, an annoying teenager who can run really really fast, and three interchangeable characters who can all punch people really hard.<br/><br/>That is my main problem with the film but here are a few other spoiler-free bullet points:<br/><br/>-90% of the comic relief was from the Flash, and the only times I laughed were at non-Flash related bits. <br/><br/>-Think of the least interesting villain possible. I guarantee you the villain in this will be less interesting than that. He was literally ""evil guy who wants to do evil with magic MacGuffins and destroy earth."" <br/><br/>-Sick of seeing infinite armies of faceless robots/aliens/insects/zombies that are decidedly non-human so that we can show the heroes decapitating and dismembering them without affecting the PG13 rating? Well, Justice League has you covered! They have an infinite army of faceless robot-alien-insect-zombie things all at once!<br/><br/>I am kinda ripping this film a new poop-hole but it wasn't as bad as BvS or Suicide Squad. It was watchable but in a ""this is trash"" kinda way. Much of the film felt like scenes taking place in a vacuum, with nothing connecting them. Most of these scenes on their own were entertaining enough, but as a film it didn't do anything for me. 4/10.<br/><br/>For anyone curious I would rank the DC films as follows:<br/><br/>1. Wonder Woman (5/10) 2. Man of Steel (5/10) 3. Justice League (4/10) 4. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (4/10) 5. Suicide Squad (3/10)"
"lazykevin013","10","4","9","21 November 2017"," Great movie overall
","Great movie! There is 1 problem though and that it is too short. Some scenes will make you ask yourself why didn't they explain that part more.<br/><br/>One example is the location of Atlantis, I mean Aquaman was just roaming around the coast near the village he live(I think that's where he lives) then voila, he's in Atlantis. To top it off, he seemed to be in the center of Atlantis where they keep the mother box. lol<br/><br/>I loved the scene where Flash was surprised when Superman was able to follow him even though he was moving at super speed. haha"
"Paynebyname","3","4","9","20 November 2017"," An embarrassing and lazy mess of a film
","Wow, I went in with very low expectations but this really was shockingly bad. Everything from blatant exposition from random characters at the beginning, through to ridiculous poster style shots whenever they get the chance - it was just bad.<br/><br/>The CGI on Steppenwolf was cringe worthy and genuinely felt like he wasn't there, the opening action scenes to re-establish the characters were ridiculous, the script had no spark or energy in it and everyone (including the director and writer) just seemed to be sleep walking through the whole production.<br/><br/>Their lazy arrogance that having a number of characters on the screen is all that you need is just amazing. Have these people learnt nothing from MoS, BvS or SS? I wasn't expecting great things but I thought it might have some good set pieces but I was genuinely stumbling around trying to see or hear something that was genuinely cool or entertaining.<br/><br/>Cavill still can't act for **** - apart from the one scene as Superman where he was asked what he likes about Earth. Unfortunately you never find out in what was probably the most memorable scene of the film. Affleck looks bored and unengaged, Miller tries too hard, Mamoa isn't given any decent material and Gadot is reduced to a series of embarrassing bottom or cleavage shots.<br/><br/>And really, the mother boxes. What kind of dumb ass name is that? And as for the Lois Lane monologue at end, I couldn't stop laughing at how overly dramatic and self important it was.<br/><br/>You really do have to laugh at DC and Warner, their execs seem like the most moronic fools around. They make an okay film in WW and don't study that to try to understand what was right with it. No, just barrel on with pretty pictures and literally nothing else.<br/><br/>Their contempt for their audience and their lack of effort or creativity is staggering. I'm astonished to say that I think this is even worse than BvS. What a real stinker."

I could see if it got just HORRIBLE reviews. (I'd still see it thou) But it got pretty good reviews so far,and deserves it. It deserves much better especially by the critics. But again who cares. The fans are enjoying it. And you will leave the theater very happy. Each character had its own great moments. And they played very well together. But from beginning to end it has your attention.

Few problem were that it was short & was rushed at times in the sense of story line plus some CGI effects looked gloomy & mediocre moreover the villain was weak but apart from that this movie is boisterous, bad ass & a wild ride. The opening scenes was one of the best scenes ever shown in the comic movie plus the comic depiction of these heroes have been perfect especially of Batman & Superman moreover the visions and the cinematography was magnificent & seemed on point & was exactly depicted from the comic strips & the post credit scenes was one of the best ever shown in any movie predicting a great trilogy ahead Superman was great, Batman was cool AF, Flash was humorous, Aquaman was bad ass , Cyborg was captivating & Wonder Woman was of course gorgeous & was all positive All the heroes rolled very well together with a positive vibe & with an essence of heroism I LOVED IT SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!!"
"franksterhan","8","4","9","17 November 2017"," Keeping DC's Movies On The Right Track
","Before reading this review I'd like to point out that I am not a professional movie critic. I'm simply just a fan of movies, and like to talk about something I love so much. So take this review however you like, but for a true movie impression, I suggest seeing the movie and making your own conclusions.<br/><br/>Leading up to the release of Justice League left me overly concerned with whether or not the movie would flop or not, rather than wondering about the story line of the movie, and what cool things will be in it. Rest at ease, the movie was a not only what you would expect from the trailers, but better.<br/><br/>For those of you like myself who are big in the DC comics, you will find the trailers didn't give away everything. The do a great job of not only tying in previously released movies, but DC movies yet to come. And some of these tie ins will definitely leave you not only speechless, but excited to see the other installments, as they do not revile enough to let you know whats going to happen in those movies, just that something is going to happen. And for those of you who do not read the comics, the tie-ins are not only refreshing, but they keep you wondering more, and bring up some good questions to ask yourself on the drive home.<br/><br/>For the rest of the movie may not live up to the standers that Wonder Woman left, it definitely did its best to get there if not trying to scratch the surface. The amount of gloaming darkness in this installment is less than previous films, but still enough to stay far on the dark side of movies, keeping the movies vibe far away from the more comedic Marvel installments. And as for the humor that is in the movie, worry not, there is more than what is just in the trailers. The way the movies humor worked was not only fitting, but played in well with the dark and gloomy atmosphere, leaving it refreshing when it happened, and didn't throw the movie to far off pace with just dry humor remark, after dry humor remark.<br/><br/>What the movie lacked was not explaining where the villain in this story comes from, and how he gets his power. His motives unfortunately to someone who have never read the comics seem to be the usually take over the word because I'm a bad guy, even though it is not the case, and the movie fails to bring this part of our villain to light.<br/><br/>All in all the movie is not only a success, but worth watching, and something I plan on watching again within the next few weeks."
"thachphamvu","9","4","9","17 November 2017"," How a ""super heroes league"" movie should be made
","To be honest, I should give a 8 instead of a 9 but this is for encouraging the film makers and actors in the movies. The reason why critics do not give a high rating for this movies is simply because they have been looking at it under the same old scope based on previous Marvel movies. This movie, to me, is how a super heroes league movie should be made.<br/><br/>Now a few points:<br/><br/><ul><li>If you are expecting to have a fun time, you'll get it from JL.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If you are expecting awesome characters with great acting skills, you'll get it. The movie gives a lot of time for new characters like Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg to develop.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If you are expecting to see the coolest Aquaman in history, you definitely are gonna get it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If you are looking for great emotional interactions and attack combination between all super heroes and not just the main ones - the thing that Marvel has completely failed to do, you will get it in JL. After JL, you will have a very clear understand on how heroes feel about each others. For example, how Batman sees the Flash, how Wonder Woman sees Cyborg and many many more. All interactions are logical and not forceful in anyway.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The actions are way way cooler than in avengers, all the movements of the characters are clear and the effects are tremendous. I watched Avengers in 3D and remembered that I cannot see all the action because it was too messy and fast. In justice league, they do know how to make use of the 3D glasses.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Now, the only downside of this movie is the villains which is a little bit lame but to be honest, Loki is of the same level in terms of strength (not as a character in later marvel's movies, but as a villain in Avenger first movie). Another downside is just my personal taste, which is I don't like superman to be that strong in every movies, make him vulnerable a bit will you, Zach?</li></ul><br/><br/>In conclusion, JL is a great superhero movies and raise the bar in how you should develop multiple characters in a movie. It is not yet perfect but you will be satisfied with what the film is heading towards to. It opens a door for all the single hero movies in the future. The casts are great and way better than in Avengers. The spotlights of the movies are Ezra Miller and Jason Momoa where they steal the show multiple times. Wonder Woman and Batman appears less so that they can give the stage to the new characters, which is something Avengers failed to do. Finally, go see the movie and don't hesitate even one bit!"
"anupapu8","8","4","9","17 November 2017"," Better then Dawn Of Justice , just because it does less sily things.
","Justice League - Before, i want to talk about something else. Something i didn't liked , a step backward . And although my rating will not affect due to these points , but i don't want these things to happen again. As we know earlier this year Wonder Woman released. And it did something Hollywood hadn't done yet. It made a successful Female superhero film , with empowerment and without objectifying Woman . . I mean it really raised the interest of female fans. But this movie takes a step backward. And the twitter is full of such angry comments. 1. First the dress of Amazonian warriors were really revealing , which were not in wonder woman. Even in the short time you can notice it. 2. There were quite a few number of BUTT shots with Gal Gadot wearing tight pants , and camera took her pic from behind putting her butt in the middle of the screen. Thats bad really bad. 3. A lot of Sexist jokes. a)In one scene Flash fall over Wonder Woman his face right in front of her cleavage. b) Then while aquaman was talking about each and every member one by one , when reach to Wonder Woman at-last he says She is very attractive . What does that mean , he doesn't have another description for her apart from being eye-candy to the team . c) In Another scene where Gal Gadot was going to talk to Cyborg for the first time , Alfred says SEEMS LIKE U GOT A DATE . I mean why does he has to say it. He knows she is going to talk to him for joining the team. 4. And Lois Lane . Don't even talk about her. The movie doesn't even show her as a reporter , she is just a love interest of Superman , saying sentences to superman like U SMELL GOOD. Doesn't these Woman have self respect. These were some really bad things , which could hurt the female audience. And i don't want DCEU to move to this direction . Woman characters must not be objectified for the sake of producing Jokes. Thank God Wonder Woman has been directed by a female director. Only god knows what will happen to the BATGIRL movie which Joss WEADON is directing as well writing. <br/><br/>So that being said . i promise i will not rate this movie any lower for above reasons. Because i liked and enjoyed the film , in-spite of those points. This one is better then Dawn Of Justice not because it has a better story , infect the story is pretty simple and there were not much complications like it was in case of Dawn Of Justice , but because this movie is very safe and does few silly things. <br/><br/>But the movie was rushed . As WB ordered to cut it to under 2 hrs. That was a wrong decision creatively , but i think WB is pretty much business minded right now thinking of how much Dawn of Justice underperformed(it must have earned a billion which it didn't) and how Blade Runner 2049 get bombed at box office , length of the movie being a major reason.I hope we got to see the extended version when the bluray comes out. Also The whole JOss Weadon light hearted moments , although works sometimes and the audience did laughed a lot , more then me , but the movie could have worked better without them . I really wanted this film to be serious. Its different to get humorous sometimes. Even Nolan use to inject jokes in between Dark Knight trilogy , but those were so less in numbers and so much driven by the plot and characters that they never hurt the tone of the film. Its not the same here. It gets cheeky sometimes. I really don't mind the standalone movies to be light hearted , like it was in case of Wonder Woman , but when it comes to the team movie , it had to be serious , so that stakes could be felt higher. <br/><br/>But again , i laughed even i wanted it to be serious. And the action scenes works. Big time. Even the smaller fights. U will enjoys the fights. <br/><br/>Some more back stories would have been really nice, the whole team just came together too quick . We didn't get to know the character's personal life , specially about Aquaman. I really hoped more scenes of Amber Heard as Mera(yes i like her , even after her controversial divorce with Johney Depp and her flop carrier) . Hope that extended cut (if ever will come) can add some scenes of her.Or i will have to wait for the Aquaman movie. <br/><br/>Talking about Individual characters , Superman was the best thing about this film. And believe me i am a Batman fan . This Superman version of Zack Snyder is very conflicted , a lone survivor in an alien planet. And even being just in less then half of the movie , Superman really elevates the film. They did really interesting things with Superman. One of which is the competing fast moving power of Superman and Flash. <br/><br/>2nd will be cyborg . He is a real value addition . And at the time of him still finding out what he can do , its really interesting to watch him. <br/><br/>Danny Elfman must not get to give music in any DCEU movie again. He was very average . Like he was in Age Of Ultron. Junky Xl or Zimmer could have made this movie so much better. <br/><br/>7.7/10<br/><br/>by ANuP APu KuMaR"

","this is the movie that DC fans and comic book fans in general were asking for. The League UNITED, with their different abilities to fight the greater threat. the way they introduced the characters was genius. however, this movie is not perfect, but its fun to watch, and has many many WooooooooooooW moments. the way they brought superman to life was brave and it really works for me. now the worst thing in this movie for me were the villain and Batman, they made batman the least powerful and the least impotent member of the league. now let us talk about this, they gave us DEATHSTROKE !!!! so it means that batman solo movie is happening. overall for me this movie deserve 8/10 at least."

","Being a DC fan all my life, this movie was something I was really waiting for. It's somewhat disappointing then when, never having read a Marvel comic in my life, I enjoyed the movie ""The Avengers"" more. <br/><br/>No doubt one of the biggest issues was the length of the movie. Everything seemed to be somewhat rushed, and not even when the Flash was on the screen. The choice of villain was poor too - Steppenwolf is hardly known by any non-DC comic book reader, which wouldn't provide a good stepping point for any new fans. <br/><br/>But I do admit - I was secretly expecting a surprise at the end of the movie, and didn't receive one. The most obvious one I hoped for was the arrival of the Green Lantern Hal Jordan. I know I'm being a traditionalist here, but he was a member of the JL way before Cyborg was even considered. As it happened, there was no surprise.<br/><br/>The movie started really quite well and definitely piqued my interest, particularly with the battle on Themyscira. Unfortunately by the end of the film, I left the cinema feeling flat. Aquaman and Cyborg were both bit players, and we learned nothing of their origins (nor the Flash's). And the final battle just seemed to involve a lot of hitting in a less than spectacular setting.<br/><br/>I really wanted to love this film. Unfortunately I just liked it. The teaser for the next film looks promising, so lets hope we get the DC smack-down we're all hoping for soon."

If the movie didn't flow well with previous movies that is because bat v sup is a dumpster fire that this movie was trying to put out. The graphics weren't bad and it wasn't there fault that Superman's upper lip was weird. See he was contractually obligated to keep the mustache so they had to match a CGI face to a real one which is really really hard.<br/><br/>The villain of the story on the hand wasn't so great, but lets be real. The Chitauri in the avengers was pretty lame. Way worse than these. Loki is far better then stephenwolf, but even then we are talking apples and oranges. They aren't comparable. The movie was good well done. With developed characters, and reasonable reactions. It was consistent with itself. This has been the first DC movie to impress me. Keep it up DC and do the comics I loved justice! :D"

The movie is not a movie made for ""grown-ups"", as the kids would say, and when I say that this movie should have been made by Disney, I don't mean the Disney I, among many, grew up with. I mean the new generation Disney movies like Frozen, that follow the modern day trends and are the cartoon version of blockbusters[I'm not gonna dig deeper into this because it's off topic, but .. well .. it's not pretty]. 
So, first things first ... nah ! , I can't help myself, the part in the end when the ""justice league"" win the battle against what's-his-face, suddenly flowers start blooming and green stuff starts growing everywhere? Was that for real ? I couldn't believe what I was watching and my sudden reaction was to start laughing. Couldn't help it! 
That aside, the fact is that when I pressed the play button I knew, more of less, what kind of movie I was going to watch and of course I didn't think I was gonna watch anything sophisticated. But at least I was hoping for entertainment. Shallow entertainment, but still entertainment!

Batman v Superman was also a mess, but at least it was consistent with itself. This goes all over the place.<br/><br/>The good: Supes' return. It was emotional and powerful.

","I am one of the people who had hope for Justice League, wonder woman was great I loved every second of it. But this film does not deliver. As I watched this movie I noticed many flaws right off the bat. Lets start with the beginning, Batman was the opener of this film, you find him catching a cat burglar, yet he wants to find Steppen Wolfs minion. He finds the minion and it blows up for no apparent reason except to advance the plot. There is no introduction at all, nothing, not who these creatures are or where they came from. And on another note, don't these creatures only come to Earth with the villain. Later on Bruce Wayne is with Alfred on his jet and you can tell immediately when Ben Affleck sits down, its CGI. The side shot of his face is CGI. Later on you get a horrible into to what could have been, possibly, a good villain. Steppen Wolf just shows up at themyscira out of no where, that was a terrible intro. We get a horrible CGI Cyborg. And Aquaman is barely in the movie for the first half. Speaking of Aquaman, he had a barely any dialogue and a lot of one liners. He and Flash were so cringe. Superman is in the film for twenty minutes. Wonder Woman is the only redeeming quality. She had some good scenes, I won't lie. And at one point Batman magically transfers from his Bat Plane to his Batmobile, like what the actual crap. Now, Steppen Wolf was a lousy villain, he was barely in the film and when he was, he was extremely boring. The dialouge was garbage. They stole ideas from Xmen Days of Future Past with the slowmotion flash scene with helping wonder woman. The pace of the movie was to fast, they tore through everything in the trailer within 40 minutes. The movie was 2 hours with credits, this should at least been two hours and twenty minutes with credits. And I believe this movie should have been released later, and let the movies for Aquaman, Flash, and Cyborg been released and then come out with this film. All n all this movie was boring, fasted pased, and had nothing going for it. I hope there isn't a sequel."

Batman was so water down, I never liked wonder women, nothing against Gal Gadot, she seems sweet and a nice person off camera, but as an actress ? horrible, she might need more acting lessons. The flash was so lame man, his jokes were cringly. The only two characters that were okay, was superman and cyborg. And last thing? The CGI?

","All great movies have one common goal in one way or another and that is to make the audience member feel apart of their world, I've wanted to be part of this world since I read my first DC comic at 5. Justice League accomplishes this and more. From the moment it began It had me and didn't let go until the end of the credits. I laughed, I even got a little teary eyed at some points! The action was great and the character development was on point. The CG with some of the parts of the movie where a little iffy but what can you expect from a larger than life movie, these things have no impact on the story. The story-line was solid with very humorous moments sprinkled throughout the duration and keep me wanting more. I'm a fan of all comics so I don't understand the Marvel Vs DC thing but I can say this If you are a fan of any of these characters you owe it to yourself to watch this film!"
"romano-zanki888","3","3","6","21 November 2017"," Another fail from DC,could this be the end
","I will keep this short cause there isn't much to say. First of all i don't get it how CGI could be worse then in man of steel or BVS but it somehow is. But that is least of its problems,bigger issue is little to none character development (could be due the WB 2 hour mark which could not be exceeded) Marvel done this much better by making standalone hero movies before Avengers. little spoiler alert The villain is just a very very poor pick after Zod and Doomsday they pick Steppenwolf which is boring even in comics. Superman has about 2 min screen time as Superman,5 min as Clark Kent. does 2 min are the best in the movie. They did manage to demonstrate how ridiculous Justice league is and useless compared to Superman.He did in 10 sec (thats how much time he spent in last fight)what the league was trying to do in 2 hours.And with incredible ease. And to top it all the climax of the movie the last great fight is the worst action sequence in the movie ,it is just that bad. For me the whole movie looked like lets just get this over with already,half of the cast looked bored even by filming it. I am actually shocked how they managed to screw up something that should have at least been a fun action packed movie.i love both dc and marvel for better or for worse but DC just doesn't seem it can get it right ,they are always close but just not there yet,and they are running out of time. you can actually watch few trailers and when you watch a movie you have a feeling you watched it already"

"james_cooperwaite","10","3","6","21 November 2017"," Highly Enjoyable for any Comic book super-hero fan
","I was so nervous about liking this movie. Given the poor to mixed reviews of all other DCEU movies aside from 'Wonder Woman', the initial critical response made me feel even more dread at the fact that DC cannot get this franchise rolling. However, if you are a superhero fan, throw that critical response out of the window. Listen to the comic book guys, the YouTube superhero vloggers and GO SEE THIS MOVIE.<br/><br/>Yes, objectively, the movie does suffer from pacing issues and the main villain is under-developed but the Justice League members are wonderfully brought to life. Every single character in the league has so much personality for you to like and each character has enough space for development in their upcoming movies, it's intriguing and exciting. I would also like to contradict the growing opinion that Ben Affleck's Batman and Ray Fisher's Cyborg are weak. I completely disagree with this, Batman has gone through a significant change and they have moved him far closer to a Batman we might expect but he still has a lot of room to grow as well. Cyborg is shown to be quite troubled but very cool and possibly has the most intriguing function of the entire team. Everyone loves the Flash, Aquaman and Wonder Woman but my highlight for the movie is the change in Superman, he is completely different which is so refreshing and his scenes and chemistry with the Flash are just great to watch and you can't help but smile.<br/><br/>Admittedly, my score is a little inflated and on the current theatrical release it should be closer to a 7 or 8, but the reason I gave it higher was because I believe this is not the final version of this movie we shall see. The two main issues of the movie, mentioned previously, can quite simply be solved by giving characters more screen- time and dialogue. Everybody is expecting there to be a huge extension to this movie given the Warner Bros. mandate of the 2-hour restriction. This means that there could potentially be huge amounts of film set to come into this movie, from the trailers alone, that will develop the characters more and explain the plot in more detail. I also have confidence in this because they have done this before with BvS. I hated the theatrical release it was such a poor production and the editing guys messed up. They have taken a lot out of this one too but have not spoiled the movie this time, thank goodness, so it's certain there will be good footage to come. Finally, Zack Snyder and his team do like to write a complete story, it was arguably even a bit convoluted and contained too many layers and symbolism in BvS, so I am certain any kinks are ironed out in the DVD release.<br/><br/>I love the Marvel movies to bits, but I am more of a DC guy and I desperately want this franchise to start moving in the right direction and I think this movie signals a change to a more character driven universe. I actually enjoyed the tone of 'Man of Steel' and 'BvS: Ultimate Edition', and the approach of making the characters experience a journey of self-discovery and creating a universe where the superheroes are constantly being challenged by the people they are protecting, it makes it more real. I think the theme of most if not all of the DCEU movies was going to be ""where do I fit in the world"", or ""what is my role in all of this"" and that defining of self was going to drive these character on stories of discovery. This movie shifts that emphasis to be more about the personalities the characters already have and how they can bring life to a story. This is a very Marvel approach to writing, so whether you like that or not the movie certainly benefits from giving these characters room to breathe and not suffocating them in dreary personal pressures. There were still seeds of the original theme in this movie, a major part of Barry Allen's personality is that he is very awkward, Aquaman's life is without direction and Cyborg is somewhat of a recluse; so they can return to this theme nicely going forward but this movie took the right approach for what the franchise needed.<br/><br/>Overall guys, you will enjoy these characters despite the pacing issues. If you are new to DC comics characters it might help to read up a little on the characters they are bringing in to help in the immediate term but I am certain the DVD release will complete this movie for how it was meant to be and improve on an already thrilling and exciting movie experience."

"static-25910","3","3","6","20 November 2017"," Just stop the DC universe, it's already beyond saving
","I really love DC, I don't love their movies<br/><br/>Wonder Woman inspired hope that there really could be something salvageable in the DC cinematic universe but this film just ripped all that away.<br/><br/>The film itself isn't completely awful, there are some great scenes particularly when superman fights off the other members of the league, but really the movie has much more bad than good. It has characters that have never been introduced, and not just minor characters, major members of the League itself. Some characters are not present at all *cough* Green Lantern *cough* for no other reason than just that they aren't there. Because of these notable absences of both characters and characterisation and backstory, the film shoe horns in barely related content such as Atlantis and Jim Gordon just to show the audience that they exist, they add nothing to the movie. Superman is brought back in the most generic boring way possible, and now, because he died so early on, stakes go out the window. No one cares if a character dies because A. we don't know who they are and B. They can just be brought back whenever. <br/><br/>Steppenwolf is a terrible villain on multiple levels. His presence is never felt during the film. If he's not on screen he might as well not exist. He doesn't feel like a threat, especially compared with Loki in the first Avengers film. Secondly he is quite clearly related to Darksied, the big bad of the DC universe, which means when Darksied does eventually show up we've seen pretty much seen him already, as Steppenwolf is from the same place, uses the same henchman, and has the same goals. The film manages to simultaneously have a terrible villain and ruin a future villain.<br/><br/>The after credits scene also suffers. Most after credits scenes are either a setup for future events or a little extra comedy and Justice League utilises both. The latter is actually decent, featuring the Flash and Superman gearing up for a race, it's harmless fun. The former however is terrible, it has Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor (the worst casting choice in the history of super hero movies) and a never before seen Deathstroke, scheming about forming a league of villains. This doesn't work because other than these two characters and Jared Leto's joker, there are no other villains in the DC Universe! If we had seen other movies such as Aquaman or Flash we would have villains like Black Manta or Captain Cold who could conceivably join the injustice league but we haven't so no hype is built up.<br/><br/>With all this in mind, Justice League doesn't feel like an event. When the Avengers came out it was a spectacle, all these characters who had either had there own movies or been in other movies came together to fight a big bad. Justice League is 3 characters we've seen before, three we've never seen before, and one who isn't even in the film. It's disjointed scenes trying to give as much backstory as possible, never focusing on the imminent threat until the third act. It shows how an improper and rushed setup for a cinematic universe eventually leads to failure.<br/><br/>Seriously, why wasn't Green Lantern in this movie??? they had three other characters we've never seen before in it! What difference would one more make??? <br/><br/>THEY HAD DEATHSTROKE INSTEAD OF GREEN LANTERN!?!?!"

Ie Other critics are rating it harshly I better too. In no way is Justice League worse than Thor: The Dark World (which is Marvel's lowest scoring movie with an RT of 56%) but for whatever reason critics are particularly hateful when it comes to Zach Snyder's works. Again he isn't perfect but his movies are certainly better than the critical reception. <br/><br/>If you like superhero movies then you'll like Justice League.

I'd see a standalone movie with each of their characters if it were done well. But my sweet lord... why can't they get this universe right? I want to like it! These are awesome characters (not just in this film, in all the DCEU films so far). The source material is excellent. The actors are solid. It comes down to the writing, the directing, and the guidance of the studio. They just can't get it right. Even the CGI was absolute garbage. With the budget they had, there's no excuse for how bad the effects were, especially on Steppenwolf, Cyborg and Cavill's now infamous upper lip.<br/><br/>They have to make major changes. Zack Snyder cannot be allowed to touch these films anymore. He's a one-note director, and that one note is incredibly dull. WB also needs to either put new people in charge of the universe or give up the rights, since it's clear the current leadership doesn't know what they're doing with these characters on the big screen. New EPs are desperately needed who will actually see this dreck and force changes rather than just yessing it through the system. Who actually thought this was a fitting representation of the greatest superhero team in the comic world? How could they let something so clearly subpar hit the screen?

Unfortunately, Justice League is unable to improve on any of these secondhand moments. Instead, a villain with a horned helmet (who is not Loki, Ares, Hela, Surtur, or Incubus) seeks to destroy the world with the help of a faceless CGI army (that isn't the Chitauri, the things from Suicide Squad, the Draugr, or the Dark Elves) and a cube of pure power (not the Tesaract). The character introductions were heavy handed as a result of having to bring in three new heroes and the tone was largely dark with occasional moments of levity. The Flash was the only real source of humor and that was undermined by the mopey serious behavior of the rest of the characters. The Flash's big action scene was essentially a worse version of the Quicksilver scene from ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" <br/><br/>Really nothing from Justice League stood out, and even an hour after seeing it, I'm already starting to forget what happened. I felt like I had already because it was essentially copying the formula Marvel used in ""The Avengers"" but with a more bloated storyline that tried to force in too many characters (Commissioner Gordon served no purpose) and Zack Snyder's signature joylessness."
"sirwillisiv","4","3","6","19 November 2017"," A big step backward for DCEU...
","Justice League is a cluttered tonal jumble with cheap writing, wooden characters, intermittent pacing, and a wasted supporting cast. Yet, the action was a decent surge of popcorn thrills. If Zack Synder can master anything, it's imagery, and it wasn't Transformers level of blaring. It was neat to see Aqua Man, Flash, and Cyborg do their thing for a couple set-pieces, but their individual narratives should've launched beforehand. Their rushed introductions could not generate an affective connection, therefore I could careless what happened to them or how they interacted with Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. I hate to make a forced comparison to The Avengers, but those characters are complex, endearing and their colorful personalties play of each other adequately. The Justice League are insipid bores. Definitely not a good film, and that irritates me because I want this film universe to succeed, it should be amazing, and Wonder Woman was such a return to form. Justice League, however, was a big step backward."
"peeradon","7","3","6","19 November 2017"," A childhood animation came to life, but not the final product we deserve.
","So many scenes were not here, the studio messed it up again. And such a bad bad decision for them to let go of the advantages of their iconic movie franchise, the scores are average at best. I used to back them up when they brought Elfman into this project and even said to give the guy a chance. But still my heart wants those tunes from the few scenes which is what we got left from Zimmer and Junkie XL. Snyder's music choice for the intro is beautiful as ever. I tear up at this part with the thought of how this movie will turn out to be if he can stay till the very end to finish his own movie of his dream. I can't and I won't blame Whedon for this. But I personally need the original version of this movie. It's not a bad movie, hell it's like a dream come true for us fans. I enjoyed almost every bit of it. But to be honest, I'm not satisfied."
"dbwesa","6","3","6","19 November 2017"," Expecting worse, but not happily disappointed
","Let me premise this by stating that in no way is this meant to kick Snyder when he's down. As a father I feel for him and his family. But that being said, and this being primarily his work, I truly feel that WB and DC would be best served to remove him from any further script input. <br/><br/>The Superman/Batman universe is significantly stronger than Marvel, but with this being the 3rd poor adaptation of these characters, i find it inexcusable that I found only ONE scene of this movie actually exciting. I will say that i loved the use of the Tim Burton Batman soundtrack, but the glimmer of John Williams superman theme was not NEARLY enough and superman did not get his moment in the sun, i mean that literally and figuratively. <br/><br/>There is no excuse for poor cgi in these films. The budgets are disgustingly large and every artist is available to them to clean it up, but glitches persist. But if i look aside the cgi faults, the dark lighting, i am left with a gaping hole of where i expected a compelling story that MAKES SENSE. The only explanation is that the script was Snyder'd. The audience can not get invested in a character, cyborg and aqua man, just by throwing them at us. Flash is developed pretty well, but the other two are not and they spend a significant amount of time on screen. The justice league was not ready yet to be formed. <br/><br/>I love Henry Cavill as Superman, and i don't want them to waste his career the way X- men wasted Hugh Jackman's by never writing a script worth a damn for the character. <br/><br/>Take a step back and FOCUS ON THE STORY! Give us a great story, and the money will follow, guaranteed! Unfortunately I was bored until the final credit scene. A much more compelling story is coming."

","It was good, but nothing special. The thing that ruined this movie was it had no set up, I suppose as a sequel to Batman vs Superman, it didn't really need one. However, it just jumped into the action without any explanation.<br/><br/>The whole film was just rushed. When you've got a studio trying to play catch up when it really doesn't need to, you have these problems.<br/><br/>I could see Joss Whedon's contribution and that's what killed it for me. It was too gooey, too soft, too slapstick. Not serious enough. No major themes were explored. Batman vs Superman had a little gravity to it. This film just stank of the Avenger's model, it didn't have any villain presence. Just a smash till he dies vibe to the whole movie.<br/><br/>The unnecessary inclusion of civilians you couldn't give two tosses about.<br/><br/>No, one, character actually stood out. They were all so dry and looked bored throughout. You can tell the whole thing changed tones.<br/><br/>If you want to waste money one day, go and see it, but I'd wait till the Blu Ray uncut version comes out. At least then the story will hold together a little better and I might add a point to the rating ..."
"oliviermartin","3","3","6","18 November 2017"," Thumbs down for the Justice League.
","The movie has it's good points, but it also has A LOT of problems. Also, let's be honest here: it's a ripoff of the 2012 Avengers movie. No, seriously, compare them side-to-side and you'll quickly notice that Justice League steals a lot of stuff from The Avengers. Both feature an alien villain (Steppenwolf and Loki) of divine origin (New God and Asgardian) leading an army of mindless gray-skinned aliens (Parademons and Chitauri) to Earth in order to retrieve powerful artifacts and conquer the planet, requiring a group of superheroes to form a team and learn to work together to fight them back (after the heroes argue and butt heads with each other for a bit, of course). Additionally, the artifacts in question are both cube-shaped (the Mother Boxes and the Tesseract), and both would-be conquerors are servants of characters who are themselves Counterpart Comparisons from their respective comic book mythologies (DC's Darkseid and Marvel's Thanos). Also, both movies try to have multiple jokes in them to ""ease"" the atmosphere (Justice League isn't really good at it, BTW) and both superhero teams are being led by a ""badass normal"" type character who relies more on martial arts skills and strategy than anything else (Batman and Captain America). Plus, what happened to the colors in these movies? It's like some idiot decided to put a crappy color filter or something...the movie's brightness is so low that I sometimes have to constantly squint at the screen to know what the hell I'm looking at. Looking at the movie sometimes hurts my eyes. Also, some of the actors do a good job while others...not so much."
"rockman182","5","3","6","18 November 2017"," Justice League (2017)
","I was of the camp that thought Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice, wasn't good but wasn't terrible either. With Wonder Woman coming out earlier this year and being a very fun time, you would have hoped the DC Extended Universe would get on track and continue to impress with Justice League. Warning signs were that the film somehow managed to look worse with every new trailer but I gave the film the benefit of the doubt. Yeah, this thing sucks.<br/><br/>An ancient super being named Steppenwolf is trying to collect mother boxes to destroy the Earth and its up to a group of superheroes to band and unite to contain the threat. Batman and Wonder Woman attempt to recruit a hero of the sea (Aquaman), a cybernetically reconstructed former athlete (Cyborg), and an awkward kid who is very, very fast (Flash). Oh yeah, worst keep secret ever as well they also attempt to revive the recently fallen Superman.<br/><br/>Here are some of the positives. I didn't have any problems with any of the casting choices. I obviously love Gadot as Wonder Woman, as she fully embodies the character. Affleck as Batman is solid. Momoa has a bad ass warrior look that works for Aquaman, and the comedic timing of Ezra Miller as Flash works. Actually Flash's fresh humor in this DCEU effort is actually the other strong point of this film. You would think that this film would be able to do a decent job of uniting DC's most popular characters but it really doesn't do a satisfying job of it.<br/><br/>Justice League is one of the most expensive films ever made. Its hard to believe because the graphics look choppy and messy. Its almost as if parts of the graphics look like they were taken out of a video game. The battles also look fake because they are over done with graphics and it really looks ugly. Steppenwolf is a very generic villain, looks too computerized and isn't built well at all. The dialogue is horrendous sometimes. Some of the humor (mostly from Flash) works but the other moment's fall so flat. In contrast to BVS, Ben Affleck looked like he was just going through the motions.<br/><br/>The film had a shorter running length than expected but it still felt too long. The exposition of some characters feels wasted at times, and other times you feel like they spend the wrong moments trying to just throw the characters in. It could have used much better writing. There were times were I was bored out of my mind. The action scenes are fairly grand but nothing epic (compare that to what we get in Thor: Ragnarok). I really back Snyder leaving the DCEU because this is a straight second misfire for him. It's unfortunate to say I have no interest in any film in this Universe aside from Wonder Woman 2.<br/><br/>5/10"

Sure, the whole ""I've come to destroy the world"" plot is way overused, but I think the movie does an alright job of showing the reason why he came to Earth.<br/><br/>The CG was awful in some parts of the movie, but honestly if you're in the theater for the first time you're not going to notice it that much, only on further viewings and maybe once the movie comes to Blu-Ray you'll notice it more."
"clymore","7","5","13","26 November 2017"," Not great, not terrible. Its neither a 1-Star movie, nor a 10 Star
","First of all: Batman vs Superman was not the best start in the franchise, but it also wasn't as bad as many state. Its kinda trendy to hate on the movie, and i feel like the same happens for ""Justice League"". Both Movies are not excellent, like the dark knight (dc) or winter soldier (marvel), but they are both above average, while ""Justice League"" is the better of the two.<br/><br/><ul><li>The Following contain SPOILERS - </li></ul><br/><br/>The movie is entertaining. It lightens up the atmosphere or BvS a little, so there are some jokes in it mainly with Barry Allen/The Flash. And most of them a funny. But its still not as funny as most marvel movies. Its still dark and is a good contrast to for example ""thor: ragnarok"" which was more of a comedy with action scenes and not very serious.<br/><br/>Most characters work really well:<br/><br/>Batman: I still like Afflecs Batman. A lot of people hated on him in BvS because ""he isn't acting like batman"". But most of the people who do that just have no idea.. and there is a time in the comics where Batman is acting exactly like Afflecs Batman. People forget that this version of Batman is not like just in business like the Batman in the Nolan Trilogy. He is batman for 20 years. He saw his Sidekick in Robin killed by the joker and so on.. so its completely understandable that he got a little ""fucked up"" and more serious and darker.. His performance in justice league was good again. Nothing to criticize here.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman: She just works. She just looks stunning in every seen, and you cant turn your eyes away from her. Her fighting scenes look very good and the character got some depth.<br/><br/>Superman: Obviously he doesn't stay dead the whole movie. But who thought he would? He appears in the last third of the movie and i think he performance was good. But I'm just not a big fan of Superman over all, so i mb would have liked the movie more without him.<br/><br/>now to the new guys: Aquaman: for me he is the character with the most problems. I mean, Jason Mamoa is great and he looks awesome and stylish. But he lacks any backstory.. he is just there.. I felt he was kinda disconnected, and he would have needed a little more screen time for his backstory.<br/><br/>The Flash: He is the guy who basically lightens up the mood with some jokes from time to time. I think he was kinda believable. The only thing i didn't like was that its not sure how long he is the flash already. He says things like: ""i never fight, basically i just push people and run away"". That hints that he is the flash not for very long. But he already has a ""base"" and a full costume out of high tech materials which speaks against that.. Otherwise he fit in well and i liked his character.<br/><br/>Cyborg: He was basically the most important of the 3 new members, because he is connected to the ""motherboxes"". He didn't get much backstory either, but he worked for me. But i would have liked a little more screen time for him where we see what he can do, and what he cant do, which wasn't fleshed out enough for me.. kinda like ""vision"" in Age of Ultron, but not as much i think.<br/><br/>The Villains: Steppenwolf was neither a terrible villain, nor a really good one. He looked good for me and at least until Super Man arrives he looked dangerous and strong. Of course his background was not fleshed out very well. Also he mentions the name ""darkside"", but nothing else is mentioned above his connection to darkside. Also for me at least it was not 100% clear who exactly he was talking to when he talked to ""mother"". Did he talk to the boxes? Or is ""mother"" a real ""person""?<br/><br/>He was pretty generic, like most comic book movie villains until now, but nothing too bad.<br/><br/>Overall i enjoyed the movie even if it has flaws. <br/><br/>And i think all those 1-Star ratings are from hatetrain people who already hated on BvS too much..<br/><br/>But its not a 10-Star movie either."

"rolando19552001","9","5","13","16 November 2017"," Justice League
","Justice League <br/><br/>The film is short, not even two hours long, it is swift, a straightforward plot, simple but interesting and easy to follow. The writing is smart, you could guess which scenes Wheedon added as there are many engagements between the super heroes, Batman with Wonder Woman, when Bruce Wayne wants to see the best of Wonder Woman, that she is an icon, and that she must be like Superman was, a symbol of the world, hope. This is particularly a powerful scene, it is a wake up call that simple matters and only the same effort would not do in this coming fight against Steppenwolf. Wonder Woman or Diana gets visibly upset, angry at Bruce Wayne, who begins a harangue, almost a diatribe against Diana about the sacrifices that must be done to protect the world, and that running away from the world does not fix things. Diana reacts hurt and angry at this seemingly betrayal and personal attack, but as Diana is sullen, she learns to forgive Bruce Wayne and forgive herself from the tragedy in Wonder Woman film, Diana is like Superman and the other heroes, she is a good person, who wants to serve others and help others. Bruce Wayne a cynic and a misanthrope in BvS, now there is a change of heart in him, his actions, his way of handling himself, his decisions and it is refreshing to see this transformation in Batman, who clearly feels guilty and sorry for what he had done in BvS, and how he treated Superman. And this dynamic of forgiveness is particularly powerful in Justice League, to forgive others and oneself from the mistakes that you do, Diana has to forgive herself from what happened to her lover in Wonder Woman film, Batman has to forgive himself from what he did to Superman BvS, Clark Kent has to forgive himself from what he did to his lover, Lois Lane, a luscious and lachrymose Amy Adams, that you can see how Lois Lane suffers, her eyes are tearful, when Martha Kent tells her about Clark Kent and they talked about the gone but not forgotten Clark, you could see the sadness that lingers after a loved one goes away, powerful and thoughtful moments that show how the loved ones truly never go away, always in the hearts and the memories of those who loved them and Martha Kent and Lois Lane do love Clark Kent and Superman and one of the best transformation in the DC extended universe is the transformation of Bruce Wayne, Batman, who saw how ugly he was in BvS and now repents, truly guilty and sorry for all the pain he caused, and Batman is one of the new people who learns to love and highly esteemed Clark Kent and thus Superman. Batman who will not let Clark Kent live or die, Batman knows that they cannot stop Steppenwolf without Superman, they are no match for Darkseid general who is exiled and ostracized by his first retreat in the battle between the Apocalips General, the ender of worlds who was kneel in retreat and defeat in the battle for earth, in the age of heroes, when the older tribes of men, they seemed quite Celtic, the Atlanteans and the powerful and defiant and resilient Amazons along with the old gods, even Zeus is seemed in the powerful battle, and the general of Darkseid is vanquished and humiliated to be exiled and try to win his grace among Darkseid again. The CGI seemed a bit perplexing, but it is not bad, the battles scenes are good, especially the battle between the Amazons lead by Queen of Hippolita, a very brave queen that fights against the coming invasion, Steppenwolf wants to get the three mother boxes who combined become the destroyer and ender of worlds, and destroys all living beings in the planet that devours and the living become the para-demons who obeyed Darkseid and Steppenwolf, they can smell fear and destroys everything that feels fear and terror, even their own general if the fear engulfs him. Aquaman and Flash are okay, they are not fully developed, although Flash seemed to have more screen time, Cyborg has a very big important part to do in the mother boxes as when Steppenwolf meets him and finds that Cyborg is a creature of the mother boxes, a creature of chaos, the general says, as Cyborg finds a way to avert the Apocalips with the inside information but they need what Steppenwolf fears the Kryptonian, who like everyone knows Superman is going back to fight and bring hope to the world and is indeed true that the Kryptonian is the glue and the most powerful member of the Justice League, along with Batman and Wonder Woman, who the three become the Trinity. If you are a DC fan you will love the film, but if you are not a DC fan, let me tell you that this is a popcorn film, it is fun and joyful, it has great action, DC has better action than Marvel films, except the only great action Marvel film, The Winter Soldier. If you like a good action, fun film, you will like Justice League, which is about forgiveness, truth, family and of course like Superman says, he is a fan of justice. 9 of 10, good film, fun, great action, great character interaction of super heroes."

Jokes are good, the story is good enough to keep me watching, the action scenes are done pretty good too. The star of the movie is definitely The Flash. Those who compare him to Lex Luthor in BvS are being mean for no reason. The guy made this film work! Again, the weakest link in this universe is Wonder Woman, that is Gal Gadot. Her acting and accent got better for this movie, but are still not at a level they should be to justify a major role in a big budget film (IMHO). Also, it seemed that the women in this movie are either an excuse for the men to talk about their feelings and not look weak, or to be a love interest. But that is just me nitpicking. Watching it in the cinema is a must to get the full experience, because the 3D is done really good. I really enjoyed it! Fun movie!"

Because nothing can compare to those days you spent in front of a TV as a kid, watching JL. But they came very close to it. It's an action packed story about putting together the most famous superhero team in the world, from getting to know each other, to working together to save the world.

Something must be said, people must be warned. Something has to be done to stop those responsible and they have to be held accountable and tried for their crimes.<br/><br/>At this stage it doesn't seem right critiquing DC's tired efforts of pulling of a cinematic universe. It's like making fun of a kid that just keeps on falling down flat on his face, at this point one really has to sympathize. So many millions, so many eggs in one basket...Hey who's excited about Aquaman: The Movie? The execs at Warner Bros sure hope you do! Remember when movies had a heart at its core? When they made you feel emotionally invested in characters and the choices they made? You felt there was something at stake, something to be lost, a sense of thrill and danger? I don't think this is asking too much of our movies cause these are the bare minimum of what a film requires. However today that might be asking too much.<br/><br/>The ironic thing is, the Justice League cartoon, that used to air on Cartoon Network which was essentially aimed at children, met ALL of those requirements and so much more. The characters and world they inhabited were dealt with seriousness and explored in depth. So why does the movie supposedly aimed at adults treat the material so childishly, presenting the shallowest possible versions of the characters? With low brow humor like Flash asking Batman what his super power is, to which he responds ""I'm rich."" Sure it's cute and gets a chuckle, but interestingly enough something so juvenile wouldn't be found in the Justice League cartoon series, aimed at children."

The movies tries too hard to be a Marvel-comedy movie almost as it tried with being a dark movie.<br/><br/>To be fair, I can care less if a DC movie wants to be dark or a comedy, I have nothing against with whatever tone a DC movie wants, but the way the DC movies TRY to express the tone is the problem, It's not that DC movies are TOO Dark or comedic, it's that they're TERRIBLE at being dark and comedic. And it was done in a way that it ruins characters like Batman, Superman, and Flash. Because of BVS's way of being ""dark"" Batman just feels like a dangerous criminal other than a crime- fighter because he was portrayed as that. First we see Batman torture some man, frighten a bunch of citizens and police officers that see him as ""the devil"" than now we see him try to kill Superman, than suddenly change because Superman's Mommy. Wow, definitely the Batman I have seen before... Now how does the ""comedy"" work out in Justice League? Well, some parts in the movie did give me a few laughs, but the comedy whether funny or not, just doesn't work and it feels forced in the movie just as much as how dark was forced in BVS. The tone no matter what has to just be put into DCEU films that don't progress in the story, Flash is my biggest problem of this situation, He is just focused heavily on being a comic relief that his backstory and character doesn't work, seeing Flash talk to his dad in prison felt nothing to me because it didn't feel like this was a conflict between Barry and his father, I watched the CW Flash TV series and when I saw those characters in the same place, I actually felt something because it was actually something that Barry wanted to take care of, he wants to take his father out of prison, and most of the time Barry just cries to him every time he meets him because that's how much he misses him. For the JL, it's just starting with Batman saying ""Hey, here's Barry's backstory"" then we see Barry talking to his dad like ""Hey Dad how's it going"" type of stuff. Lets also say Flash just has no personality outside the fact he's always just confused and whatever. He wasn't funny, and even if he was, he still wouldn't work as a character like Flash from other TV Shows. People try to say Thor 3 has the worst comedy in attempts to defend the JL, Thor 3 was one of the funniest movies I've seen in theaters. And yes, I enjoy Marvel Movies, even though I am a big fan of DC Comic while I just don't really care for Marvel.<br/><br/>2. The formation of the Justice League was lazy.<br/><br/>So how does the JL form as a team? Easy, just get help from some other superheroes to fight a CGI villain that wants to take over the world. Than just become friends because um, we helped defeat a superhero. Bravo writing, way to really start the DC Extended Universe with all the beloved characters come together. I haven't really seen the Avengers, but I'm pretty sure for god that the characters had more to them than just superheroes who want to destroy Loki.<br/><br/>3. Bruce and Clark's instant relationship now just pisses me off about the Martha scene even more.<br/><br/>Okay, to be fair, I know what the BVS fans are getting from when they defend the scene, and most of the time the people who hate the Martha scene often use nitpicks to argue with the defenders like ""Why doesn't he just say ""mother"""" or ""Why not be specific other than ""find him"""" Here's my reason why I hate the Martha scene, I despise the scene because it forced the character development between Bruce and Clark. It's not just the fact that they stopped fighting, but then they instantly become buddies, why? After Bruce tried to kill Clark and doing it for reasons that are just offensive to Superman, They just then instantly become friends ignoring the stupid things Bruce was doing to Clark. And that was my main problem with Justice League, Bruce speaks of Clark's death like he was his friend ever since they were children. And it even forces its lines in the movie that tries to prove a point for the defenders on the Martha scene, YES, WE KNOW BATMAN WAS REALIZING WHAT HE DID WRONG TO SUPERMAN BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN ITS STILL NOT FORCED FOR BOTH OF THEM TO BECOME BEST FRIENDS. Now knowing that this movie did so horrible at box offices, I am starting to become sure the next movies will probably suffer the same then the DCEU will die very soon."
"hiraishinnojutsu","7","5","14","15 November 2017"," A good start towards the right direction for the next DC movies
","At this point, I couldn't care less about what the harshest critics gonna say, as a DC fan, I enjoy watching this movie on the theater very much: great heroes, awesome action scenes, good drama to the point that it almost as magnificent as The Avengers (2012) (which unfortunately, it is not). the resurrection scene was not as good as I had in mind for the Justice League needs to literally bring Superman back to life instead of him waking up all by himself and make an epic entrance (with that iconic John Williams' Superman anthem that is full of hope, which is the meaning of superman's s symbol) while kicking some parademons' asses and saving innocent civilians while they (and the rest of the leaguers) look up to his silhouette in the sky descending slowly and dramatically. The last action scenes felt like it was being rushed without so much view where our heroes massacre thousand upon thousand of parademons while helping the helpless trapped people into safety (like Marvel did in its two previous avengers movies), instead, they just cut to punching and throwing poor Steppenwolf into submission while separating the three mother boxes. what do you expect? it's Zack Snyder, good at action and fight scenes, poor at narratives (I'm honestly glad he won't be back for the next dc movies. hope they'll find a better director for JL 2, 3, 4, etc). Regardless the flaws, this movie shows a really fine improvement for DC movies in general and make fans wanting some more, giving the DC Cinematic Universe a very bright future like they never experience before. the tone of this movie makes me set a pretty high expectation for the next DCEU projects (which sadly only come out once by the end of the next year: Aquaman solo movie) and I'm pretty sure it won't end in disappointment. Fingers crossed!!!"

","I've watched Justice League last night as I could hardly wait to see my two best favorite heroes back in action.Â <br/><br/>I was bit worry that the movie turned out to be disappointing due some reviews I read online. The critics were really mean. Man! They just could't help their selves but sliced and chopped the movie into pieces and left it dried out of its juicy parts.<br/><br/>My suggestion for my fellow movie-goers, don't read the review unless you've seen the movie or they'll eat your positive energy with their mean and brutal reviews. It'll force you to see the movie as a comparable stuff.<br/><br/>For me, the movie was good but not perfect, obviously. The tone was lighter than BvS, and that's a good sign. Not that I'm complaining with BvS movie tone but I believe some, if not most, movie-goers think that the tone was too dark.<br/><br/>The cast were good and team were tried to get along each other in quite funny way. Although, there were some moments I felt the jokes were dry as I have seen them during the trailer. When Barry Allen ask Bruce Wayne what he's super power was, and Bruce replied, ""I'm rich."" It could've been funnier if I haven't seen it in the trailer.<br/><br/>Of course as a critic, I would say that they could have done better with the story line and tied some loose ends, but the movie just doing fine if you watch them with an unprejudiced soul. You are watching a movie, not a score board. So, just enjoy."

","So my first review on IMDB comes because this movie is such a waste of time and money. The director had access to great graphic engines and nothing else. They forgot the book on imagination. That too sucks because they probably used some video game people to do the bad graphic work. My PS4 has better graphics.. and stories.<br/><br/>The plot is so basic that you could have predicted it within the first few minutes. 
The actors are doing a terrible job at acting all through the movie. The Villain is s so horrible, that he seems like an afterthought to the casting process. So they end up with just CGI.<br/><br/>Special Mention to Gal Gadot. She is the Katrina Kaif (Bollywood people will know this) of Hollywood. All through the movie she is posing like its a photoshoot. Does a pathetic job at playing the role, or even look like WW (yes, costume alone isnt enough). To top it off, she cannot act!<br/><br/>All in all Alfred and the props did the best acting in the movie."

"meganismegan","10","3","7","20 November 2017"," Very Fun
","I liked the movie.<br/><br/>It was a lot of fun. It wasn't just quips and Steppenwolff seemed like a real threat to the heroes.<br/><br/>Each member of the team had their moments, and they all felt important to the story and to the mission, and I loved the stuff with Superman. When he showed up in the final fight, it was kind of like when the school bully is picking on the kids (the Justice League), and then the older brother of one of the bullied kids shows up and is a bigger bad ass than the villain.<br/><br/>Flash was funny, and I laughed at the Lasso of Truth stuff with Aquaman. I loved when Flash first saw the Batcave.<br/><br/>Affleck is still a great Batman, and Gal Gadot was the perfect choice for Diana. <br/><br/>I'm glad Cyborg wasn't a goofball like in the Teen Titans Go comic. In the 80s New Teen Titans books (glad my brother is a comic geek with a huge collection, those stories are a great read), Victor wasn't a jokey goof, he had layers, and it looks like they went this direction with the movie version, and I hope to see more of him.<br/><br/>I felt like this movie had the same issue the Avengers movie had. In terms of story it's pretty basic. Big threat, needs a team to stop it, team fights (except this time the team actually fights the main villain), saves the day. The difference is they didn't make the villain a joke telling robot or a Daddy's boy like Avengers 1 and 2.<br/><br/>I appreciate that the jokes weren't the big focus of the film. I hate comedies, and a joke here or there in a movie is good, but when the movie is just jokes with the rest of the stuff feeling like the side focus, it dumbs down movies. It's why I walked out an hour into Thor: Ragnarok. I waited out in the car while my boyfriend watched the rest.<br/><br/>This movie was good. I had fun watching it. Great to get to see Gal Gadot in two movies in one year as Wonder Woman. Diana's awesome.<br/><br/>One scene in particular I want to make a wallpaper for my laptop for is the look on Barry's face when Superman looks at him while he's running at Super Speed. Cracked me up.<br/><br/>I rate movies based off how much enjoyment I had watching them. So since I had fun watching this, I give it a 10. Action 10. Story 5 (like I said, team up movies can only have basic plots because they're trying to give everyone screen time so the focus gets a bit straightforward). Characters 10"
"ivan_tobias","9","3","7","19 November 2017"," Very enjoyable and a great addition to the growing collection of DC movies
","I went to see Thor Ragnarok with my wife yesterday which we then followed by Justice League and boy I am glad I stayed in the cinema for Justice League. <br/><br/>Although I have never read a single comic I am a big fan of these kinds of movies as much as of any good sci-fi and this is what I think.<br/><br/>Thor Ragnarok was over-hyped. It completely failed to bring any meaning or continuation of the story of Thor that was in line with all Avengers movies. It turned the once mighty god/alien being with snappy witty comments yet serious and important stance into a stupid moron with overly large ego who has no sense of danger or urgency. While Avengers combined the seriousness of the Winter Soldier and the wittiness of Iron Man, it did so based around the story with meaningful characters with real feelings and personal struggles and great team chemistry. This was even more apparent in the Guardians of the Galaxy that introduced an unlikely team of heroes with seemingly nothing in common that against all odds unites them and you feel for them. The comedy is then part of their quirks and personalities as well as situations but it is never overarching the threat of danger or urgency. Thor, on the other hand, was a collection of silly one-liners, a crap team without any chemistry and absolutely no sense of danger. Also, there was no feel for his world or people. At no point I cared about who his people are or why should they be saved or spared. They were just so disposable. Then there was the once menacing strong Hulk turned into a stroppy retarded babe, terrible Jeff Goldblum being Jeff Goldblum and the out-of-place appearance of Banner and Dr. Strange. <br/><br/>Thor was sort of fun but disappointing, disposable and a forgettable movie that undermined the threat Avengers are going to face.<br/><br/>Then we continued with Justice League which was a completely different story. I don't know whether it was the fact that it was made by Zach Snyder and director of the Avengers but this was in a different league. This was from the very first minute a grown-up movie. The story was great, the chemistry of the team was awesome. They felt like a new team, full of contrast and disagreements. The humour was spot on and mostly it was situational rather than forced. A lot of times thing were funny just through imagery rather than silly one-liners like in Thor, just as when Flash noticed that Superman can see him or the fact that Batman took ages to catch up with them because he has no superpowers. I loved the fact that they addressed the relationship with the mother or that Batman is getting old, or that Flash is inexperienced. I loved the fact that until the end I did not know whether Superman would actually step in and help them and showing the family in danger made me feel like the threat was actually real. Or about the fact that they addressed the elephant in the room that Wonder Woman is gorgeous and manipulated everyone with her charm (as it was the case with Cyborg). Overall, this was a better movie that perfectly fits in with the previous DC movies. Honestly, seeing the reviews before we saw the movies I felt like Thor would be better, that it would be like Avengers or the Winter Soldier combined with Guardians of the Galaxy, it failed to deliver. On the other hand, JL positively surprised and my wife who is not really into these kinds of movies said: ""Should we go and see it tomorrow again?"""

","What you expect from a film ?? Entertainment ?? Of course!! Justice league keeps you engaged till the very end And it has enough ingredients to keep your interest alive. So here is the story line -- Batman is gathering a team of meta-humans with the help of Wonder Woman to save the world from the wrath of an ancient Villain called Steppen Wolf. He is searching for mother boxes ,the most powerful energy sources in existence, in order to Dominate the world. There is flash , there is Batman , Wonder woman , Aquaman and Cyborg Of course! And then there is Superman in a long special appearance. Performances: Ben Affleck as the Batman is first rate , Gal Gadot is the real show stealer here , she's outstanding in every frame. Ezra Miller is quite funny and he has given some good lines to deliver. Jason Mamoa and Ray fisher are good enough. Direction by Zack Snyder could've been more better,his Narrative style is so simple and there is no twist and turns in the plot. Editing is fine , could've been crispier. Dialogues are quirky and one liners are well written. Action scenes are thrilling and there are two major Combat sequences one is in the first half and the other One in climax and they both standout. All in the whole JL is a treat for DC fans and for me also. Don't miss it , it's better than BvS and you'll surely have fun. My rating :7 /10"

","Batman (Ben Affleck) gathers together Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), the Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) to battle Steppenwolf (CGI). He's a being from Darkseid to get three boxes on Earth to get total control.<br/><br/>Quick (only 2 hours), fast and basically lots of fun. After the disaster that was ""Batman vs. Superman"" I expected the worst but was pleasantly surprised. There's plenty of action and carton-like violence but no blood or gore. The plot is easy to understand and there's welcome doses of humor. There's also great acting by Affleck and Gadot. However there are minuses. Fisher is blank as Cyborg. Miller is neither cute nor charming--just annoying. Also turning Aquaman into a bad-ass was a spectacularly stupid idea. Also Amy Adams (as Lois Lane) and Diane Lane (as Ma Kent) were woefully underused. Still I loved the movie. Also, as always, wait for a cool little sequence after the closing credits."

","First things First. This is better than The AVENGERS, Age Of Ulrtron and Civil War put together.

The fights are great e.g the scene when Steppenwolf enters was absolutely Brilliant. The story is good. The setup really has a feel of new group forming and the perks that come with it, the differences of opinion that come with it, the clashes that happen and then comes the team spirit.<br/><br/>I thought that Superman was a little less portrayed, but still every scene that he is in is fantastic. Which is why I think the film should have been longer. I think the original film was actually longer but for some reason the studios cut it down. I am certainly hoping for an extended cut of the film when it comes in Blu-ray.<br/><br/>It is a fantastic film and I think a must watch in the IMAX format."

","For those of us to whom the acronym JLA has been enshrined since the 1960s, dropping of ""America"", if for political correctness (to avoid sounding too self-important), seems absurd. I shall therefore continue to use JLA.<br/><br/>A fan of the original JLA comics in the 1960s, I can't help but feel a tinge of disappointment that 2.5 of the original 7 members are missing in this ultimate motion picture realization. Green Lantern I miss most as he was my top favorite JLA hero. Ryan Reynold's 2011 version failed to fulfill this comic hero's potentials, although the star himself found greener pasture as Deadpool (2016). Not seeing the Martian Manhunter is not a surprise as this character never had his own place but only appeared as an occasional independent story in Superman comics. And it was a delightful surprise when I saw him in the TV series ""Supergirl"", ably portrayed by David Harewood.<br/><br/>The ""half"" missing is Superman. All promotional material seems designed to create the impression that he will be no more, consistent with his death at the end of ""Batman v Superman"" (2016). But he is resurrected approaching the last third of the movie here, and has some touching scenes with Lois Lane (a wonderful Amy Adams) and one brief moment with Martha (an equally wonderful Diane Lane), before finally joining the JLA to complete the group.<br/><br/>Superman aside, 4 of the original 7 made it to this first official JLA movie: Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman. Add to make a fifth is Cyborg, who in the original comics joined very late in the game (like, a few decades).<br/><br/>In addition to his appearance in ""BvS"", which many think is Ben Affleck's only portrayal of Batman hitherto, he also had a blink-and-you'll-miss cameo, uncredited, in ""Suicide Squad"" (2016). Gal Gadot, after a brief appearance in ""BvS"", has conclusively proved her worth in her own launch of ""Wonder Woman"". For those who have followed three seasons of Grant Gustin in the TV series, Ezra Miller as movie version of The Flash takes a bit of getting used to. Just like Affleck, Miller appeared in the same 2 movies in preceding for JLA. Unlike Affleck, both Miller's appearances are brief cameos. Portraying Aquaman, Jason Momoa is best known to the world as Drogo the Dothraki, in ""Game of Thrones"". Both the character Cyborg and his screen representation Ray Fisher are new comers. So much for background.<br/><br/>For plot line of superhero comic movies, there is really not much to talk about. Justice will always triumph over evil. It is therefore more of the journey than the destination. The villain here is one Steppenwolf, one-dimensional, played by veteran character actor Ciaran Hinds, motion-captured, with two third of his face behind a helmet-mask, a complete waste of talents. While currently most noted as the wildlings king-beyond-the-wall Mance Rayder in Game of Thrones, Hind's most vivid screen image is the Russian president in ""The sum of all fears"" (2002).<br/><br/>The special effect and action sequences here are neither particularly bad nor particularly good. The delightful surprise is that I was plunged into nostalgia, twice. Watching the evil ""flying vampires"", I had a sudden vision that I was watching ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) – the Wicked Witch's army of flying monkeys. Then, as Aquaman held off the onslaught of a crushing wall of waves to allow the others to get away, it was Moses parting the Red Sea again in ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956) all over again.<br/><br/>As in any such ensemble movie, there is never enough time to develop all the characters. Director Zack Snyder has done a reasonable job. If I were to describe the 5 main characters each with just one word, they would be – macho, juvenile, mellowed, damaged and motherly.<br/><br/>The three new heroes each come with a different story. Those who have followed the aforementioned TV series of The Flash are all too familiar with Barry Allen's quest of trying to exonerate his father who is in jail. This unhappy burden aside, The Flash provides comic relief in the group with his juvenile enthusiasm and awkwardness, in very much the same way Spiderman does in the Avengers ""Civil War"". Miller capably fulfills this role as written. If you are familiar with the character RoboCop (there have been several movies), you understand Cyborg, someone that is all but destroyed physically brought back to a human-cum-machine existence. As the greenest on the cast, Fisher holds his own in portraying this persona struggling to live with a new identity of damaged-and-repaired body. Joining the JLA will helps Cyborg in this difficult journey. With an appearance quite unlike the portrayal in the original comic, Aquaman comes across as a macho he-man, but one with common sense as well as an occasional sense of humor. He prefers low-profile obscurity of a desolate location where he helps the small folks. There is one ""speech"" however, that he makes in an unguarded moment when he opens up. Don't miss Momoa's excellent delivery of this speech, when takes place when the five of them are debating the way forward.<br/><br/>While not as dark as Christian Bale's, Affleck's Batman is greying and mellowing. With fire in him still, Batman has to struggle with his personal issue, the perceived guilt of causing Superman's death. While on Batman, it should be mentioned that Jeremy Iron continues to admirably execute a role made so endearing by Michael Caine. And if there is a contest of a superhero with most smiles, Wonder Woman would win hands down. Gadot, after the acclaimed success of delivering Wonder Woman's own franchise, continues to bring unique charm to the big screen. The smiles here, interestingly, are more maternal than anything else in nature. While The Flash is the only adolescent in the bunch, they all have a bit of innate adolescence. When little kids squabble, it's the mother that restores order."

","Just watched the JUSTICE LEAGUE movie, reached home and writing my honest reviews.....<br/><br/>Whatever the critics are saying, simply don't go by what they are saying!! Go for yourself to see how good the JUSTICE LEAGUE movie is. It is not perfect but than it is not at all that horrible and bad that these so called ""Critics"" and sites/blogs are rating. I mean there are moments when Superman comes back and people just stood up from their seats and started applauding and so much more. <br/><br/>If the latest Thor Movie (Thor:Ragnarok) can get so much good ratings and good reviews from critics i really wonder what went wrong with critics to rate so low scores to JUSTICE LEAGUE. I mean come-on! JUSTICE LEAGUE is not a perfect movie either but it seriously does not deserves only 2 STARS out of 5 or such a low ratings. I mean seriously....!<br/><br/>I my opinion Thor:Ragnarok was nothing but a comedy movie. I know I know many would argue but it doesn't come close to my favorite 3 Marvel movies which i mentioned down in the end.<br/><br/>There is surely and surely some serious issues with critics that went to watch JUSTICE LEAGUE like -><br/><br/><ul><li>they had hangover of previous night and it was still hammering their head, </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>or they are here to bash movies directed by Zack Snyder,</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>or they think that DC movies too must have comic dialogues right after every 2 Mins.

","Snyder does wonders with visuals again! Whatever scenes that were his contribution has left me wowed. Jokes and one liners by Joss is a welcome change and surprising too. Though it feels bad the studio cut out many scenes, it did provide that feel of watching JL animated movies which are fast paced and 'flash'es through scenarios with humour and action. Even with minor flaws, JL did in 2 hours what their animated movies does in 1 hour.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the heroes is really a delight to watch. Die hard fans of these characters will definitely go crazy when they spring into action. We see something brewing in between Bruce & Diana.Every hero has their moments in the movie but particularly Aquaman, Flash and the goddamn SUPERMAN steals the show! Keeping superman away from all the trailers was a good move from WB's side. Superman proves that he is the alpha & omega of superheroes.<br/><br/>Music by Danny Elfman is fitting for the movie. I liked it when he threw in the classic batman and superman themes. Cinematography by Fabian Wagner is a treat to the eyes. VFX was top notch for most of the movie and went downhill at a few places. VFX during flash's running and scenes in Atlantis were some of the best. Steppenwolf CGI didn't look that bad to be honest. He's good for an ugly alien from some godforsaken planet.😜<br/><br/>The movie doesn't have a complex plot as compared to BvS. Steppenwolf is the usual CBM villain. Instead of turning him into a bad-ass villain, the makers just made him the reason for the league to come together so they can be ready for the big baddie.<br/><br/>Even after a director change, Henry's mustache issue, re-shoots, pressure of meeting audience expectations, the studio managed to deliver us the first live action Justice League that is nothing short of an epic superhero entertainer. Forget all the bullshit surrounding the movie, just sit back & enjoy. I'm definitely going for a second watch 😍"
"edhuang-toronto","8","3","7","16 November 2017"," Better than the paid reviews say
","Bottom line, it's a pretty solid and fun movie. <br/><br/>No, it doesn't have Hulk penis jokes and 10 year old level comedy. DC takes more pure themes about superheroes and actually shows them being heroes, not just quip-machines.<br/><br/>One thing that stands out is Snyder's shots are still amazing to see. There are probably 5-10 cinematic shots in the first 10 minutes alone that show artistry over other comparable hero franchises. Story was pared down due to the need to introduce new characters, but everyone seemed to get enough time to establish themselves in proper form. <br/><br/>Acting was solid all around. They didn't pollute the characters will fake angst or conflict as it felt fairly natural in the context of the story. <br/><br/>Definitely a strong hero movie overall."

","Midnight showing!<br/><br/>Being a superhero fan, I was super excited for this. Batman, superman, wonder woman, flash, cyborg and aquaman all together.<br/><br/>So my rating is 8 <br/><br/>My overall thoughts is that it was great seeing the build up of these new characters and the build up of them coming together. The villain was fierce and powerful which gave the heroes a true test. The action and visuals were amazing. Humour was well placed. And superman ... wow <br/><br/>Pros: Action, plenty of surprises, Visuals, The Flash was fun and had a great personality as well as great moments, Steppenwolf, the slightly lighter toned parts yet still had dark moments as DC is known for. Henry Cavill delivering a new superman which was fantastic And the post credit scenes was an opening to new ideas for the cinematic universe. The soundtrack suited really well even though I was worried that it wasn't Hans Zimmer or XL.<br/><br/>Cons: I wouldn't say it was a major one but unfortunately I spotted the CGI used for Henry Cavill due to reshoots and schedules. Aquaman felt slightly under used however I believe this is so that we see way way more in his solo film. <br/><br/>The film kept me engaged through out, I wanted to know more and more about each character and every battle showed what DC are great at... pure entertainment.<br/><br/>As a superhero fan (both Marvel and DC) this was a amazing watch and I shall indeed go see it again and again! <br/><br/>Hope all you DC and hero fans enjoy it like I did!"

","Lets face it, the DCEU has had some iffy moments so far. Some great things have been in their movies but the overall movies have been disjointed, unsatisfying or leave the audiences wishing for more of the things that worked and less of the things that didn't. Wonder Woman turned the tide and now Justice league has shown that there is a future there.<br/><br/>The main characters are all well developed here. Some get more screen time than others but every one of them brings something different to the movie and the little bits they bring meld together well. Their interactions in pairs or together are all done well and in some cases you are left wishing for more.<br/><br/>Things feel rushed in places but this is as a result of the studio insisting on a 2 hour running time. Ironically a longer run time here might have helped but it is what it is.<br/><br/>The action scenes are impressive and enjoyable and we get some cool visuals.<br/><br/>The villain Steppenwolf is pretty one dimensional and he lacks menace. He is voiced well but he's pretty uninteresting but I've decided that it's not such a bad thing - for these individuals to come together they needed a world threat to put aside difference and the way the Motherboxes are used to bring them all together worked for me. Now that the team have been established a more interesting villain or villains can come in.<br/><br/>WATCH THE POST CREDITS SCENE - I promise it seems worth it and it hints where future movies might go. If they go in that direction for a future movie, I for one would far prefer it to another alien invasion story (save that for the third film.<br/><br/>This is not a perfect movie but it is massively enjoyable and long time fans will get a few nods to previous movies and comic books which will make them smile."

","Justice League is not the movie that fans want. That is why it is not successful. Because studios are making these type of movies for make fans happy. But if we are talking about DCEU, no one is happy at all. Introducing of characters is bad. Actually we dont know anything about anyone. CGIs look so fake, sometimes it looks like a video game. Villian is simple and cliche, he hasnt got a motivation. On the other side, I liked Bruce's effort and motivation about putting this team together. Wonder Woman is wonderful again. Flash is funny, Aquaman is cool, Cyborg is complicated, Superman has a small part... But if I put aside everything, after credits scenes are giving me hope for future, both of them."

","Saw the movie few days back. Can't say i was surprised or astonished but was pretty happy from what i saw and am gonna see it at least 2 more times in this week. I wonder what is this all hate about? Critics and Marvel fans are going all nuts in saying all type of rubbish against this movie.<br/><br/>I am a DC and Marvel fan. Enjoy all movies. But question is, have you seen Guardians of Galaxy Vol 2? Or Spiderman Homecoming? They are what a total rubbish looks like. But well, they are either watched by complete retards (no offense) or only by those who made the movies and gave all the high scores and credibility. <br/><br/>This movie was fun, action packed and with all the cinematic scenes that portray the DC heroes. Stunning shots are all around the movie. <br/><br/>I believe movie could have been easily more than what it is at the moment. Predictability is there. I agree but kept its ground and it did right on too many grounds. <br/><br/>It presented us the best Superman so far. The one all comic fans wants to see. Solid and strong. Straight on the matters. Aquaman was kind of a let down with no special standout capabilities as of a super hero but his acting was awesome. Flash stole the show but way too less knowing of his abilities. Cyborg was on spot. Wonder woman did her part as good as she always does. And Batman.. Ah, the grace, the vision and the BAT that we all needed. <br/><br/>All in all, movie was great. Not Awesome maybe but great. Much much much better than what haters are saying about the movie. If i was forced on a gun point to watch Guardians of Galaxy vol 2 and spiderman homecoming for free or watch Justice League at the cost of 10000$, i will watch Justice league even if it bankrupts me."

","Please release the SYDER CUT. #releasethesyndercut"
"Cineanalyst","3","2","4","29 September 2019"," Franken-Justice
","After rewatching ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) and this, ""Justice League,"" it seems that Joss Whedon, who co-wrote and reassembled this, along with being one of the main creative forces behind the former MCU installment, managed to rework Mary Shelley's book ""Frankenstein"" into the two biggest comic-book superhero movie franchises. Unfortunately, they're both among the most flawed entries in those respective shared cinematic universes, but it's an interesting similarity nonetheless. It's as though he wasn't content with his stitching together of the horror genre and superhero fare for the MCU sequel, or thought that Lex Luther raising a Kryptonian blood-brother of himself from the grave in the form of Doomsday in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016) wasn't enough of an homage to the 1931 film version of ""Frankenstein,"" that he had to try again. Too bad this is the worst monstrosity of Franken-supes yet.<br/><br/>The production mess has been well reported, but the overriding aim was clearly to imitate the success of the lighter tone of the Marvel movies after the mixed record of Zach Snyder's grim visions in ""Man of Steel"" (2013) and, more so, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016). Personally, despite the faults of Snyder's prior two DCEU pictures, I'll take them anyday over ""Justice League;"" at least, then, we have two distinguishable behemoth comic-book franchises instead of an amorphous glut of repetition at the box office. Sure, when the imitation works, an ""Aquaman"" (2018) or ""Shazam!"" (2019) is largely indiscernible from an ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" (2018) or ""Captain Marvel"" (2019), but what's interesting about that. On the flip side, when the temperament is off and the jokes are flat, you get a bomb such as this, and all that's left of any compelling nature, for me at least, is what sort of Frankenstein monster lurks within all that wreckage.<br/><br/>Sadly, even the Frankenstein stuff here is less intriguing and integrated than in Whedon's prior ""Age of Ultron,"" where the entirety of the superhero team and their antagonist were part of the creation process and the monstrosities within the story. There were mad doctors (Tony Stark, Bruce Bannon, Ultron's manipulated scientist), monsters (Hulk, a Jekyll/Hyde type character, most obviously, as well as a (scarlet) witch and the AI robots) and even a god (Thor) to provide the spark of life. The mixture of magic and science fiction and, to a lesser extent, that of the horror and superhero genres worked. DC has its alien god, too, which was part of the appeal of Snyder's pictures, although Superman as a Christ figure had been a theme mined since Christopher Reeve put on the cape and tights. That's absent here, as Supes doesn't interact with regular people at all outside of an opening smart-phone interview by off-screen kids and his carrying an apartment building that presumably contains humans. Nope, here, he's merely an overpowered deus ex machina who's a bit confused at first, but then is just happy to be alive and save the day almost effortlessly. Batman and Alfred have the computers and tech savvy, but not along the lines of their MCU counterparts, and Cyborg seems to be content merely to hack into such gizmos and search the web. Meanwhile, Wonder Woman, Flash and Aquaman each have their own personal backstories that the narrative gets into and which have nothing to do with the Frankenstien theme or with anything particularly interesting.<br/><br/>What ""Justice League"" does have is magic. The infinity stones... I mean, mother boxes are employed for both of the movie's two Frankenstein-esque creation/resurrection episodes. Cyborg's dad, perhaps the only true mad scientist here, used one to save his son's life, who was otherwise legally proclaimed dead, and merge him with robotics and computer stuff in the process. The two of them will later discuss which of them is a monster. The same box, then, is made to bring the corpse of Superman back to life. Cyborg and Flash get tasked with digging the body up, too. The resurrection of Jesus Superman is somewhat intriguing--more so than the creation of Abomination Doomsday in the prior picture. Having the body in fluid is somewhat reminiscent of the Hammer Frankenstein films more so than any of the Boris Karloff versions. Moreover, Flash explicitly references ""Pet Sematary,"" for which Stephen King's novel surely owes much to Shelley's work.<br/><br/>Curiouser yet, I don't recall the insides of the Kryptonian ship in the previous movies looking so vaginal. Just look at those corridors to the embryonic chamber. In this sense, Superman's corpse is the egg, of course, along with the ""box,"" which is already slang for vagina. The spark of life--the penis and sperm, if you will, is provided by Flash. He backs up to the end of one of these vaginal canals, then races through it, past the cervix and uterus, to fertilize the magical super egg in the Fallopian tubes with his surging electrical charge. It's one of the more sexually-suggestive Frankenstein-esque creation scenes I've seen since Kenneth Branagh essentially alluded to masturbation in ""Mary Shelley's Frankenstein"" (1994). And, in the Frankenstein tradition, Flash and Superman play out the myth of homunculi--fully formed humans from which fetuses were formerly misbelieved to develop.<br/><br/>It's all downhill from there. The fight between Superman and the rest of the League isn't bad, though, and the speed of Flash allows for the exploration of Superman's quickness, too. Everything else is bad. The CGI vomit that is the bland supervillain (Steppenwolf) and his army of insect clones is excruciatingly generic--proving the usual bloodless warfare for some PG-13 violence. The climactic battle is unexciting, and there's a peculiar focus on a sole family fleeing the carnage. Compare this to the better-integrated fates of civilians in the climax of ""Age of Ultron."" The humor is uniformly flat, including Flash's ""racially-charged"" fist-bump fail with Cyborg, and the running gag about brunch only rings true for middle-to-upper-class filmmakers--an unemployed young university student of poverty like Barry Allen would not be concerned about brunch. His pops is in prison, and he admits to having no friends, so who would he be going to brunch with anyways. At some point, it seems they just ran out of things for characters to say and so resorted to such uncompelling interjections between fight scenes as, ""alright"" and ""booyah."" Sometimes, the superheroes merely line up and pose for a few moments. Even worse are the several gratuitous shots focusing on Gal Gadot's posterior and the low-angle up-skirt shots while she's wearing her revealing Wonder Woman costume. It reminds me of how the MCU introduced Scarlet Johansson as Black Widow back in ""Iron Man 2"" (2010), including a prolonged look at her backside as she walked into a restaurant in one scene. Better MCU installments don't do that. Heck, DCEU's ""Wonder Woman"" (2017) didn't do that. But, hey, this was the DCEU's first attempt at being derivative. There are even scenes during and after the credits that aren't worth watching--one of which sets up another movie that may never happen because this one was so bad."

"Mike_Devine","4","2","4","29 May 2018"," Proving to be the little league of superhero franchises
","After three film entries in the DC Comics universe that found varying degrees of success, Warner Bros. hit a snag with 2017's 'Justice League.' Directed by Zack Snyder, the film brought together the new kids on the block of superheroes in Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Jason Fisher) and everyone's favorite man of steel (Henry Cavill).<br/><br/>While on paper, this all-star cast gives off an 'Avengers' vibe, it's a far cry from that franchise. For one, the actors completely lack chemistry. Everything seems forced, especially the few comedic moments that are thrown into the mix. Sure, 'Justice' is supposed to be more serious in nature than anything in the Marvel universe, but it's possible to strike a balance without coming off so wooden. Even Gadot's Wonder Woman does not radiate the same sense of confidence as she did in her titular role last year.<br/><br/>Aside from the poorer than usual acting, the story is nothing special - the heroes band together to stop the threat posed by New God member Steppenwolf as he tries to collect three powerful boxes that could destroy Earth. This is standard fare for any superhero entry, so it doesn't really count against 'Justice,' nor does it do it any favors. So what does this leave us? Not much, unfortunately. Everything here is pretty much forgettable.<br/><br/>It's possible that DC films can make a comeback, as 'Wonder Woman,' 'Suicide Squad' and 'Man of Steel' all seemed to click with audiences. Hopefully 'Aquaman' can beat the odds in December, otherwise many will blame 'Justice League' for casting a shadow on future releases."

They are in and on Batman's spider machine device when all of a sudden Cyborg just ejects out of the machine, the Flash comments ""Why is he leaving"", then the scene just ends and they are above ground in safety. Huh!? Horrible editing. What's the point of them having a panic escape scene if you are just going to edit it in mid sequence and have them safe?

"gigitville","5","2","4","26 February 2018"," Come On, DC
","Okay, DC is at it again, and unfortunately, they've fallen into their old habits. Justice League falls closer to Batman v Superman than Wonder Woman. I knew better than to get my hopes up too high for this one, though I was a bit hopeful. I loved the trailer's cover of Come Together, and Wonder Woman was great. Maybe Justice League could keep along the same pattern. Well, no such luck. 
The biggest problem was that the entire thing felt rushed. I know Zach Snyder was trying to avoid another long winded and bloated movie, but the fact that DC was getting antsy due to Marvel's success was obvious. The reshoots were also obvious, as well as the clashing tones of Zach Snyder and Joss Whedon. Also, there were some shots or sequences that were taken directly from Avengers, which was sort of funny because it wasn't in a parodying way. In the same vein, the humor (which was most likely Whedon's doing) felt forced most of the time. I liked the Flash occasionally, and I love Ezra Miller, but he was mainly annoying. Which made me sad. Along the lines of tone, which was pretty unidentifiable, the action would often come out of nowhere. This made it feel choppy as well as rushed. The CGI was either okay or terrible, there was no in between. It didn't feel like the movie was building up to anything, it was just...shallow. It felt like it skimmed the surface of what it really wanted to accomplish. There wasn't much chemistry between the members of the team, and no real reason that they should be a team. They just started doing things together and working together, and not questioning it. Unfortunately like Avengers, the one female character had a murky relationship with all the male team members, seeming like the creators of the movie are trying to broaden the possibility of a romantic storyline for future movies based on fan reaction. There were also too many sexualizing shots of Wonder Woman. 
Overall, it was an okay movie. There were some enjoyable moments like the lasso scene with Aquaman. I actually really liked Cyborg and Aquaman, which I didn't really expect to."

","Honestly, when the trailer first dropped and the way WB had done it and Suicide Squad with a really bad retro rock n' roll theme, I had a very bad feeling this was not going to be a good movie at all. Unfortunately, I was proven more than correct. Honestly, there's so much to talk about in that regard I could probably sit here all day, so I'll just try to go with some of the highlights..<br/><br/>1) Nearly half of everything in the trailer didn't make it into the movie. Now this might not be a really bad thing since trailers these days tend to give a lot of things away, but there were more than a few scenes displayed in them that were, theoretically, designed to get people to come watch. One in particular where Alfred looks up and says: He said you'd come. Let's hope it's not too late. Theoretically he was talking to Superman, which might have made a hell of a lot better intro for the Man of Steel, but it was left on the cutting room floor. There was a lot of that and it's really pretty annoying since it felt like we got a movie that wasn't advertised.<br/><br/>2) The characters. None of them with perhaps the exception of Wonder Woman were executed well at all. Superman's revival basically took the ending of BvS, where the soil atop Superman's grave begins to float for a split second before the movie ends and gave it the middle finger. We as moviegoers, were led to believe that his return (which the entire world knew would happen) would be something far more epic than what it was. It was really a letdown. Beyond that, the characterization was just kind of... meh. He had more humor one-liners in this movie, but it actually off and wrong because he didn't have any of that in the previous movies. You can't take such a serious character and suddenly have him cracking jokes like he's always done it. Batman... sigh, Batman. WB/DC, what the hell did you do to the Bat? I know a lot of people were upset that you aged Batman starting with BvS a la The Dark Knight Returns (which you blatantly ripped off for parts of BvS itself). Honestly, that in and of itself wasn't too too terrible. What was was the way you essentially neutered everything about Batman. He had one really great fight scene in BvS that really showcased what a Batman fight should be... and that's the only true Batman fight scene we get between it and Justice League. There was none of the physical prowess, brilliant detective skills, frighteningly good tactical skills, or technical competence. Hell, he only used TWO gadgets for the entire movie, one of which was his serious over use of the grappling gun. When you used The Dark Knight Returns as your design for Batman in these movies, you completely ignored the fact that Batman because even more dangerous when he got older because he became so much more cunning and ruthless. In this movie, he just seems old. Honestly, he really had no purpose in the movie other than being the guy that forms the Justice League. Aquaman and Flash, these two were horribly miscast and miswritten. Aquaman is not some rock n' roll badass. He's a noble character with a great deal of strength, but also wisdom since he is a leader. He's not some surfer brah. And where is Flash's smarts? Barry Allen is supposed to be a wicked smart forensic scientist and we see absolutely NONE of that here. All we get is a neurotic moron with a phobia of just about everything and absolutely none of the wisecracking humor the Flash is known for. And don't get me started on how he runs. Just what in the hell kind of running is that? He's just flailing his limbs around. NO ONE runs like that. Cyborg and Wonder Woman were the only two casting and writing choices that felt close to what they are in the comics, though Cyborg was far more serious. Still, in this case it worked for him. The rest... hell no.<br/><br/>3) The CGI. Way, way, way too much CGI. Just, WAY too much. I can't really say much more and I can't say it enough. It made the movie far uglier than it already was.<br/><br/>I'll just leave it at that. There's so much more but suffice to say this was a really bad movie. DC needs start waving the white flag, leave the live action stuff to Marvel since they can actually do it well, and focus on the animated movies. THAT is where DC can really shine because they've put out some phenomenal animated films (along with some real stinkers). Stay on those and leave your mark that way."

","I hate to compare with the Marvel movies but that will be hard to avoid, since Marvel has pretty much established its place with its superhero movies and that had became my bar in enjoying any future ones. DC is just catching up. And frankly, I think that's the reason I did not enjoy this much. I tried to be positive in my expectation of this movie and mentally prepped myself to enjoy this one, but it just didn't work as I hoped it would. At the end, my reaction was a big ""Hmm... "" with a pout.<br/><br/>But, it is not at all bad. I was still entertained by this movie because I am big fan of superhero movies. Thank God for Wonder Woman! Putting aside Gal Gadot's beauty being really captivating (and hard to turn away from .. and I'm a girl), Wonder Woman's play and weight on this movie was a plus for me. Frankly, I am tired of Batman and Superman, and it will take more for me to get interested in those characters (after so many past movies to give justice to those characters). Cyborg .. am still conflicted. Not sure if it is the acting or I just should not expect more from this character. Aquaman -- thought it will be more grand and the Flash -- character was just okay but when The Flash character has been established a long time in the TV series and you get a different character story in the movie, that is a bit disappointing. I hope DC will be good at planning the build-up stories of these characters. That's what Marvel did right. <br/><br/>I read in the news that Joss Whedon (Marvel) helped out in finalizing this movie. So it makes me wonder.. can it be that the goodness I got from this movie is because of what Joss had put in? Another Hmm..."

I enjoy Ezra Miller in the role but Ben Affleck just doesn't cut it as Bruce Wayne/Batman.

You might then get a sense of the who the characters are, what motivates them and drives them, but in this movie there is no time for character arcs or movie plot.

Every time she appears she lights up the screen. Luckily she appears regularly from start to finish. Kind of wish I was watching Wonder Woman II. The in between parts are bearable but Ben Affleck looks tired. As for the story itself the whole reincarnation of Superman thing is a bit silly. Don't really get the villain Steppenwolf's story. Sometimes it seems like a Superman & Wonder Woman photo shoot as the photogenic pair pose and posture. That isn't a complaint just a fact.

","Where do I start.... OK... DC are trying to jump into the success that Marvel has spent years building up to with the Marvel Universe, without any of the build up or effort. They made a mild effort with Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Wonder Woman and thought that was enough of investment to give us Justice League. So ill give you the reprised DC version of why this film sucked...<br/><br/>1. The dialogue is awful. Some of the character interaction is woeful. 2. The CGI is terrible. It is obvious that most of the Superman scenes have some, if not all, a CGI element. I suspect that Henry Cavil was unavailable for the script reshoots, therefore his dialogue had to be CGI'd in via his mouth movements. 3. The script is awful. The whole movie is just written to revive Superman. The backstory provided for the CGI villain is straight out of Lord of the Rings. 4. Pointless characters. Cyborg, The Flash and Aquaman have little backstory, it's been shoved in to warrant there appearance. While, as characters Cyborg and The Flash somewhat warrant their inclusion, Aquaman would would be hard placed to gain favour in the Sea Cadets.<br/><br/>DC should stop trying to emulate Marvel. Their movies work when dark and brooding. Look at the success of Christopher Nolans Batman trilogy and build on that style rather than the B movie movie version of Marvel your heading at."

","As a hardcore geek of Marvel and DC comics, when I learned that WB is planning developmentally DCEU (DC Comic Extended Universe) and I was so stoked and looking forward. I was hoping that WB will hire crew to Handle on doing the best at what Marvel Studio did. When Justice League Trailer first came out, I was beginning to have little doubt on this movie if I will truly like it. I decided to wait and see how movie critics have to say even movie goers. When I learned that JL received mixed review, I was little uncertain and not truly excited to see Justice League EVEN I wanted to have excitement within me to see this movie as same passion as Marvel Studio films. I decided to go and see it in open captioned and I sat down and I watched the whole movie. I am not IMPRESSED how the Justice League story line and also the cinematography wasn't this great. So I did enjoy it, but I am not awestruck by it anyway. My biggest disappointment of this movie is Flash's suit is not what I envisioned and also the lightning is blue which turned me off, Flash was suppose to have red or yellow lightning. So if you are not sure if it is worth it or not, my advice just waits for it to come out on DVD or Blu Ray. I felt so bad for WB, I wanted WB to have equal treatment as Disney handles Marvel Studio. I hope this Justice League will be a wake up call for WB to re-evaluate story line in DCEU."
"alltowerpodcast","4","2","4","27 November 2017"," Keeping on with the weak sauce...
","This movie is prime example of how DC is flopping so hard on their movies. The animated stuff DC has been pushing out has been excellent but the films have been pretty horrid. For the Justic league movie we find more of the same. They lack actual character development, Ben Affleck feels like he is phoning in the performance half the time and the rest of the time they seem to be putting Batman in a useless light as if he's not going to continue on. <br/><br/>A lot of the CGI for the Flash is horrid looking. While the actor and character are decent in the film they spent little time on making these moments amazing. Aquaman is in something of a similar boat, he looks great and most of the scenes with him are decently done but they still fall short. Wonder Woman is probably the best (again) making me feel a desire to see another Wonder Woman movie, but all of this combined we see a HUGE flaw. These are the A listers for DC and they are flopping so badly. While Marvel is swinging at us with some rather obscure characters and we are eating it up! This comes from the story telling more than anything. DC truly needs to step up that side of things... and if they would just do like they have with their animated stories we would be great I think.

"NDbportmanfan","5","2","4","27 November 2017"," Hoping There is a Director's Cut Because This is Pretty Uneventful
","Justice League consists of getting the six heroes together to fight Steppenwolf. We see how they interact with one another with comedic jabs and how each is destined to save the world. That is the core of this film as we are shown. It has been said WB chopped the film up as they don't want a long run time, so they can show more screenings of it. This is the third out of four films that have gotten this treatment and it is getting ridiculous. Snyder has a good vision for this universe and he obviously enjoys making it as a fan. All WB wants to do is market and merchandise the product; they could care less about quality. <br/><br/>This pieced together attempt is not good. Parts of the film had my attention but as a whole it fell flat with a poor CGI villain and an under-explained McGuffin that was the three mother boxes. The cuts were obvious as we were jumped around far too often which gave the scenes less significance. Some of the acting was pretty bad as well, mainly from Affleck and Gadot. The dialogue didn't help them either when they tried to joke about serious situations. DC can't just copy the Marvel model, they need to embrace their darker universe and give fans what they want. <br/><br/>The highlight was the performances by the other actors. I was surprised how much I like Cyborg and the suit looked better also. Flash was a good comic relief even though they made him a little dumb in some parts. Aquaman was as expected pretty awesome but he didn't get a lot of screen time. Most of his scenes we already seen in the trailers. Superman was better in this movie as he wasn't doom and gloom the entire time. I had no problem with his character in BvS but he had to lighten up a bit or the team thing wouldn't work.<br/><br/>I really wish some other company could take WB's place as they are ruining what could be a cool universe. I am sure casual movie goers would sit through a three hour DC movie if the quality was good as advertised. Star Wars: The Last Jedi will be 2 and a half hours and I am sure Disney will not lose money on that investment. I just don't know how many more screw ups WB wants to go through just for the sake of a larger profit.<br/><br/>After watching this I might be done siting through these. If the directors have less freedom than Marvel directors I am not sure what to say about the future of this franchise. There is zero creativity and it might get worse from here."
"barbagvido","7","2","4","21 November 2017"," It is a let-down, but still judged a bit too harshly
","Justice League is the 5th DCEU movie and all four of the previous ones were building up to this one (and it should have been more). So much set-up in the previous movies and did it pay off? No, it didn't. But is it bad? Definitely not.<br/><br/>First, let's talk a bit about the history of DCEU. Unpopular opinion here, I liked all DCEU movies so far (yes, even Suicide Squad, I'm gonna get so much hate for this), but I do realize it's very flawed and could have been done a lot better. Almost every movie was a missed potential, including this one. The main problem is that Warner Bros. worries too much and listens to criticisms more than it should. There's nothing wrong with listening criticisms, actually it can be a great thing, but WB gets very confused about them. Man of Steel worked okay, aside from some lack of development and a bit awkward pacing, I thought it worked. BvS was damaged by the editing. Of course there were more flaws like an overstuffed script with too much set-up and some scenes that had good ideas, but poorly executed. Maybe it could have been glossed over easily if they didn't cut it down so much. The extended version isn't perfect, but it's an improvement (even though the theatrical version wasn't as horrible as everyone was saying, it had style, it had ideas, it was different and was a spectacle). But that was supposed to be the movie to release. Then they panicked and listened to some really unfair criticisms about it being too dark. Not every movie has to be an action comedy, we have Marvel for that. And that led to crippling Suicide Squad. I still think it's entertaining and I like it for all it's flashy fun. I just had such an amazing time with it, I just couldn't hate it. Even though I see its flaws, but they didn't ruin it for me. Wonder Woman was finally, a success, so there was a lot of hope here. Aaand it feel a bit flat on its face.<br/><br/>It's not bad, just slightly above average. It provides some epic moments, but it falls into mediocrity, because WB got afraid of making risks. They cut it down, so it's not overlong, but it only ended up feeling incomplete. Long doesn't necessarily make for overlong. So it all feels very rushed and at times like you missed a few scenes, even though you didn't. Humor was hit-and-miss (miss more often than hit), so injecting that much humor and copying Marvel was a really, really bad idea. Some is okay, sure, but don't make it feel so forced. The characters are very underdeveloped, if they didn't want to introduce them in their own movies, then give them more time in this one. These are just some really bad creative decisions. Another thing DCEU surprisingly doesn't nail at all is the villains (even though I'm in the minority who liked Jared Leto's Joker), as much as DC usually does. And Steppenwolf is the worst of them all. He's a CGI abomination who looks like he wandered in here from some PS3 game. He looks as bad as Incubus, but he's an even lamer character. There's barely a motivation, just a typical power- hungry alien and actually, you barely notice him. There's not one redeemable quality. Not one.<br/><br/>Now let's get to the positives. It's very fun and has some really epic moments that show what could have been. The actors fit their roles, the characters as underdeveloped as they may sometimes seem, are okay presented and each one has something to do or some unique quality to them. The plot is a lot more clear and cohesive than BvS and only so slightly less thin than The Avengers. And has some gorgeously shot moments with beautiful cinematography (Gotham City looks amazing). The score by Danny Elfman is a bit forgettable, but has some surprising nods to some older DC scores. <br/><br/>So, all in all, there are a lot of cons, but I think the pros outweigh them. Once again, a DC movie is judged to harshly. It's not great, and it's definitely ruined by the studio, but it's entertaining and considering how production went, it could have been worse."
"PyroSikTh","4","2","4","21 November 2017"," We Need the Snyder Cut
","Justice League picks up an undetermined amount of time after BvS. The country still mourns the death of Superman, while Batman is out there taking out Parademon scouts and Wonder Woman is botching the plans of terrorists in London. When Steppenwolf appears to steal a motherbox from the Amazons, they come together to form the team and save the world. Pretty much it in a nutshell. There's no fancy plotting or complicated mysteries. Not even a sub-plot, everything is tied to this one path.<br/><br/>Firstly I'll start with the big elephant in the room; the tone. BvS was harshly criticised for being tonally dark, and Warner Brothers has reacted by ensuring Justice League does not fall to the same judgements. Lighter moments are welcome, of course, but it's at the cost of any real threat or suspense. Batman himself almost feels like a completely different character. The brooding, angry Batjerk from BvS is gone, and instead we get a smiling, wisecracking Batman who doesn't really know what to do with himself.<br/><br/>But you know what bothers me most about Justice League? It's the stylistic shift in tone; the superficial and aesthetic. Snyder was absolutely not finished with his vision when he stepped down, and Joss Whedon simply could not replicate Snyder's signature style. It shows. It shows really badly. Warner Brothers, wanting to capitalise on the director switch, decided to concentrate far too much on Whedon re-shoots (most of which are terrible) instead of polishing up the already questionable visual effects.<br/><br/>Steppenwolf is possibly the worst superhero villain I've seen in recent memory. Beyond being just a deep-voiced antagonist hell-bent on taking over the world, he just looks terrible, like a video game rendering from ten years ago. Cyborg suffers this same fate as well, looking like badly rendered plastic instead of the futuristic alloy he's meant to be made from. The fact they even went so far as to CGI his entire face for some reason as well just makes it worse. Like, you have Ray Fisher's face literally there, why would you CGI it in? And talking of CGI faces, I'm fairly certain Paramount used their contract with Cavill to have a stab at Warner Brothers. He could have easily shaved off the moustache and worn a fake one for M:I 6, or even had it CGI'd back in for a fraction of the cost. Instead we get a half-CGI'd Superman face that doesn't even look like Cavill. Oh god it's awful.<br/><br/>The other missing Snyder trademark is his reliance on music. There are some moments that feel intact from Snyder's auditory vision, like the opening of Superman's absence to Everybody Knows by Sigrid, but replacing Junkie XL with Danny Elfman was when my excitement for this movie hit rock-bottom. There is no A-List composer more boring or generic than Danny Elfman, and Justice League just goes to prove me right. The scenes hold no weight in the music at all, instead opting to sound flimsy and wishy-washy instead of punchy or emotional. It just peeters on in the background pointlessly doing nothing and not being guided by the direction of the film at all. What's worse is that it barely even registers the themes laid out in the previous films. <br/><br/>But all of this frustrates me so much because there are some genuinely great moments here. I've already mentioned how spot-on the casting was, especially for Flash and Aquaman, but what does remain intact from Snyder is still great too. The League vs Superman is the film's high point, and is Justice League's version of Faora zipping about in Man of Steel, or Batman taking out an army of thugs in a warehouse in BvS, or Wonder Woman stepping into No Man's Land. This scene shows Superman at his most bad-ass and most capable. Before he's just been holding back, but here he lets rip. He headbutts Wonder Woman into the ground from the air, asks Batman if he bleeds, and catches Flash in mid-speed force dash. But then the whole scene ultimately feels pointless because he rushes off and is barely seen again until the third act, leaving the League precisely where they started before deciding to resurrect him (which was equally as rushed and half- baked). <br/><br/>Warner Brothers lack faith in their product, in their cast and crew, and have no vision whatsoever. They react and go with the times rather than forging ahead with their own idea. They already did this once with Suicide Squad and look how they turned out. They had the groundwork for a solid superhero franchise that stood out from the pack in tone and artistic merit, but they didn't stick to their guns and gave in to the critics, resulting in a chimera of a movie that can't decide on a tone or a focus. Both Snyder and Whedon are great directors, but they're polar opposites, and asking one to pick up the work of the other is going to result in a mess. I didn't even bother sticking around for the second post-credits scene, because let's be honest, whatever it teases is never going to come to fruition. Warner Bros will probably shelve this shared universe after Aquaman next year. No doubt about it. I give it a 5/10."

","Justice League,I give Zack 6 outta 10 for effort. It wasn't bad and and it wasn't great either. Something was JUST missing to make it superb. The narrative was a bit wobbly at the beginning.However I did find the characters of Aquaman, Cyborg and especially the FLASH VERY ENTERTAINING. Perhaps Marvel have so got the SuperHero format locked it's hard for us to appreciate any comic book movies that deviate from the Marvel Template.<br/><br/>DC still have a long way to go in giving Marvel a run for their money..."
"sentient-74528","5","2","4","20 November 2017"," Okay... I guess? Sort of...
","I didn't like Justice League nor did I dislike it. Sure, it has its moments, but then it is sort of.. boring. The story picks up mostly from were it left in the Batman v Superman film, except that this time Bruce Wayne is not acting like a psycho. This time we are introduced to Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman. Cyborg is a very likable character, but there's not enough time to introduce him. So it looks like his story is quite an interesting tale, with an underlying tragedy, but we never get to really learn anything about it. We only know that he is supposed to be dead and this alien artifact was used by his dad to reconstruct him as a cyborg or something along those lines. Flash is mostly the comic relief. He is also briefly introduced, we learn that his mother is dead and his father was arrested in suspicion of her killing, but he thinks he is innocent. Aquaman is a bad-arse who likes helping poor communities in Norway. When Bruce Wayne approaches him he tell him he works alone and later on he joins the league for no apparent reason. We are quickly told that he belongs to the Antlantean people and he has some powers under water (duh) and that pretty much sums it up.<br/><br/>So, Earth has these alien cubes which are.. powerful. And there is a bad guy called Steppenwolf, who tried to conquer Earth millennia ago with the help of those cubes. The Earth-dwellers (humans, atlanteans, amazons, gods, etc) amassed a huge army to stop him and hid the cubes. Now it seems Lex Luthor's adventures with the kryptonean ship somehow woke Steppenwolf up. He wants the cubes and wants to conquer Earth, because that's what a bad guy does. When all heroes realise there is a serious threat, they join Batman to fight him. But Bruce Wayne thinks they need Superman. Now, the league has one of the cubes because of Cyborg. Somehow Bruce Wayne comes to the conclusion that the cube can revive Superman and so it does. Superman temporarily goes really crazy because he can't remember who he is, but after a couple of hours with Lois Lane he is back to himself.<br/><br/>The League then locates Steppenwolf in Russia or something similar, and he now has all the cubes. They fight with him. When Cyborg and Superman start separating the cubes, Wonder- Woman can fight Steppenwolf solo. She isn't the only one, everyone has a go and in the end they split the cubes with no serious consequences and Steppenwolf dies or something. And so it ends.<br/><br/>As I said, it's boring. And it doesn't make much sense. The first time over they needed a massive army to stop the bad guy, and now six people can do the same job. Sorry, I'm not convinced. Someone got the story wrong here, either the villain is waaay weaker than expected, or the League is too damn strong.<br/><br/>Either way, most main characters are very one-dimensional. DC has been repeating over and over again a huge mistake and it doesn't take much intelligence to pinpoint the problem: They should create a film for every single hero before throwing them together inside a box and selling it. I keep saying that The Dark Knight was a masterpiece of hero films and they were right to avoid making a new Batman too soon. But they are wasting time and huge amounts of money doing these crappy films. The only heroes with any kind of back-story are Superman and Wonder-Woman. Everyone wants to see more of them, we already met them, we already know about Superman's dad dying in the hurricane, his doubts about who he is and where is he from; we saw Diana's despair after she failed to stop the World War; we saw these characters grow and mature. We can relate to them because we know their story. Now, what's the story behind Cyborg? And behind Flash and Aquaman? What about Steppenwolf? We know nothing of these guys, just rumours. Nobody cares. The plot is too weak. So Steppenwolf wants to conquer Earth. Why? What's so special about Earth? Can't he conquer something else? Doesn't he have a plan? Don't we need more people to stop this guy? Can't it be more difficult? Say, get the League to recover one of the cubes or something, and continue the story later. Why all the haste? Show us small victories, difficult decisions, doubts, a bit of drama. This film doesn't have anything like that.<br/><br/>So let me finish by stressing this: This film is boring! Boring! DC is living in denial. If anyone with sense from DC Comics one day reads this, put this into your small heads: DC's films are spiraling out of control. You are doing it wrong. Stop doing it wrong. Is not that difficult. Get a decent writer. Whomever is heading this madness, has no idea what s/he is doing. Sack this person.<br/><br/>Wonder-Woman is a nice film. It stands by itself and is really cool. But Justice League... meh.<br/><br/>Oh yes, CGI is passable. Sometimes is good, sometimes is awful. That's a minor issue at this point."
"Jithindurden","8","2","4","17 November 2017"," Ultimate wet dream of comic fans
","Watching Justice League on the big screen was a wet dream of comic fans all over the world for years and finally it is fulfilled. The DC Extended Universe kicked off with Snyder's Man of Steel in 2013 which garnered mixed reactions from viewers and critics. The dark tone and the reimagining of Superman's character were not accepted by many people and the chaotic action scenes added more hate towards the best Superman film I have seen. Batman V Superman Dawn of Justice followed in 2016 to mostly negative reviews resulting from the butchering of Snyder's into 151 minutes. With a lot of plot holes and a convoluted plot, the released cut of BvS had been just an average film. But the Ultimate cut released on Blu-ray with 183 minutes runtime proved to be one of the best superhero films. Then came Suicide Squad, which was another film for DC that had to go on to be a panned by the critics. With an average script and disastrous editing, the film was mostly carried by Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Will Smith as Deadshot who made it watchable to an extent. Wonder Woman was the film I was most disappointed in DCEU that everyone else seems to love. With nothing new to offer plotwise aside some big blunders, no real character development, no memorable action scene and a laughable attempt to make it look like a feminist film it totally disappointed me. Now Justice League is out as the 5th film in the DCEU.<br/><br/>Justice League starts off with Batman facing the imminent threat of parademons lead by Steppenwolf from an alien world (probably from Apokolips) who are searching for three Motherboxes in the earth. To face the threat Batman and Wonder Woman tries to make an alliance with The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg.<br/><br/>Unlike Snyder's previous entries in the series, there is no building up of scenes instead from the first scene itself action starts in this action-packed film. The plot is kept simple to provide the superhero team origin story the main focus. Zack Snyder has always excelled at making great opening credit sequences and although not as good as some of his previous works, the post-Superman world is shown with remarkable visual flair.<br/><br/>The rewrites in the screenplay by Joss Whedon is evident in the lighter tone of the film and the joking around of the characters. Visual command of Snyder becomes more evident with scenes that were obviously part of Whedon's reshoots.<br/><br/>The appearance of Superman in Justice League was obvious for many reasons. The scenes following his return, I was having goosebumps for a whole lot of reasons that were totally unexpected. The interactions between Superman and Flash makes you hope for a future with more of those in the DCEU.<br/><br/>Aquaman and Flash proved to be the most entertaining characters even in the small spaces they got. Cyborg and Flash are in their beginning stages and have a long way to get to their full potential. The scenes from Atlantis provided some insight into what the Aquaman film may deal with. Aquaman was a badass character who is able to be humorous at the same time.<br/><br/>Yet the film leaves you longing for more. The numerous cuts by the studio are not as evident as that of BvS but still makes things too quickly approached which could have had better treatment. While a lot of the one-liner jokes works a lot of them felt too forced and doesn't really fit with the DCEU. The mustache removal of Henry Cavill was clearly visible and weird to look at in many scenes.<br/><br/>Whedon's involvement definitely changed the tone of the film which wasn't a disaster, but it would've been better otherwise. The film could've been much better if it was approached with darker themes that could've been explored here.<br/><br/>Superman's character arc and the Injustice tease from BvS is pointing towards a darker future, though the involvement of Snyder in an uncertain state and Whedon's current involvement doesn't give hope for that arc.<br/><br/>Even with all the problems in the film, it was entertaining and satisfying enough for someone like me with the childhood nostalgia for Justice League."

Hint: big guns)<br/><br/>Negative Points: - Batman's character is thinly written, he probably doesn't even fights steppanwolf. Similar for Cyborg and side casts. - Steppanwolf is bland - The backhround score hugely lacks impact thanks to last minute change. Check out the opening track ""beautiful lie"" in BvS, you'll know the difference. - 2 Hrs screen time instead of 2 Hrs 50 Min - Thus, whole movie feels rushed and abrupt endings of scenes<br/><br/>If you're not able to resist to see it in big screen or are not familiar with superhero movies, don't see it wait for director's cut.<br/><br/>Giving 6/10 now, which i'm sure I will rate again after watching the full release which i know will be better.

"themovieparadise","4","2","4","18 November 2017"," Underwhelming
","If I were to never have seen Justice League, I don't think I would have missed anything. It lacks any real sense of suspense or any kind of emotional stakes. They keep saying over and over about how Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds) is going to destroy the world and everything will be lost, but I don't feel it. Justice League uses a lot of blatant explanation and exposition in order to try to make you care for these characters and their quest, but it doesn't work. I feel entirely indifferent to what is happening on screen. I don't hate what is happening; I just don't care about it at all. The film certainly feels like it has undergone extensive re-shoots. For the first thirty minutes or so, the movie just moves scene to scene to scene. There is no real connective tissue bringing these scenes together; they all just happen one after another. I think this is where Joss Whedon tried to reshape a lot of the movie, and the result is a start-stop jagged feel that breaks any sort of investment I have each time the movie abruptly decides to move on to something else. It feels like there's a lot more to the story that has either been cut out, or re-shot to maneuver around, and it makes it all feel superficial. Because so much work has gone into reshaping and reworking this movie, nothing actually feels authentic. I am not immersed in the story, because the story is a Franksteined-together collection of two visions..."
"andlu-13737","7","2","4","19 November 2017"," See it, but don't expect perfection
","I've been looking forward to this movie ever since Batman v. Superman last March. Ever since the first trailer dropped, I knew I had to go see it. Fast forward a year later to this weekend, I finally saw it. Did it live up to my expectations? That's hard to say, because I think whenever I get super hyped for a movie, I'm bound to be a little disappointed when all that anticipation has to be put into 2 or so hours. So I suppose did I like it is the better question... yes, I thoroughly enjoyed it; but there were a couple things that I didn't like. Pros: it was incredible fun. It didn't take itself too seriously, which was refreshing. I was never one who hated the dark tone of the previous DCEU movies, but it was still nice to see a fun movie. The Flash was one character in particular that I thought was cool. I know everyone is saying that, but he really was. Superman was also really cool, being more happy and hopeful, while not feeling like a completely different Superman. The Green Lantern appearance was super cool to see, even though it was just a random one. Even if some characters were slightly underdeveloped, they have great potential to be otherwise. The post-credit scenes (mostly the second one) were great. Seeing Deathstroke was an extremely welcome surprise, also setting up some potential plot points for later movies (Injustice League?) Cons: the whole thing felt a bit rushed and jumbled together. So many scenes that would have added so much quality to the film weren't even included, and it felt like it needed some more substance in a lot of areas. Character development, several side things (Atlantis, Lois Lane, Commissioner Gordon, etc.), and story elements in general felt a bit lacking. Superman's return I also feel was a bit downplayed, and less impactful then it would seem that it should have been. The league actually using a mother box to resurrect him felt a bit odd, but not completely off by any means. Verdict: Not a perfect film, but great visuals, extremely fun, and overall a great superhero flick. Excited to see what comes next (as long as Batfleck sticks around)."

","So the wait is finally over.Had my expectations low after criticisms of how WB made a mess of a movie by cutting off 45 minutes of the movie,but the movie ended up being pretty good.Didn't witness such a pacy screenplay in Hollywood in a long time,the 2 hours passed in a blink of an eye.Due to Joss Wheldon's influence,JL reminded me of Avengers in several places and there were plenty of jokes,but they were fine except for the flash,who was more annoying and whiny than funny.Superman's moments in the movie are beyond doubt the best parts of the movie.As far as the negatives are concerned,I really missed Hans and Junkie XL in this movie.Danny Elfman's score was nothing more than fillers to the narrative.There were a couple of scenes where the old themes were used and that was the only consolation.And barring a few slow mo scenes,I felt Zack Snyder's touch lacking.Lets hope we get the full extended director's cut soon"
"grthewizardoflol","6","2","4","19 November 2017"," For dc people: stop going from one pole to another
","I had many expectations for this movie, especially when Joss Whedon came in. Generally it is just a fun 2-hour movie but that's it. Not something incredible.The executives in WB were so afraid in the event that justice league sucks, that they took no risks and cut at least 50 minutes of scenes which were considered in Snyder's cut. The mayor problem of DC , in my opinion, is that they hear the opinion of the fans and they apply it in an extreme degree ( ex. BvS plot was too complicate, OK let's make justice league with the simplest plot ever , Bvs was too long, OK let's make justice league the shortest superhero movie and cut numerous of scenes included the ones that are shown in trailers.) why less than two hours? why the initial scenes were connected too rush? This movie has its flaws and its advantages. it accomplished the most important chemistry between the characters-heroes. The members were good overall: Batman : Batflek was nice ,the costumes very well-performed wonder woman: same old good from the standalone film flash:comic relief , i want to see more of him, his powers weren't developed Aquaman: bad ass , very little screen time but i want to see more of him Superman: finally the superman we want , he does put a smile, cgi mustache awful , i wanted black suit but was re shoot ... Cyborg: i wanted him to be more bulky , the suit it's OK , i like that the re shoots humanized him , i want very much to see his standalone film. In general this film was all the time in rush to catch the train (we have to introduce them fast and we have to make them a team as soon as possible,then we have to beat the bad guy and set the ground for the next films(justice hall). The villain was meh, a generic guy who wants to destroy the earth ,not something new. The film has done things that others films did it better (avengers),it is not memorable and re-watchable. It has some fun , Josh put light in this film and tries to create a marvel film in the DCEU. The problem is that there isn't a plan, what the direction of the franchise is? they change the direction every time that the fans blast them with negative rates. dc choose one path and stay consistent in the foundations of this direction. In conclusion, the plot was simple the fun was quite satisfactory, the cgi was terrible in some things due to the fact that the change of the directors, it was too short, they cut some real good scenes, the dialogues weren't something memorable but if you are a fan you will like this. P.S i wanted to answer in some unanswered questions in BvS (Dream sequence, cyborg's origin's etc.)"
"arungeorge13","5","2","4","19 November 2017"," DCEU ensemble film feels rushed! [+53%]
","I'll admit this: 'Justice League' isn't the worst DCEU film out there (the worst one is 'Suicide Squad', in my books) but it definitely won't exude the kind of glee you'd get by watching a Marvel ensemble venture, even with 'The Avengers' helmer Joss Whedon doing some last-minute tweaking business. This is very much a Zack Snyder film in terms of tone, color palette, hazy character building, and CGI-filled action.<br/><br/>Supes is dead, Batman feels guilty and before long, a bigger alien invasion looms. Snyder dedicates funky introduction scenes to each member of the League - we really didn't need intros for Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) as their characters were established quite capably in 2016's 'Batman v Superman' and 2017's 'Wonder Woman', respectively. Shouldn't the three newbies (Arthur Curry a.k.a Aquaman - Jason Momoa, Barry Allen a.k.a The Flash - Ezra Miller, and Victor Stone a.k.a Cyborg - Ray Fisher) be getting those extra minutes of screen-time for them to get acquainted with the viewers as well as to construct solid reasons for them to be joining the team.<br/><br/>Also, the villain Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciaran Hinds) - sigh. What a mess they've made in shaping the chief antagonist character - his reasons (for even existing) don't come across as one bit worth the buy. Not once does he feel like a threat to humanity as such, or to the league. BvS addressed the issue of loss of human life as part of the superheroes' attempts to 'save the world' through plain human characters (the Director's cut is rather well-rounded). Here, we neither get to see the baddies from the eyes of the public, nor do the heroes seem interested to connect with their earthlings. It also doesn't help that, when it comes to the set-pieces, the spoils aren't apportioned slickly. In most cases, it's Barry Allen who gets the juiciest bit of the pie, comfortably stealing the thunder from the rest. And for those who haven't seen 'Batman v Superman' (or 'Wonder Woman'), 'Justice League' would pose a lot of questions, even though it possesses a narrative of its own.<br/><br/>If you've had an eye for both Snyder's and Whedon's past works, it is quite easy to distinguish their individual contributions in 'Justice League'. Their styles are evidently poles apart, and when an effort is made to mesh Snyder's dark, brooding approach with Whedon's humanized character-crafting technique, the result turns out to be a mixed bag. Ezra Miller's The Flash seems to have gotten the maximum benefit out of Whedon's comedic intervention - he is quite like how Tom Holland's Spiderman is to Marvel. Aquaman and Cyborg, even with their separate 'I-save-everyone-else' scenes, don't get to leave a concrete mark. I mean come on, just look at the segment where Wayne asks Barry to 'save just one person' - where are such scenes for Curry and Stone? Simple answer - there aren't.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is criminally underused in this flick after her excellent individual outing in the Patty Jenkins film earlier this year, though I'd have to say I liked the idea of Supes (Henry Cavill) finally getting a well-defined sense of humor (even though he shows up quite late in the film - that isn't a spoiler, duh!). Batman/Wayne is less sombre in 'Justice League' than he was in BvS, and he kind of takes pleasure in reiterating his inability to lead the team (a not-so- subtle hint at Wonder Woman assuming charge in the near future).<br/><br/>The mid-credits (fun!) and post-credits (story-forwarding tool!) do tease the DCEU's future in mildly intriguing fashion, but one is left to wonder whether viewer interest is still strong for further expansion of these story lines - the universe has been dealing with rough seas ever since its cinematic inception. Critics and audiences have both never held back from lambasting most of the ventures (barring 'Wonder Woman' which was an excellent standalone). 'Justice League' does have plenty of issues in its two hour run-time but there's one thing it somehow manages to do in between - engage. For an ensemble film with a $ 300 million budget featuring some of the most iconic comic-book characters ever, 'Justice League' falls well short of expectations.<br/><br/>Verdict: 'Not-bad' just isn't enough for a movie like 'Justice League'. It needed to be ground-breaking!"
"jshoesmithkr","7","2","4","19 November 2017"," Disappointing
","DC just isn't understanding themselves. They produce Man Of Steel with a powerful villain and weak hero and then they end it by one simple punch which kills the villain. Batman VS Superman just wasn't what is should have been. They fought for about two minutes and then were allies the rest of the time. Doomsday killing the weak Superman was the only thing that saved the film. Suicide Squad I haven't seen so can't judge but I am guessing that the reviews are may be accurate but they may be a little bit too harsh. Then you did produce a very good film, Wonder Woman. Good villains, a hero that can actually stand a chance and an ending which everyone will love. But then Justice League makes a wrong turn.<br/><br/>They introduced the heroes in a clever way, Flash obviously being one of the better ones but there wasn't enough of something. Steppenwolf just seemed like a random villain who needed a couple of magic boxes to end the world. He probably only killed about two minor people and that was about it. There was no origin and he didn't stand out very well. For a film which tries to act like the Avengers, it wasn't doing a good job. The heroes were fine except from Superman obviously and Lois Lane is someone we want more of in the films. The ending was boring, the build up took a bit too long and the action that was used was OK. The action saved it really and some of the CGI. <br/><br/>In order for DC to improve it needs to start introducing better villains like Bane, Mr Freeze and Joker. Although, the dark Knight trilogy and Lego Batman Movie are probably better examples of using these sorts of characters. Overall 7.3/10 for this film, in some places it would have been lower or higher. For those who prefer DC to Marvel, get it right. Marvel has better movies like Thor Ragnarok and Guardians Of The Galaxy. Even Avengers did a better job at creating the team. When you think about what you liked better out of the Marvel and DC films, more Marvel will be liked. The only time DC might be better than Marvel is when watching some of the Xmen films.<br/><br/>Watch this film if you have to but don't expect the sort of battle scenes or decent story you'd expect from Marvel because you may leave feeling rather annoyed."

","With Superman dead, crime is rampant, hope is deteriorating, and Batman(Affleck, sad to be here, no longer brooding because it polled poorly) feels a need to redeem himself for his role in Big Blue biting the... spear. Paranoia apparently washes right off. He puts together a team(who will occasionally even work together when they face off against enemies) of people with powers, as evidence mounts of an alien invasion.<br/><br/>This is essentially a series of well-done if repetitive(if Steppenwolf(Hinds, who voices a full CGI character brought to life with bad effects) is in a place, he's probably there to get a MacGuffin Box, and most likely, he'll get it. You wonder why these people even pretend to be keeping them from him, and if they couldn't have done more to make them hard to get to) action scenes, with materials connecting them – basically, you need to get the people from point A to point B, so every single fight isn't set in the same location. It is deeply forgettable. Meanwhile, I'm not going to pretend I didn't enjoy myself. For many, that will be enough. It's very clear what is done by Snyder and what by Whedon, and both do some things right, other things wrong.<br/><br/>Barry(Miller, funny, socially awkward) isn't annoying. Aquaman(Momoa, really going for that Wolverine status) comes off as a whiny adopted kid in an adult's body, and you don't buy him joining the rest. Cyborg(Fisher, going for RoboCop) goes back and forth between ""I can't control the unpredictable tech growing in me"" and ""here's how we're gonna do this because I now know what I can do and no problems accomplishing it"". The introduction of these three is rushed and underwhelming. It feels as though we're expected to have watched the three solo movies that have yet to come out yet. Wonder Woman(Gadot, who does raise a lot of the meh material she's given) is given little to do, and it's clear that those behind this don't love her character like Patty Jenkins, Gal, and 90% of everyone who watched her own film.

It wasn't anywhere near as dark and depressing as the other movies despite the storyline. I also didn't find myself bored during the action sequences like I did with Thor Ragnarok.<br/><br/>From the assembling of the varied team members, to the giant set/battle pieces, there was the right mix of humor, pathos and downright thrilling heroics.<br/><br/>I won't say that it was a perfect movie since there were two parts of the movie that I just didn't care for. I thought the villain was another in a long line of supposed world beaters that came off as more of a buffoonish cartoon than someone I would need to be afraid of.<br/><br/>And the movie did drag a little in spots when they had some character development scenes with minor characters. I know that they are important, and not all of them dragged, but at times I found myself think, ""Get On With It Already"".<br/><br/>That said, those were my only noteworthy complaints about the film and I can only hope that this is the path the DCU movies will take from here on out.

","While this movie had so much potential... Much of it fell in the water, thanks to the fairly predictable, ""me-too"" guarantees of using cliché, generic plots, generic henchmen, a bad-ass looking but even more generic villain, way too much CGI - even in places where it should have been done more practically and CGI added for highlights or effect (like make-up on a face). Where did that 300 million dollar budget go? And what silly person came up with the idea to replace all of Hans Zimmer's music with the old theme songs? Lost most of the epic feel of the movie right there...<br/><br/>Now, if certain actor's acting skills are not up to snuff... then it's up to the director to make sure the camera work, edits, and lighting, carry and cover that. That wasn't done well at all. Gal Gadot's acting needs work, and Jason Momoa the same; even if the lines they gave him were plain silly, a good actor finds a way to make it sound interesting.<br/><br/>Have the people in Hollywood learned nothing of Logan (2017), with Hugh Jackman? More realism in comics is what sells. Correct screen adaptations are what sells. The people buying comic books, paraphernalia, collector's's items, etc, have money to spend - they are not children. And stop trying so hard to inject jokes or silly behavior into almost every other scene or line... the characters come across as immature and sometimes a bit retarded.<br/><br/>Anyway, the story was weak. In itself that is not a problem, but the way it was portrayed... was well, weak. It's not possible to drown it in colorful CGI with fast cuts, and hope the audience doesn't catch on. Warner Brothers should penalize the person who insisted that the whole story needed to fit inside two hours - the pacing was too fast, detracting from the whole what-was-supposed-to-be-epic feel; which was already deeply in trouble thanks to the weak soundtrack.<br/><br/>It is very clear that DC needs to stop worrying about Marvel; whatever Marvel is doing, is not DC's concern. DC needs to focus on doing their own thing."
"Kranadon65","5","2","4","18 November 2017"," DC has a long way to go
","DC so far has lagged way behind Marvel in entertaining movies. Only Christian Bale's Batman has lived up to the hype. I did like Wonder Woman too but it still isn't top notch for all its hype. Justice League is a mess of a movie , it actually had me yawning for most of it. The action is boring and the villain is really a disappointment. Steppenwolf ? wasn't that a rock band in the 70's?. If anything why didn't they have Darkseid? . And of course during the end credits we have Luthor and Deathstroke appearing hinting at the Injustice League. Looking at box office results, the Justice League better pick it up to even break even. 5/10"
"freddyj8882002","4","2","4","18 November 2017"," OK, but not really very good.
","I just got home from watching this mess. I went there wanting to like this movie, the same as I go to any movie. I don't expect much anymore based on the hype that movies get and then turn out to be so bad. I found this movie to be slow paced and boring.There seemed to be a lot of conversation about nothing. They tried to add a little humor to the movie, but the best they could get was the flash character. The rest of the humor was a waste of time. I am big fan of Jason Mamoa, but he could have been left out of this and wouldn't have been missed. The Justice League team didn't seem to come together in this movie and you didn't really care if they saved the world or not. If you go to the early show, you should be able to stay awake from start to finish. Don't go to a late showing."
"Jatzel","7","2","4","18 November 2017"," An enjoyable transition in the DCEU
","After the very polarizing critical failures of previous entries in the DC Extended Universe, the year 2017 was seen as do or die for the franchise and it got off to a good start with Wonder Woman, which was universally well received by critics and fans alike. In Justice League, we have a dream film for many who were first introduced to the comics world through the various adaptations of DC characters for both big and small screen. The idea of seeing the epic team-up of said characters in a big budget project was something many fans from different generations could only fantasize about for a very long time and with it finally happening, there was a sense of caution, considering the sour recent experiences. The result was a very enjoyable film that while not a masterpiece, wasn't really trying to be one. The flick succeeds in its' most important mission which was giving fans a fun two hours. <br/><br/>There are more than a few negative aspects of the movie. For instance, the short run time makes it difficult to properly explore the characters who probably could have benefited from a closer look at them. When it comes to the villain, Steppenwolf of ""New Gods"" fame, I don't think even more time could have made him a credible threat as he is about as empty as a filler bad guy of the week TV episode. <br/><br/>While Superman is definitely one of the better parts of the movie, his return to life feels somewhat hollow in meaning, considering that Henry Cavill is the second name in the opening credits and that there was never a reasonable doubt about his being a fake out death. One that was not properly built up as it happened in only his second film. This time, it feels like the best improvement made was exactly in the handling of Supes, presented as a beacon of hope for the world, which would've been much more meaningful if it had been shown like that in previous outings. <br/><br/>The CGI, as you might have read or already seen, is very disappointing and at times it seems inferior to even the Injustice video games. That is unforgivable on a project with such a large budget and while it doesn't detract too much from the movie going experience, it still is very distracting and should be vastly improved in future entries. <br/><br/>Putting the negative aside, this was a welcome change in tone. The touch of Joss Whedon is very noticeable and it's a shame he wasn't brought on earlier in the production. We got superheroes instead of dark and gritty antiheroes that do not always work. A team that was actually saving people rather than causing a lot of the destruction that terrified citizens to begin with. They are now very likable thanks to the dialogue and better chemistry between all involved.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller, playing the role of The Flash as basically Spiderman now is for the Avengers as a kid working alongside veteran heroes does a good job and my only complaints are that he is basically Wally West with the Barry Allen name. His origin story has a very big hole, but I believe that will be better explained in his own movie. <br/><br/>Gal Cadot is perfect once again as Wonder Woman and her story as a reluctant hero gets properly developed. That is of course one of the benefits of having separate movies to establish the members of a superhero team as it helps flesh them out more. Here, we understand Diana's doubts, her motivations and reactions thanks to the fact that we already know the character independently from the League. Ben Affleck does a good job with what he is given for Batman and proves a good transitional leader, being forced into that position by the circumstances around him. He assumes the responsibility of a world without Superman, knowing quite well that he can never become that symbol. The traditional loner becomes the uniting factor here and left me wanting more of the character, in a good way. <br/><br/>I didn't care much for Aquaman and Cyborg, but they are good utility players here and think there is a lot of good that can be done with them in the future. Which in the end, is what this movie does, give us a transition from one vision that didn't work to one that hopefully does much better. Man of Steel and Dawn of Justice for the most part, were not fun, but Justice League was. Once you bring entertainment back to the center of film making, you are going in the right direction. I understand and perhaps even agree with most of the criticism for the movie, but I think audiences will be greatly pleased with this leap in quality. Just like The Flash is seen getting used to his speed and stumbling, we are seeing a franchise growing accustomed to its' powers in the lead to something that can be great."
"BecauseIAmBATMAN","6","2","4","18 November 2017"," Not the iconic film it should have been
","Its the film that is the team up of the most iconic heroes of all time so naturally it should have been one of the most iconic movies of all time right?<br/><br/>But its just a mediocre movie. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie a lot, even if it has a lot of problems. I enjoyed it because I am already a fan of these characters. Watching them come together had the inner fanboy in me squealing in joy added to the plenty of DC fan-service. But if you watch the film as a non fan who has no knowledge of any of these characters and their back story, you may or may not find it entertaining but would forget the entire film just as it ends.<br/><br/>With WB putting a mandate of having the film be less than two hours, you can see easily that something feels missing. Its not exactly plot because the plot is nothing more than aliens invade, team assemble, save Earth. The thing that's missing is a natural flow. Editing feels chopped, the pacing feels rushed and the film lacks any sense of tension.<br/><br/>This film had a rushed production and it shows. The CGI feels unfinished and wonky at times, especially Superman's face. They used CGI to remove Cavill's mustache during re-shoots but didn't do a very good job at it as his face looks distractingly weird a lot of times. It also seems like most of Superman's scenes were re-shoots. The villain Steppenwolf is one ugly CGI monster and a rather unmemorable one for the League to be facing. Hence the stakes don't feel huge even if the world may be ending. But the strength of the film that is entertaining is the team chemistry and watching them come together.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's music is more forgettable compared to the more grandiose and electronic themes Zimmer used in Man of Steel and BvS except for a couple of spots where he reuses the classic 78 Superman theme and his own 89 Batman theme. The music orchestrates the tone from the classic Justice League animated series which I personally liked since the animated series is amazing. This film overall does feel like sort of an episode of the series to its credit.<br/><br/>Ultimately it seems like WB wanted to react to the criticisms of BvS. You thought BvS was too long, here is something short. You thought BvS was too dark and serious, here is something light and fluffy. You thought BvS was too convoluted with too many subplots, here is a simple story with no subplots. In the end this delivers an entertaining and accessible film that is unfortunately forgettable which is disappointing. But given the troubled production history of the film, I had expected worse.<br/><br/>In the end what should have been an iconic film ends up being a wannabe second rate Avengers film."
"TheFirstExecutioner","6","2","4","18 November 2017"," A Step in the Right Direction, But Still a Far Ways to Go
","Justice League picks up after Batman v Superman, in a world in which Superman no longer exists. He is mourned and Steppenwolf pounces on this new vulnerability of Earth to achieve his evil plan.<br/><br/>As someone who was thoroughly disappointed in Batman v Superman, I didn't really know what to expect from this movie. But I can say Justice League is an overall fun time. The most important job this movie had to fulfill was to make the viewers buy into this team, and I think it was a success. This team functions really well as a unit. I enjoyed watching them fight together throughout. The team chemistry is rocky in the beginning but gradually improves throughout, as it should. Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman are all pretty cool characters and I can't wait to see more movies with them. The tone of this movie is also rather relaxed and lighter than usual, which is a pleasant surprise. <br/><br/>As for negatives, there are a lot but most of them can be overlooked. First and foremost, Steppenwolf continues the trend of these new DC movies and is not just bad, but awful as a villain. Never once did I fell he was a menacing villain. No development is given for him and he just shows up whenever he wants to. It just seems like the DC movies are whiffing on their villains and hoping the heroes can make up for their shortcomings, and that better not be the case once Darkseid is involved. Second, it's so blatantly obvious how much was edited here. The first half was much of a drag for me. The setup is handled sloppily, again because of the excessive editing. The action scenes, especially the finale, look like a giant video game. Another trend in Snyder movies, there is barely any regard for civilians. Honestly, I can pick this thing apart but I know it wouldn't be right because of the struggles the crew had while filming.<br/><br/>What brought life into this movie is Superman. No Spoilers but his scenes are by far my favorite. This is the Superman that we all wanted to see all along, and Henry Cavill is amazing. If Superman was mishandled again, this movie would've been a disaster but thankfully that didn't happen. Everything they did with the character worked for me.<br/><br/>To wrap it up, Justice League is a mixed bag for me. The characters work well as a team, which at the bare minimum is all I wanted, and this definitely a step in the right direction from Batman v Superman. The movie is good enough that I want to see more, but this universe needs much more work in order to shore up the plot and tonal issues. Good villains would help too.<br/><br/>Justice League gets a C+."
"ThomasDrufke","7","2","4","17 November 2017"," A Jumbled Mess that Still Kept Me Smiling (For the Most Part)
","I've waited years for Justice League. I've been wanting to see the greatest superheroes take the big screen together for as long as I can remember. Sadly, the biggest takeaway I had after stepping out of the theater was that we could and should have waited longer. The production of this film, and really the PR for the DC Universe as a whole, was an absolute mess. I don't think we'll ever get to see Zack Snyder's initial vision for this film, and that's unfortunate. But what we got is a jumbled mess of a film visually and thematically, with some undeniably fun moments mixed in. (FULL SPOILERS FOLLOW).<br/><br/>It's hard to review a film like that, which is why I waited until after I saw the film a second time, but even now I'm not exactly sure how I feel about the finished** product. Because in reality, this film is so far from finished it's honestly sad that it was put in theaters. So I guess that's where I'll start, the visuals. Coming off visually stunning films like Man of Steel and even Batman v Superman to an extent, Snyder's visual aesthetic is beginning to fade on my taste. That's not all his fault, as he didn't have anything to do with the film for the last 8 months, after suffering a personal tragedy. The people at fault here are the executives at Warner Bros who allowed this film to be released now instead of waiting until the visual effects are finished. You know something is wrong when almost every scene involves the background shots to be in soft focus (a dead ringer that the CGI/green screen effects are far from finished, and that's not even mentioning the completely muddled 3rd act final fight.<br/><br/>But let's talk about the good before we get too deep with the issues. The tea itself is fun, and they worked better together than I expected. I won't even say that half of the jokes/inner play works because a lot of it feels forced and re-shot a mere month or two ago, but I was definitely smiling watching the league together for the first time. Aside from the fact that he's 100% not returning after JL, Ben Affleck was serviceable as Batman. Ezra Miller certainly provided the most comedic relief. Jason Momoa showed me enough to get me intrigued for Aquaman. Cavill was of course great as Superman. Ray Fisher was leaps and bounds better than i thought he would be as Cyborg. And Gal Gadot was expectedly the best part of the film as Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>The other good comes from the runtime and pace of the film. And I mean that strictly in terms of the fact that there isn't an hour of that passes in between action sequences (BvS). The film flies by. Now does it actually flow from one scene to the next? No, not really. You can't really tell what scenes Whedon added in, but you can tell that this film was still a work in progress all the way up until its release, which is why nothing seems to flow for a good portion of the film.<br/><br/>Briefly, I would like to touch upon Danny Elfman's score, which is utterly forgettable. With all the fuss about him using old Batman and Superman themes, it's not even used in a memorable way. I wouldn't even be able to tell you what his JL theme sounds like because it was absent from the film in every way. He did not at all use the themes Hans Zimmer provided this universe to the best of his abilities.<br/><br/>The villain, Steppenwolf, played by brilliant Game of Thrones alum Ciaran Hinds, was like a Marvel villain in that he served his purpose, but failed to be memorable. There are a few scenes that are quite impressive with him, including an epic one on Themiscyra, but I'm not coming out of the film buzzing about Steppenwolf. <br/><br/>But I can say I enjoyed the team as a whole and individually. It's a lot easier to see that upon second viewing. And with that said, I'm definitely still wanting to see more with the universe going forward. Yes, the film looks pretty bad compared to other big superhero films. Yes, the action isn't fluid and is often times a CGI/video-game looking mess. Yes, they still haven't completely figured out the tone of these films. Yes, it seems Affleck is going to step-down as Batman. Yes the film does leave you with an after credits scene of Jesse Eisenberg (the worst thing this universe has ever put to screen, but more on that another time). And yes, I do actually believe this is a step down from Batman V Superman (in terms of being a film that moved me to have real emotions no matter what emotion that is). But I'm STILL on board for this universe, if they do some restructuring here and there. Why? Well, in the words of Wonder Woman, I'm a believer.<br/><br/>7.6/10"

","Do not watch this movie. I have many unpopular opinions so watched this movie to see if I thought it was as bad as everyone says. Spoilers, but it was. I don't understand why it was so hard for Warner Bros just to wait until Zack Snyder recovered so he could make his movie. Although Zack is credited as the director in the opening titles, this is clearly Joss Whedon's movie. It is completely out of place in the trilogy, and focuses more on bad jokes (imitating the hugely successful MCU) than meaningful subtext shown in 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman v Superman'. Steppenwolf brings the movie down further than I thought I would - a completely meaningless villain who says stupid comic book villain things like ""This world will fall"" and ""You will all suffer"". The Flash, for being a hero with super speed, really drags the likes of Batman and Wonder Woman (who were done okay in this movie) down to the ground. I don't even have the energy to talk about Superman's portrayal. This whole movie is just an attempt to recreate Marvel's charms, and fails miserably."

","Now,, before I start, I will say that I agree this movie had its fair share of problems. Pretty certain most of that was in post production.<br/><br/>No matter what,, I luved the movie. It's Batman and Wonder Woman recruiting Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg to fight the big bad that's coming (STEPPENWOLF). When I first saw a pic of what Mamoa was going to look like as Aquaman, I didn't know what to think. ""Isn't he supposed to be in orange and green?"" I thought to myself,,, but the more I looked the pic over,, the more I liked it (Auqaman is COOL now). Ezra Miller as The Flash,,, he's just too PERFECT!! Totally awkward and unsure,, in the best way possible (I've never done battle. I've mainly just pushed people and then ran away). Ray Fisher as Cyborg,, he was good,, I would like to see him again.<br/><br/>Now,,, we all know the theatrical release was not the version that Snyder intended. Due to the horrible tragedy his family suffered, he had to step away from the project. Then Joss Whedon stepped in to finish post production and also do some reshoots (I have to say that I am a big fan of Whedon. Big fan!!! Loved all his TV shows. Really loved Avengers 1 & 2). I'm pretty sure this is where the horrible mustache debacle came in (oh my goodness that was terrible!!!!). Now,, regardless of how much I enjoy both of these directors work,, they don't necessarily go together. Whedon's work is funny and witty,, and Snyder's work is more dark and gritty (WATCHMEN anyone?!?). I think that is where this movie project went a little bit wonky. Regardless,, I still luv the movie,,, but it could've been better in several areas. Imo, the theatrical release of JL was not on the same level as BvS:The Ultimate Edition. I'm hoping (and expecting) THE SNYDER CUT to bring us what we really wanted to see the first time (if they'd shown the BvS:The Ultimate Edition instead of the theatrical release in theaters, it would've done SO MUCH better at the box office. I imagine The Snyder Cut will go the same way).<br/><br/>Even with all the problems,, JL the theatrical release is still a great movie.<br/><br/>So go watch it!!!"

The main antagonist, Steppenwolf was just like a playstation character with as much depth and character. Also I hated the weird flying bug things.<br/><br/>The film has tried to adopt Marvels' formula where they have a big baddy which brings all of the heroes together but Marvel has been carefully planning for years where as JL just decided to try to squeeze it all in without any suspense. I never felt anything from this main villain and I was already bored with him after the first encounter.<br/><br/>The whole point (I assumed) was that they were all going to get together and defeat Steppenwolf together but superman just came in at the last minute to save the day... On his own which just made me face-palm. It was just a rush job. You can't get attached to any of these characters as you don't get any proper background. It's just a case of Bruce Wayne going round and saying ""we need to fight are you in?"" and them saying ""... OK""<br/><br/>I would say more but i can't be bothered to regurgitate the film as it was just so dull.

","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Justice League is a continuation of the DC cinematic universe after Batman v Superman and Wonder Woman. This movie features appearances from Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg, Superman, and Steppenwolf.<br/><br/>This movie like Batman v Superman has many problems. The re shoots that were needed harmed this movie's pacing. This movie has massive tonal shifts from its darker universe depicted in Batman v Superman to a lighter tone as seen in Marvel movies. Although this tone is welcome, the abrupt changes in this movie's tone is not. It is distracting to the film goer to be experiencing these tone shifts so suddenly. This movie had scenes that were certainly fun to watch for its joyful tone, but they ultimately led nowhere. It did not inform the viewer of character development or backstory the audience does not already know.<br/><br/>Steppenwolf as a villain is weak much like the singleshot Marvel movie villains. Steppenwolf did not have any build up from any previous DC cinematic universe movies.In this movie, Steppenwolf simply exists to be the antagonist and conquer the Earth. The way that the villain does this is to assembler three boxes of power and cause a cataclysm. This plot is incredibly generic. Although the movie suggests the ancient factions such as the Amazons and Atlanteans know of him, the movie only uses the scenes to provide action without plot. The movie's resolution to Steppenwolf is not satisfying. After Superman is resurrected, Steppenwolf is simply defeated. This defeated the entire purpose of founding the Justice League. The premise of the movie was to see how the world could be defended if Superman did not exist. The Justice League's decision to resurrect Superman only served to highlight how non-functioning the organization is by having Superman defeating the main villain.<br/><br/>Justice League is a movie with a lot of problems. However, the movie has great action scenes and an interesting world. These attributes may be enough for viewers and I would recommend anyone looking for solid action to watch this movie. To others that care about good stories in their movies, Justice League is not recommended.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

","Unlike BvS, in this all the characters have their character and personality defined.The Flash is the nicest of all, he is the comic relief all the time. Aquaman is like a rocker, a rebel without a cause who is enjoying ""la vida loca"" and I want to see him in his solo movie. Cyborg is the most bitter, as it is a marginalized human-machine- alien mix. Batman and Wonder Woman have a good chemistry, and WW is still amazing. This is the Superman that I wanted to see in the cinema. The aspect of the parademons is incredible, they are like a kind of hybrid between vampires and insects and the combats with the protagonists are spectacular. Steppenwolf is horrible, very soft, lacked rudeness and character, in addition the CGI is bad, it seems a badly made video game. The CGI in Themyscira for example is terrible, but the action sequence is impressive. The reshoots are noticeable, like the CGI to remove the mustache to Henry Cavill. The dialogues of the film are not very good. The story is simple and is set for the common viewer to understand, simply ""the bad guy wants 3 mother boxes to take down the world."" The film fix some holes in BvS. The colors of the film are really high, they are alive and with intensity, totally different from BvS because of what the darkness was criticized. The film is cut, the priority of WB is obvious, and the scissors between the action scenes is visible to the naked eye, in addition many of the scenes of the trailers are not here. The action is good but in the previous films it is better. OST of #DannyElfman is forgettable, you just hear the theme of classic superman of 1978 and Batman of 1989 (And at the beginning when it comes in WW you hear Hans Zimmer's). The previous films were action dramas and the change of tone of this film is action adventure and comedy (they started the change with WW) and take the right path. It is not an epic film but in spite of all the failures I have HOPE in this universe. I liked it very much. PS: the two post-credits scenes are very good."

","I like DC films. This is coming from someone who loved Suicide Squad. But this just didn't do it for me. It had its moments sure, but I was left extremely underwhelmed.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go into too much detail, but I'll just rattle off a few negatives.
This was a 300 million budget film. Yet, it just did not feel like one, CGI in areas was actually really poor, but it just didn't have the feel of a huge superhero movie.
The villain. Comes in and makes a huge entrance, but that's it. Doesn't really give us any info on the guy other than he wants to destroy the world and we don't really see him until the end. It was just a poorly done character in my opinion.
Jokes did not land. The limited comedy in this was very forced and just not very funny. The humour was almost to entertain a 5 year old.<br/><br/>There are some positives, some of the fight scenes were pretty good and shot well and the main characters were likeable enough. But yeah, it's a bit of a miss this film. It's not the worst thing you'll ever see. 5/10, some positives there and didn't hate it, but there are a lot of negatives also."

","I actually like DC superhero comics very much. Some people say that superheroes are the mythological stories of this era. In fact, DC heroes are more ""divine"" and more like gods than Marvel's. Specific to the story of the Justice League, the fall and resurrection of Superman, and the assembly of the Justice League, this can be told (or even supposed to be) a story about the annihilation and remodeling of faith. There is much to talk about here. The constructed conflict can profoundly shape the character image. But Warner always has the ability to smash a good hand. It perfectly wastes all the above mentioned, and makes a movie whose plot is comparable to the animation.<br/><br/>The words ""deep"" are the advantages of DC comics and animations, and the advantages of the Nolan version of Batman, but they are never the advantages of DCEU. Because in fact, DCEU movies have never shot ""deep"", and all of the shots are ""although everyone knows that I actually have no connotation but just pretend, but I still have to make a deep look"" The question of DCEU is never whether it should be deep or funny, but that this group of creators has not told a story that is reasonable and conflicting, the characters are credible, and all aspects are not rigid.<br/><br/>Even if it's a laugh, it's not so good. This is normal, and humor requires IQ. There are a lot of laughs in this film, some of them are not bad, but the overall feeling is too hard. Some of the laughing points are actually destroying the existence of the drama. For example, when the Super League later said to the master: ""I know you don't like me"", the master likes a little girl to support my incoherent words, so as to create a laugh and ""sweet ""This joke is too low-level, this rot is too low-level, because it comes at the cost of destroying the image of the old man. The most fascinating way to make a group of ""CP"" must be to never just show it off. Because the attractive premise of ""CP"" is that the two images that make up CP are charming. It's stupid to show off CP's image without sacrificing image.<br/><br/>There is another huge problem with this movie: it portrays Batman very badly. The master is a very special character. He is the only mortal in this group of gods. His absolute strength and other people in the Justice League have an insurmountable gap, but he has a core position in this team. This point is actually very important. Here you can fully dig into how a mortal man has found his place among the gods, how to view his own value, and can even create a very wonderful conflict from this, and perfect it by solving this conflict. The character of the old man. Even if you are limited in space, you can't talk about it deeply. However, no, there is no intention to write a deep article at all. The movie finally shows that the Flash is very funny, Wonder Woman is beautiful, the Neptune muscle is very good, Batman is very weak, nothing more. The audience's expectation is ""Look at how this film prevents Batman from appearing embarrassed because of his weakness"", and the movie was shot out as ""haha, Batman is so embarrassed, we even made it a laugh!""<br/><br/>I have always been angry about DC movies. It has a lot of good stories, extremely profound characters, and all the actors are beautiful in appearance and good in business. Unfortunately, Warner has never let people down. After I watched Thor 3, I felt bad because it completely gave up the slightly pursued opportunity and was willing to make an excellent assembly line product; while the Justice League's badness refers to it as an assembly line product, and it is not good."

","Justice League comes together and certainly doesn't feel free in it's creativity as far a story arcs are concerned. Where the restrictions come from is anyone's guess. Maybe it was due to Snyder being unable to complete shooting due to personal circumstances. Maybe it's the Hollywood comic book formula in trying to get all these stories to coincide with each other without some main characters even having their solo outing first. Where this film suffers most is lack of story development and a extremely weak villain in Steppenwolf. It doesn't really bring anything new to the table, it's basically a linear one dimensional storyline where Steppenwolf is in danger of taking over the planet using the energy he collects three motherboxes. These boxes have been hidden for centuries to keep out of the wrong hands. Meanwhile Bruce is assembling a team to stop him on a suspicion the end is looming. The actors do their best but they can't save a weak plot. Gal Godot reprising her role as wonder woman is solid and Ezra Miller brings the humour. But the tone of the film is all over the place. Something tells me Snyder's version will be a lot darker than what Whedon finished off. It's evident that this film was completed by two different men with very different visions. Whedons comedic light-hearted tone juxtaposed with Snyder's more serious outlook on the comic world and much darker style. Even the score was all over the place, Danny Elfman came in late and probably tried patching things up, but again for the most part things just seem out of place. This is close to a Batman and Robin blooper in terms of cheesy god awful lines and ridiculously inconsistent characters. Something is bleeding and it's bleeding awful. Ben Affleck done his best but he really didn't have the writing for this interpretation of batman. Why is he so obnoxious in this? Lines like when he mentions Steve Trevor seem so out of character even as a motivation tactic, his ideology seems mixed in this follow up of bvs. At times it feels like watching somebody play a video game especially towards the end where the battle scenes are full on CGI. Unfortunately this superhero film ended up in a league of their own and they definitely didn't do this film justice!!!"

","I think this film had a lot of problems from the beginning to the end. The change of director killed amazing film. Firstly, the plot has a lot of gaps and non-answered questions. You can see the phrase: ""You can't save the world alone"" on the poster. In fact, Superman save the world alone, and he doesn't need any help. Why we don't see Darkseid at all? Story of Cyborg almost isn't shown. Secondly, the cast is only one thing that is really goof, Gal Gadot, Ben Affleck, Jason Momoa and others are wonderful. Thirdly, the visual effects also have a lot problems (moustache of Superman).
So, I wait for announced Snydercut."

","JUSTICE LEAGUE is another epic-wannabe superhero flick, this time from DC Comics rather than Marvel. BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE was slated somewhat so this is different, more action-packed and much briefer in scope, represented by a running time that comes in just under two hours. Not only to Batman and Superman return, but they're now joined by fresh newcomers like Wonder Woman, the Flash and Aquaman. Generally it's a light and breezy affair, heavy on the inevitable CGI set-piece sequences, but with snappier and more humorous dialogue than before. I did find the main villain a little weak, a typical CGI baddie much like Sauron in THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and they manipulate Ciaran Hinds' voice so much you can barely tell it's him. Otherwise this is a light, popcorn-style movie, enjoyable as a one-off watch."

","I rewatched ""Justice League"" this weekend, for the first time since its Cinematic release to see if time and expectation improves the film at all. Unfortunately it does not, if anything it heightens the folly of the movie and the desire to compete directly with Marvel in a race they've already lost.<br/><br/>Wracked with guilt about his part in the death of Superman, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) discovers that the earth is under attack from scouts for an alien race that would rule the planet. He works to pull together a team of powered individuals that can mount a resistance but before he's ready, the villain Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds) arrives to secure and reunite three long forgotten energy sources.<br/><br/>It's not so much that ""Justice League"" is irredeemably awful; like an artistic idea that didn't resonate with the audience for example, or is just undone by one aspect of that undermines good work elsewhere. The film is just so staggeringly mediocre, in every aspect. A dull fetchquest story, punctuated by a number of uninteresting fighting sequences. Tepid banter between the cast. Generic CGI villain. It's all so bland, so uninspired and now has the added bonus of not being worth it as ""road to somewhere better"" as this appears to have been the final nail in the idea of an extended universe, with DC now looking to the much more sensible approach of asking interesting filmmakers to do what they want with the characters.<br/><br/>Having said earlier that there isn't one particular aspect that lets the film down, there is actually one that drags you out of it whenever he's on screen. The CGI work to erase Henry Cavill's moustache is always, staggering and distractingly awful. You can look at literally nothing else whenever he's on screen.<br/><br/>It's hard not to acknowledge the tragic circumstances that forced a change in director and for Joss Whedon to complete filming reshoots and editing. I appreciate that people would like to see what Snyder's true vision for the film was, however, I can't believe that there's some magic way to reedit this film and make it passable. The ""bones"" of a good film just aren't there for that to happen.<br/><br/>A waste."

","If I had to choose between DC or Marvel, I really prefer DC, let's be realistic in what marvel wins DC is in films of cinematic universe, in video games DC wins, in comics for the simple fact that it has the best history comic (Watchmen) wins, in movies outside any cinematic universe wins, in series well it is difficult because the only good series of marvel is Daredevil and that including the fact that really that is the best superhero series , so I will give marvel the point, but the point is that when DC strives for something it does very well, but when DC tries to do something for which it was not done it gives us this: Want to add a caption to this image? Click the Settings icon. While Justice League is better than Batman and Robin, that does not mean that it is above the mediocre, the biggest problem is that the film is so childish, the characters lack personality, the closest we have to a poorly developed personality would come being that of a boy who is angry at his dad for saving his life (Cyborg), the way Batman gathers the members is so simple is like a superhero ball game, Batman and the wonder woman go over there, over there asking everyone if they want to join their team of super friends, and all without considering it too much end up accepting. Something that I liked about Avengers: The avengers was that they really spend most of the movie stripping between them than with the villain of the movie which is completely normal and realistic because it really is the first time they live with each other, and it is normal that they do not get along, but in this movie no, here everyone is super friends who have no problem between them, which is the opposite of real life. And of all the villains they could choose, they chose Stevephen Wolf, the villain that only the fat man of the Simpsons knows and three more people in the world, instead of having put Darkside they put to that gift nobody that their objective is so silly and simple, destroy the earth because ......... Yes? Now everyone will think that darkside is the copy of thanos when it is the other way around, darkside came out first, in fact the avengers are the copy of the justice league, but now nobody will believe that because DC has not made good use of its content. The biggest problem is that the film focuses more on making a story for the next films than on making a good story for this one, that seller is the biggest problem in the movie, great proof that they didn't try very hard are the special effects, Let's be honest for the era in which we are those special effects are no longer valid, they are simply bad, and flash has its blue rays Why ........? Because Zack Snyder came from h $% # s. Do you want to add a title to this image? Click on the Settings icon. The movie had done well not to show Superman in the trailers, you didn't know how it was going to come back or how it was going to be, etc., but it is made to lose all that and gives us the typical story that revived someone and becomes evil blah blah blah, and as always love solves everything and a bing bang bung Superman returns to normal, and no one bothers to investigate because he is alive, instead the film better concentrates on making jokes fools, but this blatantly believes that if you copy a wonder your use formula stupid jokes everyone would love their movies, bad DC, bad. And as almost always happens in this type of movies lately, everything else is more of the same, they beat the villain and everyone lives according to the idea that men with super powers without supervision live among them. In conclusion Justice League is a simple and mediocre action movie that although I dare to say that it was something attractive to see the justice league for the first time together in a live action movie, but it does not stand out in any sense, the villain It's boring and repetitive as is the story, the special effects are terrible and I want to say that this criticism would be worth nothing if it were those marvelitas that praise a wonder as if it were a god, so if you are a DC fan and this movie you nice to let me tell you that the only thing you are is a sheep that has to be told what to do, what to think and that you never accept that your pastor can be wrong, assuming it is somewhat exaggerated to give this movie a 3/10 so that's why I'll give a 4/10 better."

","Two disclaimers: 1. I prefer Marvel(I collected Iron Man comics into my early 20s) and 2.

It appears I'm one of the few people that actually enjoyed Batman v. Superman.
Anyways here's my 2 cents:<br/><br/>Plot: like many others have mentioned it felt far too similar to Avengers (otherworldly devices opening portals, bug demons rather than aliens, a god-like supervillain). I would have thought they'd go out of their way to avoid this, but apparently not.<br/><br/>Characters: <br/><br/>Batman: he felt a lot less badass in this one than BvS. Maybe this was because of all the powerful allies around him.<br/><br/>Wonderwoman: She remained the same from her solo movie and she might be the only actor that got their character ""right"".<br/><br/>Aquaman: after all the disrespect this character has taken (from Family Guy to Big Bang Theory) it seemed like they tried too hard to make him a badass.<br/><br/>Cyborg: very flat. His suit dictating some of actions seemed kind of silly.<br/><br/>Flash: far too boy scout-ish. Obviously the comic relief.<br/><br/>Superman: probably the second best acted character in the movie. His rebirth was actually kind of cool (I know most hated it) but I agree with another reviewer that he should have stayed dead for a few movies. <br/><br/>Steppenwolf: quite possibly the worst villain they could have chosen. He's the Loki with no personality and his references to ""mother"" and Darkseid make no sense to casual movie goers.<br/><br/>Synopsis: it's not a horrible movie just a horrible movie in this series IMO. Maybe the next WW movie and the Aquaman movie bring life back to this franchise."

","I feel that DC is in a bit of a difficult position being so late to the party after The Avengers. The bar has been set quite high and Marvel has the clear advantage of having established itself first. It seems to me that DC is trying to establish it's own voice steering away from accusations of copying Marvel. The Dark Knight Trilogy is clearly their compass in this regard. A hard act to follow indeed.
 Reviewers have suggested that solo films would have been a better way to introduce the characters but I think that this would only draw unfavourable comparisons to Marvel. I may be wrong but this is the assumption that I am making.
 That being said, I think the chemistry between the leads was viable enough to warrant further exploration. I had a couple of groans at the beginning (only two) but this was more than made up for by the amount of 'wow cool' moments later on.
 Given the constraints of having so much material to have to cram into one film, the final product was one that I would recommend. I have no doubt that I will watch this again at some point in the future.
 Whereas I agree with some of the points made by other reviewers: somewhat rushed introductions; generic bad guy; sombre tone, I came away from this film genuinely looking forward to another installment."

","Dear WB, please take some lessons from the success of 'Avengers: Infinity War'. My prime takeaway:
(1) Do not be afraid to tell a story of more than 2 hours. If the story is good, people will watch it again and again in Cinema halls. Period!
(2) Do not mess up the storytelling so bad, that the villain's motive is not at all clear or relatable to the audience
(3) Do not mess up the storytelling so bad, that the main characters are not properly developed 
(4) To ensure points 1, 2, & 3 are properly addressed, keep your under-qualified studio executives (including the Head) from making creative decisions. The decisions & assumptions they made regarding cutting down the movie to below 2 hours - they were totally wrong, which has been proved by 'Infinity War'. The studio executives could not understand the audience pulse or the market, and thus they proved themselves under-qualified for the job. Fire the whole team!
(5) Don't try to play a short term 'catch-up game' with Marvel. Each of their major characters got at least one movie to tell their story. That's your homework. Do that properly! Make a WW type 'self-contained' movie for each of your main players, then come to the game with Marvel. Play the long game. Don't throw in your strong assets (heroes like Batman, Superman, The Flash) cheaply like you did in Justice League. Play the long game. Build each character, THEN put them together. 
In summary: keep patience, play the long game, give directors creative freedom to tell a self-contained story, and fire the whole bunch of meddling studio executives including their head honcho - they failed!!!"

","Justice League is a fun, non risky, movie with linear and easy to follow story. 
The story goes as follows, an ancient alien conqueror called Steppenwolf visited earth a long long time ago to, well, conquer it with the help of his army of parademons and his three teraforming devices called motherboxes but was defeated by the alliance of men, atlantians and amazons. Each tribe took one of the boxes for safe guarding. Now after the death of Superman, Steppenwolf has returned to recover his boxes and finish the job.
First let's talk about the pros of the movie. Most of the cinematography is great to watch, especially when the awfully bad CGI reshoots are absent. The heroes have a fluent enough chemistry, for a first team up, and they were all portrayed adequately by their casting choices ( except for Batman and Superman, because sometimes they felt like completely different characters to BvS). The fights were very good with some good choreography when it came to wonder Woman. Flash's use of the speed force was top notch and gave his powers a certain feel we've long wanted for our scarlet speedster. Superman's resurrection was handled pretty well and his fights with and against the team were amazing. Cyborg acted both as a heroe and a plot device for the movie and his role I think was the most important next to the trinity. His CGI, contrary to common opinion, was fantastic as well as his weaponry. And finally the backstory of Steppenwolf was shown excellently and on point, considering it was his first appearance ever on screen, and covered everything a non fan needed to know to follow the movie. His strikes when he was fighting felt powerful and you could feel how threatening he was. Especially when he was threatening and killing civilians and Amazons. 
Now about the cons. First of all, the reshoots and the CGI in them where horribly noticeable and drew you away from the consistency of the film. Speaking of consistency, the whole feel of the movie made like it wasn't a continuation of the previous instalments in the DCEU which ruined most of the backstory, in a way. Another problem of the movie was the overused humour. I know superhero movies are supposed to be fun but not necessarily funny, and certainly not when it comes to the end of the world and extinction of the human kind. Also, humour is not suitable for some characters like batman, who are sacrastic and cocky at best. Batman in BvS was an old, broken down Bruce Wayne, adrift from his moral code, all around a brutal murdering machine. But in this movie his throwing jokes, enjoys the return of superman like they were old pals and can't keep up in a fight with ONE parademon. It was disappointing at best. Aquaman on the other hand, while he was badass, he felt a bit underused. With his powers being limited only to super strength in action. His trident was used only once and in order to stop a flood( pretty basic if you ask me). The Flash was a bit irritating at times but I could get by that considering he is just a kid figuring out his powers. Steppenwolf, when his design is taken into account, I think was pretty lame. Wearing some kind of medieval armour, yeeeah what an alien look(Sarcasm).
Overall, Justice League was a mediocre super hero movie and not as terrible as some will tell you it was. It's definitely worth watching as it is fun and fast paced in its combat sequences. What makes it feel bad for some people is the constant comparison with its elseworld counterpart, The Avengers, which was set up in a lot of previous films, so we were familiar with the characters and the villain's full backstory. Try viewing Justice League with an open mind and you'll have a fun time for sure."

","The first movie in the franchise Justice League. This film also may be linked with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. <br/><br/>We find Ezra Matthew Miller, who had a cameo in B.V.S. Dawn Of Justice getting a full role as ""The Flash"". Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Gal Gadot reprise their respective superhero roles. Joseph Jason Namakaeha Momoa also reprises his role as ""Aquaman"".<br/><br/>Plot in brief: Thousands of years ago, Steppenwolf and his legions of Parademons attempted to take over Earth with the combined energies of three Mother Boxes. They were foiled by a unified army that includes the Olympian Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, mankind, and the Green Lantern Corps. After repelling Steppenwolf's army, the Mother Boxes were separated and hidden in locations on the planet. In the present, mankind is in mourning over Superman, whose death triggers the Mother Boxes to reactivate and Steppenwolf's return to Earth in an effort to regain favor with his master, Darkseid. Steppenwolf aims to gather the artifacts to form ""The Unity"", which will destroy Earth's ecology and terraform it in the image of Steppenwolf's homeworld.<br/><br/>Verdict: This film is okay as a time-pass film and rewatchability is also decent. I personally disliked the actor chosen for the role of Flash. The rest of the cast is okay - Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot carry their weight as do Henry Cavill and Jason Momoa. Henry Cavill has really done a rigorous body building workout for his role as Superman. Special effects are the mainstay of comic book superhero films and here it doesn't disappoint. The sound-effects are also good. Zack Snyder could have directed differently, but he took the same generic route as most of his earlier movies."
"Milk_Tray_Guy","4","0","0","6 April 2018"," Frustratingly poor - and yet it could have been so good.
","I love DC, I have done since I was a child (more years ago than I care to admit) - so it really hurts to say what an almighty mess this movie is. Affleck, Gadot, Cavill, Momoa, Miller, and Fisher all do well considering what they ended up with. Each is a great fit for their character and in the right movie this League would shine - but this isn't that movie. I loved Man of Steel and Wonder Woman, and enjoyed Batman v Superman, but the tonal shift here and inconsistency from one scene to the next - an obvious result of the well-publicised director change for reshoots - jar so badly that the movie ends up looking as though it doesn't know what it wants to be. In addition, some of the CGI is really, really poor to the extent of genuinely looking unfinished. The animated movie Justice League: War (2014) tells basically the same story as Justice League, both heavily inspired by the New 52 comic arc Justice League: Origin (JLW is actually a direct adaptation), and whilst JLW may not resach the very top tier of DC animations it's still far better than JL. THIS is the first ever live-action, big-screen, star-studded Justice League movie - and it's heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Likeable and charismatic leads, some nice visuals that somehow survived the reshoot hatchet job, and the ghost of a good movie that you occasionally glimpse of out of the corner of your eye get this movie a 6/10. Without them it would rate a 4."

"tortureprawn","7","0","0","6 April 2018"," Judge for yourself
","I can't say I've ever bothered to review a film here before but I had to make the effort if only to add some positivity to the constant barrage of abuse this flick gets.
Now I love comic books movies and I'm neither a Marvel or DC purist of any description so I'm not biased in any way. There's something magical in seeing Batman and Superman share a scene much more so than any of the Marvel films yet (I'm waiting on a possible Spider-man and Deadpool crossover). I may be in the minority here but I personally think that Ben Affleck is the perfect Batman and Bruce Wayne. No-one has got it this right since Michael Keaton. The look of the dark knight is perfect and I'll be sad to see Bat-Fleck go. Henry Cavill has also done the same for Superman. In fact there were no characters here that felt that they didn't belong.
On the topic of other characters, The Flash? Brilliant! Would have liked to have seen a lot more of Aquaman though. Cyborg? I was not too familiar with him so didn't know what to expect. They did a nice job of explaining the backstory without dragging it out.
The film itself was a blast. Like I said, I'm no purist so personally I didn't care what they got right or wrong about the characters. I wanted a good film and that was exactly what I got. This kept me engrossed from start to finish and unfortunately it was over before I wanted it to.
I have known for some time not to trust reviews as I have loved some films that have been bashed by the media and fans alike. My advice to myself has always been to watch it and see how I feel. How do I feel after this? I feel DC have made a great flick and this is now something to build on.
My only gripe, my only frustration is how they handled Cavill's moustache. It was horrible, just horrible. For those not in the know, Cavill was obligated to keep a moustache for another project and was forbidden from shaving it off. The fix? Just cover it with CG. With the amazing things that can be done now, it was nothing short of a cinematic crime that they butchered the CG on this so bad. The result of this is that for 99% of the times Supes was onscreen if felt like watching an animated character plonked into a live action film.
This film isn't perfect, far from it. But it is a lot of fun. Some have said that it is a touch slow, I didn't think so. There was a balanced mix of action and plot building here. How bored would you be of a feature film with non stop action? There would be nothing to look forward to, nothing break it up. Where would the plot be?<br/><br/>My final thought though? Just watch it with no preconceptions (which may be hard). Forgive minor deviations from the comics and just loose yourself in the fantasy that we have loved for so very long. After all, isn't that what we all want in this type of flick?"
"MasterFantastic","8","0","0","6 April 2018"," Justice has come...sort of.
","I'll be honest. I was hoping for something that was cohesive, something that rocked the house like Wonder Woman...and it didn't happen. However, all is not lost. While the film had flaws--big ones--it was enjoyable enough for me to give it this reasonably high rating.<br/><br/>First, the bad news. The film is disjointed, as badly cut up as BvS's theatrical feature was. You can blame this on the writers or the studio executives or both; it doesn't matter. What matters is that the film looked like patchwork. I haven't seen the extended version--assuming that rumor is true--but it might be an improvement...might.<br/><br/>Point two is the lack of individual character buildup. I think most people know the origin stories of Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg, but here, they're reduced to a few lines of exposition to explain how they got that way. While Marvel did the smart thing, that being giving their superheroes their own origin flicks and then bringing all the heroes together, DC seems hellbent on just tossing in their heroes all at once. Bad strategy, IMO, and while it won't kill the franchise, it will limit them unless they change their thinking.<br/><br/>Now, to the good parts. The acting is excellent. Affleck is Batman and does a very credible Bruce Wayne, Jason Momoa reminds me of Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage--""ooooh, yeaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!""--and Ezra Miller as Flash is appropriately geeky/goofy. <br/><br/>All Gal Gadot has to do is to smile, but she gets her part. She KNOWS what being Wonder Woman is all about. At turns tough and sweet, she IS Wonder Woman. Ray Fisher as Cyborg is quietly effective, and really, there are no slackers, acting-wise or relating-wise. They play off each other perfectly. <br/><br/>Ciaran Hinds as the voice of Steppenwolf is also good. His character has always been sort of two-dimensional, but Hinds does well with it.<br/><br/>The action sequences are dynamic, and the music (by Danny Elfman) is effectively retro, with riffs from the Flash TV series and also the Batman movies of the late '80's and early '90's. All of these good points were enough for me to give the film a rating of seven. I know the DC faithful were/are disappointed. I was, too, but the fun factor was there for me, as well as the thrill of seeing the superheroes of my youth team up. I can only hope JL 2 will be worth it. Time will tell."

As he gains more power the six remaining members of the Justice League are trying hard but seem to be fighting a losing battle. They really need Superman but can they figure out a way to re-animate him? To bring him back alive?<br/><br/>Well as we know anything is possible in the comics.

"aquascape","8","0","0","2 April 2018"," DC needs to rethink its strategy
","DC's response to ""The Avengers"", ""Justice League"" should have been the film that would wash every unsuccessful attempt the gigantic comic book publisher ever displayed on-screen as a live-action superhero movie. Sadly, it just falls into the deep pit of every other work from the DC Cinematic Universe. 
I strongly believed in this movie before it came out, especially after the rave reviews of ""Wonder Woman"", this should have set a new ground in terms of quality for DC.<br/><br/>""Justice League"" centers around a team of superheroes formed by Batman, played by Ben Affleck, in order to stop the menacing force crowned as Steppenwolf. Batman enlists the help of other people with special abilities, such as Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman or Cyborg. Despite shaping up Earth's first line of defense, Steppenwolf withstands the mighty team. Now Batman is forced to find a new way to stop the menace and only one person could face up to the task at hand, Superman.<br/><br/>The plot is a classic comic-book story that feels to have entered a little late in the superhero genre. If the movie was developed and released in the early stages, pre-Iron Man era, then I would have given it a pass, but in this age of ever-pouring comic-book movies year by year, it just doesn't stand up to the standards.
Aside from the main story, the script has been revised by Joss Whedon who's hand was seen throughout the movie, giving it a lighter more comical touch. This was a slight improvement to the DC Universe, but not enough to save the movie.<br/><br/>Steppenwolf was really just a bland villain bringing absolutely nothing new to the table. The villain is an important part of the superhero movie process and they misfired once again after ""Suicide Squad"".<br/><br/>Instead of following the Marvel formula by having each individual superhero origin story told first and only then connecting the storyline unto one epic stage like the ""The Avengers"", DC rushed production by postponing several key characters' own films. There may have been slight hints in ""Batman vs Superman"" of The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman but not enough to make they're involvement aware to the audience. There is no true indication that Marvel's way is the only path to success and even so, DC still did not take the right approach.<br/><br/>The casting and acting was great, Ben Affleck does an amazing job as Bruce Wayne, probably the second best live-action Batman portrayal after Michael Keaton. Ezra Miller, Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa also fit well within their character's personalities.<br/><br/>""Justice League"" had serious development troubles with two months of re-shoots and script rewriting, not to mention Henry Cavill's digitally removed mustache.<br/><br/>Famed composer Hans Zimmer did not return to score the soundtrack after ""Batman Vs Superman"" and was replaced by Danny Elfman, who in one way or another brought back the enjoyable theme song from 89's ""Batman"". Elfman's work matched the pace of earlier parts of the movie very well, but in the latter half, just like the script, it started to not amount to anything.<br/><br/>I know that an 8/10 is a high rating, but even with all the above being said, I actually enjoyed the movie and I truly hope DC is going to learn from its mistakes and turn it all around with ""Justice League 2"". Marvel needs a big competitor and DC needs to step up its game."

In the first part, the movie is trying to be dark and serious, which frankly has become distracting and annoying. The second half has a lighter tone and jokes and the most action.<br/><br/>The movie however, has a few character flaws. The Flash is a little too awkward for my taste, since in the Justice League TV show he was quite a funny character. Batman, seems too tired and Wonder Woman is so hung up on her dead ex from her movie, that I had literally started rolling my eyes. Last but not least, the (as I know him from Teen Titans) fun but geeky Cyborg, has become a dark edgy character that honestly, I was annoying with.<br/><br/>While the last fight was pretty amusing, Superman showed up and turned it into a joke by practically beating Steppenwolf (Sorry if I mispelled) up so badly that the fight became a bit of a joke.<br/><br/>To conclude, as long as you don't mind te mixed direction and the fact that 3 known members are missing, you are going to enjoy the movie quite a lot."

Then came Wonder Woman and finally fans enjoyed what they saw. Now comes Justice League, a movie that failed to live up the hype at the box office and forced DC to change its plans on future DCEU films, such as those with Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg, et al. This movie, which runs at a brisk 2 hours yet feels a bit slow, has some pretty good set pieces but overuses CGI too much, leaving the story to be muted. After what happened the last time Superman was around, he returns in grandiose fashion, resurrected by his superfriends on a mission to defeat Stepphenwolf from taking over Metropolis. I hope WB releases the snyder version of the movie, since Joss Whedon took over after the original director left due to his daughter's passing of a suicide. The result is a mish mash of things."
"cutesd","6","0","0","29 March 2018"," It wasn't horrible ...
","I've definitely seen superhero mashups be worse. Mostly this just felt like a not-as-good-Avengers. <br/><br/>The thing with superhero mashups is that there isn't a lot of time for character development. Characters can have arcs but they have to be small ones so we need to know the characters beforehand so we can care about them. So DC messed up in that we only really knew Superman and Wonder Woman. We knew a little about Batman from the Batman vs Superman movie but not really. So that's half the characters we have absolutely no history with when this film starts ... that's a lot of gaps to fill.<br/><br/>Justice League tries, but the characters all feel flat even the ones who previously had stories and personalities. I'm not sure what happened but we get zero development, zero personality ... just deadpan performances all the way around. <br/><br/>Add to that, pretty terrible CGI. <br/><br/>Then there's fact that Superman makes the rest of them seem useless. I thought the Flash was supposed to be faster than Superman? I thought Wonder Woman was supposed to share Superman's level of strength? Batman seems especially useless in this film ... like he gets them all together but he's old and clunky in his suit and can't fight worth a damn. <br/><br/>Aquaman I just don't get. He lives in the water ... there's some jokes that he talks to fish ... he's strong? But we don't get to see him flex his water muscles, he does most of his fighting on land, he's got his trident thing but he basically just uses it as a pitch fork. So I don't get it. <br/><br/>And as soon as Superman shows up it looks as though he could've single-handedly taken out the big bad. Like he wasn't working hard at all which made the defeat of Steppenwolf extremely unsatisfying.<br/><br/>So yeah ... not awful but just kind of meh."

","Had the story been fleshed out, with greater character development, with Bruce Wayne having to work harder at first finding each new character and struggling to persuade them to join his League, then we would have had more invested in the story. Instead Mr Affleck looks too nonchalant nay complacent, uncommitted to his role and as such ruins the authenticity required to suspend our disbelief. Such a shame really because the choreography of the fight scenes were particularly well done. Equally Cavill and Adams look a little lost in reprising their roles and seem to have been struggling to capture how they had performed in the first two iterations, while the continuity of the cinematography/lighting and texture of the film doesn't reflect the first two. Such a shame as it loses the sense that this was supposed to be a continuum of the same universe in which these characters exist."

","Review:
If this is DC's attempt to challenge Marvel, they done a very bad job! After the poor Batman vs. Superman, I thought that the DC comics production team would have gone back to the drawing board with this movie but they made another mediocre action flick, without giving any of the superheroes any depth. They really need to take a leaf out of Marvels book, by adding loads of humour, which seemed to work in the latest Thor movie, and Deadpool. With that aside, the action scenes were pretty impressive, and it was good to see the superheroes battling together but I still was expecting more from the first DC Justice League movie. Anyway, this film sees Batman (Ben Affleck), joining forces with Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), to put together a superhero team to takedown the evil Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds), who is trying to gather 3 precious artefacts that are hidden on earth. After battling in Amazon, were Wonder Woman was born, Steppenwolf manages to retrieve the first box, so there leader, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) sends a message to earth, hoping that Wonder Woman will know how much danger earth is in. After Batman tries to recruit Aquaman (Jason Momoa) to create a new super group, Steppenwolf steals the second artefact from the sea, which forces Aquaman to join forces with the others. Batman then recruits the Flash (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), and they manage to find the 3rd artefact, which helps them to bring Superman back to life. Believe it or not! Anyway, with all of them on board, they put together a plan to kill Steppenwolf, who manages to steal the 3rd artefact from them but his powers are way too much for the Justice League. The storyline wouldn't have been too bad, if the characters had some form of a background, and I really didn't think that Ben Affleck played Batman that well, especially after Christopher Nolan's great interpretation of the superhero. The Flash also wasn't in the same league as Quicksilver, who has the same type of super powers, and the Cyborg and Aquaman could have been much better. Superman did show his true powers, when he was battling against his fellow team mates and Steppenwolf but I still think that the movie could have been much better if they added some decent wit. Anyway, I wasn't that impressed with the movie, and the ending, with Lex Luther and Deadshot, didn't make the next movie that promising. Average! <br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Zack Snyder, 52, who also brought you Dawn of the Dead, the great 300, Watchmen, Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole, Sucker Punch, the poor Man Of Steel and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. As he was resposinsible for killing of Superman in Batman v Superman, I think that he realised that he made a big mistake, which is why he came up with that ridiculous resurrection in this movie. His poor storytelling methods destroyed the Superman franchise, and I'm surprised to see that he is returning to direct another Justice League movie, after this poor attempt. Audiences usually look forward to seeing a movie about the individual super heroes but I'm not that interested in seeing a film about any of the other Justice League, except for another Wonder Woman movie as the first one was quite entertaining. It will be interesting to see how they are going to introduce the Green Lantern, who was another important superhero in the Justice League but after the terrible job that they done with the movie starring Ryan Reynolds, they really need to give that character a serious reboot. There is rumours about an Aquaman movie later on this year, along with Shazam, with Dwayne Johnson playing the villain Black Adam. Later on next year there should be another Wonder Woman movie and Suicide Squad 2, which should hopefully be better than the first movie. Batman should also be making another stand alone movie, and Justice League Dark, Batgirl, Green Lantern Corps, The Flash: Flashpoint, Justice League 2, Cyborg, Nightwing, Man Of Steel 2, Gotham City Sirens, Deadshot, Black Adam and Sandman are also on the cards to boost the DC comic book movie franchise but as it takes so long for these movies to be produced, I doubt that I'll be alive to see them all.<br/><br/>Budget: $300million
Worldwide Gross: $658million<br/><br/>Genre: Action, Adventure, Fantasy
Cast: Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, J.K. Simmons, Joe Morton, Amber Heard, Ciaran Hinds, David Thewlis and Michael EcElhatton. 5/10"

The story simply made for kids, simple storyline with no element of surprise, no thrill, average comedy, unnecessary scenes (plain Russian family), even the special effect is not special at all.<br/><br/>Good to see Superman is alive though, he can pull out the Superman we have and love from comics, but the others are plain, poor Wonder Woman, she has no enough stage for her, lousy Batman, he can have more limelight, boring Cyborg. Aquaman and Flash are OK anyway, they are like the ice cream in the dessert for this pack.<br/><br/>I sadly have to give 5/10 for this movie, hurts..... :(. And what a waste for a 300MM movies."

","I'm genuinely surprised this movie didn't perform as well as expected. Sure there were a few raised eyebrows throughout and some beats being skipped but I suspect that was more to do with studio meddling in the cut than anything. <br/><br/>I really appreciated the dynamic of the characters and actually felt like there wasn't the same sense of inevitability about the team winning like in the Avengers. <br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed Superman and Cyborg's arcs and would have loved to have seen more about their stories in the plot development. <br/><br/>Aquaman was great but I felt like they were trying too hard to take him away from his stigmatised appearance in the comics. Some of his one-liners were a little cringeworthy and unnecessary given how his actions proved his worth time and again. <br/><br/>I was also pleased that, in spite of their much more sexualised outfits compared to the WW outing, the Amazons and WW herself were portrayed with the same dignity as before. <br/><br/>The Flash was great, I thought they nailed him well and Ezra Miller did a far better version of him than Grant Gustin. <br/><br/>I sincerely hope that another JL is rolled out and the story arc is continued."

","This movie had potential to throw lot on screen.<br/><br/>The villain of this movie sucks. He is not characterized. They say the mother box was not calling him because of Super man, but now it call because he is dead. Super man was on the Earth for few years only.The villain from X-Men: Apocalypse is far better than this.<br/><br/>Batman has not super powers, but he is the leader and no strong scenes for him. In BvS, Batman had the vision of Flash call him and the vision of fighting against the bugs was raising expectations about this movie, but nothing went well.<br/><br/>Man of steel and BvS tried to show Super man has a normal super hero (but he is not). Now they try to upraise him. I am 80's kid I know only Super man and He-Man as super hero. DC failed to show Super Man as he is.<br/><br/>Main flaw is, how Super man is reborn, it was happening just like that. We where expecting some emotional touch over there. Wonder woman, Flash and Cyborg give some relaxation. Still the antagonist is too week."

"thatchermacdonald","5","0","0","18 March 2018"," Average visuals & average writing = average comic book movie
","I have to agree with common sentiment in that this movie could have been much more, but a combination of over-diluted writing lacking focus, poor CGI, and contrived dialogue that failed to compensate for other shortcomings equals a comic book movie that comes up noticeably short relative to all the others made in recent history. <br/><br/>Writing-- I think the writers fail to effectively bring the individual super heroes and respective story lines together in this one-- not so much a product of poor writing as it is a byproduct of having too much material with which to work. In particular, the current Superman and Batman, and to a lesser extent Wonder Woman, have very extensive backgrounds and story lines that have been intricately chronicled in several films. Similar to the Avengers, the ability to write all these respective stories into one film and to effectively incorporate such an overwhelmingly large amount of material into one cohesive script is asking a lot. It appears that the writers of Justice League struggle with this daunting task as it feels like the material from different movies is thrown together, coming off disconnected and distracting. <br/><br/>CGI-- While Zack Snyder's style is uniquely tied to CGI and offers beautifully mesmerizing experiences, it appears that this movie just got too comfortable with digit effects. It goes without saying that Superman's CGI face was extremely confusing and distracting. The Snyder-esk action scenes are already heavily dependent on special effects, but even these scenes seemed too animated as they were quick-framed and tough to follow. The slow-motion Flash and Superman portions were the best because they provided more detail and time to digest.<br/><br/>Finally, the dialogue was just not quite there. A lot of short, one-liner type exchanges lacking substance and emotion. <br/><br/>Not sure if this movie suffered from budget issues or other production-related problems, but it definitely came across as a very AVERAGE comic book movie on my end."

","I felt there wasn't more to the movie than just hopping from action scene to action scene, in order to show off some CGI. The CGI is top notch, but with very few exceptions overall just lacks originality, just like the musical score, which isn't anything special. It's same old, same old Hollywood and it definitely is getting old. <br/><br/>Story-wise, there isn't much to Justice League either; a pretty generic ""defeat the villain"" story, with a pretty generic villain.<br/><br/>The heroes are mostly known to us and they are just doing what they do in order to move on to the next scene. The new heroes hardly add anything new and interesting to the table and seem to be on screen only to get us warm and ready for some spin-off movies.

","This movie with all its hype failed to deliver on many levels. <br/><br/>What defined a good Superhero movie is the villain. Steppenwolf had such a small part of this movie and the storyline spent more time trying to develope a back story for Auquama and the cube that took away from the movie itself. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck's performance as Batman was much improved from BvS and the comic relief of Ezra Miller Jason Momoa are about the only good things in this movie. <br/><br/>We have to wait until almost the end of the movie before we see the return of Superman, something we already knew was going to happen from the after credits scene in BvS. Combine that with the fact that this movie wasn't even 2 hours long they definitely could have given more story time to Superman, Wonder Woman and Aquaman. <br/><br/>To sum up, movie didn't live up to all the hype because it was too short, had a sucky villain, and storyline needed to be developed more. If this movie was the length of Man of Steel or BvS and had a better villain this could have been a much better movie."

","Thought Superman was dead? Well, this film brings him back to life by a company of dazzlingly brilliantly costumed actors - a fine cast who seem to take the whole adventure too seriously - and a director (Zach Snyder) that prefers CGI wowzers to storytelling, perhaps because of the screenplay pasted together by a cast of eleven (count 'em, 11!) writers. But comic book heroes continue to sell well and keep the theaters full - very possibly because these noisy action packed movies are a way to escape the realities of the world in which we live. <br/><br/>The 'plot' is well summarized - Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince (Gal Gadot), to face an even greater enemy. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to find and recruit a team of metahumans to stand against this newly awakened threat. But despite the formation of this unprecedented league of heroes-Batman (Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and The Flash (Ezra Miller) -it may already be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions. Amidst all the explosions, flying beasties, Amazons, and the evil Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciarán Hinds) up rises Superman (a very buff bare-chested Henry Cavill) and his usual entourage (Diane Lane, Amy Adams) and with the help of J.K. Simmons, Jeremy Irons et al, everything is simply OK again ....maybe.... there will never be an end (or need) for superheroes.<br/><br/>For lovers of the comic book realm this one will please. Big on CGI (excellent) and not so much on story."

"santiagomace","6","0","0","17 March 2018"," A mess
","This film is a easily the worst entry of the DCEU. Yes, I think it is worse than the decent Batman v Superman (talking about Ultimate Edition, of course) and the mediocre Suicide Squad. <br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film is that it doesn't feel like it's from the same world as Batman v Superman or Man Of Steel. There is about one week between Batman v Superman and Justice League, and suddenly Bruce doesn't hate the world, loves everyone... and makes jokes. ""I heard you can talk to fish"" was something I could stand, but ""Yep, there's something certainly bleeding"" was just terrible. Also, in the three DCEU films set in the present day, the military and the government play big roles, here they just don't exist. Apart from some cops during Superman's resurrection, there isn't a single military force involved in anything related to the film. This is probably because of the reshoots or because of the runtime limit (I'll get to that). <br/><br/>Then, the story. Batman has restored the faith in humanity after Superman's heroic act, so, with the help of Wonder Woman, he recruits a team of meta humans to fight an alien threat coming from far away. Batman v Superman's Ultimate Edition had this scene where we get a glimpse of Steppenwolf, Justice League's villain. Except, of course, that BvS' Steppenwolf, with only two seconds of screen time, leaves a better impression than the PS3 character we got in Justice League. He only talks to himself, telling to the audience his plans, and he has some weird obsessions with mothers. He spends the whole movie speaking to and about the mother boxes, mother and the unity, which is formed by the three mother boxes. A lot of mothers. Oh, and don't forget the fact that he looks different than in his first appearance. Then, the story makes no sense. We don't know where the mother boxes come from, what they exactly do, and why they are so powerful. If it is such a huge risk to keep them in normal places, where they could suddenly awake, why don't they just destroy them? There are plenty of plot holes like this. The pacing makes no sense, it jumps from one action scene to another without taking its time to breath. And because Steppenwolf is so bad, I'll talk more about him. What is exactly his plan? If you know the comics, you know he is one of the New Gods, Darkseid's most trusted general, etc. You also know that his mission is terraforming the earth to make it like Darkseid's world. We get a glimpse of this in the ""Knoghtmare"" sequence of Batman v Superman. However, if you know nothing, all you know is that he is from far away, that he loves mother and that he is some blue guy, which makes him the most generic villain a DC Film has ever had. I'd dare to say he is even worse than Mr Freeze. And the CGI they used for him is just TERRIBLE, which brings me to my next point. <br/><br/>Oh, the special effects... where do I start with this? It is a 300 million dollar film, yet it feels and looks like a made for TV holiday special. Many scenes are oversaturated and have too much colour, other scenes have some of the worst green screen I've ever seen, and Steppenwolf looks like some villain from a bad 2007 video game. All of this, if I'm right, is because of the reshoots. <br/><br/>Where do I start with them, too? Zack Snyder, who directed the divisive Man Of Steel and the misunderstood Batman v Superman, had completed principal photography and filmed all the scenes, and even completed the VFX for some of them, when her daughter committed suicide. This logically made him step out of the project, and WB hired Joss Whedon, who had already signed with them for a Batgirl movie, to write and direct some reshoots. Why? Well, some people say the Snyder cut was unwatchable, and some say it was because what Snyder had done continued the gritty style introduced in Man Of Steel, so Joss was supposed to light it up. The thing is that apart from lighting up the tone, he literally lighted up some scenes, to the point of oversaturating night scenes to make them look like day scenes (Superman's resurrection is a good example of this). He also scrapped most of Superman's scenes and reshoot them all. How do we know this? Well, because the visual effects team had little time to finish the CGI before the release of the film, so some inconvenient things happened with Henry Cavill's face. While they filmed the reshoots, he was filming the new Mission: Impossible film, and a part of his contract with Paramount said that he couldn't shave his beard and moustache; and WB took the brilliant decision of removing it with visual effects. The problem, however, is that his upper lip looks extremely bad and clumsily done and part of his face looks blurry. <br/><br/>And finally, the score. When Joss Whedon (who, BTW, directed Avengers and its sequel) came on the project, he fired the brilliant Junkie XL, who had worked with Hams Zimmer on the BvS score, and decided to replace him with the once brilliant Danny Elfman. And for some reason, Elfman decided to take all the musical continuity of the DCEU away and replace Hans Zimmer's Flight with John Williams theme for Christopher Reeve's Superman, A Beautiful Lie with his own theme for 1989's Batman, and Is She With You? With a bastardisation of the theme. All of this, combined with the rest of uninspired themes, leave us with one of the most generic scores in recent super hero films. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Justice League is a convoluted mess, a Frankenstein film made by two different directors with two different styles, that doesn't know what it wants to be and breaks its own universe's bit of continuity."

Would have been nice for Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman to have had their own movies prior to Justice League but hey... I hear they're working on it.<br/><br/>The story didn't really have any depth, its your typical bad guy wanting to take over the world and become more powerful while Bruce Wayne tries to assemble the Justice League team. Plenty of cheesy lines and predictability throughout. I felt that the pacing of the movie was too fast and next thing I knew, the movie was over. There was little to no backstory to the main villain so I didn't care for him either.<br/><br/>Over all, Justice League was just an average eye-candy popcorn flick. It is nowhere near the level of The Dark Knight trilogy... but it isn't the worse movie I've ever seen either.<br/><br/>I hope WB works on developing these characters much better for future movies, along with penning a script with more depth, to avoid failure should a sequel be made."

In Justice League there are 5 heroes and that does not work at all.
But it could have worked but the biggest flaw is the storyline which is really terrible and idiotic.
Three separate boxes, when united, can destroy the world????
And this is what the villain Steppenwolf want to do. He has superpowers but does not stand a change at all when Superman appears again after he is raised from the death (what???).
Come on: the storywriters in Hollywood make loads of money but can't come up with a better story than this? Maybe they used to much of the white powder and can't think straight anymore? It looks like a five years old child came up with this story....

","Okay, let me just start off by saying, I am a big Batman fan. Whenever a new movie comes out that features the Caped Crusader, the old comic book fan in me gets really excited. But, as I have grown up and seen, superhero movies, Zack Snyder ones specifically, often leave me feeling very unsatisfied. After the, for lack of a better term, disaster that was Batman vs. Superman, it left a bad taste in the mouths of critics and most fans. Even though Ben Affleck's portrayal of Batman was fantastic, the rest of the movie is just downright BAD. Leading into Justice League, there was a lot of skepticism. In short, I think this movie is an absolute turd to the superhero genre and cinema period. No, I am not a critic being paid by Marvel, I am just an avid cinema fan who enjoys good movies. This movie fails at almost every level: storytelling, characters, editing, pacing, and even CGI. Steppenwolf is just another grey villain to add to the catalog for the DCEU, he is not intimidating whatsoever. During the climax of the film, my friend and I started laughing during the whole ""big-CGI-destruction"" on the town or wherever they were, because it was just so flat out ridiculous and stupid. I also thought the whole Henry Cavil mustache being CGI'd out was just awful, yet hilarious. The only thing I can say that was somewhat ""good"" was Jeremy Iron's Alfred, he was very charming and likable. It's a problem when the most likable character in this six-hero team-up film, is a side character butler. Quick side note, what is it with Zack Snyder constantly zooming in on Gal Gadot's butt? The film is a disaster, re-shoots really doomed this ""film"" even more than it was already doomed. I honestly would rather watch BvS then this colossal waste of time and money.

","This review could have been written in 2 ways: 1 Evaluating it as a stand alone movie 2. Considering now the multiple cinematic universes, this one part of DC, established 1st by Fox with X Men and now consolidated and ruled by Disney and Marvel with Avengers... Only if you live in a cave it is inevitable that you have not seen or heard of any movie of it. I do think the 2nd option is more fun.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie. Ok, Marvel has dne a fantastic job making more familiar some hreores that were not that familiar and building the only solid cinematic universe, they have taken their time and will celebrate the 10th Anniv of that universe with Infinity War... But let's face it: DC has great super heroes, many of us grew up with their cartoons, comic books, movies or tv series; and watching them together in a movie is a 1st good reason to watch it.<br/><br/>Is Justice League funny? Yes. Is there chemistry within the actors? Yes. Are the battles and special effects good?. Yes. Did all the JL memebres shine the same? No. Was the realease a little bit rushed? Maybe. But let's talk about some aspects of the movie:<br/><br/>The rythm is oog, I did not get bored at any time. Maybe the movies Man of Steel , Batman VS Superman and even Wonder Woman had some slow paced scenes. But this one is fast paced and funny, all the time we get something new and fresh.<br/><br/>The Justice League Team: I think the main challenge was to get all the heroes together and make it in a credible and, at the same time, not boring way. For some that are more familiar with this characters it dwould not be a problem, but maybe for new generations, now adapted to Marvel Movies and being introduced with each super heroe at their own movie, seeing all this super heroes is not that magical. But érsonally, I do think that it is great to see them and we really get a team with chemistry, seeing them woorking together with their abilities gives a lot fun to the movies and some good actions sequences.<br/><br/>1st we get to see Wonder Woman / Gal Gadott. She had her sucessful stand alone movie before and was pretty good. Now we see some hints about that movie and also we have a more mature character (there is a gap of almost 100 years between the movies) that now has to come out of exile to save the world.<br/><br/>Batman: I think Ben Affleck as Batman is fine, maybe we have not seen a lot from him and sometimes his character seems out of place. But it is understandable because of all the Batman incarnations throughthe years, present his origins and previous adventures woudl be too much. So if you relax and remember that no matter the actor you already now the Dark Night story, then you can sit and relax. Something I appreciated was to hear again Danny Elfam Batman theme.<br/><br/>We have Flash and Cyborg, the younger crew. Flash, Ezra Miller was very funny and nerdy, a very likeable character. We workds like Spider Man for the Avengers but Flash seems more integrated to the team. Cyborg, Ray Fisher, was pretty good, the special effects with his suit wre great and watching a half human half robot dealing with his changes was presented in a way that you can like the character. The movie delivers some backstory of Flash and Cyborg in a way that you know them and do not get bored in the way.<br/><br/>I have some complains with Aquaman. Altough Jason Momoa does a good job I do not think he really shined at any moment. There are some good special effects underwater, but he never uses a special hability or power . I know he will have his own movie but his part here could have been better.<br/><br/>And Superman, Henry Cavill, -spoilers if they are not obvious enough - is back. I thought his ""resurrection"" was going to be more epic but it was not that bad seeing him all confused and in battle with this friends. Also, he could have become a much more darker character, but maybe the ""boy scout"" mood is requierd to contrast Batman. Also, we never get to see what happens outside the world and what does it says about his comeback. Super heroes seem to be in an alternate world aside, something that is happening too to the Marvel Movies, where the real world and the people that claims the help of super heroes feel more alienated.<br/><br/>The vilain, Steppenwolf, his motives and the Boxes of Power... Impossible not to compare it with the gems from the Avengers. And this is where the movie looks precipitated. We ara introduced to this boxes that even try to connect tohe sotries of our characters. Was it a bad resource? No, but this just proves that DC Universe was built trying to have the success of Marvel's Avengers. I just hope that now DC realizes that they have the best super heroes (Yes, Marvel I am sorry) and that DC can do good movies with their own formula (Good Wonder Womand and Justice League, Please burry Suicide Squad and Man of Steel)<br/><br/>In the end Justice League is a fun movie, with a good team, good chemistry between actors and some good actiions sequences.I would definitely recommend it and watch it again. 8 / 10"

","Man of Steel was awful (although interesting and I liked General Zod and co's costumes). Since Justice League had the same director I thought it too would more or less suck but was pleasantly surprised. The things that annoyed me in Man of Steel e.g. having my senses assaulted with high speed zooms and basically not being able to tell what was going on at times, and its stupidity e.g. as if no one would've heard Clark Kent smash up a truck... thankfully Justice League was mostly free from these sorts of annoyances. Justice League was a visual treat; surprisingly cinematic/good photography. Justice League is leave your brain at the door entertainment; call me a simpleton, but I like movies that are easy to follow; where I don't have to rack my brain trying to work out what it's about (unlike movies such as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy where I had absolutely no idea wtf was going on). And the production design in Justice League was good. Justice League wasn't brilliant but worth seeing."

","Super-hero film crossovers have flourished since the first ""Avengers"" film, combining the universes of the most popular comic-book heroes known (like Hulk and Iron Man). ""Justice League"" has imitated this with, virtually, the same storyline (saying that, they're all virtually the same) where the world is powerless to this seemingly invincible alien invasion, only to hopefully be saved for those few gifted individuals...except for Batman, who is just rich. <br/><br/>Written by Chris Terrio (writer of ""Argo"") and Joss Whedon (who co-wrote ""The Avengers"") have produced a mediocre, recognisable script (alien invasion and what not) but, unlike ""The Avengers"", this film didn't have the superheroes or acting talent needed to create something of that quality despite the characters' potential. The Flash is an interesting hero, having the power of super-speed, produced by DC, but his character comes across as almost unnecessary and powerless some of the time. Not only that, Cyborg's CGI-ed body is poorly executed in scenes, Aquaman is obnoxious (which, paired with cringe-dialogue, gets tiresome), and Batman is the weakest of the lot, when he should be (not necessarily the strongest, physically) not having to reuse the enemies weapons. That's just low and sad, especially for Batman. Even worse for the film's reputation is what it must resort to to stop an powerful alien who just wants to destroy the universe. <br/><br/>DC has the heroes capable of standing up to the likes of Marvel, and, despite the lacking optimism of the 2011 film adaptation, Green Lantern would have made a great contribution to the film. But, this predictable, mediocre story makes the five heroes seem utterly hopeless, save Wonder Woman, who is the the only one who actually manages to show a little power, just watch the way The Flash runs, but, saying that, it is still entertaining and watchable."

I thought it had a strong start, and as someone who is not that familiar with the Justice League world, the introduction of each character was exactly what I needed. I think the directors did a good job giving the viewer enough backstory to build a solid understanding and emotional connection with each member despite the limited time on screen. Not an easy task.<br/><br/>The bad guy aspect was mediocre and stereotypical of a super hero movie; there is nothing special about a supernatural villain wanting to destroy the world. The excitement for this movie came from the Justice League team itself, and their interpersonal interactions, challenges, and eventual success. The return of Superman was exciting, and I found his conflict with Bruce Wane to be genuine in the way it played out. The conversations between Bruce Wanye and Wonder Woman needed a bit more work, and it felt as if the editing failed to bring out their intentions.<br/><br/>Overall I though the movie was exciting, fun to watch, and left me hopeful for future DC movies.

","Justice League: the 5th movie from DC (Warner Bros) and they're 3rd 'team' movie. The world is in danger from a big CGI guy (Steppenwolf) and his faceless hoard (Parademons), so a team must be quickly formed. Very quickly.<br/><br/>Justice League went through so much production hell its a miracle it works as well as it does. For those that don't know: the director Zack Snyder basically finished filming and had to pull out of editing due to personal tragedy. So Joss Whedon was brought in to edit and direct the reshoots. Not only are these two directors styles complete opposites but Warner Bros put a strict time limit on JL; it could not got over a 2 hour run time. Constricting and stifling any background or character backstories to a minimum. Cyborg (Ray Fisher) is titular to the films plot but little is really revealed... He's essentially a big USB. With this time limit every aspect feels rushed- the 'we can't stay in the same place for more than 2 minutes' kinda rush; which is where you can kinda see that JL was directed by 2 people. Scenes don't flow together well and feel more like a collection of clips. This might come as a bit of a surprise but the villain was not very good. Try as they might Steppenwolf was not an overly effective threat nor did he have much presence despite being built up as a menace.<br/><br/>But putting the problems to one side Justice League has fun moments and shows promise, it's also an incredibly easy watch (that could mean it ends up forgettable however). The characters personas are good and, mostly, work together. I just wish I saw more of that and less ""quick we got fight that big dude"". The actors are good; Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) and Ben Affleck (Batman) are on mark and still super enjoyable. The new characters, although underdeveloped still showed their potential. And Henry Cavill has given his best portrayal of Superman yet. Though during the reshoots Cavill was filming Misson Impossible and had a mustache which needed to be edited out off JL, which is noticeable at times. Nothing severe but you can tell that's not a real upper lip.<br/><br/>Justice League has some story and pacing issues but nonetheless this is definitely a step in the right direction for the franchise which hopefully carrys forward. It would've been nice to see several other films prior to this to set things up a bit better. And Warner Bros definitely need to take a step back; thus far all major issues with the DC cinematic universe can be traced back to the executives.<br/><br/>I give Justice League a C+"

","You would have thought with the likes of Batman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg,
The Flash and Aquaman holding it up this movie couldn't possibly sink.
Right? Wrong.<br/><br/>Despite the effort of DC Comics A-Team (minus Superman) the film
collapses under the weight of its own plot and sinks without a trace
dragging it's underdeveloped characters down with it. This film is an
improvement on Batman Vs Superman Vs Common Sense, however, its a step
backwards from the very good Wonder Woman stand alone film. <br/><br/>The problems are numerous; the most obvious being the films troubled
production seeping into the final product. The film feels rushed and
lacks polish and even Joss Whedon's magic touch has deserted him here.
The light relief has been crow barred in and is forced rather than
natural. Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot sleep walk through the events of the
film and the more interesting characters of Cyborg and The Flash are
left on the sidelines without exploration. And I wouldn't say it to his
face but the less said about Jason Momoa's Aquaman the better (good
luck with the stand alone film - you're going to need it!).<br/><br/>Despite this there are small ledges of hope for the executives of
Warner Bros to cling on to. As already mentioned Cyborg and The Flash
might have traction and the failure of this film at the box office
might force said executives to re-think the whole DC universe to the
benefit of everyone. <br/><br/>I can't conclude this review without mentioning the villain.
Steppenwolf (who I hear you ask?) is a lesson in how not to do CG
characters and the ending is ridiculous and we are left pondering the
question; what is the point of Justice League?<br/><br/>What is the point indeed?"

","I think Warner Brothers is the problem. Its very clear that its not the actors or the director. Its the studio. DC has stood on its own for decades with Comics, the best animated series/movies of any superheros, video games, and TV Series. So its not DC its the studio. They studio want to direct with the directors believing that they got their positions by being creative directors. You got your jobs from knowing the business. <br/><br/>They rushed the story line and I blame the CEO for a stupid mandate. I'm glad it backfired. You now know fans aren't going to continue to take your mismanaging of the characters we love. MoS was a strong start from WB then they jumped the gun with BvS. Again that's the studio's fault. DC does not have a separate studio or creative control on the movies. They have to consult with the executives. You can't make a movie like Justice League without a solid script. I think it may have been there in the beginning but so much of the film is cut and you can tell. <br/><br/>The CGI was incomplete. Say what you want about Zack Snyder his CGI is the great. However two directors with the studio telling you to do this do that. Please establish your main characters, and the secondary character can come later. Overall it was just okay."

","Getting into this movie after Man of Steel, Batman V. Superman and Suicide Squad I was not expecting much, and I've rarely liked any of Zack Snyder's work. I had slight hope after Wonder Woman, but it was worse than I had expected. <br/><br/>The first part of the movie introduces us to a bunch of characters, but the half-assed way the movie tries to gets the viewer to care about new additions to the DC movie universe, The Flash and Aquaman and Cyborg, by introducing some parent issues which have nothing to do with the plot at all for the first 40 minutes or so of the movie was absolutely awful and boring. It didn't help that I knew about these backstories from previous DC knowledge, but friends of mine who have barely any comics/ CW tv show history didn't care either. It's like the filmmakers thought it was just another thing to cross of their list of things that are supposed to be in a movie like this but didn't actually care about. It certainly did not work.<br/><br/>We also get introduced to the villain, Steppenwolf. What a waste. Every single line was laughingly bad, B-movie quality. Nothing original or intestering whatsoever. This is a problem other comic movies have at times, but this might be the worst villain I've seen in a long time. <br/><br/>Then there's the acting. Ben Affleck just simply gave up after the last movie, didn't he? It really seemed like he hated being in this movie. No emotion, no confidence, just apathy. Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa did their best and were fine, but everyone else... although it's tough to be too hard on Ezra Miller when you look what he was given, absolutely awful jokes and no-one to even react to them. No chemistry at all with any of the other main actors, which is pretty important for an ensemble piece like this! I'm not even getting into Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons and J.K. Simmons who were simply wasted and didn't care at all, just getting a paycheck.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder's direction with his usual habits like way too much slow motion for no discernible reason what so ever are present which certainly did not help. Likewise that so much of this movie was obviously shot in front of green screens and Henry Cavill's CGI face and his CGI removed moustache, wow, just atrocious.<br/><br/>Also the OST was really bland and boring compared to the rest of the DCEU movies, which at least had notable scores from Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL. <br/><br/>In summary, it hardly seemed like anyone involved with this cared about this movie. Hopefully Warner Bros either decide to get some people in who do care, for their sakes and the viewers'."
"Notorius2","8","0","0","17 December 2017"," Just a few flaws
","(Spoilers after this first pararaph.) As it is my job to watch this movie 5 times I was able to notice all its flaws but for me it remains a good super hero movie, very entertaining and even with one or two emotional moments.
I agree with others that Ezra's adaptation of the flash was cheezy and childish, but in his defence he is the youngest of the bunch. Overall all the comic relief scenes are misplaced and not funny at all ruining even the mood at the final victory. 
But I dont agree with the people that say there was no character depth. Batman is moody, Aquaman has trust issues all the way to the final battle, Cyborg is depresed and holding him self back and Wonder Woman is heroic. The clues about what drives each character and defines their motivations arealways there. But they are not always neccesary to be obvious.
Another major flaw lies with the movie's villain. Stepenwolf is the real character with no depth. He is uninteresting, unlikeable and highly ridiculously CGIed. He has hands, he has a mouth and he looks like a human so why was it so hard to get a human to play the part. All it needed was some good prosthetics and make up.
And this bring me on the last flaw wich was the CGI battles. They looked like they were drawn directly from a videogame and for a movie this big it is just shamefull.
Casting all the flaws aside this movie was very good. The moment when the flash realises he is f***ed gave me goosebumbs every time and the audience on the cinema felt the same.
Every scene with the charismatic superman is fantastic and we own to him the only really funny scene which ofcourse is after the credits. I highly recomend this movie to fans and to movie goers who are looking for a good super hero movie"

SPOILER ON *Steppenwolf is defeated so easily. Superman alone could have beat him, while Steppenwolf could not even touch him. Furthermore Superman is smiling while easily dodge Steppenwolf incoming attacks.* SPOILER OFF </li><li>Superman..huh...without spoilng i can say, they changed the character, but because he has little screen time, he is not really built up. However Superman is in the third DCEU film, the character is totally left in the shadow. I can't tell any specific about his personality. So how can i score Henry Cavill acting. I can't because i don't know what kind of Superman he is playing.</li></ul>"

","When I saw the trailer, I wasn't impressed...it's not the effects or the cast but there was something about it that lacked spark. Maybe it was a lack of bright, colorful visuals but when I actually got to see the movie, it left me very disappointed. <br/><br/>The visuals infact felt ok and the effects are very good as expected. So were the cast performance. But the movie as a whole was still a let down. Did Zack Snyder really direct this? :( I guess a director is only as good as his writers or even choreographers. Many lines felt predictable, the action(except for Amazon warriors vs Steppenwolf) was average for DCU standards, few scenes were unnecessary(a 'race' between Flash & Superman for example) or cringe worthy and some of the important characters were wasted or weakly portrayed here like Lois Lane(Amy Adams), Martha Kent(Diane Lane), Commissioner Gordon(JK Simmons) or Alfred the butler(Jeremy Irons). These are hugely talented actors who could have been given a better deal in this movie or ensure that whatever little moments they've on cam don't look superficial. The lead actors(Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Henry Cavill, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa & Ray Fisher) got to hog too much of the limelight that it end up wasting others' presence. Except for a short fight between Amazon queen Hippolyta & her army against Steppenwolf that hooked me for a while, everything else about movie was an uninspired watch. They even made Superman look yuck(digitally removed Henry Cavill's moustache and his face end up looking worse). Unless there's a major transformation among the people behind the camera - a change of director, writer or action choreographers etc - the sequel is gonna be a disappointment too.<br/><br/>Verdict: Gal Gadot is still adorable, the others are ignorable and to sum up, this one is avoidable."

"amberlitteken","4","0","0","16 December 2017"," Too much going on
","The main things that fell short for me in Justice League was the weak uninteresting villain, the unrelatable super heroes, not to mention the wasted time on new character introductions. <br/><br/>The villain was so uninteresting in this movie I had to look up his name: Steppenwolf. So insert uninteresting overdone villain plot here. He wants earth to be his and unleashes these hellish bugs in swarms all over to help him take it. And he couldn't just do this himself he needed the help of these weird ancient magic boxes. Yeah I dunno. I can't even recall him being in a decent fight scene. Actually, Steppenwolf isn't in a lot of the movie. He is never really shown preparing for battles, raging over failures, or celebrating his successes.<br/><br/>Justice League had unrelatable superheros. Take Superman for instance. He is literally better than any of the other superheros at everything. What is the point in having a super-fast superhero like Flash, if Superman can run (oh, or fly...can Flash do that!) just as fast as him? Wonder Woman couldn't take Superman in a one on one fight. And Batman? At this point he is more like a concerned citizen with lots of money. So Flash, Wonder Woman, and Batman are irrelevant when standing next to Superman. We also rarely see these heroes make a mistake. They always overcome what should be undefeatable opposition, with tactics, pure strength, teamwork or Superman, their ace in the hole.<br/><br/>Since Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg did not have their own character introduction movie, Justice League had to take time out of the movie to introduce these characters, give them some backstory and bring them into the League. Oh and Superman was dead at the end of Batman v Superman...so they had to find a way to bring him back to life. This was all a huge mistake. These many disparate plots detracted from the movies main conflict and resolution plot and had the audience watching weak character development. The audience had to switch context multiple times between bringing in Flash...waiting on Aquaman to stop being a loner, deal with Cyborg learning about his newly acquired powers, reviving Superman, and oh right. the dude trying to destroy the world.<br/><br/>Oh...and if you thought Superman's face looked weird in this movie, you are right. Henry Cavill had a mustache during part of the filming, which they had to edit out in post production."

","Not a DC follower, so I don't know anything about flaws in the story or whatever, just commenting on what I saw in the movie.<br/><br/>So my take on this movie is this:<br/><br/>Lot's of CGI action (as usual), but it's not as refined as, say, Deadpool (which has appalling CGI voice over, but still). For voice over CGI: Superman is usually flying (some meters from the camera) but his voice is clear and not shouted and I can hear it as if he was standing next to me on a chit-chat. <br/><br/>The Batman is ill-prepared for a situation, and his preparedness is what gives him anykind of upper-hand, or any hand at all. He just roams there, getting is face punched in.
Aquaman is a furious Dothraki, misplaced and useless in most situations.
Wonder Woman is gorgeous, but just that. 
Cyborg is cool actually. 
The Flash is quite obnoxious/fun/rip off of Quicksilver in the way they made it.
In the end, this league isn't just, it's only a supporting crew of Superman, which deals with the situation, even after just being ressurrected, with ease and some boredom.
The story is quite dull, although there are some moments. Although Ezra Miller is in my opinion the lesser actor from the bunch, he does save the movie, otherwise it would be just terrible.<br/><br/>All in all is not a bad movie, not cringe-worthy, but still I wouldn't recomend it unless you're a fanboy"

Sure the story had its problems and shoddy CGI but DC tried to address all the problems BVS was criticized for. Superman was not brooding anymore and a lighter tone. For the most part it worked. All the heroes were great even though some character building moments were clearly missing for Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman.

It's about the same quality as most recent Marvel movies, along with the same generic copy/paste bad guys.<br/><br/>The whole deal with Superman's moustache removal really isn't too noticeable outside of a couple scenes. I feel if we didn't know it had happened, we might not have noticed anything was up.<br/><br/>The plot isn't very interesting at all but I suppose it does work exactly as intended for our heroes to join up. The character introductions are nice, and I do really like the actors that have been chosen for each role,with Erza Miller being the highlight. He is mostly around for comic relief but I am really looking forward to seeing him in a standalone movie.. whenever that comes to fruition.<br/><br/>There isn't really anything worth seeing again outside of a particular scene involving Superman, and overall I don't hate it, but I don't love it.

It is now up to the Justice League to try & stop him. The first hour is spent introducing all the characters. Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Flash (Ezra Miller), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) make an appearance for the first time. Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) does a Tony Stark & tries to assemble a team of superheroes to fight Steppenwolf. This does sound & look formulaic, the writers could have come up with something new. Some superheroes readily accept, while some take their time. But predictably, all of them combine forces when it really matters. The movie does consist of a pleasant surprise in the second half, which will delight DC fanboys.
The acting by the cast is decent. Ben Affleck & Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) are good. Ezra Miller as Flash provides comic respite. His friendly rivalry with another superhero in the second half will make you smile. Jason Momoa & Ray Fisher are decent. Would like to watch their standalone films in the future. We did not get bored during the movie & neither will you. Director Zack Snyder must be credited for keeping us entertained.
While there were no glaring flaws, there was nothing special either. The movie follows a very similar trajectory as compared to Avenger series. It is very formulaic & cliched. We are die hard fans of Batman thanks to Christropher Nolan - Christian Bale's Batman trilogy. Unfortunately, the Zack Synder - Ben Affleck combo is no match to their predecessors. You will not be in awe of the film.
If you enjoy superhero movies, you will like this one. But do not expect something out of this world."

","Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman, Batman vs Superman and now Justice League all have something in common. Giant boring bad guys with no real clear motivation other then ""I will destroy this world because it's my right blah..blah..blah"".
Okay, maybe less in BvS but Lex's motivation was just KILL SUPERMAN. 
Anyway, Steppenwolf (Not the rock band) who was basically never mentioned in previous movies appears as the bad guy who claims to have the right to destroy the world.
Whatever, motherboxes are brought into the picture with only being minimally mentioned in Wonder Woman. 
Or was it BvS?
Does it matter? It's just not clear at all why he's there. What the motherboxes are for...nothing. He's just another DC bad guy wearing a giant suit of armor using giant beams of light from the sky to rain down destruction. C'mon guys, can we stop with this now?
The first act and half is Bruce putting the band together and then once he does have them he says they're not enough. They need Superman. So, they decide to user a motherbox to resurrect him.
Wait, didn't we see dirt on his casket float up at the end of BvS?
Yes we did.
Is it ignored completely?
Yes it is. 
So he's resurrected.
The following few minutes are probably some of the best parts of the movie as an angry confused Superman proceeds to beat the living crap out of all the other heroes. Including a face-smack to Batman that sends him flying across a field into a cop car. Only when Lois suddenly appears (and completely outs him by calling him Clark in front of cops) does he calm down.
Clark goes home, Justice League goes...to the batcave I THINK to devise their plan. 
Something bad is happening some where on the other side of the world. Batman ""my Bat jet thing won't get there in time""
Cyborg ""it will for me""
Okay so, he can make engines designed to go a certain speed go faster.
Cool.
Kinda convenient too.
They fly to other side of world. BAM BAM BAM..fight Steppenwolf. Superman appears and we suddenly realize it literally could have all been done with just Superman and Cyborg. Nobody else was needed.
Seriously.
Nobody.<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie a six only because it had some funny one-liners and some of the interactions between the characters are genuinely good. Also, Danny Elfman managed to sneak in a few bars of his 1989 Batman theme in key scenes.
AWESOME!<br/><br/>Lets hope if there is a Justice League 2, they go a COMPLETELY different route. Time for Snyder to stop making these movies.
Well, all movies. Really.
Bring in somebody who has respect for these characters."

","The movie's a mess but there's something about this that made me like it more than Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman. Suicide Squad was a generic blockbuster finished with atrocious editing and BvS was an insult to everything I loved about movies and DC Comics in general.<br/><br/>Justice League doesn't have this problem. It fails in a ton other areas but I couldn't help but like it. I even liked this more than Thor Ragnarok, which is weird because Thor 3 is a much better movie than Justice League. <br/><br/>I guess it came down to not feeling disappointed. I wasn't expecting much. I just didn't want to feel miserable and I wanted ""justice' for Superman. I had a fun time watching this movie and my favorite moments were the scenes involving Superman. They pretty much delivered for me.<br/><br/>I can understand the flaws too. Steppenwolf was boring, the film was ugly to look at, and the last minute editing was very noticeable (although, I didn't notice the upperlip which is still an issue (why didn't they make Henry Cavil put on a fave beard for Mission Impossible? Did he really need the authenticity? )). As much as I hate his directing skills, I still feel bad that Zack Snyder's cut was butchered by Warner Bros. I really did like the scenes Joss made but the movie would have been better if it was longer than two hours. <br/><br/>Oh well. Better luck next time."

Not to mention a definite line in the sand between directors(oh yeah pardon me, this film has two, but not if you read the credits)thanks to a hard to wash off in post production moustache.
Now with that being said if this movie did not manage to entertain you, that beating you can feel on your chest is the paramedics trying to revive you, forget it, do them a favour and go to the light.
Its a movie guys, sure it has its draw backs, sure there are moments that make you wonder what 300 million dollars could have been better spent on, Christ its not going to be the last time you'll wonder that, let it go and enjoy the ride that only a movie such as this can deliver.

","Justice League and Alien:Convenant were both huge blockbusters that were super underrated! They were both not a masterpiece at some point but they were both popcorn movies really enjoyable and thrilling with some great leading ! Yet they both had problems wheiter on the directions. <br/><br/>This review is on Justice League so sorry for the Alien:Convenant Cameo.
Justice League was a movie us fans of comics and supeheros have all been waiting so long for Justice League to finnaly have it chances on the big screen.
It wasn't has good has we expected it to be. But what can we really expect from a movie that switched director midle production? My point is has a fan it was an honour and a dream to see the League and I enjoyed the movie I came out with a smile on my face and was happy that I had lived such a fun experience an experience I had waited so much for.<br/><br/>Acting: 8/10: The actors all had chemistry together. We can all see they had fun making the movie! And it turned out to be good, Jason Momoa is the best Aquaman we could of hoped for, Gal Gadot is a stunning and a perfect Wonder Woman, Ray Fisher brings a great character in Cyborg and he really looks honored to play Cyborg, Ezra Miller is a funny and touching Flash, Henry Cavill is has good has expected, Ciara Hinds has a magnificent voice, Ben Affleck so there is my -2 out of 10..... DC fans which I am may bash me oh that -2 but I am saying it out loud I don't like Ben at all.... yall can say whatever you want I still don't like him.... I miss Bale and Keaton. <br/><br/>Directions: 7/10: It felt so rushed (and it was) the runtime doesn't help at all. I mean we all know what happen to Snyder it is a tragedy and kinda is the main problem in the direction. Whedon taking over may not have been the best .... because his vision and Snyder's are completly different on many levels. But he did what he can so I still thank him for that .... yet he still made terrible choices and this movie was a Snyder movie and he changed the vision of it. But for a movie with two completly different directors the directions turned just fine for me.<br/><br/>Cgi: 5/10: That Superman moustache cgi was cringe-worthy..... the final battle cgi was bad and the cgi on Steppenwolf was pretty bad too...... But the cgi on Flash was pretty damn incredible ! And Cyborg suit was actually a suprise since it was actually amazing! <br/><br/>Music: 9/10: The Music was fun !!! Even though we haven't really have all of it since half was cut still the results were great the music used matched every scenes!<br/><br/>Characters: 10/10: One thing we can all agree on is how DCEU has a touch with their characters such as in Suicide Squad or Justice League both had problems but their characters weren't one of them problems.<br/><br/>Place in the DCEU: 7/10: It was a great follow-up to Batman vs Superman.The story was well placed for sequels.... yet it came out after one of the year finest movie: Wonder Woman........ which was a hard movie to compete with so expections were even higher than before for Justice League. But the biggest problem was that we din't really got to know all of our characters the movie came out to early.... we should of explored the characters a little more before making a movie about all of them joining together...<br/><br/>Enjoyment: 10/10: If you're a DC fan or a person looking for a fun time well Justice League is November answer! It with cheer you up with a great smile. Don't find it's mistake just Watch it and enjoy it ! <br/><br/>That's a 8/10 for me ! Thank for reading my review!

","Justice League is a bit better comic filming, than Batman vs. Superman was, but nothing special between all comic filming dominating by Marvel. DC comics tries to create their own superhero universe, like Marvel has done with their comic super heroes. Basics are ok in Justice League, but poor script and too many characters makes it too fuzzy and thin. With massive 300 million dollar budget viewer expect much more than this. Maybe too many actors with too big salary is reason for this. Some special effects feel quite poor unfortunately.<br/><br/>DC comics should have use their resources to introduce us some less known super heroes like Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg with their own movies before they rush to dump them all in the same movie. Now there are simply too many stories to tell and focus does not have enough of room to breath. Jack Snyder's replacement with Joss Wheadon at the movies finishing, many screen writers and last but not least some re filming has made the movie too unfocused.<br/><br/>Justice League is mediocre comic book superhero filming. We shall see how many flops like this DC comics can afford, before they hang Batman's and Superman's rope conclusively. Maybe DC comics should concentrate their own movies and leave Marvel's movies not to mimic."

","Once again the DC universe manages to pull off another great hit. This movie proves how superior DC is to Marvel. Watching all of Marvels movies you begin to realize that all of them have the same issue, they are just confused about what they want to be and are rushed in order to hit big holidays. But DC does the exact opposite, they plan every scene down to the dust specs in it. And they don't feel the need to rush their movies just for profits they care about what the fans want. Personally Zack Snyder has made these movies excellent and him leaving has only made the movies worse. But beside that the acting in this movie is phenomenal. I have never seen a movie which has put so much effort into making sure the actors are in role before filming. And once they develop the strong connection between the characters and the audience they move into great action scenes. Once you see the action in this you realize how awful every other super hero movie has been. Over all I would recommend this to everyone I meet I hope everyone else does as well in a last ditch attempt to get Zack Snyder back into the DC universe."
"MikeEhms","3","0","0","13 December 2017"," Predictable
","Justice League was predictably shitty. Most of what's wrong with it was apparent since the first trailer, and amplified when Joss Whedon took over. It's a cluttered/rushed mess, the characters are one-dimensional, the dialogue is poorly written/unfunny, etc. One thing I didn't expect was just how cheap this film looked. Not just in terms of the special fx (which I'll elaborate on later), but also through the lighting, cinematography, and other filmmaking aspects. There are many moments (mainly the ones that were obviously directed by Whedon) where everyone is completely washed out as if they were in an office. And in those scenes, the cinematography is as bland and lazy as possible. There's one scene at the Daily Planet where Lois and Ma Kent are in a conference room and not only are the completely over-lit, but their conversation is just filmed as a a shot-reverse-shot for the entirety. Not too mention that the color-correction makes them look extremely vibrant in a very ugly way. The obvious Zack Snyder scenes try to have decent shot composition, but those are few and far between. On the topic of the effects, there is no excuse for this. These are the worst looking special effects in a blockbuster film since Gods of Egypt, and JL has double the budget ($300M). This is one of the most expensive movies of all time, and it's one one of the cheapest looking films I've ever seen. From the shitty green screen to the entirety of Steppenwolf, nothing looked good. On that note, Steppenwolf is easily the laziest, most boring, safest, and least interesting villain in any superhero movie to date. He exists to be a thing that the Justice League defeats and also a set up to Darkseid (DC's big bad), nothing more, nothing less. His plan is his design is uninspired, his voice is clichéd, his dialogue consists of only villain one-liners, and his final battle is as quick and painless as possible. There isn't much to say about the other characters considering that they really have no depth/development outside of what was previously established in other films (characters like Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg are left in the dust however). The only character I legitimately enjoyed was Superman and that's only cuz I'm easy to please. Also I was burned so bad by his portrayal in BvS that this Superman only had to smile and I was satisfied. Also he is absolutely broken. Whenever he's in a battle he just kicks the shit out of his opponents like they're nothing. He basically single-handedly beat Steppenwolf, and almost killed the entire Justice League. Just goes to show who's really the best character. And yes, the cgi mouth was disgustingly noticeable. It looked like a rubber, moldable version of when someone has an upper-teeth retainer and tries to keep their mouth closed. It's a safe, messy, ugly, rushed, and absolutely boring movie. But fans loved it. So I guess I'm the asshole because I can't enjoy a fun movie. I just hate fun."

","Justice League was okay,nit was a step up from Batman V Superman.The movie's cinematography was good as each shot was fit into the movie. Not just thrown in there randomly. With the action sequences and shots done by Fabian Wagner, who previously did cinematography for Game of Thrones from 2014 to 2016, also he did cinematography for Starz's DaVinci's Demons, and recently 2015's Victor Frankenstein which starred Daniel Radcliffe as Igor and James McAvory as Victor Frankenstein. Zack Snyder directed this movie and wrote the story with Chris Terrio. Zack Snyder previously directed 2004's Dawn of the Dead, 2006's 300, 2009's Watchmen, and 2013's Man of Steel and 2016's Batman V Superman Dawn Of Justice. His movies may not be great but are entertaining and fun to watch. He was producer for Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman. He wrote the story for Wonder Woman and that was a good movie because of Patty Jenkins directing. And a clever script. Joss Whedon wrote the screenplay along with Chris Terrio and with them working together on the script it was okay as it didn't fully add up the story felt rushed a bit as it wasn't properly planned out like what Marvel did, but still a movie like this there's gonna be things that don't add up.Ben Affleck was executive producer for the film and also was Batman,Christopher Nolan was also a producer he directed/ wrote/ and produced two of the three The Dark knight films and this year's blockbuster Dunkirk, his movie's take time and effort and so did Justice League as the money was well spent despite the movie not being critically acclaimed and sagging a bit in its storyline as the character's weren't developed as two of the Justice League character's movie's haven't came out yet, but with Jason Momoa's Aquaman and Ezra Miller's Flash these two character's felt like they were good for their characters. Henry Cavill came later in the movie but when he came on the screen the movie was reaching the climax. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman was great how she introduced her character in Wonder Woman with such emotion and enthusiasm. Overall the movie was fine but is one of the better movie's directed by Zack Snyder despite it's plot holes and not to much character development"
"prathikofficial","8","0","0","12 December 2017"," Exceptional in many ways but not without its own flaws.
","As a kid who grew up watching the Justice League animated series, I could barely hold my excitement when this movie was announced. The casting decisions received some unnecessary flak from all quarters but that is what surprised me most. Jason Momoa, Gal Gadot, and Ben Affleck were clearly the best parts of the movie. However, I feel like Ray Fisher could have been a little less robotic with his portrayal (Cyborg is half human after all).<br/><br/>Before going to watch this I had heard a lot of negative comments about Danny Elfman's score and Joss Whedon's attempt at directing this movie. Danny Elfman's score was a major nostalgia truck that borrowed key elements of the historic tunes of each hero (especially Batman and Superman). Joss Whedon helped lighten the entire tone of the movie and move it away from the unnecessarily gray frames that WB goes for. If you feel like it didn't make any difference, compare the first trailer with the final one.<br/><br/>The CGI was puke-worthy at best. Steppenwolf was a big gray thing that only struck fear into the heart of the perennially scared Barry Allen. This brings us to the next issue- If the parademons smelled fear, then why did they not chase down the Flash? <br/><br/>I think I would have preferred a Superman with a beard. Rather than spend millions on removing it with ""cutting-edge"" tech, the studio could have let him keep his facial hair and throw a black suit into the mix for fun.<br/><br/>It is safe to say that Ben Affleck has become the definitive Batman, and it would be really tough seeing anyone else in the cowl right now. The opening scene is straight out of an Arkham game and his humorous quips were never out of character. Jason Momoa is one of those actors who can effectively change how we view a character, whether it is Khal Drogo or Arthur Curry.<br/><br/>All in all, I'm happy with how the movie has turned out and I'm extremely glad we didn't get a repeat of Batman V Superman.<br/><br/>P.S. Stay until the end for a glimpse of Joe Manganiello and the Lex Luthor we deserve."

The reviews were bad so I had low expectations, but it's worst than I thought it will be. I have no more words to describe how hollow this movie is.

","Well a superhero film stand and falls with a super villain. This particular super villain called Steppenwolf is really an awful one. Not only is he badly animated (it felt like he came out of a computer game) but also is he so lame and badly written ( his quotes really are like just out of a bad 90s computer game). I am one of the few who tolerated ""Batman Vs. Superman"" although it was overlong, here they tried to avoid that and trimmed the film awfully down so that you really are not able to make much of a connection to most of the characters. The true emphasize was on CGI action, and although some images were truly great, the animation part was second class. Ben Affleck was as wooden as it gets, while he had some energy during his Batman debut, here he obviously paid his dues and had no motivation whatsoever. Henry Cavill was, okay but also wooden. I liked Gal Gadot who she had not the spirit as in her solo movie. Still she was probably the best of the cast along with Jason Momoa, who really had a cool character that makes me curious for his solo film (although I am not sure if his character works in a whole environment around him and not only s a sidekick). I also did like Ezra Miller who had some self irony, sure he was a bit too smart assay and a true sissy that was on the edge of being annoying but still bearable. The most interesting addition acting wise and character wise is Ray Fisher's Cyborg. But I never felt the bond of that gang, unlike with The Avengers. They tried it but failed. Oh and why were there only like 2 minutes of J.K. Simmons? Damn did they cut that thing. Also it should be illegal to waste Amy Adams like that. Jeremy Irons Alfred was just there for the sake of being there but did not add anything to the whole thing. Inspired images at times, a totally uninspired score ( tho I did recognize some of Danny Elfman'S original Batman tunes, which was cool at least). The only positive thing is here we really got the Batman Vs. Superman standoff we all were waiting for during Batman Vs. Superman. I don't need another installment of Zack Snyder's group therapy."
"sujanfaster","8","0","0","11 December 2017"," It's never a bad time for some Justice!
","The critics' dark cloud has doomed over a DC movie yet again. Although this might not have affected the box office collections of the Justice league much, it made sure that this movie didn't break any records. I am writing this review after having read most of the reviews and quite few many days into the release date. Just like Batman V Superman, I liked Justice League and in fact I loved it.<br/><br/>After the stupendous success of Wonder Woman in July, there was quite a decent platform set for the release of the Justice League. The Batman v Superman movie set the foundation for the collaboration of heroes and Justice League brings the concept of heroes teaming up (or should we say forming a league), to save the world. Batman leads and brings new recruits into the team in his own style with the help of Wonderwoman. And by now most of you would have already known how Superman gets involved. This movie is has a very tight running time and it wastes no time in setting its agenda straight. The villain is introduced at the beginning followed by the new heroes and then they all involve in an epic battle. The visual effects have a slightly different tone from a regular superhero film, but I am not complaining. The scenes involving flash are a treat to watch. The film has many moments of good humour and sarcasm compared to previous Snyder's movies (did it have something to do with the fact that Joss Whedon partly directed the movie?). The short duration of the movie left me wanting for more.<br/><br/>The movie does lack a strong or rather well defined role of the antagonist. Comic book fans can probably give a better review of the SteppenWolf character voiced by Ciaran Hinds. Portraying an aging and least dominating Batman suits Ben Affleck like fish to water. Although Jason Momoa doesn't have much to speak as Aquaman, he surely ups the humour level of the film which is already set at a higher bar by Barry Allen aka Flash played by Ezra Miller. Ray Fisher has a decent debut as Cyborg, but the role doesn't test much of his acting skills. Gal Gadot is classy as always with her portrayal of Wonderwoman. Other top billed actors like Amy Adams, Diane Lane, J.K Simmons and Amber Heard doesn't have much to do. However, they would probably be playing vital roles in upcoming individual Batman and Aquaman movies.<br/><br/>At some point one might feel like DC may have tried to play catch up with MARVEL in a hurry as far as building a cinematic universe is concerned. I would have loved to see separate movies for all of these characters before the Justice League which would have given this a very good build up. This doesn't affect the fact that Justice League is still one of the best action movies of 2017 and is a very good watch."

","I'm not a DC fanboy or a Marvel hater; i'm also sad that i have to start a review with that disclaimer. I thoroughly enjoyed the Justice League movie. I've always been a fan of the WB animated series, and this film feels like an adaptation of my favorite episodes. It's lighthearted when it needs to be and grim where it needs to be. You get a sense of the iconic nature and raw power of these characters, with winning personalities to boot.<br/><br/>The wave of criticisms tossed at this film are mostly unjustified. Most complaints lodged against this film are either the result of not paying attention or just plain bias against the DCEU. For example, most critics complain that the villains motivations were not clear, when the film clearly established that he was a religious fanatic doing the bidding of an entity in the mother boxes and his nephew Darkseid (He even says ""For Darkseid""). There are many more examples of such unfairness in the multitude of reviews online.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Justice league is an unfortunately misunderstood film,but a very entertaining one"
"xamtaro","7","0","0","8 December 2017"," What should have been like an epic season finale ends up as a mid season filler
","It is no simple task for a movie to introduce 3 new characters, present a narrative of these characters coming together, build camaraderie, flesh out the stakes, the threat, follow up on existing plot threads from past movies and give closure to the development arc of Superman all within a mere 2 hours (including opening and end credits). JUSTICE LEAGUE is brief to the point of absurdity and most of its problems result from the post production process of editing and incorporating reshoots all in a bid to cater to the lowest common denominator.<br/><br/>Following the death of Superman, criminals have become emboldened, plunging the world into a state of terror. In London, Wonder Woman stops an extremist bomb Attack while back on Gotham City, Batman is investigating the appearance of flying alien creatures that seem attracted to intense feelings of fear. A close encounter with one of the creatures convinces Batman that the alien invasion he so feared was imminent and he proceeds to recruit the super powered individuals whom he discovered in the previous movie BATMAN V SUPERMAN. Meanwhile, the alien warlord known as Steppenwolf makes planetfall intent on stealing 3 ancient artifacts known as the Motherboxes in order to unite them and summon forth a power that will destroy the earth.<br/><br/>The first act is a hasty haphazardly edited sequence jumping around the world and from character to character. There is hardly a sense of chronology or flow to the scenes! Perhaps if the movie was edited to focus on one character at a time culminating in the arrival of Steppenwolf at Paradise Island it would have flowed better. Instead it feels like scenes just end prematurely to cut to a wholly unrelated scene only to cut back minutes later. Arguably the flow improves once the team gets together for their first mission to investigate mysterious abductions in Gotham.<br/><br/>Problems of its truncated narrative aside, JUSTICE LEAGUE does a good job of establishing its characters and building the camaraderie. The chemistry between teammates is impeccable. Their unique personalities play off each other beautifully and there are tender emotional moments interspersed throughout the script. My only beef with the script is all the random moments of humour. It just does not mix well. This is an end of the world scenario and you have awkward slapstick, flat jokes and even traditionally serious characters like Batman trying to be funny. With its laughable dialogue peppering even serious battle scenes, the stakes are trivialised and it becomes difficult to take their story seriously. <br/><br/>The hodgepodge Of 2 very differing styles courtesy 2 very different directors is evident from the get go with character even changing appearances between scenes clearly giving away evidence the insertion of reshoots. Even the overall look of the move was given an overhaul. Gone is the evocative colour filters of past movies replaced with a garish palette. Also in removing the filters, the CGI elements stand out more due to the lighting mismatch with the non-CGI elements. <br/><br/>This is a huge pity as much of the action depends on visual effects. Even the villain Steppenwolf is a full CGI character. Thankfully he is a compelling threat. His limited screen time gives him an air of mystery like one of those traditional slasher movie villains and his twisted personality really comes through. The action is also masterfully shot for the most part utilising dynamic camera angles and slow motion to give the perfect resemblance to comic book panels brought to life. Only the final battle comes across as disappointing and generic (and very obviously a reshoot).<br/><br/>It pains me to have to counter every positive with a negative but there is something I have always enjoyed and it is when movies go beyond being mere stimulators of adrenaline and endorphins, and instead address and explore deeper themes in the narrative. Movies that get you thinking. Justice League was none of this and it is sad because there was a lot of potential to explore. We are hinted at the more metaphorical aspect of a movie as a tale of reviving hope in the most hopeless of situations. We are hinted at moral conflicts and the ethics of Batman's sudden proposal to revive Superman with an alien device. We are hinted at a much deeper narrative surrounding the individuals and their emotional baggage. Hinted hinted hinted but never explored or even addressed outright. Themes that were explored in past movies, the deconstruction/reconstruction of a savior archetype, the impact of super powered beings on international politics, the world's reaction to such beings, and much more all abandoned.<br/><br/>The result is a truncated summary of an epic that could have been. Sacrificing thematic depth for levity robs the movie of any uniqueness it may have had in this day and age saturated with superficial superhero shows. It's inconsistency is it's greatest weak spot and seems to indicate that the studio had little interest in telling a compelling tale. The amazing action, the bombastic battles which showcase the extent of each characters' skills, and the near perfect portrayal of each character show that this movie was meant merely as a primer: a means to instill an audience with a greater interest in its characters so as to get them on board for the many inevitable spinoffs. It may make you see superheroes as cool again in a most perfunctory way, but little else beyond that."

","I'm not really all that sure about this film, though a part of me feels that the creators are simply trying to cash in on the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is why it sees that they have decided to bring a number of DC superheroes together. Obviously, when you have to group the superheroes together then no doubt you are going to be looking at something that is going to be super dangerous, which is no doubt the case with this particular movie.<br/><br/>So, we have already met Batman and Wonder Woman, and in the previous films, there have been hints of the existence of some others, namely Aquaman, the Flash, and Cyborg. As for Superman, well, if you remember the previous films then you will know that he is dead. As such there is a suspicion that maybe, just maybe, with Superman out of the way, then some really nasty alien being may consider invading Earth.<br/><br/>Well, not quite, because the entity that comes along is an entity known as Steppenwolf. Apparently he came to Earth a millennia ago and brought some artifacts whose only use is to basically lay waste to the world. However, he is beaten back by an alliance of humans, Atlantians, Amazons, and a myriad of other creatures (including the Green Lantern), and the motherstones were split apart and hidden across the world. Well, it turns out that he has returned, and he wants to find motherstones in an attempt to once again attempt to remake the world in his own image.<br/><br/>As a film I have to admit that it was quite enjoyable, though in a way they just don't seem to stand up to the story that happens to be the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Okay, we have only just started this series and we are only five films in, whereas we are much further into the Marvel series. Still, the problem with having such cinematic universes is that we tend to need a pretty longterm commitment from the actors who are playing the various roles. I'm quite sure that Affleck was over the moon when he scored Batman, but then again Batman just happens to be one of those characters that everybody likes. Interestingly though, there are subtle hints that maybe the original films may be connected with this one, though it has more to do with mention of the mechanical penguins than anything else (and suggestions that Robin has also died).<br/><br/>One of the themes that seems to regularly flow through this movie is the idea of hope. In fact what was interesting was that on the leadup to the film all of these posters appeared around Melbourne (and Sydney) with a picture of Superman, and the words 'Hope Never Dies' printed underneath. I pretty quickly worked out that it was advertising the upcoming Justice League movie, which was actually a rather different way of advertising it. The other thing was that all of our heroes were confronted with the fact that while they could also be shinning lights of hope, none of them were because they were all grappling with their own losses and demons. In the end it is the struggle with Steppenwolf that brings out that realisation.<br/><br/>There are some rather amusing aspects in this film as well, but in the end, unlike the more recent Marvel offerings, there was a much more serious overtone. However, I did quite like the Flash."
"breheneyjames","5","0","0","9 December 2017"," A huge mess but with still some fun to be had.
","At this point, 'Justice League' has already been torn to shreds by most critics and rightly so. It is a mess of epic proportions and features some outright bizarre creative and technical choices. However I still felt compelled to give my two cents on it in a sort of post-mortem if you will. In a way we should have all knew this movie was doomed when WB announced that they were switching directors three quarters of the way through production. Although this is not always an automatic nail in the coffin of a film, it rarely ever turns out for the good especially on a tent pole project. Also given the previous incompetency of the people running the DC Extended Universe division at WB, it comes as no surprise that they couldn't make the director switch a smooth transition. But then again they may have been dealing with an original version of the movie by Zack Snyder which was already mediocre and so they tried (and failed) to patch it up. So when they brought Joss Whedon on board, a director with a style completely different to Snyder's, it's a possibility they were trying to prevent a ship from sinking. However this is all speculation and the way they got to the finished product is rather irrelevant to a review of said product. So now to the reasons why the movie is mostly disappointing but with some enjoyment to be had with these iconic characters. <br/><br/>The structure and plot of the film is predictably generic and par for the course as far as team up superhero movies go. A superhero team comes together, superhero team fights big bad, superhero team eventually defeats big bad and saves the world. In this case the team consists of Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck) and Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) who are, in continuation of 'Batman V Superman', looking to assemble a team of people with special abilities to combat a huge alien threat that had been alluded to by Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg). The newcomers are Barry Allen/The Flash who has super speed, Victor Stone/Cyborg who is well... a cyborg and Arthur Curry/Aquaman who is a half man half Atlantean. And in this case the big bad is Steppenwolf (not the rock band) who is unfortunately just a walking CGI punching bag. But he does have a cool voice thanks to Ciaran Hinds who does his best to deliver some menacing monologues as the character. The baffling thing here is why they didn't just do motion capture instead of a full CGI character that looks like something out of a PSP Lord of the Rings game. But I digress, so essentially Steppenwolf comes to Earth to retrieve three items called mother boxes for reasons that are poorly explained. The movie flashes back to the first time Steppenwolf invaded and shows the forces of Themyscira and Atlantis fighting him off to prevent him from getting one of these mother boxes. He needs them in order to and I'm paraphrasing 'unify the realms of evil' or something or other but the reason ends up being pointless and completely inconsequential anyway. So we have a movie of the team assembling and trying to figure out how to defeat Steppenwolf and then eventually doing so with the help of a resurrected Clark Kent/Superman (Henry Cavill) . This is not a spoiler as is it virtually common knowledge at this point. <br/><br/>As far as the performances go everyone is fine and give serviceable turns particularly Aflleck and Gadot as the leads. Momoa is also very cool as a surfer dude type. Ray Fisher in his first big screen role impresses as a man who lost his limbs in an accident and had to be put back together by his father using bionics. Ezra Miller as talented as he is eventually becomes annoying and almost cringe worthy in his role as Barry Allen. However this isn't entirely his fault. In fact the writing of his character is the main culprit as most of his screen time is comprised of forced jokes and childish humor. There are some pluses to his portrayal in how he represents innocence and vulnerability as kind of the 'kid' of the group dynamic. Th main fun to be had with this flick is the interactions between the characters who all get their moments in either funny moments or downright awesome moments. However that leads me into another way the movie falters and that's focusing on moments rather scenes. Scenes are not allowed to breathe and develop, it just feels like you are constantly being told 'ok this happened' and it then cuts immediately to the next scene or moment more appropriately. This is the same problem that 'Batman V Superman' had and it really needs to stop if the film makers of this cinematic universe want to replicate the success they had with Wonder Woman. It is very apparent that this is what happened here when you realize the original cut was 165 minutes long and they managed to shave it down to 120 minutes. Clearly a lot of footage is missing from the finished product as one can deduce just by watching one of the trailers for this movie. It's also sad that this run time was a mandate set by the head of the studio. Apparently it was a response to audience criticisms that 'Batman V Superman' was too long but ironically in 'fixing' this issue they have arguably made a worse product. <br/><br/>In conclusion, if you can tolerate the scattershot comedy, the often distracting CGI especially Superman's top lip- They had to digitally remove Henry Cavill's mustache due to his role in Mission Impossible 6 which prevented him from shaving it- and the derivative plot and villain then you might some fun with this one if you are already a fan of these characters and the DC Extended Universe. Let's just hope 'Aquaman' is much, much better."

I'm also saddened by the fact ben affleck hardly got a good role as batman . Henry cavil only had cameo in this film. The plot of the film wasn't great as it had no suspense and a very weak villain.

"kgprophet","6","0","0","8 December 2017"," Bland Superhero Ensemble Movie is no Avengers
","There is no denying the only reason this film exists is because of the gargantuan amount of money ""The Avengers"" raked in. The Avengers stunt was carefully setup and well executed, with a charismatic villain. This new type of group superhero movie has now lost it's excitement quotient. I actually found the extended cut of Batman v. Superman to be an entertaining movie. I found Ben Affleck to be a good balance of smart and tough. He is slightly demoted this time around as we have to be committed to this being an ensemble piece. <br/><br/>The introduction of the new characters are the bright spot, as we are introduced to actual new superheroes, instead of a reboot of spiderman, etc. The screen time spent on developing the Cyborg character, for instance, creates some depth and sympathy. Same for the Flash character, who visits his father in prison (obvious plot bait for a future episode). Aquaman is one of those weird superheroes that needs to be setup carefully. It is understandable that Hollywood has never tried to do this type of hero before. The villain, guess what, wants to destroy the world. He is part of the generic side of this story, being able to summon flying robot insect people (or something like that). You might expect that other subplots would arise involving others colluding with the main bad guy. Thankfully, subplots that add extra running time are kept to a minimum. Mainly, because with so many main characters, you have your hands full just keeping them all busy. <br/><br/>Pacing is good with this film, trying it's best to get through a heavy emotional beat in a hurry. For me, I think a popcorn film needs no excuse to stay consistent with the number of minutes between action scenes. Joss Whedon found the right formula with ""The Avengers"", so you can expect his influence on Justice League to be familiar territory. Gone are the flashback/nightmare scenes that were a curveball from BvS. Wonder Woman is already a familiar character, so it is nice not to feel that she has to regurgitate much of her past. Her action scenes perhaps have a bit more imagination to them since she is still a new character with new superpowers. Jeremy Irons is more light-hearted than Michael Caine's portrayal of Alfred. <br/><br/>It is too bad this film felt it had to hold back with the kind of world Zack Snyder had created. It ends up being not very exciting and more of a chore. Certainly the novelty of creating ensemble films are feeling stale. Nevertheless, to get a chance to see more Wonder Woman, and some likable new co-horts, you won't get bored."

","Every 1 and 10 here is a lie, this movie is at best above average and it isn't as bad as the other DC entries so far, including the extremely over-hyped Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>I'll start with the good stuff. The story is simple but interesting. some good jokes, especially on the Superman vs Flash slowmotion and the Pet Sematary joke. Some battle scenes were pretty decent, especially the Amazons one. Cyborg was a good character, but he didn't really use his powers much. Aquaman was a good character but extremely underdeveloped, he barely used his powers in the movie and could've really used a solo movie, unlike Flash and Cyborg which were fine. Wonder Woman and Batman were OK, even though Batman was slightly mischaracterized.<br/><br/>Now the bad. Superman. The CGI on the mustache was just awful, couldn't he have just shaved it ffs? The character was done better this time though. Flash. Really obnoxious, landed two jokes right in the entire movie, being cringe on the rest. Steppenwolf. Weak and underdeveloped character that didn't pose a real threat to the league. The Atlantis scene was also cringe, because Aquaman was underdeveloped. The final battle scene was a tad anti-climatic, Superman was just too strong for Steppenwolf and it ended too quickly.<br/><br/>Overall a very hit or miss movie, but they're getting somewhere.

","So Justice League, DC's big superhero team-up movie. The franchise has had major ups and downs in only four years so where does this one fit in?<br/><br/>I'll start with the overall tone of the movie. After the depressing darkness of Batman V Superman, Wonder Woman and had a lighter tone to it; now I'm not saying it's gone all light & happy and copying Marvel but I mean they literally added colors to the screen and moments that made you smile and feel like justice was prevailing. So with that, I'll move onto the characters. who certainly added to my personal enjoyment of the film. this film took some cues from <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the League themselves. Bruce Wayne/Batman has remained largely the same since BvS but seeing him here just felt different somehow, one of my favorite moments of the entire film is with him on a rooftop near the beginning; it felt really comic-booky and how I perceive Batman as a character so I really enjoyed that. Wonder Woman again is a joy to watch and continues to be a highlight of all of the films she's in; her wise and mother-like attitude is really nice to see in this threatening universe. The new members I really did enjoy too. The Flash, while not always funny, was entertaining quite a bit in both his powers and story-arc. Cyborg I thought was going to be really broody and boring the whole time, and while he is a serious character, his struggle with his situation and the power-set that he has was really engaging and unexpected. Aquaman was a really fun-loving brawler kind of guy and although I enjoyed his presence I hope more of his character is fleshed out in his upcoming solo film.<br/><br/>Story-wise, Justice League is not deep or complex, and not too surprising. I think after the tangled mess of BvS, they took a safe route and a bit of a breather with the simpleness of the plot. I didn't mind that at all and welcomed it but I know many will not enjoy the ""nothingness"" of the story. Part of that has to do with the villain and to be honest, he's not a deeply developed character; another big CGI guy with an army of faceless expendable drones makes for uninteresting stakes. One aspect of the film does involve Superman though, and that's not a spoiler as he's in the trailers and it's no secret. Now I thought his initial return in the film was quite unsatisfactory and it definitely felt like some things had been cut but as the film went on I started to really enjoy seeing him again, especially towards the end. I'd say as far as overall plot goes, it's fairly generic but Zack Snyder's directing does make some interesting visuals along the way.<br/><br/>Another negative I'll point out is the script. Now I know the unfortunate circumstances of why Joss Whedon was brought in to finish the movie and I'm glad he could, but some of the dialogue he injected just did not fit with the characters they were given to. Some of it worked, and I'm convinced Whedon did some good stuff in this but not all of it gelled for me.<br/><br/>In the end, I'd say I personally enjoyed Justice League a lot more than I was expecting but it is ultimately a fluff movie with not much depth and some terrible special effects during the reshoots."

","As it is natural when you have a bunch of supernatural super-heroes, in order to keep making movies one needs to invent more and more outrageous villains. They might work in comics, but as someone who doesn't really care about context and would like to see an entertaining movie, I found the bad guys in this movie as stupid as always. <br/><br/>So batman realizes something is up as lizard aliens appear randomly in the world. Therefore, he decides to round up some people with superpowers, since he's the only one with no superpowers. In the meantime, Steppenwolf comes around and searches for some weird boxes which will connect the destruction of the Earth to his home planet somehow. Who even cares? He has an army and considerable power, but he really needs those boxes, so he goes around for them. As soon as I saw the Amazons on their little island, my expectation of this movie dropped. <br/><br/>Our good guys tried to beat Steppenwolf and his fellows, but failed. Funny how it mostly resumes to punches or sword slashes, or batman's tricks. However, our heroes don't have a scratch, as usual. And Steppenwolf, with all his army doesn't manage to bring down 4 people. <br/><br/>They don't bring him down, so as expected, they resurrect Superman using a box. I found it lame. I expected to see Superman living since he doesn't die easily, so somehow, he must have survived. Resurrecting him with the box was an overstretch. Anyway, he comes back and starts beating our heroes until Lois calms him down. Predictable, exactly how I imagined it.<br/><br/>Then, in the final battle, with some weird purple ball threatening to cover the Earth, our good guys fight the Steppenwolf and his bees, but can't make it without our good Superman. When Superman comes, he makes easy sport out of the bad guy, goes to save some people miles away, then comes back and finishes the job. Who came up with the absurd idea that Superman's breath can freeze stuff? This may work for kids, but hey, we're watching a movie where everyone flies and no one ever gets hurt.<br/><br/>It was a nice try, but it didn't felt good. I cannot begin to wonder what will they do next? Will they fight Supersayans and Freeza across the universe? Who knows, because Superman's back and we need to get more powerful foes to justify another sequel."

","In Justice League, 5 individuals with powers and/or raw intelligence come together (see what I did there?) to stop the catastrophic threat of Steppenwolf. A simple setup that is very clearly the opposite of the extreme convolution that is Batman v Superman, which this film follows upon very clearly. Taking place a couple of months after these events (and a while after Suicide Squad), Superman is dead and the world mourns him. <br/><br/>Evidently, the largest problem in this film is its setup, which comprises roughly half the film. It's a familiar story, assemble a team and tackle the bad guy. Most of the new members, namely Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman, are given some proper character development. Flash is a young man stuck in limbo who is still hung up over his mother's death (the cause of which is evident to anyone who watches the TV series with Grant Gustin) and Cyborg is bitter over the nature of his condition following his ""reconstruction"", clearly at odds with his father. Aquaman is the odd one out in these circumstances, a rather strange situation considering his own film is the closest to release. His personality shows promise, but I can't help but think that his arc could have been stronger had they stuck with the original running time of 2h 30min. There is simply not enough exposition to him to really care about his arc. Cyborg is the opposite, his exposition is reasonable, but his personality is lacking, with most of his humorous attributes going to Barry Allen instead. This is clearly a problem with the script, which fails to take advantage of Ray Fisher's natural charisma in any of his character's interactions. Overall, however, it is a good setup for a reasonably enjoyable to watch team. A team seriously undercut by a frustrating aspect.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Justice League also has the misfortune of dealing with the death of Superman in its second half, which was an unconvincing and underwhelming addition in Batman v Superman. The repercussions of that awful movie are felt here, where the necessity of the need of the Justice League is undercut in the final act of the film. It's no secret that Superman is back, the marketing team literally included him in the main poster the day after the film came out as if it was a big reveal. Given his power though, the need for the Justice League to conquer obstacles without Superman's help is almost completely gone, his involvement overshadowing all prior teamwork and commitment the group of 5 displayed. This leaves the inevitable final battle feeling heavily anti-climatic for the main characters the film had dedicated half of its run-time to establishing. On the bright side, it is a return of form to Superman, whose personality has clearly changed for the better since his last appearance. He is far more cheerful and less brooding than Batman, as it should be. Still, it is more an advertisement for better days with Henry Cavill's incarnation, one which would seem to benefit from his actor's charisma as well.<br/><br/>The villain, Steppenwolf, played by Ciaran Hinds, is also given ample screen time in the film, far more than I was expecting. Unfortunately, and very clearly a consequence of the film's screen time limitation as well as the writing, his exposition, motives and personality are all utterly crap. The film utilises elements of Jack Kirby's Fourth World very poorly, with minimal reference to the New Gods or even Darkseid and Apokolips. Darkseid and Apokolips were a necessity in a film dealing with Parademons and New Gods, even if that appearance was rather small. What we are left with is a henchman without a master, which severely undercuts Steppenwolf's already vague motives. Ciaran Hinds mentioned that his character ""is old and tired, wishing to escape his enslaved position under his nephew Darkseid"". Yet we see very little of these motives at all, nor its impact on his already bland personality, which reduces Steppenwolf to a generic alien invader who could have been so much more if he had been written with those essential elements as a priority for the film. <br/><br/>The film also cost well over $300 million when including marketing, which only makes me more disappointed in the final result. No DCEU film so far, with the exception of Wonder Woman, has ever exceeded ""good enough"", which shows a distinct lack of quality when compared to Marvel. Fact of the matter is, they are in the same ballgame, and comparisons are inevitable. Justice League, with its range of issues, is not an exception and continues the trend for what I hope is the last time."

","Right now, the long awaited 'Justice League' is taking a bit of a hammering at the Box Office. People are already claiming that it signals the (premature) end to comic giant DC's 'shared universe' (which, in case you're not up on the cut-throat world of comics and their filmic interpretations) was Warner Bros' answer to the seemingly unstoppable juggernaut that is Disney's 'Marvel cinematic shared universe.' And, they may be right, but sadly for possibly the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>The tragedy is that DC has – arguably – the most famous and beloved superheroes in its arsenal, i.e. Batman and Superman (whereas Marvel was forced to rely on (due to licensing issues) a rag-tag band of its lesser-known stars such as Iron Man and Thor). Twenty years ago if you had told the cinema-going public that they were about to witness Bruce versus Clark slug it out on the big screen it would probably have been seen as the cinematic event of all time. However, 'Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice' kind of whimpered its way through the public's consciousness, leaving no one that excited (and die-hard DC fans more worried) about the film that was supposed to bring all their most beloved heroes together for their first major outing.<br/><br/>Critics have already slammed 'Justice League' for being a 'directorial mess,' citing a change of directors for the post- production phase and general studio interference. Now, I'm not saying they don't have a point. Original director Zack Snyder wanted a film that was closer to three hours, yet the studio wanted as many showings per day as possible, therefore made the cinematic cut just under two hours. So the finished product does feel decidedly unfinished. <br/><br/>Also, a few weeks before 'Justice League' came out, 'Thor: Ragnarok' sneaked out in cinemas. And, despite it being about one of my afore-mentioned 'lesser' heroes and it was the third instalment in Thor's personal film career, it was amazing. It performed better than even Disney had hoped and forced 'Justice League' onto the back foot in the public's and critics' eyes alike. There are plenty of other minor gripes like the 'forced' humour that secondary director Joss Whedon seemed to feel the need to add, JK Simmons being very underused as Commissioner Gordon, continuity issues, things that aren't properly explained due to the harsh cutting to save runtime, the – slightly cheesy – CGI, especially in the film's villain himself, Steppenwolf and that one terrible line poor Jeremy Irons is forced to utter during the final battle. However, I felt the real problem lay in the fact that 'Justice League' was released too early. Superman was only given one solo film, before sharing the stage with Batman (for a new caped crusader's first outing after Christian Bale refused to reprise the role and link Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy into this new shared universe). Aquaman was decent enough, but he would have benefited from having his own stand-alone film shown BEFORE he was put into JL. The Flash makes his first film appearance, despite DC giving him his own (highly- prised) TV show and then choosing to create a new version for the big screen. And, as for Cyborg, personally I liked him, but no one besides die-hard fans of the kids' cartoon 'Teen Titans' will know who he was. Wonder Woman was about the film's only real character people felt they connected with due to her having a hit film (or should I say the ONLY hit film) prior to this get together. Therefore, whereas much of the audience this film was meant for has already seen this kind of 'superhero shared universe' played out by Marvel characters. All of which had their own solo films to build up their characters and bring a sense of grandeur to the point in time when they finally come together as one unit. Here, it just felt rushed for the sake of 'playing catch-up.'<br/><br/>If you're wondering what my 'Simpsons-related' title refers to, it's about a little-known episode of 'South Park' which made fun of itself and 'The Simpsons' where the jokes come from the fact that the Simpsons has been on TV for so many years that they've done everything and there's nothing that 'South Park' can do that feels original. This was how I felt watching 'Justice League.' Every time something happened a little voice in my head said 'Marvel did it, Marvel did it, Marvel did it' and that was kind of disappointing. Whether it was watching Aquaman fly and fight like Thor or the team chasing Infinity stone-like cubes to stop them falling into Thanos' hands (sorry, Steppenwolf), everything felt like I'd already seen it before – and, sadly, better.<br/><br/>I didn't hate 'Justice League,' in fact I found it an okay movie and definitely not as bad as many of the online community is making out. However, it is definitely a missed opportunity and could have been so much better if handled with just a little more care and forethought."

","So I didn't hate Justice League. And that is a big step up. I had big problems with Batman vs Superman, as well as with Wonder Woman. Batman's anger issues left me rather dumbfounded in the first, and CGI the was laughable in the latter. However JL kept me entertained and I left the cinema actually looking forward to the continuation, because let's face it, they managed to end it with a pretty good hook (and I am talking about the very end, after the closing credits, so make sure you sit though them). Anyway, let's take it from the start.<br/><br/>Introducing the new characters. A little bit messy and un-engaging. The film tries to be funny but falls pretty flat. I compare it to latest Thor or Spidey flick where the audience laughed out loud constantly. JL got a few hah's or hehe's, maybe a giggle or two. But nobody in the theatre burst out laughing. <br/><br/>The Flash has a naive excitement that perhaps is supposed to woo us and remind us of young Tom Holland aka Spiderman, however The Flash is quite a few years older, so he doesn't come across at all as charming, more a bit dumb. Cyborg's past is briefly hinted but he sort of just shows up all moody and it takes a while to warm up to him. Aquaman, the protector of the sea, is a pesky litter bug; thinking it is a cool move to throw a whisky bottle while walking down a pier, tsk tsk! <br/><br/>The Villain. Aaargh! NOOOO! Not a stale CGI bad guy. Steppenwolf is a big fail and ruined a lot for me. Guardians of the Galaxy (pt1) did the same mistake with Thanos, and it is painful to watch. In Guardians however, Ronan saves the film by being a pretty badass antagonist, as well as a person. Justice League lacks that saving grace. The para demons are better CGI than Steppenwolf, and thankfully there is a lot of them!<br/><br/>The Plot The film moves along in a good pace and there's a lot of action. JL keeps us entertained. A few flaws, like why the hell did NOBODY pay attention to the last mother box? C'mon guys that was beyond sloppy. So yeah, we all knew that Steppenwolf would snatch it at some point, but at least fight him for it... <br/><br/>The Twist Not going to give away too much but... definitely the best part of the film! Well-needed addition to the team. Gave a great boost to the plot as well as to the on-screen chemistry between the actors. Suddenly I found that I actually quite liked The Flash. There was a bit of banter between the characters. I laughed a bit more. I enjoyed everything about the film a bit more. Wise move from the screen writers to add this superhero to the mix. <br/><br/>Overall MUCH more likable than previous DC flicks. OK plot. Great action. The CGI had improved and specially liked scenes with The Flash (even though I think Quicksilver did v e r y similar moves in the X-men saga). <br/><br/>Justice League delivers a good time at the movies, but - it is still miles away from the MCU. The dialogue is more stilted, the sense of humour is hit and miss and Ben Affleck's Batman has the wooden charm of a tree trunk. <br/><br/>Once again, stay until the closing credits! 95% of the cinema goers left the theatre as soon as credits started rolling (something that never happened when going to see a Marvel. It seems DC lacks curious fans who are aware of the fact that there is ALWAYS more to come). The hook for Justice League 2 is a must see. And there is also a good laugh mid credits. Enjoy!"

","Justice League is a good action team film, but not necessarily a good story driven film. First i will start with the pros. The film is overall very fun and exciting, especially when the heroes get together. There is also comedy for the first time in a while in the DC films, thanks to Ezra Millers Flash. The jokes and laughs in the film land for the most part, even though its kinda weird to see batman's serious character take part in the comedic scenes. The conversation and teamwork between the Justice League is extremely entertaining and cool as well. The developing bond between the league is something to behold and takes place mostly in the second half of the film, which is the half that shines the most. Just seeing my favorite comic book heroes getting together and fighting side by side is something that is amazing in itself and is satisfying in the end. The action is quite good and i wish that the film had more of it. the character development, while short lived, is still enough to give all the heroes equal spotlight and attention. Now to the Cons.<br/><br/>The main villain was way to over hyped and ended up being your average run of the mill villain. Stepenwolf doesn't do much in the film. His boss fight is decent but was kinda short and didn't have any innovative challenges or twists for the league. The CGI was kinda off in a few scenes as well, and took me out of the film a bit. And the story wasn't that engaging and was forgettable.<br/><br/>even though these cons are mostly major, i still enjoyed it. Overall this film was a fun time and was for the most part worth the wait."

","The only thing worth seeing is Gal Gadot's disarming smile in the horrendous climax. The most unforgivable thing about it was my favorite superhero growing up was murdered by an annoying performance courtesy of Ezra Miller. His counterpart in Marvel comics, Quicksilver is so much better portrayed, Evan Peters' performance was effortlessly agreeable while Ezra Miller tried so hard to be likable.<br/><br/>DC's extended universe is nowhere near the worst entry in Marvel's cinematic universe.<br/><br/>There's no justice in Justice League<br/><br/>6 out of 10 stars is an average rating for many people but it is a very low rating in my book."

","The most disappointing thing is how much better this movie could have been. Why on earth did they decide to rush this release??? Every character in this movie was fascinating to me. So why did they not get their own movie to build a fan base and create interest?! Avengers did this perfectly - iron man, captain America, hulk, etc. So that when Avengers was released, we knew these characters intimately and cares about them enough to invest in the movie. Justice League crammed bios on Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg for the first half of the movie, and then all of a sudden they're best friends for the second half and fight with each other cos 'Batman and Wonder Woman asked them to'. We are left to rue what could have been a greater treatment of the franchise ultimately. Such a shame."
"Donki","6","0","0","27 November 2017"," It was enjoyable, but it suffers from a lot of things.
","Lets get the general spoiler-free ideas out of the way.<br/><br/>The movie suffered the most from sudden change in direction the studio is taking for the whole DC movie verse as it shows in this movie a lot. We all know how they aimed to build the whole thing towards Darkseid, with the whole JL part 1 and 2. And they were done most of the part when they realized (test screening) that it won't work. I mean everybody said it from the get go that they are rushing to bring a similar ensemble movie as Marvel is with Thanos. The only difference being, how Marvel built up to this point over several movies.<br/><br/>Now we have sudden tone change, that shows in the colors,the dialog and generally having more comedy in the movie overall. And I'm most certain Joss Whedon takes credit for that. We are familiar with Snyders take on these movies, and we already seen what Whedon brought to the Avenegers. They are like the two sides of the same coin, and cannot mistake them from one another. Here you could see which scene was added by Joss.<br/><br/>The problem is that such a sudden change with a movie that was being built up to being something else entirely kind of undermines not only this movie, but the ones that came before.<br/><br/>This movie is happening just days, a month at best, after BvS. Batman killing baddies, being dark and overly brooding, hell his hate towards Superman suddenly does a 180. Like it never happened.<br/><br/>Since the stakes are being brought down (just so they can turn it up again at one point) the sudden introduction of Doomsday, and the death of Superman becomes an even more wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>GOING INTO SPOILERY TERRITORY!!! The movie does mostly a great job at ripping the characters out of the comics and bringing them to life on the big screen.<br/><br/>I am saying mostly since 2 characters suffered, and suffered hard they have.<br/><br/>Steppenwolf is wasted baddie for this movie. He doesn't work visually, as he looks like a huge CGI mess, and he doesn't work as a villain in the overarching story, as his presence is made minuscule in minutes. And that's kind of sad, provided he is considered a god, therefore one would assume the stakes are high. No they are not.<br/><br/>I mean after the lackluster revival of Superman he pretty much single handed beats Steppenwolf to a crisp in 2 minutes.<br/><br/>We are 5 movies into the shared DC universe and we already defined Superman as this guy who can be resurrected to beat up gods(Steppenwolf states that he single handed hunted down and killed the old gods, which indirectly means Sups can do the same, and easily for that matter). So what can the future hold in store for the DC movie verse if we have this hero who can shrug off death and beat down gods? The second character to suffer was Flash. When it comes down to DC I'm a Flash guy. I think he embodies selflessness and hope-fullness better them most other founding members of the JL. Its due to his strong sense of justice, sourcing from his mothers death and false incarceration of his father, he pushes trough his obstacles in a way we can relate to him better then Superman or Batman, who both seem larger then life.<br/><br/>Besides his father being imprisoned there was nothing Barry Allen about this Flash. He was more of a poor mans Wally West. So if you hope to see your favorite speedster in the movie, you might come out of the theater with a bitter taste in the end. Especially seeing how the rest of the cast was done justice.<br/><br/>The story was kept simple, so there really is nothing I can add to it. We have all seen this kind of ensemble movie be done several times. In truth I wasn't expect-in much of it to begin with, but I'd like to see Snyders cut of the movie, just for comparison.<br/><br/>They had several opportunities to make this particular story slightly more interesting, but they just wouldn't leave that comfort zone.<br/><br/>At one point it felt like Cyborg was the 3rd Motherbox, which would have made a more interesting movie.<br/><br/>Would have loved to see the Female Furies. They are Darksides elite force, so they would have worked just as well for a build up movie. Would have worked better for an ensemble movie to, by showing each individual member of the JL fighting. And since they aren't as strong as a New God, the stakes would have been kept higher for future movies.<br/><br/>Aquaman was in the movie, so why put the location of the final fight as far away from water as possible. Give him a glass of water, make him spit on and flip of a Parademon. Just include some water based liquid into his scenes. He was mostly in the background, which is shame, as he was quite enjoyable whenever we got the chance to see him interact with the others or in action.<br/><br/>It was the culmination of the small misses here and there that overall brought down my rating, but in no means does that mean it is not an enjoyable movie. It had done steps in the right direction, but I will not speak of them until I'm certain they were intended and not done by mistake."
"poisonivy-25023","6","0","0","26 November 2017"," 10 Pros and Cons for seeing & not seeing Justice League.
","Pro: <br/><br/>1. Most of the acting from the heroes were pretty great. Great chemistry between the cast <br/><br/>2. It's a step up from 2016's 'Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice' in making characters, more likable. Everybody in the same movie, was angry, sad or depressing.<br/><br/>3. They use cover songs better than 2016's 'Suicide Squad', ever did. Sigrid's cover of ""Everybody Knows"" by music artist, Leonard Cohen and Sharon Robinson & the Beatles track, 'Come Together', were great.<br/><br/>4. The two post-credits was really worth it. Seeing Superman go against the Flash in a race was one of many comic book readers dream. Also, Slade Wilson being introduced. Can't hate that.<br/><br/>5. The pacing was a lot better than the previous movies from Zack Snyder. Barely any slow periods. Movie counts in, 120 minutes. BVS was 150 minutes.<br/><br/>6. Some of the jokes were honestly pretty funny. One such example is the Flash, fighting against Superman.<br/><br/>7. Glad, it's not two movies. Hate, when the story is cut in half, in order to make more money, off the premise.<br/><br/>8. The cameos. It was cool, seeing Marc McClure who played Jimmy Olsen in the Richard Donner Superman film series, has a cameo as a police officer. The highlight for me, was J. K. Simmons as James Gordon.<br/><br/>9. The visuals was lot easily to see. Thank goodness, not all the action pieces were shot in pitch black. Cinematography from Fabian Wagner was honestly good.<br/><br/>10. Movie does kinda works for the 3D format. Lots of scenes with stuff flying toward the audience. Worth the upgrade ticket price.<br/><br/>Con <br/><br/>1. The Alien Invasion Plot is really tiresome. Other comic book movies has already capitalize on the same premise. It felt like rethread.<br/><br/>2. The plot is thin. Nothing complex and smart.<br/><br/>3. The tone of the film is really jarring, due to Zack Snyder being replace by Joss Whedon. It's gritty and dark, one second and then light and funny, the other. It didn't mesh well.<br/><br/>4. Exploiting David Bowie & Prince's death, in order for people to care about Superman in the same vein. Very offensive.<br/><br/>5. Most of the action scenes are way too CGI heavy. Every movement looks highly fake or ugly looking. Characters like Steppenwolf and Cyborg didn't look like, they were, there. It was very cartoony.<br/><br/>6. Expensive out of place reshoots. I don't understand, why they couldn't had write in that Superman had a mustache, when he return from the death. It was a total waste of time and money to pay computer animators to erase the mustache. It was really not well done. <br/><br/>7. Once again, we barely got to know, the backstories of some of the heroes like Arthur Curry/Aquaman & Barry Allen/Flash. They should had their own solo films, before this movie came out.<br/><br/>8. The choice of having Cyborg in the Justice League line-up, rather than original characters like Martian Manhunter & Green Lantern. Also, it kinda destroy the idea of one day, having a 'Teen Titan' movie.<br/><br/>9. Steppenwolf was a forgettable villain. They should had use Brainiac, instead. At least, he would stand out more.<br/><br/>10. This movie was not the best, we seen from composer, Danny Elfman. A lot of the score is just recycled tracks, just told in a much, more darker tone."
"DKosty123","6","0","0","26 November 2017"," Film Does Not Aim High Enough To Be Great Entertainment
","With a whole bunch of writers working on this script, you'd expect more plot and actors getting great lines than you receive. Visually, the 2 hour film is stunning. The costumes, effects, and visuals are exciting. The filming locations in Iceland, the UK and USA are well chosen.<br/><br/>The plot actually does continue the Batman Versus Superman story line. There are moments here which can be very pleasing, and could have been more than they are. It is really subtle where they went wrong, as this type of material is an 8 rating the way Marvel does it. So why does D.C . fall short? That is a multi-million dollar question.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck Batman / Bruce Wayne has quite a bit of talking, but no-memorable lines. Henry Cavill Superman / Clark Kent has even less lines and his parents home almost getting repossessed by the bank illustrates perfectly what the script gives him. Amy Adams Lois Lane gets the bulk of the romantic work smooching Clark Kent, but she is given little else by this script. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman/ Diana Prince is given more script than the rest and she is very enjoyable on screen. I am in awe of how some of those really tight clothes hug her figure (no groping please). Ezra Miller's Flash/Barry Allen gets a few moments of good script, but not enough. <br/><br/>This is not the worst 2 hours I've seen, but should have been better considering the resources. If you go, stick around for the credits, because here, like Marvel, there are some interesting teasers as to what DC is working on. I am hopeful that they check out the Marvel series and raise the bar on their scripts."
"peppertownkid","7","0","0","19 November 2017"," Review to compare marvel and dc
","To start this off. Steppenwolf was never supposed to be super powerful. Superman can handle him with ease. The movie was bringing together the team. Darkseid will be a formidable opponent. One of the criticism was that Steppenwolf was a run of the mill villain who wants to take over the world. Let's compare this movie villain to Marvel movie villains. All marvel villains want power. Vulture, Loki(ruling asgard), ultron, Ronan, Apacolypse, Ajax, so on and so forth. All of which barely have a story. Like Loki. The only story they gave him was that he is a jealous blue adopted child. And they literally have used and abused the character as a laughing stock and a completely predictable villain. Actually I don't remember which marvel villain was not predictable and with a great backstory. If we are criticizing one movie for something but praising another movie for the same thing we just criticize how is that a valid reason to not like the other movie. And the movie is telling a story. The movie was rushed and the cgi was not that great. But when Whedon came in the picture he reshot several scenes and so of course when you have a deadline to meet it wouldn't be perfect.<br/><br/>Another argument I saw was that dc needed to be more marvel and a few saying they need to be less marvel. Same people who keep saying dc is too dark complain that they are trying to be too marvel. One of my favorite things about dc movies is that they try to keep these characters as close as they can to who they are. They don't take one character like the guy full of quips Tony stark who doesn't act that way most of the time in the comics and then make every character become Tony stark and now everyone is shouting quips and people laugh about it because that is not that character. Like when did thor become mister comedy. They literally rehash the same character and slap a different name on them.<br/><br/>The movie moves around a lot but that's what happens in comics. It moves around. Things are happening all over the world. This movie has flaws yes. But it does a good job introducing these characters as best as it could in the 2 hour window it was given.<br/><br/>Thing is I love both marvel and dc and can forgive marvel for its issues. But as I said if you criticize one movie you should not be kind to another for its flaws. It's use reusing avengers 1 for avengers2. I'll evenbreak it down. Villain story comes up super evil. Things get hairy. Now the someone in the avengers has an issue with Tony stark they battle (thor vs Ironman) (hulk vs Ironman). This problem Hinders them from stopping said villain. Villain army shows up almost destroys world or town and itsleft to Tony stark to try to sacrifice himself. Oh throw in those funny quips. Also kill quicksilver in the most dumb way possible by making him pick up a car that weighs way more than a child and his mother instead of just picking both of them up and out of there and now he's shot and dies.<br/><br/>The team is always upset with Tony stark and there is always bad blood with him but people want to talk about superman and Batman's issue. <br/><br/>The forced love between Bruce banner and black widow. Continued Arguments between the avengers that's lasted for 3 movies now and still continuing. But people eat it up. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman was a decent movie but I'd give it the same rating as this movie. At what point was anyone afraid of ares? At what point did they give Wonder Woman a large amount of character development? It was still a great movie as marvel and as dc can make.<br/><br/>*spoilers* maybe.... This movie had me laughing a lot throughout the movie and enjoying myself with all the little things like when there was a green lantern and someone who had the powers of Shazam. The movie was entertaining and I was so amped watching Superman grabbing Batman and calling him out on what he said in the last movie. It has me excited for what dc has in store. They are moving to bigger and better things!"
"jtsemple","6","0","0","19 November 2017"," Watch it for Aquaman
","So this was just a wild CGI punch-fest, but honestly, I knew that from the moment I saw the first trailer. <br/><br/>I didn't hate Batfleck as much as I did in Batman vs. Superman, so that's a positive, I guess. Wonder Woman was herself, but because the film was totally lacking in depth and originality, her moments that were intended to be emotional or sincere just felt corny. That's no fault of Gal's--I really think she did the best with what she was given to work with. <br/><br/>Cyborg was...there. The Flash was actually quite enjoyable: adorkable, clumsy and with a handful of humorous one-liners up his sleeve. When his solo movie comes around I will probably see it and enjoy it if they make it like a medley of Batman Begins and Spiderman: Homecoming. <br/><br/>Aquaman was 100% the standout of this film for me. Jason Mamoa was absolutely great, especially in the non-fight scenes, but even in the midst of chaotic CGI monster tackling, he still got a few laughs out of me. I think I will really enjoy his solo film, particularly if they make it like Wonder Woman's origin story. <br/><br/>This was probably the worst superhero film I have seen since Thor: The Dark World. But I've decided to just view it as an extended trailer for the new character's solo films. If you look at it from that perspective, it's alright. But as a movie, it's pretty awful."

","A lot of fans of the DC comics, TV shows have been waiting for this moment, ""Justice League"" is finally here. Is it any good? Unlike the solo Marvel movies, Warner Bros and DC decided to introduce the main characters through one movie. New comers, Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman receives limited introductions, and character interactions are also limited. This is due to the short the limited run time of 2 hours. Demanded by the Warner Bros executives, the movie suffers from being rushed rather than taking time to build conflicts and characters. However, to see our beloved heroes in a live action movie, and to see Henry Cavill's superman return with grace, to see dynamics between Batman and Wonder Woman just like in the animated shows, to see Flash's sarcasm, Cyborg's intellect, and Jason Momoa's Aquaman's pure awesomeness is a sight to behold. This is powered by good performances and great chemistry between the actors. Unlike other DC movies, ""Justice League"" lacked a good score. Danny Elfman's score is fine, but pales in comparison to the previous scores by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL. Overall this movie was a great time at the movies, and I hope we get to see an extended cut of the film with Junkie XL's original score. 6.5/10 (good)"

","First off, my personal review - 5 stars because I enjoyed half of the movie and had to endure the other half. DCEU has a lot of iconic heroes and lots of amazing stories through the years but this one felt like it was just made up to cash in on the current trend and not be left behind. Too much had to happen and packed into 2 hours so that alone is a let down. If only ... - Aquaman had a standalone movie. To give a deeper back story and character buildup and importance on the stone. - Someone from GL corps was included instead of cyborg. - Batman found the other stone. Think about it, stones kept by major forces, defeated one by one but together stood to defeat the villain again. <br/><br/>They wont need supes, and DC could've gone for the return on the superman story line."
"Pairic","7","0","0","19 November 2017"," An OK, enjoyable film which could have been so much better.
","Justice League: Nowhere near as bad as many critics have alleged. But there is a hole in this film into which much of the story has disappeared. Its original running time was 3 hours and was cut to 2 hours. Likely losing screen time for Lois Lane, Steppenwolf, Cyborg, even Superman and the plot in general.<br/><br/>But it is a stirring adventure infused with humour but perhaps The Flash overdoes that a bit. New villain Steppenwolf returns after millennia to once again battle the Amazons, Atlanteans and Mankind. Hes an alien which suggests that the Gods who fought him in the past are also ETs, putting an SF rather than Fantasy tinge to the affair. He comes in search of the Mother-Boxes, Extreme Energy sources<br/><br/>Aquaman resembles a young Billy Connolly rather the clean cut superhero I remember from the comics of my youth but he is effective against Steppenwolf's flying Bugmen, Zombiesque creatures. As is Cyborg who also provides technical support in the hacking of the Mother-Boxes.<br/><br/>An OK, enjoyable film which could have been so much better. 6.5/10"

","JLA kind of review! I was about to wait for tomorrow but I took a couple of hours to let the movie sink in. And now I am writing this. Usually I don't care enough about coming with my opinion when it comes to movies. But the Dceu has had what it feels like to me an harder time when it comes to peoples judgment it seems unfair and very harsh especially by critics and very hard Marvel fans thinking 2 things can't exist and hunts the dislike button everywhere they can find it. That's why I am coming with my voice to this and be ready because it is a positive one ðŸ¤© OBS! I am not a professional reviewer and for this movie I am happy not to be because my job is not to go there to judge the movie I am there to enjoy it. And with Justice Leuage I did and big time! The heart of this movie is the casting, the casting is just spot on! We love these characters because their take on it feels genuine. They screen well together. And seeing the leauge together for a few paning shots made me wish I was at home already to hit that pause button. Everyone in the team is needed and everyone has a moment in the movie. The pacing is great and for those that has been with the dceu from the starts gets rewarded because the dialog remindes us that we are still in this same universe. The music takes a back seat to the splendid action but has the iconic songs coming in just in the right time for you to get that extra feel. You will know what songs I am thinking of. The story is simple, a plot driver with a villain that gives more meat to the mythos of this world but don't steal any screen time and that's what I wanted. One minute less on the villain 1 minute more of Wonder Woman :) So what you get is an awesome JLA film stylish straight to the point and a honestly funny movie. This movie gets an 9/10 A must watch with a re watch for me, and a 100% must buy on Blue Ray I hope for an extended version. When we get the full version as it was intended 2:50h before studio medling then I am sure I will give it a 10/10"

","Welp...I guess this franchise sucks now too...awesome. They created the perfect Bat suit, and Ben definitely looks the part but as with all of his roles, he looks the part and nothing more. During the scene when Superman comes back to help his league, Batman gets excited and goes ""yes!"" or something super un-batman like that and the stupid face he made with the stupid line made the entire theatre laugh out loud. I'm so glad I wasn't the only one who burst out laughing. Why they included Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman in this movie is beyond me, it should have just been the Trinity (BM,SM,and WW) they definitely did not need to be in the movie and contributed nothing as characters or actors. Then in JL2 they should add maybe Flash and Cyborg, but certainly not Aquaman. The modeling that Jason Momoa did throughout the film was embarrassing for everybody. The last 40 minutes of the movie took place in ""I have no idea where and I don't care"" because everything in the landscape was dark red, brown, and black which means they got cheap on us. The darker the scene, the cheaper it is. When Aquaman rode on the side of the Batmobile, it was as good of a mix as Vinegar and Gummybears, truly neck-wrenching. An embarrassing start to an amazing franchise. Just so bad...there's no hope for hollywood because they don't enjoy film, and they don't understand the characters they're making movies about because they're soulless monsters. Did the producers pocket all of the money? because they clearly didn't spend it on the film.

There's a lot of variation (different worlds, hero's,...). There's room for comedy and the action is very well spread throughout the movie.
The bad guy is a bit childish, and also the flash has something goofy, but that gets evened out by the seriousness of the Batman f.e.

The scene on the planet was very well-written. I didn't saw it coming. Unfortunately there were a lot of bullshits I couldn't miss advert. The Superman story was very boring and crazy. Wonder Woman is a goddess so she is more powerful than an alien from Kripton. The hole team gathering task will be unnecessary after Superman shows up at the end.

The movie has everything; fighting scenes, serious conversations and scenes (which Thor didn't have) and just enough humor you'd want in this kind of movie. <br/><br/>Honestly, after reading critics I'm very upset because the movie is great and all the arguments there are putting are Â…wellÂ… stupid and weak! Seriously I started to think there is some kind of conspiracy against DC because you can't give 45 â€“ 46 to this kind of movie.<br/><br/>Long story short. GO WATCH THIS MOVIE because you won't regret it, I now I would watch it again as soon as I can."

","I'd give this movie 9.5 out of 10 but gave it a 10 since there is no .5 increments and some people rated it too low, so let's bring the ratings back up. Lets face it, Henry is the best superman ever, Gal is perfect for WonderWoman, Ben is decent, a good Bruce Wayne, but could do better. The flash kid was okay, but could be funnier like the TV show actor, They pick the perfect actor to play Aquaman. Zack Snyder is made the best superman and wonder woman movies (costume, special effects) ever that we never saw before in the DC universe. This is a must have to my collection. It was super good. I am a movie lover, and yes there is a some scene that I would made it differently, but that goes with many other movies, no one is perfect, but you can't tell me you didn't enjoy this movie, if not, you are just not a fan, so go see Pitch Perfect, lol."

"emilianozapatagutierrez","7","3","8","18 November 2017"," Justice league is a good movie, entertaining and exciting.
","The movie starts a little messy, but as the story and characters develop, it manages to keep the attention of the viewer, as the characters of the group achieve a very good chemistry on screen, which gives you enthusiasm to want to see more of this group. The conflicts between them and their individual stories make you feel that you want to know more about them. The low point of the film occurs after the development and union of the team because the climax develops very simply and the villain (steppenwolf) is totally forgotten, being a character with a vague development and too simplistic motivations. Understanding that it is only the preamble of what should be followed in the DCEU with Darkseid is acceptable anyway but it could have been used much better. Finishing the post- credit scenes are very interesting and entertaining opening the door to a great opportunity forward in the DCEU, Justice League is a relief for this universe, after a shaky and weak start."
"Travixius","9","3","8","18 November 2017"," A DC Animated movie...done in live action
","Honestly, since Batman Mask of the Phantasm, I have always maintained DC movies should be the cartoons, just done in live action... well that's what this is, with all the corn thrown in, and it works for the most part. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from the perspective of a DC fan as well as a movie fan. The only issue is that one can't help but feel that the movie has been pruned, heavily. This movie feels like a fan edit that has been mercilessly shredded to fit under 2 hours because well, that's what has happened. If any film ever needed an extended edition, this does. Cutting to the chase, don't let the criticism put you off having a good time with Justice League. It respects DC lore and is fun for the casual viewer, so give it a shot."
"deveshmaisuria","8","3","8","18 November 2017"," Fun and good, But it could have been better
","So Justice League has finally arrived in theaters and I have seen it up on the big screen and I have to say first of all is this isn't a Zack Snyder movie, it didn't felt like it at some points throughout the movie, more like Joss Whedon with the reshoots. The reshoots kind of let people down in this movie thinking that Zack would've done much better than Whedon did to finish it off. I liked the first 2 trailers shown and I also did enjoy the 4 minute trailer, but the thing is most of the scenes that you see in the trailer aren't even in the movie almost like 50% of the shots and the scenes from the trailer don't make it in the movie. And most of the people are yet waiting for the extended cut which I think will be around 2 hours and 20 minutes thought so. But you'll realize after you watched the film, that most of the shots and scenes aren't in the movie. From what I think this isn't Joss Whedon's fault but in fact it's WB's because they wanted it to be under 2 hours, if you take out the credits its basically 1 hour and 50 minutes. With credits it is 2 hours and 1 minute.<br/><br/>So let's get straight in the review WARNING this is a spoiler review so if you haven't seen it don't read this review, if you have you may proceed to read this. So starting at the beginning of the scene I was a little bit confused whether or not they've should've added Superman or not. I wanted him to have the first appearance after. So you then get to see Batman doing this brutal crime fighting and witnesses a parademon and thinks that they are coming. And then you get this song about world without Superman which didn't even needed to be in the movie. So you get to see the WW fight and then switch to Ben Affleck's Bruce recruiting Aquaman and this is were it starts to get a little off. So this whole sequence is like for 5 minutes it could've been better if it was like 10 minutes. Without that out of the way you get Steppenwolf's introduction which I think could've been better if it was the opening scene of the movie, and I like how he goes to Themyscira and quickly acquires the first motherbox I think that it was excellent. So let's talk about Superman's return in this movie, his return is very different than most of the people thought that it would be. He returns by this spaceship of his own and he clearly becomes evil and doesn't know what he's become or none of that. We do get this good line which he says to Batman ""Tell me... Do you Bleed"" I think that was awesome. So Lois arrives and he gets his memories back by going to the Kent farm and meeting her mother which she becomes so happy after she see's Clark. Action in this movie is good and it is on a high standard I liked how they first go to this tunnel thing and fight those parademons and also the main villain Steppenwolf. WW has so many scenes. Aquaman to me has a lower amount of screen time. The Flash has one of the average jokes and trust me he also has one of the best jokes too. Batman is brutal and menacing throughout the movie and also happy of Superman's return too as of all the Justice League. Cyborg is the most amazing thing about the movie I liked how he was introduced and became more of a superhero than anyone else. So yeah that's what it is. Steppenwolf I think he could've been a better villain than just a CGI looking villain, though I liked how he mentioned Darkseid which was damn awesome. Superman was also one the best things about the movie it was a total surprise but I wished his return was way better than just reviving him with a motherbox. And also it wasn't good how he didn't had a Black suit which I think Joss probably said no to it.<br/><br/>Overall I would give this a 8/10 it is a better movie I would say it could've had been a better movie if the scenes and shots from the trailers been in the movie. So anyways hope you've all enjoyed my review and that's just my own opinion on the film."
"a_sad_cow","10","3","8","18 November 2017"," Extremely Well Executed
","Long time fan of both Marvel and DC, but will always pick DC if forced. This production was the culmination of many years of development, and the love for every detail showed through in every scene. Although it might be a slight breach of character, you could see the actors and actresses feeding off each other's performances. This is one set I would've killed to be a part of. Thoroughly amazed so much character development could be packed into so few scenes. Mr. Snyder, I'm looking at you.<br/><br/>Batman - I was a skeptic before BvS, but Ben Affleck positively kills it as both Batman and Bruce Wayne. Leadership, direction, contingencies...all the hallmark traits of the Batman franchise in so few scenes.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman - Gal Gadot was absolutely the right pick for this role. I was definitely worried with the direction her own movie's writing was going, but Mr. Snyder gave her the script she deserves. The faceoff with Supes was incredibly well played.<br/><br/>Flash - disappointed in the lack of loyalty the franchise has with Grant Gustin (a fantastic Flash), but Ezra Miller does the role great justice. So few scenes and we're still running to catch up.<br/><br/>Aquaman - Jason Momoa makes Aquaman cool for the first time in franchise history. Incredibly stoked for the movies to follow.<br/><br/>Cyborg - If you're a DC franchise fan, you might still not know who Cyborg is, but he's still a critical member of this team. Ray Fisher delivers the most complex Cyborg we've seen yet (pun intended).<br/><br/>Superman - Henry Cavill kills it. Superman has always been the character to rally around through each version of Justice League, and Mr. Cavill brings that directly to the set, firmly establishing the power dynamic of the team. <br/><br/>Only real disappointment, outside the short screen time, was that the villain was entirely uncomplicated. Raw planet-destroying power is a good closer to a franchise, but sets expectations quite high for the sheer gravity of the sequels, and quite low for the hero- villain banter. On the upside, our teaser gives some reassurance we won't skip straight to Darkseid in the next movie, because where would we go from there? Lex Luthor, Grodd, Black Manta, Deathstroke...there's at least a movie or three there. CADMUS could easily be three more.<br/><br/>To the DC Crew, if it wasn't abundantly clear by this point, you're all rock stars. Keep rocking in the free world."
"bravebear-79002","9","3","8","18 November 2017"," I really do not understand critics
","This movie is awesome. Characters are great, the villain is not as much a pile of cgi like in BvS or WW. There is a lot of super-heroic pathos: themes of hope and being a better person -- I think it's wonderful. This is what made BvS so good -- actual super-heroism. This movie continues themes of BvS, and the death of Superman is certainly the center of the story. The first scene about world without hope, without savior, and the last, about hope and heroism, are spectacular masterpiece. This intense vibe of heroism is really cool. THEY SAID ABOUT THE NEW GODS AND DARKSEID -- that's great. They also showed Green Lantern. And two post-credit scenes are very informative for fans. The one tiny thing to be upset is the feeling of global disaster for the humankind -- there is few of it. That's kind of bad, but not a big flaw. (This movie unlike BvS has no big flaws, like ""Martha"", I guess)."

"venividivinci","3","3","8","17 November 2017"," Holy crap, was this movie terrible
","I love DC. I grew up loving DC. So I had high hopes when Warner Bros. announced a DC Extended Universe much like the MCU. The entire time as people kept picking apart the DCEU, saying it was bad, I defended it. I loved Man of Steel. Hell, I even loved BVS (the Extended Cut, not the theatrical cut). Suicide Squad was terrible, but I was hoping with that movie that it was just a one-off misfire (like how Iron Man 2 sucks), and of course everyone loved Wonder Woman. As much as I loved MOS and BVS though, I felt that with Wonder Woman, perhaps the DCEU finally found it's footing and gained it's edge, and that Justice League was going to be the film to shut up all the naysayers.<br/><br/>Wow, I couldn't have been more wrong.<br/><br/>Needless to say, after this film, I've finally given up. I've given up on the DCEU. I've given up defending it, I've given up trying to make sense of this rushed world they're trying to create. I am simply done.<br/><br/>First, let's talk about what I did like. The acting was phenomenal, seriously, it was. Everybody in this film did a tremendous job playing their characters and trying to do their best with the terrible dialogue (more on that in a minute). Even all the new additions; The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg; were acted wonderfully. They couldn't have asked for a better cast for this film. In addition to the acting, the fight scenes were very well done. Each time the heroes suited up and went out there to fight, I was thrilled and captivated for the entire length of each fight.<br/><br/>Now...everything else.<br/><br/>The story is soooo bad. Really bad. Trying to make sense of this story and what's going on is like trying to make sense of Watergate. It is a challenge in itself. There are so many parts that felt shoehorned in or scenes that were forced in just to move along the very loose semblance of a story that this film has. It was embarrassing to watch, especially to watch such a talented cast stumble through this themselves. The dialogue certainly doesn't help. Seriously, the dialogue in this film makes the dialogue from Batman & Robin look like an Academy Award winning screenplay, bad Mr. Freeze puns and all. So many bad jokes, so many moments thrown in that I feel they did simply because ""That's what Marvel would do here."" Combine an idiotic story with even worse dialogue, and it's hard to care much for what's going on.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, the special effects were terrible. It felt like I was watching Terminator 3 or The Matrix 3 or name any other special effects driven film from 2003. It didn't look real at all, hell, most video games nowadays looked better than this.<br/><br/>The villain is also very forgettable, which is a tragedy, seeing as how Steppenwolf is a great villain and the entire DCEU thus far has been building towards this epic showdown between Steppenwolf and the League, and Steppenwolf has no motive, barely any (good) dialogue, and dies a very, very forgettable death that, again, felt very forced.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is just a hair above Suicide Squad, a major disappointment, and I'll be giving up on DC movies for a while now, as I crawl back into bed, huddle into a ball, and watch The Batman Animated Series on repeat until DC can figure out what the hell it wants with it's movies. Until then, I'm done.<br/><br/>A 3 out of 10"

"Thekeybaldemasterrises","5","3","8","16 November 2017"," It felt like watching a longer Justice League animated episode and that's totally not a bad thing.
","This movie is heavily flawed. I can definitely see this movie having a longer cut that maybe explains the mythos better. The exposition definitely felt rushed, and the team had to come together a little too quick. But my god this movie is likable and all I can say is finally. I don't know if Zack Snyder got the memo or Joss Whedon saved the day. Whoever it was, they listened and delivered. DC made a coherent movie that's not just about Wonder Woman. I felt like I watched a long episode of JL animated instead of a sequel to Man of Steel or Batman vs Superman. I'm totally fine with that. I feel like for someone not familiar with the DC mythos the exposition could've been fleshed out better in regards to the Mother boxes and the other civilizations like Atlanteens/Amazonian. But everyone was so much fun to watch my problems are just small nitpicks, and they really didn't bother me. Wonder Woman is perfect as always, Batman looked awesome, Aquaman was badass, Flash was hilarious, and Cyborg really surprised! I won't say much on Superman other then he made me tear up a little bit. Go form your own opinion, critics are tearing this movie apart and I think it just had too much to live up to for its previous mistakes. It's overall a fun movie that gives hope for the future of the franchise and I'm very much looking forward to what the DC verse cooks up next. Lots of great Easter eggs in this movie that just shows me they understand what the fans like. I had a blast and I walked out very happy. And that's all I could've hoped for. Don't let Rotten Tomatoes dictate what you should and shouldn't like."
"Dragonsouls","8","3","8","16 November 2017"," Perhaps not the best DC film, but by far the COOLEST!
","(Major spoilers ahead) <br/><br/>Justice League may not be the best DC film but it sure is the coolest of them all and I believe it is the epitome of what a comic book film should be. A good blend of darkness and camp, comedy and philosophy;-inspiration, and loads of eye candy. The action scenes were fantastic, which I'm sure is to be expected in a Justice League film, but what about the other components of the movie? The ones that DC fans were all worried about?<br/><br/>Well, I'll start off by talking about the plot, which many critics have deemed as simple. On the outside it appears that way but many of these characters are used symbolically, especially Superman and Steppenwolf. Superman was beacon for humanity, he represents the hope people have that people need to climb out of despair. After his death, hope for Earth was all but gone, giving rise to the awakening of Steppenwolf, a symbol of Fear and a destroyer of civilizations. <br/><br/>Steppenwolf, basically a reiteration of a devilish figure, was the culprit of the falling of several civilizations in the past, including Atlantis, which if you're familiar with the myth of Atlantis, you'll know that it represents human civilization at its highest peak, both technologically and spiritually. Atlantis' sinking is metaphorical, in that it sank, as in failed, due to misused science and its history is lost and buried. And so Steppenwolf claimed that without Superman (hope) on Earth, Earth is destined to repeat as another fallen human civilization. Our doom is inevitable. <br/><br/>And so as Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince set out to recruit the Metahumans they've been watching, encouraging them to climb out of their shells and trying best to restore their faith in humanity. What I loved about the characterizations in this film is that they rely heavily on anti-social behavior. Whether it'd be Aquaman, Cyborg or Flash, all three of those characters were either jobless, drunks, depressed or recluses. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, as the team gets together, they seemed to gel pretty well together, as they all come to grips with the reasons why they shut down and lost their faith in humanity and also faith in themselves. There was a touching scene between Bruce and Diana, who I swear, seemed really close to kissing in this movie! Aquaman was very snarky in this film, and Momoa is more than just an aesthetic quality, he is a pretty damn good actor. The Flash was a complete neurotic mess and his comedic lines never felt out of place or took away any sense of urgency. And so despite creating such a formidable team, their attempts to thwart Steppenwolf failed, and after losing a battle, Bruce Wayne realizes that one sure thing will be needed to defeat Steppenwolf (fear), and that is Superman. (hope)<br/><br/>The problem is, that he's dead. So how do you bring him back? The same thing that brought Cyborg back from the dead, with a Motherbox. The Motherboxes in this film were representations of technology that could recreate DNA. This story touches heavily on aspects of Transhumanism and the many iterations of superheroes. Whether it'd be Wonder Woman, the old soul, or Aquaman, the man out of time. The Flash, struck by lighting and reborn, and of course Cyborg, a man made superman, who is depicted in a very Frankenstein way in this film. Cyborg warns Bruce that the Motherbox contains the power to write DNA to create humans but it doesn't always get it right, himself being a poster boy for that, in that he considers himself a failed experiment because he has no control of his powers and that his soul is too strong for his body, causing both cellular and nervous breakdown.<br/><br/>And so Bruce's idea of stealing Superman's body and using the Motherbox to rekindle his DNA is dangerous and the result could be something monstrous and not the hero we hoped would return from the dead. But there was no other choice. This is when Justice League really takes off, which is right after Superman's resurrection. Superman stole the show in this film, he was so bad ass that he even made Batman smile. The action in this film, at times, got chaotic, but for the most part, the choreography was sound. Wonder Woman had the best hand to hand combat scenes, Aquaman and The Flash looked great in slow motion, and Batman didn't get a duplicate of his awesome warehouse scene from BVS but he was more of a General in this film, sitting back, barking out commands, and letting his technology do the work for him. <br/><br/>Visually speaking, this is Zack Snyder's magnum opus. There are scenes that are absolutely gorgeous as the team stood side by side, capes billowing in the wind in slow motion;- absolutely beautifully shot and directed. It's really hard to complain about anything in this film, except that it should've been longer. I thought Superman needed an extra scene after his resurrection, to acclimate and deal with the side effects he was feeling. I was hoping for a little more Hans Zimmer music from previous films. Although I admit, the Danny Elfman score is growing on me and so not many complaints. Even the little things I was hoping to see in the movie, such as Superman using his frost breath and the appearance of Green Lanterns, happened!<br/><br/>Final score 9/10. Better than BVS and as heartfelt as Wonder Woman."

It's far from perfect.<br/><br/>Let me start of with things that I've liked first of.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller portrays Flash amazingly well , every scene with him was amazing.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa , really good , but we have seen all of his scenes in a trailer unfortunately.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot same as always , nail their part.<br/><br/>Ray Fisher was probably the best thing along with Ezra about the movie. <br/><br/>Things I disliked and unfortunately there is a whole bunch of them.<br/><br/>Movie starts of with a Superman talking to a camera , you can see it right away how poorly they did the CGI with his mustache , his whole upper lip has been CGIed and you can notice it through out the whole movie , it is quite disturbing. I have been praying that I won't notice it , but I did. Stephenwolf , definitely not the best villain , not a single thing I remember of him that you can say that I was shocked , a huge 8ft tall CGI monster walking around. You can see how many jumps in between the scenes is , same as the theatrical version of BvS , hopefully the extended cut will help us figure things out. There are things you can see it has been done by Zack Snyder , but the whole tone and the colors of the movie and everything about it reeks of Joss Whedon . Also the score for the movie done by Danny Effman , I have no idea how some people were happy about him scoring a movie , he removed everything that was from MoS and BvS and added his own. Not a single song from the movie I picked up in the movie that I liked and that had big impact on me. Justice League looks like a Marvel movie now , not a single remember able song through out the whole movie. Before going into cinema I thought that critics are too harsh and Marvel fan boys are bashing it on purpose. After seeing it , I can totally understand , I had a friend with him going and hes not a fan of comic books , and he unfortunately hated it.<br/><br/>Just when you are expecting a big fight in the end like they had with Doomsday in BvS , the last fight with Stephenwolf , ended in a minute. <br/><br/>I give it a 7/10 because it brought up so many nostalgic memories of the Justice League I grew up with , it's far far far from perfect , is it the best superhero movie of DCU , hardly. <br/><br/>I recommend you watch it at least twice to process and stay through out the credit scenes ,there are two, both of them are really good."
"mkhayes28","Null","3","8","16 November 2017"," Justice League review -may contain spoilers but not really
","Comic book geeks and superhero fans alike have been waiting even drooling over the thought of having a Justice League movie hit the big screen. Well, it's here and this time, director Zach Snyder does not disappoint!<br/><br/>Since Superman (Henry Cavill) died the entire world is still in deep mourning. Everyone except for the criminals. Kal-El's untimely demise is a new opportunity for criminals around the world to wreak havoc, but they are not alone. Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds), an Apokoliptian general, and member of Darkside's Elite, who once tried to claim Earth as his own some thirty thousand years ago but was defeated is now back to what he wants – Earth. To complete his task, he needs to find three ancient weapons known as mother boxes. After his defeat, these well-guarded weapons were divided amongst the Amazons, Atlantians, and the humans and hidden. For thousands of years, the mother boxes have laid dormant. However, with Superman's death, the mother boxes have now awakened. Steppenwolf begins his search to find the mother boxes to reclaim the earth again. This time, there is nothing that can stop him, or so he thinks.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck), has a gut feeling that something alien is going on, but he just hasn't figured it out yet. He enlists the help of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) to help recruit a new team that will ultimately face this new alien threat. Bruce is tasked with two recruits: first, the Scarlet Speedster himself Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller), who is more than happy to accept Bruce's proposition, even before he has a chance to proffer it. Second, the recluse bad boy himself, Author Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa), which proved to be a little more difficult than he expected. Eventually, Bruce accomplished his task. Diana is sent to recruit Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher). This proves to be more of a challenge as he is still coming to terms with his new body and more importantly, he questions Diana's intentions. He doesn't trust Diana. Victor finally comes around and together they set out to defeat Steppenwolf and his paradaemon minions once and for all. It didn't go so well. <br/><br/>The team regroups back at the Batcave and brainstorm about what to do next. While Flash, Cyborg, and Curry are executing their assigned tasks, Bruce, still gripped with the guilt that he caused Superman's death, pushes Diana to become that leader. She is unwilling to accept the role as she is still dealing with her own personal losses, but they come up with a wild idea that will have you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Ever since Director, Zach Snyder has taken the helm of the DC universe, he has had marginal success - Not really having total disasters, but not really knocking it out the park either. His last movie, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, was met with mixed reviews. It was a dark-toned, jumbled mess with a lackluster final battle. The plot and subplots were unclear and seemed rushed as if the writers decided to throw in everything including the kitchen sink. Whether it made sense or not. To make things worse, Marvel's Captain America: Civil War was releasing soon, so the pressure was on. Snyder failed, badly. <br/><br/>With the need to make J.L. correctly, Joss Whedon, who is credited with the success of several Marvel Studio productions, was enlisted to help with post-production duties. With his inclusion, J.L. is everything Batman v Superman should have been. While there are some scenes that were unclear at first, they were all tied up nicely into one cohesive flowing movie. Thank you, Joss! <br/><br/>New comers to the franchise Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher and Jason Momoa are a delight to watch. Miller had small cameos in Suicide Squad and in Batman v Superman. He shines as the young awestruck kid from Central City and brings a comedic flare to what would have been a serious film. Fisher plays the struggling Victor Stone/Cyborg perfectly. The pain, anguish, and confusion he displays while coming to terms with his new body was spot on. Momoa's bad ass Author Curry/Aquaman comes off as a recluse, hell-bent on doing his own thing and could give two shits about man and his problems, ends up having a heart of gold. <br/><br/>What really surprised this writer, is the performance of Gadot. Gadot stepped up her game majorly J.L. Her role as Wonder Woman was more prominent and upfront instead of having a supporting role in the background. Hell, it better be, Wonder Woman is a founding member of the JL. She better get some action and lots of it! After all, she is more than a pretty face- She's Princess Diana of Themyscira. <br/><br/>Watching J.L. will put you in the mindset of another similar superhero movie where they must join together to fight the forces of evil. Hell, if you close your eyes, you won't be able to distinguish the two. <br/><br/>Overall, J.L. is fun and engaging. The action sequences are way better than previous movies where they have been set against a dark backdrop. Not here, each battle is bright and easily seen. Each character gets their share of the action against the bad guys. While there is no mention of the other original Justice League founding members Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter, the movie still flows well. <br/><br/>Grade B <br/><br/>Stick around for two post-credits. The second will blow your mind!"

","Justice League is just terrible... terrible CGI, terrible dialogue, terrible character development, terrible directing, terrible acting, an injustice to the antagonist, and a terrible construct of the protagonist group. It's bad, bland, boring and boo worthy. I don't know what movie the people whom enjoyed JUSTICE LEAGUE watched, but maybe they're just hopeless romantics, and I'm not that. This movie is ugly and silly and easily forgettable."
"smithcaleb-90386","10","4","13","23 November 2017"," By Far my Favorite Superhero Film
","This movie felt like a comic book film. Although there were production issues, this film was still excellent. It felt like a comic book series. It includes comics from Flash, Cyborg, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Unlike Avengers, it doesn't just feel like a team film, but it also feels like a Flash movie at times, a Cyborg movie at times, Batman movie at times, and a Wonder Woman movie. This movie blew my expectations away. This was proof that DC can be better than Marvel. Despite a rocky start, this got the DCU rolling and I'm excited to see more."
"GomezAddams666","8","4","13","16 November 2017"," The Justice League movie we have all been waiting for
","Let me begin by pointing out the flaws I'm just kidding; THIS is the Justice League movie we have all been waiting for!<br/><br/>I think that WB took noticed of the mistakes they made in the past and fixed them, I really liked the fact that the assembling of the league felt organic, and although we didn't know much about half the characters, or this interpretation of the characters they made their introduction the focus of the first act which was definitely a smart move. <br/><br/>The movie has a combination of action pieces with character introductions and developments, by the time the third act comes along you are aware of whom the characters are and you really care for them, I will say the actors and the writers pay an immense tribute to the source materials when it comes to bringing these characters to life.<br/><br/>The movie feels organic and addressing the demon size elephant in the room, yes, you can actually see the input from Joss Whedon, I won't say he saved the movie but the lighter tone and a measured sense of humor were palpable, and it was a great choice to bring him along.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the flaws, I will say some CGI effects were a bit cartoonish and the main villain didn't have a lot of the background development it should have, if you are not aware of the comics the movie will leave you with unanswered questions; and as much as it pains me to say this: Henry Cavill is still a poor choice for Superman, I don't know if he over or under acts, but his performance doesn't feel like Kal-El is trying to blend into society, he feels like a Martian from a 60s movies.<br/><br/>All in all it is a really fun movie, and I give it an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Definitely a MUST watch for comic book fans."
"reeseisacandle","1","5","18","14 May 2020"," Absolutely horrible. A crime to both the film industry and DC comics.
","Initially, I was very excited for this movie. I loved all of the other recent DC hero films that had come out, and DC was a part of my childhood.
However, from the painstakingly long intro to the rushed, horribly done end, and especially during the atrociously written and plot-hole-filled rest of the movie, it was so hard to watch. To call the movie cliché would be a service to it, as it would mean the efforts they made were worth mimicking in some way.
This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and one of - if not THE worst superhero movie I've ever seen.
The antagonist was awful, without any real tact or threat or significance to the rest of the movie - it was like two separate, equally bad and bland movies happening at the same time when the scene would change from one party to the other.
The ""unstoppable villain who can't be even scathed by any single one or more of these talented and powerful heroes, some of which have beaten gods, can only be beaten by Superman who one hit KO's him at the very end of a boring and futile 10 minute fight.""<br/><br/>I will say the plot of them trying to find Superman because they think he's alive is the ONLY okay thing about the movie.
They ruined the characterization of Wonderwoman and others, the filmography was horrendous, the dialogue was cringy and bland, and there were so many plot holes, it'd be easier to just name the couple of things they did right, which is already hard enough.<br/><br/>And yet somehow, even with how bad this movie was overall, it's hardly memorable seeing as it was so bland and boring."

I am a fan, but this movie was CRAP!"
"WeAreLive","7","3","9","30 November 2017"," Ignore the heavily bad reviews
","I have just seen Justice league today and I am actually satisfied with what I have been given. <br/><br/>Gal Godot, Ben Affleck and the rest of the cast as the league members were good as there characters with an exception of Ezra Miller because his face was just plain ugly as Barry Allen, his weird face gave me the creeps and it is weird that when The Flash is running he produces blue electricity instead of yellow. On top of that Ezra didn't look comfortable when he was doing the part.<br/><br/>The effects were amazing it was nice seen some Green Lanterns during a flashback scene again especially seeing them use there rings. I can't wait for who so ever will be Green Lantern in the next movie (if there are more) and Steppenwolfs voice was really good. But the Parademons were a waste and looked like creatures in military suits and I wish we got to see Apocalypse and Darkseid. They could have even played the old Justice League to make the fans happy but too bad they didn't. <br/><br/>Honestly, when I read the reviews at first I was very unsure of going but after when I saw it I was astounded by what I had seen. In fact, the movie actually had funny jokes in a few scenes. <br/><br/>My favorite part was the last battle though I am surprised this movie is only 2 hours long I wish it was longer. But the best part is it is less scary or terrifying compared to a couple of scenes on Batman VS. Superman.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the original Justice League shows and the animated movies then you might enjoy this. It is definitely worth your money. I just hope Zack Snyder doesn't plan on shutting DCEU down because of all the bad reviews. Ignore the jealous morons righting bad reviews about this movie trust me it is not bad or garbage."
"matthewssilverhammer","5","3","9","24 November 2017"," DC's The Avengers
","I went into Justice League, DC'S most recent grab at Marvel's success, with trepidation. Other than Wonder Woman, each DCEU film has left me somewhere between ""meh"" and ""ugh"". Even when Joss Whedon (Avengers) came in to help a grieving Snyder finish the movie, their exponentially different styles worried me, and that worry was mostly found true. Yes, Whedon's wit does bring a welcome shine to the gloomy proceedings, and unlike Batman v. Superman and Suicide Squad, keeps this from being an all-out slog. Still, it's an awkward epic that can't overcome the franchise's dark doldrums. Just like every other superhero movie ever made, a charisma-less and bland villain with limitless power appears, bent on destroying Earth because of ""reasons"". Superman still dead, the world must depend on lesser heroes to save them. Affleck is still a pretty good Batman, Flash is light-hearted fun, Aquaman is kinda cool, Cyborg is dull and dour, and Wonder Woman is still the standout. There are still certainly some interesting moments between the characters, but they're mostly overshadowed by superhero-ethic clichés, stupid drama, bad CGI, and nonsensical logic (why are these guys such quick allies?) There really is just so much that doesn't work: specific jokes, bad visuals, interpersonal relationships, muddy action, plot predictability. The main problem, though, is that DC and Warner Bros. think, through their previous films, they've given us enough reasons to care about this universe, and they haven't. The positives here, mainly just seeing these heroes together on-screen, have left me mildly curious about the future of the franchise, but only barely. Otherwise, Justice League is easily the worst superhero movie of the year."
"brinksace-1","4","3","9","24 November 2017"," So-So
","I went to see movie with no expectations, so in that regard I wasn't disappointed. They should have done movies with the story of the persons alone before throwing them all together. To me it was a very cheap ripoff of the Marvel movies. The bad guy was a Loki wannabe. Cyborg was a joke. But I guess an Iron Man wannabe. That's what he reminded me of. The story was a weak Avenger copy. The Super Man coming back to life was the best part of the movie. That and Flash telling jokes. Wonder Woman was okay in it. Aqua Man was bust. Reminded me of Moana. Batman seems brain damaged. He's supposed to be a genius, but not here. And his outfit, go back to the Michael Keaton one. The Movie was so so, okay not worth seeing in a theater with people talking in it."
"Chiller7","10","3","9","20 November 2017"," Very entertaining from start to finish. A good addition to the DC universe.
","This is a fun, thrilling, and thoroughly entertaining ride that never stops moving along at a brisk exciting pace, full of a cast of super cool & likable heroes. Director Zack Snyder's well deserved reputation for masterclass quality spectacular action and visual imagery is on full display here with the constant onslaught of large-scale epic action & fight scenes.<br/><br/>Highlights: -Wonder Woman's first action scene was ridiculously awesome. -The big action sequences involving the Amazon warriors were pretty epic. -A scene taking place at the memorial park was extremely thrilling (enough said!).<br/><br/>Do not miss the experience of seeing this on the big screen! That said, there are a few caveats that aren't significant enough to affect my score, but I feel should be mentioned.<br/><br/>-Lots of shots seen in the trailers somehow didn't make it into the final movie. Without knowing why those shots were cut, it's hard to tell if this is a bad thing, but it definitely feels like there's potentially a longer (maybe better?) version of this movie out there with additional scenes that we didn't get to see.<br/><br/>-The big bad guy, Steppenwolf, was just kinda... bland. He's a fairly generic two-dimensional villain with limited uniqueness or depth, you know the kind whose whole story and personality can both be summed up with simply that he wants to take over and/or destroy the world. Before you cry foul at why this doesn't lower my rating for the movie, it's that at least his action scenes are still really good, especially his super-thrilling fight against the Amazon warriors - that was a big highlight of the movie - so that at least makes up for what's lacking in his story and personality.<br/><br/>-Danny Elfman's Batman (1989) & Batman Returns (1992) musical scores from back in the day may have been legendary, but his work here was... serviceable at best. Something was missing. This music served simply to set the mood of the scenes, but I didn't find it particularly stand-out or memorable. I'd say it lacked the epic vibe and distinctive themes and raw emotion evoked by the other DC movie composers, Hans Zimmer, Junkie XL (Tom Holkenborg), Rupert Gregson-Williams, & Steven Price. He also repeatedly samples bits of his own past Batman music and John Williams's Superman music, which is questionable, considering how long Hans Zimmer has been composing so many superb DC Batman & Superman themes (since Batman Begins, 2005) and doesn't even get a nod here.<br/><br/>Anyway, that said, watch it. I highly recommend it! Oh, and screw the critics and their snobby attitudes, as usual. If anything, pay more attention to overall audience ratings, such as right here on IMDb, for a 100x more honest consensus than any critics' ratings."

","The movie is just filled with awesomeness. The chemistry between the characters is perfect and the punch lines are perfectly placed. What the best part is that Wonder Woman and Batman are calling most of the shots but the team-work looks great. Action sequences are smooth... The tone is Darker when it is just the Bat otherwise it becomes lighter based on the characters involved.. Love the movie,, No matter what the critics say it is totally worth a watch... I liked the Bale version of Batman but I have found Afflek's version better.. This version looks as well as moves like the Batman from comics and Animated series..,,,"
"mbkalkan","10","3","9","18 November 2017"," A perfect balance (and an old school super hero movie)
","Viewers nowadays want excessive action, and they want it fast. Right from the beginning, until the very end. Films which do not deliver to fulfill this premise somewhat inevitably fall behind in movie-goers' perceptions, however strong they may be in dramatic aspects or character development (At least that is how I personally see it). Many action movies, thrillers, fantasy films are regarded less favorably than they should actually be, because of this simple fact. And, in my humble opinion, Justice League may well end up becoming one of those flicks which deserve a higher accolade than that which will be attributed to it.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the film balances action, drama, humor and character development in just the right way that befits such a huge comic dynasty, especially given the fact that half the characters were relative unknowns for those people who only go to movies adapting comic books, but do not read the respective comics themselves. In Avengers, this was quite the opposite, since all major characters were introduced in separate movies that came before it and hence provided a basis for story development.<br/><br/>In Justice League, this is not quite so. Therefore the first half of the movie basically serves as a platform for introducing the characters while also developing the story in the process. The second half, however, really delivers all the elements that you may require from such a movie.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an old school super hero movie, which pays a great deal of attention to story and coherence, and as such is the best DC Comics movie adaptation so far.<br/><br/>You just have to sit back, enjoy the pace of the movie as it comes to you, and savor the different characters as they are presented to you. Just be patient, and do not treat the movie as a ""fast-food"" adaptation of a great comic book dynasty. You will be glad that you did in the end."

This was so amazing, so thank you to you and absolutely everyone that helped bring this to the screen.<br/><br/>Here we go: <br/><br/>Thor cutting his hair shows how much respect Marvel has for their fans.<br/><br/>Meanwhile at DC, BvS was an answer to the fans about how they felt about Man of Steel, and this film was the answer to how they felt about BvS.<br/><br/>This film was absolutely amazing. That is everything but the score, but you don't really have much time to think about the score.<br/><br/>First off, this is Batman. Batman is Batman ALL the time. Ben Affleck is Batman. If you have a problem with him, you really just don't like Batman when it comes down to it.<br/><br/>This film was a lot like what we see in the comics, the series and Injustice. It completely captured the spirit of every character.<br/><br/>They did not butcher the characters with overwhelming humor like Marvel has for example Thor, whom if you've seen the new film was like a live action Lego film, just no regard for the character.<br/><br/>Justice League came together quite well. I'm so surprised at how happy and amazed I am that something out of Hollywood could be so true to DC comics.<br/><br/>I'm very much looking forward to this League of Villains and Darksied!"
"sefrafer","9","3","9","17 November 2017"," This is the True Dawn of the Justice
","Justice League after the mixed opinions of the people by Batman v Superman and after Wonder woman was a success he had his doubts about a film where a team was formed without making individual films first, and I do not know if it is the fan inside ò the boy who lived with episodes and episodes of such a great animated series, but I just can not hate this movie, love every moment I saw, but with respect to this ensemble, the film is an amalgam between two creative minds, one visual and the other arguments, and it is noticeable when one began and the other ends, it is noticeable when the film falters and it is in the CGI, the visual effects are good at the moment, then as they fail and this is noticeable in his villain steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds) because of moments see well other moments like no, Cyborg (Ray Fisher) also suddenly notice the very simple effects, regarding the plot is simpler and easier to digest something that many discussed from earlier I think it goes more in a straight line and that can help you not feel boring, on the contrary it is very entertaining and fun and having humor is not synonymous with bad jokes or comedy every five minutes, there is a balance in this however there are some holes that leave you in doubt if that was still missing or explain something and this is due to two factors the first is Warner not wanting to risk making a movie that lasts more than two hours and the second is that the change of director did not help at all with the final edition, even with these flaws there is something that makes one of those mistakes forget and is what we come to see the league of justice, the chemistry between the actors is amazing it is seen as a fairly united family that get along well you want and want to see more of them in action everyone makes their excellent role Ben affleck is Batman, Gal Gadot is still the amazing Wonder Woman, Ezra miller is an excellent Flash you just can not not love him, Jason Momoa takes over a rude Aquaman and dive As you feel like watching your individual movie, Ray Fisher as Cyborg maybe the weakest link but still the plot works for him and Henry Cavill as Superman is the hero that everyone expected him to be is the boy- scout that fans asked for, the band sound of Danny Elfman is very much in line with the situations, nothing memorable (except for his batman theme and the classic theme of superman) but still very present in the scenes, without a doubt this movie I loved, I would see the times they were because it has the essence of heroism that was needed that fun and charm that had the animated series, the animated movies, an era of heroes is coming and this was the prologue of better moments."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","7","3","9","17 November 2017"," Better than BvS and Suicide Squad. But it ain't Wonder Woman.
","Justice League is... an aggressively okay film. It's a well-meaning, sometimes conflicted and overly ambitious film that's going to be looked back upon as one of the notable but less memorable films of the superhero era of cinema. It's like a burger from McDonald that is produced in an assembly line fashion: pets of the burger are genuinely good and well- made, but the sum of its parts does introduce problems that does bring down the experience of eating it while admitting it was still an okay meal in the end despite some of the pets affecting the product.<br/><br/>Justice League essentially boils down to this: it's Batman mixed with The Avengers. Outside of Batman, Wonder Woman and The Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman and Superman don't truly find their footing in this film. But the Man of Steel does brighten things up when he IS introduced later on. Aquaman is fun but we don't get enough of him to see why he's different to Batman and the others. We're introduced to these potentially monumental characters only for their potential to be deliberately left over for future sequels to the Justice League Movie.<br/><br/>In the end, this is WB's Avengers and while it could have been something more than that, it doesn't really try pretending to be anything else. That is part of the problem but I enjoyed myself just fine. It's inoffensive fun that shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's a perfectly okay movie.<br/><br/>I'm guessing Dunkirk, IT and Blade Runner 2049 put less pressure on Warner Brothers to make Justice League the be-all-and-end-all film it was originally being made out to be. Enjoy it for what it is: men in tights fighting and saving the world for two hours. Nothing more; nothing less."
"regula1","7","3","9","16 November 2017"," Justice Has Dawned, But It's A Mixed Bag
","While there's no cringe-worthy dialogue akin to Will Smith saying ""So are we some kind of Suicide Squad?"" but this film as a whole toes that line between awesome and passable.<br/><br/>This film fulfills the promise made by Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne/Batman at the end of Batman v. Superman: to bring together the other meta humans of Earth to fight a threat greater than any one of them could face alone. However, if you thought the character development of the three other heroes besides Wonder Woman was lacking in BvS' email attachments, it doesn't get much better in this film.<br/><br/>Yes, we see Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman, and he definitely rejects the lame stereotype his character has been weighed down by for decades. Yes, we get to meet Barry Allen/The Flash, and Ezra Miller does a fun take on the character to complement the job Grant Gustin has been doing on the CW show. Yes, we get to finally have a proper look at Victor Stone/Cyborg, and for Ray Fisher's first major film, he does a pretty good job.<br/><br/>The problem lies with the fact that this film can't shake the feeling that it's just an inferior version of The Avengers. Unlike The Avengers, though, where each main team member had its own film to flesh out their character and motivations and build towards a villain the whole while, this film came before that stage. Wonder Woman had her fantastic origin story, and Heny Cavill's Superman had his film as well, but all the other heroes have yet to be fleshed out properly, and it shows.<br/><br/>The action is by far the best aspect of this film. It's what I expected going in to this film, mainly great action and just enough plot for the change in scenery between fight scenes to make some sort of sense. We get that, and it's great.<br/><br/>The problem then comes from the plot itself, specifically the villain Steppenwolf, who is the main catalyst for the formation of the Justice League. Never mind his name alone brings to mind magic carpet rides being born to be wild, the full CGI character looks terrible for a big budget film. Plus, while his motivations are explained, barely, and full of clichés, his minions the Parademons fall into the same category as Enchantress' minions from Suicide Squad, a disposable CGI army to distract the heroes before facing the main enemy. Their creation, from the bodies of fallen enemies, holds fantastic promise but is never utilized.<br/><br/>In short, this film is good in that it is fan wish fulfillment done properly, and has some great character moments between action sequences. I for one can't wait to see the solo Aquaman film. How much of the witty banter throughout is due to Joss Whedon taking over for Zach Snyder we may never know, but it is a welcome addition and blends in seamlessly.<br/><br/>If you were let down by BvS and Suicide Squad but Wonder Woman had you crying for joy, this film will land somewhere in between. Check it out and see for yourself, but just know it's a dent in the DCEU's seemingly upward trajectory."

"letande","8","3","9","16 November 2017"," Zack Snyder did learn, but man, The Flash is awful.
","Zack Snyder did learn. And this time he made almost perfect DC movie. Almost. Like Wonder Woman before it, Justice League does feel like a proper comics-based thing. It isn't too dark with no reason like those Superman movies, there isn't too many religion stuff, dialogues aren't really cheesy, the battles are made in a right and exciting way... It's just as you want your DC movie. Stylish, cool and exciting.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are some things that ruined it to me. A lot. First of all, the plot is way too basic. I know, I know, it's a superhero movie, ""let's get together"" one too, so plot isn't really important here. Just put a lot of familiar faces together and make them fight. For justice. And that'll be it. But... somehow you can't help, but to want more.<br/><br/>The whole movie is literally made of three parts. The first one is a quick introduction of characters. The second part is all about Superman's return. Not really a spoiler, it was spoiled for oh so many times in previous movies and trailers, so... Anyway, yeah, one part is all about Clark and Lois. And finally, there's that cool big battle everybody wanted. One, two, three. It's just like that. In other words, really, REALLY basic stuff. Not the biggest problem out there, bu-u-ut... you know.<br/><br/>The second problem is Lantern. I mean, come on! Justice League without Green Lantern?! Give me a break. It just can't be right. This problem is still fixable, though. There's a certain obvious scene in this movie that will probably lead into a new Green Lantern movie in a future, which, of course, will mean that he WILL be in the next Justice League, so... Fixable. But still, it didn't really feel OK to me to see Justice League without Lantern. It was more like Justice League Origins, or Justice League Zero... But Justice League with no Lantern... No. Just no. So, problem number two - needs more Lanterns.<br/><br/>I can live with most of that, though. What really ruined the movie to me is... The Flash. Dear GOD, he's awful. He isn't just bad, or something... He's just... A-W-F-U-L. Absolutely, completely AWFUL. Ezra Miller is literally THE worst thing EVER happened with The Flash. There's literally EVERYTHING wrong with The Flash in this movie. EVERYTHING. Zack Snyder's team turned Barry Allen into a clown. And not into a scary Pennywise-like clown, but into a stupid and cowardly one. Yes, I know, the movie covers Barry's early stages as a hero and it totally needed some sort of funny character to bring some fun in, but come... freakin'... on... After absolutely brilliant Flash from the TV series (played by Grant Gustin) they gave us THIS. You can't even call The Flash a proper character here. He's a tool! He's Jar Jar Binks! HE IS JAR JAR BINKS! I'm not kidding or overreacting here. He's LITERALLY Jar Jar in this movie. He acts EXACTLY the same and everything he says is as ""cool"" as what Jar Jar says and does. Just think about it, guys... In this movie... we have... Jar Jar Flash. Jar Jar... freakin'... Flash... Man, I hate that. And to make things (much) worse Ezra Miller's acting is EXTREMELY bad. And THAT I didn't expect. I mean, he was pretty much OK in the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, so, I really thought that he was chosen because he's a good actor. But guess what? Nope. He's the only one who literally fails to act here. You can clearly see it in one of the prison scenes, for example. I mean... he's bad in every single scene, but that one was serious, so, you can clearly see how bad he is there. He's just bad in every way possible. Remember how Wonder Woman saved Batman v Superman? It was pretty bad movie and near the end it was hard to force yourself to keep watching, but then BOOM! Wonder Woman theme played, Gal Gadot appeared and everybody was like OMG OMG OMG!!! With Justice League it's exactly the opposite. We have a pretty good and exciting movie, but EVERY SINGLE TIME there's The Flash on screen, you want just say ""Screw it!"" and leave.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the others were good. Amy Adams was great as usual, Henry Cavill still does a very solid Superman, Ben Affleck still isn't the worst Batman out there, Ray Fisher turned out to be ideal choice for Cyborg, Jason Momoa actually surprised me by doing nice as Aquaman, while Gal Gadot... OK, OK, I kinda became a fanboy by now, but come on, I think everybody should agree that she's just fantastic Wonder Woman! She's just perfect for this role and everything she does is perfect. And there's a lot of her too, so, if you're like me and going to see this movie just because you loved Gal Gadot in the previous DC movie, you're in for a treat, guys. Go and see it, even if it's only for Gal Gadot, it's still worth it.<br/><br/>What else? The effects were pretty solid, 3D was OK, music was cool (loved how many old themes were included, it was really nice to hear 1989 Batman theme again) and I loved the song that played during the credits. I won't spoil it to you, but I loved the idea, even though it was a cover and not even the best one.<br/><br/>So... that's it. The Justice League. I must say I'm glad I decided to see it. With different Flash it'll be really cool movie, but even as is it's pretty nice. I mean, it's nice to see the DC movie that doesn't suck for a change, right? Ah, and don't leave the theater too fast. There are two after credits scenes here. The first one is just for fun, but the second one is REALLY important."

","""The whole is greater than the sum of its parts""<br/><br/>This quote represents the opposite of what the final product called ""Justice League"" came out to be. It had some great moments, but as a whole, the final product was not intact. It had some hits and misses. <br/><br/>The hits = seeing the full team together, most of the action sequences, some of the naturally funny moments (Superman watching Flash as he tried to use the speed force to sneak behind him), scenes in Gotham, the post credit scenes<br/><br/>The misses = the reshot scenes (one in particular is when Barry makes the joke about brunch, that was obviously reshot, that piece of the scene looked out of place), I know that WB doesn't want to continue the darkness of BvS, but that doesn't mean that things have to be really bright (Superman's suit went from navy blue to almost aqua blue), forced comedy (ex. brunch joke), not much in story development, not much in character development, there were some odd scene cuts that made it look out of place (the cut to the history lesson was choppy), and with $300 million to spend, the CGI should be wayyyy better<br/><br/>Bottom Line = with an estimated $300 million budget, this movie should be near perfect, NO EXCUSES!!!<br/><br/>To be honest, I went into the theater with high expectations, and left feeling underwhelmed. It felt like WB just wanted to rush thru this movie and just show the ""good parts."" But, to its credit, Justice League is a fun movie that many regular movie goers will enjoy."
"aminbaha","7","3","9","16 November 2017"," Went in knowing reviews are mixed, still ended up liking it.
","It's far from a bad movie. It's just that scenes doesn't flow nicely. You'll definitely notice when scenes just look incomplete, like it's missing a follow up or a backstory. Nothing to love about the soundtrack. Steppenwolf is okay. Generic villain, but I enjoyed seeing him kicking ass on screen. It's just that..you wish he'd bring more pain, u know what i mean?<br/><br/>CGI, nothing worth criticizing or applauding. It's OK. If you TRY to find weird, out-of-place CGI, you'll find it. But if you just attune your mind to enjoying the movie, you won't notice anything weird.<br/><br/>The league themselves are great. Flash's jokes are a hit and miss, but it fits his character. Didn't thought I'd say this, but I loved cyborg. Ray Fischer did a great job. I was worried that aquaman would be the one-liner guy, but he's great as well. Gordon, Alfred, WW, Batman, Flash's dad, all great as usual. Last but not least, superman. BADASS.<br/><br/>Since BVS and WW is the benchmark for DC movies nowadays, i'll just say this. I hated BVS. It made me physically mad. Although JL is not as good as WW, but I had more fun with JL.<br/><br/>Summary : Enjoyed it a lot. Has its flaws, but definitely worth the wait. I might get crucified for this but..........i liked it more than avengers *runs away"
"MrDHWong","7","3","9","15 November 2017"," Feels more like a Marvel film rather than a DC film, which is both a good and a bad thing
","Justice League is the fifth installment in the DC Extended Universe superhero franchise. Directed by Zack Snyder, the film shows that along with Wonder Woman, DC may be experiencing something of a resurgence in 2017, but still has a fair way to go before they have truly caught up with Marvel.<br/><br/>A short time after the events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck), along with his ally Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), decide to form a group of heroes to combat a new enemy. This team, in addition to Bruce and Diana themselves, includes Arthur Curry/Aquaman (Jason Momoa), a superhuman with aquatic abilities, Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller), a young man who can move at super fast speeds, and Victor Stone/Cyborg (Ray Fisher), a cybernetically reconstructed former athlete with the ability to manipulate technology.<br/><br/>Fast paced and generally lighthearted, Justice League feels more like a standard Marvel Cinematic Universe film rather than an actual DC film, which is both a good and a bad thing. It's good because it allowed the film to be more entertaining and fun with its action and humour, and it's bad because it doesn't exactly feel original in that sense. I believe Joss Whedon is the one responsible for this different approach. The musical score, composed by Danny Elfman, was quite impressive, almost as though he was referencing his days of composing for Tim Burton's Batman films. The villain, Steppenwolf, was nothing more than another forgettable CGI bad guy with generic world domination tendencies, which is pretty much on par with most early Marvel villains. The new heroes were introduced reasonably well, but it felt as though their proper backstories are being shelved for their upcoming solo films. Aquaman and The Flash provide some decent comic relief during some fight scenes but Cyborg felt somewhat underused. Like with Marvel films and unusual for a DC film, be sure to stay after the credits for two bonus scenes.<br/><br/>I rate it 7/10"
"emkay905","1","6","24","20 November 2017"," Extremely Underwhelming
","Having gone in with low expectations already, this movie still managed to be a massive disappointment, and this is coming from someone who came out of suicide squad thoroughly entertained until eventually realising it was a piece of sh*t. This movie is just straight up sh*t even coming fresh out of it. Wonder Woman proves to be a one hit wonder for the DCEU as Zack Synder and Chris Terrio's script continues to prove that they do not know what they're doing at all or perhaps it's WB's poor handling of the movie that ultimately made the experience dull and boring. This film had potential to be good, the plot itself was decent but the execution was sloppy and felt extremely rushed, running at around a mere 2hrs, this was a film which needed to spend more time developing its heavily underdeveloped plot. I want to see this movie again but without studio interference, the ultimate edition/director's cut has potential to be great. Zack may have made a good movie here but studio interference may have just fuck3d it up<br/><br/>Firstly to address the positives of this movie, the heroes are great, they were all very likable and were enjoyable to watch on screen, the chemistry between them was a stand out part, they made a great team. The story itself was also decent, though formulaic and the post credits scene was an amazing set up, it was my favourite part of the entire movie.<br/><br/>Moving on to the negatives now, Aquaman was a completely negligible character who was just kinda present with his pitch fork but never really did much, The flash had too many ham-fisted jokes, like Jesus i get it he's an outsider you don't have to constantly remind me of that. Ezra Miller did a good job in my opinion, and his character has potential, the flashpoint movie has potential to be good just keep Chris and Zack away from the story. The god awful CGI completely threw me off at times, close ups of Steppenwolf and Cyborg and Superman's edited out mustache was done so poorly and proved to be extremely distracting and took me out of the movies at times. The story also has terrible pacing, too much is happening in such a short amount of time, i thought i was watching multiple movies at the same time in the recruitment part of the movie, it just felt too disjointed and didn't flow very well. The film/story is also just way too short, i was surprised when i realised the movie was about to end because i felt as if the story could have been further developed, my realisation of the villain being defeated was of shock as i had expected some more complications to arise before the final act of the movie came together however it turns out THAT WAS INDEED THE FINAL ACT. The complication and resolution for this story is too formulaic and very disappointing there's nothing special there to discuss. <br/><br/>I myself adore DC, however this film is embarrassing, especially when the best part of the movie is the 30 second post credits scene. If you want to see a good Justice League movie, you're better off watching DC's animated work which is done much better than this poorly paced and executed mess. <br/><br/>Hopefully WB fixes the DCEU before they do the Justice League vs Darkseid story because i really don't want to be let down again like this."

","Joss Whedon is a C+ director that did a decent job with Avengers and Avengers Ultron. However, his action sequences in JTL lack imagination. The fight scenes emulate his work on Buffy the Vampire and it's hard to watch. He doesn't have the attention to detail in directing that Snyder has. iE. that Batman warehouse scene in BvS is epic compare any Batman scene in JTL or any fight scene. Josstice League is horrible and I can't wait for the Snyder cut."

"Abranth-d","7","2","5","19 July 2019"," Had it's flaws but still works
","So it finally happened , the greatest heroes finally united and I got to see it first hand . Here's my review of JUSTICE LEAGUE . So Zack Snyder did his take on finally uniting the league with a bit of Joss whedon's touch then and there. What this movie did was correct all the mistakes from bvs , like constantly brooding characters and bad edited fights. They even got batman right . I'm not the biggest supporter of batfleck , but with a little character tone down and a better 'not so buff' suit , he did great. Gal gadot was great as wonder woman and her screen space was right. Ezra miller was close to perfect as the flash , considering his new take being more like the mcu's current spiderman and him using the speed force was gold ! Jason momoa was good as aquaman , but he should have gotten more screen time . now the whole movie is very light hearted and is very different form the other dceu movies , but light hearted in a not so cheesey way . Steppenwolf wasn't such a great villain , but hey they're saving Darkseid for the best , and a less intimidating villain is what we need for the team to unite. The biggest problem with this movie is the CGI and that's probably due to switching between directors and stopping production in the middle , and cyborgs suit was pretty revealing , and that too was fixed in the end in a good way .Throughout the movie , there was just one civilian family and that was pretty annoying. Now the most important thing a team up movie needs is good music , sure there were quick references to the classic batman theme and the wonder woman theme , but the overall soundtrack wasn't that good as the album songs from white stripes and godsmack . This movie gave quick glimpses to the lanterns and Shazam and some real hype giving post and end credits scenes. So yeah , justice league had its flaws but it was so entertaining that you don't look much to pick on it. In the end , justice league came out right , with legendary characters , heart pumping easter eggs , fan screaming moments and one big ticket to the hall of justice."

","This is one of those films I felt weird about the first time I saw it because of how excited I was before it's release. I don't know if I've ever been this pumped for a movie before. Then the director changed, then the runtime shortened, and I was still excited, albeit cautiously.<br/><br/>Once I saw this film the first time, I liked it, though I may have just been blinded by my excitement for the film, and the IMAX presentation.<br/><br/>But once I saw it twice more, it's flaws began to stare me in the face, the reshoots became considerably more noticable, the effects & the colour grading became worse, and the awful attempts at humour annoyed me.<br/><br/>While still a mildly enjoyable film in it's own right, it is nowhere near the scale and weight that the trailers and the original word of mouth toted about. It was no-longer this huge sci-fi epic with genuine character growth, it was a tone-deaf attempt at making a Marvel movie with these beloved DC characters.<br/><br/>Unlike 'Batman v Superman', a movie I love the more I watch & disect it, this was a movie I disliked the more I watched & dissected it. It leaves a huge dark mark on my memories, and I wish that the full Director's Cut of this film could be released one day so that dark mark can finally be washed away."

","This movie could've been really good and a beacon for superhero movies, at least an 8.
But it was just too much. Everywhere.
Too much CGI by a bit, undercutting any weight the scenes had. Batman was just a little bit too pathetic. Flash's backstory was just a little bit too awesome for the pathetic nerd. The superman part was just a bit too dumb but important. The badguys voice was just a bit too growly to understand.<br/><br/>
In either case on the cusp of the third decade in the 21st century CGI with this quality is inexcusable.
And the worst part is one could clearly see that all this was lovingly and nicely crafted, incuding bits of the CGI.<br/><br/>A special mention goes to whoever wrote Flash's and Cyborg's parts. They were witty, charming, but relatable unlike most of the over-the-top heroes. in both marvel and DC."

Spoilers ahead! <br/><br/>First in case i sounded like a marvel fanboy I'm not. I enjoyed several DC films such as Smallville, most of the batman films especially when played by heath ledgers. However, something changed in DC a few years ago and now they mostly roll out garbage such as batman vs superman, man of steal, the suicide squad, this movie, etc. Etc. Etc.! The fanboys who rated this highly should be ashamed for Heavens sake there is a scene where superman flies his girl to a farm so she can tell him he smells good. This was so blatantly ripped from avengers 1. There was another scene where flash ran around doing nearly the exact same thing quicksilver did in x-men days of future past. The list goes on. Now plenty of movies mimic others but I have never seen one that so blatantly and poorly does it while trying to pretend it's original.

","The amount of reviewers scoring it the lowest possible is ridiculous. The lowest possible rating means it's one of the worst movies you ever saw in your life, and in this case that means you almost never watch movies or you're just an annoying little prick that thinks he knows everything better. Don't get me wrong, everyone is entitled to his opinion but please just stay fair. Justice League doesn't deserve a 10 star rating, far from, but also not a 1 star rating. I wanted some easy entertainment, and that's what I always want when watching a superhero movie, and that's exactly what I got. It doesn't matter if it is a Marvel or a DC superhero, I enjoy both if the movie is okay. Putting the Detective Comics superheroes Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, AquaMan and Flash together in a battle against Steppenwolf is to me a nice concept for a story. The CGI's were what to expect with such a high budget. The cast was also okay even if I'm not a big fan of Ben Affleck. Gal Gadot on the other hand is candy for the eye. So after all this said, yes there are better superhero movies, even much better, but Justice League is certainly not the worst movie ever like some grumpy people on here wants to make you believe. It's worth watching if you like some easy entertainment and you like superheroes and vilains."

Each excellent character had their time to shine & all had great chemistry together, Also the music score was Awesome. Steppenwolf was yes all c.g.i but looked & sounded excellent!!! The voice was great & perfectly fit the ancient character. All the action was great fun & the sewer scene with Batman's Awesome Nightcrawler vehicle was FANTASTIC!!! There's lots of great gems all through the movie, from great scenes to great character bits there's so many great parts, The Parademons look great, Lots more good things in this movie than bad things? So if you like it, just like it & forget all the hate!!! I totally enjoyed this as a big budget fun fantasy adventure & that's exactly what it was. ""The Flash"" kinda stole the show as the funny younger hero & his own flash theme is beautiful. Totally Awesome fun & very underrated. Also BEN AFFLECK is still the absolute BEST batman & bruce Wayne we have EVER HAD!!!
""Aquaman"" is excellent & ""Wonder women"" is again fantastic & really holds the group together as the big heart of this rag tag team, the only character that didn't really get alot of depth was ""Cyborg"" as i did hear he was supposed to be the main arc or heart of the movie but had lots of scenes cut so that impacted his character part.
""Superman"" becomes the ""Real"" superman in this movie, he become the comic book style icon.
The cast is excellent!!!<br/><br/>Steppenwolf is one of the greatest movie villains I've seen in along time especially in big fantasy comic book films!!!!
""Justice league"" is an easy10/10!!!
I've been really enjoying the DC universe movies & I've followed these more than the ""Marvel"" films but i love both franchises.
DC films rated so far:
""Man of Steel"" 9/10
""Batman vs Superman"" 10/10
""Suicide squad"" 9/10
""Wonder Woman"" 9/10
""Justice league"" 10/10

""Harley Quinn & The Birds of Prey"" 9/10<br/><br/>Justice league is just a big budget action-packed,funny fantasy adventure!!! Would've loved it if this came out in the 90's & i saw it as a kid,

Henry Cavil, aka Supermanwas in another movie where he had a mustache and the director would not allow him to shave it, so what does DC do? Well they spend 3 million dollars on CG to get it removed and it looks god awful. Anyways talking about CG it's looks absolutely terrible in this movie. Not one scene with any CG in it looked realistic, and this movie has one of the biggest budgets of any movies, ever! The plot honestly made me want to off myself. I don't want to say anything about except that it is so idiotic and will baffle you. And please don't start with the acting. The only believable actor is Ben Affleck (besides the fact that the DCEU has screwed Batman) and the actor who plays Cyborg. The villain is the somehow more forgettable than the villain from any man. He is so forgettable I honestly don't remember his name and he is supposed to be capable of deystroying the world.

It really differentiated DC from MARVEL it is important to realise that both universes are different thus the fact that WB copies them in making unnecessary changes and decisions is why i can't keep my mouth shut. I really HOPE that in the future with Aquaman, flash, Batman and etc. They take back the road they chose from the beginning(Zack Snyder). I love the way he paints his ideas onto the films. And makes us feel related with the characters. I know that for example superman should be more hopeful, and etc. But it is a universe that it's starting and the characters can evolve.

I liked the connection between Diana and Bruce.<br/><br/>Superman is back in a big way!! Henry Cavill finally feels like the real Man of Steel that we all know and love!! This is the Superman that I've been waiting for since 2006's Superman Returns. Cavill's Superman was finally confident, secure, hopeful, optimistic...it's like he's had a personality overall, in a good way! Clark and Lois had great chemistry, and it was great seeing Martha rejoice at Clark's return. I also enjoyed Danny Elfman's soundtrack , especially the original Batman theme and the original Superman theme.<br/><br/>I thought the film did a pretty good job at introducing Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg but sometimes the humor felt forced and the bonding of the team didn't always work for me. Steppenwolf was a one-dimensional villain , and the ending fight between Superman and Steppenwolf should have been longer. The CGI on Superman's face was a HUGE distraction, ugh. <br/><br/>So this movie isn't perfect, but I find many of the criticisms of this movie to be empty and baseless. So many complained about Zack Snyder and Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, saying they were joyless, too serious, too dark, too long, etc. Now they criticize Justice League for being the opposite, for being fun, light-hearted, joyful, and positive. Some fans can't be satisfied.<br/><br/>Overall I absolutely enjoyed Justice League and I can rest assured that my kids will actually cheer for Superman and Batman in this one. <br/><br/>Positive. Optimistic. Happy. Finally, WB gets it right! Justice League is the anti-Batman v Superman...and I'm so glad!!"
"audacity10","1","2","5","11 January 2018"," What a mess
","There's a recurring trend with Zack Snyder movies where they turn out absolutely awful, then the comic/movie community rally round in support claiming his ""vision"" was lost due to interference. <br/><br/>As far as I'm aware, this sort of interference happens to almost every director, but Snyder seems totally able to absolve himself of responsibility for continuously making steaming heaps of garbage movies with huge amounts of money at his disposal.<br/><br/>If indeed there is a good film lying on the cutting floor, chopped out by Joss Whedon, it must make up an almost entirely different movie. And the same was said of Batman Vs Superman where a director's cut was released with the Blu-ray, which while it improved the film, it couldn't remove the terrible parts such as Jesse Eisenberg's depiction of Lex Luther or Henry Cavill's amateurish portrayal of Superman.<br/><br/>And I'm glad this film flopped. The opening ten minutes was so filled with anti-white propaganda, as we see in all big-budget movies now, I was ready to leave the cinema. Maybe I should have because the next 90% was cheap-looking action CGI with stints of boring/unfunny dialogue.<br/><br/>I won't be attending anymore Snyder/superhero movies. My money is too hard worked for to spend on this tripe."

","This is a fantasy adventure. Batman is assembling an alliance of superheroes to fight a cosmic threat, which he believes is coming to Earth soon. The approaching villain character is 'Steppenwolf', who is in search of three mystical 'mother boxes.' These boxes are currently in the possession of the Amazons, Atlanteans and humans and are hidden in secret locations around the world.<br/><br/>The boxes hold great power but need to be located and then combined.<br/><br/>The hero characters all have good chemistry, in their banter with each other and their high action battles scenes.<br/><br/>I generally enjoyed this film though there was very heavy use of CGI, so much so it resembled a computer video game.

","I grew up with DC and Marvel comics. My favorite DC super heroes are Superman (I loved Reeves and Cavill), Wonder Woman and Batman. My favorite Marvel super heroes are Iron Man, Spider Man and Thor. I've watched every movie that featured my favorite superheroes. I wasn't pleased with the third installment of Thor it was pure garbage! However, the critics praised Thor and gave the Justice League poor reviews. Why are the so called critics so hard on DC movies? People, do not listen to the critics. We are intelligent, we can decide if we like a movie. By the way, Justice League was an excellent movie!<br/><br/>My friend and I loved Justice League! I simply loved the time that's given to Wonder Woman. She totally did her thing in this movie. The introduction of the Flash was great! The Flash totally delivered the comedy. Superman was the best! The fight scenes were awesome. I wished they did more character development on Cyborg and Aquaman. By the way, ladies, Aquaman is great eye candy! That body! Okay I got off track.<br/><br/>Everyone in the theater loved Justice League! This movie is so good I am going to see it again. Forget the critics and see this movie."

"seige-hound","5","2","5","22 November 2017"," Rushed, weirdly paced, mixed bag, tonally inconsistent
","So...this movie exists.<br/><br/>So I think comparing this film to The Avengers is apt since they are both ensemble superhero films, and Joss Whedon has writing credits on both of them.<br/><br/>Here's the issue:<br/><br/>The MCU made sure all relevant characters were properly introduced in their own films before putting them together in the Avengers. Thor, Iron Man, Captain America and Hulk had their own movies with their own story arcs and character development. Say what you want about the quality of the individual films, but the fact that they pulled it off as good as they did is impressive, to say the least.<br/><br/>Now for the DCEU, we got Man of Steel, Batman V Superman, and Wonder Woman. I'm not counting Suicide Squad since that is barely relevant to the rest of them and none of the major characters there are present in Justice League. So the DCEU Batman didn't get his own flick. You can argue that Batman V Superman is a Batman movie, but it doesn't really feel like it. Neither Batman or Superman really fit as the main protagonist. It's all pretty jumbled. Wonder Woman worked, but that was because they didn't have Zach Snyder messing around too much, and it was its own thing for the most part. But we still had the Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman to develop in Justice League, in a relatively small timeframe of 2 hours (compared to the epic 3 hour Batman V Superman) <br/><br/>To be fair to the writers, they did a decent job with the new characters. Flash is funny and likable. Aquaman is also pretty fun, albeit less developed. Cyborg is sort of boring, but he has some room to develop later.<br/><br/>The story though is just...what??? The MCU did a great job introducing the broader conflicts of the Avengers within the smaller movies. In Thor, they introduce a few McGuffins, and they did the same in Captain America 1, so that when you see them in the Avengers, it makes sense.<br/><br/>The Avengers also made Loki, a character we've seen before, the main villain of the story. We know who he is, and what his motivations are before the story begins, so we aren't confused. Meanwhile, who the hell is Steppenwolf? Where did he come from, why is he terraforming the world? (Earth seems to get terraformed a lot in this universe) I haven't read the comics, I don't know who he is. He's doing the same thing as Zod in MoS, and he looks like Ares. It's derivative. The bug-minions are pretty neat, but who cares about them, really?<br/><br/>Also, spoilers, Superman comes back to life. Contrary to my expectations, they sort of retcon the ending of Batman V Superman (where the dirt on Superman's coffin begins to float) by having the Justice League actively resurrecting Superman using the cube things, but once again, that part is rushed. Superman is evil for 5 minutes, but then Lois comes along and calms him down and then he's good again.<br/><br/>Superman is actually fun in this one though and is less mopey. Probably because he was dead for a while and was brought back. Hopefully, they keep that character element in later films.<br/><br/>Yes, I have a lot of issues with this film, but I do think it's a step in the right direction for the franchise. It's more fun compared to the other dark gritty nonsense. We've got set up for new interesting characters, including a sneak peek at the Green Lantern Corps. I want to see a Flash movie and an Aquaman movie. I think both of those characters need a lot more to do. Cyborg, sure why not. I also want to see Shazam, and whatever other silly characters DC wants to do.<br/><br/>The box office returns for this film were lower than expected, apparently. I think DC needs to do a bit of corporate restructuring (aka fire Snyder) and hire some good writers, but after that, fingers crossed, we can start seeing DC movies match up to the same standards (or even higher) as the MCU."
"tommystans","4","2","5","21 November 2017"," OK but Boring
","OK start your dislikes folks but these are my views of the film and I'm sticking to them. Of course I despised 'Batman Vs. Superman' probably one of the worst movies from Warner Bros. and DC comics. I hate the effects, I hate the characters and the story. All of that was to hype up this movie and what can I say about this one? I think it was OK but it was boring in some places! <br/><br/>There was not enough action, the story was dull and uninteresting, the introductions of The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman were weak, the villain is just unmemorable and dull and the there was so much overuse of slow motion during scenes with The Flash!<br/><br/>When some of the actions was happening there were at times some excitement with the music and build up but after that it was all talk, talk, talk that really felt like a chore to watch. I know it was all build up but maybe we could've had the time to know more about The Flash or Cyborg maybe more about how they got their power, what were lives like before their super heroic abilities? Rather than doing that for a stand alone film. You know character development.<br/><br/>There introductions were weak and thin, we know hardly about them. I think Aquaman was the weakest out of all the new characters. All I see in him is a bit like a douche bag and that's it. Sure everyone might say its a comic book movie for the fans of DC but I'm not a huge comic book fan but I enjoy seeing these types of movies. But for an average movie goer they would have no idea who these characters are and what they were like. It would've been better if DC and WB release the stand alone films first and then the big crossover movies. Marvel does that better. Marvel showcases the characters first so we can get to know them and their story and their super power. DC seems like they're taking shortcuts.<br/><br/>The villain, oh god I think he was dull. He's your typical super villain that wants to destroy the world and that's it and despite that I do love animation, the CGI render of him makes him look more like something out of Playstation 1 game heck some scenes are its out from PS cutscene. The CG in this movie is good at times but it was overdone in the film. I think Cyborg looks so fake as his head was swaying from side to side when he walks while his body was in place. <br/><br/>I hate the overuse of the slow motion when it comes The Flash's scenes. While I was watching the movie I kept rolling my eyes and groaning to myself inwardly at those scenes. It feels like it was dragging itself to meet the movie's time frame. Maybe it could've been better if you just showed the Flash doing things in real time? They did that earlier in the movie when he was visiting his father in jail. I know it's suppose to be those moments where it was his perspective but give it a break, we get it! He runs so fast!<br/><br/>There were some good stuff. There was some good laughs such as after Superman threw Batman to the ground after he was resurrected and said 'Do you bleed?' Batman was actually hurt and bleeding and it gave me the little chuckle. The little banter between the heroes was a chuckle too. I think there was some good acting particularly from the guy who plays as Cyborg I think he was good with the serious talk and Gal Gadot was great as usual as Wonder Woman, which I have to say her stand alone movie was the best thing coming from WB and DC! There was character development, her strong powerful personality really shines with her sense of leadership and caring for people. She discovers the outside of her Island and learns how to blend in without being stupid! All of that that lead to this movie is something that WB and DC should try and do if they ever thought of rebooting this universe. <br/><br/>But in the end, the movie was OK but dull and boring in the end. I was hoping this would be good after seeing 'Wonder Woman' but sadly it didn't."
"qwei-ba","10","2","5","20 November 2017"," I like this film vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvery much!
","The two post-credits scenes are great, and the actions are very exciting. The film makes Aquaman like a funny guy with a little rock style(or Vikings?). The Flash is a highlight flash who makes me interested. Cyborg's 'Booyah' is really cute. What about Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman? Well, you'll just have to see them by yourself, and I'm sure that you won't be disappointed!"
"tdevil9","4","2","5","19 November 2017"," A mindless film. Good action but that's it.
","I had high hopes for Justice League. From BvS I would have thought that the scriptwriters had enough feedback to come up with a tighter script that would avoid the mistakes made in its predecessor. Sadly, they didn't. The only two highlights for me were: 1. Seeing the Justice League altogether in one film, albeit incomplete.<br/><br/>2. Seeing the right (badass) version of Deathstroke, instead of the lame Will Smith version. I hope they completely ignore the ""Suicide Squad"" when making the next films cos it was rubbish. What is confusing is that the same Batman and Flash are in ""Suicide Squad"".<br/><br/>And this is my first complaint. In one flashback scene we get to see a Green Lantern fighting Steppenwolf during his first invasion. So why is Green Lantern missing from the current day threat? He is meant to be the protector of Earth so it just does not make sense why he is missing.<br/><br/>Here are my other complaints: Where the hell was Darkseid. After all the hype, he is nowhere to be seen. Nor is there any hint of him being in the next film.<br/><br/>The pacing was off. Some parts of the film were too slow, whilst some crucial scenes were rushed. The prime example was the scene where Superman is revived.<br/><br/>What was the point of the family? They served no purpose whatsoever.<br/><br/>Flash was written as the butt of the film's jokes. I didn't think he deserved that, but they are basically trying too hard to copy Marvel's light-hearted tone. Even Superman makes some cracks in this movie. The script writers are trying too hard to be what it is not.<br/><br/>Steppenwolf defeated the Amazonians and Atlantians way way too easily. You would think that after his first defeat, the races would have passed down their knowledge on how he was defeated the first time, to prevent him from succeeding the second time. And why were there only 3-4 Atlantians guarding the cube.<br/><br/>The whole cubes thing was so obviously a ripoff of the Tesseract cube.<br/><br/>Where were the Amazons and the Atlantians? Why weren't they helping our heroes? Why was Martha Kent forced to sell her farm? If she could not keep up the mortgage payments (which is what the script implied), then surely Bruce Wayne would have rescued her (especially since she has the same name as his own Mother...).<br/><br/>Why was Martha Kent's reaction one of joy when seeing Superman alive again. WOuldn't it be one of sadness and anger that her son was not left to rest in peace?? How was Alfred able to bring Lois Lane so quickly to the scene of destruction to stop Superman? If they were ""around the corner"", then surely Lois Lane would've known what they were planning and would have insisted on being there to meet Superman instead of staying hidden as the ""big gun"".<br/><br/>Steppenwolf was kicking Wonder Woman and Aquaman's asses. And yet, Superman came and beat the crap out of him like he was nothing. Again, there was no credibility in the script.<br/><br/>How is it that the first two cubes activated exactly when a major character came to look at it? (Queen Hippolyta and Aquaman, respectively).<br/><br/>After the Doomsday incident, why is the resuscitation chamber still existing? Surely, the US government would've ordered it to be dismantled and scrapped?? Did they really want to risk another Doomsday being created? Many of you will disagree with me on this but Gal Gadot is not Wonder Woman. Bring on Megan Fox!! Any fan of the animated feature movies will agree on this. Gal Gadot should at least hire a voice coach."
"Kingslaay","Null","2","5","18 November 2017"," Another let down
","Justice League was definitely better than BvS but the bar was never that high. The film was a slightly better, less dark and lighter film. You could tell they were trying to pull of the humor that Marvel did effortlessly. The acting was decent but it was woven together by a weak story and villain. Except for sharing a name with a great rock band, the villain failed to impress and create a sense of danger. The plot was the standard I want to destroy earth and raise my kingdom and the heroes need to band together again. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck seemed uninterested in this film and didn't have as much of a presence as I would have liked. Wonder Woman as always worked like a charm and captured everyone's attention. The flash actually worked and the jokes were not that bad. Cyborg and Aquaman were a disappointment. While they looked the part, they failed too impress. Another big flaw in this film was the importance and hype the overpowered Superman was given. While I don't mind Superman as a hero but he has too many powers and it is only some ridiculous alien monster with no personality that presents a challenge. When he finally returned in the last and lackluster fighting scene he was more formidable than his opponent and easily fought off the villain. Where was the intensity and challenge if this overpowered hero easily beats down the villain. It's obvious Snyder has a crush on Superman.<br/><br/>Sadly there was a lot of potential but it was wasted in a movie that will likely be forgotten in a year. Zac Snyder should be prevented and blocked from making superhero movies. He has ruined and stopped the DC universe from taking off except for Wonder Woman. <br/><br/>6.8/10"
"paddy-56","8","2","5","18 November 2017"," Better than expected
","I'm one of those few that really liked Man of Steel and Batman vs. Superman, Dawn of Justice (Director's Cut). I loved Wonder Woman and thought Suicide Squad was a crazy mess. I did like Jared Leto's Joker. Based on the internet reviews I was cautiously optimistic that Justice League was okay. It was more than okay. Very entertaining with a lot of genuine humour and great chemistry between the characters and a few really tear jerking moments. <br/><br/>What I liked. Great characters. Adults with adult dialogue, understated and outright hilarious moments. That's a big change from former DC movies, and a welcome change. There were suggestions of backstories to some characters that have me looking forward to stand alone movies. Great special effects, except for one thing...mentioned in the What I didn't Like section below. I thought the battles were clearly constructed and the casting is uniformly excellent. Story wasn't too complicated, big bad threat and the team comes together to fight big bad. Standard super hero fair, and not too complex for this introduction to the League.<br/><br/>What I didn't like. The CGI for the Big Bad. The excellence of the other special effects made Big Bad look even worse. The Minions (Para Demons) were very good, much better than Big Bad. Warner Bros..... You had a great character actor voicing this Demon. You need a REAL actor in the role. Action capture technology or the actor in full costume and enlarged as in Lord of the Rings. Never felt he was a threat, just a cardboard excuse for the Big Bad. Only blatantly bad aspect of this movie, but glaring in it's poor quality. If you bring him back or have Darkseid in a later film, do the RIGHT thing and have a quality actor. You had excellent actors in every other role so this bungle is a real puzzle."

","Being a DC and MARVEL film fan , I can honestly say that all the negative critics and comments should be ignored and you should give this film a chance. I don't know about everyone else's opinion but I personally feel that not every film in the comic book genre should be like a marvel film for it to be perceived as a great movie. Marvel films are great and successful (not all of them but most) but I personally feel that DC have that rougher edge in their characters and by the end of most DC movies (man of steel, batman v superman, Wonder Woman and justice league ) your left with that feeling which keeps you thirsty for more, and a sense of satisfaction after a long wait , the main difference I felt with DC and marvel is that Marvel films are very comical and after you watch those movies you know it's ""just a movie"" kind of feeling where as with DC you actually sit back and think like ""what if that actually existed or happens one day "" a sense of more realism and I love that, can I also add I love the way Zack Snyder brings his vision in such an epic way, his ability to project these characters and his vision on the whole with this movie is just awesome. I for one believe that we are all in a great time to be watching and experiencing these movies, be it DC or MARVEL, the amount of effort and time spent on these movies is phenomenal to say the least so I don't know why these critics are acting like it's some rubbish movie and it's a crime against cinema or that it deserves a low rating!! I can only say that these critics are most likely coming from an angle where they are comparing it to marvel and expect it to be like marvel movies , but I Strongly disagree with this approach because yes this movie does have a few slight flaws but that's only because of a cgi glitch I noticed on one of the characters but the second time around I just ignored it and enjoyed the film even more !! Go watch the film and enjoy it, appreciate the music in the background, the fact that your witnessing these characters team up and come alive on the big screen, it's something different and new, !! The action , and visuals are brilliant, overall a brilliant movie !!"
"shapnikshawon","8","2","5","18 November 2017"," A good foundation movie for future DC movies
","If you think it will be as bad as BVS, then I think you are in for surprise! I think it was a good movie to watch. The actions were on point. The characters were really great. I haven't seen a lot of superhero movies with such amazing actions.<br/><br/>I would have liked if the movie were little longer. It could fill in the audience and make the final action more intense. The introduction of Superman was epic. But we deserved more screen time from the Man of Steel.<br/><br/>For Batman, I think we have the best live action Batman ever. I hated when they chose Affleck to play the role. But my god, he is the most bad-ass portrayal of the Gotham Knight. We got to see more of Bruce Wayne than Batman. I would really love to watch solo Batman movie with Affleck in it. He is great!<br/><br/>Wonder woman was on point. And Ezra Miller proved me wrong. He was the surprise pack. Aquaman was a beast. Cyborg I think was the okay among all of these superheroes. <br/><br/>To talk about the negative sides, I think all the side roles had very minimum time screen which limited their contribution. I am a huge fan of Alfred and Commissioner Gordon. WB could easily afford them more screen time. <br/><br/>If the standard of superhero movies is that they will do serious works while being funny all the time, then of course, it isn't funny with too many one liners which really works for Marvel movies these days. That doesn't mean that every other studios have to follow it. Every movie should be judged on how they handle their situation. For me, JL did it. Of course, it is not the best superhero movie. But it certainly did the groundwork for the next DC movies. All the characters are great. <br/><br/>I think the reviews on JL and critic rating is bit harsh. It was a great movie. Way to go DC!"
"cotita-1","8","2","5","18 November 2017"," Better than I expected.
","After all the problems with the director swap and re-shoots I was expecting a pretty mediocre film, but I'm pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I don't think the Wonder Woman film is a good as critics say but never the less, Gal Gadot is great in both films. She carries the weight of the movie for the most part, but also shares it with Ben Affleck. Both take turns in being the leader in the film.<br/><br/>Flash is a welcome comic relief, very much like he is in the animated series, but not on the TV series. Its a different take which I actually like better. (And I'm a big fan of the Flash TV series)<br/><br/>Cyborg was also a nice surprise. They cleaned up the CGI so it doesn't look as fake as it did on the trailer. I think he should have a little bit more of a back story, buy then again the movie would have been much longer.<br/><br/>Superman is played exactly in the way I expected. He seems even stronger than when he fought doomsday. Its like he could have taken over Steppenwolf by himself, no problem. But there's more than just fighting the bad guy.<br/><br/>Steppenwolf is the weakest point here, bad CGI, bad lipsync, and he just doesn't look that menacing even though he can single handedly beat almost all of the JL.<br/><br/>As its pretty much given nowadays, the trailer shows several scenes that didn't make the cut. There's one that created several fan theories. Well that's not in the final film and it becomes clear why its left out.<br/><br/>There are a couple of post credit scenes. The last one sets the path for the next film, but I'm not really sure if its for the next batman or JL2. From looking at it, I wouldn't be surprised is there is a JL3."

The evolution of Cyborg and Aquaman remains to be seen.<br/><br/>I like the overall aesthetics of the film, hopefully the changes they introduce for the future are to get the film to reach 100%."
"scientistsoumyaneel","8","2","5","18 November 2017"," Disappointment
","Major Spoiler Warning: The movie was a disappointment. Even though the entry of the characters, especially Batman, Wonder Woman and SteppenWolf were great and cool, the others did not get such flashy introduction. I personally liked the fact that the scenes quickly changed, like we were getting a quick intro. But most of the scenes were cut and rushed and this had a devastating effect on the film. Superhero movies have two main elements: action and scores. The actions were slow, inconsistent, pathetically choreographed and very very brief. The actions of BvS were far superior than this. The scores were extremely bad, even worse than Suicide Squad. To make things worse, the villain's powers was very very unclear. All he did was swing his axe...and nothing. Sometimes he was seen taking over other superheroes, sometimes he was beaten by a single punch. And he got beaten just by a single punch by Superman and by getting his axe destroyed...WTF?! SteppenWolf, as a villain, doesn't stand a chance in front of DoomsDay. I don't have any complaints about CGI or the plot, since it is a common feature of a superhero film. I personally found the CGI better than Thor Ragnarok and the plot fancy. I also liked the colour scheme of the film, initially dark, then light when Superman arrives, and then, during the fight with SteppenWolf (though there was not much of a fight), red. I found Aquaman kinda annoying; Flash was good but was portrayed too slow. He is a lot faster than is shown in the film. Cyborg was good and had a lot of potential for development. The biggest problem with the movie, I would agree with other critics, was the fact that such a long movie was edited so much and fitted into a 2 hour time-frame, which is ridiculously short for a movie having so many characters. Many of its major scenes and dialogues was deleted, which was again a downer. Another disappointment was the acting. Everyone, in my opinion, was a B-grade actor. Overall, the film, although enjoyable, had a lot of flaws, was an utter disappointment, was extremely rushed, and had very brief action scenes which was the biggest downer for me."
"sharilshahed","8","2","5","18 November 2017"," A criminally panned movie just because it isn't a masterpiece
","If you wanna go in expecting CGI in the level of Planet of the Apes Reboots or Avatar, storytelling with the depth of One who flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Shawshank Redemption or Fight Club, action as practical and scenery chewing as Mad Max, Star Wars, or even the good Marvel films, villains as compelling as Joker from the Dark Knight, then I daresay this is not a movie you'd enjoy. Considering it's frustratingly downgrading ratings, I say many people had high expectations from this.<br/><br/>On the opposite, it definitely as flaws about the points I've mentioned above. CGI is sub-par, no doubt. I'll admit I had some issues during the flashback scene and Flash's use of his flashy powers (pardon my puns). But not so intolerable as some are weeping about. Even after hearing the comment on Superman, I was like ""So wait? Henry Cavill had a mustache all these time?"" The story is straightforward and simple, gather the superheroes, beat the bad guy, save the world. It or any other plot elements are nowhere as confusing or convoluted as BvS to be naturally considered bad. Exact case for the villain, Steppenwolf, who seemed nothing more than an elite brutish thug and herald for upcoming bigger threats, imagine Suicide Squad's Incubus (remember him? me neither, at least not the name for which I had to google) being the major threat instead of Enchantress. So is he good? No. Forgettable? Likely. But still better by a few margins than BvS' Lex Luthor, or Suicide Squad's Joker and Enchantress. Actions, as I mentioned earlier, enjoyed them and didn't saw any considerable flaws.<br/><br/>Enough justifying the faults, on the pro-side, the eponymous Justice League characters are energetic and enjoyable, so much that it's easy to forgot how stupid it felt that the Flash is basically Barry in Wally's name and personality, also that cringe outfit. His naivete, alongside the memetic Aquamomoa, a more optimistic Batman, the adorable Wonderwoman, and Cyborg (whose placement and roles didn't feel too less executed) all gave strong performances. There's jokes and one liners but they're not overflowing like the current Marvel films, for those that hate these. It also barely even felt rushed as a movie that had 1/3rd of it's runtime cut down, by that, expect it's full release (aka extended cut -_-) to be even more better.<br/><br/>So yes the movie can be enjoyable if you're not an overly critical moviegoer and definitely so if you're a comic book fan, since there are a lot of easter eggs and reference decently done."

(my personal favourite was when superman can see flash running towards him). The movie truly is great, they gave enough action time to each character. If there is 1 minor criticism is that stepanwolf seemed a bit weak and there was nothing about Darksaid in the movie. The film had been restricted to 2 hours by Warner Bros so it seems a lot has been cut out. I truly can't wait to see the directors cut and future sequels."
"callumpenzer-79938","7","2","5","18 November 2017"," This is the beginning of the DCEU
","This film has been my number 1 priority to watch this year after the trailer dropped in Summer 2016. I had really high expectations in the upcoming months which changed closer to the release yesterday where I changed my opinion and thought it is gonna be way worse that I hoped. This did however come to a shock when the 2 hour length film gave me high hopes for the future of the DCEU. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't perfect, but if they had more time they could have achieved this. There were a mix of pros and cons which I personally think the pros outweigh the cons due to me being a big DC fan.<br/><br/>Pros:- (SPOILERS) 1. Batfleck is proving to be the best and carries the most resemblance to an older version of Batman. 2. Wonder Woman has a great dynamic with the other characters and fits with how the story pans out. 3. Cyborg has a dark and depressed side to him because of his new powers but it's an interesting way of portraying the character. 4. Aquaman shall never be known as the useless one in the Justice League ever again thanks to Jason Momoa doing an amazing 'surfer dude' like portrayal. 5. Ezra Miller's Flash has a promising future in the DCEU due to his comedic quality and performance. 6. Cyborg says his famous phrase 'Booya!' 7. The action scenes are continuous fun and are hilarious. 8. There can easily be a future friendship between Flash and Cyborg. 9. Superman's return was played out incredibly. 10. Thepost-credit scene has the biggest reveal and will leave you on the edge of your seat with the villain reveal. 11. The flashback scene with the war against Steppenwolf confirms the that Green Lanterns exist in the DCEU. 12. Batman was not useless which most people thought he would be.<br/><br/>Cons:- (SPOILERS) 1. Steppenwolf is a basic and easily forgettable villain. 2. Steppenwolf also seems to lose half of his ability to fight in the end fight scene. 3. Superman's CGI beard is awful and once you notice it, it's very obvious. 4. The plot seemed a bit messy due to the two directors (which you can see clearly). 5. The film seemed like it was two 1 hour episodes of a TV series, directed by two different directors. 6. The film was rushed due to their limited time frame of 2 hours. 7. Only 6 members of the Justice League were used out of 7 (I wanted to see Green Lantern introduced).<br/><br/>Overall, I believe that this is a strong start to the DECU and if Zack Snyder didn't have to face unfortunate family events, it may have been even better. I am looking forward to what the future of the DCEU holds and how it is going to handle solo films to further character development and how they are going to handle the Justice League sequel. I would recommend this film to family's and die hard DC fans any day due to the immense creativity and crisis that was dealt within this film."

","A DC nerd-fest with lot of entertainment value, a longer run-time would have benefited the whole movie though. 3rd act was OK compared to the first two! Superman mustache removal CGI(on his upper lip) was jarring but fortunately won't take you out of the movie. Lighter tone and humour are a welcome edition although at some parts the humour was disrespectful to the characters mythos, I still prefer the tone set by Wonder Woman where the use of bathos was kept to a minimum and the serious moments still had weight and some sort of payoff to them while also having some lighter moment sprinkled throughout the movie. Sit throughout the END CREDITS you don't want to miss it!!! The movie should have been delayed by a month or two to perfect the CGI and to perfect the script a tad bit more although Zack and Joss did a great job given the ridiculous mandate they had to work with which forced them to release the movie (introducing three new characters) spanning less than two hours!"

He's got a lot of action, he's got his touches of humor, characters that make up a group with a lot of chemistry, and everyone they have their function within a very diverse group. The villain is to match the group he faces, and he's got quite a charisma. In short, it's very entertaining. I'm glad I paid for entrance."

","I wonder what the critics were smoking, Justice League is highly entertaining. It's much sunnier than its forerunners, a definitive foot print of Joss Whedon. There had been some slight pacing issue which must have been due to keeping the time line within two hours, however it was not at all distracting. The league itself was remarkable with extreme action, one of the best in the DCEU franchise. It makes me really appreciate Zack's ultimate vision which he contributed to this fascinating story arc."
"iscrizionimarco","9","2","5","18 November 2017"," DC Comics is coming
","I have awaited for this movie since the first time I have heard about it. I've loved Dawn of Justice even if Man of Steel has been better. Comparing this movie with the ""Avengers"" is rather than normal and Justice League comes out very well from this ""battle"". All of us, as fan, we know that most of characters have been portrayed again with an own movie (not Batman but I mean I'm OK with this since it has happen also for Hulk). On the other hand, presenting in one shot Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg is not easy. Zack Snyder has done really a good job but I would say that the first part could be better: characters are not analyzed in details. In general movie gives 10 minutes each one in order to go through their story. Beside this, movie is focused on saving Earth from Armageddon (yes, always same story) and team work is really good. They are exactly what we expect: a team of heroes that must understand how to work together. It will be not easy, it will be not simple but they will understand. Let's try to analyze movie by hero: * Batman -> He is leader of this team because he has recruited all these guys. He does not want to have this role but he has to because Superman has dead and Wonder Woman still complains about Steve Trevor's death. He feels guilty because of Superman's death. * Wonder Woman -> I have to admit she is gorgeous and also more. She will accept at the end to be a leader. * Aquaman -> He's a son of .... :-) * Flash-> Flash is the clown. He's a guy too much younger than the others. Batman as leader gives him a scope, a mission that accepts and understands. * Cyborg -> He is the real dark part of the story. Created from ""one of the engine"" he has a great connection with the whole story. He will have a great part in the movie maybe more than Aquaman. * Superman -> Who has seen the trailers knows that Superman will be part of this movie so this is not a real spoiler. I like Superman and I like Henry Cavill. With him this team is kind of unstoppable.<br/><br/>In conclusion my vote is 9 because I would like to give DC comics all my support but it is not 10 since I'd prefer a much more darker story. You are saving the world from kind of an alien invasion so let's be serious."
"reeves2002","9","2","5","17 November 2017"," It delivered and was better than expected
","I really had a fun time watching this film and enjoyed it more then Thor Ragnarok which I saw the night before. It was a fun straight forward action film and even though it had 2 directors it mashed together OK. I am surprised by the low rating and urge people don't listen to so called critics ESPECIALLY rotten tomatoes. It started out slow but pace was good. The movie could have used 20 more minutes of just backstory footage of Cyborg, the Flash and Aquaman, all the others had their solo films. I enjoyed Ben Affleck as Batman again and Wonder Woman shines once more in this film. I am happy Superman figured in it somewhat early on and not just in a climatic ending scene. He's my favorite character and even though his reappearance wasn't what i was expecting it was satisfying. The score was good and I do agree with some of the criticism of this cut and hope Snyder's cut or an extended one of this one is released since so many of the best scenes in the trailers were left out. Also I wanna know if a black suit superman with long hair and beard was shot and just cut out because of re shoots since there were so many hints of it even Henry Cavill teased there would be so hoping it wasn't just a red-herring. Ray Fisher gave a really good performance but trailers showed clips i was expecting to see. I hope he gets a solo film i want to see him before becoming Cyborg. Ezra Miller was good as the Flash except for some minor dialogue where it sort of disrespects the character of Barry Allen. Jason Momoa isn't my favorite actor and i found him the most miscast mainly because he isn't the quintessential Aquaman with the blonde hair. The blonde hair is iconic and a few streaks in his dark hair do nothing and Marvel did it better with Thor. It was nice briefly seeing the supporting cast return i really Like Diane Lane and liked J.K. Simmons as commissioner Gordon. Oddly Perry White was absent and I was expecting to see Willem Dafoe. Critics said the CGI was bad with Cavill but I never noticed it in the first viewing and if it wasn't pointed out so much i probably wouldn't have. True Steppenwolf could have been a bit more vicious and didn't meet expectations of many but he got the job done and i didn't find him as weak as they were saying i mean you wanna talk about weak villains the MCU has some of the weakest Disney style ones that i've ever seen, but i don't follow all the comic book stuff. Justice League was a very fun movie i loved it! I want to see it again in IMAX next and am giving a 9 out of 10 only because of the edits (extended vers. will be better) & over use of comedy. Superman's return was my favorite part of the movie and most anticipated and did not disappoint he owned this movie!"
"shahnoorpersonal","8","2","5","17 November 2017"," Honest Review
","The movie was a good movie, I wouldn't say great as it had it's flaws but I will keep it simple. As a DC and Marvel fan, I enjoy both while seeing the good and bad in both. I feel like every review is trying too hard to convince you this was perfect or that it was utter trash, it is neither.<br/><br/>Con's first,<br/><br/>-The villain could've been more but to be honest, this is the problem the majority of comic book movies have so it didn't make a huge difference for me<br/><br/>-Feel like a lot of important pieces were left on the cutting floor to meet the silly 2 hour restriction<br/><br/>-CGI could've been flushed out a little more, it wasn't as horrendous as people are making it out but it wasn't perfect for sure<br/><br/>-The story could've had a lot more weight considering this is a world ending type of invasion<br/><br/>Pro's now<br/><br/>-This is the justice league, every character has their moment to shine and leaves you wanting to see more of them. There is some good development on all the characters and the dynamics between the members were great.<br/><br/>-There was some comedic humor in the movie, not too much that it felt like a Marvel movie but enough to give you a good giggle here and there.<br/><br/>-The action sequences were probably the highlight of the movie, visually rewarding and entertaining (expected from a Snyder movie)<br/><br/>-End Credit scenes were brilliant, 2 different tones but definitely gives hope for the direction the DCEU is heading<br/><br/>-A lighter tone while retaining a shade of DC, keeps the personality without becoming too light or too dark. Was good to see more daytime sequences and a better overall tone.<br/><br/>-Flowed smoother than previous DC instances, it was a little on the faster side but didn't disrupt the flow. Previous outings it felt like you were playing catch up the whole movie... this one definitely flowed better.<br/><br/>-Soundtrack was good, not great... we still haven't hit anything along the lines of John William's score type of level. Nothing too memorable but nothing which was painful either... it was good.<br/><br/>Overall - The movie is a step in the right direction for DC, there will be those who hate with a agenda or overreact because of a single point. Truth is these are super hero movies, most of them are flawed but the key point is whether it is entertaining... this was entertaining, visually rewarding and gives hope where previously there wasn't. I would recommend you watch it yourself, if you are expecting perfect... no super hero movie really is but if you expect a super hero movie, then it is definitely one of the better products from both studios, not the best but definitely on the better side."

","This movie is a blast, everything is exiting and fun. There wasn't one scene that I didn't like. The characters are so enjoyable and the action was truly amazing. This movie was everything I wanted and more. People had issues with the villain in this movie and I have to agree with them. But who cares about the villain, it didn't hurt the movie that he was one dimensional. You don't go into a Justice League film wanting a first class villain. You go into a Justice League movie wanting to see our heroes interact and fight. Oh my gosh it is so hard not to spoil this movie because it was so good. I think that DC made a good call when making this film because I didn't see any disappointing faces walking out of that theater. This movie isn't first class like the Dark Knight, but it's a whole lot of fun. They finally did it guys, JUSTICE LEAGUE HAS FINALLY BECOME A MOVIE............ yay! My childhood is complete."

"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","2","5","16 November 2017"," Couldn't the Justice League battle the band responsible for 'Magic Carpet Ride' instead?...
","The film begins with something Superman obviously filmed before his apparent demise in BvS, then it cut to black, which elicited an ""Um...okay?"" reaction from my audience. We're next treated to Batfleck vs. insect-man (called a 'Parademon'), which got a ""WTF?"" reaction. The third reintroduction of a character we'd come to know was Diana's/Wonder Woman's, which was easily the best, as she saved a bunch of people, displayed how effective her bracelets are against machine guns and made you wish you were watching Wonder Woman 2 instead.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot as Diana/Wonder Woman continues to prove she's the best part of these movies (though there'll no doubt still be her detractors refusing to accept this fact). She exudes warmth/compassion/kindness (her final scene in the movie is most ""Aww""-worthy), but also strength (and I don't just mean physically). She's everything a team leader *should* be. Diana plays well off Batfleck (even when he's being a jerk). If you're no fan of Batfleck, it's doubtful this movie will change your mind. Thankfully, the others call him out on his jerky behavior (Diana gives him a well-deserved super shove when he brings up Steve Trevor, while Barry lets Bruce know exactly where he stands in regards to him ticking off Diana/what she could do to him and how the team would be on *her* side), thus making Batfleck bearable (Jeremy Irons as Alfred tries his best to create an enjoyable dynamic with Batfleck).<br/><br/>Aquaman, Flash & Cyborg all get short introductory scenes, which leads to scenes feeling like a bit of a shambles, as we cut between them back and forth. Just as something interesting is happening with one, we cut to another. I was interested in the stuff between Jason Momoa's Arthur Curry/Aquaman and Amber Heard's Mera (who seems to kick a reasonable amount of underwater butt), but it was sadly cut short and she didn't appear again. At least Aquadude brings a different sort of personality to the team.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller's Barry Allen is much more manic than we've come to know him as in his TV iteration (though I think Grant Gustin's scenes with his onscreen father have this movie beat). He provides the majority of the 'comic relief'. He may start to bug after a while depending on your tolerance level for such characters. Some of his jokes work and some don't (much like Batfleck's attempts at humour). I think the 'humourous' moments work best with the characters you LEAST expect them from, such as Diana, Alfred and (to some extent) Arthur (there's a particularly funny moment involving him and Diana's Lasso of Truth).<br/><br/>Ray Fisher does quite well as Victor Stone/Cyborg. He's not given a lot, but makes the most of what he's got (the CGI didn't bother me). Everyone acknowledges Diana's obvious awesomeness (they'd be fools NOT to). Her ability to hold her own/lead is never called into question by the other characters (nor should it be), which is refreshing (unlike certain other superhero team-up movies). It's Diana herself who experiences some self-doubt, which she overcomes; she saves everyone's butt on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>The team all saves each other, actually. It's never a case of one person doing everything/'taking all the glory' (again, unlike with a certain other so-called superhero 'team'). They work well, and it's good to see Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg all respect Diana. Speaking of, complaints regarding 'lingering shots' of Gal Gadot being 'exploitative' have been rather overblown. There's no more 'leering camera' on her than there is on at least two of the male heroes who have their shirts off at one point or another (and what about all the male shirtlessness we're subjected to in other superhero films? How is it that's 'okay', but a 'butt shot' of a female character here or there upsets everyone?).<br/><br/>This film's unnecessarily CGI'd villain, Steppenwolf, is just another forgettable comic book movie villain (so...basically the usual)). The most memorable part involving him is a game of 'Keep Away' the Amazons play with this film's McGuffin ('Mother Boxes') on horseback. I wish we could've spent more time with Diana's people, along with Aquaman's, as I would've gladly given up all the Lois/Lois & Clark scenes (as well as most of the scenes focusing on a random family in need of rescuing) in exchange for more Amazons/Atlanteans.<br/><br/>Obviously Superman eventually returns. This version of Lois & Clark continue to be the most chemistry-free comic book romantic pairing, scenes between them kill any momentum/bring proceedings to a screeching halt, and watching them trying to be 'cute'/'funny' is painful (they waste time talking in a cornfield when he's most needed to help the team and Diana's forced to do the heavy lifting in his absence). Henry Cavill's Clark/Superman works much better interacting with the other heroes. It really should've been Diane Lane's Martha (instead of Lois) playing the 'important' part in calming down the freshly resurrected, not to mention dangerous to his teammates (just look at Flash's ""Oh, crap!"" face in reaction to Superman super-glaring at him), Zombie Clark...especially considering how important Martha was in BvS. Also, I would've preferred anybody but Lois providing the movie's end voice-over.<br/><br/>If you dislike battles filled with CGI, then...sucks for you, as there's plenty on display and not all of it works, but there are some decent action sequences, and it's interesting seeing everyone's abilities/fighting styles on display. The score uses some old themes (I missed John Williams' 'Superman Theme', which MoS sadly lacked, but I caught Danny Elfman's 'Batman Theme') as well as the always awesome/welcome 'Wonder Woman Theme'. The ending feels a bit abrupt in a ""That's it?"" sorta way, and there are two credits scenes (the mid-credits one reminded me of similar scenes in Smallville and Supergirl, involving two superheroes racing. If you don't like Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor, there's no reason to wait until the end). The Justice League has united/'come together'...so, now what? Answer: Bring on Wonder Woman 2! What? We have to wait until 2020?!"

","Everyone involved in making ""Justice League,"" and everyone who will eventually see it, deserved something better than this. This movie is a pointless and expensive CGI that even Gadot's Wonder Woman luminescent star power, can rescue. Given the generic state of the plot and how uninteresting the characters are, ""Justice League"" wasn't worth the trouble. For me this movie is the most mediocre, boring and pointless A-list superhero film going back through the nearly 40 years of modern superhero films.

","I am a massive DC fanboy, and I haven't missed a film based on a DC character since 1997. I would stand in line with my hard earned cash on their opening day. Ironically, the first film I had the honor to see as a young lad was Batman and Robin, by Joel Schumacher. Many of you would feel pity, but compared to this, it is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>When Batman v Superman was released, my lifelong love affair with the Batman character came to an abrupt end. That film was lackluster at best, which is a shame as the actors was really good in their roles.<br/><br/>One would think that such a poor performance critically would have been met with a severance package for either Zack, or Chris, preferably both. Instead, they were awarded with a larger budget.<br/><br/>True to form, the film was plagued with development issues. It was supposed to have been released earlier, but the original cut was deemed ""unwatchable"" by test audiences, resulting in re-shoots with a new director, Joss Whedon. The Zack faithful swear that this was the downfall of the film, spoiler alert, it was not.<br/><br/>Snyder has a tendency to over-rely on CGI, with smaller productions, this is not problematic, but on large scale, it is very noticeable. The CGI looks like a late naughties PlayStation game. Cyborg's CGI is unconvincing, which is a shame as the actor portraying him does a very good job. The complete third act looks amateurish, and ugly. The film might have had a better chance if the production team had relied on practical effects instead of CGI.<br/><br/>The story is almost non-existent, there is never the feeling of real urgency. Steppenwolf is at best, a C-grade villain, the majority of the viewing public would've never encountered this character before, and why should they? The reason for this thin story line is the splitting of a single story that would've worked well as a film into two boring films. It has never worked, and has always left me feeling cheated.<br/><br/>If I hadn't seen the previous mess, I might have given Chris Terrio the benefit of the doubt. He is by no stretch a bad writer, but he is definitely not suited for this genre.<br/><br/>The actors is the best part of this film. They were clearly recruited by a very good casting director.<br/><br/>As a DC fanboy, I am disgusted, and repulsed by this film. I don't want to see another incoherent extended cut, and I sincerely hope that we will vote with our wallets, and bury this franchise. It is a revoltingly bad story-line with bad visuals (because of a director that hasn't worked without it since his second feature). Steer clear, there isn't a better cut, let's bury this, and forget it happened."

","Pros:
1. As usual with Zack Snyder (Director) films, there are some really impressive, and eye-catching, visuals.<br/><br/>Cons:
1. There are a couple plot-holes. For example, Wonder Woman's (Gal Gadot) whip induces people to tell the truth. However, when she ensnares a henchman in it, he somehow avoids telling the truth by answering a question she didn't ask.
2. The acting is pretty terrible for the most part, but especially from Gal Gadot and Ben Affleck (Batman/ Bruce Wayne).
3. The special effects look absolutely awful, with stand-outs being Henry Cavill's (Superman/ Clark Kent) missing mustache, and Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds) himself.
4. The action scenes all just devolve into CGI schlock-fests that are wholly unengaging and boring to watch.
5. The humour falls extraordinarily flat, particularly with the character of The Flash/ Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) whose main role seems to be supplying annoying and inappropriate one-liners and jokes.
6. Steppenwolf has no motivation for his actions other than conquering. This makes his character bland and uninteresting.
7. The score is way too cheesy and overbearing at times.
8. The dialogue is incredibly clunky and mostly serves to force-feed the audience exposition.
9. It's obvious that the outside locations are all clearly filmed on a Hollywood studio set, and it's made even more blatant by the ugly artificial lighting."

","It is really fortunate to be able to see the film in the cinema before the world premiere. Almost 14 years are what I expected to see a ""Live Action"" of the Justice League, and the film is really amazing, and deserves to be seen in the movies, so let's start with the good of the movie.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are very well achieved, to the point of forgetting that there is some choreography already written.<br/><br/>The interaction between the members of the league is fantastic, we can see  a group of superheroes with a goal, but with internal frictions and without a fixed leader.<br/><br/>In terms of image, the same thing has been repeated of the previous films of the DCEU, that is, it is still spectacular, true artistic scenes whether with or without CGI. Snyder's hand is still intact.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is nothing of the ""other world"", but it is good, in addition to listen to the classic themes of Batman and Superman is insurmountable.<br/><br/>The movie does not have the 10 stars for very minimal things.<br/><br/>The first is the sound mix, often the music is lost among so much noise. The second, is the villain, who fails to stand out, but still opens the door to a more powerful villain, more feared, but known among fans. The third and last is the duration, 121 minutes are nothing, compared to the previous films of the DCEU, which will leave us pending the Extended Version.<br/><br/>Justice League is undoubtedly a good movie of superheroes, far surpassing those of the ""competition"". DC has a lot more to show and we are eager to see it.<br/><br/>PS: there are 2 scenes post credits and they are totally worth it."

"fntstcplnt","2","2","6","12 July 2019"," Justice League (2017)
","Directed by Zack Snyder & Joss Whedon. Starring Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher, Henry Cavill, Jeremy Irons, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, J.K. Simmons, Ciarán Hinds, Joe Morton. (PG-13)<br/><br/>Turgid time-waster aims to do for DC what the Avengers did for Marvel, but while Marvel's all-star smackdown was less a home run than a solid base hit to left, Justice League is simply a strikeout where the batter's pants fall down after missing the swing. While struggling to cram several new superheroes (as well as one of the most generic and forgettable villains to ever appear in a major comic book film) into a movie that runs less than two hours, the story is so rushed and fragmented that it often makes little sense, and it's a chore to even pretend to care about the film's raison d'être MacGuffin (boxes of power, or some such nonsense, a concept already done to death by Marvel, Transformers, and so on). Miller manages a few chuckles as the Flash, but his character rides name recognition only, and his hero-in-action sequences are just a rehash of Quicksilver's twaddle in the X-Men movies. Meanwhile, Affleck broods and grumbles halfheartedly, Gadot poses more than acts, Cavill cashes his paycheck, Momoa plays a gym rat version of the Little Merman, and so on. Even as a sensory-assaulting stew of eye candy, it fails to deliver excitement; it wouldn't have helped if the action had been directed/edited with more than the scintilla of skill on display here since the special effects are an ugly, cartoonish swamp. Much has been made of Cavill's rubbery alien mouth, but even more annoying is how literally half the film looks like cut scenes from a PS3 title. I wouldn't want to play such an uninspired mess of a video game; watching one on the sidelines is even more of a chore.<br/><br/>22/100"

","Alien 4 had previously held the record for ""worst movie of all time"" in my opinion but was beaten by the inconceivably bad trainwreck that is Justice League. I am at a loss for words about this movie. I felt like I was watching a Marvel movie with a high fever and an overdose of cocaine. Nothin made sense, the script is so awful Joss Whedon should have been fired before filming even started and all the characters are antisympathetic to the point where I even considered turning off. The antagonist, Steppenwolf, is so badly conceived and laughingly executed, the enttie movie so videogame-esque that most of the times it felt more like a bad videogame with some actors appearing than a film supported by visual effects. The entire look of the movie was changed from the cool and dark appearance of Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman, both of which I liked very much to accomodate an artistically inept audience and does give the film a comic-like appearance which I absolutely despise. Even the soundtrack is both boring and massively stupid. There is absolutely nothing I liked about this film which is staggering to me even more so since I very much liked the DC movies up until this point. I sincerely hope that the series doesn't go down further this path or I'm gonna have to refuse to watch this moronic crap in the future..."

If you want an original movie, watch Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children or Amadeus.<br/><br/>Bottom line, it's close to impossible to see a fully original movie nowadays.<br/><br/>And yes, I'm more into Marvel stories.

","I really liked this and was better than I was expecting.<br/><br/>The villain was good, very powerful, but thought Superman dealt with him a bit to easy considering how he was man handling the other heroes!<br/><br/>The actors were good, really liked Aquaman, was not sure at first from trailers, but he was good as was everyone else. Even the Flash grew on me, he was humorous, reminded me of Spider-Man a bit, but he's a teen and it was not overdone like Thor in that latest film.<br/><br/>I think Zack Snyder is getting a lot of bad stick over this, because it was not a blatant comedy like Thor, which is a shame, as I think he's done well on this one and this is how a comic film should be in my opinion, so please don't go down the marvel route of slapstick comedy throughout.<br/><br/>I was not a fan of SvB, but this has made up for that for me!<br/><br/>Good stuff, Watchmen is still my favourite comic film but I think this is definitely in my top 10 comic book films of all time!"

","I guess you have to just love DC heroes to love this film entirely. The only way I could fault it is that is wasn't long enough! I could've sat through hours and hours of that! I laughed a lot, it was emotional. It was unexpected. Even the way Superman arrived due to some scenes in the trailer being different than in the actual movie which turns out being a lot more pleasant than annoying. Amazing movie. I wasn't convinced of Ezra Miller being the Flash, but he's so different from Grant Gustin's Flash, not better or worse, just different. Funnier, actually. But here he's not the team leader so he can take the role of the joker type in the movie. <br/><br/>10/10!!!

","Although it lacks the epic feel of typical Zack Snyder's movie, but Justice League delivers. It's a fun ride with lots of moment like it's jumping out directly from comics books. Some sloppy editing and CGI didn't get in the way of great character interaction and cool action sequence. Elfman is no Zimmers but some sequence fits really well with the nostalgic theme song. Definitely a must see for DC and comics fan."

","Another entry in the DC universe with Zack Snyder at the helm directing. This met my expectations but sadly it does not get a full ten stars. My one main complaint was the pacing, it just felt odd at times and this seems to be a recurring theme with Zack Snyder films. The humor wasn't overly done but seemed to be just the right amount. The flash's actor seemed to do well. The cinematography was great and the film looked great. The CGI at times felt a little off and could've been cleaner. Overall I enjoyed the movie and look forward to more entries in the DC universe."

"pokedom","3","2","6","19 November 2017"," A little less than decent
","At this point I've set the bar low for DC films. I've raised the bar a bit from Wonder Woman and now this film, but it's still pretty low to the ground. I was hit really hard at just how bad Batman Vs Superman got, and Suicide Squad was only mediocre to compensate. Wonder Woman was better than those, but Justice League was supposed to be ""The Big One"". Like Avengers but DC. Like how Iron Man was a really good Marvel film, then four ""meh"" films later we got the one of the best Marvel movies to date. But there was no Iron Man level film for DC. So... what happened here?<br/><br/>I can applaud a few things. I think that the story of the film makes sense at the important parts and is easy enough to follow. It is a bit dumb and shaky at points, but if you pay enough attention you can piece everything together.<br/><br/>I think that it's really cool we've gotten to the point in comic book movies where we can make a Justice League film. We aren't just making a Justice League film with no buildup, we actually have a Justice League film with preceding films and films to come out after the fact.<br/><br/>Additionally, I think it's really cool that we finally have cinematic interpretations of Aquaman, The Flash, AND Cyborg. Not with any real buildup (we could have gone without Suicide Squad, which is currently unused in this cinematic universe, and instead gotten one of those three ahead of time), but at the very least we have them. Two out of those three have good casting as well, Aquaman and Cyborg.<br/><br/>Lastly, this movie can be funny at times. It can sustain a laugh or two for a bit longer than a few scenes. There's one scene where Aquaman is tied to the Lasso of Truth without actually showing he's tied to the Lasso of Truth, and that got a laugh out of me.<br/><br/>Positives are over now. Time to get mad.<br/><br/>The Flash in this movie SUCKS. If watched a few episodes of the mostly okay TV series you'll be shocked at how bad they screw him up. The casting couldn't possibly be worse. Little Grievance over here can't act at all. They abridge (I use that term in the same context as the film uses it; that is to say poorly) his backstory so much it borders on offensive. He doesn't work in S.T.A.R Labs, no, in this version he's got his own little man cave, complete with multiple TV screens and boxes of pizza. One TV even has an episode of Rick and Morty on! He's also VERY unfunny. The jokes he has are cringe-levels of bad. The only time you laugh because of him is because his facial expressions are consistently dumb. Also his running animation is bad. I find it outstanding how bad they made him. He straight up ruins just about every scene he's in simply by existing!<br/><br/>Steppenwolf is a very weak villain. From what I can grasp he just wants to take over Earth because he failed doing it in the past, and he needs three Tesseracts I MEAN... Mother Cubes... to do so. His design would have worked so much better as a version of Ares. It would have redeemed the ending of Wonder Woman for me if they had done so.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the effects aren't very good. Multiple times throughout the film I had to stop and point out to myself, ""oh that isn't really there, they aren't really there, that's a really obvious green screen"". I don't want to have to do that. If your effects aren't good, sorry, I'm gonna notice. Bad effects in this movie can sometimes ruin a scene or two... or fifteen.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I didn't like this as much as I hoped. I am glad I saw it, and because of the after-credits scene (which I won't give away), plus a thing they tease around midway through (go see it yourself), I'm hopeful for the future. Wait... isn't hope supposed to be something Superman inspires? Damn you DC! You're smarter than all of us give you credit for!"

","I was never a fan of comic books, but I've enjoyed comic book *movies* based on their individual merits and I don't subscribe to that whole DC vs Marvel thing. Iron Man and The Dark Knight are two of my favorite movies from the genre and, well, after Batman v Superman's dreary, soulless debut, I went into this with low expectations. After seeing so many 10 out of 10 ratings on IMDb, I was highly skeptical, especially with a number of bad reviews, calling this film 'mediocre' etc. I need not have worried.<br/><br/>It is excellent, and not just in comparison to its predecessor. I suspect superhero fatigue is the cause of some negative reviews, and frankly some reviewers complaints seem bizarre, like they missed some important dialog, or something. Avengers had an alien spacecube macguffin, and this has three, so yeah, the motives of the villain tend to be pretty simple in superhero movies, something I'd like to see addressed in future. Since so many villains tend to be underdeveloped, I can hardly fault this film for falling foul of the same problem (so I won't). Still better than Thor 2's villain!<br/><br/>The villain, while being a rather generic 'destroy the world type', has well written lines at least. And I thought he was brought down in a clever way (with callbacks!) His main purpose is to bring the heroes together, and it's quite well done (yes I'm surprised). <br/><br/>The character interactions are a highlight, not just with the primary cast but the supporting actors too. Victor Stone's tragic presence was palpable and I found his origin and capabilities fascinating, and hey, Aquaman isn't a joke anymore (though a bit heavy on the 'aquabro' stuff I think). Ben Affleck is probably my favorite version of Batman/Bruce Wayne, Gal Gadot brings her usual warmth and heart to the role, and the Flash had the right amount of levity to lighten the mood (though I can see some people finding his quips a bit too much)<br/><br/>Some have called this movie disjointed and 'stitched together', though it's not nearly as bad as suggested, and flowed quite smoothly for the most part. Events are explained to just the right degree, without too much or too little exposition. The overall visuals have rather uninspiring cgi and seem a bit dated, and the palette is 'confused', probably the result of bringing in another director once Zack Snyder had to step away (condolences to his family). But again, when it was over I had a smile on my face and I will definitely catch it again soon.<br/><br/>P.S. For the love of god, get Joss Whedon to edit BvS into something watchable, I'm sure there's a halfway decent movie in there somewhere."

I loved the banter between everyone. I can't wait to see the standalone movies. It's serious enough. It's funny enough. The villain was good. He served his purpose. Loved some of his lines. The film felt a bit rushed, but not enough to destroy the movie. I was so entertained that if there were others flaws, I did not see them. Also, the score was good to great! SEE THIS FILM! Superman... Superman...... That's all I'm going to say...<br/><br/>Stay strong WB/DC. Your films are getting better and better. You listened to your critics, fans and the general audience.

Well ""better late than never"" this franchise is quite good. It's like a dream come true for a JL fan like me. I literally enjoyed it. First I was in a conundrum after reading the reviews. But I decided to watch and it paid off. <br/><br/>Snyder really did a good job adding comedy and also making this film short not a pathetic 2.30 hours like ""BvS"". And this film was better than his previous two's. But I don't know why critics target his movie's ?? Whereas on the other hand each and every Marvel movie is getting rave reviews??<br/><br/>Acting of the cast :-<br/><br/>The acting of the cast was good; Ezra Miller as Barry Allen and Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry were really a great entertainers. I wasn't hoping that much good performance from Ezra as ""The Flash's"" TV series star Grant Gustin is phenomenal in this role. But Ezra really did justice to it. And I liked Aquaman's cool attitude in the movie !<br/><br/>Ben Affleck as Batman was good as he was in the last one BvS. Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot and Ray Fisher did justice to there roles. <br/><br/>Action sequences and tech's :-<br/><br/>The best action scene in the whole movie was of Wonder Woman's in her entry when she saves the hostages ; she killed it !! along with the slow motions shots it became even more delightful to watch ; The Night Crawler tech of Batman was beautiful and Cyborg what to say?? ""A human computer"" ; Flash's and Superman's scenes were good. <br/><br/>Overall I as a FAN of JL series enjoyed this movie and I will suggest others to go watch it.

","So we all know the critics love to pile on DC films and tell us how awful they are. Meanwhile all the things they point out are ten times as bad in a Marvel film but nobody complains. I completely disagree with the critics of Justice League. I think it's a great film for a few reasons. 1. They kept the pace fast. The two hour run time was perfect. There were no slow points in the film where it was just dialogue that nobody cares about. 2. The villain wasn't the main focus of the film, but he was new enough to most audiences to be interesting. Unlike some of the lame Marvel villains of late, this one is sort of a gateway to a villain of importance to the DCU. Let's be honest, none of these films have a villain anymore that's very compelling (since Heath Ledgers Joker). But in this case I thought he was different enough from what they've done previously to be interesting and spoiler alertÂ…. He's an agent of Darkseid who is the big bad they'll be working up to. 3. They kept the darker DC tone, but sprinkled in some humor via the flash. Not Thor level cheese. Just some humor. Where there things that weren't perfect? Sure. There were lots of corny lines that could have been done without and way too much CGI. But for the most part the film was a fun introduction to the rest of the DCU characters that haven't been on film yet. Check it out. I'd say it falls just behind Wonder Woman as far as ranking films in the DCU. Better than any non-guardians of the galaxy Marvel film since Avengers 1."

Gal Gadot is amazing as usual. What a great actress. Her appearance on movie is big part of the movie. Ezra Miller coulda been great as Wally West not Barry Allen. Because this character was Wally West's characteristics. But he was really funny. I think i can ignore that part. Jason Momoa was great as Aquaman. He was meant to be for his role. And i can't wait for Aquaman solo movie. And can't wait to see Nicole Kidman there. Ray Fisher shined through his role. Great cast. Great effects. Great acting.

","My 16 year wait is over. I have finally seen the first ever live action Justice League. And I have to say, other than being a bit short with a 2 hour run time, I really really enjoyed the movie. This movie is totally about the heroes. The chemistry and the way the heroes come together were fantastic. Batman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, Aquaman and most importantly the Flash had incredible chemistry. And don't worry you will be satisfied with a certain someone's return and his whole transition into being iconic. The villain is not the memorable with Steppenwolf's CGI work not being the greatest but he does what he needs to do to bring the heroes together."

","This movie was fantastic!! Am I going to say Justice League was perfect; no. It was not. No movie is. Especially superhero movies. But I'm not going to see a superhero movie to see a well written dialogue with an amazing pace and plot I'm going to see a super hero movie to watch people with unnatural abilities that we don't have (like flight, speed and strength) kick ass like in the comics. This movie delivered. The action was impeccable. It blew Marvel's little baby fighting action out of the water, which is surprising for me to say considering I love Marvel movies. This is how true superhero movies should look.<br/><br/>The 3 problems I had with it were 1) some CGI 2) pacing 3) duration of movie. I thought some CGI was off but that is understandable considering the amount in this movie, and it didn't effect my opinion of the movie. The pacing was off sometimes in the movie like in BvS, but that is only because Warner Bros set out a mandate that it couldn't be more than 2 hours. I love long movies and wished it would've been 2 hr 30 min like it was originally. Besides those issues, I thought it was fun, heart felt at times, and action packed. And finally they added post credits scenes which I will not go into detail about!! If you love having a good time, comic book movies and love watching your favorite childhood superhero movies on the big screen than go see Justice League! Hats off to Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon! Loved the music although I preferred Hans Zimmer because he is a legend.<br/><br/>Last but not least, don't listen to reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. They hate everything DC and only base movies on plot and pacing. They don't watch movies like normal people would and their reviews are not accurate to how real people seeing a movie would feel. They only watch the movie as a critic would not a fan. They go to see the movie because of their job not their love for the movie. And to be quite honest, I think that they believe people care about their opinions more than they really do. Go see the movie and decide how you feel about it for yourself! Hope you enjoyed this!"

","'JUSTICE LEAGUE': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The fifth installment in the DC Extended Universe, based on the DC comics superhero team, which unites Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg, for the first time on the big screen together (in an attempt for DC to imitate the success of Marvel Cinemas' 'THE AVENGERS'). DC even brought in Joss Whedon (the filmmaker behind the first two 'AVENGERS' movies) to co-write the screenplay, and direct $20 million worth of reshoots. Zack Snyder (who also helmed 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE', 'MAN OF STEEL', and co-wrote 'WONDER WOMAN') directed and co-wrote the film as well, with Whedon and Chris Terrio (who also co-wrote 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN'). The cast features Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot and Henry Cavill reprising their roles as Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman (from previous movies). Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller and Ray Fisher also costars as Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg (which they previously performed cameos as, in previous films). Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielson and Joe Morton also reprise roles from other movies too; while J.K. Simmons and Ciaran Hinds join the cast. The story deals with the superhero team forming, after the death of Superman, to battle a new supervillain named Steppenwolf, and his army of Parademons. The film has gotten mostly positive reviews from fans so far, and some critics even like it too. I was severely disappointed with the movie, and honestly found it to be mostly a bore (sadly). <br/><br/>The story takes place months after the death of Superman (Cavill), and the events of 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN', when an alien army of creatures called Parademons are invading Earth. They're lead by a military officer from Apocalypse, called Steppenwolf (Hinds). Steppenwolf is on a mission to find the three powerful 'Mother Boxes', that are all hidden on Earth. Bruce Wayne (Affleck) teams with Diana Prince (Gadot) to stop the invasion. The super duo seeks out three other gifted superheroes to help them; Aquaman (Momoa), The Flash (Miller) and Cyborg (Fisher). Together they form the superhero team called 'Justice League', for the first time.<br/><br/>The movie is really slow-paced at first (and for most of the film actually), and I was bored out of my mind at times. There's a lot of ineffective character development, in my mind, that doesn't really help develop the characters much. The action scenes are all uninvolving, and dull, in my opinion as well. This is coming from a fan who absolutely loved 'WONDER WOMAN' and 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN' ('SUICIDE SQUAD' and 'MAN OF STEEL' too, to a lesser degree), and I have been a bigger fan of the DC Extended Universe lately even (over the MCU). I have to admit this film just doesn't work for me though. That's not to say it's bad, or overly cheesy at all (that's why I'm still giving it 4 out of 5 stars). It just really let me down. I had really high hopes though, and I still do for future DC movies (especially 'WONDER WOMAN' films). Gadot is awesome in this still, even though she's not given enough to do, and she's the scene stealer (like always) definitely. I think she deserves top billing even."
"hashshaikh","8","2","6","17 November 2017"," Justice Served well! (A Honest Review)
","First let me say that i am both marvel and a DC Comic fan, and the PEOPLE WHO are nagging about this movie are not at all appreciating for WB to bring our comic book dreams to reality.<br/><br/>After watching a good but slow Man of steel, mediocre BVS, exciting Suicide Squad and a Brilliant Wonder Woman. I would say Justice League is the best and right step for WB and DC Comics.<br/><br/>Critics such as VOX, IGN and others are either paid to trash DC movies or they are simply IDIOTS who did not receive a party invite or some PR goodie bags by the WB.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>Ben affleck is again just real and catchy as Bruce Wayne/Batman (the best there has been) Gal Gadot is stunning period, Ray fisher as cyborg plays an integral part in the movie. I personally feel cyborg as an entity is quiet boring but ray does a good job on it. Ezra miller as Flash is beyond words, Funny and entertaining, i felt he brought the soul to the movie just like he did in the animated movies as well as the comics. Grant Gustin and Ezra Miller are both very unique and should not be COMPARED AT ALL!!! both are amazing in their respective portrayals. Jason Momoa as Aquaman finally shows that Aquaman is a real deal. A bit cocky aquaman but realistic on the live screen and finally Henry Cavil as Superman is light and what superman should be. I feel Man of steel 2 would be something to look forward too.<br/><br/>Direction of Zack Snyder and Reshoots of Josh is fairly visible, at times you know the tone of the movie is dark but its still very much lighter than BVS. story is a bit rushed but it does touch the important issues like why stepen wolf would hunt these boxes. The overall tone and the occasional banters give you a feel good sense.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>The first 25 minutes in the movie and you start to feel it might be a bore show, but as the story progresses it fairly feels good and covers up for its problem, The main problem of the movie was the Villain, stepen wolf does not feel like a strong menace, he was weak and taken down easily by superman, i felt he could have terrorized a bit more at least could be a match for superman. even General Zod and Doomsday felt more dangerous than wolf, the CGI on him was a big let down. Rushed story and scenes of aquaman underwater could have used a more lighter tone. DC Need a STRONG Villain if they ever want to get absolute 10/10.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>On the whole i feel Justice league was a step ahead for DC and WB, Cyborg and Flash have good potential so does Aquaman and Superman. Wonder woman will get another movie, I would like to see Ben play batman in a solo movie to see its potential. Justice League is just light hearted and amazing. Money well spent, and i would desperately wait for the other DC movies to see their Vision. 7 stars for the amazing movie and +1 for the justice done by Josh.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Go and see it, Worth the money, 8/10.<br/><br/>Just to add there are Two end credit scenes and a lot of Easter eggs especially in the backstory of Stepen Wolf narrated by Gal Gadot."

"mondwayemail","8","2","6","16 November 2017"," From Great to just OK
","Justice League A fulfillment but just an OK movie. Characters: - like in Wonder Woman, Gal Galdot's a super model in action. She S doing most of the work and talking. She S like, ""look at my face."" - it did justice to Aquaman. Tall, bearded, long-haired dude, like Hemsworth, can produce such a macho man with unique humor. Jason Momoa makes me think it s great to get tattoos. Just think. - great pairing of Wonder Woman and Aqua man during the fight. I smell Flashpoint. - Ezra Miller as The Flash is likable but I still don't like the costume. - I feel so dissatisfied Amber Heard's Mera didn't have enough scenes. She a hot. - I still don't find Ben Affleck is effective as burned out Bruce Wayne. His Batman is OK but as Bruce is not. - I didn't like Sups new costume. He S a beefcake though. Like in BvS, I like it when they use krptonian music from MOS. Story: - the film doesn't have much substance. Take it like as the entry for the other upcoming JL films but it has the ""oh god no fu*** way"" part and ""Oh my god, they re in trouble"" scene. - the story S very simple. Bring the team together to fight. But I didn't feel the need for it. - I m getting the feeling that Joss Whedon didn't do or removed a lot of the intended scenes from the original script, or Zack Snyder failed to finish bcz of his departure from the production. - if you ve watched other Zack Snyder films, you re gonna feel it s missing a lot of things. - First half was really engaging and exciting, the other half's turned into ""what? That's that?"""
"ayoreinf","8","2","6","16 November 2017"," DC keeps improving, this one is way better than the previous ones
","No, it's not a masterpiece like The Dark Knight or Logan, but it's one of the best DC has come up with in a long while. I don't count Wonder Woman in this list because it took place in a completely different setting, an entire century ago. It was more of a period piece comic than any of the other failures. And it used the period piece attitude to its advantage.<br/><br/>This was the very first DC comics production set in our times that used humor properly, it might have something to do with Joss Whedon's role in the production, but it's not important ""who's to blame"", the fact that the jokes work is what matters. Bigger than life characters can either be able to laugh at themselves or they come out pompous. A pompous super hero is unattractive, and very hard to take in a film that goes for about two hours.<br/><br/>Another big point in favour of this movie, is the acting. This one is an ensemble piece in the best way. Each part of the cast gives its share to the final outcome. Even Ben Afleck's stone face are made to work, when Batman is written to suit his limitations. Ezra Miller is wonderful as the Flash, showing the promise we all felt when we saw him in Fantastic Beasts is coming to fruition. Gal Gadot is improving as I predicted she would. She simply makes the role her own, and is much better than she was in Wonder Woman, where she was all right, and did show signs of the talent she has. Thing is, every one is giving his/hers share. Even the small roles are well written.<br/><br/>There's is only one major fault I find with this movie - its villain. Steppenwolf, is one of the most one dimensional villains you could come up with. He'll do all right in a group of super villains. He can't carry the whole antagonist part of the movie by himself. Yes he does look strong and even scary, but that's not enough. There's nothing more there, and the potential did exist. He did fail to conquer earth once before, it's hardly mentioned. the special hatred that should be felt is neglected by the script. Steppenwolf simply hates everything, and shows very little emotion at all. I believe that with more attention to his character the movie would've been a better one."
"thepetshopboy","8","2","6","16 November 2017"," Quite enjoyable romp...looking forward to the next one.
","Saw a special screening last night and was somewhat surprised as to how much I enjoyed it given Batman vs. Superman's failings. Snyder/Whedon made the smart move of putting Wonder Woman front and center in this given she's a far more interesting character then Affleck's Batman (and Cavill's Superman doesn't show up until late in the film). Add to that the inclusion of some much needed humour with Mamoa's Aquaman and Ezra Miller's Flash (both of which I hope get their own standalone films in the DCU) and you have a DC movie you can actually call fun!"
"leegato","7","2","6","15 November 2017"," A Surprising Ode to the DC Fans
","After the polarizing reception of Batman v Superman (which I personally liked) and outright negative attention of Suicide Squad, I came in to this movie with low expectations. But I was certainly surprised. Justice League feels natural; it has the Zack Snyder visuals with the crisp Joss Whedon editing to maintain the perfect pacing and energy for the comic book spectacle that is this film.<br/><br/>Justice League is certainly more lighthearted than its predecessors, but it still maintains a tasteful amount of seriousness to it when needed in the storyline. While Man of Steel and Batman v Superman focused on the realistic societal aspects of a world with superheroes, which I think was one of the strengths of the DC films, this societal realism is not as prevalent in Justice League. This would make sense, given that this is literally a superhero team that's getting together; society is less of a concern when they know it's in danger. Also, having too much emphasis on societal realism has shown to hurt the pacing of the films, as noted in previous examples.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film doesn't feel like it was trying to copy a Marvel formula, and shows DC managed to find the formula that has worked for them. The storyline itself is a basic superhero team versus big baddie and nothing special, but various moments in the story help flesh out the characters and add a fun spin here and there with the skeletal outline to help further develop the relationship between the team members. Nothing in the story feels ""forced."" The writing/dialogue is decent and characterizes our heroes perfectly to create a unique dynamic between each one. Standout performances are Ezra Miller as Barry Allen and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman (as always).<br/><br/>This film is by no means perfect and certainly has flaws. The film can be visually tiring with the Zack Snyder brand of special effects and CGI backgrounds, and the fight scenes can be repetitive (not nearly as long as Man of Steel, however). The character development can also sometimes be lacking with the supporting characters, as per Zack Snyder style. More can also certainly have been explored with the main characters, especially with Superman and Aquaman's stories that are all but briefly mentioned and minimally explored. But these flaws only apply to minor aspects of the film's overall arc for the group as a team, and don't impact the enjoyment you'll likely get out of this film.<br/><br/>Justice League is, at the end of the day, an ode to the comic book fans. The film is littered with references to the DC Universe that'll make any fan excited, and be sure to watch out for two post credits scenes. It's been a while since I felt this excited and hyped for the future of a franchise (i.e. pre-Avengers Marvel films), and fellow superhero fans are certainly in for a treat for this entertaining thrill ride of a film.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"brookenichole-98054","9","1","2","12 June 2020"," The best superhero film
","Justice League is amazing. I honestly can't find one thing wrong with this movie. The CGI was good, the acting was fantastic, and the story line was exciting. Every characters side story fit well and made me so invested in each of them. The story made me excited for each scene along with all the action scenes. I loved seeing everyone's powers being used. One of the best scenes in the movie was the beginning. The music with Superman dead was heartbreaking but did a wonderful job showing the world falling apart. The chemistry and teamwork was outstanding. This movie did what I wish Marvel movies would do. It had teamwork and the chemistry I try to find in all Marvel movies. Overall, I loved every second of it."

","Out of the hundreds of movies I have seen, I have only fallen asleep a few times, and Justice League (2017) is one of those times. Everything about this film is mishandled - the villain is boring and cartoonish, the effects are terrible, the story is a long bore with too many tangents, the characters are uninteresting and the action is messy. The only highlight is a brief battle scene involving Superman that is the only reason I didn't give this a lower rating."

I Think for the Main-Viewers it was an too unknown characters and they should have taken an more popular Character / Villian for the first Justice League movie......
Stepppenwolf may be a worthy Adversary for the Justice League but....well i just think he is too unknown<br/><br/>Darkseid is THE BIG ENDGAME for the DCCU like Thanos is for the MCU ..... but will we ever see him on the big screen or in a potential Justice League Sequel ?<br/><br/>I sure hope so"
"zacharylennard","1","1","2","23 December 2019"," Late 2019 review. Yes, I intentionally chose to give Justice League a review at a very later date
","As we all know at this point, Justice League's Production was infamously known for studio interference, meddling with the final product, and the tragic loss of Autumn Snyder, may she rest in peace. Because of Zack Snyder's family tragedy, he was forced to step down from production of Justice League. Warner Bros chose to not delay the film, but rather take advantage of the entire situation. They overhauled the entire post production very poorly by mandating a two hour runtime, and tasking Joss Whedon with overseeing reshoots, which is later confirmed to be exactly 90% of the theatrical cut, rather than the 10%-15% Joss Whedon try to pass. It's also confirmed that Zack Snyder's Cut was over 3.5 Hours, it would have had an R-Rating, which I would have expected Warner Bros to tone down to PG-13 in order to reach a farther demographic audience viewing wise, which I would completely understand and forgive if that was the only change made to this film, but, wasn't. Because of the major backlash from fans in response to the Justice League, or what others may call, ""Josstice League"", which I think is really unfair because he was doing what Warner Bros wanted him to do, it wasn't like he had a choice, he was doing what they wanted him to do, they started #ReleaseTheSnyderCut, which is a campaign that supports the release of the original version of Justice League and due to reports of the film being completely far from a finished product, I can see, at the time, however, that Warner Bros would not want to put money into it, especially after the $300,000,000 budget for the theatrical release. As time passes on, it is revealed that the film is near completion than originally what was thought of, due to a massive amount of posts on Zack Snyder's official VERO, and that there are rumors circulating that Zack Snyder used his own resources to complete his version. Because his version is now, clearly by the posts and support of the cast, crew, and Jason Momoa's review of the Snyder Cut, it is clear that it is by far superior than what we saw in Theaters. Now, does that mean the entirety of Warner Bros/Joss Whedon Cut of the film was complete garbage? My answer is No. There were genuine scenes I did find enjoyable. The fight sequence at Heroes park was meh at most. Again, being much kinder with word choice, but the Flash trying to outrun Superman in the fight between the heroes and him, was absolutely hilarious. I thought it was really funny. And Batman saying that something is definitely bleeding after that cringey line from Superman when holding Batman, that, I thought, was funny as well. But, overall, I would say that the film's failure is entirely on the executives at Warner Bros. They made excessively poor decisions, which they have yet to admit, and because of the merger between the Studio and AT&T at the time, focused on rushing production rather than delaying the film so they can get their bonus checks, which was later revealed that the bonus checks could've valued more if GOOD CHOICES WERE MADE. Overall, the movie is less than meh, which would be a 5.5/10, but, because of Studio meddling, that brings it down to a 1/10. I am more than willing to change my review in a more positive rating if Warner Bros do decide to release the Snyder Cut and do right by their fans. But, until then, I'm not changing anything I have said."
"PartialMovieViewer","10","1","2","1 December 2019"," Now This is How Things Should be Done
","To start of with, I was no fan of ""Man of Steel."" I really thought Bob Smith (or whatever his name is), was not a Clark Kent/Superman kind of guy. Well, that opinion needs to be walked back quite a bit. I actually like Bob's portrayal of Superman, he has a personality and a sense of humor - excellent. ""Wonder Woman"", was one of my favorite movies I saw the year it came out. Roberta Smith, or whatever her name is, did a fantastic job, and since she was a two year member of the IDF, she actually walked the walk. Ms. Smith is perfect for her part. Aquaman seems pretty cool, although I am new to him in movies. Another one I liked was Flash. The one I had some reservations about was Ben Affleck as Batman. Gag, no way could Ben play the Dark Knight - no freaking way. Ok, well he actually is one of best actors to play Batman. The guy is outstanding and should not abandon the part. Anyways, what was good about this movie? I mean other than the great cast. Why was flick so much better than that other fiasco with the 100 or so superheroes fighting some really, really, really super villain. That should explain the whole reason. Too many heroes crowded on the screen so I didn't care what happened to them. This was an easy to digest story, the script flowed well and the director ensured all characters had their own identity and importance to the story. Job well done."

Ben Affleck as Batman is growing on me. Gal Gadot is awesome as WW. The rendering of Cyborg is great. Aquaman is just okay. But the guy who plays the Flas is all wrong. Weak, awkward... I just want to hit him for some reason. 
The storyline is a bit blah. And, frankly, Superman's strength makes the point of a team seem redundant. The other heroes can stay home - just call Superman.

Wish DC had done a couple of solo movies on them so we could get up to speed on just who they are. Enjoyed Aquaman's performance. Look forward to his movie coming up. Flash was cute for a while, but really needs to dig a bit deeper or he could just become a silly comic relief character. Cyborg was the one character not very developed so felt like I was behind on who he is. The fight scenes with the Amazon women were very good, but I can't say as much for the scenes in Atlantis - really would have liked to see more of it. The villains could have been a bit more scary and menacing. Could have helped this out during the back story segment. Needed Steppenwolf to really be a big bad guy, but didn't really quite come off. He was defeated way to easily. Then there is the lack of color in DC movies? What is that all about? All in all, it was an ok movie. For now, I will stick with Marvel."

This is by no means the fault of Ben Afleck he looks great as batman he has the bulk for the role, he can fight as seen in Batman V Superman the problem is that they made him to real batman has to have something special their animated movies show it perfectly but in these real life adaptation he is just a guy in a batsuit with money and that works in a universe where he fights against regular villains with no superpowers but in this universe they need to give him something special just a bit stronger than a regular human and smarter and more dangerous. As for the movie itself i enjoyed it, enough action scenes, just enough backstory to get who the villain is (how ever a bit of comic knowledge would help a lot), and nice cgi I really liked how the transformation of earth looked, and Ezra as the flash a great choice he plays the character really good with his all new i don't know what this is all about ake on the role and his running scenes are incredible as well. i really recommend watching this movie and see for yourself if it is enjoyable or not."

","I did not care at all for Man of Steel. It was insulting as a comic book movie and as a movie about people. BvS was better but the CGI looked way too cartoonish. Wonder Woman was over-hyped, but still entertaining. Justice League, in my opinion, comes very close to getting it right...almost.<br/><br/>First the bad. I simply cannot understand how in this day and age, DC still churns out such horrible CGI. It still looks cartoonish. It takes me out of the movie every time. (Wonder Woman had this same issue). The villain was lame with no other role than to be a plot device to get a League together. Lastly, Batman is just a man, but he gets thrown into walls and cars with nary an impact. His CGI scenes are the worst which is quizzical since he's a man so they should have used a stuntman. If you needed CGI, then just don't use the scene. Lastly, as other reviewers have mentioned, they rushed the team up. We have no vested interest in Aquaman, Flash, or Cyborg and a barely competent movie, IMO, of Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Now the good. I liked the story. I thought the way they got the heroes together was well done. I really like Affleck's Batman. Bale is going to be the ultimate Batman for most because of the movies he was in. I think Affleck makes a better Batman, but his movies have stunk. Ezra Miller is a wonderful Flash. I think his character had just the right amount of wonder, fear, and courage. Also his comedic relief was perfectly played. Jason Mamoa was also excellent as Aquaman. I thought this character was going to be a joke, but Mamoa did a really nice job. Ray Fisher's Cyborg needed to be fleshed out (no pun intended) a bit more, but there is a really interesting character there. They still can't seem to figure out what to do with Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. She is too wooden and doesn't emote which is strange for a character that is supposed to be the leader. The supporting cast was okay, but didn't have much to do other than to be thrown in so we don't forget they exist.<br/><br/>Henry Cavill's portrayal of Superman in this movie should have been how the character was handled in MoS and BvS. What a wasted opportunity for those other films. He was charming, seemed to actually enjoy life, and had a nice chemistry with the other characters. I loved Cavill in The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and never could figure out why they wanted him to play Superman as such a dullard.<br/><br/>One special mention is the scene where Superman is resurrected. This seems to be one of those scene you either hate or love. I really loved it. For me, it was the highlight of the DCU so far. If you've ever been under anesthesia, you know how disorienting and frustrating it can be when you awake and don't know where you are. Playing it this way, I thought, really brought out how dangerous Superman could have been (as Bruce mentions in BvS) should he not be benevolent. My favorite part was Wonder Woman telling Aquaman to calm down and Aquaman replying, ""I can't. He ain't right."" Flash tries to run around behind Superman and, in slow motion, Superman is turning to keep up with him, totally freaking out Barry (and me, to be honest). That entire scene from start to finish was well written, entertaining, made sense in the realm of the plot, and was a ton of fun.<br/><br/>It looks like DC might be finally figuring out their characters. They really need to hold off on Justice League 2 until they have given the others their own movies and maybe let them do cameos in each others' films. They rushed to get this movie out because they felt they were behind Marvel. Take your time. Be patient. You have a wealth of great characters here and you only get one chance to not screw this all up. At least you're not Universal."

","Lets be serious. Who is the main target audience for superhero movies? Obviously teens, kids and people toward the young side. Now, lets get to the course of the film. I didn't get to watch batman vs superman, so i got a little bit confused. Now here is the thing. There is so much conversation that I would have had trouble memorizing the scripts of this film as compared to if i had to memorize an entire philosophy textbook. But don't get me wrong. The film is not too bad. Apart from the main course at the end which i will get to later, the whole film is just about Batman tryna get his 'JL' team together, and that process is longer than my mom's nagging ever! Not much action from each character especially from the Flash, who was my favourite during their introduction, but that is not what got me a off. There was this scene where Superman was revived and the 'JL' team tried to reboot his memory by fighting him. He actually manages to pin down Wonder Woman, Cyborg, Aquaman and Batman by himself. Hell, pretty strong! And then the Flash comes in, runs just slightly pass Superman's vision, and they fight right there, the 'JL' team still floating(Superman flung them). Supermna not only has more than all their strength combined, he has the speed of the Flash. What the hell? I'd like to end it off with this. In the ending, Superman threw a punch at the enemy and that somewhat was the way he got defeated. One...punch... What is the point of the title ""Justice League"" if you're gonna give the credits all to one character?"
"connorjblack","6","1","2","14 April 2018"," Disappointing but not entirely terrible.
","A disappointing sequel to Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, whilst I loved those previous movies and the way they set up Justice League, this movie did not live up to expectations. Warner Bros. decision to fire Zack Snyder during production and its impact on the film with Avengers director Joss Whedon is clear here as the film seems to not be able to decide on a tone as it shifts often throughout the film with lots of forced and unnecessary humour used to 'lighten up' the film, this attempt was poorly executed.
The films CGI is messy at parts but most notably Superman's jaw was not well edited in attempt to remove Henry Cavill's moustache; other examples of bad effects caused during re-shoots are obvious green screens being see-able, camera angles being off and more.
Whilst I was dis-satisfied with the film overall it did however have its charms such as the resurrection of superman and the final battle against Steppenwolf were mostly well done. Most of what was already shot by Zack Snyder was well done and I wish Warner Bros. would release his cut of the movie as I am sure that what he did is better than what we got."

There was no better bad guy than this clown, who wouldn't have been impressive even if they hadn't seemingly gone out of their way to make him boring. What happened to Darkseid? That was what I was watching for. Then again, they would have messed him up, so maybe I am glad he did not show up. This is a re-skinned Suicide Squad. Characters we don't know or care about, and a less-than-one-dimensional villain. This movie tried to rip-off the Avengers formula and failed miserably. Just rent it.

"slicedbread117","3","1","2","20 March 2018"," A Product of a Broken Franchise
","I never in my life would have thought that the release of the first live-action Justice League film would not have me up in arms with excitement. But even with the stellar 'Man of Steel' that kicked off the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), the three atrocities of film that have followed over the last two years have made that never-having thought a reality. Even with nearly zero interest and the lowest of expectations, getting my own opinion is a must for these films, and there's always a sliver of hope that DC can right the ship that is this mess of a franchise. Not to my surprise, Justice League (JL) met my incredibly low expectations with ease, producing yet another abysmal film and proving that the DCEU is still stuck in a state of desolation.<br/><br/>You could say Justice League is an apparent result of two directors and two visions, because, well it is. Initial director/writer Zack Snyder, whose vision for the DCEU has utterly destroyed the franchise, had to step away for personal reasons, leaving Avengers director Joss Whedon to fill in the blanks. This dual vision pulls the film apart, creating a tug-of-war feeling between Snyder's story and tones and Whedon's. For better or worse, Warner Bros. should have made the executive decision to either have Whedon fully execute Snyder's original intents, or to completely scrap it in favor of Whedon's ideas. Even if Snyder's full cut would have made it through, at least it would have had a consistent tone. The divisiveness creates a misdirected narrative which is unoriginal, unfocused and ultimately bland. DC can't seem to hit the sweet spot of proper pacing either, as JL continues the trend from 'Batman v Superman' of an incoherent, poorly edited script, which in turn for me, was often simply boring. I'm not sure who's green-lighting the story decisions at Warner Bros., but this script is another completely uninspired narrative full of plot holes and an enormous lack of vision, but the greatest tragedy of all, is the writing of the characters.<br/><br/>When I think of the Justice League, there's one thing that immediately comes to mind before anything else; a team of seven iconic, defined and developed characters at the forefront. JL has many flaws, but hands down, its dearth of compelling, well written characters is the wound that cuts deepest. The writing of just about every character is deficient. They lack, sophistication, lack depth, with little heart to make you care about them. There was little to invoke any sort of inspirational, emotionally engaging response to the characters, which creates major disconnect and in turn gives a response of weak interest. Most characters weren't given proper screen time, or enough meaningful screen time, while some side characters (Commissioner Gordon, Mera) were awesome but wasted in their DCEU debut with no room to develop them, since there wasn't even enough room to develop the main characters. Worst of all, nearly every character felt hopelessly dumbed down. Batman was turned into a comedic Tony Stark rip-off, Flash is given too many corny one liners to count and though I wasn't a huge fan of Wonder Woman's solo outing, she felt infinitely more empowering than she did here.<br/><br/>What's not missing is sincere acting talent, but most of it is wasted on the dreadful writing. Some of the actors do their best with what they got; Ezra Miller (Flash), Henry Cavill (Superman) and Jason Momoa (Aquman) are still enjoyable while other high-level stars like Amy Adams, Jermey Irons and J.K. Simmonds are sorely unused on screen. Ben Affleck seems as though he's already given up playing a compelling Bruce Wayne, a major downgrade from his admirable performance in BvS while Ray Fisher's portrayal as Cyborg was terribly one-dimensional.<br/><br/>The absence of proper character development can be traced back to DC's initial decision to seemingly rush their franchise's progress to play catch up with Marvel's success. While Superman and Wonder Woman have had their own films, JL proves that well known characters can't just be thrown together without the audience having any reason to care about them, and have their movie sell on namesake alone. It's shameful, because there are bright spots. Most notably Superman, who, when he's actually in the movie, is accurate to the comics and is easily the most enjoyable character. Aquaman and Flash have moments of humor and awesomeness, the former more so than the later, but no dedicated story arcs to provide anything of substance. Had they gotten solo films before this team up, that could've panned out much differently. Batman falls under the same category. His character direction is the most disappointing by far, and as my favorite superhero of all time, he was lackluster. We hear about Batman's 20+ years of crime fighting before JL, but how beneficial would it have been to this franchise to see some of those stories with appearances from other characters before this film. It would have added a level of character development and chemistry that DC just doesn't have. The absence of a seventh member is a dagger as well, with no dedicated Green Lantern being a noticeable hole in the team, but in retrospect, his addition could have further convoluted the script.<br/><br/>Then there's the villain. Steppenwolf is the definition of a lifeless cardboard antagonist. Generic motives, the cheesiest of dialogue, and by God, the worst eye sore I've seen since Dr. Doom in the latest Fantastic 4 film. He's presented to be a big bad but isn't entertaining or threatening in the slightest. Steppenwolf makes Malekith from 'Thor: The Dark World' look good, and that's really bad. Not boasting a meaningful set of characters, primary or secondary, buried JL before it could even get going, and as far as Cyborg goes, let's just say he's not only the worst hero in the movie by a long shot, he's one of the worst heroes in superhero movie history.<br/><br/>Batman v Superman may have been a hot mess of film, but one thing it had going for it was high-octane action scenes. Justice League, for the most part, can't say the same. There are some cool action sequences no doubt. When the team works together, especially with Superman, it's at its best. There's also an awesome but quick flashback battle scene and an impressive underwater action section that makes me more excited for the upcoming Aquaman film. But at large, most of the action was sluggish and some characters (Batman, Cyborg) were underutilized. The third act in general just didn't deliver the action on the level a film of this grandeur should. What's most shocking, however, is the baffling awful CGI. Like, ridiculously bad. It starts right off the bat with Superman's mustache removal, which was laughably terrible and a major distraction through the film. I already touched on how awful Steppenwolf looked, the backdrops and atmospheres looked thoroughly unconvincing and then there's Cyborg who sticks out worse than a sore thumb, whatever that analogy might be. Batman and Superman look amazing in costume and it delivers minor appealing spectacle, but even with a massive budget, JL is not aesthetically attractive whatsoever.<br/><br/>I love DC at large just as much as Marvel. The Dark Knight remains my favorite film of all time, and I discovered a new-found love for Superman following Man of Steel. But the DCEU is in chaos. Iconic characters are being put to shame, a potential juggernaut franchise with excellent acting talent is being wasted with deplorable writing and decision making. Of course, I want to see DC movies succeed but at this point, the best option seems to hit the reset button. Justice League has slim moments of redeeming entertainment value, but overall represents a shining example of almost everything that is wrong with this film universe. The DCEU is a broken franchise, a tidal wave of misery, and Justice League is the latest to suffer from its wrath.<br/><br/>3/10"

"DeBBss","7","1","2","12 March 2018"," DC rising up...
","There was only two DC movies released in 2017, Wonder Woman and Justice League. Justice League was a good movie, like Wonder Woman. The DC movies released in 2016 were pretty trash, but 2017 was a good year for DC, and other superhero movies. I really did enjoy Justice League for what it is, but the problem was that there was no hype. There should be massive amounts of hype surrounding Justice League, but there wasn't that much for a movie like this. If DC took their time and release movie by movie, explaining each character, then there would be much more amounts of hype. I don't want to see the Justice League characters band up in one movie, then explain the characters later in their own movies in the upcoming years. Marvel took ten years to explain each character, and then put them in a movie teaming up all together, I'm talking about Avengers: Infinity War. DC took less than half of the time that Marvel took, but if Justice League was trash, then Marvel would have no competition, fortunately Justice League was a good movie.<br/><br/>Story: 6/10<br/><br/>The story is beyond average. Justice League has that very average superhero story, like, the good guys find the threat, the good guys have a plan to save the world, the good guys end the bad guys, The End. I pretty much described the story in a few sentences. Justice League relies on the ""Save the world, or everyone will die"" story. I have to be honest, I'm sick of the end of the world story, it's way too predictable, and you always know what's going to happen. Stories like Marvel's Logan is a good one, for example: Logan doesn't have to save the world, he has to save himself and the people around him. The story is about Logan's world, not the whole world. Now back to Justice League. The villain plot is a cliche too. Stop the bad guy before he gets this and that before it gets too late. Gladly, the plot wasn't boring. I was slightly interested by the plot. The plot didn't get lost in it's self or any other subplot, the movie had one motive, and it was a basic one. I'm so happy that Justice League didn't try to explain the characters' origins thoroughly, it would be subplot heaven. The last thing I want mention is the cubes. Basically the bad guy has to collect these powerful cubes to end the world, and I hate that. Make it like the bad guy didn't need anything, and all he had to do was just land there and end the world, it would've been more intense. Overall, the story suffers from an average plot and of plenty cliches, also the bad guy plot was weak.<br/><br/>Characters: 7/10<br/><br/>The Justice League characters were decent, but the villain was terrible, physically and mentally. Physically, Steppenwolf (The villain) didn't seem powerful whatsoever. I knew straight from the beginning that Steppenwolf would manage to do nothing, he didn't even hurt a fly. Mentally, he wasn't scary nor intimidating. The Justice League team was far better. Some characters got their own movies, some got movies to explain their relationships between others (Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice). The Flash in this movie was surprising, I have to say. Flash makes the other characters look boring. I don't want to say that Flash was funny, but he is the most unique character in the movie. I did feel like some of the characters besides Seppenwolf was dragging. Aquaman felt out of place in this movie to me. If the characters had their own movie before Justice League, than maybe they would be OK, but Aquaman felt so pointless accept for only one scene. Overall, the characters were good, some felt very out of place and some characters, like Steppenwolf were just simply terrible.<br/><br/>Action: 9/10<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Justice League mainly because of the action. I was never bored, there was action left, right, and center. Justice League has one little issue, the CGI. At some scenes the CGI makes sense and it looks good, but some scenes were just overkill. Near the ending of the movie, there was just too much CGI, and it must have burned a lot of budget. I also liked how they choreographed the fight scenes. Each character was working together in different ways, like Flash and Superman were saving the people and Flash and Cyborg were working together at some scenes to stop the cubes from ending the Earth. One last thing I would like to mention is how amazing the CGI was for Gotham City. Gotham City is supposed dark and rainy, and Justice League did exactly that. Overall, the action is entertaining and unique. The CGI was a bit too much, but it does set the mood for the entire movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Justice League was a superb superhero movie. The action was at its best, and the CGI helped the action, and sometimes it didn't help. The Justice League team roster was well done, but some characters felt a bit out of place. The villain was terrible, bland and just weak. The story was decent, but it does suffer from all the superhero cliches. But DC still hasn't learned from their mistakes. DC hasn't took their time with their movies, especially in Justice League. The pacing was a bit off, but not to the point that it ruined the movie. And I have to say, Henry Cavill's face looked like a cut scene from a 2008 video game, the CGI did poorly with removing Cavill's mustache. Justice League was a good DC movie and I strongly recommend it to anyone, you can enjoy it anytime."

Such an impressive roster of supers in a time when superhero mania is at its highest should have been a safe bet at the box-office, especially since Marvel's B-list characters like Ant-Man and Doctor Strange have been pulling in $500-600 million worldwide. How Justice League limped to just $700 million worldwide on the back of little to no fan anticipation speaks volumes about audience investment in this DC Universe. Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman won back some faith, but returning director Zack Snyder has learned nothing from the criticism and backlash Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice received.<br/><br/>This is the same turgid, ugly and CGI-infested world started by Man of Steel, complete with one-note characters, headache-inducing fight scenes and plain bad storytelling. Yet, due to Snyder leaving the project in post-production as a result of tragic family circumstances, this makes up roughly half of the movie. The rest is purely Joss Whedon's input, after The Avengers' helmer was brought in to tighten up the film, re-write certain scenes, and take charge of the necessary re-shoots. Reports have surfaced recently that Snyder's rough cut was simply unwatchable, and sensing another critical panning, Warner Bros. simply cut their losses. Even the re-shoots were news worthy, as Henry Cavill, sporting an impressive moustache for his role in the upcoming Mission: Impossible - Fallout, was under contract to keep the facial hair, and so his upper lip would need to be altered with special effects. Naturally, the final film - which had a reported $300 million sunk into it - is a catastrophic mess.<br/><br/>Superman is dead, and the world has sunk into a state of despair. After taking down an alien scout during one of his crime-busting jaunts, the ageing Bruce Wayne, aka Batman (Ben Affleck), senses that a bigger threat is coming to Earth. A rich man in a stealthy suit won't be enough to tackle such an enemy, so he proceeds to round up his new friend Diana Prince, aka Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), and hunt down those meta-humans glimpsed on Lex Luthor's laptop in Batman v Superman. There's Arthur Currie, aka Aquaman (Jason Momoa), the long-haired, tattooed Prince of Atlantis, Barry Allen aka The Flash (Ezra Miller), a motor-mouthed, incredibly annoying young man whose superpower is to run really, really fast, and finally Victor Stone, aka Cyborg (Ray Fisher), a half-human, half-machine hybrid who was created by his father with the help of a mysterious artefact called a Mother Box. There's two more boxes, and a giant alien warlord named Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciaran Hinds) hopes to snatch up all three.<br/><br/>You can work out almost on a moment-by-moment basis which segments were filmed by Snyder and which by Whedon. One second, were in the dour, unattractive world of Snyder's mind, where every character broods and walks in slow-motion. The next, we get quippy Batman and bright colours. Justice League became such a farce in post-production that I get the feeling the heads at Warner Bros. simply wanted rid of it, as this simply isn't the finished version of 300 million dollars worth of input. Steppenwolf's appearance changes from one scene to the next, and Cavill's moustache-removal is one of the most unnerving things I've seen on film. ""We're not enough,"" claims Batman, and so Superman is dug up and brought back to life for the final act. Despite his weird CGI face, Cavill is actually one of the few pleasures of Justice League, as we finally get to see the hopeful, unstoppable Superman we have been waiting three movies to see. Sadly, his comeback is far too late to save the movie. For all its plot-holes, poorly-constructed action scenes and many other flaws, Justice League's biggest crime is that it is, inexplicably, just plain boring."

"josiahcoulter","4","1","2","15 February 2018"," Another DC Misstep
","Hoo boy, where do I begin? In 2013, DC Comics and Warner Bros. rebooted the Superman franchise with the summer blockbuster Man of Steel. The film was a box office success and many people felt it was a welcoming makeover for the cultural icon, although some opined that it leaned too heavily into the darker themes of The Dark Knight trilogy and abandoned the lighter tone of Superman's origin.<br/><br/>After the success of Man of Steel, DC announced it would begin crafting an interconnected movie universe (similar to the massively popular Marvel Cinematic Universe) utilizing the company's most famous characters. The divisive Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice followed in 2016, with the critically maligned Suicide Squad released later in the same year, and the acclaimed Wonder Woman following in 2017.<br/><br/>Justice League is the most recent DC offering and has been touted as DC's version of Marvel's The Avengers. Starring Batman, Wonder Woman, Superman, Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg, it was expected to be a major superhero heavy-hitter. Unfortunately, like the franchise as a whole, Justice League proved to be an inconsistent mess and an overall disappointment.<br/><br/>Directed by Zack Snyder with additional direction by Joss Whedon, who took over in the middle of production after Snyder stepped down due to his daughter's suicide, Justice League follows in the footsteps of Snyder's other works by being flashy and overly complex with little real substance. The story is a bloated, convoluted mess and it doesn't help that, unlike The Avengers, the movie never had much of a solid foundation to build off of. The villain's intentions are confusing, the Mother Boxes are poorly explained, new characters and locations are tossed in without any proper introduction, and it takes almost half of the movie's runtime to even bring Superman back from the dead.<br/><br/>The quality of the acting is decidedly mixed. Gal Gadot leads the way and shines as the DC universe's breakout star Wonder Woman. Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, and Ray Fisher are all surprisingly fun and delightful as Aquaman, The Flash, and Cyborg. Ben Affleck seems bored as Batman and he has every right to be as the character really isn't given much to do throughout the course of the movie except attempt to rally the Justice League members together (which Wonder Woman ends up doing much more handily anyway). The same can be said for Henry Cavill as Superman, who is relegated to playing a violent, angry Superman who doesn't return to his normal self until just before the film's final act. Ugh, and why do they even continue to include the enormously talented Amy Adams in these films if they're not going to even attempt to make Lois Lane anything more than a plot device for Superman?<br/><br/>But perhaps the movie's biggest flaw are the truly atrocious visual effects. Big budget superhero movies can often get away with a thin story by dazzling audiences with impressive visuals. Justice League can't even do that. One of the most expensive films ever made with a production budget of $300 million, I honestly can't figure out where all that money went to. The action sequences are a jumbled mess with garish special effects and awful cinematography. Steppenwolf, the film's main villain, is an entirely CGI creation and quite literally looks like something out of a 2007 PS3 video game. And don't even get me started on the Superman ""Lipgate."" How the visual effects team managed to mess up a simple mustache removal is beyond me.<br/><br/>Overall, Justice League is a truly bad film with only a few acting performances and character interactions as its saving grace. It's a colossal disappointment in every other way and I'm clearly not the only one who holds this opinion: the movie performed abysmally at the box office. With a break-even point of $750 million, the film couldn't even muster $230 million in the United States and barely passed $650 million worldwide. This not only makes it the lowest grossing movie in the DC Comics' interconnected movie universe, but also a pale shadow of the success Marvel has managed to achieve. For comparison, Marvel's first team-up film, The Avengers, took the world by storm and ended up with $623 million in the United States and over $1.5 billion worldwide. Yes, Justice League quite literally made just a tad more worldwide than The Avengers did in the United States alone.<br/><br/>These numbers prove just how poorly this film and most of the DC universe has been handled so far. DC and Warner Bros. will need to seriously contemplate how to best move forward after this disaster because they quite literally cannot afford another misstep."
"mertafor","6","1","2","11 February 2018"," Budget is not everything
","Watching DC movies released after Dark Knight trilogy is a huge pain. Somehow every time they achieve to make most miserable super hero movies. In fact there are many aspects to talk about why this one fails but definitely horrible CGI stands out. It is so bad I felt like watching a b-type movie and Van Damme or Chuck Norris might come out to screen in any second. Zack Snyder still lives in the era of 300 where heavy visual effects makes you believe that it's a video game rather than a movie. I won't even talk about lack of character backgrounds, boring script and bad editing. Those have already become common failures of DC movies.<br/><br/>Even though I don't like to compare Marvel and DC yet I can't help myself. Producers have the same budget with any other Marvel movie (around $300 million) and somehow they manage to make such bad movies. I guess Marvel has got the best crew on board and there is no talented artists left to DC. <br/><br/>Justice league is a movie about having good team to overcome obstacles. But more than that it's about having a good team to make a good movie in the first place. No doubt that it's what's missing here."
"topher-61591","8","1","2","28 January 2018"," Huge Superman fan that was let down.
","While overall the movie was good, I was seriously irritated by the way the death of Superman was treated. It was one of the major things that has ever happened in the comic world and could of been a movie or two movies all by itself. Instead D.C. crammed it all in to about 15 min in two movies and treated it like it was no big deal."
"bornhard","7","1","2","27 January 2018"," Main Reason it didn't do well was because DVD quality print released illegally a day after movies Premiere all over Internet.
","I am sure most of you have seen the Korean subtitled DVD quality Pirated version with even the clips from the same print all over Youtube for many weeks now. Now usually when a big movie is released the pirated versions that are released online are bad quality usually recorded by camcorders etc. but this was illegally released clean quality which shouldn't have been out till February or March. So most people didn't have reason to go cinema when they could watch good quality print Online. How or who managed to do it is anybody's guess because it is something unheard of this is 1st time I saw a clean pirated print of a Blockbuster 2 days after its premiere released on internet.
 As for actual movie not really that bad it started beautifully, aftermath of Superman's death, his return and his whole presentation was awesome totally something to geek about probably my favorite part of movie. Aquaman was awesome maybe the best casting choice of all Characters, Jason Mamoa looked totally kickass, truly like Kingof Oceans should along with Amber Heard as beautiful Mera, would love to see their own movie. Flash and Cyborg did the Job nothing much to write home about but nothing negative either. Now Amazons and Wonderwoman , though all other Amazons looked awesome in cosmetic sense the way one would visualize I didn't understand why Hipolyta had a Russian accent. Gal Gadot has gained some weight to look more the part and she acted really well but here I do agree with most critics she was too skinny for the even the her exotic looks fits the role. 
 But still the worst part of the movie was Steppenwolf not the character itself but because it was made completely out using CGI, when they should have used only Partial CGI. Now it is understandable CGI is required to present an Imposing God Like being but they should have used partial CGI like Marvel did with Thanos because of which Steppenwolf ended up being worst part of the movie, it made the movie look cheesy and cheaply made. I sure hope they don't make same mistake with Darkseid in upcoming sequel. Anyway for actual geeks and fans its still worth a watch at least once no matter what whiners say, who probably watched the moved online."
"HaNzz99","8","1","2","26 January 2018"," Not perfect, but still a great time
","I liked Justice League. Some may still be sorry Snyder's cut won't be seen anytime soon, but I think most of his ideas did end up in the final product, along with some tweaks to make the film a little more accessible to general audiences. I don't necessarily agree with some of those choices but I understand why the folks at WB did what they did. For all the drama surrounding the film's production, it ended up feeling surprisingly very consistent in tone, well-paced and structured. It felt like a standalone movie that wasn't concerned with setting up future installments except through some very subtle easter eggs, unlike other films like Age of Ultron or BvS for instance (even the UC, which I loved).<br/><br/>Cyborg, Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman were the best characters since they got the better arcs. Cyborg's was surprisingly touching and the Trinity's were already set up in the previous films, so here we do get a sense of completion for their characters. <br/><br/>Aquaman felt a little sidelined, but what we did get to see from him left me excited for his solo movie. Flash was the comic relief character and, as such, stole the show every time he was on screen. He wasn't as fleshed out nor as developed as one would've hoped, but he still delivered. <br/><br/>Steppenwolf as the villain is nothing special. He's basically a less intimidating, interesting, and compelling General Zod that's 100% CGI and wanted to take over the world because that's what he does. He wasn't terrible, and had some standout moments and lines. He was just serviceable to the story and nothing else. <br/><br/>Cinematography and action choreography are still on par woth what we've come to expect from a visual director like Snyder, which is a good thing. Elfman's score was mixed. There are some tracks I loved and others I can't remember anymore. His decision to reuse some of the classic themes for Batman, Flash and Superman in a Justice League movie felt like a nice way of tributing superhero movies of old, but at the same time it felt out of place, given that those scores suit different interpretations of the characters we're currently seeing. The CGI can also be unexcusably bad, but there are other times where it would just look beautiful. As with every DCEU film before it, there's a lot of memorable shots and scenes to take away from JL, and the joy I felt as a fan for finally seeing these icons share the screen together for the first time in live action is just priceless. <br/><br/>Even with some technical issues, though, and its short runntime, JL still delivered on what it was supposed to do. It was an entertaining and heroic superhero film that introduces new likeable characters, brings some completion to the previous installments in a satisfactory manner, and opens the door for an exciting and promising future for the DC universe. A fun time at the movies."

Let's take it from the start :
The story is not good, it feels like it was inspired by the first Thor movie, Avengers and a couple of other Marvel flicks. And it was executed BADly. The jokes were not funny at all, it felt like they tried too hard to be funny.
Acting was not up to par either.
It felt like a rush project where they used talented actors ( apart from Ezra Miller who sucked and child murderer Gal Gadot ) in roles that didn't have any soul.

"jtindahouse","4","1","2","25 December 2017"," We may never get a good Batman movie again unfortunately
","I always knew going into 'Justice League' that I was going to have problems with it. Why? Because the concept itself is flawed. The basic premise is that almost none of these characters (other than Batman of course) are strong enough to justify their own movie, however all put into one movie they should be fine. Only that doesn't really stand to reason. All that means is that we are getting less screen time for the characters that actually deserve it.<br/><br/>'Justice League' has a ridiculously weak villain. 'Steppenwolf' couldn't be more boring or one-dimensional. The villain needs to be the strongest part in a film like this otherwise everything just feels completely pointless. Like what are they really fighting against? Nothing feels menacing or genuinely threatening. None of the main heroes had to sacrifice anything in order to conquer evil. Compare that to 'The Dark Knight' where the Joker literally pushed Batman to the edge in every way. Batman lost everything in order to save the day. What an incredible film that was. Compare that to 'Justice League' and you'll realise just how bad this film really was.<br/><br/>The only real bright spot I could see was the character of 'Barry Allen'. He kept me laughing and nailed it with almost every one-liner he had. Having said that I didn't come to this film looking for a laugh. So while it was a nice bonus, it really doesn't help the quality of the film very much. The one-liners by the other characters were particularly weak I thought. Some very lazy efforts by the writing staff. <br/><br/>Sadly, I fear the days of good Batman films like 'The Dark Knight' trilogy may be done and gone. They seem to have gone in an entirely new direction with the characters and that is very disappointing to see, because it is the wrong direction plain and simple."

I don't wan't to go graphic, but I'm just not strong enough to resist:until now, my most uncomfortable experience was when I had my first Erectile Dysfunction...but this movie has changed everything. 
Make yourself a favour and watch it, I know it's going to be a roller coaster of ""Whether am I still a human? Is there a point to life? Why should I keep this going when a litre of bleach is a dollar, and could end this all?"" and whatnot kind of feelings, but!!...if you can sit this through, you are going to be a whole new person, and even if you killed a prostitute at one point of your life (I hope you didn't though) you'll be able to forgive yourself.

How can we destroy every possible sense the audience might experience in one big finale. <br/><br/>Not just destroying the story itself, but also destroying every possible idea one might have about what a story can represent. A story can represent humour, it can represent the fight between good and evil, it can represent fear, it can represent hope.

Now we jump to Justice League where batman seems to have aged tremendously and is now incapable of taking a beating. On top of that, they made a complete mockery out of him. While all the others show up to fight Superman when he wakes up, it takes Batman a year to join the fight because he's ""Human."" And his only super power is that he is rich.<br/><br/>Now we jump to Wonder Woman. In BvS, she turned the tide in the fight against Doomsday. In fact, they wouldn't have been able to defeat him without her. So why she became weak in JL is beyond me. None of her hits on Steppenwolf did any damage. And it seemed as though she was more focused on being a counselor than a fighter.<br/><br/>I am not a Flash fan but I know that he is not afraid of bugs...<br/><br/>Aquama's character had no depth and could not fight.<br/><br/>Last but not least Superman... Henry Cavill's acting is atrocious! Instead of spending millions to CGI his beard and mustache out, they should have put that money toward acting lessons. The only reason he seemed to act better in Man of Steel is because he didn't have many lines. And I thought this movie was called Justice League, not Superman can do it alone. How is it that Steppenwolf is so powerful but Superman comes in and man handles him the entire time? They honestly didn't need Wonder woman, Batman or Aquaman. The Flash helped the hostages, Cyborg deactivated the mother boxes and Superman had Steppenwolf under control.<br/><br/>The only positive part of JL was Cyborg.

","Honestly after BVS and Fantastic Four, and after the decent work that was Wonder Women I never thought that DC would make another terrible job. I'll say is not worst than BVS or Fantastic Four, but it's still horrible. The plot is absolutely confusing, filled with plot holes, horribly development and unidimensional characters and Deus Ex Machinas.<br/><br/>The history is very generic, which is becoming a common problem in Superhero movies, and something I don't expect coming from the producers of ""The Dark Knight"";""Batman-The Beginning"";""Watchmen"", and the movies of Superman, because ""Man of Steel"" was decent and he is known for being a unidimensional hero. But the history is just a group of heroes that decide to make a group to defeat a very powerful villain. I mean for GOD SAKE EVEN THE JUSTICE LEAGUE CARTOON CAN MAKE BETTER. And the history itself it's full of conveniences.<br/><br/>The characters are a huge flaw in the movie, they are very predictable have a very poor development and boring dialogues. Batman turned into a unidimensional and boring character and he is my favorite character. Flash was OK, Wonderman was OK as well, but Cyborg is bland, boring and very poorly executed. Flash as well, but he is a comedy character.<br/><br/>The villain is probably the worst thing in the movie, he is just a Deus Ex Machina with a poor motivation and generic as well. Just wants the power to destroy the world. He is another unidimensional cliché villain with a mediocre construction, stupid motivation. And with dialogues that look a monologue. They need to understand that very powerful villain don't make the public scared. A good villain is like Joker from ""The Dark Knight"", he scares the public because he is realistic, and a villain like him could exist in real life and that's scary.<br/><br/>The movie itself is very predictable, with a lack of intensity and danger. And also boring, and not very exciting even with the battles.<br/><br/>The comedy didn't work, but I will give credit to the movie, there were some funny moments, but most of them it was not. Just a failed attempt to be funny.<br/><br/>The CGI and VFX were pure cancer. So artificial and exaggerated, that makes me wanna vomit.<br/><br/>But the best part of the movie is the battles, they are well choreographed, entertaining and sometimes funny. Of course, they are generic as well, but it didn't mess up a lot. At least for me. <br/><br/>*You can have little spoilers now. Be careful.<br/><br/>The acting was decent, with Henry Cavill being the best among them. And Superman was the high note of the movie for me, he actually looked ""human"" and Henry Cavill made the perfect acting for me. But it's ""Superman"" so of course he has minor flaws. Gal Datot is still a medium actor, Ben Affleck did a good job, so as Ezra Miller and Ray Fisher. The secondary actors did a good job as well.<br/><br/>The plot-twists like Superman resurrection are obvious and Cyborg power and his story are very loose.<br/><br/>There's no explication of how can Cyborg absorb the energy.<br/><br/>And why he has similar power to Steppenwolf.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was a DC attempt to copy Marvel but failed. The movie is really generic; poorly executed, horrible CGI, VFX, and scenarios; stupid comedy; horribly develop characters with a horrible villain.<br/><br/>Final Score: 3/10"

","""Justice League"" is a slam-bang, smash-up saga, but it doesn't surpass last year's ""Batman Vs Superman: Dawn of Justice."" Mind you, as entertaining as ""Justice League"" is, it isn't as exhilarating as Marvel's most recent ""Thor: Ragnarok."" At this point, the cliché about apples and oranges crop up. The DC Cinematic Universe differs from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Nevertheless, despite their intrinsic differences, comparisons are inevitable. I grew up reading DC Comics and preferred them over Marvel Comics. Unfortunately, Warner Brothers hasn't scored the same critical and commercial success that New Line Cinema, Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, and Walt Disney have with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ironically, Warner Brothers made history when it released the first ""Batman"" (1989) with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, but the esteemed studio—Warner Brothers introduced sound movies--hasn't maintained the consistency and charisma that distinguishes the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>For the record, the first Marvel property to illuminate the silver screen was ""Captain America"" (1944), but it was a 15-chapter, black & white, Saturday afternoon, Republic Studios serial. DC Comics still beat its competitor to the screen with Columbia's release of the 15-chapter ""Batman"" serial in 1943 and followed it up with a 1949 serial sequel. Later, these serials inspired Twentieth Century Fox's live-action ""Batman"" television series, co-starring Adam West & Burt Ward, that aired from 1966 to 1968. Initially, the Marvel Cinematic Universe stumbled at the get-go with ""Howard the Duck"" (1986) as well as the straight-to-video versions of ""The Punisher"" (1989) and ""Captain America"" (1990). New Line Cinema's ""Blade"" (1998), Twentieth Century Fox's ""X-Men"" (2000), and Columbia's ""Spider-Man"" (2000) struck pay-dirt on the big-screen. Disney has since appropriated the MCU from Paramount Pictures, and they have made it a cornerstone of their studio. Ultimately, the DC Cinematic Universe doesn't have anybody like Stan Lee, the venerable Marvel Comics' publisher and chairman who everybody recognizes and adores with his cameo appearance. Moreover, Warner's has not been able to duplicate its stunning back-to-back success with ""Batman V Superman"" and ""Wonder Woman."" The biggest problems facing ""Justice League"" are its $300-million price tag and its $150-million advertising campaign. Meaning, just because ""Justice League"" is a good movie, doesn't mean that it will triple its investment like ""Batman V Superman"" and ""Wonder Woman."" ""Suicide Squad"" was no slouch either with worldwide receipts amounting to over $745-million.<br/><br/>Meantime, any movie that resurrects the Last Son of Krypton can't be all bad. ""Watchman"" director Zack Snyder and scenarists Chris Terrio of ""Batman Vs Superman"" and Joss Whedon of ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" have not only brought Superman back from the grave, but they have also ushered the Flash/Barry Allen, Aquaman/Arthur Curry, and Cyborg/Victor Stone into the fray. Some may be disappointed to learn that this Flash (Ezra Miller) isn't the same Flash (Grant Gustin) in the WB's television series. Furthermore, Snyder and company shun frivolous romantic subplots since they have more than enough to keep them busy with the newest superheroes. Clocking in at two high-octane hours, ""Justice League"" doesn't dawdle Surprisingly, even with Joss Whedon aboard, ""Justice League"" qualifies as strictly by-the-numbers with few surprises. The first third dispatches Bruce Wayne (former ""Daredevil"" Ben Affleck) to recruit Barry Allen, Arthur Curry, and Victor Stone because an intimidating the ancient extraterrestrial villain threatening Earth—Steppenwolf (voice of Ciarán Hinds)—is more than the Dark Knight can handle. Says Wayne to Aquaman, ""I believe that an enemy is coming from far away. I'm looking for warriors. I'm building an alliance to defend us."" Steppenwolf looks and sounds sufficiently malevolent. This wicked superhuman warrior wields a nasty electro-axe and invades Earth with an army of google-eyed airborne predators called Parademons. Before he sets off in search of the new superheroes, Bruce Wayne reacquaints himself with Diana Prince (Gal Gadot of ""Wonder Woman""). She sneaks into his ultra-security equipped Bat Cave without tripping off any alarms. Reluctantly, Allen, Curry, and Stone agree to join up, but Aquaman/Arthur Curry isn't impressed initially with Bruce Wayne. ""What's your super power,"" the oceanic warrior asks. ""I'm rich,"" replies Wayne.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Thor: Ragnarok,"" ""Justice League"" confines its humor to clever dialogue quips. At one point, Alfred Pennyworth (Oscar-winner Jeremy Irons of ""Reversal of Fortune"") remarks to Wayne, ""I miss the days when one's biggest concern is exploding wind-up penguins."" This doesn't keep the Flash from enlivening the action with his fleet-footed frolics. Ultimately, once the Justice League has assembled, and Steppenwolf has uttered his ultimatum, the second third ensues with the resurrection of Superman (Henry Cavill of ""Man of Steel""), but he isn't particularly pleased with the Caped Crusader and what happened in ""Batman Vs Superman."" Wayne keeps a secret weapon in his arsenal to lure Kal-El back into the fold. Unless you've skipped Superman's earlier exploits in ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman Vs Superman,"" you should be able to guess what Batman has that can change Superman's mind. Death hasn't been too traumatic for Clark Kent. He has managed to preserve his magnificently muscled physique along with his incandescent laser-beam eyes. The final third pits the League against Steppenwolf, and this obnoxious hellion doesn't go quietly into that good night. Of course, you know that the Justice League will thwart Steppenwolf, but he doesn't go down with a fight.<br/><br/>The biggest letdown about ""Justice League"" are the segments that introduce the various superheroes. Surely, Snyder and his writers, particularly Joss Whedon, could have conjured up something more exciting and less generic. The confrontation between Wonder Woman and a criminal gang planning to plunge the world back into the Stone Age lacks the ""wow"" factor. The same goes for the other superheroes. Batman unveils some impressive gadgets, namely 'the nightcrawler.' Snyder relies again on CGI galore, as he did in ""Batman Vs Superman,"" but this is not surprising considering it depicts larger-than-life heroes and villains who perform the impossible. Altogether, despite its predictable plotting, ""Justice League"" delivers action aplenty and doesn't wear out its welcome."

","Justice League is a step in the right direction for the DC cinematic universe, however, the film is held back by its awkward pacing and vast amount of cut content. I look forward to viewing the directors cut to see the complete rendition of this film not one that has been sadly cut back by WB. Ezra Millers rendition of Barry Allen is fresh and exciting. Jason Momoa's Aquaman is fantastic but needed more screen time and Ray Fisher provided an interesting and likable darker take on Teen Titan favorite Cyborg. The rest of the cast returns in all their glory with Gal Gadot's wonder woman again being a stand out performance. In the end the team is formed and they have a great group dynamic however with a lack of character set up through prior films some of the characters developments are thin and need further developments. Where this movie shines is in its flash back sequences where we get a glimpse of a green lantern and a battle between the Amazons/ Atlantians and Steepenwolf. The villain is overpowered appropriately in these sequences, but is weak throughout the rest of the film. Overall Justice League is a step up from its previous counterparts, there is still some further development to be made in order for this franchise to reach the glory is deserves."

","With the direction of the film being fumbled and script rewrites lacking cohesion; 'Justice League' pieced together a mess and made it into a watchable story.<br/><br/>What would have been a better plot? Get rid of Steppenwolf, introduce a resurrected Superman as Darkseid's new General. It would have brought back Superman without rushing the lazy plot device used in Justice League. Instead of battling a poor CGI of Steppenwolf, Batman's team could fight a helmeted stranger whose powers reveal (to great surprise) that it's actually Superman. Hell, it's happened before in the comics and the toons.<br/><br/>Get rid of the motherbox thing. A motherbox in the comics is just a transportation device. It's basically like someone gave up on writing something worthy of a 'Justice League' movie, and flipped a coin on how to unite the team. The biggest goof in 'Justice League' is that the boxes activated when Superman died - But no they didn't - Cyborg came to be because of an activated motherbox in the previous movie. Did they really just ignore that? Secondly - Batman seemed incredibly pessimistic about not only his ability, but the ability of Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg & The Flash to defeat Steppenwolf. That isn't Batman. Batman would have calculated a dozen different scenarios to win this fight. I've never known him to feel so helpless that he would imagine such a laughable idea as to activate one of the very motherboxes they were trying to keep away from the bad guy. So just remove them all together.<br/><br/>Introduce Darkseid. Why didn't they do this in the first place? I thought we sat through the crap-fest of 'Batman VS Superman' because it was leading to a Darkseid visit. Wasn't that the reasoning behind Batman's sudden psychic nightmares? In a version with Superman as the villain, he could have been brought back to his sense in the same way it happened in this film, but with the added bonus of - It doesn't matter because Darkseid is here.<br/><br/>How difficult is it to write a workable superhero movie?

Dc has it's own superheroes as does Marvel..<br/><br/>JLA has been one of the most anticipated multi hero movie from DC ....does it live up to the expectations????<br/><br/>Let's see...Read on.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes is Paisa wasool (as termed in Indian words) meaning..worth the movie ticket price...Wonder Woman and Amazonians are characterized to perfection...Just Amazing..... ..This movie displays the Prowess of the Amazonian and shows us why she is called the Wonderwoman... ... The other characters of Aquaman and Flash are also perfectly characterized as per the comics stories..... Flash was aptly used in the movie. Aquaman—read below. Cyborg....was OK and not a let-down.... And Batman....not a huge fan of Ben Affleck as Batman..but his role is OK for this movie .. For the movie...the whole concept was about forming the JLA team..And that is how it should be treated... Bit of chuckling humor....and a bit of sentiment...all timely placed.. ....all good.. . Those were the pros<br/><br/>Now for the cons... Story....weak and doesn't do justice to the proceedings.<br/><br/>The power of Aquaman was underutilized... With super heroes...We need super villain..it is actually the villain who intensifies the movies.....and the villain .stephenwolf is introduced(the names doesn't really gives any goose bumps)..... They build up his entry as a super villain who was hard to defeat even by tram of super heroes...for he fights all heroes, Amazonians, Gods, Atlantians...green lanterns..and so on in flash back..but that he is beaten by JLA without as much effort does not glorify him as super villain. What am I saying then? Well...I grew up reading these super heroes comics since childhood from late 70s and 80s, so I precisely know what these characters are. And to watch them on screen is just amazing...few whistle blowing moments...( I wished I could whistle.many in the theater whistled though.)<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie despite its shortcomings... Spoiler—or not.. And of course Superman....Yes....not a really a spoiler for me because there is no JLA without Superman... Finally and I really say finally..They show Superman as to why he called the greatest super hero in DC comics.... And in the end all it took to defeat the Super villain was --- Superman.So this doesn't entirely justify whole of JLA fighting the villain.<br/><br/>If you like the DC super heroes...go watch it and pay no heed to any reviews.<br/><br/>Worth a watch..and watch it in Imax.. .. If I get a chance I would watch it again.."
"srdjan_veljkovic","6","1","2","18 November 2017"," Public apology for BvS delivers a plain superhero multi-origin story
","It's like they wanted to apologize for all the things that were attacked in Batman vs Superman - too long of a movie, too much short & jumping-around scenes, too dark of a tone, too little Wonder Woman, superheroes fighting each other instead of super-villains... FWIW, I never thought these things needed an apology. It was a different take on the superhero movie. Sure, it didn't work out very well, but, it was at least interesting.<br/><br/>JL is not very interesting. It comes down to a multi-origin story for the 3 new superheroes, an extended Superman cameo and a very shallow continuation of Batman and WW story. It has quite a bit of humor, but it comes down to one-liners and short gags. There's only one or two exceptions, like the Aquaman monologue near the end. All the origin stories are simple and not interesting.<br/><br/>The forced shift from Batman to WW also does not work. This should be a Batman-centric story, he's using all he's got (or has left) to bring this team together, facing his mid-life crisis of sorts. Forcing WW as his ""founding partner"", because: feminism, doesn't work. Also, Batman- WW dynamic is weird. There are hints of him liking her, and hints of her soft spot for heroic men, yet it's very shallow and doesn't play well with other parts where it's more of a big brother - little sister kind of dynamic.<br/><br/>Add to the fact that Gal Gadot still doesn't fit that silly costume very well (can we have her back in the dress from BvS, please) and she's wearing it, like, all the time, the fact that all you need to revive Superman is a lot of voltage and that there's no obvious benefit from the League teaming up against Steppenwolf (why don't just let Superman deal with him), and you've got a story that feels pointless and aimless. About the only thing that would make sense is that it's setting up a DC Universe in which Batman will step back to just provide the money, WW would lead and everybody else better listen. But, we already have the WW movies for this kind of feminism/misandry trips.<br/><br/>And, yeah... don't listen to some silly comments about this movie. Very few Amazonians have bare midriffs, most wear full armor. Then they are surprised by Steppenwolf and go into battle as-is. So, they don't _choose_ to go to battle w/bare midriffs. Also, come on, this is all silly and make-believe, there's nothing real about Amazonians and thus there's nothing real about their armor or combat tactics. Not to mention that they're in Greece, so, you either go w/bare midriff or a lot of sweating.<br/><br/>A few brights spots are Amy Adam's performance and the plethora of Flash jokes and gags. Everything else is pretty plain.<br/><br/>Having said all that, as a way to pass the time with a few good jokes and simple story about some well-known superheroes, it's OK."
"lucho_mj-663-40248","6","1","2","18 November 2017"," A truly faithful Superhero Movie!
","It's a great change in the light tone of the DCEU from what we saw in BvS, although I loved the last one, with the complex story and the darker background. The movie works because it's a simple story, very entertaining, with lots of action, humor and epic stills. Batman IS Batman. Ben Affleck and Zack Snyder give us the definitive version of the Comic Character into the big screen. Again Gal Gadot is brilliant on Wonder Woman, Jason Momoa is a great badass Aquaman, Ray Fisher is an excellent Cyborg (important in the story.. he's the key of everything that happens, including the resurrection of Superman).. Ezra Miller is a correct Flash (all Speedforce scenes are awesome) and Henry Cavill is the best Superman all fans could ask since Reeve's.<br/><br/>Some failure points in the movie are not only the reshots were everybody notice the digitally erased moustache of Henry Cavill (in times of the reshots he was filming Mission Impossible 6 and by signed contract he cannot shave it).. his mouth looks strange in most of Cavill's apparitions. That's why you can notice that all Superman scenes are Wheedon's reshots.<br/><br/>Another failure is most of CGI. For a U$s 300 million budget movie, It's sounds strange, but seems a lot of Computer Images that we've seen in 2002 Spiderman movie (Sam Raimi). Danny Elfman's score is correct with lot of easter eggs including his own version of Tim Burton's Batman, Hans Zimmer's Wonder Woman theme and John William's classic Superman hit. I love Danny Elfman. But in this universe I think the epic score made by Hans Zimmer (retired from Superhero movies after BvS) and Junkie XL would make it better in some point.<br/><br/>The most important subject of the film was Superman's resurrection. It think in the context of the film is correct. Helmed by the Justice League. With a Superman coming back from the dead with the kryptonian technology combined with Cyborg and the Mother Box, he returns confused and fights against the League until Lois appears. I was dreaming of a Superman returning with the comics black suit. I thought this was going to happen but finally didn't.<br/><br/>I think this version of the film is not Snyder's first cut, and the resurrection was not originally like in this theatrical version. Although is his movie (80% filmed), his vision seems very far from Man of Steel and BvS, but it works. It's a Fan Service film with lot of DC references and the post credits scenes invites to expect everything that DCEU has to offer.<br/><br/>I was hoping that one of the two post credits scenes, make a reference to Darkseid, but they are correct so it was very enjoyable.<br/><br/>I give 8/10 and I'm hoping to see it again soon."
"jackson-regurge","6","1","2","18 November 2017"," More ordinary to balance out the extraordinary!
","Justice League sees some of the most iconic comic characters leap onto the screen in a dramatic fashion. The film features Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg who all bring their own individual motif. It is undeniable that the film is a visual spectacle and has some truly incredible special effects. For example, the scene in which Wonder Woman blocks bullets with her gauntlets. This is truly brilliant as it incorporates the comic book style onto the bring screen, which is enhanced by stunningly intricate costumes and well-fitting soundtrack. <br/><br/>My favourite parts of the film are the interactions between the members of the Justice League. For example, the scene when Bruce Wayne first meets Barry Allen. There is a good chemistry between all the actors in the film, but it is irrefutable that it is Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) who steals the show. <br/><br/>The film is fast paced but delivers a level of entertainment which is appealing. The film does have a few chinks in its armour, such as the muddled storytelling. You can tell that there was trouble directing and editing this movie. I also think that the villain wasn't very compelling, but it would be hard to match the boldness of the central characters. I think that, although slightly rushed at times, Justice League is still an impressive accomplishment that all those involved should be proud of. <br/><br/>Overall, I feel the film is entertaining, yet weak in parts. I feel that to improve it, the filmmakers should focus more on the ordinary to balance out the extraordinary. But the DCEU may be already taking a step in this direction as can be seen by the fantastic after credits sequence. I would also like to see Batman being more of a detective rather than just hanging around on the side-lines. I would give Justice League 7 out of 10 and would recommend it to anyone looking for good light-hearted comic book action."

Movie introduces too many things from all Mother Boxes to Steppenwolf, Atlantians, Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman. Due to so many introductions in single movie it is hard to get attach to every character in the movie.

"joshbarton15","4","1","2","18 November 2017"," Major step backwards after Wonder Woman
","Before Justice League, the DCEU took a number of films to finally find its feet with Wonder Woman, and when it finally did, there was hope that the future was bright for this cinematic universe. With Justice League, I can't help but feel they've taken a huge step backwards in terms of quality because this film is an utter mess.<br/><br/>After the death of Superman (Henry Cavill), Earth is seen as a defenceless and fearful target for Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds). With an attack imminent and a restored faith in humanity, Batman (Ben Affleck) enlists the help of other, more powerful beings; Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Flash (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), to fight to save the world. <br/><br/>Justice League very much feels like a film made by two directors with differing visions for the final product. Extensive reshoots and additional scenes were written and directed by Joss Whedon after Zack Snyder's departure from the project due to personal reasons. You can really tell which scenes have been added late on, making for a film that ultimately shifts away from the tone established by Snyder in Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. I don't want to bring up studio interference again when talking about a superhero film but this really does stink of it unfortunately.<br/><br/>This should feel like an event film but it just doesn't at all, which is really disappointing for me. The DCEU have blatantly rushed into Justice League and with a mere two hour runtime, they've crammed way too much into the plot. I get trying to streamline the film however, this is a case where the extra minutes are needed to allow the film to breathe.<br/><br/>It's an unusual beast though this film as it feels like way too much going on in such a short space of time but it does certainly have it's entertaining moments, mainly when the team are together. There's a few decent action sequences, the finale sadly being just an overblown mess of CGI, and some of the characters really get their chance to shine but it's nowhere near as epic as it probably should and could have been.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Justice League features a dynamic between the team that mostly works but also feels incredibly forced at times. The best thing about the film is easily Ezra Miller's performance as Barry Allen/Flash, Miller nailing the giddiness and unheroic nervousness perfectly, and he steals the whole film from all the other heroes. Look out for a hilarious first meeting between Flash and Superman which had the audience in stitches.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot don't perform as well as they have in these roles before, which I felt might be down to the jarring shift in tone that doesn't serve them so well. Jason Momoa and Ray Fisher are served better by the film's tone however, Fisher falls into the background even when it feels like they're really trying to give him something to do.<br/><br/>I had such high hopes for Superman in Justice League, particularly the moment of his return, but I can't help but feel let down by the result. Henry Cavill certainly deserves better than this, his lines being so awful and the CGI cover-up of his moustache being one of the most distracting things I've ever seen in a film. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, weak villains are a bit too common in superhero films these days and Steppenwolf, played by Ciaran Hinds, is arguably one of the worst of all time. Not only a giant CGI atrocity, Steppenwolf doesn't really feel like much of a threat at all, which is bizarre seeing as he's supposed to challenge the team. <br/><br/>Justice League is thankfully better than Suicide Squad however, when you stand it up against something like Wonder Woman, it goes down like a lead balloon. It's almost as if there's a lack of respect from the studio towards one of the great superhero teams of comic-book history."
"nealzofficial","7","1","2","18 November 2017"," The Greedy Piglet
","Let's get something straight, the main goal of Warner Bros is not to make a good film, all they want is commercial success. Because of this precise reason all DC films can ever be is ""above average,"" not excellent. <br/><br/>Now, personally I enjoyed Justice League, I had very low expectations while going in but the film out to be much better than I expected. The entertainment factor was there, the action was thrilling, the humor worked most of the time. Overall, I found it to be an above average film and a decent effort. If only, the studio was brave enough to adapt some of the better story lines from the comics, this film could have been so much more. Marvel is not known for their phenomenal plots, they focus on entertainment and its clear that Warner Bros is trying to jump on that bandwagon with Justice League. <br/><br/>For the future we can hope that Warner Bros come to their senses and retain some originality by focusing on good story lines and character development. But for the greedy piglet the future looks bleak."
"yingsin_c","7","1","2","17 November 2017"," Better direction for DCEU with Justice League
","Honestly, being a fan of the DCAU and after watching Justice League the first time around (yes I watched it twice so far), I was torn between liking the movie or not. The choice was between re-watching JL War instead of the movie a second time round. In a way, I appreciated the movie better afterwards, but was also bugged by the inconsistencies in the plot as well. To start off with what I did not like (spoilers ahead), the parademons - the movie started with introducing them as creatures that fed on fear as well as ones whom transformed from the defeated enemies of war. There was no way any unarmed civilians can survive an encounter and the number of parademons should had increased immensely with every scene. The movie tried to move the audience with the focus on 1 Russian family, who were paralyzed with fear, nothing apart from Hollywood magic could have saved them. Especially, after seeing how quickly they turned on Steppenwolf. Next, there was an inconsistency in the battle scenes. The best action sequence was the one on Themyscira, unbelievable CGI aside, this was the only scene that was given enough time to show the length the Amazonians would go, to protect the motherbox. The Atlantians sequence saw maybe 3 whom tried to stop Steppenwolf, and we only saw a boomtube when the motherbox was taken from mankind. Movie screen time unfortunately, spent in prior scenes on rounding up Star Lab staff for questioning. Now, on the commendable side, I liked how the female characters were the heart and soul of the team as well as the movie, while the male counterparts brought the muscle and charm. Flash was relatable and lovable, Aquaman was a towering presence of cool, Cyborg was slowly embracing what he is. On to the DC Trinity, Superman as the muscle, Wonder Woman as the heart and Batman as the brain of the team. The movie version chose an older version of Batman, a little battle weary, and undoubtedly convinced that he was not enough to fight against the invasion. His singular focus was to improve the chances of mission success, even if it meant sacrificing himself. Overall, the theme of the movie is that everyone recognises their flaws, and finding their feet (pun intended) as well as place in the team. With the calibre of the actors attached to DCEU, may the big round table with 6 chairs, but with room for more, be filled."

"zaidmnomani","2","3","12","22 April 2020"," The Worst Possible Way to Spend Three Hundred Million Dollars.
","This movie is one of the worst big budget films I have ever seen. This film fails both as a Justice League story and as a film itself. Every single aspect of this film ranges from substandard to absolute garbage.<br/><br/>Let's start with the most important aspect that all movies should be stellar at. The main characters. If the main characters are not interesting, then people will not like your film. Plain and simple. Apparently the writers behind Justice League clearly did not know nor care about this. Lets start with Batman.<br/><br/>Batman in this film is completely useless. While everyone else in the film is some sort of super-powered alien or hero who can do all sorts of crazy things, Batman is just a human. His main part to play in the film is to bring the Justice League together, but after he does that he sort of hangs around in the background shooting a bunch of PS 2 aliens ( with a gun?). A clever writer would have found a way of keeping Batman in the story in some creative way, but this is the same person who wrote BvS and The Rise of Skywalker, so I'm not to surprised. Also, despite being a cold blooded killer in the previous movie, now he's just a rich guy who cracks jokes. It's like they were trying to make him similar to Iron Man, except it does not fit well with what we have been shown before.<br/><br/>Wonder Women is extremely boring in this film. She does absolutely nothing but punch and pose most of the time, and this is not helped by the fact that Gal Godot is not a good actress. Her character has no flaws, no character arc, no problems, nothing at all that could make her somewhat interesting. She's just there.<br/><br/>Aquaman is another character who does absolutely nothing in this film (Noticing a pattern?). His character can only be described as 'cool guy who shouts a lot'. Other than that, he just punches aliens and throws his trident occasionally. Not much to say there.<br/><br/>The Flash in this movie is the worst depiction of the character I have seen in any form of media. They basically turned him into a discount Spider-Man. I think he is supposed to be the comedy relief of the film, except that pretty much everyone is making jokes all the time. They tried to make a father/son relationship with him and Batman, but like everything else in the film, it comes of as forced and annoying.<br/><br/>Cyborg is another character who is shoved to the side for most of the runtime. I get it, it's pretty hard to give every character a lot of screen time when you have a main cast of six characters. The thing is though, Cyborg is the only character in the entire movie who has somewhat of an arc. His thing is that he used to be a human but an accident destroyed his body so now he is 95% robot. It is not the most engaging of character arcs, and it's pretty cliche, but I guess it's better than nothing. The problem is, his arc is pretty much forgotten about half way through the film. Maybe the studio simply cut out all his scenes because they were desperate to make sure the film's length was under 2 hours, I don't know.<br/><br/>Superman comes back from the dead in the stupidest, most idiotic way possible. And instead of actually doing something captivating with his resurrection, he wakes up confused for a while and then just becomes a hero again. So much wasted potential. Also the terrible CGI mustache does not make things any better.<br/><br/>Steppenwolfe is the main villain of the film, and they could not have made a more bland, generic, forgettable villain. His motivation, plan, goals, none of it makes any sense whatsoever. And his terrible design feels, like many have said, something straight out of a video game from fifteen years ago.<br/><br/>The fact that Henry Cavil's mustache is not the worst special effect in the film just goes to show how truly horrendous the CGI is. Everything is over saturated, like a Micheal Bay film. The acting is really dull, you can tell most of the actors were really bored. The only redeemable thing about the film is that it's really funny in a so bad it's good way. But good Lord, what an absolute waste of money."
"Timbo_Watching","3","3","12","18 April 2020"," A big mistake..
","This film was a very big mistake.
There was little to no plot, a very bland villain who had a nice entry but then just disappeared quickly, after only having seen little of him. It hardly felt like a superheroes versus villain film because of this.
The writing was horrible, so even the cast couldn't save this disaster.
Also, a budget of $300M?? The CGI was really bad at times, especially for a film at that time. What did they spend so much money on? Nothing in this film was special or nice.. did they spend this all on drugs or something hence the film is such a joke? That would be my only logical explanation... this just wasn't it.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time on it. I honestly don't even know how I sat through the entirety of the film, although I did not have full attention through most it."

","...and all I come up with is fine. Serviceable. Good enough.<br/><br/>An okay story that reinforces the idea that while paying lip service to teamwork is all well and good, if you live in the DC universe it is not especially relevant without a certain individual in tights and a red cape.<br/><br/>Gadot gives an excellent performance reprising WW. I actually rather like Affleck's aging Batman. Momoa makes for an imposing action hero, though under utilized in this film. Miller does okay in this incarnation of the Flash, but I don't like Flash as a scared kid. Fisher is reasonably solid as Cyborg.<br/><br/>For me the CGI didn't take over.<br/><br/>Directing was spotty, but the pace was decent.<br/><br/>Dialogue was spotty as well, but the actors had decent chemistry.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>Much better than most entries into the DCU, but not up to the high standard set by Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>It's watchable...might suggest waiting til it hits Netflix or Amazon though."

","A true comic book movie, Justice League showcases jaw-dropping action, breathtaking visuals, & great chemistry uniting the original and most storied superhero team to EPIC results. 8.7/10.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Justice League. Superman. Batman. Wonder Woman. The Flash. Green Lantern. Aquaman. Cyborg. When they first premiered way back in 1960, DC Comics' Justice League rocked the world by combining the original and most iconic superheroes in unprecedented ways. The first superhero team ever (Justice League - 1960, Avengers - 1963), the Justice League dominated their way onto television screens, lunch boxes, and merchandising with massive, record sales. Fast-forward 57 years and we FINALLY get a huge blockbuster cinematic adaptation with the scope and scale that only mountains of money can buy. 2017's Justice League is a jaw-droppingly epic, visually breathtaking vision of superhero movies that leaves you smiling like you're 10 years old again watching the JL cartoon on a sugary cereal-filled Saturday morning.<br/><br/>Yes, it has flaws, but so does every Marvel movie that are completely overlooked by critics who prioritize ""fun"" (which JL is the definition of) but hate on DC for having when they TOLD them to lighten up from BvS' darkness & complexity. Impossible-to- please critics & people that seem determined to hate on DC no matter what. If you're a superhero fan or DC fan, there is NO WAY you won't love this movie! Guaranteed.<br/><br/>Pros: - JAW-DROPPING visuals and cinematography courtesy of Snyder's eye for breathtaking shots that truly make each frame feel like a comic book come to life, - Gets all of its heroes right - Ben Affleck cemented as best Batman, Gal Gadot as the sure-bet in Wonder Woman, Jason Momoa as the badass and brilliantly reinvented Aquaman, Ezra Miller as the quirky, humorous Flash, and Ray Fisher as the layered and deep Cyborg, - PHENOMENAL team chemistry and character interactions with the first 2/3 of the movie borderlining on perfect in its building, character vignettes, CGI in each's powers, and execution bringing them together well, - great action and fight scenes carefully constructed and epic to behold and satisfying Superman story (no spoiler) -Â great, breezy pacing that keeps you invested and on the edge of your seat the whole time - Danny Elfman scoring good (not Hans Zimmer but still) bringing classics like the '89 Batman score and '78 Superman score into the movie, -just the right amount and kind of humor - still serious and delivers more than enough action while also lightening the tone to feel like you're 10 years old again watching the Justice League cartoon on a sugary cereal-filled Saturday morning & correcting BvS' flaws, - tons of Easter Eggs & comic references that will leave any true superhero fan giddy with joy. Post-credit scene 2 extremely hype showing limitless potential for JL 2 & on<br/><br/>Cons: - CGI in the last 1/4 bad with red skies and purple alien tech mess & the mustache problem noticeable. Could've had better ending too with a shot of the League - Bizarre choice in villain in Steppenwolf (not bad but many better options) - Flash characterization as a basement loser with Power Ranger suit and blue (not yellow) lightning - still like Grant Gustin's Flash better too<br/><br/><ul><li>*SPOILER* -&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; No GL, missing a huge founding member of The League.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>feels a little too short with WB's weird decision to cut it to under 2 hours (needed 20 min or so more in the final act)</li></ul><br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Still can't lie and say that it wasn't one of the most fun times I've had at the movies and delivers everything you could want in a superhero movie.

The characters don't flow well together, Wonder Woman is always trying to pose because she is a model, Batman isn't even sticking around for another film, Superman wasn't even in the movie half the time, and he was already starting another role because he knew this one was going to be bad as they were doing re-shoots. The actor who played Cyborg had most of his parts cut and he thanked the director for cutting all of his parts because he knew they were so bad. Don't even get me started on the awful CG bad guy who doesn't do anything, and I don't even need to say anything else to explain my choice of stars. I would've given it a 0 if I could've."

The Flash was super annoying and just a downright joke. Wonderman was also nothing like she was in her solo film. Cyborg was just useless. I think honestly the only character who shined was Aquaman. He was excellent. The story arc was also very lazy and very scattered. This movie was just utter trash and is one score I actually agree with on Rotten Tomatoes.

Just to remove Cavill's upper lip facial hair. <br/><br/>About the movie I can be short: The attempt at humor was not very successful en acting was just above average.

This movie was my most anticipated movie of 2017 and I have waited for all the way from 2016. But as the rumors said, it was a huge disappointment. Nothing like Zack thingy was seen in the movie. No music, dialogues, seriousness, darkness, slow-motion action with Hanz Zimmer's synchronized music. In the BvS, Lex Luthor portrayed a very strong and tough villain but Steppen Wolf looked like a child especially after Superman makes an entry. Looked like he was a baby in front of Superman and he smashed him here and there. <br/><br/>The plot was juvenile, CGI was bad, many scenes shown in the trailers were missing. It's hard to think what will be the future of DCEU after this movie. I don't know why they compromised so much on the Quality given that their tough opponents like Marvel."

"namashi_1","3","2","7","18 November 2017"," Injustice.
","'Justice League' is the kind of a disappointment that hurts your gut. No jokes here, but this much-hyped Superhero Spectale lacks fizz. What's surprising is that this is an even weaker film to DC's very own & forgettable Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice. <br/><br/>'Justice League' Synopsis: Fueled by his restored faith in humanity and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists the help of his newfound ally, Diana Prince, to face an even greater threat. <br/><br/>The fundamental problem with 'Justice League' is it's poorly written Screenplay. While the first-hour is all about forming the league, with their back stories, the second-hour is an action mayhem. And very sadly enough, none of it really works. Barring a few funny one-liners & a set of spirited actors, there is nothing that stands out here. And Steppenwolf has to be THE weakest DC villain in a long time! So it's the Writing, that's clearly the culprit here! <br/><br/>Zack Synder's Direction underwhelms. Cinematography is of standard quality. Editing lacks sharpness. Art & Costime Design are brilliantly done. Action-Sequences are decent. Graphics are surprisingly tacky. The Score is alright. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Ben Affleck continues to be a tough Batman & impresses, but it's sad that his version of Batman is so underwritten. Gal Gadot is a firecracker as Wonder Woman. She looks absolutely ravishing too! Ezra Miller shines as The Flash, delivering a sporty performance. Jason Momoa too makes a mark as Aquaman. Ray Fisher as Cyborg is alright. Others lend ordinary support. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Justice League' is a poor show. A major disappointment!"
"timothyisathome","9","2","7","17 November 2017"," it was the movie DC needed it to be
","This is the best DC movie for quite a few years, I'd say since The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>The last few DC movies have been way to ""franchise"" oriented. In that I mean that they were to busy trying to set up movies that DC wants to make to bother being good self standing stories.<br/><br/>DC brought back some humor and did it without getting cheesy. This movie gave more character development than the last few DC movies and did it without drying out the movie. I was afraid this could have made the movie boring with so many new characters being introduced in one movie, but it went smoothly and I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>There were a couple cool twists and some very expected things throw at the audience. it was a good balance of having a red thread and throwing some curve balls into the movie. Since most of us know what ""should and shouldn't"" happen with the characters any large deviance from original characters would be met with anger if you like super hero movies you will enjoy this. if you don't well, you shouldn't have watched it just to whine about it afterwards."

","Expectations to set before watching: - It's a superhero action flick, do not expect a deep thought-provoking story or moving Oscar-worthy performances (the performances are actually good though) - It's the DCEU, so it's going to be a little rushed in terms of universe building, so just go in accepting the fact that you're meeting Flash, Cyborg & Aquaman for the first time and their characters will not be developed in an ideal way - There's a lot of CGI, but there's no other way to make a movie like this<br/><br/>Pros: + Excellent Visuals + Well choreographed action set pieces + Not too dark and mopy like MoS or BvS + Not a stand-up comedy show like Marvel either + Excellent performance by all actors (Henry Cavill actually smiles and laughs) + Far more streamlined storytelling than BvS + Villain (Steppenwolf) although generic, still feels menacing & intimidating + Aquaman is cool now + Cool post-credits scene (you must stay till the end)<br/><br/>Cons: - Generic Villain (Steppenwolf) who wants to destroy the world, not given enough screen time for character development (but that's the case with every comic movie villain except maybe Hela) - Generic story, feels oversimplified, as is again usual with comic book movies; but at least its coherent this time - WB restricted the runtime to 2 hrs so you can feel it jumping the narrative every now & then; could have felt more smooth with 15-20 extra mins of runtime - Not enough backstory for the 'Mother Boxes'; someone who is not familiar with the comics may struggle to understand them as the core plot devices"

","I haven't always been a fan of DC's superhero movies. They've been very uneven in my opinion and have lacked the fun and heart of some other franchises. They sometimes seemed to be more about big fights and ultra-serious dialogue than connecting with the audience on any level. With Justice League, DC finally really finds its heart and its sense of humor.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's Batman was okay in this movie because he plays more of a father figure to the group rather than action-fighting Batman. But Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman truly brings a warmth to every scene she is in, as always. And Ezra Miller's Flash is so entertaining, often speaking what the audience is thinking. He has so many moments that are laugh-out-loud funny that he humanizes the often too-serious Batman and Superman.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.

I don't trust the official critics people, something tells me they are paid to criticize about movies so the makers don't earn much and the movie flops. I could watch this movie anytime and the previous ones as well like BVS Man of Steel Wonder Woman etc. So tell me if I and most others can watch the movie over and over and still enjoy it like the first time is the movie actually bad? What's wrong with people? People have become accustomed to negativity and with the modern era of technology and free speech all they do is find fault with something and publish it to the world and stop others from even giving something a try. The movie is really nice. I love the cast as I did in previous movies and Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher and Jason Momoa were awesome with their debut with their characters.

"HorrorFan6969","9","2","8","18 November 2017"," Another underrated masterpiece by our friends from DC
","It's the definition of entertainment. Joss Whedon (Avengers 1 & 2) made about more than half of this film and the script. And seriously, he made a terrific job. Where he failed with his Avengers. I know people will want to kick me in the balls, but Avengers was good. But less good each time you watch it again. It's good to see the Avengers, but the plot feels so empty, and this is where he excels here. The film feels like 4 good hours into 2. And that's not negative. Because you never have one single minute that is boring.<br/><br/>The addition of new heroes in Jason Momoa's Aquaman, Ezra Miller's Flash, Vic Stone the Cyborg, Ray Parker I think the name of the actor ? Made the film so fun and entertaining to watch. Steppenwolf as the main villain that appear after like 10 minutes of film is awesome, because they talk to us about his history and what the hell he wanted. Because at first, we don't understand his motive.<br/><br/>When Superman show off around half of film, i was so stunned. Man, the way he look Bad CGI ? Not at all ! The CGI is effective. I thought the Cyrborg will look weak with the trailers. He looks as real as the charismatic underrated Joe Morton (His father in the film).<br/><br/>See it in theaters, because it's so much quality not only filmmaking but for the special effects. never, i did see something this good and entertaining since Suicide Squad. Easily better than the last DC films, and that include the great Wonder Woman that I love as much as any other fans !"
"PapaGin","9","2","8","16 November 2017"," A no-frills superhero adventure (MILD SPOILERS)
","Justice League is the movie DC fans have been waiting for, and for me, it delivers. It also works as a fun flick for general audiences who don't need to be hooked into comics to enjoy it. <br/><br/>The characters are surprisingly fleshed out enough without having to resort to extensive dialogue or scenes. You can just tell from what they say and how they say it. Take Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) for example. As his first cinematic incarnation it's not hard to tell that he's the newbie in the group. The way he was portrayed was spot on to get that across. So was Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and his inexperience in his new body. It took a few lines during an exchange with his father to set his backstory down. Everybody else was the same, especially a certain someone we've all been waiting for. That whole sequence was amazing.<br/><br/>Steppenwolf as the villain was adequate, not great, but it worked. Some may say he was disappointing, but again, none of his actions weren't already set up by a few lines of dialogue. From there one can ascertain his motivations. And the guy certainly didn't need a monologue to accomplish his mission, he'd rather act than talk.<br/><br/>The action is spot on. Again, DC is unbeaten when it comes to showcasing power in their characters. And the team exemplifies their dynamic by playing to each other's strengths. Don't expect it to be like the Avengers where each member goes their own way to do what they do. Here you actually see the team work and struggle together all throughout. You would think a group with Superman in it would not be able to do what they're good at when Supes can just beat the crap out of everybody. I was surprised how they managed to utilize everyone's strengths and make each one work with the other's.<br/><br/>The pacing is fine, it works here. If you come looking for BvS depth and subtlety, then you may be left wanting. Justice League did a good job on focusing on what it was set for without having to worry about too much universe building. It's not overtly riddled with philosophy like the previous films, and most of the things you will see and hear directly involve the plot itself. They went ahead and kept it going till the end.<br/><br/>Forget what the critics say. They'll always find something to complain about. Take the plot for example. Calling it thin would imply expectations of something more grandiose, but it's not necessarily bad, and it works for this movie. Not a single turn wasn't explained in this movie, if you pay attention."

","Taken away from the director after a full year of filming, reshot in 2 months, and released 3 months later....it's a lifeless film. You might hate Batman v Superman, and that's your prerogative, and you might even prefer this film, but personally this film had no artistic voice behind it."
"tharris190","7","2","9","25 April 2020"," So much exposition and a wildly fluctuating tone
","This movie had so much to do, so it ended up cramming in a bunch of exposition and only halfway explained crucial details about the main plot device and undeveloped villain. ""Mother-boxes"" sounds like a lame ripoff of the Infinity Stones in a post-MCU era regardless of source material, and ""Steppenwolf"" is a vaguely defined character with the goofy name of a famous rock band.<br/><br/>Those issues aside, it's clear the crew tried very hard to pull everything together, so it's a shame the effort comes across as half-baked and dull. The producers are probably at fault for rushing this series to align with releases from the MCU.<br/><br/>The film hinges itself on its heroes, but Ezra Miller as Flash either can't deliver the emotional depth required for his scenes with Billy Crudup as his father, or the director dropped the ball for those crucial scenes. These moments stick out in a bad way due to Miller's bad acting. The rest of the cast does a great job.<br/><br/>There are some great fight scenes, but most of the film is exposition. It's like watching characters read the plot summary with intermittent action scenes, interrupted by brief emotional beats and Ezra Miller's clumsy line delivery.<br/><br/>I gave this a 7 because despite obvious flaws, I recognize the source material was written for children. This dark film seems to be intended for adults. Glaring issues: the tone fluctuating wildly from scene to scene, bad CGI for certain elements including the villain, and on-the-nose, mechanical sounding expository dialogue."

","Iam a DC fan, always have been so my judgement might be a little biased . I think the movie was awesome with the glorious action sequences and good acting all round. The best part for me was that finally Hollywood got Superman right. I am going for a repeat just to see Superman shine all over again as he should. That is not to say that the others were any less awesome. Aquaman was flamboyant, Flash was funny and steals the show all over. Cyborg did a pretty decent job. Batman was fantastic in bringing the team together and being the human link in the team. Wonderwoman shines every time and comes a close second to Superman. Superman is the man here and it was good to see him in a new light towering above all others. Overall, well done. As I fan , I expected no more."

"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","5 October 2018"," What even is this?
","So, an alien from outer space slash other dimension has arrived to Earth, seeking a cube-shaped thing of power, bringing with him an army of insectoid people. A grumpy, slightly older man dressed all in black has to gather together a group of superheroes in order to face this threat. But can they stand together or will their internal squabbling tear the group apart? What movie is this?<br/><br/>If you answered The Avengers... well, right there is your problem. DC's Justice League is almost an insult. It's not like DC hasn't tried to emulate Marvel before with their films, but this right here is so blatant that it has to be deliberate. I mean, couldn't the MacGuffin have been at least some other shape? Every single viewer is going to be thinking of the Tesseract, so why even go there. You're doing yourself no favours with such a move.<br/><br/>Aside from that the film suffers mostly from the same problems as the other DC movies, with the exception of Wonder Woman. Too much, too soon, with too many characters. With The Avengers we already knew all of the key players. With Justice League we know Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, but the characters of Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman are completely new to us. Aside from that brief cameo by Flash in Batman v Superman, but that was exactly like I said: brief.<br/><br/>This means that this film has to introduce three whole new characters in its run time. Four, actually, if you count the villain. At least with The Avengers we already knew Loki. Thanos was a new one, but he was more of a puppet master behind the scenes and not the primary antagonist of the film. And I'm sorry, for a movie such as this, four new characters is too much. Something has to give.<br/><br/>Not helping the matters is the fact that the film doesn't look great. Almost all of the backgrounds are CGI and it shows. I've seen better graphics in video games that are almost a decade old. The action scenes are choreographed somewhat decently, but once again I find it hard to get invested when I don't really know any of the players.<br/><br/>DC is in too much of a hurry. Marvel has proven that the superhero craze is not going anywhere for the time being. They could have easily given all of these characters their standalone movie and then went ahead with the Justice League. This is too much, too soon, and quite frankly watching it made me angry."

","I am not biased against DC comics, i like marvel more but my favorite superhero is Batman and i do enjoy a lot of DC properties. when i heard Justice league is being made into a movie i was excited. despite the epic failures that were Batman V Superman, and Suicide Squad i did in fact enjoy wonder woman despite being the dc version of captain america the first avenger. I was hoping DC would redeem itself with this movie. To say i was letdown would be an understatement. the tagline of the movie is You can't save the world alone, but the movie ends with superman being resurrected and defeating Steppenwolf without breaking a sweat. in other words the poster itself lied to us and that is the least of my criticisms. the movie tries too hard to be the dceu version of the avengers. i say too hard because it's pretty much the same thing only with characters you don't give a damn about. think about it The plot of 2012's The Avengers is bad guy comes to earth with alien army and tries to take it over, heroes unite to defeat him. the same thing can be said about justice league and the worst part of that is the villain Steppenwolf is a pawn in Darkseid's scheme just like Loki was to Thanos. at least we got to see Thanos at the end of the avengers, we don't get a single frame of Darkseid and we won't until part 3 which i actually hope won't happen. Also the characters in Justice league aren't just bland and annoying, they are underdeveloped and unrelatable the worst being Steppenwolf who is just trying to conquer earth because the script says he wants to; no motivation, no character. the only reason i'm giving this movie one extra star is because the action is good but that's the only plus side, and even then most of the fighting is just really crappy cgi that looks like it belongs in the cartoon Reboot from the 90's."
"feyipuk","4","1","3","15 September 2018"," CGI and close up shots don't a good story make
","Following on from Batman vs Superman, DC had a problem with Superman and this is a contrived way of correcting that, while also introducing some of their other characters which they can spin off more films from. 
That's the only reason I can think of for having such a dull villain, who basically becomes just a side show to the main characters. There's a fleeting mention of Darkseid - his nephew and considered the archenemy of the Justice League - yet Steppenwolf doesn't really have a big plan besides finding some mystical devices, that he had thousands of years ago and didn't get to use properly, and try to destroy the planet (edit: there is a deleted scene online that actually shows Darkseid, but for what ever reasons, it was removed from the original film).<br/><br/>The League itself isn't much better. Jason Momoa pretty much channels the same style he had as Ronan in Stargate Atlantis; muscle bound and brooding. Ray Fisher gives a dark and menacing portrayal of Cyborg, as he comes to terms with his transformation, and as a fan of Eureka it was good to see Joe Morton back as a scientist (and there's the other connection to the creation of Skynet in the Terminator franchise). <br/><br/>It might have been more enjoyable if they'd given them origin story films before throwing them into the group so this film doesn't have to run through their introductions. Having them join an already established character, like Batman, might make sense in other franchises, but they are established characters, with plenty of comic pedigree. Instead, we have to wait to find out more about them, then go back to Justice League to see what is going on.<br/><br/>We've already had Wonder Woman's introduction, and Justice League carries on with the close up face shots and beautifully tailored outfits (even my wife thought Theresa May would love a pair of leather trousers like she wears).<br/><br/>And lastly The Flash. I get it that DC don't want to integrate their TV and film universes, yet having four years of The Flash being on TV and obviously the comics creating an image of Barry Allen, Ezra Millers Flash is more like a take off from the new Spiderman; a kid with powers, but no direction to use them. Grant Gustins version is more together and focused, which he needs to be for a long running series. If anything, he ends up reminding me of Andy Samberg in Brooklyn 99. <br/><br/>And the reason for that is Grant Gustin wouldn't work so well with Ben Afflecks Batman. He still doesn't have the presence compared to Gal Gadot or Henry Cavill, or even Jeremy Irons, yet he's supposedly the central character tracking down the members of the League. As he says, his superpower is money!<br/><br/>Given their wealth of available backstories, DC do seem to be squandering their opportunities to make truly great films, in exchange for CGI nonsense."

","I wasn't expecting much from this movie ever since I saw the trailer and since the DCEU failed at creating movies outside of ""Wonder Woman"" so to put this all together this movie sucked! This movie had terrible CGI throughout the whole movie. Who in the hell is Steppenwolf?! If you're going to create a great villain make one that is well known not one that no one is going to remember. Cyborg is too depressing in this movie. The Flash really did nothing in this movie when he could have done so much with his ability and could have actually done some damage to Steppenwolf. The Amazon's prove why they are still badass and had a better fight scene then the Justice League themselves. Ben Affleck as Batman is a terrible choice he just looks like he's cosplaying as him and not taking the role seriously and makes Batman look pathetic! The bank scene with the terrorits and Wonder Woman was unnecessary especially because the main terrorist keeps shooting in one direction and Wonder Woman is deflecting every bullet the terrorist could have literally shot the other way. Steppenwolf was not a threat at all and did nothing but collect boxes. He died knowing what his army fed on which is fear and he relied too much on his axe. They made it look like this army was powerful, but ended up ending pretty fast. Where the hell is Superman's black suit? Too much comedy for a universe that is supposed to be ""dark"". If these Mither Boxes are what Steppenwolf was looking for why would you leave them with the humans and not the Green Lanterns that would have been a better option. On the bright side Aquaman actually looked pretty amazing for a character that is overrated. Don't waste your time on this movie it had potential but ended up being a real disappointment!"

"autisticsophist","10","1","3","30 June 2018"," The MOST Inspirational, yet Entertaining and Thoughtful Superhero Movie since Wonder Woman.
","This film might not have the dark and complicated theme like The Dark Knight, a blend of clumsy humour and irriating jokes like The Avengers, or even the mind-boggling plot of Watchmen or the mind-blowing philosophy and action sequences of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but it's CERTAINLY worth watching. <br/><br/>First things first, the heroes all have feelings for each other, and it's a relationship that EVOLVES over time, which The Flash could manipulate with his charm. For instance, both Flash and Cyborg gradually developed a steady friendship through their backgrounds and how they accidentally got these ""gifts"", Bruce and Diana learn not only to respect each other but also to take care of one another. Superman was Earth's beacon and Bruce was that of the team. Wonder Woman inspires people, making everyone strive to become their better selves while Bruce inspires Diana to do so. Batman, who now uses much less violent guns, is a great mentor to the Flash, and even got his back, with grabling hook in a stunning visual style. Aquaman, who initially refused to join the team and did not like Bruce, Barry and somewhat despise Cyborg and adored only Wonder Woman, learnt to reevalute their friendship with a teeny help of her own magic. 
Even Bruce was worried about Clark's life after a heroic moment, proving to the audience that the vigilante cares about him more than just his abilities to save the world, Clark was then officially Bruce's friend. Diana binds the team togheter and at one point leads the team. Everyone, at the end of the movie, was a family. Unlike The Avengers, who are just partners and teamates or ""a chemical mixture that makes chaos"".
The villain may be a bit disappointing but not generic, our antagonist doesn't simply wish to terraform our lovely planet but has a motivation to do so for he's decided mankind was worthless and beneath him. Even the alien henchmen called parademons, who feed on fear, are terrifying, whereas the Chitauri, bots from the two Avengers films or clowns from the old Tim Burton's film and thugs from The Dark Kngight Rises are just ridiculous and annoying.
The jokes are more hillarious and meaningful than crappy quips vomitted at the audience as in Avengers 2, but instead did the best of jobs at relieving the intensity of the film. Speaking of which, this film successfully evaded all the gloom in BvS and The Dark Knight, but still creates an enjoyable feel with all the authentic humour that was all well-placed, and when things need to get dark, the film still offers a genuine feeling of fear and tension, reduced afterwards by mild to extremely relaxing jokes. It's a film filled with optimism and hope, when most Marvel movies, excluding the first one ever, Captan America 2, Thor 3, Guadians of the Galaxy, Spider-man: Home-coming, and Avengers 3, are just over-the-top superhero films, full of explosions, deafening sounds and furry, signifying nothing.
The pacing of this epic movie is brillantly fast enough to keep things exciting all the time, unlike X-men: Apocalyse or The Dark Knight Rises, where people have to sit through two thirds of the screentime to see some interesting things. The plot is thick enough to make sense, while it could have been better if the good guys' plan was more thoughtful. Anyway, it was well-executed. The deeper meanings of this film rise above all else, and the acting performences, especially of the Flash, Diana and Bruce, deserve praising. 
Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon produce really satisfying and stunning visuals, whether. it's practical or CG. All except for the mustache removal, which honestly wasn't too distracting.
I would highly reccomend watching this movie in a lifetime."

Affleck even looks like the cartoon version of The Dark Knight. And yes, I think he is better than Clooney. Kilmer. And yes, leaps and bounds better than that miserable Christian Bale. <br/><br/>When people think of Justice League, and comic book movies based on the DC Universe, the first thing we do is offer advice on how to make them better. Why? Because they are so terribly flawed. For one, the movies take itself way too seriously. The characters rarely smile. I saw a few smiles in Justice League, but not enough. The movies are painted dark blue, but not in a fun gothic way, like the original Batman (Burton) movie. But in this grey, dark blue-ish dismal way. People go to comic book movies for fun. Thankfully, Affleck embodies Batman enough that it saves the movie, along with Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Speaking of which, WW is what a comic book hero is supposed to be. Her movie was fun, light-hearted, and entertaining. <br/><br/>The problem I have with Justice League is that the characters don't seem to have chemistry.

"jamesrupert2014","5","1","3","7 May 2018"," Unimpressive and uninteresting
","Yet again, we threatened by an alien with God-like powers and a team of superheros must overcome their differences and commit to the cause. The plot revolves around the celestial villain ""Steppenwolf"" and his search for three magical MacGuffins that will ensure his conquest of Earth. Habitual loner and inadequate diplomat Batman assembles a team of 'enhanced humans' and the rest of the film, when the team isn't bickering amongst themselves, is essentially a fight between heroic CGI and evil CGI. As lead villain, ""Steppenwolf"" is an uninteresting, poorly-rendered, pseudo-classical character who wields a magical ax and has an army of flying 'parademons' at his beck-and-call. Other than the aforementioned Caped Crusader, the League includes a resurrected Superman (with a digitally-enhanced lip that has been the subject of much on-line discussion), Wonder Women (the gorgeous Gal Godot, who alone is worth an extra rating point), Aquaman (a grumpy, hard-drinking merman), The Flash (an awkward teenager somewhere on the spectrum), and Cyborg (a flying interface with half a face). Other than Wonder Women, none of the heroes are very engaging and the film is full of tedious filler, such as the constantly threatened Russian family, who's purposes seem to be 1) putting a 'human face' to the victims, and 2) generating debate as to why parademons, who smell fear and can tear the miniguns off the bat-tank with their bare hands, can't overwhelm a wooden farm house protected by one man with a shotgun. We also have to put up with Superman waking up from the dead in a grumpy mood, requiring the rest of the team to take shots at him to bring him around (Cyborg's armor conveniently, and temporarily, develops a mind of its own and fires the first shot in this silly internecine scuffle). On the topic of ""Cyborg"": isn't building a massive, armoured hybrid topped off with half of a 'flesh and blood' face like leaving a womp-rat sized hole in your Death Star? The ending and 'ironic' demise of the lead malefactor is right out of a Saturday morning cartoon. Not much in this movie works: there is little that is novel or imaginative in the story or in the imagery, the inter-hero 'banter' is forced and predictable, and the CGI is unconvincing and unimpressive. Watchable if you like this sort of thing, but even then, ""Justice League"" is in the 'view once, criticise often' category of CGI extravaganzas."
"Gambitt","4","1","3","4 May 2018"," Zack Snyder does it again
","Imagine you are tasked with creating a superhero team movie. The seemingly obvious way to do this is have your individual heroes meet up and then jump into showing the newly formed team facing obstacles together. Justice League is a case study in why this is actually a terrible way to produce a team-up movie.<br/><br/>A better way would be to build up the individual team members, and the relationships between them prior to the actual formation of the team. And if you're already on a tight timeline, because, say, you're trying to catch up to the competition, all the more reason to make good use of whatever few prequels you might have access to. So the fact that Zack Snyder squandered Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman on incoherent action sequences and epic slo-mo glamour shots really takes a toll on the misbegotten Justice League.<br/><br/>Furthermore, a good team-up movie isn't really so much about the team facing the world, but rather all the dynamics within the team itself. What little attempt there is to show this in Justice League is equal parts superficial, cliched, and dull.<br/><br/>Justice League was already going to be a heavy lift considering all this, but the basic film-making flaws complete the disaster.<br/><br/>As with Snyder's other DC movies, the pacing is awful. The script is lifeless and flat. The CGI is absolutely terrible, a problem compounded by its reckless overuse. The action is loud and underwhelming.<br/><br/>The low production value of Cyborg is inexcusable in a movie of this scale. He looks like something you might see in a arrowverse spinoff on CW (which in spite of its cheerful cheesiness, produces characters with way more spirit and chemistry than anyone in Snyder's DC-verse). <br/><br/>There seemed to be a lot of critical commentary that Ezra Miller's Flash was a rare bright spot in the movie. I have to disagree with that. His character and his lines felt just as forced and predictable as everyone else.<br/><br/>Then there is Jason Momoa's Aquaman. All I can say is that I hope the makers of the Aquaman film move away from the lord of the brocean interpretation here.<br/><br/>Finally there is the villain, Steppenwolf. Sweet jesus, where to begin with Steppenwolf. Creating a solid villain has always been a challenge for super hero movies, including Marvel films. But it feels like in Steppenwolf, Snyder went out of his way to perfectly model every single complaint about poorly made super villains. <br/><br/>I give Justice League a generous 4 / 10. The good news is that its lousy box office performance might force Warner Brothers to reconsider the direction of these movies."

","Superman is dead! Like the old saying goes ""you can't keep a good man down."" With the help of Bruce Wayne, brings an elite squad of superheroes to stop an alien force taking over the world. With the help of Barry Allen/The Flash, Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, Victor Stone/Cyborg, Arthur Curry/Aquaman - they help Bruce revitalize a broken superhero by bring Clark Kent back to life. 
 In bringing Superman back to life, it took the entire team to work together to bring back the superhero that we have loved and hold most dear over the last few centuries. But it took more than that to stop Steppenwolf from bringing chaos to earth. 
 I loved this movie more than you could ever imagine. Zach Snyder is the best in the business. When I first saw Justice League, I was thinking how could they bring an elite team of superheroes together to fight the outer world enemies that threaten the course of humanity? But they pulled it off without a hitch. I can't wait to see what they are going to do with another Justice League. Maybe, just maybe add to the team"

","I had very low expectations due to the numbers in the reviews. (Don't like spoilers, so I avoid them like the plague! They ruin any suspense or discovery.) The movie is definitely worth watching. The value of a machine is more than the sum of its parts... which is part of the theme here. Also, to add, I could watch Gal all day and not get tired of her... (She is a goddess on and off the screen... in fact, they all looked great.) Some stuff was cheesy, but that is OK. It is, in itself, a great superhero movie.

","This movie sucks! The characters were undeveloped the plot and main villain were lazy and flawfull. Superman had like 5 frickin minutes of screen time! And one of the big things there were SOOO MANY scenes from the Trailers that were cut from the movie, it was more than the typical amount of deleted scenes. The movie was overall to short and had a very undeveloped plot and characters. Not to mention there were so many scenes cut that some CHARACTER altogether were cut from the movie like Iris West, Darkside, and Lex Luther. And watching it a second time you realize it just boring and plain out bad. Part of the problem was that Zack Snyder was fired because of various reasons and Joss Whedon came in and did the reshoots. He basically cut an hour of the movie the original Snyder's cut was 2 hours 50 min. So just give us the Snyder's cut."

","Justice League, for me, really underscores how unimaginative Hollywood has become. <br/><br/>This film is yet another super hero cliche that exhaustively walks the same predictable path as any other film in the genre. Character development is more or less missing, there.'s no real personal insight, nor any attempt to offer any depth or variety of story line. <br/><br/>The result is a forgettable, uniform experience, that begs the question; ""why bother""? We of course know the answer is no doubt profit but really why can't financial and creative imperatives sit side by side? They did once upon a time when Hollywood produced wonderful, creative films, that were fresh and imaginative and yes, profitable. <br/><br/>In summary, watchable, wholly predictable, with a focus on exposition and action eye candy but don't expect much else or you will be disappointed. 5/10 from me."

","Justice League is a movie with some decent scenes in it, held up with duct tape and incompetent hands.<br/><br/>Director Zack Snyder did a good job with Man of Steel. His follow up of Batman V Superman was a giant mess, saved somewhat by the extended cut of the film. He had to leave JL during production due to a family tragedy. Joss Whedon (Avengers/Buffy the Vampire Slayer) was tasked with taking over. What happened next was two conflicting visions of the DCU and studio interference. The film became a mess in terms of story, visual effects and tone.<br/><br/>It's a well known fact that some Warner Bros executives pushed for the film to be released, despite visual effects being substandard, so that they could earn money bonuses within a set time frame. This resulted in the butchering of Superman's face. They had to CGI out the actor's moustache and the results were laughable. Superman looks like Desperate Dan throughout the film. It's embarrassing on so many levels. Superman is an icon and this film has single handedly destroyed the image of this inspiring comic book god.<br/><br/>The villain is weak and generic, with nothing appealing about him at all. Ben Affleck's Batman is underwhelming and the rest of the heroes are pale shadows of what they could have been.<br/><br/>DC/WB will continue this current DCU but with less dedicated fans due to this disaster of a film. They should have left Superman six feet under."

","I will be brief and to the point. Reasons people hated this movie: Ridiculusly made CGI villain with angry kid attitude. Ridiculous aproach on the Flash (he is the comic relief of the movie) and bad jokes all over the place. Even at the dramatic climax!
But if you can look past the times they try to be funny and focus on the heroes instead of the villain, you get to see a really good adaptation of the characters you love from the comics. It just looks like we are already watching the director's cut version of the movie with all the cringy scenes that should have been left out.<br/><br/>P.S.

Team assembly part of the movie is happening very fast; 
We don't know a lot about the characters such as Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg. During the movie we get some info about them but that's not enough to build a relationship with the characters; 
Very lame villain about whom we also don't know much, almost nothing at all; Barry Alen aka the Flash was probably the worst character in the movie. Ezra Miller was not a good match for this role; 
CGI was at many points terrible. Movement of the Flash in the speed force was like I was back in year 2000. <br/><br/>This one had a potential to be an epic move but came out just below average."

"antoninisk","1","1","3","24 December 2017"," Zack Snyder, rich mans Uwe Boll
","Unfortunately Zack Snyder is becoming Uwe Boll of the wealthy. 
Unlimited budget and creative power, big names and shallow to to say the least , awful awful movies. 
I watched Snyder through Dawn of the Dead remake and 300. I really really liked both of these films and indeed he seemed very promising.I must have seen DoTD his version like 50 times each time discovering some small new detail that he creatively tried to fit being his first time working with a big studio and budget.... He did really good there,but probably he had some people breathing down his neck...
And 300 well what to say about it?He created a movie aesthetically never before seen ..... 
After that he gave us Suckerpunch !!!!!One of the worst films in the history of...history!!!
But then you say OK maybe it was just an experiment,the guy was just fooling around, he was aiming at a specific generation/culture ,and then you get MoS!!!!!
What the guy was thinking? Superman destroying Metropolis?Acting like a spoiled brat? No brains at all? Millions of dead?
But then you get BvsS and you're like OK he probably will do better and then you get ""Martha""!!!!""Martha""!!!!!!He managed to destroy the one most iconic battles with..... ""Martha""!?!?!?Ohhh its his mommy...Hey my mom is Martha too.So you have a mom too.I guess i wont kill you weird space alien menace for humanity..Very genius plot indeed and subtexts i would have never thought....
Its like losing control over a plane and every action you make worsens the situation....
JL is a flop. Bad acting(because of bad directing),boring sequences, horrible horrible pace... 
In the first ten minutes we see JL formed like children in a playground...seriously?That's the best you could think of? Batman throwing a batarang aimed at a kids head?At that point the ceiling of the movie theater became much more interesting than this....
And then he is like""Hey im like having a team you wanna join?""
Who writes these?Do really people get paid thousands to write corny like this?
Way too much comic relief from Flash, Batfleck although he did his part in BvsS (excoet the Martha thing) became a sidekick and shallower than Superman (whats your superpower-i'm rich) and Alfred...really? Aquaman way too cool (and im being sarcastic here).We all read about Jason Momoa how cool he was while filming but why do i have to see this on film? Although Momoa has the physique and looks i thin he failed miserably ..and WW well...she cant save the film on her own. Cyborg was passable until he became BF with Flash and started throwing punchlines ""keep the mermaid away from me"" really?
The most interesting characters were the supporting ones.The Amazons ,the Atlanteans ,were acting much better and were much better written than the main heroes...
I will not write about Superman ,as the guy (Snyder)destroyed the most Iconic superhero for ever from MoS so i wont spend another second in this....
Its a horrible horrible mess and obviously they're trying to catch up MCU.
It doesn't get any clearer than this...
MCU took their time.
Building one hero at a time. And even with this many movies they also made mistakes like Civil war , but they did with what they had.(very few heroes compared to the comic books).Still was a very entertaining movie to watch. 
Compared with JL, Civil War is a MASTERPIECE!!!!
You cannot compensate millions of dead story line(MoS) with punchlines (JL) . Liking characters on the big screen is not like this.
WB don't take your audiences for stupid.Just because we read comic books and daydream doesn't mean were idiots....
Dear Mr Snyder. 
Power is not about doing whatever the heck you can think of.
That's why the real world is plummeting.
Power is about restrain and control. 
Its obvious you directed with larger than life criteria. But if you go way too far , heroes become distant and lifeless.
We want heroes to like and be role models , heroes who are better and smarter than us. 
If i have to see a rich idiot in Batman attire i read the tabloids. 
If i have to see an evil deity i just watch the news.
You can do better than this.....maybe
The net is full with videos of idiots doing stupid things....
See JL on DVD sales 0.99 if you don't have something better to do like shoveling snow or something...
Don't spend your hard earned money for this....NOT WORTH IT!!!!"
"mister-hallin","1","1","3","24 December 2017"," This Is Not Zack Snyder's Movie
","First of all, I'm sorry for my bad English. This is my first review ever because I can't help to say something about this particular movie.<br/><br/>I've watched so many movies and saw how special effects are done so that made me aware whether it's good or bad. <br/><br/>#1: I guess we all agree that superman's moustache is a total disaster. I will tell you no more about this.<br/><br/>#2: The first batman scene. You can sense its artificial environment here. Let's do a comparison. Snyder's 300 is shot almost 90% indoors. But, amazingly it's still turned out to be awesome. But in this batman scene the lighting is so bad that you can feel that it's shot indoors. Umm, and the wind. This is outdoor scene guys, I mean come on, these guys fight on the top of buildings but there is no wind swooshing on the thief's hair. The worst thing is the thief's got splashed by water made his hair wet. But immediately his hair remain still and dry.<br/><br/>#3: Whedon fired the make-up artists too? We know that Whedon fired Junkie XL from making the score. But make-up artists? No you can't do that! You can see the whole movie that Affleck's hair is changing a lot of times, even in one scene. This is very, very disturbing. Also when Amy Adams shared a scene with Cavill in corn field, Cavill's hair was changed. He got himself an extra hair. Don't forget Amy Adam's hair was so bad you can clearly tell that she wore a wig. My point is, in the BvS I was surprised that Affleck looked so great, his wrinkled skin, his hair, even though, you know, in real life he's not that great. This isn't Snyder's work, or I could say that it's not Syder's team work.<br/><br/>#4: Batman horrible changes. The transition between Snyder to Whedon brought this movie a disaster. Affleck's got chubbier under Whedon direction, he barely fits the batman mask. His cheek is popping out ready to explode. Also, the eyes. We realize that Affleck wore an eyeshadow under the mask. But, sadly, everytime chubbier Affleck was in Batman costume, we can see that the eyeshadow wasn't perfectly done. I can see slightly skin color below Affleck's eyes. Snyder's team would've never done that.<br/><br/>#5: Batman and Superman costume. Oh my God, what is the matter with Whedon?! In Man of Steel or BvS people was so impressed with this duo costume. I hardly sure about that now. We can see the pads crystal clear!<br/><br/>Now I will tell you about the quality of the movie that Snyder would have done.<br/><br/>#1: Zooming in 2 or 3 times technique. Snyder wasn't the inventor of this technique but it becomes his marks. He had done this in 300, Sucker Punch, MoS, and BvS. This technique made the scenes more dramatic and epic visually. But in Justice League I didn't see it at all.<br/><br/>#2: Everytime Superman flies it has a dramatic effetcs in MoS or BvS. But not in this movie. Even look more stupid in racing scene with Flash.<br/><br/>#3: Dream sequence. What I like about Snyder's work is he added dream sequences in his last two movies. It's very cool that Marvel copied this style (I think) in Age of Ultron. Again, none in Justice League.<br/><br/>#4: To be honest I'm a fan of Marvel. But I also adore Snyder's work. Once I'm a bit jealous with the dark tone Snyder used in his DC movies, something that Marvel wouldn't do. But, JL got a more cheerful tone with silly jokes. I don't know if this should make me happy or sad.<br/><br/>#5: Mediocre cinematography. Even BvS wasn't too great, there were some great scenes that makes Snyder a great director. Like when Bruce Wayne running and saved a kid in opening scene. Or two people that retrived a Kryptonite under the ocean. Simple right? But Snyder can make something great out of the simplest thing. Oh, and one thing I would never forget in Snyder's style is he likes to use slo-mo scene to make something more beautifully dramatic. Example, in the last scene when Lex Luthor was in prison and got threathened by Batman, and then the comes some slo-mo scene, back and forth shots, I don't know how to describe it in English, but it was very cool. Snyder would never forget about emotion in a visual shot which we missed in Justice League.<br/><br/>There are so many things I want to criticize but many comments already speak it for me. I consider this Justice League movie isn't Snyder's work. Never in a million years he would do somthing like this."

","We, who are adults, must remember that these are cinematic adaptations of children's comic book stories & therefore will naturally lack a depth or rather a complexity that the adult palate craves. Occasionally these stories can be given some weight to entice the adult taste buds (I'm thinking primarily of Nolan's Batman) or a mature stealthy comic slant, like The Guardians Of The Galaxy, that will go over the head of kids but land firmly in the adult mind; sadly Justice League offers none of these things, but, *does give us strippers fighting late 60's rock/pop troubadours over a Nintendo Game Cube.*<br/><br/>Hollywood once again sells us Judaism in this film (there is no mention of any other religion) which is getting decidedly prevalent & creepy in US film & TV output.

","The only ones who seemed more bored than I was in this movie were the actors themselves. The only one who seemed genuinely into this movie was the kid they hired to be the flash. He also had the best lines, if you could call them that. There were only two entertaining spots in the movie. 1) Flash asks Batman what powers he has and he says, ""I'm rich!"" and then 2) when they are discussing bringing back Superman the Flash voices his concern on how Superman is coming back inserting a comment about ""Pet Cemetery."" Then when Superman comes back he does appear to not be the ""Superman"" he once was and the Flash says, ""Pet Cemetery!"" So mildly amusing. Other than that I can sum this movie up as: BOOM BOOM BOOM, POW POW POW, some discussions that go nowhere, BOOM BOOM BOOM, POW POW POW, etc. Really there was no plot or storyline here that I could make out. It was loud and boring. Sorry, but that is all."
"Ziya90","1","1","3","4 December 2017"," A Complete Disaster
","Where do I start? They showed and revealed too much in the trailers first, it was a mistake, big mistake! While watching the movie yesterday, it felt like ""I saw this before, also saw this, also saw that! Over advertising and introduction especially at movie theaters have sicken us. We have lost our desire to be excited. I always say trailers from 90s and 80s must be a lesson for producers and filmmakers in the industry. They have been in a rush to putting this ""team"" together, making this movie as soon as possible! Well, the result is pathetic. People in these days don't try to make a great movie, instead to make a great amount of profit. That's the problem. CGI in this movie is very cheesy like I couldn't believe my eyes. Especially the scenes with Steppenwolf are like a video game in medium quality. Henry Cavill's upper lip ""touch"" needs no comment. Batman/Bruce Wayne suffers from a character shift from ""BvS: Dawn of Justice"". He is a totally different man here and I have no idea they did it intentionally or unintentionally! He is not serious, not powerful, not intimidating and definitely not a leader in this movie. Flash is fun, but not the version that the character deserves. His jokes are mostly forced and pretentious. The catastrophic events are not handled well, there is a family who serves almost no purpose etc. Aquaman was very intimidating and cool in the trailers, but in the movie, it is meh! After a while, the character loses his charm, from the top, he goes down like Batman. I like and the most importantly were satisfied with Cyborg. He was the only character with Wonder Woman who gave me reason during the movie to enjoy the picture. The villain of the movie, Steppenwolf with a very poor CGI is no much different than that bland villain Ares of Wonder Woman which is a decent movie by the way. Wonder Woman is the star of this movie. She steals the show and it is wonderful, but the entrance of the character was more like a parody itself. Mostly, character motivations are missing and character development is poor. As for Superman, it was one of the biggest screen disappointments I have ever had in my life! No heart, no soul and it makes ""Man of Steel"" a masterful work of art or a great masterpiece! They cannot feel us the consequences of a world without Superman. Even Superman Returns was very good at discussing these issues. Batman and Superman here are like the parodies of their actual characters. What does Superman do in this movie? This means the comeback story isn't handled well. Is there any iconic moment which will give you goosebumps? Well, go and see it for yourself. We cannot feel his real power potential in this saving world adventure. Justice League is a two-hour popcorn entertainment with almost zero background, if you say that's enough for me, then there is nothing to discuss about. For example, the great Commissioner Gordon is just there.. We don't meet him yet. We don't know him yet. Humor is very forced at times. Action scenes are boring and we already saw most of them in the trailers which is a pity for us. I have no interest for Lois Lane anymore. I prefer to look at a picture of Margot Kidder on a wall for hours rather than watching the relationship between Lois Lane and Superman in these movies. The slow motion moments of Flash feels amateurish and it doesn't create any spark, thrill or even fun during the action. By the way, I am still not sure about whether this nerdy version of Flash is hilarious or pathetic? Finally, the second after the credits scene is better than the whole movie itself."

Mission Accomplished).<br/><br/>Well, what a disappointment that was!<br/><br/>I felt the film was way too long. It really was so boring at some places for me. If it wasn't for the tiny bit of humor the Flash injects in the movie and the couple of sarcastic comments from Batman and Aquaman, I wouldn't even have given it the 4 out of 10.

While slightly flawed, at least it had some truly impressive visuals, backed up by a decent story. I was pretty satisfied. Even after the messy Batman v Superman, I still had faith in the DCEU, for it had the ambition to make something outstanding, though being not really successful. While the terrible Suicide Squad disappointed me, the major hit Wonder Woman, which was pretty much successful in every way, refueled my passion for the DCEU.<br/><br/>And then we have Justice League. While it is entertaining, it has just so many problems that make it impossible for me to enjoy.<br/><br/>1. The re-shoots. As many people mentioned, one can easily tell whether a scene is made by Snyder or Whedon.<br/><br/>2. The editing. Too many close-up shots being shown continuously (a very common problem that already happened to many blockbusters, such as Warcraft). Everything happens way too quickly, which means ZERO character development. Therefore it is almost impossible to actually care for the characters if you don't like them already.<br/><br/>3. The visuals. I am hardly a big fan of Zack Snyder, but I find it very enjoyable to watch his unique shots that somewhat capture the feeling of the comics. In Justice League, there is merely any interesting shots; most of the shots are no better than any ordinary blockbusters.<br/><br/>4. The story. The script is SO generic - much more so than Man of Steel and BvS. Everything is expected. There is NO sense of danger, and we simply cannot fear the villain at all. Also, though everyone knows that Superman will return, it is supposed to be very powerful moment. Instead, they managed to somehow make his return in a way that is not thrilling at all.<br/><br/>5. The humor. I don't mind DCEU to be something more light-hearted, but if you want to have humor, at least do it right. The fact is that probably not more than 1 out of 3 jokes in this movie is actually laughable. Other jokes are either stupid, or simply not funny.<br/><br/>Above all, Justice League is a watchable blockbuster that provide just enough fun to make your 2 hours worthwhile. Don't expect more."

LOVED the end credits - stay until the very end! GREAT movie, WATCH IT!!!!!!

"almanjit25","6","1","3","22 November 2017"," An Average Albeit Mildly Fun Film
","5.5-6/10<br/><br/>After the critical bashing that Justice League received upon release, I expected an irredeemable pile of turd but surprisingly it wasn't that awful. Yes, BvS was a monstrosity but this film is far from being one. It's not a great movie, it isn't even a good one but it isn't terrible either. Entertaining and fun in some parts, it's a movie filled with potential that never fully materializes. <br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>1) Wonder Woman - Gal Gadot is fantastic in the role and immediately lights up the screen when she's on it. Her presence lifts up the film.<br/><br/>2) Ezra Miller and Ray Fisher as The Flash and Cyborg respectively - This new Flash is fun and geeky in all the best ways possible. Ray Fisher plays a strong and brooding character who even out does Batman. They don't have much room to shine but when they appear on screen in their few scenes, they are pretty good.<br/><br/>3) Superman and Lois Lane - They bring tenderness, heart and humanity to the film. <br/><br/>4) Superman - He is finally done right and in spectacular fashion.<br/><br/>5) A couple of the earlier action scenes featuring Wonder Woman and the Amazons. <br/><br/>6) Good chemistry between the characters and some light and genuinely touching moments.<br/><br/>7) Jeremy Irons as Alfred is always great to watch.<br/><br/>UNDECIDED:<br/><br/>1) Aquaman - He felt a bit douchey and juvenile for my taste but we'll see where they take his character in later films.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>1) The weak plot - It feels like a B-grade Avengers. WB are so desperate to catch up with Marvel that they put plot on the back- burner in favor of CGI noise-fests. It's all about cash and not about actually creating a great film.<br/><br/>2) The awful villain - Ares from Wonder Woman was worse but man is Steppenwolf weak, one-dimensional and clichÃ©. The boring tyrant bent on conquest and destruction who outlines his maniacal plan and is easily defeated.<br/><br/>3) The garish and cheap-looking CGI - It's ugly and assaulting to the eyes. For a movie with a $300 million budget, the effects are surprisingly hideous. <br/><br/>4) The last act - CGI-overload and predictability galore.<br/><br/>5) The huge boring chunks in the middle where nothing happens and the chunky editing. <br/><br/>6) Some of the dialogue - It's not BvS bad and is a significant improvement but there is still as long way to go. It still feels juvenile. <br/><br/>7) The last post-credits scene - A good thing about this film is that it lacks Lex Luthor as played by Jesse Eisenberg who was one of the reasons BvS was so awful. He returns in the last scene trying to promote further plot lines for future films. He was the weakest link in BvS so I am not looking forward to any film that will bring him front and center. <br/><br/>SUMMARY: It's not an awful film, it has it's moments but could have been better. I'd suggest you watch it on the big screen."
"secretzfan","7","1","3","22 November 2017"," Justice League is a Marvel film
","I have gone back and forth with the amount of praise and criticism I feel this film deserves. After a while of thought after seeing the movie I have come to say I think this movie was a lot of fun on its own. Its not Wonder Woman that is true and it does go darker than some Marvel films ever would, but Justice League is in fact a Marvel film through and through. Rather u like it or hate that. <br/><br/>Having a director like Joss Whedon come in and do re shoots on the film only helps this claim. This film is a result of a whole lot of criticism regarding this entire universe and how it was built. The foundation was never steady to begin with and as a result this film hurts because of that. <br/><br/>Luckily despite that Justice League still manages to come out with a lot of entertainment value that puts a smile on your face. The movie has a lot of funny scenes that do put a smile on your face and make the film a lot more enjoyable. The characters are far more interesting and I enjoy seeing them coming together making for a far better experience<br/><br/>The film does have a few issues tho. The entire second half of the film is a mess from a technical stand point. The editing is really poorly handled and so is the flying green screen overhead. Also mustaches for days. There are some weird cuts and slices and a few other problems that the film has. <br/><br/>Overall Justice League is still a enjoyable film despite some of its flaws that it had. I defiantly want to see it again. It was fun and light and I just really overall enjoyed my experience in the theater."

","The problem with this kind of movies and with almost every superhero flick is simply that there's nobody with a bit of creativity in this genre. I agree there are some scenes what give you fun and a little smile on your face, but most of the time this is a smile of awkwardness. First of all; WTF?! stupid way to begin a movie with a shot through an iPhone. The introduction of the three new characters is not noteworthy. Cyborg is the most boring persona ever. Aquaman was okay in the fighting scene's. At least The Flash was sometimes funny, especially together with Wonder Woman. His slow motion parts were enjoyable, but c'mon guys: why again the 'funny' not serious Deadpool type of guy? The villain, uh i don't know his name anymore.... oh Steppenwolf it is.. STUPID NAME. I think Ben Affleck (Batman)and Henry Cavill (Superman) both don't have the strength to carry a mediocre film like this. Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) has this power but couldn't show it in this film, which jumped from scene to scene. After the Wonder Woman movie I had a bit of hope they were going to the right direction. Unfortunately, it's just another below average film. And with the return of Jesse Eisenberg (Lex Luthor) in the upcoming movie, I'm anything but thrilled."

","Seeing this was a ""nostalgia moment"" because as a kid, I must have had every Justice League comic book in print. (Sold them all later, but that's a different story.) I wanted to see the film to see the treatment given to my childhood heroes.<br/><br/>First, comparing The Avengers and Justice League, it is clear that the two are not on the same level of excellence. OK, maybe not fair to compare, but you know everyone who has seen both movies WILL compare them. The chemistry among the Avengers is there; among the Justice League, not so much. There is a sense of strain among the members.<br/><br/>Some fans don't like Ben Affleck's Batman but he's not so very bad. Compare vs. the Val Kilmer or George Clooney incarnations and he is better. Not as good as Christian Bale or Michael Keaton but not so bad either.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot is still excellent as Wonder Woman, complete with her compassion when (SPOILER) the League discusses reviving Superman. She worries not about the other league members; she worries about Kal-El.<br/><br/>Cyborg was done well. No complaints, but then again, no expectations because we have no comparison base except for a cartoon series. This is a viable superhero and his effects are mostly well done.<br/><br/>Aquaman was a touch snarky, which seems non-canonical but then again, his back story of being left with his father and never knowing his mother might lead him to have an attitude, so not terrible.<br/><br/>My big complaint is that the Flash, one of DC's best and most likable characters and the one with the most compassion, is portrayed as a naive and maybe even a slightly repressed kid. He had the lightning; he had the speed; but he didn't have the maturity or the charity of the canonical Flash.<br/><br/>The villain of the piece is Steppenwolf, strictly a CGI nightmare who looks like a Draughr from Skyrim with a Flaming Pole Axe, Elven armor, and a Horned Steel helmet. His one reference to Darkseid is so fleeting that folks not familiar with the Darkseid canon would miss it or misunderstand it. Some of the professional reviewers appear to NOT be familiar with the canon of Steppenwolf and so totally missed him as the herald of Darkseid. He and the parademons seem slightly hokey.<br/><br/>Most of the finale was shot in a CGI environment that was over-the-top artificial in appearance - which means poor blending. So in some places the effects detracted from rather than enhanced the movie.<br/><br/>You've seem my negative comments. But I still rate this as not a total bomb based on the action sequences and pacing. I might add this to my DVD library but only after the price drops enough for it to find a home in the $5 discount rack at the discount store."
"Lambertart","8","1","3","21 November 2017"," Something old, something new...
","Sooo... I sat behind a huge dude with a massive head and had to watch Justice League leaning to one side. It was worth the discomfort. I liked this movie! Although I am a DC guy, I was not already sold on the re-imagined version of The Flash they were pushing on me. I wanted to see the Cocky, more mature Barry Allen from the Silver age of comics. (But) Like I said, I'm a DC guy so I gave him a shot. Waddaya know, I enjoyed this Flash. Didn't thoroughly like him tripping over his own feet bit, but I get it. They are trying to create a new persona with a younger target market. OK. I'll wait for the mature Flash. I'm a DC guy. I'm really liking Affleck's Batman. I don't think he had enough to do in this movie, but that's to be expected when trying to fit everybody in an ensemble film. I hope he sticks around for the stand alone Batman movie. Gal Gadot lights up the screen every time she's on it so no complaints there. There was a nice bit with Aquaman and her lasso of truth! Speaking of Aquaman... Still trying to get used to the Trident toting rocker version, but It's cool. Works for THIS movie. I wasn't too familiar with the Cyborg character, so I accepted what I saw as presented. I went to this movie with someone who does not read comics, doesn't know much about the DCU and is not familiar with most of the cast/characters. She went on the strength of seeing the last Wonder Woman movie and my recommendation. She liked it a lot! (And) I guess that's the point. Warner Bros is trying to attract a new audience without losing the old one. So yeah, you can't please EVERYONE with this kind of Superhero heritage. Too many years of different incarnations. Will I see the next flick though? You bet... I'm a DC guy."

I was getting mixed feelings at first but after about 30min the movie got my full attention and I started to actually enjoy it so much!

The movie managed to add more humor while keeping the DC comics seriousness!<br/><br/>Pros: .Wonder Woman is very well done..again! .Team work/action is so cool. .A great build up for what to come! .Jason Momoa is just an amazing Aquaman! .Cyborg is way better than expectations!<br/><br/>Cons: .The Flash is by far my favorite but making him constantly the funny guy isn't so accurate! .Batman is a little bit underrated in the fights. .Steppenwolf is not as bad as I imagined but pretty much forgettable."
"Popcorn_Media","6","1","3","21 November 2017"," Is this Just Amazing? JustNICE or JustCrap?
","This right here is the 5th movie in the DC extended universe and by now you'd think they'd gotten pretty good at making them, especially with the same fella directing over half of them? Well Not really.<br/><br/>The film follows Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Godot), as they look to assemble a team of other gifted individuals to help fight off a pending invasion. The death of Superman has left a void on the Earth, and this has paved the way for an ancient evil to return as he attempts to conquer the planet, he must collect some infinity stones artifacts to help him start the end of time (or something like that).<br/><br/>If a story really is a movies backbone then Justice league is disabled.<br/><br/>Characters are most certainly Justice Leagues strong point and as a huge fan of these comic book heroes it was exciting to watch Bruce, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg and Superman all meet up and interactive with each other. The chemistry between the main crew is fantastic and I personally would have loved to have seen more moments like this.<br/><br/>Affleck, Gadot and Cavill (even with his weird CGI top lip) play their roles excellently and the newbies Ezra Miller (The Flash). Jason Momoa (Aquaman) & Ray Fisher (Cyborg) all do a fine job of bringing their characters to life. Ezra Miller adds a lot of humour to proceedings, even if some jokes fall a little flat) and Jason Momoa portrayal of Aquaman goes swimmingly. The only character I'm not a fan of is Ray Fisher's Cyborg. This isn't his fault, in fact his acting is quite possibly the most impressive of all, however his character is very generic and feels very much like a knock off Iron-man.<br/><br/>One of the films biggest issues is it's runtime. A studio imposed time restraint of 2 hours would have been a huge crucifix on Zack Snyder and then his replacement Joss Whedon considering just how much they had to cram into this film. Not only did it have to deal with the repercussions of Batman v Superman but also introduce many new characters and bring with it a powerful new threat. The movie jumps from one scene to the next and the audience is at real risk of getting dizzy. Its all very messy and cumbersome, some scenes could be stand-alone youtube videos with little to connect them to the following scenes The final chapter could have been shot for any other DC movie and then just bolted to the end.<br/><br/>Then we come to the films main villain One of THE worst villains I have ever seen. Steppenwolf (I had to google his name as I couldn't for the life of me remember) is entirely CGI and has no real presence. Muttering words like ""no protectors here, this world will fall..blaah blah blah"" is as shallow and uninspiring as they come. Apparently as a dedicated comic book reader his motivations would be a more clear but to me I had no idea what his problem was and this just highlights how little I cared about the main story.<br/><br/>The action in the film is decent enough and there are some stand out moments that made the nerd in me cry in delight, however so many blatantly obvious CGI backgrounds and almost video game like character moments pulled me out of the moment more often than I'd have liked.<br/><br/>Justice League feels like a cake that was made without all its ingredients and not left in the oven long enough. DC should have taken more time to establish its characters first before throwing them all into the same pot. Overall it was much better than I expected, and the two bonus scenes in the credits show some interesting potential down the road. A handful of nerd porn moments elevated this film out of the shitter and the chemistry between the characters was a joy to watch. It is a flawed piece of entertainment that requires audiences to overlook a lot of issues but I had fun"
"daveanderson-69669","8","1","3","21 November 2017"," Very Entertaining, loved it!
","I loved the justice league film. Looking past some of the dated cgi. I found the movie to be extremely entertaining. People were looking for a plot to the movie but i felt that the plot was to bring the justice league together. If you want full stories of the characters wait for there solo movies. Unlike marvel in which gave many character movies prior to the avengers movie I see it as BvS was a prequel to justice league and that from here the movies branch out to solo movies and connecting back to Justice league 2. It is a different strategy and if people give it a chance they will see it as well. people wanted this movie to be way more epic then it was meant to be and to compare it to batman and robin is stupid. The movie was no where near that bad. Again i loved this movie and cannot wait for the next DCEU film."
"rohitarora-mit","6","1","3","21 November 2017"," don't listen to anyone, it's good.
","This review contains some things that might be considered minor spoilers. <br/><br/>OK. First thing first. It is not half as bad as people make it out to be. BvS was bad. Iron Man 2 and 3 were bad. Green Lantern was pathetic and so was fantastic 4. This movie is good. <br/><br/>Now to the review. I think people have made it a habit to beat the hell out of DC movies just for fun. I watched the movie and enjoyed watching it. Are there things that could have been better? Yes. But hell, if people can enjoy other superhero movies that are pure entertainment and very less in terms of storyline, why not this? Avengers was awesome but it had a very kiddish and predictable storyline too. Wonder Woman was wonderful but come on, it was no Unbreakable or Watchmen, and it wasn't supposed to be either because these movies are supposed to be fun. So, if you go there just to enjoy the movie, I think you would love it. <br/><br/>Good things about the movie - Action is good. Acting is good. Comedy is good too; they gave away all the good lines in the promos though which I think was a mistake. Batman felt like what he is - a man with no super powers but still a superhero due to his other characteristics. It felt nice because he was particularly shown to be a vulnerable character. <br/><br/>Bad things - I personally didn't like Flash and Batman's costumes much because their necks wouldn't move and it was a constant distraction. Steppenwolf's character could have been used in a better way. Sure, he was strong but also, shallow. Same thing stands for Aquaman too. Either something was really wrong with Henry Cavill's face or I had just forgotten how he looked. Will have to watch it again for that. <br/><br/>Really bad thing - I somehow don't want to see Jesse Eisenberg as Lex ever again. They should listen to the fans and just replace him. That one scene of him playing Luthor made me cringe. <br/><br/>Last, there should have been Darkseid. He should have been there, even if for just one scene. I was hoping to see him till the very last name rolled on the screen and was disappointed to see that he wasn't."

"daniel-biol","8","1","3","21 November 2017"," Nice film
","""Justice League"" is more than just a decent film regarding narrative and visuals, but definitely it is crystal clear that it was meant to be longer. Its more transparent flaw has to do with the score (little spoiler ahead): if you are going to use one of the greatest song from John Williams' great work, please Mr. Elfman, show some respect. Two little winks are not enough. If you decide to take that road, take it all.<br/><br/>""Justice League"" and ""Thor 3"" were almost delivered together. Of course, one film was not shot thinking about the other, but this coincidence forces me to say something about it. I have seen Thor last week and Justice League last night and I have to say (in front of so many reviews that goes against my feelings on this) that Justice League is far better. I almost fall asleep with Thor and its multiple bad jokes, but I was very much awake with Justice League (even with its few (mostly bad) jokes). The CGI in Thor is so bad that I cannot even believe how the same people that praise it could attack ""Attack of the Clones"" (2002!!!) and remain honest. On the other hand, even when the CGI in Justice League is far from perfection (you can see -little spoiler ahead- better fake faces in a TV commercial than one of the CGI-improved face of one the film's (Super)characters), it is very much better than what we see in Thor. So, come on!, leave aside double standards!<br/><br/>Regarding JL itself, the acting is above average: nice to see wonder woman, the batman (well done, mister Affleck, I remove my hat... again...), the Aquaman (and Mera), the flash, and (of course) the amazons. (Spoiler ahead) Superman nicely returns to save the day from a bad guy we do not know much about (the information is introduced via scenes with a Lord of the Rings tone), but first he... well, you have to see it...<br/><br/>My final recommendation: go and see the film. You will have a good time. And if you are not a fan of DC nor of Marvel and have seen Thor and you like it, you definitely are going to enjoy Justice League much more."
"rdwaltonau","8","1","3","21 November 2017"," Great Characters, Flat Plot and Villain
","After having waited forever for this movie, I was very excited to watch it. I couldn't have been disappointed with it. Even now, with the flaws it has, I am still reeling at how wonderful it is. But there are some aspects that were nagging me after the credits rolled.<br/><br/>First, the character relationships in this film were spectacular. Wonder Woman and Batman help bring together a team, with the expected turbulent rapport for each as they hit their stride, both personally and heroically. The light-hearted nature of The Flash, battling his personal demons with his father and his being thrust into a situation that is completely alien to him, are handled so precisely that he just steals every scene he is in and has the audience captivated. Aquaman and Cyborg's time on screen really brings a sense of camaraderie and team work, but from a place of hesitancy; Aquamans's from his rule of Atlantis, and Cyborg's from his new knowledge and abilities.<br/><br/>The last person to make it to the screen, which the WB did a wonderful job of hiding, was that of Superman. His return was handled terrifically. His confusion and disorientation upon resurrection. His light-hearted nature during the final fight. And the mid credit scene with the Flash. It really brings this character, who felt so alone for two previous movies, to a point where he knows he isn't alone and has others to rely on and be there for.<br/><br/>Now onto the plot. It was a quick, linear plot that didn't really have any oomph or weight to it. The final outcome wasn't really unexpected or have any consequences that would have had people truly fearing Steppenwolf. And in saying, Steppenwolf wasn't all that interesting. His confrontation with the JL seemed to be overpowered in the beginning and then laughably weak in the end. But he gave the characters something to band together for, and for that, I thank him.<br/><br/>I look forward to all the rest of the films in the DCEU with all the wonder and excitement I know that characters can invoke in all of us."

THE ONLY THING I HATED WAS THE SCORE!!!!!! Danny Elfman spoiled the movie for me. It was soooo not epic and just like marvel movies, I can't remember any memorable score in the movie unlike BvS, WW and MOS. Danny said WB shouldn't reboot old scores and reused it..

"jghetherington","5","1","3","20 November 2017"," You know you can expect better, right?
","I should have just titled this 'does it matter, people will defend it anyway'. I only wrote this review because of how much bias (and I'm not talking negative criticism here) there is for this movie. Also, to just preface, I love DC. I prefer it to Marvel, if that shuts up the fanboys. I just wanted a good movie, something I can watch again, something that actually has some devotion to the source material.... and it fails so hard. <br/><br/>Coming off of the average, slightly underwhelming, Wonder Woman, I expected a potentially good movie with Justice League. It had a bunch of my favourite characters (even Cyborg, who I always loved) and even thrown into the typical DCEU flair, it would be hard to mess up. Sadly, this just sits in the fire that is this franchise. <br/><br/>The characters themselves are fleshed out to some degree and have what may resemble arcs, but there is little room for growth. They are fun to be sure, but the moments of character growth and interaction are so forced and obvious that they feel like points on a road map, rather than a genuine and fluid change. This may be due to the 50 minutes or so of cuts taken from the movie, but it does effect the experience as a whole. The casting was well done this time however, with the likes of Aquaman, the Flash and Cyborg acting and portrayed as they should be. Outside of the CGI (which I will touch on), the costume design was something that added to the film. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, all of this feels pointless in comparison to the villain. There was nothing to note of him, to the point where he literally has no character, just a back story and some (very) flimsy motivation. Again, this may be due to the cuts, but the development of his character is nowhere to be found. Because of this it makes the character development of the actual Justice League limited, as the threat feels so extraterrestrial to the main story. The entire plot is hampered with this issue and the pacing lags massively as a result, with random exposition thrown in that just seems out of place. It's difficult to care about anything if you do not feel any sense of drama or emotional context from the movie, which this completely fails to deliver. This is tied up with how poorly the movie ends, with an obvious Deus Ex Machina that renders the whole of the movie before it moot. <br/><br/>The CGI and effects were a joke. Straight up joke. Considering other films (Iron Man in 2008 for instance) managed to outshine the CGI in this, just shows how shoddy and rushed of a job the movie is. The main villain is completely CGI (I think) and it shows, which when compared to the Heroes of the movie, it stands out in the worst way possible. This was mirrored in the handful of action scenes we actually got, with loads of slow motion drivel and poorly executed choreography that doesn't take enough advantage of the JL composition and their varying powers. It's predictable and boring. <br/><br/>The reality is, Justice League was average. Bang average. It does multiple things, some poorly and some alright, balancing the entire thing to mediocrity. This may be corrected if/when a directors cut of the full movie is released, but I'm not holding my breath. Sadly, you can see a glimpse of what looks like a fun movie underneath, but its bogged down so much that it feels as though the team behind the movie (or should I say the WB executives) didn't care and neither did I as a result. The rabid fanbase will likely defend this one and further prove that they will just take anything, which Warner Brothers is more than aware of. As a DC fan, I expect more from the movies and so should you."

"ZapJ","8","1","3","20 November 2017"," Much better than the critics think
","Saw all the bad press and went in thinking it was going to be a dog. The critics are wrong. It was a fun movie and the actors were great! Some of the CGI is a bit wonky in places, but overall good. My brother didn't know about the facial hair problem with Supes and didn't notice anything- I knew and did, but it wasn't a deal breaker. Walked out happy to have seen Justice League.<br/><br/>Now the gripes and it's all nit-picky: Ezra Miller is a good actor but they gave him too much comedy relief dialogue. He's the Flash, not the Boy Wonder. A lot of good dialogue/scenes from the previews have vanished and I did miss it/them. The lone ""family-in-peril"" was a waste of time - they added nothing and ignored others on danger. We needed more side character scenes. The Lois and Mrs. Kent scenes were good. Cyborg has/is going through a lot and his relationship with his father and who he was before the accident are given short shrift. It's there, but not enough. Barry's family life is skipped except for his dad and you can't do much more there with him in prison. We needed Iris. Jason Momoa was perfect, but the end fight should have been near water so we could really see what he can do. And if they're saving that stuff for the stand alone movies, then they should have made them first before gathering the team."
"mt-95256","7","1","3","20 November 2017"," There may be lots of flaws, but certainly not the disappointment we all dreaded. Fun characters, exciting set-pieces and a lighter tone. Very enjoyable!
","Comic book plots occasionally have a tendency to be slightly complex and convoluted - not in this film though. On the contrary, the plot here is so simplistic to the point where it isn't really important at all. The Mother Boxes are extreme McGuffins and when you think back on the film, the story isn't really what jumps out at you. In fact, more than that, the story is forgettable and just a bit dull. There are no twists or surprises or any fear or suspense at all. On top of this, there's a very confused structure, where in the first half it's as though the film can't decide whether it's about the world coping after Superman's death or if it's about Steppenwolf's plan to conquer the world. It all feels a bit mixed up and results in some scenes seeming out of place and boring in comparison, slowing down the pace of the film. It also feels as though the story was very light and we miss a middle. With a decent start and end, the middle does tend to waffle a bit; though there's a fun fight scene, there's not much else, resulting in a bit of a rush towards the finale. This is a shame as the middle section could really help us get to know the characters and give them room to grow – as well as improving the plot and giving it a chance to develop.<br/><br/>As light and dull as the story is though, the fun rarely comes from its plot; the best parts without doubt lie in its action and characters. The former, however, lacks potency because there's no threat at all within the story. Yes, the fight scenes and set pieces are amazing; there's a variety of action, well-choreographed fights and a kinetic energy (especially when all characters are working together) that brings an exciting energy to the film and is a joy to watch. However there's rarely a feeling of doom when the only vulnerable characters in any danger are a rather obscure and irrelevant Russian family as token civilians who are easily saved – no one else is ever in any peril and so the stakes really don't seem particularly high.<br/><br/>Still despite this, it really is difficult to care when the action looks this good. As with each and every Zack Snyder film, though he doesn't often make good movies, you can always count on them excelling in the eye-candy department and Justice League is no exception – this is certainly a film that deserves the full IMAX 3D experience. With impressive CGI, thrilling action set pieces and wonderful costume design (particularly for Aquaman) this is an absolute treat for the eyes and there's lots to enjoy just in aesthetics. Sadly though, it's not all good news; there are frequent scenes where the use of green screen is painfully obvious, standing out amongst all the other good CGI; and it looks like the recent controversy surrounding the more scantily clad Amazonian warriors had a right to come up – these costumes are ridiculous and nigh-on pornographic. It's a shame that while Wonder Woman took one step forward with regards to sexual equality, Justice League took two steps back.<br/><br/>Still the highlight of the film is certainly the characters. All of them mix well, their interactions together being a high point and each of them remaining unique and interesting with their own brand of comedy. I can't help but wonder how much of the lighter tone and comedic moments were down to Snyder or Whedon who completed directing Newcomers hold their own and can easily stand next to current favourite Wonder Woman. Momoa brings a comedic version of ultra- masculinity to Aquaman which fits really well and Miller's Barry Allen is certainly the comic relief that was needed in the DCEU, fully personifying all the comic book enthusiasts in the cinema and easily encouraging a whole audience to laugh. Gadot continues being perfect as Wonder Woman, bringing so much more than her beauty to the role, but being an inspirational character that stands out. Affleck seems to be more comfortable as Batman than in his previous outings and certainly shows promise. Amy Adams as Lois Lane and J.K. Simmons as Lieutenant Gordon are criminally underused considering their talents, yet despite brief appearances they make the most of their screen-time. The only weak link in the cast is Henry Cavill who still can't hold a torch to Christopher Reeve. Too dry and wooden with only a couple of facial expressions, it's a shame we've yet to see Superman develop a personality; in comparison to his fellow teammates this stands out as a stark contrast. If anything, his appearance made little difference to the story and perhaps the story would have been the same (or maybe better) without him<br/><br/>The other weak link of the film is certainly Steppenwolf, the villain. With very little character or personality, Steppenwolf here just appears as a random, generic bad guy threatening to conquer the world. His 'evil plan' is dull and simple, easily thwarted and is of very interest. Considering the roster of characters DC have at their disposal it seems strange and disappointing to have chosen this to be the Justice League's first threat.<br/><br/>Despite their recent wobbly track-record, fortunately the first live-action film of Justice League is not the disappointment so many dreaded. Leaps and bounds ahead of the first three films but certainly not as excellent as Wonder Woman, Justice League suffers from a lacklustre plot, iffy structure and painfully generic, boring villain (not to mention the Amazon costume controversy). However, luckily we have great actors playing lovable characters, wonderfully exciting and kinetic action set-pieces and a more light-hearted tone with comedic moments that gives the whole film a unique personality. Though not all critics may like this film, this is certainly a crowd-pleaser and, at last, it feels like DC are on the right track."
"pat-nicholas23","7","1","3","20 November 2017"," Good Characters; weak story; severely rushed CGI
","First the spoiler free details: I give this movie a 7 out of 10 on the basis that it is a C-grade attempt at superhero cinema. I loved the characters. I thought the growing dynamic between Bruce and Diana was perfectly in line with what they had already experienced together and where they were heading. I also believe that Bruce's lighter tone was very much a realistic portrayal. While I'd love to have seem some more aggression and darker characteristics from Batman, I think his humor was the most believable as he is making the deliberate choice to honor his promise to Superman and be a better person. With that in mind, hopefully we will see Affleck return to a darker persona in movies to come that can sprinkle in the ""gallows humor"" while also keeping Batman as an aggressive, dark figure of justice. <br/><br/>Now some of the spoilers: The Flash and Aquaman were awesome to see on the screen but not without their flaws. The Flash seemed to be nothing more to the team than a backup plan to keep civilians safe, but became completely useless to the team once Superman returned. The same cane be said for Aquaman, which felt more like a forced appearance just to set up his solo outing. While he did battle the parademons, his part in the film was largely unnecessary other than to inform Batman and Wonder Woman that Atlantis had lost its Mother Box. When its as all said and done, the plot could have been accomplished with Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and Cyborg. I do believe Cyborg was a very critical part of the story but his pain and character development took a back seat to the Flash's humor and Aquaman's screen time.<br/><br/>Superman return also felt a little cheapened. The end of BvS gave audiences hope that Superman would return on his own when the world needed him most. Instead, they repeated BvS and let Batman restore a Kryptonian in a slightly more refined method than Luthor's actions with Zod. True, Superman seems to be taking steps toward being more light and the character we all want to see, but his resurrection would have felt more pure if it was something he achieved on his own, battling his way out of the darkness (both of his backstory as well as his death) to reach the light.<br/><br/>There's also the matter of one really large pothole, which is: what happened to the Mother Boxes? We see Steppenwolf taken up into a Boom Tube, but we don't see an visual confirmation about the three boxes. Did they go through the Boom Tube as well or were they left behind for the Justice League to guard?<br/><br/>I won't even mention the poor attempts at Superman's mustache, which I hope are corrected before the DVD release of this film.<br/><br/>All in all, there were problems. But I think it was a step in the right direction. Much like with BvS, I expect to love the extended version infinitely more once we have the context of the added scenes. The cut scenes in BvS offered a lot of insight into Luthor and Batman's minds and hopefully the cut scenes in JL will do the same for characters like Cyborg.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, though, it was a fun movie and great to see all the characters together. They had a great dynamic that DC can definitely build on for future films. Their formula was very similar to Avengers, which was teach first of its kind in this genre. Had Justice League been they first, I have no doubt it would have seen a great deal of praise. Instead, it is a format we know and one we are all overly critical of now. But it leaves hope that the DCEU is moving forward. Aquaman's solo outing should be amazing and the next time these characters team up, it should play to each of their strengths. Batman as the brooding strategist, Wonder Woman as the leader, Superman as the symbol of hope, etc."
"henrylightfoot","4","1","3","20 November 2017"," More Cons Than Pros
","It's fun to see everyone together and some of the more intimate character-based scenes are nice, but far too much of this film consists of overwhelming spectacle that is undercut because of how utterly uninteresting the villain and main plot are.<br/><br/>JL deserves credit for its fights not being weightless. There is a sense of impact and the action is very loud. A few of the big sequences, particularly one involving the Amazons, even qualify as imaginative and enjoyable. Not enough, though. In Wonder Woman, the good stuff was most of the film and the underwhelming CGI boss could be overlooked. Here, the balance is flipped.<br/><br/>The good news is that Gal Gadot is still luminous as Diana and some of the newcomers (Cyborg, Flash) have readily-evident potential. The DC films could start getting better from here, or in the case of WW, get back to being good. I'm thoroughly unimpressed with this iteration of Batman, however. We knew we had it good with the Nolan trilogy, but only now do we see just how good we had it."
"darknessintheglen","8","1","3","20 November 2017"," Overall well worth watching.
","Having read/listened to many critical reviews prior to seeing this film and now having actually seen it I think its worth making the following point-in no way was this as bad as the critics suggested.Yes it was an error to portray Steppenwolf entirely via CGI.An actor with appropriate CGI support would have been so much better however it was nowhere near as bad as I was expecting.That goes for the film overall.I get the impression many critics couldn't wait to pan this film and were delighted to do so.Plot holes?Show me a superhero film that doesn't have plot holes.Thor:Ragnarok has them as does both Avengers films.In spades.Steppenwolf was a weak villain?What the hell do people think Ultron was?Dodgy CGI?Again-Ultron!(Also I think we all know Steppenwolf is just the entree for a much darker presence to come.)I enjoy the Marvel films however they have many of the same faults as this yet received nowhere near the same critical lambast.Oh well,you pays your money etc etc<br/><br/>Personally I enjoyed this and would watch it again.All of the criticisms I've read seem to me minor and if you liked it then I'd say keep on liking and to hell with the critics."
"dfranzen70","7","1","3","20 November 2017"," Justice League gets DC back on track, finally
","It's a low bar to clear, but Justice League is way better than Batman v. Superman. It's funnier, it has more action, it has less brooding and darkness, and it's just plain much, much more fun to watch. Justice League is the kind of movie that should put DC back on the same sort of cinematic path that Marvel has been treading over the past decade.<br/><br/>The movie picks up where the aforementioned Batman v. Superman left off. Superman is gone, having sacrificed himself to save the world. Meanwhile, Batman (Ben Affleck) and Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) begin to recruit an alliance of super-duper people (Flash (Ezra Miller), Cyborg (Ray Fisher), Aquaman (Jason Momoa)) to prepare for what appears to be another alien threat.<br/><br/>That alien threat is one Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds), the nephew and second-in-command to the yet-unseen super big bad named Darkseid. Steppenwolf has arrived on Earth to collect three Mother boxes – objects that, when joined together, will grant immense power, etc., etc., etc. Steppenwolf is aided by thousands and thousands of Parademons, bug-like creatures who were once men.<br/><br/>Here's a brief list of what I liked about the movie. 1) Bruce Wayne has a wry, understated sense of humor that – get this – is also self-deprecating. 2) Jason Momoa kills as a manly-man king of the seas. 3) Gal Gadot is just as terrific as she was in her own movie and in BvS. 4) The Flash is hilarious! 5) There were plenty of tight action sequences that, despite being shown in IMAX, were easy to track. I could see who was fighting whom and with what! <br/><br/>The overall tone of the movie is more in line with what Marvel's doing – there's physical fighting, there are biting remarks, there are doubts (our heroes are human-ish, after all), there are touching moments. Everyone delivers, which isn't always the case in ensemble pictures, but Affleck in particular really stepped up his game as the Bat dude. A lot of people liked his performance in BvS, but I found him stiff and boring. That's just not true in Justice League. Bats still has a huge ego, still likes to run things, likes to work alone even among his team. And he's still kind of a jerk. But he's not a boring jerk; Affleck, finally, gives him a personality! And lo! DC was saved!"
"Neonfinity","5","1","3","20 November 2017"," The best I've seen from the DCEU
","Justice League is a 2017 film directed by Zack Snyder (and partially Joss Whedon) and stars Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason, Momoa, and Ray Fisher. The film was distributed by Warner Brothers and produced by RatPac. I have seen the film during it's opening weekend and would like to present my thoughts to you.<br/><br/>After the death of Superman, Bruce Wayne (Affleck) is alerted of a plan set by Steppenwolf due to his latest encounter with an otherworldly creature. With the help of Diana Prince (Gadot), they help assemble an unlikely team of heroes to help combat his terraforming plan.<br/><br/>The League in Justice League wasn't terrible. Affleck has a really good interpretation of Batman in his hands even though he doesn't give it his all here. Gal Gadot is pretty good as Wonder Woman and the same can be said about Momoa's Aquaman character. The ones who didn't quite work for me were Ezra Miller's Flash and Cyborg as either tried to hard to make the film funny (even if some jokes do work) or just feel a little bland and angsty.<br/><br/>There was plenty of stuff I liked in JL. It runs at a decent enough pace and never bored me or angered me to the core like this year's Transformers did. And some of the concepts brought up such as Superman being evil for a short period of time and how this film portrays him as well. Though the CGI is very bad for a $300+ Million production as it looks rushed. For example, Cyborg looking like a floating head. The villain Steppenwolf was pretty bad as well and never felt like a legitimate threat once in the entire movie.<br/><br/>Justice League has a slight reference to a theme such as Superman being resurrected and how it feels to come back to life even though this film doesn't quite flesh that out. And that's really it.<br/><br/>To clarify, I am not a ""fanboy"" for either side of Marvel or DC so actual reception to the film can be somewhat difficult to come by so I'll give you this: It is an ok-ish movie. It isn't quite good, but it is not downright terrible. There is some fun time to be had with this movie, so keep that in mind.<br/><br/>Overall, I give Justice League a 5/10"
"jagbai","8","1","3","20 November 2017"," Good Fun Movie For All

This was made for teenagers, young adults. I grew up in the 80s, loved the Justice League. It was one adventure after the other. Character development was done throughout. <br/><br/>Go see the movie.

"bland-kevin67","7","1","3","19 November 2017"," Better Than Expected but too Predictable!
","I went to see this movie with the hopes for the best but expecting the worse. The acting was great but it bothered me that Superman's face seemed dirty for some reason. I found out that the actor had a mustache and it was erased by CGI in a terrible way! Not sure why they didn't just have him shave it off for a multi-million dollar movie! The build up and back story for Aqua Man, Flash and the Cyborg dude was weak and really made no sense as to why they were needed. The plot seemed to be a recycled washed up one from the Marvel Power Cube concept! I didn't have and sense of doom in this movie and, once again, the world is at stake. I really don't know how to fix these movies but I think the Genre needs to be done in a darker way and more character development. The Afleck Batman is very unconvincing to me and they need a more agile actor to play him. The battle between the movie public and the comic geeks rages on in these flicks making the movie kinda vanilla. They should have also used a real person to play the antagonist instead of a cartoon character. I have been a Superman fan all my life and still feel they aren't doing him justice in the way they portray him. The flying sequences need to be slowed down and done with wires instead of DARNED CGI all the time. Wonder Woman stole this movie and could have beaten all of the foes by herself. There is no cleverness in the script and there should have been more grounding to the story. The stand out sequence was the Amazon battle which seemed to belong to a better movie which was usurped by a committee of executives just filling in the blanks. SPOILER ALERT!! The resurrection of Superman was too fast and could have been more climactic by letting the confusion stage last longer and letting him save the crew near the end of their rope. I wish the world doom theme would be changed to something more digestible. Maybe the superhero genre is dying after almost 30 years! I hope this movie makes a lot of money and allows them to make another with lessons they've learned from this tepid movie. lastly, if I could write a script for one of these movies I would use the ""less is more"" rule. Bring down the action a notch, bring up the IQ of the movie and have a great crescendo in the end. have a few human villains involved and make the maguffin something different beside ultimate power cubes. This movie was watchable and somewhat entertaining but action without a proper plot is a waste of time. The race between Flash and Superman was also childish with failed humor and Lex Luthor is too comical to be feared. They should have added Super Girl, Green Lantern and few others in a small way then kick the butt of a clever formidable villain in cahoots with the Joker or some other human villain. To me the last great superhero movie was Watchmen!"

"gcsman","7","1","3","19 November 2017"," Part 3 of the Superman Trilogy
","Warning! MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD. So if you haven't seen the movie already, come back and read this later.<br/><br/>When I got home from the theater, my (adult) daughter who was visiting said, ""So, you went to see Wonder Woman And Her Boring Friends?"" That's one way to look at it (and she's not entirely wrong), but really folks, I thought JL was pretty good and my vote of 7/10 reflects a good-but-not-great assessment. Top rank for superhero-teamup movies in my book still goes to the first Avengers and possibly the second X-Men for their quality of characters and story.<br/><br/>JL (the movie) doesn't quite live up to the expectations generated by its huge publicity and multiple-trailer campaign, but there are a lot of good things, and a few not-so-good, that are worth saying about it. <br/><br/>(1) A workable approach to it is -- don't overthink it. On one level, it's just fun to see all these popular characters together fighting one of DC Comics' top villains. Sort of like going to see a Star Trek movie where we get to watch the familiar gang on another adventure. The plot moves along quickly with not much time given to character-driven sidelights or extensive dialog (but see below - that's both a strength and a weakness). Not overstuffed with material like BvS was. Leave it to films like Logan and Wonder Woman to achieve such quality that they leak over into the mainstream-movie world of critical acclaim -- just go and enjoy it. <br/><br/>(2) It turns out to be pretty even-handed about giving screen time to each major player: Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg, and the long-awaited (!) Superman. As expected, they each get to do their particular things in the various fight/action scenes. And riding on the runaway success of WW's own movie this past summer, even her top fans won't have too much to complain about -- she's in a whole lot of scenes and they move her character development forward a bit more. Makes you wonder what they'll do for her 2019 sequel (if indeed it's supposed to be put into the gap between World War I and the present time), but Patty Jenkins is brilliant and will pull something off. <br/><br/>(3) Now that it's out, we can finally see JL as the real Part Three of a Superman Trilogy. Big Blue is the one common factor linking Man of Steel (2013), Batman v Superman (2016), and now Justice League, and frankly it's great to see him back -- personally there's a limit to how much grim-and-gritty dystopianism I'm willing to watch. I'm a traditionalist, I like to see the good guys win, and I like to see a good guy who's just flat-out stronger than the bad guys. So now he's saved the world from super-aliens three times! The movies need Superman and his idealism connected with power in troubling times just as much as in happy times. This 3-film sequence also pretty easily fits a semi-Christian god-mythos interpretation: in Man of Steel we get his birth and life, in BvS his trial and (suitably heroic and sacrificial) death, and in JL his resurrection. Director Zack Snyder drove this in a bit more by framing him sitting in front of stained-glass windows, hanging in the sky with flying cape and outstretched arms, and so forth. But I'm not complaining. After the ending of MoS and BvS I wondered (along with other viewers) why the heck he hated Superman so much, but now I'm happy to back off a bit and give Snyder more credit for the longer view.<br/><br/>(4) For my money The Flash worked out the least well. His various one-liner quips fell flat and much of the time he was just an awkward presence. If they're going to go forward with him, the character needs rethinking. At times, the dialog wasn't any better than a decent TV show. Maybe this is an unfortunate byproduct of the patchwork way that JL had to be put together (with Zack Snyder forced to leave early because of family tragedy, and Joss Whedon coming in as a late substitute with his very different tonal style). But there's no substitute for good scriptwriting.<br/><br/>(5) The main problem with this film is that it's too short. An epic with this level of publicity buildup should have more in it. But don't stuff in more action -- what's there is plenty. Instead, what I wanted was more character interaction and especially giving more to the supporting roles (Lois, Martha, Commissioner Gordon, Silas Stone, Mera, Hippolyta, and above all the wonderful Alfred. Think about how many scenes each of them got and how brief they were!) The actors playing these roles are all first-rate, and giving them more screen time would have lifted this movie to a new level. And PS -- the Amazons once again are great!<br/><br/>(6) The several different trailers teased a LOT of scenes and dialog (as many as 10, according to Flickering Myth) that never actually appeared in the movie itself. ???!? Something's wrong here. This is the first case of misdirection-by-trailer-overload that I've experienced and I hope Warner Brothers don't do this again.<br/><br/>(7) Superman, just to drive it in, is really powerful! One scene shows him holding all the others at once to a standstill, and when he finally got the chance to nail Steppenwolf, you could just feel his punches landing like sledgehammers. If all I had were superhero films with Superman and Wonder Woman, I'd be just fine."
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","7","1","3","19 November 2017"," Not what was expected, but very good
","From the start of the DCEU more than a few negative reviews and opinions were voiced from critics and fans alike. No one seemed to accept the fact that the approach Snyder was taking was different from everything we saw so far. As a result we were served with Man of steel - a good but different take on Superman, BvS - the most bashed comic book movie that, if approached with enough knowledge and faith, really didn't deserve all that hate. It wasn't grand or superb, but it really wasn't all that bad. The two spin offs - Suicide squad suffered the same faith as BvS (with a little more right to the bashing), and the great Wonder woman. All of these movies created fertile soil for Justice league to be what it was supposed to be - a noir DC Snyder vision movie. What we got was, well, nothing special.<br/><br/>First of all, taking Whedon in was, in my opinion, a mistake. His approach is not only visible but at certain points takes over so much that Snyder's take is lost completely. As a result, the final product was more like a WB Animation DC movie but it was entertaining at it's core. Regardless of these notions, the movie doesn't have an identity crisis, it only takes a different approach to the subject at hand.<br/><br/>The editing, on the other hand was done with a hatchet. The pace, the tempo of certain sequences, the overall duration of the movie indicates that much of the movie was, brutally hacked and slashed in the editing room. Much more could have been done in regard to some characters (Aquaman and Cyborg), more was needed in the villain history and motives department, but most of all the Lois Lane - Superman segment was by far the most underwritten segment of the movie. Just by viewing all of the segments where Lois Lane, Martha Kent and Superman are together make no sense and have no real impact. It's point can be found, but much of this story line was cut and we were presented with just a subatomic fragment of what that story could have been. So, that part really is the weakest part of the movie.<br/><br/>The thing that makes every DCEU movie really magnificent is it's approach to the question of humanity and the question - what makes us human. These segments are extremely philosophical and not everyone's cup of tea, but they make DCEU movies relevant and they give them depth. Justice league has some inclination of those questions and deals with those issues, but not in a way we are used to. The Cyborg segment is rushed and underdeveloped. It feels that the actor and Snyder wanted to say much more but were restricted in many ways. Aquaman has more than one segment in which he shows his (meta)human side, but is shortened and lacks that real emotional and philosophical kick. The Flash is by far the fan favorite of the movie. He is funny, childish, chatty and has a way of voicing what everyone is thinking at that time. In comparison to the Flash TV series, this is what Flash is supposed to be like. After this movie, everyone is actually looking forward to seeing where these characters will go, and how they will evolve. On the other side, Batman was different. He is still the much needed darkness incarnated, but he has heart. The full scale darkness form BvS is gone (for better or worse), and he shows much more humanity than in the previous version. Regarding that was where the character was going all along, especially after ""the Martha scene"" (where Superman gives Batman back his humanity), this take on Batman was a logical step. Affleck unfortunately does not work so well as a flawed and human substitute leader, as much as he worked as the brutal and hardcore Dark knight, so maybe certain changes could be done in the future, making him a bit more like in BvS. The solo movie about Batman that is coming really needs a long and hard consideration on how to approach the character.<br/><br/>The music was an absolute marvel. Danny Elfman was the right choice. His insertion of the 1989 Batman theme not only sparkled childish emotions, it gave Affleck's Batman a whole new dimension and utmost respect must be shown for the work Elfman has done in this movie.<br/><br/>All in all, Justice league strays far from it's predecessors, in some cases too far. In certain areas it is rushed, in others it is edited terribly. Some segments have no idea if they are Snyder or Whedon, some need more potency. But, the actors pulled the best they could and their depiction of the iconic DC characters is by far the best we have ever seen in live action movies. The music is playful and childlike amusing with just the right amount of serious and dark notes that follow every scene perfectly. The humor is well placed and implemented correctly (unlike the last Thor movie) and serves the movie in just the right way giving the DCEU a note to follow in the future.<br/><br/>It is not the Justice League we wanted, it is not what was intended, it is, not by a long shot, what these characters deserve, but it is fun and entertaining. Unfortunately, it is very forgettable, despite it's opening sequence (a masterful depiction of a world without hope that sticks with you long after the movie ends), but especially because we are all looking forward to the movie in which Deathstroke and Luthor with a league of their own go up against the Justice league."
"t_knox","5","1","3","19 November 2017"," Another DC effort dogged by overused, sub par CGI and obvious re-shoots
","The film's intentions are clearly good, with Ben Affleck's Batman trying to assemble some kind of union among the people with abilities of which he learned in BBS, however the very first scene - Batman taking on a petty criminal and then a 'para-demon' - betrays the actual legacy this film will leave: very bad, unrealistic CGI and poor dialogue to match. The opening shots look just like a video game - even the backdrop of Gotham looks blatantly computer generated, and badly too. This scene is a sign of things to come, because for the majority of the film most of the effects and CGI are really disappointing, reminding one far too much of the messy, dark and incoherent Batman vs Superman, and the third act of an otherwise good looking Wonderwoman solo outing. Affleck and Gadot make a good go at injecting charisma into it, but with Ray Fisher's Cyborg being about as one-dimensional and dull as possible, and Jason Momoa's Aquaman clearly suffering from extensive re-shoots - allegedly ordered by WB themselves - limiting his story and actual time with the team, as well as JK Simmons' and Jeremy Irons' very limited screen time in favour of a CGI mess of a villain in Steppenwolf, the movie's flow and actual story and enjoyability suffers heavily. Justice League is a messy attempt, and certainly not the answer to DC's prayers, let's just hold out hope for The Batman and Aquaman films finally rewarding the loyal fans, because this newest DCEU instalment misses the mark in so many areas and leaves a lot to be desired."
"ghastingevans","8","1","3","19 November 2017"," Best Ensemble Super Hero Movie to Date!
","So I'll start off with saying I am primarily a Marvel fan more than DC. Spiderman followed by the X men are my favourite super heroes.<br/><br/>DC has produced by a distance the best DCU film to date and in my opinion the best ensemble Super Hero movie from any studio. By ensemble I mean cast of Heroes from individual properties rather than a team (so not Watchmen, X men, GotG etc).<br/><br/>The pacing is possibly a little fast but draws you in. Nearly every hero gets a character arc (though Wonder Woman's is kind of tacked on and Aquaman doesn't get one). Steppenwolf actually carries a threat to our heroes (a real issue with all 3 Avengers films, yes 3 calling an Avengers film a Captain America film doesn't stop it being an Avengers film).<br/><br/>The action is great. The acting is solid the characters have chemistry and the humour hits the spot without becoming force (unlike Marvel films of late). Each Characters special powers feel different and each gets a chance to shine.<br/><br/>Affleck is really making a claim to knock Heaton off his perch as best Batman (though Bale still claims top spot of making the best Batman films).<br/><br/>I really don't understand the negative reviews compared to other films in the same genre. This film is objectively better than Wonder Woman in every way and easily ahead of the first 2 Avengers films. This also marks the continuation of DC films moving in the right direction and hopefully they will continue. The negative reviews of this films coupled with the positive reviews of Marvel films that are heading in the wrong direction is just damaging the future of Super Hero films. <br/><br/>Disney could learn from DC and their willingness to take risks with characters and plot for the good of the story (even when those risks don't work out like the endless dreams within dreams that ruined BvS). Hopefully Infinity War will take Marvel in a new direction though Civil War and this year's Marvel offerings have me very worried. <br/><br/>However anyone that enjoys good comic book movies should watch Justice League. It has great entertainment and has me excited to see what they do with Darkseid going forward."

","So, does this new DC Comics' installment win a place among the best comic-book movies ever? No, not even close. However, it does reach the expectations I had and it even surpasses them in some aspects. It is a good film but it is not great.<br/><br/>Then, what does work? Undoubtedly, the cast is the standout of the whole show. The league's chemistry is palpable and genuinely entertaining, which definitely elevates every single character. I love that all of them are lighthearted and humorous, instead of being overdramatic, dark and depressing.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck continues to be a true badass as Batman / Bruce Wayne. I was always a fan of his work, but when the news of him being cast as one of the most popular superheroes of all-time were released, I was part of the people that doubted that choice. However, I was the first to admit that I was wrong when BvS came out and he was one of the few positives of the entire movie. Once again, he delivers a fantastic performance and Batman has some awesome scenes, as always.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot as Diana Price / Wonder Woman might be my favorite casting choice of these last few years. It is mind-blowing how one actress can dignify a single character so damn much. Her dedicated and heartfelt display completely astounds me and she is able to turn Wonder Woman into one of my favorite superheroes of today. Even if her lines are sometimes cheesy and shallow, Gadot deals with it in a flawless fashion.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller is probably going to be the audience's preference due to his witty moments as Barry Allen / The Flash. He definitely captures the character's spirit, The Flash has the funniest lines and his sequences are really well shot. Jason Momoa is freaking awesome as Arthur Curry / Aquaman and his action scenes are even more badass. Finally, Ray Fisher is great as Victor Stone / Cyborg, the most intriguing character of the film, even though he is 95% CGI.<br/><br/>Yet, this is where problems start to rise. I didn't write much about these last three characters because there are quite few development scenes. The set-ups for each of these superheroes are so swift and insignificant that I can't really care for any of them. What is supposed to be an origin movie for each one, that is simplified in one or two lines, especially with The Flash.<br/><br/>There is a reason why The Avengers is, still to this day, one of the best comic-book movies ever created. Marvel spent 5 years setting up and developing each of their main heroes, so when the time arrived to unite them, every fan knew who each superhero was and most importantly, everyone was already connected with them. Still, even with all of this preparation, the runtime for this huge blockbuster is 142 minutes.<br/><br/>Justice League is only 110 minutes long and it needs to set up 3 new characters, a villain and a whole story where they all need to come together as a team. Obviously, something is going to go wrong and that is almost everything plot-related. The pacing and tone are out of control, some of the editing feels uncommonly choppy and the script for each character sometimes falls in the ""silly"" territory.<br/><br/>In case you don't know about this, Snyder had to step down from the production due to family-related issues, so Joss Whedon replaced him for a while. It still feels very much like a Snyder film, but with all of the re-shoots, some scenes feel like a different film or they don't seem to have a connection to the prior moments (Whedon unquestionably removed and added some stuff).<br/><br/>With the unbalanced pacing and some messy plot points (isolated scenes), the movie's overall flow breaks and it is brought down. These are some of the reasons behind the choppy editing, so I look forward to an extended edition because I truly think they can improve both the story (more time for character development) and the technical details (natural flow between scenes).<br/><br/>Similarly to pretty much almost every superhero film, my main issue with the movie is, as you presumably guessed by now, the villain. Steppenwolf is just a giant CGI beast that wants to conquer the world because ""darkness, yeah"". He is as dull and fake as it could be. There is absolutely no attempt at developing him, he is simply a plot device to cause our heroes to assemble and fight him together. Awful. Just horrible.<br/><br/>Despite all of these flaws, Justice League also has a lot of positives and there is no denying it. It is a much more entertaining and cheerful film than its predecessors, so there are more than reasons for everyone to spend a good time at the theater. The action set pieces are phenomenal, the third act might be heavy on CGI, but it is extremely well managed and it doesn't feel video game-ish as in WW.<br/><br/>The score is pretty neat and it conducts the action excellently. The ending is near perfect, in my opinion. For the first time, I can finally say that Superman is awesome! They finally got the character right, he is the untarnished standout of the third act with some epic moments spread by astonishing fighting scenes. And yes, Henri Cavill is exceptional, even though his digitally-removed mustache doesn't escape anyone's eyes.<br/><br/>To summarise, Justice League is clearly a step in the right direction. It has a lot of technical issues with its pacing, tone and screenplay that mess up the movie's overall flow and editing, but the big problem is undoubtedly the lack of depth in the new characters, villain included. Nevertheless, the cast's chemistry is as entertaining and funny as the characters they portray, being Gadot, Affleck and Miller the standouts, while Superman steals the show in the end. Some fantastic action sequences, a cool soundtrack and an incredibly satisfying ending (plus two awesome post-credits scenes) prove that DCEU just started to roll up its sleeves!<br/><br/><ul><li>MSB Reviews - if you enjoy this review, please follow my blog :)</li></ul>"
"namsu-89683","Null","1","3","18 November 2017"," Great but a little rushed
","Really enjoyed this but ending felt a little quick to wrap things up. I did notice what might be a goof. The janitor at star labs I.D badge changes between scenes and doesn't resemble him in the first shot of him asking about the scientists early finish. Overall the movie was great, Plenty of laughing points and action. The scene from the trailer of Alfred and an unknown person approaching him that he was warned about prior didn't appear?"
"agriffiths-83279","7","1","3","18 November 2017"," Pretty good film, with a few issues
","I saw Justice League yesterday, and I enjoyed it. The chemistry between the heroes was excellent, the action was good, and there were several funny scenes that kept the mood light.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>Gal Gadot was wonderful, as always, in her role as Wonder Woman. I won't give it away, but I will say that her first scene is spectacular, and she gets even better as the movie goes on.<br/><br/>Ray Fisher was great as Cyborg. He is both mysterious and cool at the same time. From his very first scene, you really feel for his character because of his situation.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa and Ezra Miller stole the show as Aquaman and The Flash. These two generate more laughs than almost anyone else in the movie. I'm so pleased that they are part of the team.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck was okay as Batman, but I really don't understand why he was even in this movie. Sure, he has all the cool tech and wears a cool suit, but he seems to spend most of his time running from the bad guys instead of fighting them. I can remember only one scene when he actually had a gun in his hand. Aside from that, he spends most of the fight scenes fleeing. That was a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>Henry Cavill was great as Superman. He's only in a few scenes, but what great scenes those are! It was good to see him alive again.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>Steppenwolf was a huge disappointment as a villain. I think they wanted him to be a menacing monster, but he came across as almost laughable. Whenever he mentioned the ""mother boxes"" I started cracking up. I think they could have solved part of the problem by renaming the ""mother boxes."" I don't know who thought it was a good idea to name the artifacts that. It was absurd.<br/><br/>The next problem is Steppenwolf's first scene. It is so clearly copied from The Avengers that it almost seems like outright plagiarism. It was also annoying because, in effect, I already knew what the outcome of the scene would be, having already seen The Avengers. I would have liked for DC to have come up with something original for this part.<br/><br/>An additional minor problem is that the movie didn't really have enough time to explain some of the character's backstories. There were a lot of questions and minor plot points that never did quite get explained. Perhaps these will be filled in by subsequent movies. It also may be that, since I didn't see Man of Steel or Batman v Superman, I just didn't have the context.<br/><br/>Final comments:<br/><br/>All in all, I think this was a good movie. It wasn't perfect, certainly not the best superhero movie out there, but I enjoyed it and plan on seeing it again. I might bring a friend next time too. I look forward to where the DC story line will be heading in the future!"
"damian_hockey","7","1","3","18 November 2017"," Justice league. It's the start of something.
","Justice league review. Basically DCs Age of ultron. SPOILER FREE<br/><br/>So before I begin the review I will admit I am a DC collector. But I will not let this create an unbiased review.<br/><br/>So we begin. This movie is Warner Brothers DC fourth installment.<br/><br/>With a very rounded cast this movie throws many punches and very rarely misses the mark.<br/><br/>Cast and Characters.<br/><br/>Once again Ben Afleck is the ever Gothic dark Knight himself Batman. Bringing the bruding dark and gritty character to life. Once again Ben Afleck shows why he is the perfect batman.<br/><br/>Gal Gabot. The ever beautiful and fierce wonder woman the God killer is back and ready to do battle. And she is on amazing form once again showing her strong and bringing new light to a character that deserves limelight in the DC universe. Gal Gabot is utterly amazing.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller. Sadly Ezra is certainly a weaker leak in the Justice league movie. Portraying Barry Allen aka the flash as a timid and shy character who has social problems. And sadly this is certainly not a good portrayal of the character from the comics of a character who has always been seen as chatty and charismatic.<br/><br/>Ray Fisher. His first ever appearance as cyborg. Sadly he does not receive enough screen time despite being one of the more intriguing characters out of the DC universe. But Ray Fisher plays cyborg as close as possible to the comic.<br/><br/>Jason Mamoa. Finally we come to the Aquamans first trip to the silver screen. And how brilliant it is. Bringing a new gritty brilliance with an early 2000s feel to Aquamans character. Mamoa certainly plays Aquaman as very boystress and playful and makes me want to see far more of him in the future in DC films.<br/><br/>Henry Cavil. Once again he plays the brilliant boy scout Cark Kent - Superman. I don't have very much to say on his character as he is just superman all over. Again a very good performance. <br/><br/>Story<br/><br/>The movie follows one or more of the many stories in the DC comics universe but sadly has me asking a lot of questions to why they added certain elements or why there are so many plot holes in this movie. Although not a perfect story with obvious re-writes it still makes for a very entertaining story line with plenty of fun elements throughout creating some amazing character interaction moments and bringing a certainly lighter atmosphere to the DC universe which has very much been needed.<br/><br/>Soundtrack.<br/><br/>Wow. Just wow. This soundtrack is brilliant in so many ways. Throughout this movie I was actually giddy. I can't say anything without spoiling it. But I certainly Sat with a smile on my face as a score would roar up. <br/><br/>Special effects and CGI<br/><br/>OK so this was one of the more disappointing moments for the movie. The CGI certainly isn't bad by any means. But it was used far more than required and the movie sadly suffers from it. It feels unnecessary for certain elements of the movie such as the batmobile and other parts of the film.<br/><br/>All in all DCs Justice League is a very fun and enjoyable film with some flaws which if were fixed could have made this film brilliant. I also highly recommend staying right to the end of the movie for the post credits. One being a major nod back to a very famous DC comic and the other being mind blowingly awesome to an DC fan boys out there<br/><br/>My final score for Justice League is a 7/10"
"beware_of_the_werewolf15","8","1","3","18 November 2017"," A Very Decent Movie
","Like most DC movies, this film has been getting a lot of hate from critics. The funny thing is, the complaints it is getting are some of the same exact things you see in other films of this genre, but for some reason those films get a pass. The cgi is actually pretty good, and just as great as the other popular superhero films you have seen. This villain is pretty generic though, which can be frustrating. He is just there to set up even more of the universe and provide a glimpse of the new gods. So he was effective in that sense. He is just like a normal superhero villain though (like a regular one you see in the MCU). Honestly, this movie is very similar to other team up superhero films, and should probably get the same scores as those films, but for some weird reason it isn't. The characters were great, every single one. The humor can be a bit much at times, but I found myself laughing a few times. There was quite a bit of fun action too. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie is too short. WB wanted to cut down this film by a lot, and it shows. Most scenes feel like there was probably originally more to them, so hopefully we get an extended cut for Justice League as it definitely needs one. The soundtrack is also pretty generic, but I guess that's what you get when you get rid of Hans and Junkie XL. Danny Elfman scored a pretty bland, generic, un-epic soundtrack for Justice League, and that is really disappointing. Even though this movie had some obvious flaws, there weren't more than most superhero movies that have come out (and for some weird reason get a ton of praise). So I say watch this film. It's definitely worth the watch, and is quite entertaining. And I can promise you that each hero is, well, pretty heroic and definitely fun."
"thewaqarjamil","7","1","3","18 November 2017"," Was a good enjoyable movie...
","It was a good movie. If only WB hadn't interfere with forcing to reduce the run-time to less than 2 hours and Joss re-shooting and changing a large portion of the story, it would have been an awesome product but still it was a good enjoyable movie. Zack's way of storytelling is quite unique and good because his movies have a sense of reality in them and i wish we would be able to get the original cut of the movie which Zack had made. I genuinely loved his Man of Steel and BvS.﻿"
"vivek-nair","7","1","3","18 November 2017"," Justice League - around the corner
","Justice League-a high anticipated movie, thought to be one who will take the DCEU further after the success of Wonder Woman, does wonders, but only for the things that happened at the cutting floor (read Joss Whedon). The following review contains spoilers. <br/><br/>The film begins with Superman talking about hope. Then switches to a robbery being observed by batman who uses the robber as a bait to draw a para-demon, well that's one of the few scenes where we see Batman actually engaging in a hand to hand combat. What follows is a fast paced plot beginning from Wonder Woman foiling a bomb blast to Aquaman refusing to join the team to Flash's recruitment to Aquaman being motivated by Mera to join the team to Superman's resurrection to Steppenwolf boom-tubing at random ease & collecting the mother boxes & setting up his base in Russia for his wicked plan of Unity & he shown as being eaten by Para- demons for his 'fear' & the League posing for a group photo at the activity landscape, the movie rolls its credits. <br/><br/>What works in the movie are the central characters; Gal easing into the shoes of Wonder Woman; Ben portraying a tired, 'I've seen lot of s**t' Batman who's been fighting for 20 years; Ezra Miller as a nomad, fan boy & 'I am new to this kind of world Flash; Ray Fisher as a confused metal man still trying to cope with what he has become (didn't notice anyone using the word cyborg throughout the movie & so was the word flash); Arthur Curry as a the narcissistic Aquaman & Henry Cavill as Kal-El, a troubled man who is coming to terms with being back to the land of the living. I am not mentioning Steppenwolf as one of the central characters because the dude was hardly there in the movie. <br/><br/>What doesn't work in the characters' department are the under- utilization of the likes of Alfred, James Gordon & Mera, sure there are lot of characters & not everyone can be given a lot of screen time but given the fact that the movie is just 120 minutes, the movie goers would not have cared much to sit for another 30 minutes. <br/><br/>The Plot-Steppenwolf wants the 3 mother boxes to bring out his plan of converting the earth (what is with these guys? General Zod wanted Krypton on earth in Man of Steel, now this guy). They say, since Superman's death, the earthlings have succumbed to fear, sensing this Steppenwolf & his minions comes to earth to collect the mother boxes. First one at Themyscira, the Amazons couldn't defend, the second at Atlantis, Atlanteans fail to protect it, & the third one at Silas Stone's house, the bloody conqueror can't figure out where the third mother box is hence forced to kidnap a bunch of people to torture them to say where it is (he is poor that way, can't see things hidden in a house), the team rescues them. Then out of desperation Batman suggests resurrecting Superman to give people hope, rest of the team disagrees, but still they proceed in bringing him back. Kal-El is confused & is provoked by Metal Man's automatic self-defense mechanism. The team then makes a failed attempt to tame Superman - shown to be remorseless in using his powers at league. That scene where the flash just runs & sees Superman can SEE HIM run, Flash is petrified to the core, the dude is not used to people seeing him run like that, & this is happening when Aquaman, Wonder Woman & Metal Man are going full throttle holding Superman down, was one of the very few praise worthy scenes. Batman gets a taste of his 'Do you bleed?!' when Superman tosses him over from few feet above the ground. Lois Lane appears & bring Superman back to HIS life. The league then makes an attempt to stop Steppenwolf without Superman in the team. The team is beaten and flying comes Superman some action here & there, & boom!! The villain is supposedly dead & back at his home. The world is saved! Booyah! <br/><br/>There is no much action in the movie, if this is a competition to Avengers, they should have brought in a lot of action. <br/><br/>The CGI department, is not bad at all, except for Superman's face at close up. Real close, it makes you cringe. Other than this, nothing wrong in the CGI. <br/><br/>Humor was in bits & pieces, some had to be paid real close attention, maximum credit in goes to Alfred Pennyworth, Flash & Wonder Woman in that order. <br/><br/>Green Lantern Corps are shown in the movie when they fought the war with the Atlanteans, Amazons & Humans. <br/><br/>Somewhere I feel that Joss Whedon did damage to the movie more than he could revive it. There are sudden cuts in the movie, abrupt endings to a scene, new scene introduced without a justified flow & few scenes missing from the original trailer when Zack Snyder was at the helm. <br/><br/>Broken screenplay, decent cinematography, a slightly messed up plot & a weak villain, the central characters holding onto the movie with their lasso or pitchfork or speed force is what drives the movie. <br/><br/>Background score was mediocre to low, again has to be blamed on Joss Whedon for firing Junkie XL, being replaced by Danny Elfman.<br/><br/>There was no edge of the seat scenes, no adrenaline gushing either. One of the climax scenes shows Bruce planning to covert the Wayne Manor to the JL headquarters with Diana hinting of new recruits. <br/><br/>I would recommend watching this movie with no big expectations in mind, had Zack been at the helm I am forced to believe that the outcome would have been a different & positive one. I hope to see an Ultimate Edition/Director's Cut."
"Nixon_Carmichael","Null","1","3","18 November 2017"," Yet another movie coldy ripped from the hands of the director and turned into a mess.
","After having seen Justice League twice, I've concluded two things:<br/><br/>1. There is just enough here to like.<br/><br/>2. There is a good movie in here somewhere.<br/><br/>A tell-tale sign that this movie was yanked away from Zack Snyder long ago is that even in the late stage marketing material, most of what was shown in the trailers did not end up in the movie. <br/><br/>Also, one can tell that the extensive reshoots lead to an exorbitant Whedonization of the film.<br/><br/>It is a fun flick overall, but I prefer the BVS directors cut. Here's hoping they do one for JL."
"TheSecondMan","7","1","3","18 November 2017"," An enjoyable flick!
","Justice League is an enjoyable flick. It's more dark than the marvel movies but is way more lighter than BVS. So it's actually quite fun. <br/><br/>Aquaman, The Flash and Cyborg are all great. They are introduced pretty good despite the fact that we have never seen them before. My personal favorite has to be Flash.<br/><br/>The action is also pretty good, but I got a bit tired of all the slow motion. I also kinda felt that the fight scenes with Batman was a bit slow/clunky but that might just be me.<br/><br/>All in all it's pretty enjoyable. It starts really dark but gets gradually lighter and is really fun in the end. So if you like superhero movies I would recommend taking a look.<br/><br/>7/10"
"bankofmarquis","7","1","3","18 November 2017"," Could have used a better villain
","I have been one of the few people in this world that actually, kind of, enjoyed the ""dark universe"" that Zack Snyder has created with the DC Universe entries MAN OF STEEL and BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE.  The biggest criticism that has been lain at the feet of these films is that they are ""too dark"", so with the recent WONDER WOMAN entry, the balance between seriousness and ""some"" humor seemed to be achieved.<br/><br/>And...with JUSTICE LEAGUE...the balance continues to be well served - at least as far as tone goes.  Director Snyder has figured out where the line needs to be for this sort of thing to make events serious and dark while punctuated with humor.  He also has the good fortune of populating his world with a cadre of characters that are fun to watch on screen.<br/><br/>And, that's where this film has some problems.  It suffers from the hurriedness of getting to the JUSTICE LEAGUE film and skip the ""intro films"" of some of these characters.  Both AQUAMAN (Jason Momoa) and THE FLASH (Ezra Miller) were interesting characters and, I think, more background/depth to them would have added to the film.  Adding these two to Ben Affleck's BATMAN, Henry Cavill's SUPERMAN and, especially, Gal Gadot's WONDER WOMAN make for an interesting group, indeed - only Ray Fisher's CYBORG was rather bland on the screen, but that just might be the fault of the character, not the actor (kind of like Jeremy Renner's HAWKEYE in the AVENGERS films).<br/><br/>Add to these are some fine actors - Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons, Billy Cruddup, Connie Nielsen, Diane Lane, JK Simmons, etc..) who are putting in Supporting Cameos to further the plot with some very good - if not spectacular - special effects and there is plenty to watch on screen.<br/><br/>The problem with this film is the plot and the villain - neither of which are particularly interesting, nor up to the challenge of challenging the JUSTICE LEAGUE, so we devolve, by the end into ""punchy, punchy"" action sequence with no real satisfying conclusion.  <br/><br/>My hope for this Universe is more ""stand alone"" films (especially for THE FLASH and AQUAMAN) and the promise of what the opponent the next JUSTICE LEAGUE film will bring to the battle (as seen through the end of credits scene).<br/><br/>I'll come back for more.<br/><br/>Letter Grade:  ""B""<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
"umashankarpati1997","9","1","3","18 November 2017"," Love it or hate it, JUSTICE LEAGUE is one of the fascinating piece of filmmaking.
","It's the cinematic version of a page-turner, akin to feverishly flipping through the pages of a newly purchased and highly anticipated comic book issue so that, before you know it, you've already consumed the whole thing before your parents' car pulls into the driveway, just in time to start over and read it again. Justice League simultaneously feels like a solid live- action version of some of best moments from the excellent animated series of the same name. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck continues to be a better Batman and Bruce Wayne them people want to give him credit for, and this is the closest we've seen him to true blue Batman after the murder rage of Batman v Superman. Henry Cavill is without a doubt the best he's ever been allowed to be as the Man of Steel, refreshingly sunny and earnestly heroic. He feels like classic Superman. Wonder Woman is both a clutch player and a joy of the film thanks to Gal Gadot and her irrepressible on-screen spark.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller did a great Job as flash. Ezra's turn as the flash will no doubt earn a legion of fans, he's endearing in his innocence and gets the bulk of the good one-liners Cyborg was good and aquaman was just splendid. His dialogue delivery, his attitude were amazing. Each character gets moments to shine and make a positive lasting impression. There are some cons in the movie like the re shoots were clearly visible in Superman's mustache removal. The CGI at some parts were in necessarily excess like the last flight, CGI on Steppenwolf was not that good but Ciaran Hinds did a great job as Steppenwolf. But this film is a fascinating one, an entertaining one, and often, a fun one. Give it a try if you are avid CBM fan."

","For those who loathe Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, and they are legion, Justice League will be just the corrective followup they're looking for. The scenes of the League members together, bickering and bonding, spike the film with humor and genuine feeling, creating a rooting interest in the audience. Without it, the film would crumble. The addition of Ezra Miller as 'The Flash' was a great thing as he was maintaining the balance between action & some comic sequences. The CGI was good with enough good sound editing.

","First things first- Ignore the critics. They are totally biased against DCEU. Guys, most of you watched Thor: Ragnarok. Do you really think a movie gets a 94% rating based on comedy and better visuals? This is absolutely crazy. We all know that with Rotten Tomatoes. The more money that studios pay critics to say kind things about their horrid slop the worse the movie is. Critics supporting Disney/Marvel as usual. 90+% RT rating? Sheesh!<br/><br/>Let's talk about the movie. I watched JL in IMAX 3D with Laser and it was mind-blowing. This resulted in images not that sharp but projected by Dual Projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX (no cuts in the screen at all!), along with 12000 watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand each time you see action! <br/><br/>Let us discuss what I liked and disliked:<br/><br/>+ The Bat-crawler <br/><br/>+ WW entry in the movie<br/><br/>+ Bat-suit upgrade <br/><br/>+ Victor Stone: The best side actor <br/><br/>+ An improvement from Henry Cavill. <br/><br/>+ Actors gelling as one cohesive unit. <br/><br/>+ Hats off to Synder for not giving up on the project despite family issues.<br/><br/>+ I liked that this movie connected to Batman V.

","I read some reviews of this movie prior to seeing it. Many reviewers ripped it for sub-par CGI (computer graphics). Some focused on the overall story being thin. Others commented that they felt it was disjointed, plodding, and uninspired. After seeing the movie I can say... those critics are correct, but I still liked this movie overall. Some of the Justice League cast gave rock solid, bordering on inspired performances! Ezra Miller, who plays the Flash is not good, he's great! He's quirky and geeky, vulnerable, and funny. Jason Momoa is also pretty good as Aquaman. I'm not thrilled with the scripts personification of him as a kinda muscle head, surfer dude, God of water, whatever, but what the guy is given to work with, he does a good job of pulling it off. Gal Gadot is great (as usual), but her star power diminishes a lot when she becomes just one of the gang. The Cyborg character is a throw-a-way. Maybe he needs more of his back story to be revealed to flesh him out (no pun intended), but I just wasn't feeling him. As for Batfleck... Somewhere Christian Bale is crying in his old bat cape. Ben...hang up the cowl son. You're too old, and nearly talented enough to pull off Batman. The movie did reach a point for me, where I wondered if it would be redeemable at all, and then something happened. Almost like when Kirk Gibson limped to the plate on two bad legs in the 1988 World Series, and hit one of the greatest WS home runs in history, Justice League found it's heart! I still have issues with some of the story. For instance, there are inconsistencies with the previous film (don't want to divulge and ruin the movie for ya), but I can let those things go. I left the theater with mostly positive feelings about this one, flaws and all."
"AudreyAwesome","7","1","3","18 November 2017"," A Good movie with flaws
","So, let me start off saying that I do like all of the DCEU movies in their own way. I don't really care what critics have to say, I just make my own view. As I have written in other reviews, my favorite of the DCEU is Man of Steel, but I appreciate all of them.<br/><br/>Also, in regards to Marvel, I also like some of those movies. I didn't like Guardians of the Galaxy 2 or Spiderman Homecoming, I really thought Justice League was better, but Thor: Ragnarok takes the spot for the best comic book movie of the year. Don't let it deter you from seeing this one though, as Justice League is still good!<br/><br/>For this movie I will give the good and the bad:<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>1. The Characters. Wonder Woman and Batman are great, as usual. The Flash is funny and Aquaman is awesome. Can't wait for his movie. Cyborg is interesting. A character who will not be named is great as well. They all work really well together and really make this movie special. <br/><br/>2. Comic book moments. There are a lot of good comic book moments to like here. The references are good. I think an improvement that they made was the actual comic book type stuff as this wasn't as apparent in Batman V. Superman<br/><br/>3. The ships. I ship Diana and Bruce together. They obviously dropped a lot of hints that I really dug. Can't wait until the ship has finally sailed. I ship Lois and Clarke obviously. A bit disappointing, but I liked what I got.<br/><br/>4. The continuity. I liked that this movie connected to Batman V. Superman. In a lot of ways, this is the third movie in a trilogy. While you will feel like you are missing some things, there is some continuation here.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>1. The plot. There is really not much to see here. <br/><br/>2. The villain. Very weak villain. No high stakes. It also felt like he was delivering his lines to a green screen instead of to the Justice League.<br/><br/>3. The CGI. Probably the worst of the negatives. Everything was CGI'd. The worst would probably be SteppenWolf. Why did he look like that? <br/><br/>4. Bad editing. Man, this movie was all over the place. There was one scene that really irked me. Wonder Woman was wearing her costume and she walks in the next shot with something else on. When did that happen? lol. <br/><br/>5. Many scenes in the trailers not in the movie. I am sure we will get an extended cut, which I am eagerly awaiting. It felt like a good 30 minutes was probably cut and I'm sad that we didn't see it. Can't wait for the Blu-ray.<br/><br/>6. The music. What I liked about the other DCEU movies was the soundtrack. This movie didn't really have anything memorable with sound except the song in the credits. I missed that about BvS and Man of Steel. DC, please fix for other movies!<br/><br/>Overall, if you are a fan of comics or the other movies, go see it. It is a fun time, which is what people expect from something like this. One thing, before I am done, is that I wanted to comment on the DCEU, in general. Yes, they have received poor critical reception, with Wonder Woman having great reception, and this movie is no different. However, we can't really judge this movie now, because this movie was already done with and shot. The real course correction won't happen until Aquaman. In fact, Justice League was shot before Wonder Woman and spent a long time in post production. There really wasn't much they could do. I will say that there are some changes in here that will show the better movies to come.<br/><br/>Also, this is not the real ""Justice League"" movie. Everyone knows that. The real one will come when Justice League 2 happens. I do believe that DC knows how to fix their issues (CGI may take some time) but I am hopeful. This movie does show that there is a bright future. Go see it.<br/><br/>My DCEU ranking:<br/><br/>Man of Steel Wonder Woman Batman V. Superman/ Justice League (tied with BVS) Suicide Squad"
"tyson-hunsaker","6","1","3","17 November 2017"," A messy and incoherent strain peppered with wonderful golden moments.
","""Justice League"" is the latest addition to the DCEU and marks a cinematic landmark as the first time we've seen particular DC characters like Aquaman, Cyborg, and Flash. The film picks up where ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" left off. With the death of Superman, the world continues to mourn while Batman and Wonder Woman assemble the Justice League to defend the world against Steppenwolf; an alien villain set on destroying the world. <br/><br/>""Justice League"" had enormous pressure riding on its shoulders as a follow up to this year's ""Wonder Woman"" and its behind the scenes problems with director Zack Snyder stepping down earlier on in the film's post production phase. Faced with multiple reshoots and a new approach by Joss Whedon, ""Justice League"" feels wildly inconsistent and unfocused in both plot and central theme. The first half of the film feels so jarring and all over the place no scene seems to mean anything to it's accompanying scene. The story attempts to balance several elements from the DC comics lore that it manages to make it feel more meaningless than satisfying for a true fan. This is obviously disappointing since I thought most DCEU films so far have done that quite well.<br/><br/>Since the first half and the second half of the film feel so disjointed and uncomplimentary, the pacing feels down right painful. This bogs the story down almost as much as the villain Steppenwolf who not only feels cliché, he's actually blatantly bad. Many are complaining about the CGI being subpar for the villain. I would argue the actual character design and construct are so generic and video game-esque, that it's not really fun watching him on screen. <br/><br/>Complaints aside, ""Justice League"" has some fine, memorable moments and qualities. First, the portrayals of all members of the league and their characterization was very satisfying. Ezra Miller stole the show as The Flash and Jason Mamoa as Aquaman was compelling to watch the entire time. Both Ben Affleck and Henry Cavil give quite different representations of the DC comic's heavyweights which I still have mixed feels about. Despite hesitations however, every character worked well with each other and it was truly entertaining to see every scene they were in. <br/><br/>Recently, a large glaring issue with these genre films many have had is its tone. Recently, many audiences have preferred more lighthearted, fun, and humorous approach to the superhero/action genre. Films that make fun of the dramatic and cheesy nature that correlates with the genre stories. Sacrificing genuine emotional drama for a jokey one-liner, modern day superhero films have lowered their stakes, minimized the impact of their villains, and filled the screen with more clever one-liners than ever before. In the case for ""Justice League"" the movie falls right into that trap by fitting the mold and not standing out. Regarding Warner Bros and DC comics films, I enjoy and appreciate a film that tries to be more. With big characters come heavy ideas rooted in mythology and ancient storytelling. Perhaps the biggest complaint about ""Justice League"" is its resolve to appeal to mass audiences with more jokes and low stakes; even if it means it being forgotten in a few months. Say what you will about previous DCEU films but at least people still remember them.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, ""Justice League"" is a good time. I would eventually recommend going to see it. It beats other comic book films this year but doesn't come close to touching some of the best. It's fun, riveting to watch for the characters, and definitely peaks my interest for the future of the DCEU. It would really be best to see this one on your own and form your own opinion."
"antoniol2979","7","1","3","17 November 2017"," Justice League fun but flawed
","Heres the deal I had fun with this movie but it took nearly half the movie to get me there.I'd say the first 45 minutes was frustrating.It felt very choppy and rushed and it was annoying me.Besides a couple of good scenes those first 45 minutes were pretty awful.This is a film run by 2 different people and it shows one half is really bad and the other half is great.The 2nd half of the film is really fun,the humor starts to hit the character interactions and their beliefs in certain situations were engaging and interesting and the movie began to flow better as a film and by the end I had fun with it.The characters, the actual members of the Justice League are great and by the end they did feel like a team.Steppenwolf on the other hand is terrible with little to no motive as to why he is doing what he is doing.But in the end the last hour and 15 of the movie redeems the terrible first 45 minutes but you can't ignore the problems it has."
"caravindan1994","9","1","3","17 November 2017"," The Superman we all needed
","Zack Snyder definitely directed this brilliantly, just that we caught only glimpses of it since close to 30 minutes of the movie being cut out. This is a surely terrific movie and all the actors were great.<br/><br/>Other than the obvious cuts, the only negative thing I have to say is the background score. If it was Hans I definitely would have given it a 10. Man Of Steel and Batman V Superman standout for their background score we could remember what happened in the movie by just hearing it. It definitely was bad here.<br/><br/>Now Superman in this movie is definitely the best one you would have seen till date. His portrayal in the first fight once he's back, that was epic visualization by the crew right there.<br/><br/>A tease to Flashpoint and much more has been given in this movie.

"sanjidparvez","8","1","3","17 November 2017"," Whedon saved it! Flawed but entertaining.
","JUSTICE LEAGUE isn't a perfect superhero movie. One dimensional-weak villain, rush in the story line, almost zero emphasis on how's the world dealing with the events...there are issues to get critical about it. But does that really means it's another entertaining mess of a DC film?! I definitely wouldn't call it a mess but yeah..still it was damn entertaining!! It's basically a superhero movie mostly about the superheros, from character introductions to all the fun & actions, JL was a triumph of DC's supreme superheros. The entertainment level was so high that all those critical issues didn't actually bothered me much; the heroes steals the show entirely, the villain & the crisis felt like minor issues or an excuse to bringing them all together. All the actors shines in their respective roles; Miller surprised me as Barry Allen, Jason Momoa was great & badass as Aquaman, even Ray Fisher as Cyborg was pretty adequately fits into the group. WW & Batsy have grown with their characters and man...Sup returned as the best of them, one of the versions of Superman that we've been waiting for. If you are familiar with the style & execution of Snyder & Whedon's filmmaking then I'm sure you'll see the difference here, the style of 2 different directors were somewhat quite visible throughout the movie but in a good way. In Justice League, we have somewhat got the best of both of them. I'm glad Whedon stepped in & saved the movie from being another Snyder's signature entertaining mess. His light & full of life & fun touches were noticeable and made this such an enjoyable ride from start to finish despite having several issues.<br/><br/>DCEU still alive and I'm looking forward to see further installments."
"joelhbk","8","1","3","17 November 2017"," Much better than y'all hearing
","Im gonna drop the negatives now so I can progress from then on. Movie should've been at least 20 minutes longer so it would paced more comfortably. The CGI could've been much better. <br/><br/>Now, the good stuff. Humor felt natural, not forced. Each character shines. They all have their moment. Few nods for doe hard fans but the story itself wasn't hard to follow if your a casual moviegoer. World just keeps expanding exquisitely. Everything that had to do with superman was beautiful. While the plot and narrative was simple it still have its smart writing moments. They didn't downplayed Barry Allen's brilliance to make it just comedic relief. And even cyborg who's the less known character was presented and developed in a fairly complete and satisfying way. Gal is delightful. In the end, the movie it's fun but it doesn't compromise storytelling to force humor or lightheartedness. Seems like critic wanted to hate it no matter what it was like. Judge it for yourself"
"noah52697","1","1","3","16 November 2017"," Justice League
","Is Justice League the Holy Grail of DC movies that we've been craving? No. Is it better than Wonder Woman? No. Is it terrible? NO. Is it good? YES. Justice League is a very flawed, but very fun and entertaining movie. If you are a DC or comic book fan, you will have a smile on your face the whole time, guarantee. Everyone in the movie gives their A- Game: Ben Affleck once again nails Batman, Gal Gadot is amazing as Wonder Woman, Ray Fisher was surprisingly good as Cyborg, Jason Momoa was awesome as Aquaman, Ezra Miller has made the Flash his own and is good in his role. Even the side characters give their A-Game, with J.K. Simmons playing Commissioner Gordon, Amy Adams as Lois, Diane Lane as Martha, etc. Henry Cavill makes a great return, BUT there is something about him that will definitely be noticeable, as the CG for his mustache is sometimes hilariously bad. And thus we get into the negatives of the film, and there are plenty. The pacing for the most part, is off-centered. Everything feels rushed as we snap from character to character from place to place, it's hard to feel connected when you barely have enough to process what the hell just happened. It does feel as though large chunks of the movie were cut and placed on the sidelines, no doubt because WB wanted a movie under 2 hours. The CG sometimes can be pretty bad, the mustache-gate is one clear example, and might take you out of the experience. The villain is also pretty weak, as we don't spend enough time with him to really care about his motives. Also, because of this rushed pacing, moments happen in the film that should be cause for applause, but in the end feels a bit unwelcomed and weird. But do these negatives detract from the film as a whole? Yes, but only slightly, as the positives are able to outwit most of the negatives. The action is fun, exciting, and full on amazing to watch unfold on screen. The character interactions are also perfect and are exactly what you would expect from a screenwriter of likes of Joss Whedon. Also...DANNY ELFMAN should be commemorated for his work on Justice League as his score is able to fit things from old DC and new DC while also making it his own. In the end, Justice League might leave some disappointed with its flaws and rushed pacing, but I feel most will appreciate this movie for what it is: THE KICKSTART OF THE DCEU. I'm excited to see where they go from here, but until then I'll watch it, then watch it again."

","I cannot rate this movie lower than this, otherwise I would. I don't understand where that $300M budget was spent. As promising the first trailer was, the theatrical cut proved to be a garbage mixture of DC Characters and Marvel Tone. Joss Whedon and Reshoots are clearly the reason of why this movie was so bad. So bad that it made me cry. If you look at the reshoot scenes, The dialogues given to these DC Characters are very similar to their similar ego in MCU. Batman was talking like IronMan. Aquaman was Thor. Flash was Spiderman and Superman was treated like Captain America. I am 100% sure this was not Snyder's vision at all. Shame on WarnerBros for letting this crapshow run in cinemas. I don't understand why this movie was given a Green Signal after the final product. Release the Snydercut because that's what DC Fans really deserve."

","Though, it's worth noting Justice League deserves credit for cutting down its run-time to 120 minutes precise, so there's no overuse of length of boredom to tire the audience to death, but this movie still suffers from multiple errors. There is plenty of room for character introductions, but Justice League suffers ludicrously from lengthy, obscure dialogue - mainly from the Flash - but one might argue the problematic misuse of this is due to writing issues of the movie. Like previous instalments: Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice and Man of Steel, Justice League - amongst the front runners in the DCEU - continue to suffer from poor direction. Plus, Diane Lane's brief presence as Martha Kent is weaker than ever, following her weak portrayal in Batman V Superman and Man of Steel. I believe her weak portrayal in these movies is the error of the writers. Arguably, one might expect to see the return of Kevin Costner and Russel Crowe, in their respective roles as Clarke's biological and earth fathers. Plus, Superman's return is nothing exciting, nor is the brief portrayal of Henry Cavill, which is a large step back from his portrayal in the previous movies. Though, the visual effects are mediocre and decent, there is enough writing errors to go around here that puts the movie down. Considering its poor box-office performance so far, it's errors and financial performance may very well affect the rest of the DCEU."

","Initial previews for DC's Justice League would suggest that, while maintaining the murky swamp water aesthetic of Suicide Squad, the film seemed to opt for a lighter tone than 2016's hilariously serious Batman v Superman, which didn't make it seem refreshing so much as it seemed to be aping Marvel even harder than before.<br/><br/>And then, just to solidify that the DC Extended Universe is its own unique thing that takes zero cues from the Marvel franchise, director Zack Snyder let Avengers director Joss Whedon take over at virtually the last second, as reshoots were happening and someone cranked the color saturation to give the slightest impression that this grim-looking film is indeed a light-hearted teamwork story complete with a faceless alien horde to defeat. Oh and there are post-credit scenes now!<br/><br/>Of course, the main differentiation from Marvel is that, whereas The Avengers finally united our favorite heroes from past adventures, this one is a union between our favorite DCEU cameos, some surly bat, and Wonder Woman. We meet Bruce Wayne/Batman (Ben Affleck), the caped billionaire tech genius who unites the team; Barry Allen/The Flash (Ezra Miller), the super-fast youngster; Aquaman (Jason Momoa), the Atlantean trident-wielder; Cyborg (Ray Fisher), the cyborg; and Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), the Amazonian demigoddess. There's also Amy Adams' Lois Lane because where would these saps be without her?<br/><br/>Superman also returns (no longer shunned), back from his death at the hands of Doomsday in the last film, and as a testament to the quantity of hoot given by all parties involved: Henry Cavill didn't want to shave his moustache for the Whedon reshoots, hence it had to be erased digitally in post, as even the biggest newbie when it comes to spotting CGI will notice. Note: in the age of online hype and clickbait, this is hardly a spoiler. I shan't apologize.<br/><br/>Our villain is the enraged Steppenwolf (CiriÃ¡n Hinds), who once before descended to Earth with hopes to recreate it through the use of so-called Mother Boxes, only to be overcome by the Atlanteans, Wonder Women and Green Lanterns of the era (all this is explained in an expository scene that doesn't remotely resemble Lord of the Rings). He is also connected to a future, even greater villain named Darkseid, in that he is the latter's uncle. It's always funny when dark alien overlords have perfectly conventional familial relationships and related terms. Uncle Steppenwolf is coming over, darling!<br/><br/>I am being harsh but I did appreciate some things: the casting of J.K. Simmons as the new Commissioner Gordon was welcome and Jeremy Irons still delivers one of the more interesting renditions of Alfred in Batman movie history. There exist true moments of chemistry between our heroes as well, certain characters are still likeable (e.g. Flash and Wonder Woman), composer Danny Elfman brings something sweet to the table, and in true Zack Snyder fashion, slow-motion is never used as shoddily as it could have been.<br/><br/>Still, the fact that this is a re-shot and carelessly stitched-together piece of work is all too apparent. I wasn't too comforted by the visual effects or action scenes either; it's the usual PS4 gameplay footage posing as live-action cinema. With actors who wouldn't shave, directors being switched out at bad times, and editing that doesn't allow for the best of flow, the circumstances were just too unkind for Justice League.<br/><br/>Is there yet hope for the Extended Universe? Well, some critics actually do see promise for the future, welcome the brief runtime of what could have been a truly tedious origin story, and are happy about the decreased self-seriousness of it all (even if such scenes still remain, as when the opening sequence compares humanity's grief over Superman to Prince, Bowie and Leonard Cohen). If they recover from the underwhelming box office numbers, DC might just get a new chance. So say the reviews I have thus far read and so it may be.<br/><br/>But sure, the critics are still being paid off by Marvel to write deliberately biased reviews and make DC look inferior. That's why it is Warner Bros. that partially owns Rotten Tomatoes and not Disney, right? That's why even people like me, who don't get paid for doing this and just enjoy writing film reviews, also agree that these are poorly planned and (usually) incompetent movies, right? Feel free to hit me up."
"dp-17275","3","2","12","22 March 2019"," Horrible
","Before we begin, this movie is horrible, there. Zack Snyder or Joss Whedon's 'Justice League' is the ultimate build up to the 6 heroes coming together, 3 of which were set up, the other 3 not at all. The characters relationships work, however that's the only thing that works in this dumpster fire. Aquaman is a bland character and is very unlikable anytime he is on screen, to make up for this he makes jokes that don't land and does some 'badass' stuff, like hitting the cgi villian Steppenwolf. Batman does a complete 360 and changes from a brooding dark basically murderous vigilante to a jokey Tony Stark type figure. It doesn't help that Ben Affleck looks barely awake throughout the course of this film. Wonder Woman is just as boring and 1 dimensional as she was in 2016's 'Dawn of Justice' with only her solo movie providing any reason to care, the countless references to Steve Trevor annoyingly remind us that we could be watching a better movie. Ezra Miller's the Flash is an attempt to recreate essentially Spider-man, removing any intelligence that the character previously had, in place for a quirky, constantly messing up Flash, purely for comedic relief. Cyborg is bland and one of the few interesting characters that the movie refuses to explore. The film has awful writing with jokes that almost never land, and a plot that is so generic and straightforward that it just makes you realize the best thing about this movie. It's so straightforward and generic that you can watch it as just a dumb superhero popcorn flick. This film is unintentionally funny, and looks ugly compared to Snyder's usual beautiful style, the CGI is awful with some shots I can compare to that of the Injustice games and the main villain Steppenwolf who appears as a PlayStation character. The effects are awful, references to Wonder Woman that are shoehorned in, no consistency in this cinematic universe, and a film ugly to look at. However this film is dumb-fun and feels like a Saturday morning cartoon special and I had fun watching it."

","After being in the minority and loving Man of Steel & Batman v Superman but not enjoying Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman this film just came across as completely different and actually quite boring.<br/><br/>Pros -<br/><br/>Ben Affleck as The Batman is just a genius move. I love him. He is my Batman, shame he didn't get a warehouse sequence in the movie but he is my Batman. He deserves to stay the longest in the Universe and needs his own film trilogy. Amazing. Some scenes of The Batman just turned me into a six year old kid.<br/><br/>Henry Cavill is just as good and I have such a soft spot for him as Superman.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa is a brilliant move by DC to play Aquaman and he shines in his role even if he isn't given as much to do as the other players.<br/><br/>Ray Fisher I loved as Cyborg, he brought humanity and depth and fully deserves a solo movie, or even a Teen Titans movie.<br/><br/>Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf I thought was actually pretty good. Whilst the CGI is a mess at times, the character was developed, motives explained and he was quite intimidating. Honestly don't understand the hate for him, commendable job by Hinds to create this character.<br/><br/>The supporting cast of Amy Adams, Jeremy Irons, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, J.K Simmons, Amber Heard, Joe Morton, Michael McElhatton, Billy Crudup, Jesse Eisenberg and Joe Manganiello are such talents and all shine whether they are given less or more to do. Props to Amy Adams for always bringing her A game along with Lane and Irons.<br/><br/>Pacing was actually good although I fully believe they should cut out all the scenes with that stupid Russian family and fleshed out the major players a lot more. That Russian family really annoyed me.<br/><br/>Some of the set pieces with the Amazons and the Lord of the Rings esque battle were a joy to watch. Shame we didn't get to see more of David Thewlis as Ares as again with the minority here, loved him.<br/><br/>The end credits scene turned me (yet again) into a six year old kid. I just love Deathstroke.<br/><br/>Some moments of humour worked but in many scenes just felt cringey.<br/><br/>There are some references which are quite fan pleasing such as the name dropping of Roman Sionis, the showing of Green Lanterns and of course the end credits scenes.<br/><br/>Cons -<br/><br/>Gal Gadot I hate. I'm sorry, there's nothing about her I like, I didn't enjoy her in her film. She just can't. And it bothers me. And I'm sorry but I just don't like her at all.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller was good in most parts but some of his humour was very hit and miss.<br/><br/>The CGI was actually not as bad as people are making out but seriously a lot more could've been practical. Henry Cavill's CGI face isn't in the movie as much as I thought he would be which is very good.<br/><br/>The Russian family should've been ditched for more character development, character's that actually mattered. I really hated them.<br/><br/>This film is actually at times quite boring and without any stakes unlike the previous films.<br/><br/>I absolutely hate the comedic and light hearted tone of this film. BvS and MOS all were perfect in my eyes in terms of tone whilst SS and WW had more conventional terms which worked. This film just doesn't fit in THE DCEU.<br/><br/>(Update) - I completely forget about Danny Elfman's score which really explains how flippin forgettable it was. JUNKIE XL PLEASE COME BACK.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon's fingerprints are all over this film and the reshoots are so painfully obvious. Give us the Snyder cut we deserve. The action was actually quite boring and uninspiring. Stick to TV Whedon.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if I got a different cut of the film but the opening with the CGI Superman filmed on a phone was legitimately weird.<br/><br/>Look overall this film just isn't Zack Snyder's movie, I for one love his stylistic vision and storytelling, MOS and BVS are in my eyes masterpieces that the critics tore for unnecessary reasons. I am a huge Marvel fan as well and it's hard not to draw comparisons with this film and The Avengers. Whedon's touch is all over this film and honestly he could possibly have tarnished the entire DCEU with this installment. If this film was in Snyder's hands it would be more visually fantastic, longer and have real stakes. The rumours of Whedon shooting 20% of this film has to be fake, his fingerprints are all over this decaying body of work which sadly falls flat from previous entries in the DCEU.<br/><br/>Pray for The Snyder Cut."

","It's amazing, how DC Movies fell from the altar of standards, since the Dark Knight. There is an interesting movie under the rubble, on the joint effort of different personalities and the resurrection of a fallen hero. But this is a film, which has been sacrificed for the constraints of time, the frenetic pace, the easy joke, the forced copy of the competition formula. Factors that prevented the narrative from this film to breathe, stupefying the purposes of the different characters, as if the ""story"" was cooked by too many hands, preventing it from flowing naturally. And yes, the CGI effects are under-cooked too often. And one has to wonder whether the re-shoots were worth it. If the resources, would not have been better used to polish the technical aspects of this film, than to pursue the magic sauce of levity. We will never know, without basis for comparison. Still, there are good moments in this film. The team works well together. There is a visible and pleasant chemistry between the characters. Cyborg was the most pleasant surprise, the comedian flash was funny most of the time, and the Grunge Aquaman was more than eye candy.Batman and Wonder Woman are the pillars of this story. And Superman. not because of the actor's fault, incorporates the best and worst of this film. For every good moment, follows visual noise or narrative inconsistency. In short, if you want to see superheroes fighting, or making meaningless jokes, this movie was made for you. If you belong to a more demanding audience, there is a lot in this movie that leaves some bitter taste in the mouth. Personally I liked the characters, the cinematography (mostly). Did not like: The story, The frenetic pacing, fuzzy special effects. Squeezing all this together. I give 6.5 points out of 10"
"e-m-hobo","6","1","4","23 September 2019"," Officially I'd rather give it 5.5/10 stars
","It wasn't the kind of superhero movie that makes use of the additional time a feature length movie offers to delve deeper into the characters, their backgrounds, how they feel, and what motivates them. That basically makes this one made for the special effects.<br/><br/>The main problem I have with it is that it all feels very Deus Ex Machina and largely functional with very little actual struggle in terms of how they actually defeat the bad guy. It reminded me quite a bit of how I learned to control my nightmares as a kid: I always dug up magical potions that made me infinitely strong and threw all of the nasties over the mountains that scared me. This movie is sort of like that and mostly functional in the way it was conceived.<br/><br/>It needs more character struggle and there hardly was any. Also, the fun friendly race at the end doesn't receive an ending, so we don't see who crosses the finish line first, and we should've seen that after the credits rolled, instead of something else."

Answer's right here.
This film is soo bad, it made me hate DC comics itself for days. It has so many flaws that one can analyze and compile a book named ""HOW NOT TO RUIN A FRANCHISE""
Right from the fact that WB wanted to try MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE formula to executives letting this one slip onto theatre screens with dozens of facts making this a huge waste of time, money and talents makes it all less worthy of one's time. This one jist repeats the fact that WB has no idea as to what to do with comics book characters and stories. It doesn't even need to establish a subsidiary, it jist needs a dedicated team to handle films parallel to its mainframe. Its actually funny to see how DCEU fans still try to defend this by pleading everyone associated with this project as innocent.
Not enough screentime, less energetic performances, creepy CGI, no actual villainy from the so-called big baddy, Aquaman being useless, Batman completely derailed coz of tone down, Superman's pale and uninteresting resurrection, not quite the Justice League one would wanna remember and Joss-edited blunder and on and on and on.
Don't waste time on this one, read comics instead."

","After 'Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice,' DC fans (and non fans) were depressed by the sheer agony. Personally, I was a little afraid for the future of DC's franchise. After an audience gets a bad taste in their mouth, it's hard to forget. But, 'Justice League' actually comes though with just enough action and fun to make up for previous mistakes.<br/><br/>In the film, we are introduced to more heroes, like Cyborg, The Flash, and Aquaman, as well as reuniting with familiars like Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. As I said before, it is a fun film, but has a few ""flaws"" in my opinion. First, even though there are many heroes, only Superman has died and the whole world falls apart? Sounds like Bruce and Diana aren't doing their jobs! And Aquaman is a little too cocky to be taken seriously; it takes from the drama. Cyborg is the best character because he is calm, level headed, and not annoying.<br/><br/>But, I must say I enjoyed the theater experience and it's worth your movie-watching time. The visuals are spectacular and not too cheesy, and the action is quite ""edge of your seat."" If you are afraid you're in for another 'Batman vs. Superman,' don't be. It really makes you look forward to the upcoming DC films, like 'Aquaman' and 'Justice League II.' Also, it is not necessary to have seen any previous DC films like 'B vs. S' or 'Wonder Woman.' All you need know is that Superman has died. But I do believe this movie was released at the wrong time. It premiered in November 2017. A superhero epic like this didn't deserve a release in dreary November! A June, July, or August ""summer blockbuster"" release would have suited it better.<br/><br/>So, if you see 'Justice League,' you will not be disappointed!"

","$300 million was spent on this. All the good $300 million could have done, and Warner Bros. threw it at Joss Whedon, who took over after fellow hack Zack Snyder dropped out after the loss of his daughter (he is credited as the director as he helmed the principal photography). Warners turning to Whedon to complete a film featuring Wonder Woman after he was blasted on social media when his rejected Wonder Woman script was leaked unto an undeserving world was an irony lost on them, I'm sure. <br/><br/>The beef I have with superhero movies (aside from idiot studio execs throwing hundreds of millions of dollars at hacks) is NONE of them are faithful to the original origin story: the Kents adopted baby Kal-El from an orphanage; Diana competed against the other Amazons to become Wonder Woman; Bruce Wayne saw a bat come through his window as he was brooding in his study. Here, Snyder and Whedon ""outdo"" themselves by trashing not one but two superheroes: Aquaman is now a tatted-up boozer who can't communicate with fish, and The Flash is now a whiny Soy Boy who exclaims ""Oh, snap!"" And like the rotten cherry on top, the Villain has an Oedipus Complex!<br/><br/>Then, there are the plot holes. Yeah, a superhero movie just isn't a superhero movie without tons of plot holes. But Whedon and co-hack Chris Terrio (who won an Oscar; how in God's Name did THAT happen?!) seem to take a perverted delight in trying to out dumb-and-dumber Snyder: God-awful CGI; slow-motion sequences which will make you beg to be waterboarded; ripping off nearly every Si-Fi film from the past 20 years (""The Matrix"", ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Thor""). Barry and Victor exhume Clark's grave in the dead of night? Superman has memory loss after being brought back to life? The henchmen of The Villain With The Oedipus Complex tear through Russia, but can't tear the salt box a family lives in to shreds? Did The Villain With The Oedipus Complex set up shop at a defunct nuclear reactor in Russia so that the little girl who lived in the salt box could play with a flower on a radioactive LSD trip? Makes as much ""sense"" as anything else in this tripe!<br/><br/>But the real crime against humanity is Dumb and Dumber wasting the charged chemistry Ben Affleck and Gal Godot unleashed in ""Batman v Superman"". I was anticipating Batman and Wonder Woman hooking up (or realizing they are soulmates, at the very least), but in ""Justice League"", they act as though they hardly know each other -- and don't want to!<br/><br/>Seeing how Whedon has made a second ""career"" out of his seething hatred of Trump, I'm surprised he didn't manage to shoehorn some jabs at Agent Orange. Perhaps he did, but his overlords decided that was a Bridge To Nowhere Too Far (Walter Chaw of Film Freak Central opines Snyder's ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman v Superman"" predicted the Trump presidency, but he gives Snyder way-too much credit for brains AND talent!).<br/><br/>At any rate, I don't blame Whedon (or Snyder) for this as much as I blame Affleck, who has managed to do the impossible: make George Clooney the second-worst Batman ever! One of the producers, Affleck hired Terrio to write ""Argo"", for which Terrio won an Oscar (how in God's Name did THAT happen?!); no doubt, he convinced Warners to tap Terrio to pen ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman v Superman"". After the $75 million Warners had to eat when Affleck's opus ""Live by Night"" arrived in D.O.A., why the former Mr. Jennifer Garner hasn't been tarred, feathered, and run out on a rail is beyond me!<br/><br/>As Shakespeare would have put it, this ""is a tale, told by an idiot (in this case, three idiots), full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"".<br/><br/>That whirring sound you hear are the Warner Brothers spinning in their graves!"

","A middling feature by the usually good Joss Whedon Justice League is an average film that suffers from pacing issues and the fact that it follows Nolan's Batman series. A lot of focus was placed on Ben Affleck, but he is a surprisingly good Batman facing Henry Cavill's Superman in a match up that doesn't really do justice to both the characters and the fans. Justice League is too expensive and, in your face, to be an after thought and too bloated to be considered a good film. Average at best."

Of the heroes, my favorite is Ezra Miller, who plays a very funny, very geeky Flash. And Gal Gadot is still a terrific Wonder Woman. I'm less enthralled by the rest of the cast - I found Affleck pretty bland after Bale's Batman and I can't get excited about Aquaman.<br/><br/>There's plenty of solid action, fancy special effects, and witty dialogue. The pace is quick, although sometimes rushed, and the story is solid even if bits of it feel a little tacked on.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect movie, but it's a decidedly enjoyable one, and a huge leap up from BvS.

Some of it looks more like a video game. I know about the unmustaching but it's not obvious on a smaller TV. Something is fake about his face but there is a lot that looks fake in this movie. The storytelling is jumpy and doesn't really flow. The villain is one dimensional at best and lacks any compelling characteristics. As for the JL members, they are generally good with the most glaring problem coming from Batman himself. For some reason, he has turned quippy which doesn't fit this version of Batman. Flash is a lonely nerd somewhere on the spectrum. I don't mind that but they don't expand on it. Wonder Woman is wonderful and she has some of the better emotional moments with the other members. Cyborg is a fine addition. Aquaman is a great character but his story probably has some stuff cut from the movie. Hopefully, his movie will expand on that. I do like this more than BvS.

Human deaths are treated with a slightly more delicate touch like horses falling on them... seriously.<br/><br/>Funny thing, most criticism of the film has focused on lack of character development, disconnect between the tone of Superman-Lois storyline and the flash-bang conflict, the pathetic chemistry between Batman and Wonder Woman, and also those misogynistic Amazon costumers (seriously? were you expecting them to become Quakers as penance for Affleck the allegations that Affleck acted like most heterosexual men do around women who inventory their visual attractiveness as a major assets). In those departments, actually, the deficiencies of Justice League have been greatly exaggerated. The team members are certainly flushed out just as well as Hawkeye and Black Widow (and arguably the Hulk 3.0) were in Avengers. The flash is there for comic relief. Aqua-man, unexpectedly, is the bad ass. And Cyborg brings the deep thinking, tech-wielding ""mysterious"" element to the team. Batman is unlikable enough after the pile on that followed the death of superman. Wonder woman delivers the kind of impossible girl-power feats that 21st century would appear to be demanding in terms of equality (basically she's been promoted to Superman level power, but Superman has gotten a promotion himself, leaving the comic glass ceiling in-tact) so that progressive mom's bringing their little girls to the film will leave with smiled on their faces. Criticism in those departments is just the Hollywood press and bloggers drinking their own Kool-aid.<br/><br/>The movie is vastly superior to anything put out in the Avengers franchise in years -- which were little more than attempts to serialize the infinity stone story line that has gotten about as compelling as a buddy movies starring Jason, Freddy and Jaws. Should Aquaman or Flash have gotten a stand along film before JL the same way Ant-Man got his own film? There are very strong arguments against that approach, given that characters like Ant-Man or Rocket Racoon are so obscure that there is immense freedom in a solo film that just wouldn't be there for Flash or Aquaman. I think given the poor box office of JL, we can kiss the possibility of stand along post-JL movies for Aquaman or Flash goodbye. Which is a real shame because a shirtless bad-boy Jason Momoa could have provided the necessary quid pro quo of sexual objectification that women are ostensibly clamoring for from Hollywood. And a film starring dorky Ezra Miller could have been service-ably enough loaded with cougar bait."
"redkrypto-16659","1","1","4","2 December 2017"," So much potential, so disappointing.
","Where do I even begin... Superman is literally the World's FIRST superhero and should therefore be treated with a little respect, this movie FAILED miserably at doing even that. From the opening scene which is supposedly filmed from the perspective of kids shooting foootage of Superman on their cel phones, this is a joke. First, for continuity sake when the hell did this happen? The Superman portrayed in the footage certainly wasn't the one that was in Man of Steel or BvS developmental-wise. Second, Henry Cavill looks like a morphed freak. YES, everything you have heard about how bad the mustache removal was is true. I had seen some screen shots on-line and they were so bad I thought they must have been a joke... they were not. If WB reeeeaallly wanted Joss Whedon to revamp this movie THAT bad then they should have at least paid for the effects! So, from the opening scene you are put in the mood that this is gonna be bad. Now, I will say that there were moments that you could tell were Snyder's, and they walked right up to the edge of greatness and then instead of blowing our minds, were ruined by some obvious Whedon BS one- liner which was intended to lighten the tone for us stupid masses. They just destroyed every potential character beat that otherwise would have put a chill down every fan-boy and girl's spine. I contemplated my one star and even slept on it but as much as I wanted to love this movie I just can't. I, in fact have decided to convince myself that this never happened. Let me go on... Super- breath!! Superman freezing Steppenwolf's axe so WW could shatter it with her sword!? That power just doesn't translate to the big screen, it's cheesy and didn't even work in Superman II. How about Superman calling Flash a slow poke or literally picking up an entire apartment building full of people intact! Physically, that isn't even possible... the friggin' building would fall apart, unless of course the construction in cold war Russia was just that awesome that this is possible. Just so much potential but with just so many STUPID Whedon moments sprinkled in to destroy the tone altogether. JW and WB made the entire JL into a laughingstock. This is so sad really. Another issue is the soundtrack... remember how badass it was when we met WW in BvS? Batman is about to get wasted by Doomsday and WW jumps in with the help of an incredible soundtrack and you see and feel that you just witnessed something really cool. This movie lacked any moment like that at all. The musical choices were terrible. I have liked Danny Elfman in the past but this shouldn't have been his movie. The opening Batman sequence on the rooftop left me expecting Michael Keaton to pop out and say ""I'm Batman."" Remember that moment in the trailer when Alfred says ""he said you'd come"" and everyone was like ""who the heck is it?"" Superman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter?? That scene wasn't even in this cut. Lets not forget that the JLA came before the Avengers. Thanos was an admitted rip-off from DC. Jack Kirby's Fourth World was beyond the imaginations of anyone else in the industry. All of these characters deserved so much more. The moments were there, the casting was great, I liked every character and you could see the potential screaming to be let out. WB is just so short-sighted. They failed to have faith in us, the consumers and fans, that we could see Snyder's trilogy to its conclusion. Instead they saw an opportunity with Snyder's personal tragedy and called in the Marvel-boy to turn this in to the Avengers. The problem is that it was intended to be better, to have deeper themes, than anything ever seen over at Marvel. WB lost faith in us the fans and they suck for it. This cut of the movie will never be on my shelf, after this review I'll stop tracking its box office, or any news about it, I just don't give a sh*t anymore. Sorry to ramble on but it hurts to get a glimpse of what could have been great and then see it so clearly taken away. It is easy to tell every scene that Whedon re-shot because Superman's face looks jacked-up, and every scene was disappointing. My guess is that there was going to be some really cool stuff happen when he came back but now you can't even tell what was going to be, it's so diluted. BTW - I don't think Superman's first reaction when coming back would be to rip the JL a new one! Oh man, where are the writers of the death and Life of Superman of the '90's? We needed your talent and respect for the character now more than ever. They treated that story with such respect that I have been collecting ever since. So devastating to see the characters you have devoted so much time and energy into be treated like this. Don't waste your time with this movie. Lets just hope that the greedy execs at WB release the Snyder cut either in theaters or on blu-ray... that is our last hope. I think that the probability is high because if the footage already exists they will surely want to profit from it. Otherwise, great job Joss Whedon for destroying the Superman franchise and taking is backwards 30 years in maturity. Super-freezing breath, picking up entire buildings, telling jokes in the middle of literally everything. Goober-faced Superman. No depth. Wrong music. I give up."

","My son and I thoroughly enjoyed Justice League. The movie features impressive visuals, a seemingly unstoppable villain, terrific action scenes as well as an entertaining team dynamics,. Batman is spot on, Wonder Woman is outstanding, Aquaman is rugged and mysterious, the Flash is likable and funny, and Cyborg is a tragic figure. Last but not least, the return of Superman for the first time makes one no longer long for Christopher Reeve's legendary portrayal. What an amazing movie! We are going to see it again this weekend."
"tavm","9","1","4","28 November 2017"," Justice League is quite an awesome ride for the first in the DC superhero group series
","Last year, I compared the Marvel movie-Captain America: Civil War-with the DC one-Superman vs. Batman: Dawn of Justice-and I considered the Marvel one better. This time having previously watched the Marvel one-Thor: Ragnarok-and then the DC one-this one-I'm considering the DC one better mainly based on more action and possibly also more heroes. Besides Batman and Wonder Woman, there are also Cyborg, Aquaman, and The Flash (By the way, I can't help thinking he's being written and played in the form of the Spider-Man character in the recent Marvel movies: that of a teen/young adult in over his head but with great enthusiasm) . Oh, and one more but that may be considered a spoiler. Oh, wait, I put the warning in my review so here it is: Superman comes back to life! Anyway, this was quite an awesome ride that I just watched with my movie theatre working-friend who had watched before and was also enamored with it enough to agree with me of it being better than the Thor one. So that's a high recommendation for Justice League. P.S. I noticed that besides Ben Affleck (Batman) who previously played Daredevil, another player who previously appeared in a Marvel movie was J. K. Simmons (Commissioner Jim Gordon here) who was J. Jonah Jameson in the first three Spider-Man movies that starred Tobey Maguire. Oh, and Marc McClure-who was Jimmy Olsen in the Christopher Reeve Superman movies-has a cameo as a jail guard."

"nate-car","9","1","4","23 November 2017"," Finally... the Universe that DC has been working towards!
","After years for some, and decades for others, 5 Supermans, 7 Batmans, Green Lantern, Man of Steel, Wonder Woman, Batman VS. Superman and Suicide Squad the world finally got to see a DC movie with multiple characters and the wait was worth it Justice League delivers!<br/><br/>I was sceptical, and am a lifelong Marvel and X-Men fan, who never really cared for DC, and after seeing Thor 3 a few weeks ago (which was excellent) I expected this movie to fall flat. It didn't. It held my undivided attention from start to finish, you couldn't wipe the smile off my face, and every criticism that I had heard, and the TOO MANY ads and spoilers I had seen, did absolutely nothing to diminish how entertaining and satisfying this movie was.<br/><br/>The team worked well and were brought together organically. The cast was amazing, we (the World, Universe, People of Earth) obviously love Wonder Woman, and Gal Gadot is fantastic and grows stronger each appearance. Ben Affleck is the best Batman to date, bar none (and I am a huge Christian Bale fan)! He is the real deal, a big, tough, handsome, smart guy, with an obvious dark side, and absolutely owns the screen. Aquaman was very cool and likable, as were the intense Cyborg and youthful and inexperienced Flash who completely nailed it on their first outings and were not overshadowed at all by their much more famous counterparts.<br/><br/>Supermans return was AWESOME! I really enjoyed the way he was brought back gradually and finished off the film like the final piece to the puzzle. Henry Cavill and Amy Adams performances as Lois and Clark were really subtle, genuine, heartfelt and believable. This totally felt like the REAL Superman this time around, which is a tough call when it comes to playing such an iconic role.<br/><br/>The bad guy was BAD ASS! (and I was ready to hate the hell out of him!) He really could take down any of the team alone, and probably any three of them separately, so a tremendously big strong villain as the teams first threat worked well, in the end he was beaten mentally rather than physically which I quite liked. His minions were evil and quite tough, and much better than the completely forgettable (yet similar) cannon fodder ones from Avengers 1.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, from Commissioner Gordon, Alfred, Martha, Aqua Girl (Mera)... they all just meshed to make this a complete and complex universe that FINALLY seemed a worthy and legit place to showcase at very least four of the greatest characters ever created.<br/><br/>Over all, I was completely wrapped with this movie, and have thought about it TOO often since seeing it a couple of days ago, and consider it about the third best 3D movie I have ever seen after Avatar and Rogue One.<br/><br/>Honestly, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but in 'my own' humble opinion, anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie, is incapable of feeling joy or being entertained as it was an undeniable nonstop action roller-coaster and left me drooling for more like a little kid hopped up on superhero goofballs! (I may have to binge watch some DC TV shows just to cure this sickness!)<br/><br/>Where nothing previously stacked up to Dark Knight for DC, after JUSTICE LEAGUE, Avengers/Marvel finally has some REAL competition..."
"rt_b","10","1","4","22 November 2017"," Great movie.
","The movie was everything a DC comics fan wanted. The movie was easy to follow and had many laughs in it. The actors portrayed the characters faithfully to those of the comics. I really enjoyed the cgi and the special effects. The costumes and the background scenery was spot on. I give the movie 10 out of 10 it is a good fun action movie to enjoy."
"shurue","9","1","4","21 November 2017"," While I can nitpick it, I had such a fun time with it that I feel disingenuous doing so.
","While there are things I could nitpick in this movie, it's really hard to bring myself to do so. The whole movie was a really fun experience and one of my favourite s this year. The banter between the various JL members was much more comedic than you would expect. The amount of times you'll catch the actors just grinning from ear to ear as the movie plays out helps to lighten the tone of the overall piece, which is thematically appropriate when paired up with the precursor of Batman V Superman. However, while the movie was a fun ride, it also knew when to reign it in for more serious moments, and how to weave the two tones together into the same scene to deliver character exposition while still being entertaining. <br/><br/>DC seems to have found their footing with this one from a storytelling perspective, but one thing I never expected to improve genuinely surprised me – the music. While I've not hated the DC film universe's music, it's been far from a standout, which in comparison to other DC music outings, is a damn shame and something I'd pretty much given up on improving. However, the music composed by Danny Elfman blew me away. When it wasn't reminiscent of Batman TAS, it was pulling from Superman TAS, and, on very rare occasion, even the classic John Williams theme (which I would LOVE to see return). The music here is everything I could have hoped for in a DC movie with the one exception being that the Wonder Woman theme seemed to go unchanged. Which is fine really. It's barely in the movie. I just don't like it nearly as much as the other pieces of music in the film and don't think it fits in with the rest that well. <br/><br/>Since I mentioned the Wonder Woman music, I should probably go into the nitpicks that DID on occasion pull me out of the movie. Let's get the big one out of the way right off the bat - the CGI. There is just too much of it in the movie, and has a tendency to make certain shots that are supposed to look deadly serious instead appear comical. Usually this'll happen when Superman is fighting the big bad of the film, Steppenwolf, or in a scene where the aforementioned baddie enters into conflicts with large armies. The big battles here felt like they were trying to evoke something akin to Lord of the Rings, but since the armies in these scenes were filled with nothing but CGI, there was almost no tension there. However, every time the fighting got up close and you could tell it was real people fighting, the tension returned, so it wasn't too big an issue. If I'm sticking with my nitpicks, (and am willing to take the risk of sounding like a DC fan nutter) Flash's personality feels like a weird amalgamation of Barry Allen and Wally West, Aquaman acts more like an adrenaline junkie than Atlantean royalty, and Cyborg just doesn't fit in the Justice League roster when compared to the likes of Martian Manhunter or Green Lantern. It would have also been nice to see this lineup go to 7 rather than 6. However, as that could have bogged down the movie too much I would have been OK if a GL had been here in place of Cyborg and Martian Manhunter was established in his own movie later on. Basically I just don't like Cyborg being a Justice League member. It was a weird choice in the comics back in 2011 and it's weird here too. <br/><br/>Seeing as this is DC's first major team up movie, I feel like comparisons between this and the first Avengers movie are inevitable. To that end, imagine that 20 years from now, no one cares who ""got there first"". As both movies are a part of their respective cinematic universes, and are even both responsible for setting up the main villains of their whole series, it would make sense then, that both movies be compared based on which one managed the job better. To that end, I'd make the case that Justice League actually did a better job building up Darkseid than Avengers did Thanos. While it's true that JL has the assistance of BvS in this regard, even with this movie in a vacuum we get a sense of Apocalyptic technology, as well as a glimpse into that general world through the use of parademons and the like. The movie even had the sense to drop his name once, and only once, increasing the tension and buildup to his inevitable showing in a later movie, without jamming in our faces that he would be the big bad. By contrast in the first Avengers movie, while it is true that Thanos is technically the reason everything in that movie happened, we don't get any hints to this until that mid credits scene where he suddenly appears. It gets the job done, sure, but did we learn anything about him over the course of the film? Not really. We found out that he was connected to the Chitauri in some way. Those unfamiliar with the character have no reason to feel threatened or intimidated by him personally. I'm not trying to compare the two villains' portrayals as a whole. Rather, I'm just pointing out that DC's Justice League did a better job at setting up it's major villain than Marvel's Avengers did theirs, which is why I think that, down the line Justice League will age better than Avengers. One, while entertaining, leans heavily on nostalgia and memories of its initial release. The other is forced to stand apart from that emotional response, but manages to actually do more at the same time. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, I had a lot of fun with Justice League and am looking forward to adding it to my movie collection when it gets a blu-ray release."

"Aaron1375","9","1","4","21 November 2017"," Not sure why this film is being so criticized
","I went into this film with low expectations. Batman vs Superman was okay to me, but it did have a bunch of nonsensical stuff in it and did tend to drag setting up the main event. Then add to that, the fact this one is not exactly going over well with critics and other people and I was expecting a train wreck on the screen, but I still thought I would give it a shot as I have enjoyed Henry Cavill's Superman and I did want to see how he was brought back in. Suffice to say, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the film. I am also surprised by the negativity this film is getting as it seemed well done to me. It was not perfect, but I had a really good time watching it and I thought it was better than Wonder Woman, which I enjoyed as well, but did not get why it was so praised as it played out like your typical origin story. This one is being trashed when it was a fun super hero team film, so what, does DC and Warner Brothers just not have the money to bribe reviewers like Disney does? Does the general public do everything they are told or what? I will be the first to say that I am more of a Marvel hero fan all the way, as I did enjoy Thor: Ragnarok more than this one, but this one was not all that far behind. That is, not to me it was not and my parents both enjoyed it as well and neither were super fond of Batman vs Superman.<br/><br/>The story has Superman perished and the world kind of falling apart. Batman battles this strange creature that senses fear and he fears some sort of invasion is imminent due to material he has recovered from Lex Luther. He feels he must get a team together of super humans to try and defy the odds and beat back the threat which is a being known as Steppenwolf. This being strikes at the Amazons first and then the Atlanteans as he gathers these cubes together in an attempt to convert Earth into something else entirely. Soon the team of Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg battle the threat head on, but it seems readily apparent to Batman that more is needed and thus he begins to hatch a plan to revive the man of steel.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film, kind of wish I did not as I am sure I am going to take flack for it. The heroes were done really well as Ben Affleck's Batman was good as was Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. I enjoyed the Flash as he added some great humor to the flick and I liked how they did Cyborg as well. I was a bit skeptical of Jason Mamoa as Aquaman, but I thought he did a good job as well. The one that blew me away the most was Henry Cavill's Superman as he seemed the most like Superman in this one than in his other two appearances. He kicked some major butt in this film suffice to say! <br/><br/>So, I enjoyed the film. I was expecting it to be a complete mess, but I thought the story was pretty easy to follow. The film had more light moments than did Batman vs Superman and it had a lot more action too. It also accomplished both feats while being a shorter movie than Batman vs Superman. Once again though it was not perfect as I thought the film could have used more Superman; however, due to his limited use it does make the scenes he is in more awesome. Not sure they will create any more DC films due to the fact this one does not seem to be lighting the box office on fire, which seems a shame as to me they seem to be doing a good job with their films. I would love to see Darkseid in a Justice League film, but at least I finally got to see Superman really be Superman!"
"nire1982","10","1","4","21 November 2017"," Amazing from start to finish
","Screw the RT critics, screw the Marvel fanboys. This movie is amazing. Is it a perfect movie? Of course not, only idiots think that there is a perfect movie. Pacing had issues, sure, CGI on Supes was a little bit distracting but overall this is an enjoyable fun ride. IMO, this movie is a whole lot better than 70% of what Marvel has put out there. I'm sick of the comedy the other universe has been producing lately. If I want to watch a comedy show, I'd stick with stand-ups like JOKOY.<br/><br/>The Superman scenes were all amazing, now we get to experience the true Superman and what he is capable of. I'm a big fan of Jason Momoa now because of this and I cannot wait for his stand-alone Aquaman film showing next year. I have already watched this movie twice and am planning to watch it again a few more times. First viewing 8/10, second viewing 9/10."

","This was disappointing to say the least. I loved Man of Steel, I really enjoyed BVS even though I understood it had some pitfalls...But Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman were unforgivably awful to me.

I understand it was supposed to be important bc It was the first female superhero..We want it to win...As an African American...believe me I get it. And I was rooting for it...But it was horrible.<br/><br/>Justice League was just more Wonder Woman. It truly makes me sad. I was really behind Zak Snyder's vision.

When, instead of making things we're inspired to make...we make things we think people want to see.<br/><br/>Marvel has their cartoonish characters...And they do them well.

"brahmastyopuji","9","1","4","21 November 2017"," Fun, lot of action, dark but light!!
","This movie is great!<br/><br/>I will start from its flaw, and it is its very fast pace! you need to watch every moment of it if you don't want to skip and confuse in the end of the movie. But, they still give the audience a time to relax a little bit. This is understandable since they have to put so many stuff in the movie, from the characters introduction and its main story and even future easter eggs. For some people this might be very disturbing to have comic book movie with very fast pace and lot of action to follow, but trust me, the actual story is quite simple and its villain motivation is simple as well. It is easier to understand its motivation than, for example, batman v superman, or even the avengers 2: age of ultron, which i believe as the worst villain motivation in comic book movies.<br/><br/>Now after i talk about it flaw, lets talk about what make it great! First of all, ""The Characters"". Every superhero characters in this movie plays important role, even for a Cyborg where most people think that he will play in a shorter time! No it doesn't! He plays very important part. The only superheroes character who play less than the other is Aquaman, but it's not because he has less screening time, it is just because his story is not fully revealed, and i believe it is because he will have his own movie next year. But still, during the final act he still have very important role. The chemistry between all superheroes are also awesome, we can feel how Diana feels about Bruce, how Flash with his awkwardness but feels really happy to be on the team and how every superheroes connected to each other. It is great and fun!<br/><br/>Second but not least is how DC really lighten their tone without changing their dark scheme color. It is totally fun to see some jokes, but their jokes seems really on its place, you will not see any jokes during the final act, unlike other superheroes movie who always try to put any jokes even when their facing their main villain. As I mention before, DC does not change their color scheme, it is dark? Yes, with a lot of contrast color. Just like other DC superhero movie, most of their scene are still during the evening and i think it is better that way, but this time, their superheroes are no longer have ""bad mood face"". In the end of this movie, I can feel the hope rises, and smile are fulfilling this movie's atmosphere.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the next DC's movie next year."

","Justice League was a pretty good movie. I loved the movie and how all the costumes looked on the actors and makes me wish I had costumes like the flashes, batman's and cyborg. I loved the acting in the movie by all character's that were in the movie. When Superman came back to life and fought Cyborg, Wonder woman, and Batman all at once while simultaneously being able to see the Flash running at him. And seeing the Flash's reaction was so hilarious. I thought it was also, pretty cool with seeing Batman get his butt kicked by Superman. But I did not like how when Batman asked Alfred for help, it literally takes him 10 seconds to pop out of nowhere with Louis Lane to bring superman back to normal. I thought it was fun to see the Justice League work as a team and mostly seeing Superman beat all the enemies up on his own like we would expect, because he is a god. Finally, I love how at the end of the credits we get to see Lex Luther and Slade aka Deathstroke become a team."

","As a non comic book fan, I went into this movie expecting it to be a disaster of a movie based on the development issues with two directors, multiple rewrites and re-shoots. The critics on rotten tomatoes and metascore don't give this movie a chance to be the big blockbuster it could be.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some issues with pace. We don't really get to know the new characters before the action starts. We need time to get emotional attach to these characters and get behind them as they try to save the world. The same thing goes for the villain, he does not seem like the destroyer of worlds, we don't have time to really fear him or his army. I believe this flaw is due to having to many hands in the cookie jar, too many different thoughts about what this movie should be.<br/><br/>But nevertheless, the chemistry between the characters are great. Wonder Women and Batman step into their veteran roles and guild the newbies into what being a hero really is. Each character has a personality that works well for the team. I really liked all the characters except Ezra Millers, the Flash. Too many times he was the comic relief and pulls The viewer out of the scene.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were entertaining, a real superhero show down with each character showing their skills set and personality. The special effects were on par with other super hero movies of this era.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this movie for what it is, a fun entertaining super hero movie for everyone."
"pruhe","8","1","4","20 November 2017"," Don't listen to critics it's a fun film and definitely worth wasting your money on!
","I'm going to start of by saying this is a good film but has its downfalls just like any films but WB haven't lived up to the hype! The downfall of this film is the story line is bit simple and the CGI in all fairness is weak but Ben affleck as batman was a lot better I actually enjoyed Ben affleck in this film and wonder women was faultless yet again and it was nice to have bit of humour in this from mainly the flash and aquerman who were cast on point. People SHOULD not be put of because of critic reviews let's be honest they will give a 10/10 to a film no one has heard off! The film Is a lot of fun I think the portrayal of batman is a lot better now! I do believe that DC should of started by making each individual characters solo movie first but I enjoyed the movie so I can't complain to much. I'm a massive fan or marvel but I love the DC just as much now I see the bigger picture they are creating! Maybe a change in director may give it that extra boost I don't know. But non the less Zack Snyder and Josh whedon did a good job of justice league! I can see the DC having some dark times with critics but they should stick out what they are building with these character and more to come and I truly believe it can pull off! So don't mess around go watch this movie!"
"DarkVulcan29","9","1","4","20 November 2017"," The League has arrived
","After Marvels The Avengers(2012), I'm sure comic book fans where wondering when there will be a live action version of DCs Justice League, It has been in animated, now it's finally here. But unlike The Avengers this film feels more rushed and quickly put together. But it was still enjoyable.<br/><br/>Batman(Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman(Gal Gadot), AquaMan(Jason Momoa), Cyborg(Ray Fisher), and The Flash(Ezra Miller) discover that a big threat is coming, and must team up to stop it.<br/><br/>Not quite has epic has The Avengers, but still an entertaining film, a little bit over the top with CGI. The actors has the iconic characters really do well, all have a great chemistry. Although I felt that Ezra Miller was overdoing the nerd bit with his character. This has been getting mixed reviews by critics, pretty much all DCU films have been getting, except for Wonder Woman. I hope to see more Justice League films in the future."
"eriksgrafs","5","1","4","20 November 2017"," Good movie that leaves much to be desired and improved unfortunately.
","Here is the problem and what I would have done as an example: Justice League is rushed, no emotional themes are explored, there is no emotional depth, except for Flash's story, which is also rushed. The movie's villain is sh*t, he starts off well enough, but actually is very one dimensional and weak. When Superman is resurrected and beats everyone easily, its plain to see the villain is not going to be a match for Superman, so the movie might as well end there. What I would have liked to see: Superman refused to fight for several reasons, because he needed time to come in grips with his death and rethink things, maybe he doesn't want to fight anymore at all, feels like he died for nothing and wants nothing to do with Batman and saving humanity,he is disappointed with humanity. he just wants a quite life in the countryside with Louise, which is the only thing he cares about. Maybe his abilities aren't so good anymore, he has problems similar to what he had in his childhood - hearing too much, seeing too much hate, which reminds him of his dead stepfather and destroyed planet. So while Superman deals with his PTSD, stress, and identity crisis, (HE WAS DEAD FOR Christ SAKE, but we didn't see any effect on him) Justice League has a hard fight ahead of them, so Batman comes up with a genius plan that needs teamwork, so we see them bonding as a group while training. When it comes to the actual fight, Steppenwolf isn't a pussy like what we saw, instead he is actually intelligent and a hard opponent to beat. Batmans plan doesn't work the first time, so they fall back and need to innovate. Batman tries to come up with a new plan, the strategist that he is, but Wonder Woman takes the lead and comes up with a new plan, which is something innovative, and preferably involves absolute best from each member of the League (so basically Aquaman actually does something, not just look good without his shirt on, and he can be helpful). When the fight is done, they are surprised by Superman, that apologizes for not helping them, explains the situation, that he needs time, but that ultimately, when he is ready, he will be a part of the Justice League. He forgives Batman, maybe asks for forgiveness for beating his ass earlier when resurrected, and they have a bonding moment with a manly handshake. Flash says: finally he will have friends, Wonder Woman says: no, we wont be friends. We will be family. And the movie cuts to black. Now THAT would have been interesting, THAT would have had emotional depth, that would have been innovative to some degree. We saw nothing new or interesting, less innovation than inventing a bicycle in the 21st century. When the movie was done I was left with a hole in my heart, because the movie just didn't do enough, didn't explore their characters emotions and problems, and I knew it could have been done much better, especially if there were previous movies with Flash, Cyborg and Aqua man. It was just lets go kick this bad guys ass, queue action sequence, Superman comes in beats everyone obviously, queue credits. At the end of the day of course its all subjective opinions. But let me just say: I love DC to the Moon and back, Batman is my favorite superhero of all time, and precisely that is the reason why its so sad seeing DC fumble with their movie universe, its just sad really. I know they try, and I can see the effort in every movie, but it just falls short for me, because Marvel does it all so much better. For years and years Marvel have been building up Avengers, while DC rushed it in 1 movie. Its not good enough, the standards are high, I understand that, but that's no excuse."
"Yendd","4","1","4","20 November 2017"," Justice League: Right Back At It Again
","Justice League. Not DC's Avengers, THE Justice League. The unification of Detective Comics most powerful heroes into one entity to protect planet Earth from threats within and without. The force that many wanted to be a part of growing up, that hit children's TV shows have been made of and that comics have been running for years with iconic and best selling story lines. Like Batman V Superman, this should be one of the biggest films of the year. It should easily blow out the competition in the Comic Book Film market and should be going for the Number 2 spot in the Highest Grossing 2017 movie list.<br/><br/>But like Batman V Superman, it's going to be a rough time.<br/><br/>Critically ""eh""'d at by both fans and naysayers with many giving it a ""Not as bad as Batman V Superman"", they've really set the bar low on how good their films can be. And after having watched the film about 2 days ago, upon writing, I can say that those that have gone ""eh"" are right.<br/><br/>This film is not a masterpiece. It is not the film that echoes the Justice League Unlimited of the past and it is not the film that even comes close to Wonder Woman. This film is boring, badly paced with bad jokes with badly performed punchlines. It's a visual sensation, but that was never a problem, the problem was the sheer amount of visuals to wrap your head around. It has the depth of a paddling pool and if you think about it for too long you might get a headache because this once again does not make sense.<br/><br/>The story is a copy and paste from The Avengers, which got boring with Age of Ultron, Suicide Squad and other various Superhero films that all end in the team having a big CGI fight with the villain where they have to stop them from destroying the entire world so they, or someone they work for, can rule it for all of eternity. Collect X item at Y location for Z outcome before A Team come and stop B Villain.<br/><br/>DC has just a wide range of villains that it can pick from, why they went for someone as obscure and underdeveloped as Steppenwolf astounds me. Take away the fact that he does nothing in the entire movie, I hadn't even heard of him in the comics before and even though I haven't read Issue #6 of Detective Comics, I know enough about the characters and their respective villains to know EGGHEAD. But add in the movie spice that takes a layer away, and you're left with Malekth but with even less substance, because at least Maleketh was actually doing everything because Asgard killed his ENTIRE RACE. Steppenwolf is doing it ""For The Unity"" and ""For Darkseid"".<br/><br/>So the plot and the villain are terrible and the writing with jokes is on and off with most of them not landing and only some situations where they attempt to make jokes actually working. What are we left with? Character interaction!<br/><br/>Batman - The complete opposite to BvS because people hated it and they didn't have the guts to show him actually change from wanting to end crime through the permanent means of death to going through the system and trusting that one day humanity will actually sort itself out.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman - See Wonder Woman the movie now out on Blu-Ray, it's pretty good and people thought that so go see it before seeing this mess.<br/><br/>The Flash - Watch the TV Show for the actual Barry Allen and pretend this is Wally West instead.<br/><br/>Aquaman - See Aquaman 2018, sorry we didn't get the film out in time but it'll be good we promise.<br/><br/>Cyborg - He's here too!<br/><br/>Superman - Sorry we killed him in the previous film in the most disrespectful way we possibly could, here, we'll get him to almost kill the entire Justice League and make you think that we'll go down a route that makes this entire universe the universe that it seems like it is but then pull one over and have him be a Superman you can actually like without us having to make an entire movie to build him back up and make him like an actual character or give him any characteristics from the comics and have him smile more YAY WE DID IT!<br/><br/>There are some good things to the film though. The Superman fight, while boring, did have the shining moment of Superman's speed compared to the Flash which made me laugh and the use of Superman's Frost Breath actually gave me an erection because HIS FROST BREATH IS NOT USED ENOUGH GOD DAMN.<br/><br/>Apart from all of the things that I just said and the ones I've left unspoken, including the way they handle Superman's resurrection and how it's the literal worst way they could've done it, this film doesn't leave you with a bad taste in your mouth from the amount of excrement you just ate while watching it.<br/><br/>It ends on the note of, we're trying guys, we just don't want to copy Marvel too much and have these films be their own thing away from the corporate machine, before giving up two post credits scenes that make you realise that they're lying and that once Flashpoint happens we are getting a full Marvel DC film.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, once you've seen the film and you're walking out the cinema trying to wonder what is going on with Deathstroke's beard and why Arrow has a better Deathstroke and how that is even possible.<br/><br/>Justice League isn't as bad as Batman V Superman.<br/><br/>And that's all we can hope for in this Age of Heroes."

The story was to narrow and you know what was going to happen at all time. the bad guy was boring, but in his defense i do also find him boring in the comicbooks and the CGI was awful at times. The ting that annoyed me the most was the tone they gave Batman, i found Batman to be more like Tony Stark at times in this move and he was noting like how Batman is supposed to be. Don't take me wrong, Ben Affleck was great as batman, but the tone the film-creator's gave him in this movie was not right. i liked more the version and tone from Batman from BvS.<br/><br/>since I am a big Batman fan this kinda ruin the movie a little bit. but overall i did enjoy the movie and are hyped for what to come this way i give it 5/10 stars."

","I am one of the few people who actually liked 'Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice' even though it was a mess, so I was really looking forward to the Justice League movie to see how it redeems the dc movie- verse.I was pleasantly surprised to see the movie exceeded my expectations.<br/><br/>Batman and Wonder Woman are in fantastic form as always. Aquaman is hilariously refreshing. Cyborg (ironically) brings humanity and depth to the group. Even Superman (oops Spoiler) is having such fun, smiling and cracking jokes. The best of the lot is definitely The Flash. Ezra Miller as Barry Allen steals every scene he is in. Barry is so innocent and vulnerable and apprehensive, yet at the same time tries to be brave that he is the most relatable among the lot.<br/><br/>There is not much to say about the plot. It is really predictable. The antagonist 'Steppenwolf' is plain ridiculous, but who cares about him when we have such wonderful characters to root for. The entire cast is so likable, and the camaraderie between them is electric and refreshing.They make the movie fun to watch. The JL members are so perfectly cast that I definitely want to see more of them and this movie was the perfect launch-pad. So watch the movie for them. I have much hope for the future movies and am eagerly awaiting them."

"Ingrouille181","6","1","4","19 November 2017"," Let it end with this one
","I don't despise or hate the DCEU, but by this point, it'd be good if WB let it die here and now. Man of Steel is passable, Batman v Superman is a muddled mess, Suicide Squad was a complete mess, Wonder Woman is good and Justice League is just good. Has world building, no duh, but with 3 out of 5 of the movies so far being less than ideal or just plain terrible, it'd be nice to start fresh with a DC Cinematic Universe<br/><br/>Story. Batman and Wonder Woman seek out to recruit Barry Allen; Flash, Arthur Curry: Aquaman and Victor Stone; Cyborg to their cause in order to stop the villainous Steppenwolf, before he uses three cubes to what else, take over the world. And that's it in a nut shell. Looking back on it, there's nothing else to it. Halfway through, our heroes unite, plan, talk, plan, go to some Eastern European town and save the world, defeating the villain and going their separate ways until the next installment. Did I mention that Joss Whedon re-shot about 30-40% of this film after Snyder left, cause this feels very Age of Ultron esque. I admire that he put some humour into a Justice League film, but that only makes it tonally inconsistent to the Zach Snyder DC movies so far.<br/><br/>It has a simple story, some good pacing admittedly, likable characters, predictable dialogue and jokes, and a really cheap ending. It really made me wonder what ending Snyder would have given it had he remained. I could tell which scenes and dialogue was included by Whedon instantly. The villain is one note and cliché, just like Ultron or that Dark Elf guy turned out to be in the MCU.<br/><br/>Affleck and Gadot are fine in their roles. I really like Jason Mamoa as Aquaman, and even though I'm done with the DCEU by this point, I'll go see Aquaman just for him when it comes out. Ezra Miller was fine as the flash, and that's all, fine. Not my first choice. He's too goofy; in my mind the flash is meant to be a hardened and mature, yet whimsical character, not just down right goofy, and no, the touching scenes he has with his dad didn't sell. Ray Fisher I liked as Cyborg; I wanna see what he does in a standalone Cyborg film. Even though it stuns me today that Snyder chose Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, this was a good choice, he's half and half when it comes to casting, I will say.<br/><br/>And now, a SPOILER Superman comes back to life halfway through, and it's both contrived, and a waste of time from the last movie. They do nothing interesting with him being back, and what they do is over in a 'flash'; the league needs Superman so the script makes it so. And again, the tonal shift Whedon makes just makes this superman comes off like a different person, which looking back on the previous films, I actually admire that; he's not a brooding a'hole this time around. And I won't lie, it cheapens the forming of the justice league in a sense, but I feel like either way the league would have been formed; they still have Steppenwolf to fight, I didn't feel like Superman's ""inspiration"" to Batman meant anything really. Not to mention, depending on Superman to win the day really cheapens the other characters and their abilities.<br/><br/>On one nitpick, I really wanted Batman's skills and weaponry to pay off more. I wanted to see that metal suit from BvS, or something like the Hellbat Armour from the comics show up; he just fights in his batman suit, no guns, just good old martial arts and small gadgets against an invincible god and an army of monsters twice his strength.<br/><br/>The ending ends on a promising note, but that being said the DCEU, if it continues past this point, still had a rough and disappointing start, and it's gonna be distracting going forward. I just want it to end so we can start fresh; yes it will be a pain in the neck for WB, but that's what you get for shoving all your mandated nonsense on the directors and the script. Stop trying to be Marvel, stop trying to play catch up with Marvel. Take time to develop your stories. Let creative directors do what they want with the characters and you'll get somewhere."
"JasonR77","8","1","4","19 November 2017"," Comes Together Nicely
","I don't see what the problem is.<br/><br/>While this movie would have benefited from more buildup, maybe a solo Flash, Cyborg, and/or Aquaman movie, when taken for what it is, it's a solid success. It's a team build on the same scale as the Avengers, just without the added benefit of backstory.<br/><br/>Going in, my thought was that Aquaman was going to steal the show, but that honor goes to the Flash. Ezra Miller offers a different take on Barry Allen from the Grant Gustin version, and it works well within the team's dynamic. Every scene he is in is better for him being there, and his wide-eyed viewing of many of the events he is privy to adds a comedic element that could have easily been overlooked.<br/><br/>And once again, Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is the star of the show. She holds the entire movie together on her own, and while Batman is the one whose brainchild the team is, she is truly the driving force, and the character with the most happening as the film develops. Gadot came right out of the solo movie and into this one without missing a beat, and that makes it all the better.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon's hands are all over this thing. Fans of his work will notice his style, particularly the snappy and funny dialogue, and he does a lot to overshadow Snyder, and pull the movie away from his clutch into something that is more enjoyable and lighter than Batman v. Superman, even though the stakes are infinitely higher.<br/><br/>Steppenwolf is well realized, though perhaps not the ideal villain for this scenario. He is clearly a precursor to the inevitable arrival of Darkseid, a stronger, more complex character that is also pure evil. The film gets a bit bogged down in the Mother Box piece, and they almost feel like a MacGuffin of the highest order, but their utilization toes that line, rather than outright jumping over it.<br/><br/>The film is a great deal of fun. After two of the previous installments in the DCEU were more or less duds with minimal humor, and a rush job to get this universe established, the League finally arrives together on screen with aplomb, and in far more entertaining fashion than it would have if DC hadn't pivoted and allowed humor to be a part of it. Though I will say that Batman making even one joke is a little odd.<br/><br/>9/10. Don't listen to the critics on this one."
"thesar-2","4","1","4","19 November 2017"," Justice Another Nail
","So, this was directed by two people. Two completely separate visions. And it shows.<br/><br/>There are moments in Justice League that are good, really good, even, but you're going to have to wait until about half the movie's over before they kick in. Yeah, it takes a tremendous amount of time to get to the goods and Superman, of course.<br/><br/>I don't care that the trailers, posters, advertising, etc, left out Kal-El – it was painfully obvious he was coming back. I had just prayed they wouldn't wait until the last 5 minutes to reveal his return.<br/><br/>Mercifully, I was wrong, but not too far off. He's definitely not the spotlight here. That's reserved for more, well, amateur superheroes. <br/><br/>I guess they're going for the They're All New To This Job, like how the president's moronic moments are being justified. Take Batman. Leave him on his own and he's badass and the smartest person in the room. You give him partners and you have: Batman & Robin and now, Justice League.<br/><br/>Basically, Bruce knows something bad is coming and he attempts to gather up the other ""special"" beings to stop a watered down villain and motives. Once everyone's gathered, well, most everyone, they pull a Danny Ocean: ""You think we need one more?...You think we need one more...All right, we'll get one more."" (Or, just an excuse to get Superman back in the League he's always all-but led.) <br/><br/>Now, while it's shoddily written and easy enough for kids to follow and yet too adult for them to see, it does have some fantastic new characters I wouldn't mind seeing more of: The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman. Wonder Woman was a badass fighter and brought a lot of humor to the movie. Batman was just okay. And Superman was a 180 from his previous two outings from Henry Cavill and a whole lot fun to watch the few times he was on screen.<br/><br/>I remember this was SUPPOSED to be part one of two, or one larger movie split into two, but since that wore down the audiences with increasingly failed attempts, it was scrapped. Not to mention, the DCU isn't (mostly) well received. This movie truly felt like two movies crammed into one and with too many ""Oh! There's that character!"" and ""Oh! There's that comic book subplot!"" Honestly, they should've gone the Marvel route and had everyone had their own origin movies and then get them all together, slowly but surely.<br/><br/>Eh, it's not necessarily a terrible movie, but not one I want to rush to see again. I will say it was nice that Danny Elfman was composing and brought back some nostalgia from past movie series. <br/><br/>I just think the cast and crew were just as confused at what was going on as were our superheroes who were trying to save the world. DCU: Just stop. Wait a few years, woo writers from Disney and start over again. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Not many DCU movies out there, so here's my Top Five Faves!<br/><br/>1. Man of Steel (★★★★★/5 Stars.)<br/><br/>2. Batman v Superman: Ultimate Edition (★★★★★/5 Stars.)<br/><br/>3. Wonder Woman (★★★★/5 Stars.)<br/><br/>4. Suicide Squad: Extended Cut (★★★/5 Stars.)<br/><br/>5. Justice League (★★½/5 Stars.)"

","DC films version of AVENGERS ASSEMBLE. Two hours of non stop action and absolutely no messing around with Character introductions - in fact very little connections to other movies - but straight to the point. <br/><br/>Some of the heroes/Villains have been seen before, DC currently have several successful TV ventures, but this film really raises the bar on the whole Super - hero franchise as far as action and FX go, and it deserves to be a smash hit, albeit the film could have been a bit more tense at time - although it works as a movie for all ages.<br/><br/>Without Henry Cavill's superb performance - I would have rated this 2 stars less but he really did make this from a good film to a great one. This is the best Superman has been portrayed on screen. All round good performances with the best of the rest - Jason Momoa was also outstanding as Arthur Curry/Aquaman. Ben Affleck was OK but was much better in BATMAN VS SUPERMAN. <br/><br/>The plot is wafer thin and simple - a threat to the world, Stepenwolf, seeks to obtain 3 boxes to gain maximum power to take over the world and the heroes of Batman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman have to reluctantly unite to stop him. But they just ain't quite a match with this combination alone, and the late Man of Steel is may be the only chance they have !! <br/><br/>Despite the flaws, this is still a very enjoyable film, so go and enjoy this movie for what it is - a no - nonsense action superhero team up movie, and 2 hours that any DC comic book fan will love. The scenes with Superman alone should be witnessed on the big screen. I look forward to potentially better DC movies.<br/><br/>Watch the movie till after the credits."

","Well to start off the movie is good and fun.Its not as bad as the reviews its getting. Its way better than the blunder BVS was for sure.<br/><br/>Due to the WB's decision to cut the movie time from 2h 50m(iirc) to 1h 50m the movie lacks certain connecting scenes. Sometimes it feels like you are jumping from one movie scene to another. Despite that the movie doesn't feel disconnected. The villain is forgettable(which villain isn't , each superhero movie so far has one) and doesn't have screen presence might be due the edited scenes. Action scenes could have been better.<br/><br/>Final thoughts - movie is worth watching. I would love to watch the ultimate cut or director's cut of the movie."
"ivanbakallov","4","1","4","19 November 2017"," Some words on the movie
","Well its better than Batman vs Superman but again the characters are underdeveloped. For example we have for The Flash exactly few words of his origin. He is presented like somebody not so clever and maybe he is something like computer geek ( its not clear, we only saw room full of computers). Well The Flash in the series is way better and Grand Gustin is light years away from the performance of Ezra Miller. Aquamen, well he is Jason Momoa and Jason is the same dude in SGA, Game of Thrones and now here. Hanry Cavil is OK but OMG the SGA mustache removal is not so well. The good things are Batman, Wonder Woman and Alfred. But their potential is not used well. They can do much, much better if they have the chance. And finally Cyborg, new infamous actor, again poor introduction, very little background and that's it. In conclusion i must say the main problem is the too early forced combine heroes movies without the origin stories and adequately developed characters. Marvel movies for now are almost perfect. The new Thor was brilliant. If DC wants to put humor in it they must take notes when they watch Thor."

But what I think is the worst is the fact that Warner brothers wanted to make the heroes union really fast, and that's where it failed a bit. I think that they choped out a great portion of the film, (in my opinion the Steppenwolf introduciton really failed to my thoughts, too fast) they should have not put so much out, or at least not as much."

First off they introduce Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman with out their own stand alone movies so in JL it was like.... here is 5 mins of backstory to introduce each character... here you go and action! Secondly there is no difference (except less quality) that separates this from the Marvel equivalent. They need to take their time and not rush these films just to compete with Marvel. This movie felt very rushed. Marvel/Disney has been setting this thing up for 10+ years...."
"Troy_Campbell","6","1","4","18 November 2017"," Decent superhero romp... DC has learnt some lessons.
","Playing catch-up in the comic-book cinematic universe race (Disney's Avengers and 20th Century Fox's X-Men franchises still way ahead), Warner Brothers' assembly of their most prized DC characters has had an arduous road to release. Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad were critical disasters, Ben Affleck has quickly reneged on his long-term involvement as this universe's Batman, and director Zack Snyder departed before principal production finished due to unfortunate personal circumstances. All that aside, Snyder—with the help of Joss Whedon who was brought in to complete production—has carved out a blockbuster that has seemingly learnt from some of the mistakes that bogged down BvS. First, the tone has been lightened, most directly through the introduction of quip-happy team members Flash (Ezra Miller) and Aquaman (Jason Mamoa); the former's social awkwardness and the latter's carefree swagger adding a nice counterbalance to the core trio's sincerity. With his super-speed depicted on screen via awesome slow-mo, Flash is also gifted the best action sequences. The standout set piece, a Superman-Flash confrontation, is an exhilarating skirmish that ranks among the best of the year. Unfortunately, the Chernobyl-set climax is the epitome of what plagues these DC movies: overwrought green-screen battles that are messily edited, sloppily shot and virtually indecipherable from a visual standpoint. Why they keep persisting with such a gloomy aesthetic and murkily choreographed action is anyone's guess. The villain is a tad bland too, the end-of-world obsessed Steppenwolf (played in motion capture by Ciarin Hinds) offering very little outside of the usual bad guy tropes. On the flip side, Henry Cavill's Superman is the coolest he's ever been, Gal Gadot is still charmingly kick-ass as Wonder Woman and Ben Affleck broods the hell out of his aging, grizzled Batman. More time and effort has clearly been put into crafting a more cohesive, interesting story too; the surprisingly short runtime (enforced by Warner Brothers) driving the creative team to strip back superfluous narrative elements and focus on the character relationships that propel the main plot along. Somehow, despite the odds stacking up against it and its many flaws, Justice League delivers a decent superhero romp. There's just enough humour and charisma to give the longevity of the DC cinematic universe a glimmer of hope."
"Alsoklms","5","1","4","18 November 2017"," Good if you need to make some time
","I was in town and I needed to wait almost 5 hours, the cinema was nearby so I decide to go and watch any movie. Justice League was among the first on list, (yeah, I was so early there that I was waiting even before they opened the cinema) so I decided to watch it because all I wanted was to kill a lot of time. <br/><br/>First: the jokes. They were so boring and forced that I almost ended feeling uncomfortable. Second: the plot. I don't know if it could have been better, but it was way too simple. Third and last: the villain. COME ON DC YOU CAN DO BETTER. <br/><br/>So by half of the movie I was yawning and thinking on anything else, but neither of those things were about the movie. I didn't like the movie at all, even when for my was a movie to make some time. I imagine how disappointed I would had feel if I where planed go to the cinema."
"Zephrey","6","1","4","18 November 2017"," 300 million budget??? Disappointing. Nothing Unique at all.
","Where to begin. Honestly the plot is terrible, we've seen this story line to many times. I feel like nowadays all superhero movies have to be about saving the earth. The plot was very simple, there was noting special about it, it doesn't stand out at all.<br/><br/>The villain was also a big letdown, there absolutely nothing unique about Steppenwolf, I mean he could've been amazing, but he was just boring, his motif was the same as any over powered villain, he just doesn't bring out anything scary or amazing, he's just boring.<br/><br/>The one thing I did like where the references and the easter egg's, it gave me a little excitement that DC will have a brighter future for there next films. Being a fan of the comics I was really hoping that they would follow the Injustice story line, I mean that is one of the greatest story line's ever released and since they have all the rights to their characters it could be possible.<br/><br/>That's another thing. I feel like the character's were to rushed, there was no feeling, in the short time Justice Leagues was able to make impact for the characters backstories, but it just wasn't the same as Wonder Woman. I really felt like they should've released the solo films first. Because The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg just didn't really have any feelings for them. Justice League felt like a really rushed film only focusing on my making money. With a 300 million budget they definitely should've been capable of more.<br/><br/>It also just feels like a mirror of Marvel. DC fanboys always talk about how their universe is so much darker, but put it next to any Marvel movie and it will seem exactly the same. Some of the jokes seemed forced, never thought Zack was they type of guy into comedy, but speaking of Zack, it really didn't seem like his type of film. Apparently there was 5 hours of footage, but it most of it got cut. Of course to make it a film. You can see that from the trailer, there was a lot of scenes that weren't in there at all. WB really just needs the director to let his vision flow.<br/><br/>Overall the film can be enjoyable while watching, but after it's done and you've collected your thoughts you'll just think of it as a déja vu. It was pretty disappointing for me, because the film had potential. I know there's a lot of positive reviews, but if your going into the theater expecting another BvS or SS then you'll think the movie was amazing. Honestly all the 9-10 stars or 1-4 stars are a lie, its not complete trash, but it fails to deliver something to the fans and the wider audience, with that being said I feel like critics are a little harsh on DC."

","WB listened to the complaints for MoS, BvS, SS, and gave the moviegoers JL right 1hour 50+ mins JL the cuttings on the floor is what moviegoers asked for Real dark and gritty Zack Synder scenario is no different than The Blue Period of Picasso Besides Zack has repeatedly said JL would be lighter the moviegoers maintained their stances fun and brighter Joss Whedon brought his denied WW script, his sour AoU and Batgirl/Bat Buffy attitude and ruined the mood Regardless the trailers are groovy, JL is still a good view-able movie Let this be a lesson learned to allow the director's vision to be told And stop rebooting Batman and Superman there are other superheroes in the DCEU You don't see IM,Thor, CA, GotG, being rebooted after a origin instead you get team ups WB/DCEU stand your ground for not copy of another studios formula/the true DC fans are your fans stop getting greedy to bring Marvel fans to your movies Wonder Woman did well not because of feminism it's because you introduced the last member of the Trinity after 75+ years WW made it to the big screen Hint, let Geoff Johns and Patty Jenkins direct origins/sequels, and new directors their team ups"
"Eshan_2110","7","1","4","18 November 2017"," Fun but it should have been the biggest film of 2017
","I've been waiting patiently for this film now as I'm sure many of you have, and whilst I can say it's fun and enjoyable, something seems missing. It's not quite ""epic"" as you'd want a film about the Justice League to be. It should on paper be, the biggest film of 2017-because that's how popular these characters are. But it's not, as much as it pains me to say it.<br/><br/>I'll cut straight to the chase, the character dynamics are fantastic and that is simply the best part of the film. I feel they have done justice (pun not indented) in portraying the characters faithfully, albeit with very little development-but that was expected with the films two hour run time (something I will come back to later). However, my main problem with the film was the soundtrack. Some may question this, but the soundtrack really does make a difference in making a film memorable. BvS for all its flaws had a fantastic soundtrack from Hanz Zimmer and Junkie XL. I'm truly disappointed to have to say that Danny Elfman does not deliver in creating a single piece of memorable music for this film. His use of previous soundtracks of the characters doesn't even work for me. Part of the problem of having a weak score, is that it inherently makes everything less memorable, with some of the films biggest moments becoming less impactful. <br/><br/>The narrative is simple, Steppenwolf and his parademons have come to collect all three of the mother boxes as part of his quest for power. After the death of Superman,crime is on the rise and fear is a prevalent theme. Bruce Wayne therefore, decides to create a team of superhero's who can battle this antagonist and that's where the other heroes come into play. I didn't have any problems with the narrative, but rather with the editing. This criticism derives from its two-hour runtime, a mandate set by Warner Bros. This meant a lot of footage was most likely cut and as such the pacing of the film is quite rushed unfortunately. Another problem I had was the CGI and more the fact that it was up there with Suicide Squad for having the weakest CGI in the DCEU. The film didn't stand out visually nor have a sequence that looked as good as the opening of BvS. I think the loss of cinematographer, Larry Fong, is most definitely felt in the film.<br/><br/>The cast are fantastic and the chemistry between one and other made for a really enjoyable viewing. It was also the first time I felt jokes actually hit the right notes in a DC film. There are some really great lines, especially from the Flash. Steppenwolf is initially interesting, but his motives are not the most exciting. He is more filler for the actual focus of the film-the six members of the Justice League.<br/><br/>A lot of the best moments of this film come from when the team are together. I think a lot of the criticisms of the films from critics should be placed on Warner Bros. I do think they are part of the problem here, and they really need to let DC sort out their vision for this universe, because at this point their schedule is a convoluted mess. With that said, there is hope indeed for the DCEU. With great characters, I see so many places the DCEU can go. They just need to make their films as character driven and unique as possible. Oh, and they need to make sure their scores aren't as bland as Justice League's."

"spideybnh","8","1","4","18 November 2017"," A surprising,fun, and lighthearted adventure!
","Justice League, one of the most hyped movies of the year. I was definitely reluctant to see this as a result of the bad taste that BVS left in my mouth. The plot... was extremely simple. Steppenwolf gets the mother boxes and so the league revives superman to defeat him. The real meat of this movie was the characters. The League itself. Let's look at them.<br/><br/>The League Itself: The league was great. All of the characters seemed like they would actually hate each other. (other than Flash of course) Most of them are what you would expect. Wonder Woman is the leader. Cyborg is the emotional baggage. Aquaman is the jerk. Superman is Mr.Perfect... yes Superman is back. Batman is... kind of irrelevant. Sure he assembles the team but he isn't even the leader. He has trouble beating up a single para demon while everyone is destroying them, and doesn't even do all of the science stuff that Batman is known for. <br/><br/>Steppenwolf: Simply he is basic. He is the villain to be a villain. He doesn't have any emotional baggage, and certainly isn't likable. He is just a bad character.<br/><br/>The Post-Credit scene: It is amazing! Lex Luthor breaks out of prison and meets Deathstroke on a Yacht. Lex says that they need to make a Leigon of their own... LEIGON OF DOOM!<br/><br/>Justice League is just a good time! I recommend it to anyone who likes any of these characters. It is very different than any of the other DCEU movies! I recommend it to anyone who enjoys good movies!"

"sudeerasj","4","1","4","18 November 2017"," You know there's something wrong when the best part about the movie is the post-credit scene.
","I watched JL and I managed to enjoy it even though it failed to live up to my expectations. Sure, it's not the best comic-book movie ever. Sure, it has its own set of flaws most of which affects to the viewers who aren't familiar with the comics. Sure, the re-writes, the last minute edits and the re-shoots has obviously ruined what seems like it could have been a great movie. But still I think it is a good(just good) movie and worth checking out despite all of that. Perhaps even more than once if you're a fan of these characters.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a Solid 7 out of 10 :<br/><br/>++ The opening sequence. ++ True to the source portrayals of the beloved DC characters for the most part. ++ The chemistry between the JL members. ++ The cast and their performances. ++ Great action scenes and set-pieces. ++ Likable, inspiring heroes worth caring for. Especially the Flash and Wonder Woman. ++ That killer post-credits scene.<br/><br/>What I didn't like :<br/><br/><ul><li>Steppenwolf AKA the latest entry in the long list of ""Bad-ass looking CGI punching bags whose sole reason to be in the movie is so the good guys can get it together and move the plot along"". This is is the 4th one of these kind to be in a DCEU movie and it has only been 5 movies. And this one is the worst of it after Enchantress. He is a great fighter for sure but that's pretty much everything about this guy.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The plot. Or the lack thereof. After Mr. Snyder temporarily stepped away from the project, WB decided to remove a huge chunk of the movie. And to make things worse, they reshot and heavily changed the rest of it. In the end, this movie has such a simple plot it's barely enough to fill an episode in a TV show. The mother boxes are the definitive version of McGuffins. Every scene and dialogue is full of heavy exposition and takes the fast lane to the third act. this can be very annoying to the viewers who aren't familiar with the comics or the characters.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>WB and Whedon. Seriously WB, at what point did you start to think a ""story problem"" in a movie can be fixed by hiring the same director who did Age of Ultron, let him completely rewrite the ending along with some of the most crucial stuff in the movie while adding an unhealthy amount of unnecessary CGI, quips and digitally removed moustaches. Way to f*** things up at the last minute WB. this is the least Zack Snyderesque Zack Snyder movie ever and not in any good way. You should have released his original cut as is instead of you know, trying to pander the movie into literally everyone in the world.</li></ul><br/><br/>So I think you get my opinion of the movie. It's far from perfect but still it's progress. If you aren't familiar with the comics or the DC characters, It's possible you won't enjoy this movie since it doesn't bother to explain much as it goes along. But if you're a fan of DC and JL even by a little bit. There's a lot for you in this. Because finally, finally, the Justice League is on the big screen and you can actually cheer for them and be inspired by them.<br/><br/>P.S - You better not mess what you teased at the end of credits WB. I'm a huge fan. But the the day you mess that up is the day I'm done with these movies."
"Lewis_Heather787","6","1","4","18 November 2017"," The Future looks bright for the DC Cinematic Universe!
","Justice League is here, can we all actually just process that in our minds that a live action film of JL has been made, some of us me included never thought the day would come. I'm a film fan first and foremost and like both Marvel and DC comic book films, for the reason that they are both extremely different tones and themes, I would say that I slightly prefer DC because the darker tone suits me better. <br/><br/>History of the film, the overall product and response.<br/><br/>This film had a lot of hurdles to overcome to say the least even before the film entered production and whilst it was in production. 1) The reaction from critics and fan's to both Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad were negative, even though the films did have some redeeming features to them 2)Due to this reaction Warner bros and DC made the decision to move towards are more lighter tone, hence the number of jokes in JL. 3)Also there is the personal tragedy of Zack Snyder which is unthinkable and horrifying for anyone to go through, this obviously resulted in Joss Whedon coming in to take over the film. This change in hands over the film then results in the mass amount of re-shoots that were undertaken in this film in an extremely short amount of time. <br/><br/>After reading reviews for the film the concussion I got was that there is going to be a clear divide in opinion between fans and critics, even more than previous entries which is hard to believe. With some critics even going as far as to say that the film is even worse than Batman &Robin, god forbid!!<br/><br/>The Film.<br/><br/>Yes, I personally thought that there was enough good in the film for me to give it a positive review, which is a credit to the hard work put in during the re-shoots and throughout the whole roller-coaster of a production.<br/><br/>The Cast <br/><br/>If this is Ben Affleck's last performance as Batman then I tip my hat to you sir you have done a fine job in stepping into the shoes left by Christian Bale, I know its a separate universe. Affleck is great again in the role as Batman and Bruce Wayne, even now and then coming in with a few one liners that actually work. Gal Gadot is again a standout was Wonder Woman/ Diana Prince brings everything that we love about the character from her solo film into this one. She is the heart of the film and some so really good scenes with Affleck, their chemistry is very good. Now the three new characters firstly Ezra Miller as The Flash, I thought he was OK, I would be interested in seeing a standalone film to establish his character a bit more because even though what we got with him and his father was good I was left wanting more. Next is Jason Momoa as Aquaman, his portrayal in the film has made me reconsider the character completed he was fantastic in the film and I now cant wait until next year to see his solo film. Lastly Ray Fisher who plays Cyborg, is also extremely good in the film and actually a focal point of the story throughout which was surprising but again really good performance. All of them work extremely well together as a cast and as a team, the dynamic of the team is all I wanted and needed absolute brilliantly written and directed.<br/><br/>Other performances such as Henry Cavill was great once again as Superman, I've thought he was great in all the films so far so having him back and completing the Death of Superman arc was really nice. Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Jeremy Irons, JK Simmons, Billy Crudup and Amber Heard are all really good in their small roles. Green Lantern and Deathstroke, just Yes!<br/><br/>The Negatives<br/><br/>The CGI, yes for a reported $300 million film you would think that the CGI would be top class however for some strange reason this film has some very bad CGI. Firstly on removing Henry Cavill's moustache, mission impossible 6 better be good now after this, is bad but its only like that for a while. The end fight just like with BVS, Suicide Squad and Wonder Women the end is just a CGI mess which is of putting. <br/><br/>The Story and the humour of the film for me are extremely weak for this type of film and for the latter I don't believe it works in a DC film, that has to be Whedon's work because if you just heard the audio you'd believe its a Marvel film. This is what I feared would happen and unfortunately it just doesn't work all the time, if this trend continues then comic book films will become over saturated because there the same and light in tone. The story is very weak and basic which is also probably due to the mass re-shoots but it wavers in and out and sometimes doesn't add up which is sad to see because this is not a transformers film its the Justice League and they definitely deserve better. <br/><br/>Overall the film is 60% out of 100 or 6 out of 10, The major problems with once again story and structure its what lets this film down for me that along with the increase in humour that doesn't work all the time and almost morphs into a marvel film at times. However doesn't the Future of the DC cinematic universe look good with all theses amazing characters and possibilities, this is the end of Snyder esk films and the beginning of something special, DC will get there in the end I have hope. Better than BVS and Suicide Squad but not than Man of Steel or Wonder Woman."

","This was a really, really, REALLY good movie. <br/><br/>I generally avoid anything DC puts out -I have yet to see the wonder woman movie honestly- So I went into this one with no expectations what so ever. <br/><br/>This could have taken a few deadend turns along the way easily... BUT it didn't.<br/><br/>Superman was the hero that actually cares about civilians, he had a sense of humor and he actually smiled here. A DC character that actually smiles without being holier then thou!!! Also and this is a big also, he's suit has colour! imagine that, a DC movie with colours!<br/><br/>Unlike Suicide Squad that spent a full hour on character intro before throwing it away and going friendship is magic. This one allows the characters to introduce themselves for a few minutes before they each actually act according to that character. Be it joining the team full of youthful eagerness or just put up the middle finger and walk away. <br/><br/>The movie was entertaining, bright and interesting from beginning to end. Worth the watch.<br/><br/>It lost a star because the special effects where a bit distracting, especially on cyborg and at the very end. They needed some work however they weren't horrendous. Ben Affleck's Batman was a bit weird here but it was less the actor and more the script. The lines were very hit or miss."
"randykellyjr","8","1","4","18 November 2017"," Very Entertaining Film
","I went into this film Open minded and hopeful that it was at least A good movie. And on that level it did not disappoint. The tone of this film has made a slight shift from the previous DC films. Yet not enough to be super out of place in the DCU. And I think that is in part due to the Fact that Joss Weddon had a hand in helping Zach Snyder push this production across the finish line. It does fit in nicely as a follow up to Wonder Woman. Although not to say as solid as Wonder Woman, yet a step up from Suicide Squad for sure and even BvS. So it is a nice course correction for the DCU in conjunction with the fore mentioned Wonder Woman. Now the story Does have some week points as it does get slightly lost but not terribly like the above mentioned Suicide Squad. Now where this movie excelled was in it's building of Character relationships, and not just one or two but all of them. it does it so well in fact that even when they switch up the pairing of Characters throughout the film, I found myself able to really enjoy spending time with them. It did suffer from some bad CGI in places throughout the film and I did feel the villain was week. But before someone goes ""aHAH! See they can't get that right!"" MOST of the time neither can Marvel. So in this case the Villain really only served as Plot device to unite the Hero's. And because of their strong interactions and very enjoyable screen presence, I can forgive that in this case. And I can find some forgiveness for the Bad CGI because the action is crafted in a fun way and again the moments with the Characters in those action scenes where so well done that it tipped the scales back to positive for me. So over all my first viewing of this film I would give it a solid 82% for solid characters, fun and re-watch-ability. I look forward more optimistically for the future DC Films now than I did before. Oh treat yourself and stay for both end credits scenes. They are worth it."

"bora_mustafa","9","1","4","18 November 2017"," Ignore the critics, Justice League is a very entertaining superhero movie!!
","I must admit I didn't expect this movie to be as good as it was, but I'm happy to say that Justice League is a very entertaining movie. Let's get the bad out the way:<br/><br/>I agree that the movie does feel a little rushed and some of the characters such as Steppenwolf is not given enough depth. Admittedly some of the CGI, especially Cyborg and the parademons looked a bit off but again nothing to really detract from the movie.<br/><br/>Now for everything that I did like:<br/><br/>The story borrows heavily from the Justice League animated movie ""War"", the only difference is that the villain is Steppenwolf rather than Darkseid. Basically Batman (Ben Affleck) is forming a team of superheroes to combat the parademons who are slowly invading the earth after Steppenwolf attempts to collect the three motherboxes to bring Apocalypse to the earth and basically destroy it. I'm sure there's a better way of explaining it but I'll keep it short. Now on to each character:<br/><br/>Batman – Ben Affleck once again proves that he is a great Batman, he seems more controlled here rather than the vigilante he was in the previous movie Batman v Superman, I enjoyed his portrayal.<br/><br/>Superman – We all knew he was returning, and he returns with a bang!! I was slowly getting used to Henry Cavill's portrayal of the man of steel and to date this is easily his finest performance and believe me his return is worth the wait.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman – Gal Gadot continues to impress as Wonder Woman, I really can't wait for her second solo movie, plus she's hot!!! <br/><br/>The Flash/Barry Allen – Turned out to be quite a surprise, I didn't expect Ezra Miller to be this good as the Flash, most of his comedic moments are pure gold. <br/><br/>Cyborg/Victor Stone – Though I'm not too familiar with Ray Fisher, I must admit his character as Cyborg is very interesting and I really hope we get a solo movie with him as a bit more back story is necessary, plus he's the one character you really feel sorry for as you can't help but feel his pain as he tries to come to terms with what he's become.<br/><br/>Aquaman/Arthur Curry – This was the one character I was worried about as the actor Jason Momoa just doesn't look anything like the Aquaman from the animated series. But I'm happy to say he does a good job as Aquaman and yes there are some jokes from him too.<br/><br/>The rest of the main characters, Lois Lane (Amy Addams), Alfred (Jeremy Irons), Commissioner Gordon (J.K Simmons) are all great. I was also happy to see most of the Amazonian cast return. <br/><br/>Overall the movie really surprised me, it's not perfect by all means and there are flaws but if you are able to overlook this, you will have a great time. And for the record, I am no DC or Marvel specific fan boy but I will say that this movie is far better than the recent Thor Ragnarok movie and even better than the recent Spiderman movie and that's saying something."

And sure, why not do that, as long as opinions aren't biased. But they are. They highly are.<br/><br/>Justice League was a fun movie with a solid storyline and a great way to introduce the heroes one by one. Instead of heading deep into the never before seen on-screen heroes' origin stories, Justice League focuses on the manner in which to bring them together. Aquaman was a fun character, and I realized that as soon as Bruce confronted him.<br/><br/>The Flash is a show-stealer, and as I've believed since the first trailer, he pulls off the character of Barry Allen better than the CW version. He's fun, really really fun. And his team spirit is better than Diana's smile (that's hard to beat!).<br/><br/>Ray Fisher has done justice to Cyborg. And so has Jason Momoa as Aquaman. Warner Bros. may not be pushing out the greatest movies but it is pushing out the greatest characters ever made. Played by actors who couldn't have done better. Cyborg is both a brooding and a fun character and well... Ray Fisher you are awesome.<br/><br/>And you, Mr. Affleck. You can't and won't go anywhere. The cowl has had many people go into it, but your head is the one that fits best. It's just as magnificent as Mark Hamill becoming the voice of the Joker. I've seen so many Batman movies, but your ability to pull off Bruce Wayne... it feels right. It feels great. ""Save one person. Then you'll know."" If you don't leave the role, you've saved me. And then you'll know what it feels like. YOU ARE BATMAN. Bruce Wayne isn't Batman. Ben Affleck is. <br/><br/>Henry Cavill. Unless you can go Superman on Tom Cruise's ass in MI:6 LOSE THE STUPID MUSTACHE. The CGI messed up the perfect Superman face. But your portrayal of Superman will go down in history as the best. EVER. You've done well for yourself with Superman, and stop playing World of Warcraft. You're gonna miss another important call someday. (Look it up.)<br/><br/>Steppenwolf was a generic Cliché villain. But he's evil. And well done. I can only imagine how beautiful Darkseid will be. Ciaren Hinds, great job. Screw the hate. Steppenwolf was a great villain in the movie, and he's given great competition to the great heroes in a great movie. GREAT! i'm gonna stop now...<br/><br/>All in all, you're missing an experience if you don't watch this movie. It's like not watching Star Wars or Breaking Bad. <br/><br/>This movie is beautiful. The only part I don't like was Themyscira. It irritates the **** out of me. Hippolyta is boring. Amazons with bows and arrows and spears trying to fight an army of Parademons with lasers? That's pitiful. And boring as hell. Thank god it lasted for like two minutes."
"noloxtreme","6","1","4","17 November 2017"," Justice League: Superhero movie done by the numbers
","Well congratulations comic book fanboys. You've done it. When Jack Snyder and DC set out to create these DC films they wanted to do something different from Marvel. They had a different style and different vision and different direction.<br/><br/>But due to the cinematic palette of the average viewer being unsophisticated and comic book fanboys; the studio and director were beaten into submission. And the original direction they had in mind has since been abandoned to create a set of movies that do it by the numbers. We've almost seen everything here done before. Note, I don't think a movie has to be different in order to be enjoyable-it can certainly have things we have seen before, but the film is extremely formulaic. 1. Thousands of throwaway and easily disposable alien/robot henchmen. 2. An obscure villain you've never heard of unless you're a huge comic book fan (Whose steppen-wolf?). 3. Some sort of beam in the sky, or some tower or some sort of gizmo to be destroyed or the world will end. 4. Little to no lasting consequences.<br/><br/>Now while I don't think a film has to have a dark tone to be enjoyable, but since the backlash against actual consequences occurring in Man of Steel. The DC film offers after Man of Steel have been consequence free. You get these extremely powerful enemies that can wreak havoc, but very little civilian casualties. You get the scene where superman leaves fighting Steppen-wolf to go and help out a couple of civilians. Okay!? End-of-world or go help single family in car?<br/><br/>But I don't blame the studio or director. Give the people what they want. Once superhero movie fatigue sets in, maybe they could then try again to do what they had been going for in the beginning.<br/><br/>This is a question I've always had? Why was it not okay for Superman to kill Zod but it's okay for him and other superhero's to kill the parademons and doomsday? Killing is killing isn't it? I noticed the scene at the end where the justice league let the parademons attack Steppen-wolf instead of them finishing the job. Okay!? It's what the fans want I guess and film makers must find a way of disposing of the villains without causing offense.<br/><br/>Anyways, solid movie, I'll give it a 6. But I don't blame the studio, they just want a return on their investment."

It was fun, action was great, and the actors were perfectly cast. Ezra Miller and Jason Momoa really shined. The Joss Whedon forced one liners were very cringey at times, actually heard a few groans at the ""thirsty"" line, and Danny Elfman needs to retire from soundtrack making.

","I saw ""Justice League"", starring Ben Affleck-Live By Night, He's Just Not That Into You; Gal Gadot-Keeping Up With the Joneses, Knight and Day; Ezra Miller-Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Trainwreck; Jason Momoa-Bullet to the Head, Game of Thrones_tv; Ray Fisher-In his first movie, not counting his brief cameo in Batman v Superman and the voice of Ciaran Hinds-Game of Thrones_tv, The Woman in Black. This is the movie I've been waiting for. All the big guns from DC in one movie-well, most of the big guns, anyways-Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg. After Batman v Superman-which I thought looked great but the story could have been better-I was a little worried how this one would turn out. It has the same director, Zack Snyder, but this one actually did turn out better, which might be because I read that Joss Whedon came in to finish the movie after Zack had a death in his family. This one starts right after Batman v Superman ended, with Henry/Superman being dead and criminals are having a field day running rampant through the streets. Ben/Batman is trying to keep things under control when he comes across a para-demon- a winged insect looking creature from Apokolipse, an evil planet under the control of Darkseid. Ben consults with Gal/Wonder Woman, who has knowledge of the para-demons and their current boss, Ciaran/Steppenwolf-a general that works for Darkseid. Ben tries to round up any and all metahumans he can find, which include Ezra/Flash, Jason/Aquaman and Ray/Cyborg. Mother Boxes play a big part in the plot-comic book fans know what I'm talking about. They are a sophisticated technology that looks like a square box, but they are very powerful and sometimes used to teleport between places a lot. Another thing I liked was that they used the song from the trailers- Come Together as covered by Gary Clarke Jr-in the end credits. There is a brief scene where a combatant-who wears a powerful piece of jewelry-is spotted in a battle and there are 2 scenes at the very end. One as the end credits start-a recreation of a famous story line from the comics-and one after the credits-a teaser with 2 villains giving plot points to the next movie. It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci-fi violence and action and has a running time of 1 hour & 59 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"azeron40","7","1","4","17 November 2017"," A good movie, but
","The cast, the acting, the chemistry, are all awesome. The problem I have is, I think too much of the movie was left on the cutting room floor. Yes I know it was a 2 hour movie, but just like Suicide Squad there were scenes in the movie trailers that were not in the finished film. Too much was missing from the story, it was choppy, and rushed. Yes I understand most people do not want to spend 3 hours at a movie, and long movies tend to slow down the action, but this is done at the expense of character development, and a comprehensive and cohesive story. I can only hope that they add in all the scenes, that we didn't get to see on the Blu-ray. As usual they were so close to an awesome movie with the DCEU. Is it worth seeing: Definitely Could it have been much better: Definitely<br/><br/>The next few days will tell, I truly hope the movie is a huge success, but with the reviews and ratings so far, and with the huge budget, reshoots, and mustache wipes, it will likely squeak by, at best."

"dothancore","7","1","4","17 November 2017"," Very decent, but not the best super hero movie I have seen this year
","First of all, I don't give a crap about what the critics say, to me, they are a bunch of idiots who have no connection to the fan base. That being said, my personal take of this Justice League installment is quite mixed.<br/><br/>This is a typical Snyder movie - a lot of explosions, a lot of fighting scenes, and 40 more buildings got demolished along the way (he probably destroyed a couple of hundreds in the few movies he directed). <br/><br/>Although I enjoy the movie, my main critiques are the following: <br/><br/>1) Not much character development – unlike Man of Steel, which has great moments of deep, touching emotions, that made superman relatable to us humans, the JL is pretty much just about superheroes fighting on our behalf. I don't really feel connected. Also IMO the Flash, the cyborg, and Batman are miscast (yes, 3 out of the 5). Ben is probably a bit too old for the role, and why they didn't choose Grant for the Flash role is just beyond me. I really like his take of the role much better than Ezra's. Also the cyborg - come on guys, can't the CGI do a bit better job? The cyborg seems overweight and ugly.<br/><br/>2) The plot - it just feels forced. I am not even sure why the Aquaman is needed. I think to justify his existence, they had to bring a couple of scenes with underground water, but really his part can be done by another superhero. Also, they foreclosed superman's family home? Seriously, which bank would want to bring that kind of negative publicity to its name? Especially when the world seems to be deeply mourning superman's passing ... just didn't make sense.<br/><br/>3) Chemistry - really not much between the main characters. I'd hope for some bromance, or fatherly love (like the Ironman towards Spiderman), or some romance – really none. The band of Justice League boiled down to a bunch of comrades or office colleagues.<br/><br/>Overall, I do think it is a decent movie & entertaining, but I honestly will NOT put it on top of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" or ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"", or ""Thor: Ragnarok"" or ""Wonder Woman"", or ""Logan"", all of which are fantastic examples how a superhero movie should have been done."
"kailomonkey","8","1","4","17 November 2017"," A fine watch.
","Justice League is a lot faster moving than Dawn of Justice and a lot less torn apart than Suicide Squad. It hits the mark the same as Wonder Woman in being palatable and giving some of the heart back to our old superhero friends.<br/><br/>Batman and Wonder Woman are back and are pretty good. Aqua Man has a great attitude. The Flash is a slightly unfunny kid. Green Lantern only appears in a flashback and the fifth member of the league is instead Cyborg in his early development who is black and unnecessarily played for race humour.<br/><br/>The villain starts off okay but he isn't focused on very well at all and despite being more powerful than each individual, I felt he could have been defeated by the above 5 heroes combined. However they go ahead and bring Superman back making the villain zero challenge which is the biggest problem the film has.<br/><br/>Rant time. Doomsday in the previous Justice film was a suitably epic foe that required Superman's involvement but this foe really didn't need Superman resurrected yet and me having avoided trailers, them doing so surprised me. Fair enough the reason was partly pinned to Batman's guilt but with a foe already on the scene, it just seemed irresponsible to risk bringing a rogue Superman into the picture.<br/><br/>It also surprised me from a larger franchise point of view as the foe, as I've said, could have easily been defeated by a bit of effort by the other 5. They could have kept Superman returning for the next movie at least, with a much larger fight on their hands. This leads to another issue which was probably in the comics too, that Superman is over powered. He's not a great team member as he overshadow's everyone's abilities being as fast as The Flash etc. All the more reason to leave him dead as long as possible. Anyway that's the personal rant over. I do think they dented their opportunity to make lots of character focused movies which I would love to have seen, but understand they might not have the confidence in the results from past experiences which is a shame.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was quite agreeable. I loved the rogue Superman even though it didn't last long. They treated Superman well (he's my favourite superhero/character) and redeemed both him and Batman from their broody hatred of one-another. A fine watch."

"randy_orton_fan","Null","1","4","17 November 2017"," The Original Super Team Hits the Big Screen
","The movie is being slammed by critics. My guess is because it's not full of jokes and jokes and poop jokes and more jokes and isn't an insult to the intelligence like Thor: Ragnarok, which they hilariously have at over 90% on RT even though that movie was terrible.<br/><br/>The movie is about the world still grieving over the death of Superman, and as Steppenwolff arrives on Earth to collect the Mother Boxes, Batman and Wonder Woman are forced to recruit other people like them. Each one with their own unique personality and character (something Marvel isn't very good at, considering everyone in the MCU is ""The Funny One)<br/><br/>The action was great. The characters were dynamic and interesting and there was actual chemistry between the cast. When they got into it arguing over whether or not to bring Superman back, it didn't feel forced and generic and an attempt to force chemistry like in the two Avengers movies.<br/><br/>Steppenwolff is being blasted by critics for not being interesting, but he had much more going for him as a character than the scrubs in the MCU. You actually felt like he was a real threat, one that would take a team of heroes to combat, unlike Loki who was just throwing a temper tantrum or Ultron who was just telling jokes and wanted to throw a rock at the Earth.<br/><br/>Everything with Superman was great, from seeing Lois coping with his death, to his resurrection, to him and Lois on the farm, and finally when he joins the final fight against Steppenwolff. They didn't have the John Williams Superman theme in the film, my guess is Whedon chopped it out because he was offended that Superman wasn't brought back by baseball cards or ""Just Because"" like when MCU characters come back.<br/><br/>The movie is being panned, but it just shows how out of touch the critics really are. They expect every movie to be a Mickey Mouse joke fest that focuses on humor over character and anything else.<br/><br/>It was refreshing to see the heroes actually fight the main villain for a change in a team-up movie. Unlike in The Avengers where the main villain was beaten very easily by one Avenger (Loki in a comedy sequence that ruined his character and Ultron by Scarlet Witch when she threw a fit about her brother being slower than bullets).<br/><br/>The Lasso of Truth scene with Aquaman was great. I laughed, and it was funny because it was actually funny, not just a forced joke like the MCU.<br/><br/>Flash stole the show, and was a highlight every scene he appeared in. He has a great scene with Superman in the mid-credits, which was a throw back to the classic story where Superman and Flash had a race to see who was faster, and it even did a slow-mo shot that was reminiscent of the cover to that issue. THe post-credit scene showed Lex Luthor and Deathstroke, teasing the Legion of Doom.<br/><br/>Wasn't an amazing movie. But I loved it. It was fun, the action was great, the characters actually had character and they each played their part in the finale unlike in the bloated Avengers movies where Thor did a few lighting shots but not much else.<br/><br/>Give it a chance. Put the biased critics who want everything to be pratfalls and anus jokes to the side and form your own opinion. If you see it for yourself and judge it for yourself, it was a good movie. Not great. But good. And I'm glad to see the original super team on the big screen, the team Stan Lee copied with the Avengers.<br/><br/>Hope when the BLu-ray comes out we can see the Snyder cut, to see all of the things Whedon obviously chopped out."

"ilovebreadandsoup","8","1","4","17 November 2017"," Good, not Great. B-
","Justice League is a good movie with memorable scenes and characters. The movie itself relies more on the cohesion between the team members and their personalities than overcoming the villain. However, that is what makes this movie not as good as it could be.<br/><br/>The villain, Steppenwolf, is flat, dull-looking, and non-threatening. I can only blame this on WB reshoots and Snyder leaving the film due to a personal crisis. BvS set up Apokolips and Darkseid to be major threats, but as it turns out, they are not. Again, a majority of the film is the interaction with the characters and their different personalities, and their dislike of one another. That is really what makes this film work.<br/><br/>In short, JL is a fun film with many positive elements. To me, Snyder's films comes across as as film versions of comic books, replete with robust visuals and imagery. Unfortunately, this book has a few pages missing (just enough to notice, but not enough to distract) and has two different artists (Snyder and Whedon) painting their vision. It's good, but not great."

Aquaman was a very cool character and i cant wait to find out more about him . There were some cool cameos . One thing i was worried about though while going into the movie was that it may show consistency of tones since it had two directors but the story moves smoothly along with a consistent tone . There is such a great dynamic between these characters.Dc finally gets it completely right.

"rikflaire","8","1","4","17 November 2017"," Justice League: Loaded with flaws but overall a ""feel good"" pleaser
","Pay no attention to critics that take this movie too seriously. I'm both a Marvel and D.C. fan and judge without bias. With that said Justice League was without a doubt a fun movie to watch! I was nervous about the quality/success of the film since A LOT is riding on it! After all, if JL bombed it would seriously jeopardize projects like Flashpoint, Aquaman, The Batman, MOS 2, and yes JL 2 from ever being made. After watching the film I'm confident that at least the next wave of DC's projects are a safe bet. However, the skeptic in me pondered why there were sooooo many flaws in the movie with such a big budget! Aside from the Amazonians, JL cast, and CGI demon moths....where were the people of the world? If they were hiding they should've showed news broadcasts telling everyone to hide. Instead, the movie ignored showing the impact of how the invasion was affecting the general public... aside from a single family residing near the Steppenwolf's hive. There were literally scenes filmed in open public areas with no extras in the background! at one point, Superman and Flash left the final battle to save civilians....but Flash only saved one family of 4 and Superman was shown carrying a building with no people in it?! Details left out in this movie we're inexcusable and was much more of a live action cartoon rather than a movie to be taken seriously. Steppenwolf was also a VERY poor choice for D.C. to select as the main villain. He lacked relevance, and is completely unknown even to knowledgeable comic fans. When Goyer was mulling over historical villains....how/why would they skip over more well known villains like Brainiac, or Darkseid?! At least the credits scene painted a picture of a more relevant future with Luthor's potential band of villains.<br/><br/>OK enough of the bad and onto the good! The Flash stole the show, and I thought Aquaman was going to be a zero but was pleasantly surprised! The movie focused on ""the team"" and rightfully so. WW was her fabulous self and Superman came back as strong as ever. The ""team"" aspect the movie hit a homerun! The best fight scene in the movie was the resurrection of Superman. What a great surprise twist! ....and enough bashing on Ben....he's done a fine job as Batman and fits well with the direction DC's taken. We need more scenes like in the opening where Batman caught the scout demon. The stealthy creepy Batman scenes are fantastic and D.C. needs to capitalize on more scenes like it. Hopefully D.C. can build (with Ben) on the progress they've made with JL. I'd say that's exactly how to describe the movie....""progress"". I walked in nervous, but walked out smiling."
"leeaf83","8","1","4","17 November 2017"," DC finally expands it's horizons bringing the league together on the big screen to lukewarm results.
","Ben Affleck owns the cowl and doesn't disappoint. Both his interrogation techniques and fighting skills resemble something out of an Arkham game. Batman doesn't kill any humans this time around but he shows off his wonderful toys. Gal Gadot is on her game again, her character becomes just as important as Bruce Wayne especially early in the film bringing the team together. Her lasso becomes her version of a utility belt and doesn't go to waste. Superman is far closer to the character than his previous portrayals. Metropolis and it's Man of steel are portrayed lighter and brighter this time around, differentiating their world from Batman and Gotham. Henry Cavill really shows his acting range here giving us an altered version of the character from the last time we saw him Cyborg feels somewhat cut down, the character isn't fleshed out as much as he could have been. The scenes we get are a treat though, Cyborg's hacking abilities are showcased. Victor Stone has a complex relationship with his father which is hinted at but not fully developed. Aquaman is portrayed similar to his presence in the New 52. Far less comedic relief and silly, and more tough and edgy. Jason Momoa gives us a character we don't need to feel ashamed cheering for, of the six heroes featured here, one could argue Aquaman is the most badass. Barry Allen is still early in his career, learning what he can do. Nothing against the TV show but it is nice seeing the Flash have to make decisions on his own without having a team at S.T.A.R. labs in his ear telling him what to do. Showing a flawed and somewhat sloppy hero helps ground the story and allows the audience to relate more to the humanity of a character who possesses a power we can only dream off. Steppenwolf is less than impressive. Great name, mediocre character. He's not a bad villain but he isn't delightful and menacing the way Loki was in the Avengers, nor were his motivations as developed as Loki's. Instead we have another monster looking to take over the world because that's something he likes to do. Certainly a powerful and fearsome villain but not an overly memorable one. <br/><br/>Overall I liked how every character meant something unique to the team. Some may question if Aquaman needed to be there. He does as Atlantis while rarely shown plays a key part in the film's plot as does the Amazon. Danny Elfman gives some nods to the classic Batman and Superman themes though the score is merely acceptable. Danny doesn't crank out any new scores likely to become part of his classics. One problem which has plagued every DCEU film without 'Wonder Woman' in the title is the uneven tones of the films. Man of Steel has a heavy Christopher Nolan influence at certain parts, Batman V Superman suffered from tonal shifts due to the editing, and Suicide Squad was all over the pace. Despite having two directors, Justice League keeps a steady flow, even if it is flowing slightly too fast for some moviegoers. Inevitably with this project cut down from two films to one 121 minute film, useful content will be left on the cutting room floor. At the end of the day this leaves many fans including me wanting more. Luckily we'll get our chance, either via an extended cut or sequel. Take your pick but either way I can't wait for more from these characters."

Their interaction with each other was very entertaining, similar to how the Avengers interact with each other in the first Avengers movie. They all were very interesting and I can't wait to see their future solo movies. And when Superman come out, whoa, that was amazing. Of the three new great characters-Aquaman, Cyborg, Flash-my favorite one I like was Cyborg, which was surprising because I thought from the trailers he was going to be the worst one. And they finally gave Superman a sense of being optimistic, hopeful-no more being depress or cynical.<br/><br/>Now the bad-the villain. Steppenwolf is one of the worst, bland, colorless villain in modern superheros movies. I mean come on, I seen more grey statues with more color, life than him. He look awful, his dialogue was so generic, and all he did was spin his axe around. The parademons were okay for what they were being used for. And the plot is something we seen so many times before; an alien invasion and some big bad that wants to destroy the world. But in retrospect, all superheros movies plot have this issue. Its just the way they each execute their plots, villain, and in this movie, they could have done a better job on that.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was very entertaining to watch due to its characters. The movie did felt rush at times and some scenes just...ended. The villain was bland, the same old plot, and there was lot of cgi at the end of the movie.

","'Justice League' marks the culmination of an unofficial trilogy that began with the flawed but fascinating 'Man of Steel' and continued with the ponderous but polarizing 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'. Unfortunately for DC, the deck was stacked against it from the beginning of this 'Avengers'-style teamup – not only did critical and commercial derision of 'BvS' force a change in tone from the grim grandiosity of its predecessor, a personal tragedy led its director Zack Synder to step away late into production, with Joss Whedon stepping in to punch up the banter as well as complete post- production work on the film. Both considerations will certainly colour fans' perception of 'JL', though if one is prepared to set aside these biases and comparisons with this-and-that Marvel and/or DC comic-book movie that's come before it, you'll find a fun, charming and even uplifting movie at its core.<br/><br/>In Synder's trademark style, the opening credits set to the Leonard Cohen/ Sharon Robinson classic 'Everybody Knows' reminds us of Superman's (Henry Cavill) passing via a headline in an old issue of the Gotham Free Press. His absence has left Batman (Ben Affleck) dealing not just with the lowly criminals on the street but also the possibility of a more malevolent evil, whose impending appearance is heralded by its scouts of winged metallic vampire-like creatures. Halfway around the planet, Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) is dealing with a London besieged by anarchists looking to take advantage of Superman's death; although when a huge fire goes off at the ancient Statue of the Amazonians, she similarly realizes that a much more powerful force of destruction may be imminent.<br/><br/>So the pair set off to recruit the titular league of superheroes – the fully tattooed Aquaman (Jason Momoa) from the tiny Iceland town of Djupavik; the haunted half-man, half-machine Cyborg (Ray Fisher); and last but not least the glib-tongued but even more lightning-paced The Flash (Ezra Miller). These three characters are appearing in DC's Extended Universe for the first time, and co-writers Chris Terrio and Whedon ensure that they all get due emphasis amidst the ensemble. Including Batman and Wonder Woman, each one of these characters have to face up to their respective inner demons before confronting the supervillian Steppenwolf (an unrecognizable Ciaran Hinds) and his army of Parademons – Batman has to get over his guilt of indirectly causing Superman's death; Wonder Woman is still reeling inside from the death of her one true love Steve Trevor (remember Chris Pine from this summer's 'Wonder Woman'?); Aquaman has to overcome his fear of isolation in order to work with the team; Cyborg has to deal with the angst from being a living abomination; and The Flash has to conquer fear of his own inexperience in the heat of battle.<br/><br/>Truth be told, it was never going to be easy bringing each one of these superheroes into the same movie without diluting their own distinctive identities, personalities and idiosyncrasies, or for that matter without coming over as a jumble of five or six mini-movies, but Synder (no doubt with assist from Whedon) manages to do so not just coherently but even compellingly. This isn't a dark Batman movie, nor a sunny Wonder Woman movie, but one perfectly balanced on hope, gravitas and gloom. <br/><br/>Oh yes, unlike the out-and-out circus act that was 'Thor: Ragnarok', 'JL' mixes comedy, drama and action deftly so that it never sacrifices one for the other. There is humour and fun in the way the superheroes riff each other; there is drama in the tussle between the characters about how far they are willing to go in the name of expediency versus ethics (hint: it's about bringing Superman back to life); and there are a couple of electrifying action sequences, including one set within the cavernous tunnels underneath Gotham Harbour where they first get a taste of Steppenwolf's might and the CGI-heavy finale where the complete alliance (yes, including the Man of Steel himself) get to demonstrate their individual powers as well as what they are capable of when they finally learn to work together as a team. You'll find plenty of cheer-worthy moments whether you're a fan or a casual viewer, and even some surprising poignancy from the emotional reunion between Superman and his family.<br/><br/>Credit for that goes to Synder/Whedon and to the A-list actors/actresses that have become invaluable to the DCEU – Affleck as Batman is front and centre of course, but his overbearing bitterness in 'BvS' is now moderated by purpose and even optimism; Gadot is as magnetic and in command of her role as ever, and fans need not be worried that she is playing second fiddle here; Momoa is a vibrant larger-than-life presence who will leave you looking forward to his solo outing next Christmas; and Miller is a delightful mix of earnestness, enthusiasm and naiveté. <br/><br/>We'll be honest that we're completely disgusted by the vitriol that some critics have heaped onto 'JL' – one calls it a 'big, bloated, superhero mess' – that we think is motivated by their utter bias against the DCEU than any objective basis of assessment. In fact, we enjoyed 'JL' a lot more than we expected, and that's not because we had low expectations to begin with. It's too tempting to try to reinvent the superhero genre what with the current and upcoming deluge of comic-book movies, but this is a perfect example of how not to lose your raison de'etre in the process. Sure there are generous (and we may add, genuine) laughs here, but never at the expense of diminishing the mission and/or stakes of saving the world. Ignore all the naysayers – 'JL' concludes the trilogy and kicks off a new league of superheroes (and supervillains, though you'll have to stay till the end of the credits to know what this means) on a rousing high."

It mimics some of the best and worst of tropes from the Marvel Cinematic Universe- two after credits scenes, plenty of humor and witty banter between superheroes to satisfy fans who left feeling drained from Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, and a hopeful outlook for a universe that is repeatedly dipped in potential doom and destruction; much like the reputation of the DC Cinematic Universe itself.<br/><br/>More so than Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice; Justice League progresses the events of the DC Cinematic Universe, but more organically along with hints to a hopefully better sequel, and easter eggs that had my inner geek jumping for joy.<br/><br/>However; it carries the burden of some set pieces being too hyperactive for most attentive viewers, awkward humor in serious moments, a mostly predictable narrative, and for this being one of the most expensive movies ever made; a villain as forgettable as Steppenwolf is poppycock on part of the writers and Warner Bros. or DC who could excuse a violation like this (especially considering this is a culmination of years of material Warner Bros. has been giddy to adapt, maybe these heroes deserve a worthwhile villain).<br/><br/>If you're one looking for another joyride with some of the top dogs of DC Comics, or a fan seeking closure with years of anticipation; this is your excursion.

"voyager-95288","7","1","4","16 November 2017"," A Good Entertaining Movie
","I liked this movie a lot, I would be in love with this movie if the story line is a lot better. I just wish the Execs at WB would just leave the movies alone, anything they touch they ruin the movie experience. BvS they didn't allow the 3 hour long, so we got the jumbled mess and I liked BvS, love the Ultimate Edition. I hated Suicide Squad and it was again the WB Execs changed the vision of the director. I LOVE Wonder Woman and again the WB Execs almost messed it up by not wanting the no man's land scene which became one of the best Scene in Super Hero movies. Now Justice League the Moron at WB said the movie has to be only 2 hours when in fact when you watch this movie there were parts where they jumped around and you like what happened and you knew there were parts missing. The Movie was originally 2hrs and 45min, cutting 45 minutes is cutting 1/3 of the movie and this is why it has a lot of terrible ratings from critics which I think has it in for DC anyway because Marvel can't do no wrong. Justice League is a true Super Hero movie, the characters were awesome, I just wished they had more arguments between the characters because they came together and work together too quickly. This is what this film was, very quick. My favorite Character is the Flash, coming in, I didn't like him in the Trailer because his face does not look right, he just looks weird, but Ezra created his own version of the flash and he was very funny. Enjoyed him in every Scene. A surprising character is Cyborg, had to get used to the bland talk but it works out at the end and strangely enough you become attached to him. Aquaman I knew was going to be Cool and so was Batman, I just hope Ben does not quit as Batman, really like his batman, like his Bruce even more. Wonder Woman, well, is Wonder Woman she shines again, she's like a big sister to these guys, so it was great. The villain could have been better, especially his back story, it was very short and typical of taking over the world type deal. Everyone knows Superman is returning so no spoilers here, when he does return it was Epic! It was the Superman that a lot of people was waiting for, the classic Reeve Superman that has hope. I liked the MOS Superman and BvS, I didn't mind that he was going through tough times on earth and it made him a better Superman. I read the rotten tomatoes reviews and it makes me laugh as you can tell they either Hate Snyder or DC because their points about the movie does not make sense. This was a really good movie, not a great movie, could have been if they would leave more in, but you know what I enjoyed myself and can't wait to watch it again, it was also fun when the crowd gets into. I was in a full theater people were clapping and cheering, so I have no idea what the critics were looking at. I came out smiling and happy, with BvS I came out saying OK, not bad but confused because so much was gong on. I had to watch it again to assure myself that I do like the movie. Justice League I came out and knew right away this movie was good. Can't wait for the Blue Ray to get that extra 45 minutes. Go see this film, who cares what the critics think, they have their own agenda, see it for yourself and you decide and come back here put in a review :)"

","Although poorly paced, Justice League is a thoroughly enjoyable romp of a film. If there's one thing I'm learning from these DC Movies, it's that WB needs to stop interfering and placing restrictions that are damaging these films. It's evident here in the film length, and as a result the pacing, but I'm certain you'll still have fun and be drawn in watching Justice League."

","What a marvelous way to introduce several other DC Superhero characters w/o having made 1-3 individual origin movies for each of them first. Superman only had one (Man of Steel), while Batman Vs. Superman was a messy continuation and reintroduction for Batman (Batman Begins, Dark Knight, and Dark Knight rises were a completely different Batman). Wonder Woman only had one, and it takes place years before the events of Justice League. Flash and Cyborg don't have an origin movie yet, while Aquaman got his well after release of trashy Justice League movie. Warner Brothers was so impatient in trying to rush and compete with Marvel, and this is the result... one of the dumbest movies ever conceived. They should focus in producing 1-3 origin movies for each individual DC Superhero (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, etc...), before finally rebooting for another Justice league movie. Stop competing with Marvel, for they patiently setup their cinematic universe, while Warner Brothers couldn't wait building theirs for at least 5 years."

"jackmay-00204","5","2","14","26 November 2017"," Unfortunate, Forgettable - Zero Effort Production
","Giving this 5 stars ""just because"", but it honestly could be rated far lower. Certainly not a 10 star film by any stretch, so ignore the studio PR social media teams. <br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie for a whole host of reasons; I like all of the characters, I like and respect the original comics and I loved the visuals from the previous films, but this was a lame effort on the part of the writers, directors and really the actors. Watching this film, I was struck by the lack of enthusiasm that all involved seemed to have for the opportunity that they had in its making. None of the actors really seemed to take their roles seriously. The acting, for the most part was atrocious as were the lines that the actors were expected to deliver. The scenes were poorly written and poorly directed and didn't seem to flow coherently. The entire movie is a forgettable mess that just leaves me sad for DCU fans. <br/><br/>Here are just a few things that ruined this film: Hipster, tattooed Aquaman portrayed as a UFC style ""bro-dude"" spouting lines like - ""That's what I'm talking' 'bout!"" and ""..I dig it"". <br/><br/>Whiny, anxiety-riddled Flash constantly complaining throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The Cavill/Gadot sex symbol show. Yes, they are both extremely good looking people but that's not really why I paid to see this movie. Thanks for working Gadot's ass into so many shots, but I really wanted see a movie with a bit more substance. <br/><br/>Product placement from Mercedes that was so obvious it was laughable. <br/><br/>Smuggled-in politics, from the scene depicting the white-power skinhead dude screaming outside of a Moslem owned store while a Moslem child gazes on in fear, to quips about global warming between Bruce Wayne and Aquaman. I get it, all this stuff is bad, but I didn't come to see this film to be preached to. <br/><br/>There was more, but as I stated, the movie was pretty forgettable."
"maindraaritomo","5","2","14","26 November 2017"," That thrill, again?
","I read reviews, asked friends who have seen it, so I come with certain expectation, and ... voila! Another BvS thrill! Again?<br/><br/>Why, I just don't know why. They keep the dark so far, because the super amazing Dark Knight's success? Move on, guys! Checking the foe, for how fun everybody there, so you try to have some too? Come on! Be yourself. You order Flash to be the funny naive cutie character? No way, that is sloppy. We all think, ""oh, they have bla- bla-bla, he is so funny, and so you have Flash?"" I didn't laugh for how jokes or funny scenes were thrown, only few spectators laugh as I recall last night. <br/><br/>Producers don't bring anything new for the idea of bunch of heroes or good guys, one or few of them are funny. You just join the club, just like that, ignoring the noble idea of up to date Superman and Batman, how you all started it. Bet Box office is always the main reason. Yeah right, we know.<br/><br/>BvS has Batman as savior for entire movie, this time no savior at all. Everyone is lost. Perhaps I breathe in quite a relieve on Superman reborn scene. I like it.<br/><br/>Few notes: <br/><br/>1. CGI used has a low quality. Specially imitating faces of actors on action scenes did not go well. We can distinguish which is CGI and which is actors themselves. To be honest, the CGI quality reminds me to Matrix trilogy way back then.<br/><br/>2. Small things are neglected as goofs. Like janitor scene in Star Labs. When Silas left, then drove home, talked to Victor, the janitor stays cleaning the same spot all these times, for hours, until he got kidnapped.<br/><br/>3. Flash's costume designed for dealing the friction with air or everything else while he moves very fast in the speed of lightning. But his daily outfit is okay too, right? Check out when he runs around in Bat Cave, lightning appears, and his jacket, pant and sneaker shoes are still intact after. Just another goof. <br/><br/>4. So Martha left the house because of foreclosure, and leave all Clark's clothes for him to wear it again someday he resurrects? Martha has super ability to see the future I believe.<br/><br/>5. Amy Adams looks older while Cavill does not. This one issue to deal with for next Superman-Lois movies.<br/><br/>Producers, please decide, be dark or be fun, if you want to combine them, think about it like hundred times.<br/><br/>What I feel from BvS and JL (also count in Suicide Squad), like entering fancy restaurant, with well known chef, but they only serve scrambled egg and coffee."

","This movie would have been much better and more entertaining without the preachy, dull, cardboard Batfleck, who apparently forgot how to act when he put on the bulky Bat suit, and became stiffer than a board as soon as he stepped into character. There's only so much social justice angst and guilt and preaching about how we're ruining the environment and I can take.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller as the Flash tried hard for comic relief, but was trapped in a millennial pajama boy character.<br/><br/>Ray Fisher did well as Cyborg. He played it straight - traumatized man, who believes himself a monster, and takes the opportunity to allow others who are different into his heart.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot was resplendent. Her energy lights up the screen, and she's the perfect Wonder Woman.<br/><br/>Henry Cavill finally got over being the annoying, ennui-ridden Superman. He was all Jesus and hope - sunshine and rainbows. I don't think I could have tolerated another moody, conflicted Superman.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa was by far the best thing about this movie: relaxed, fun, intense, and hot all at the same time.<br/><br/>And now they're doing a BATFLECK MOVIE???

The only sympathy i had was for flash, but he was so over the top that it felt fake again. I also liked the scenes with the Valkyires.<br/><br/>The continoutiy is weird in this movie. For Example: Sometimes in a fast scene, there is a cut to a hero, just doing a pose, which takes out all the momentum and it feels offputting to me.<br/><br/>This movies action is typical hollywood, fast cuts from actors to stunt doubles.
Action plays by its own rules. There are only consequences if the plot desires it.<br/><br/>@CGI / VFX for character's and enviroment:
Some Characters look wierd in this movie. Cyborg would have probably looked much better with more practicable effects. Superman's face looks wrong. The enviroment does not feel real or looked realistic. Even the camera positions have been strange.
The batcave alone should be treated with much love and detail, we should be in awe when bruce shares it with the others.<br/><br/>Finally the villian of this movie was a mediocre uninteresting bad guy to beat up at some point, so the movie can end."

"invisibleunicornninja","1","1","5","13 August 2018"," Boring and bland.
","A while ago I got an ad on YouTube. That ad was simply the scene from this movie where they try to rip off the scene from Captain America: Civil War where Iron Man recruits Spider-Man but with Batman and The Flash. The scene was so bad that I then decided that I would go out of my way to watch the full movie in the hopes that the whole thing would be a so-bad-that-its-good movie. Unfortunately, its just boring. <br/><br/>Plot - This movie's story is so bland and uncreative that anything you might imagine being the plot would probably be more interesting than the actual movie. <br/><br/>Characters - I've got nothing against any of these characters on their own or in other versions of them. In this movie they suck. No-one has any depth or is interesting enough to hold any of the scenes in there. There are hints of actual personalities, but not enough for it to actually be entertaining. I was hoping that it would end up being funny, but the dialogue is so bad that its not even ironically entertaining. Its just sad that someone was paid to write this script. If there even was a script. The only person in this movie that was even good was Aquaman. I'm not even a fan of the character. He's just the only person who was entertaining because the guy understood he was in a dumb movie and just didn't care. Its a bit like Hawkeye's dynamic in Avengers: Age of Ultron. He knew he was in dumb, boring movie, but he worked with the minuscule screen time he had. <br/><br/>Villain - The villain isn't even a villain. Its a mass of CGI and some moron screaming into a microphone. I've seen a lot of superhero movies, and this villain is by far the worst. He has no motivation or premise and is even worse than the mess that was Apocalypse in X-Men: Apocalypse - and he was a pretty terrible villain. At least Apocalypse had a motivation. It was dumb and his plan was dumb, but at least I understood what he was about. <br/><br/>Sound Mixing - I'm not one to point out the actual audio quality (I don't hear well enough to pick up slight changes) but the drop in audio quality for certain scenes is noticeable. Multiple different kinds of microphones were used in this movie and I don't see why. Honestly its a bit distracting when all of a sudden Wonder Woman appears onscreen and it sounds like her lines were dubbed over using an iPhone to record the new audio. Also, the soundtrack is played so quietly under the sound effects that I don't get why they put the music in at all. <br/><br/>Visuals - This movie looks like total sh**. The effects suck and the color palette is so bad even I noticed how crappy the colors are. There are brightly colored scenes that are also grainy and the overall visual quality itself is bad. Any scene where they are in a field or forest look bad because of the weird colors and any scene in a populated area looks terrible because of the bad CGI. The effects would be funnier if this movie was less boring. Honestly if this movie had the creativity to go totally off the rails, then it would be way more entertaining than what they went with.<br/><br/>Overall I would not recommend this movie. Its not even worth watching on an ironic level. Its just boring."

It may be because I'm a big Marvel fan or some of the other reviews I've read, but a lot of this movie seems to be a bad knock off of the Marvel films, down to the nervous, hyper youngster of the gang (hint Spiderman). 
Now some remarks that I'm sure some will find sexist 
Diane Lane and Connie Nielsen both look fantastic and Gal Gadot keeps the ""I'm tall and sexy and proud of it"" attitude Linda Carter had. 
I may try this movie a second time but doubt I'll make it to the end."
"XweAponX","10","1","5","5 May 2018"," Giving 10/10 for the ""Ultimate Cut"" Fanedit
","I would give the theatrical more like 8/10, maybe even 7/10, because I did like some of the things in it.<br/><br/>Whedon tries to turn this into a MCU film, which he is good at. But the story that Snyder developed was something a lot different than the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Death of Superman is the quintessential DC Storyline. It's the darkest thing they've ever done. Whedon tries to lighten it up too much, but the scenes which Snyder had shot conflict with that. There certainly is a big difference between Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon. This was a story that deserved to be told by the original director, just for continuity's sake. But the theatrical version fails to tell the continuation of the same story from BvS. The Ultimate Cut Fanedit, however, does.<br/><br/>The only issue with the Fanedit is of course, the fact that it's a fanedit, and you have to go out and look for it, it's not hard to find, but it is difficult to get. And the guy who edited it, messed up the continuity in a few spots. But it does give us a good idea of what would have happened had Snyder been able to finish the work he had started 7 years earlier. It would have finished his Man of Steel trilogy. I'm hoping at some point, Snyder will be able to make his cut of this film, we had to wait almost 25 years for Richard Donner to do his original vision for Superman II. And that was worth it. On that day when Zack Snyder is able to make his version of this, that will also be a great day. I hold out a great hope for this.<br/><br/>An official Snyder Ultimate cut would explain why dreams are not really dreams and why The Flash has to say ""Is it too soon?"". Is The Flash mucking with Time in BvS? <br/><br/>I did not really like Batman v Superman, until I saw the Ultimate Cut. I did not really like Justice League, until I saw all of the missing scenes that explain what's happening. Snyder's concept for Steppenwolf, shown in the BvS ultimate cut, is a lot more menacing. I've seen some Snyder previz footage that has a very frightening image of Steppenwolf. But the Steppenwolf in the film, I don't know who is responsible for it, some have told me this was Snyder's imagery. But it does not fit, so I have always thought it was Whedon's work. <br/><br/>The ""Ultimate Cut"" has a continuation of this ""Dream"", but as if from Cyborg's POV. Something even worse, somebody even worse than Steppenwolf is coming. I hope that when that story is told, it is told as well as Man of Steel and Batman v Superman.<br/><br/>I understand the immense disappointment with this film, it mirrors my sadness that the Filmmaker who created this vision was not able to complete it.<br/><br/>I encourage anyone who wants to see how this film could have gone to search out the Fanedit. It's worth it.<br/><br/>It occurs to me, if Whedon had treated this film more like his ""Serenity"", it might have worked better."

I'm not sure what Snyder was going for, but he missed.<br/><br/>The acting was what you would expect.

"phubbs","4","1","5","14 February 2018"," Justice League
","So this was it, the main event, the big one to rival Marvels 'The Avengers'. Only five movies in and DC (along with Warner Bros.) felt it would be a shrewd decision to whack out their superhero team-up flick, hmmm.<br/><br/>This was always gonna be a hard sell with the performance of previous DC movies. Superman hadn't really set the world alight and the Suicide Squad was a nice idea that was badly executed. Wonder Woman of course did well (boosted by a political agenda) but that now seems like a flute more than anything. We hadn't had any stand alone movies for Flash, Cyborg or Aquaman up to this point, something that just felt totally wrong. So not only was this a sequel of sorts to the previous Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman offerings, it was also a slight origins kick off for Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman (despite previous cameos).<br/><br/>Alas the plot is anything but fresh (its a superhero flick). A long long long long time ago on Earth, the evil supervillain Steppenwolf (stupid name) tried to take over the planet using three gizmos called Mother Boxes. He was beaten back by a whole team of other superhero types and said Boxes were hidden on Earth (if you wanna protect Earth, why not hide them elsewhere? Like in the far flung reaches of the universe). Much later in the present day the Boxes are triggered by the death of Superman? Or the presence of Superman? Are these things sentient beings? I have no friggin' clue but they activate and this gets Steppenwolf's attention. So he comes back to find the Boxes and try to take over the Earth to please his master Darkseid. Why he didn't just do this before I dunno, don't delve too deeply into this plot.<br/><br/>Enter our team of heroes, the Justice League. First up its good old Batman (Ben Affleck), the leader who's super power is being very rich (his own words). Alas this comment really hits home because his presence is really kinda stupid. Why would you need a regular human dressed in bat armour in a fight with super powered aliens and metahumans? He provides them with some cool vehicles...which they don't need, umm...he also lets them kip at his place? Unfortunately Affleck also seemed to not care about this movie seeing as he clearly didn't wanna be there, and he looked tubby. When he takes off his batsuit the shirt he has on underneath also has a muscle structure built into it. Methinks they had to cover his actual physique.<br/><br/>Then we have Supes (Henry Cavill) who is basically the same as before. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) who essentially struts around making smartass comments all the time. Apparently the success of Gadot's only movie has gone to her head because my God does she act smug for the whole time. The Flash (Erza Miller) is the obligatory comic relief which is enjoyable for what its worth but is at odds with the movies tone. Also where did he get that Nasa material to build his suit? Next up is Cyborg (Ray Fisher) who is another character that doesn't really fit here. Like what does this guy do? He's basically an agile Terminator, but it seems like he could be easily destroyed at any point. And lastly there is Aquaman (Jason Momoa), the final pointless character here unless you're fighting underwater. But wait, Aquaman seems to have powers on land in this movie too because plot necessities.<br/><br/>One problem I had with this movie were the effects and general look of everything. Firstly its that same old drab, metallic, dark, shadowy atmosphere that DC (via Zack Snyder) has been pushing this whole time. The movie looks awful, the colour palette is terrible, and it all looks the same. Naturally there is abundance of CGI which is to be expected but again its poor and obvious looking, whilst having that strange DC/WB videogame-esque look to it. Did I mention the greenscreen? Oh my God it was horrendous and so very very obvious. The battle between Steppenwolf's army and the Earth defenders at the start was horribly dated looking. Almost all underwater sequences looked bad plus you couldn't really make much out. Steppenwolf himself looked like a character out of a Mortal Kombat movie. And Cyborg was quite jokey looking at times, he looked like he was made out of tinfoil with a bad face job.<br/><br/>I think the epitome of dross in this movie came when Aquaman surfed on a parademon whilst falling from a great height. He then crashes into a high-rise building, smashes all the way through it from top to bottom, and comes out surfing at the bottom with a grin on his face. This was literally cringeworthy cartoon garbage that also looked shit.<br/><br/>The other main problem here was the entire movie simply being cheap. As in using dated tropes and cliches whilst being just plain stupid. Thing is this was somewhat expected with the characters you're dealing with. Aquaman, he's useless, he merely pops up to do stuff that involves water because he's the water guy. Oh everyone's about to be drowned by a huge tidal wave!! Enter Aquaman...hurray! Oh we need someone to hack into this computer control panel thingy and do some hi-tech computer type stuff? Enter Cyborg because he's the robot guy. Oh we need someone to get somewhere really quickly or rescue some people in the nick of time? Enter Flash because he's the fast guy. Batman turns up to every battle in some yuge mechanical battle vehicle (because otherwise he's useless)...and it gets wrecked instantly. Batman loses a lot of gear in this flick. Wonder Woman strolls out of every battle without even her lipstick being smudged, ugh!<br/><br/>The acting was pretty dreadful across the board (except for Gal Gadot of course, because you can't say anything negative about her now). As said Affleck was clearly uninterested, Fisher swaggered as much as he could but was still awful, Momoa had big muscles and lots of hair, whilst the character of Steppenwolf was basically a live action pantomime. Of course there were numerous other characters throughout offering other actors a crack but its all cameo stuff really. A too many cooks situation basically, heck whilst the big finale battle was going down humanity was represented by one small family, probably because they literally couldn't fit anymore people in.<br/><br/>All in all I really struggled to find anything positive in this movie. The small sequence where the team brings Supes back from the dead was quite enjoyable. It was fun watching Superman knock the team around; I especially liked the eerie moment Supes spies Flash whilst he's zooming in his superhuman speed zone. Although, I'm not really sure why Supes would fight the team after his resurrection. OK he's understandably disorientated but why does he see the others as threats? The opening Batman sequence was also nice and harked back to earlier Batman movies in tone and visuals. Twas also lovely to hear a very short burst of Danny Elfman's Batman 89 score in one scene. It was literally a few seconds but even that was enough to really swell the scene in terms of awesomeness and nostalgia.<br/><br/>That's virtually it! That's pretty much the only bits in the movie that I genuinely liked. The rest of this effort felt very much like (ironically) a Joel Schumacher movie. Yes it is indeed that bad. The entire movie generally looks poor, the effects are very suspect at times (Cyborg), the greenscreen is some of the worst I've seen for some time, and the plot is generic as f*ck. Add to that the even more generic villain Steppenwolf with his hordes of flying goggle wearing goblins, and a finale that was possibly the biggest anticlimax in years (considering the content we're dealing with here). And even now I still can't help but think Superman could of done this all on his own. Why is Batman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg and Aquaman even here?? Flash was probably the only other genuinely useful person. This really felt like bad a movie from the mid 90's. The bottom line, its ugly, dull and unbelievably uninspired.<br/><br/>4/10"

","Ok the bad things first! Amy adams and Henry Cavill's emotionless relationship onscreen dragged the Movie down quite a bit.
superman could stay dead for her it wouldnt have mattered. There was no sense of love or happiness between the two characters at all.
Here's Superman, returned from the dead, and she was like ok.. fine.
Another really disappointing thing is the usual return of a complete CGI
Villain. It's terrible from start to end. Every scene with this bad cmputer animated Steppenwolf looser you just want to fastforward.
To have Villians completely In cgi It makes the impact and the danger of the fightscenes and Everything is on par with the worthless Avenger films.
FIght robots fight demons jadajada.. It looks like they are punching in the Air. Waving like lunatics at nothing. It becomes childish and weird and theres no sense of threat.<br/><br/>The good parts: Let's be honest. I just Watch this film for Wonder Woman.
She's all the starpower a superhero can have in these types of cliche teenage cgi action Movies. Batmans suit looks like a potato, The fishman has some tribal tattoos, and then we have the cgi robot. 
Flash was actually really good! He's character was the one with most depth In this film. When superman try to hit him you sense it in his actions that he's damn worried! One hit he may die. small things like that. 
Not as great as Quicksilver In the xmen Movies but it worked here as well."

","7.2/10 Here it is! The culmination of the DC Universe, that unites the beloved heroes from our childhood in... the shortest DCEU movie to date? And the least profitable one at that? What's supposed to be a grandiose milestone is just a fun, flawed and a bit forgettable movie. The one thing that JL undoubtedly succeeded in selling us the characters. I am now officialy interested in their separate solo movies,albeit their introductions feeling rushed in the midst of the whole behind-the-scenes drama. The editing room of WB probably looks like a particularly booze-fueled bar brawl right now. Good luck cleaning Wan! Speaking of chaotic wreckage, how did this CGI happen to exist? Sure, some of it looks nice, but the villain looks straight out of a PS3 game. Steppenwolf, as they continue on and on repeating his name, is just a cookie cutter threat with a few cool lines. Aliens are invading as many blockbuster scripts as planets nowadays. The pacing in the beginning is a bit frustrating, originating from shifting the focus from character to character. What truly saves this movie is the team interaction. I have always though that Affleck is okay as Batman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman has been the main driving force for DC and the new ""recruits"" are fun. Their witty banter about everyone's own corner of the world is what adds a much needed flair to the movie. You can feel that behind every character, there is the potential for a whole movie franchise to bloom.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Enjoyable,but inelegantly underwhelming, Justice League paves the road for a lighter tone in the future of the DCEU. The characters make the journey worth travelling as their team-play breathes life into the movie. I allow myself to be pessimistically excited for future films in this shared universe. And from now on let only one director handle a project please!"

","This is a non-spoiler review.So, the movie starts off from a post superman era where Batman is in mourning and blames himself for his death. He and WonderWoman recruits meta-humans and other people with abilities like Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg. It's a pretty non-linear plot and ain't complicated with multiple story lines like BvS.<br/><br/>The core of the movie is the actors, everybody has done it perfectly, especially Gal Gadot's Charisma, she just mesmerizes everybody with her presence. Ezra Miller as Flash is just like the comic book character joking around giving a light atmosphere to the movie. Batman's character arc is the most important thing how he changes after superman sacrifices his life for humans and now is a less darker version and doesn't kill criminals or brands them. Aquaman and Cyborg are honourable mentions. Amy Adams has the least role. That was a let down comparing to MoS and BvS.<br/><br/>The background music isn't up to the mark and you won't be humming it after you come out of the theater and Elfman used old themes to give it a vintage effect. Nothing compared to Han Zimmer and Junkie XL .<br/><br/>Cinematography is good, but not as good as Larry Long's in the prequel.<br/><br/>The script has many one-liners, it's a different approach from the dark tone of the DCEU movies. So it's a transitional phase.<br/><br/>The only con will be that there isn't much element of surprise for Fans. And the pace of the movie is too fast, you won't have anything to remember to geek about in this 2hr movie.<br/><br/>The movie has many goosebumps inducing scenes and crowd going bonkers, you will lose your voice shouting and cheering if you watch with fans.<br/><br/>If you want to watch the movie to get entertained, this is the right movie for you. If you expect satisfaction as a Zack Snyder fan, this isn't the movie, you would certainly miss his vision of DCEU. <br/><br/>And regarding 37% Rotten Tomatoes score, it's not the official one, Leading Critic said he never posted his review and Town Tomatoes just took it without his permission. One critic's 2.5 rating was placed in rotten category and it's just pure injustice people targeting Snyder movies.<br/><br/>RANT ABOUT WB AND JOSS WHEDON<br/><br/>This review won't be complete without this rant. Zack Snyder completed 80% of the movie and asked Joss Whedon to complete the movie as he had to deal with a personal tragedy. Approaching Joss Whedon was the first mistake, he included some lame, ridiculous scenes that ruined the characters like Lois Lane and Martha Kent. <br/><br/>Second mistake was WB forcing Zack Snyder to cut 45 mins from the movie, the same happened with BvS and ultimate edition turned out to be a misunderstood masterpiece, it's not right production company inferring with an artist's freedom.<br/><br/>All we can do is wait for the director's cut and watch the movie the way it was intended to. And please stop the negativity based on the biased group of critics called Rotten Tomatoes. Just watch the movie and decide for yourself."

","OK, maybe contains spoiler. We'll see. I didn't come to this movie to get strung along like a crack addict like the MCU films. I wanted to see how the different character arches would resolve themselves and I wasn't disappointed. The characters had more gravitas and actual grief to deal with than MCU's which seemed to find a way to make one annoying wise crack after another.<br/><br/>I'm also glad that the actors kept their pie holes shut about things besides the movie leading up to the premiere. They let the movie do the talking.<br/><br/>Putting the idiotic politics of the day aside, Affleck's world weary depiction of Batman was good and sympathetic. Gal Gadot added warmth and maturity. The other depictions had sufficient back story to understand what was going on. I wasn't expecting deep character development because hey IT'S A COMIC BOOK MOVIE. They had more depth than I anticipated.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the ending. It was good, sufficient and I didn't feel like the story was deliberately left incomplete. <br/><br/>I think the so called bad reviews on this were written by people who just wanted more ""Marvel smartassedness"". The ""mustache issue"" is a non issue. Go see this movie. Great job guys!"

But,,when you try to outdo yourself the sillier you get. The movie isn't silly..it's a great movie for the big screen..it's just when the story tries to outdo the characters it never really works.<br/><br/>Take Wonderwoman for instance..brilliantly put together as a one off story..perfectly directed with just enough of everything and never had to outdo anything..you could quite easily take this from the DC world and it would still work for both.<br/><br/>The extra heroes never had time to gel and we didn't know much about them. Perhaps they should have had their origin movies before this??<br/><br/>Let down by a terrible bad guy and some very dodgy efx..but I still liked it.<br/><br/>Now comes the spoiler ...so beware..the way they brought supes alive was a bit daft..if that was all it took then why didn't they just plug him into the national grid??

","Full-disclosure: I'm a Superman fan. That said, I also like a good film with a good story. To further explain, I liked Dawn of Justice. It had issues, don't get me wrong. But, I still found it enjoyable. The problems I had with the movie were not the same problems the ""critics"" had. To me, most of the ""critics"" issues in both Dawn of Justice and Justice League are trivial and even unjust. <br/><br/>Good: Superman ended up being the Superman we all know, love, and deserve to see on the big screen. Humanity realizes after his death just how much they need him, and the hope that he gave them. Batman, Wonderwoman, Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman played their parts well. And, their roles were relevant to the story. Barry Allen (Flash) was the fitting comic relief. (I Barry wasn't really comical in the comics, it was Wally. But, I still liked it. We've had enough brooding already.) If you follow the comics (or cartoons) even a little, you will see Steppenwolf ended up being written in a way that accurately portrays him as the head of minions (nothing more.) His main goal is to ""ascend"" to a higher level by conquering humanity. <br/><br/>Bad: The villain could have used more explanation. I think some of the confusion around Steppenwolf's character would have been resolved by at least revealing in more detail the hierarchy. But, it didn't impact the story for me."

It's not a terrible movie as most have rated it. It's trying so hard for you to like them. So in that effort, it is a fine movie. Why did I rate this an 8/10? Because it is pure entertainment. Marvel is hellbent on spreading socialism and BLM agenda. Oh, I meant...authoritarian agenda. Disney is behind this. They are garbage people (child molesters and sexual assaulters) who have shielded these monsters for decades. Though they inject moral outrage into their films. Get bent. There is no message in Warner Bros./DC universe. And yet it suffers from (big surprise) poor critical reviews. Lap it up children.<br/><br/>It seems this franchise chooses to treat movie goers as adults and not as spoon fed Leftist toddlers. Yeah, Ben Affleck was accused, but there isn't a morality tale in ""Justice League"" that would parallel the world they want under socialist regime.

","JL is unapologetic in its approach. It's fun, it's action-packed and at times, funny when you least expect it, which is the best kind of funny. It's better than any other DCEU movies that have come before, not only that it seems be treading on new ground than the other DCEU films. But that's a good compliment, saying that it was just better than its predecessors. In fact, it's an understatement. It's unlike the previous movies in every way expect in its flaws which we, the audience, has grown to tolerate in this kind of movies. It's unabashed in its intention to serve to our liking. Perhaps, for this reason, the critics are barring the movie, for not taking an original and creative stance. <br/><br/>Batman, as he always did since The Dark Knight trilogy, shined in portrayal, although, at the middle of the film, there are some traces of the infamous 'BvS decision making' still left in him. As the film progresses to the end, he redeems himself and we see this progression, his progression, to the decisions he makes later in the end; we see the emotional detection, if one would call it that. The princess, Wonder Woman was her usual best self. There was a little insinuation of romance from Batman (from Alfred, to be accurate), but that was not reflected back from Wonder Woman. The new kids on the block are well constructed too. Maybe there was enough character development, but why should one care for such pristine things like proper character development in a superhero movie. Also, how does one get around to do proper character development for people aren't human, or entirely human. There is no reference point, there is no relatability, to begin with.<br/><br/>And action, as good as it was, in the moments of glory, was also a tad over the top at times. The Mysceria (I never could spell it or pronounce it.) fight scene was mesmerizing in execution. The 'change in costumes' of the Amazonians was exactly exploitation of women's sexuality because we barely see it. The Amazonians are always on the move and one will be occupied with what they will proceed to do, to properly notice the shortened costumes.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw of the movie is how easy the protagonists have it. The answers, all of them, come at so fast a pace that the film seems to be zooming to the end, and to say that the villain was weak is not only a character assessment but also a literal one. The villain, who is all so powerful throughout the film is defeated in a matter of minutes. The evil plan is the same too, the destruction of this planet or that.<br/><br/>The music was underwhelming as in its effects on the audience is ephemeral. It's good for the moment, but not as good upon revisits.<br/><br/>It is fun is the final verdict. See it if you want to have fun."

","Review: Justice League is a pretty good movie. It's not bad or great, and while there were a lot of hiccups leading up to the release, including $25MM in reshoots, a change of directors and writers, and a time crunch to get the CGI done before the film's November 17th release date, I'd say it's a movie worth seeing. It definitely doesn't have the feel of when Marvel brought The Avengers together for the first time on the big screen, but it is a step-up from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad. <br/><br/>Let's start with the pros. The characters. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) steals the show (as she did this summer in her solo movie debut), The Flash (Ezra Miller) is the comedic hooligan of the group, Aquaman (Jason Momoa) is the BAMF and King of the Ocean, and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) is the brains. While the character development for 3 new characters is tough to achieve when making a 2 hour film, I think that the movie does a good job in regards to providing enough back story on each character to give a sense of clarity for the viewer. Another pro is the lighter tone of the movie compared to Batman v Superman. You can clearly see where Joss Whedon picked up after Zack Snyder stepped down. Whedon is a mastermind and it was great to see his comedic take on film come to life in Justice League. <br/><br/>And now the cons. The movie's plot is just like any other superhero team up film. Villain comes to Earth and needs to collect the ""doomsday"" machine. Villain collects said machine. Villain inevitably loses to the superhero group after the group goes through a loss/devastating blow. It is predictable and we've seen in many times over (The Avengers, Batman v Superman, The Avengers: Age of Ultron, Suicide Squad). Besides the predictable plot, it's upsetting to see a movie with a ~$300MM budget butcher the CGI. You can clearly tell where they fell short due to the Joss Whedon reshoots, and while it could've been better, it just wasn't up-to-par like most Marvel movies. For anyone who is a fan of DC, there are plenty of Easter eggs that set up future films.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's a pretty good movie that's worth the watch if you're a fan of the genre."
"morras","7","1","5","17 November 2017"," Not bad. But should have been better.
","Batman very good once again. WW too. Although I'd prefer to see the traditional versions of heroes, I liked the changed Aquaman, with a more powerful and with a badass looks and attitude. There was not much development of the character, but we all know him and he is goingo to have his own solo movie, so thats not a major problem. IMHO, Cyborg was not a choice that made sense for a JLA origin movie. He is originally a Teen Titans character. They managed to make some good sense for his being there, though. As for the Flash, he is just too differente from the character I grew up with as a DC fan. Too young and clumsy and clearly effeminate. Not that there's anything wrong with a gay character, just with the turning of Barry Allen into one.<br/><br/>So overall it was a fun experience. But not yet the DC movie that does justice to JL."

","Its utterly a cinematic disaster. From the cheesy acting. To the bad script heck even the so called ""heros"" are very heroic in this movie. (And its about them) the CGI is not only bad but embarrassingly bad for the time we are in and the budget the movie had. Before the DCEU movies were pretty bad, but they still had their own tone to it (being dark etc) however now its a bad rip of off marvel."
"vivianwu-32929","5","1","6","16 December 2018"," A product of tragic circumstance
","It seems that Superheroes these days like to travel in packs, from Avengers to X-men to Guardians, and now, Justice League. As a recent fan of the DC universe, after watching Wonder Women, I was thrilled by the release of this movie. The cast was especially promising. The stunning Gal Gadot (!!!) returns as Wonder Woman, Batman is portrayed by Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill as Superman. Aquaman (Jason Momoa), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and Flash (Ezra Miller) are introduced. Together, they would form the Justice League.<br/><br/>The movie continues the story from where Batman vs. Superman (2016) left off. Superman is dead, and the world is in danger. Batman, driven by remorse over the death of Superman, attempt to bring a team together to face the incoming catastrophic threat. With the exception of the Flash and Wonder Woman, other would be justice leaguers tries to avoid the incoming fight. Until the threat becomes too big for them to ignore. They would have to work together as ""you can't save the world alone.""<br/><br/>After the movie, I was disappointed. Unfortunately, this movie wasted its resources and became a mess despite its 300 million budget and their amazing cast. Although this result probably is a reflection of a tragic circumstance. The film's director, Zack Synder, stepped away from the project earlier this year after his daughter's suicide. And Joss Whedon, the avenger's director for Marvel, stepped in for finalizing. Their styles are largely different. Synder tends to be dark and stark, while Whedon has humor coming out both visually and emotionally.<br/><br/>When Whedon was stitching together Synder's footages, he added reshoots of his own with extra comedy. While his humor worked seamlessly in The Avengers, somehow it just didn't fit in Justice League. It feels fractured with scenes flying around without structure. Justice League has great potential, but now it just feels like a film with too many hands pulling in different directions. Is it a Zack Synder movie, or a Joss Whedon movie?<br/><br/>The filmmakers made a heroic effort against heavy odds. Justice League does have its thrilling moments that are worth a watch. Especially if you are a DC fan."

"TheMovieDoctorful","2","1","6","9 November 2018"," The Superhero Movie Killer
","I am not a DCEU hater. On the contrary, I have enjoyed each film in the DCEU more than the last. I liked Man of Steel, I loved Batman v. Superman, I loved Suicide Squad several times more and I consider Wonder Woman the best live action comic book film since Spider-Man 2...But boy, do I hate Justice League. I've hated it ever since I first saw it and it gets worse and worse the more I actually think about it. It's to the point where I'm starting to believe that Justice League may very well be the spark that brings out the downfall of the entire superhero movie genre. It's that terrible.<br/><br/>There are small things to enjoy here and there, but nothing that would constitute giving Justice League a positive review. Ezra Miller is perfect casting as The Flash. He's an adorable, hilarious and endearing avatar for the fans and the film gets considerably more enjoyable when we get to appreciate this universe through his wide, brown, doe eyes. Miller definitely has a real screen presence and completely steals the show acting wise. Ray Fisher's Cyborg may as well be a completely different character from the fun loving, light hearted character of the comics, but Fisher does a very convincing job in the role and does give the character some genuine emotional depth that the rest of the League sorely lacks. He has excellent chemistry with Gadot's Wonder Woman (Who is also mostly good here) and it's refreshing to see a friendly, chemistry rich male/female relationship in a comic book movie with no romantic connotations. While the characterization for Momoa's Aquaman is completely non-existent, Momoa at least has some charisma and charm in his nothing role, more than enough to justify his casting.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck...What happened? I genuinely love him as an actor, I found him great in both Batman v. Superman and Daredevil, but he is terrible here. There is absolutely no energy or life to his performance at all. His two emotions in this film are bored and toxically masculine smartass. I'm amazed that he could go from the best Batman to date to nearly reaching Clooney levels of poor. This is very clearly do to a writing and directing standpoint, which go out of their way to make Batman a joking and lighthearted character when that just isn't who he's supposed to be. We can thank Whedon for that.<br/><br/>Henry Cavill is similarly awful in this movie, despite impressive performances in both Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman. His forced attempts at anger and hostility that come right out of nowhere (In an extremely bizarre and seemingly out-of-left left field homage to Pet Sematary) and that awful CGI lip doesn't make his sneers any more intimidating. Later on, when the film needs him to be jokey and optimistic, the turn feels far too abrupt and sudden and Cavill's performance may as well be anti-charisma.<br/><br/>With Justice League and Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance to his name, Ciaran Hands is slowly making a name for himself as the guy you get when you want an uninteresting and phoned in villain. Justice League somehow manages to ripoff Loki from The Avengers and make him even less interesting. As much as I disliked Loki, Tom Hiddleston at least gave a fair amount of screen presence, character and personality to the role. Ciaran Hands' Steppenwolf is a big, grey, CGI horned bad guy who wants to destroy the world for barely discussed reasons who delivers nearly every line in the exact same growly, pissed off attitude. Everything from his design to his strategy to his performance is lazy, uninventive and boring. Why would Justice League choose a villain this unknown if they weren't going to do anything with him?<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailer for Justice League, you already know everything that happens in it. Batman assembles the Justice League. Steppenwolf wants to collect mother boxes to destroy the Earth. The Justice League fights Steppenwolf. That's it. Nothing else. I find it both sad and laughable that the film went so far out of its way to never show us Superman in any of the marketing of the film when his return is about as unmemorable, unsignificant and emotionally unearned as possible. The film never gets going and never picks up anything resembling a pulse. It's like a bloated fish corpse floating above water for 2 hours.<br/><br/>This film has the same problems as The Avengers where instead of our favorite heroes actually bonding with one another or liking each other, Whedon thinks it's far more interesting to have most of them bicker and fight like 12 year olds for the entirety. This time, most of the belligerence at least comes from only one character; Batman. Good God, what have you done, Whedon? The intelligent, intimidating and wise character of the comics is now a whiny, insensitive, immature bully who seemingly starts fights just because he can. I should probably mention that Cyborg is the only character in the film who is remotely developed in any way. Flash very easily could have been with his relationship towards his imprisoned father, but it's practically never brought up again after his introductory scene.<br/><br/>Justice League is an absolute trainwreck. It's a catastrophic blow to both DC and superhero films in general and its noxious, formulaic awfulness will have a lasting effect on both for years. If The Avengers hurt comic book movies as a whole, Justice League (Bar from a few exceptions) may have very well killed them."

"paul-2148","2","1","6","11 August 2018"," Superhero movie without any heroes.
","It has evolved to the point where these movies are like candy bars, and every year they put the same crap candy bar in a new wrapper. Candy tastes good but it has no nutrional value and is bad bad for us. These movies are soulless. There is no humanity in them. If you look at the best action movies - the Bourne trilogy and any Jason Stratham film - we are invested in the humanity of the leads. The fight scenes are thrilling because we care about the characters outcomes. The fight scenes in all of these comic book movies, even in Black Panther, are indistinguishable. There's so much 3D and special effects it looks plastic. Justice League is the worst of the lot. 3D characters interact with green screen characters. There are explosions and fire, superhero's and villains thrown into walls. Walls collapsing. Buildings collapsing. Light streaks. Lens flares. Sparks falling from ceilings. Yet, as a viewer, these are great times to go make a sandwich. I find myself wishing that all of these characters would die off in a fiery explosion. <br/><br/>Another key point is that these films reek of fear. The fear is that none of these characters can carry a film by themselves - you have groups of these gayly dressed men and the occasional woman all fighting a villain that really no one cares about. John Wayne hated High Noon because the protagonist was a coward. He was a coward who couldn't stand up and fight by himself without the help of the villagers to support him in his own weakness. Wayne and many other famous directors thought that a film hero, especially a western hero, is obligated to overcome his own weaknesses and fight alone against the forces of injustice and evil. The reason for this is that men must face their own problems and injustices in their own lives alone. If you are underpaid and you feel it necessary to confront your own boss for a higher wage you don't bring your wife, your buddies, or your dad into the office to make the case for you. You do it alone. <br/><br/>
I watched The Apartment, the great Billy Wilder film last night. Jack Lemmon is a superhero in that film and he doesn't throw a single punch. He fights for true love and magnomity. He fights the corporate machine. He Fights peer pressure. In the end however his fight is with himself. He has to come clean with who he is, and he does it mostly by deciding who he is not. He's not a playboy or a ladies man though there is tremoundous cultural pressure to be so. He is not a corporate climber though that ethic was instilled into him. He falls in love with a girl who loves someone else. That someone else is a man of power who he fears but doesn't respect. In his fight he loses his job, his true love and his apartment. Yet he gains his self respect. He becomes a ""true man"" not what culture has decided a man is. Of course being a true code hero, he does get the girl in the end. He does this by transforming her as well. She sees the hero in him which opens her eyes to her own shortcomings and bad decisions. That is what a hero does. <br/><br/>There is nothing transformative about these comic book films. Maybe there was in the begging of all this. There are not any character arcs or growth. I propose that you are not even entertained by these films. <br/><br/>So to me these superhero movies all lack one thing.
A hero."

"milleniumlogan","7","1","6","19 January 2018"," One of the most underrated films ever!
","As is evident from my rating I loved this movie! Before I get into what I liked about it, I would like to address some of the common critiques circulating about this movie.<br/><br/>A common criticism of the movie is that, ""Superman's face CGI is so bad."" For those who don't know, this comes as a result of the fact that Henry Cavill had a contract with the studio of MI-6 saying that he must keep facial hair until that movie is done filming. Obviously, superman does not have a beard so Warner Bros. solution to the problem was to use graphics to make superman's face clean-shaven. I can honestly say that I don't find it to be that noticeable. Sure, if you take a screenshot of a scene and stare at it for long enough you can notice some distortion but during the movie it really isn't all that noticeable. I think a large part of the criticism here is coming from the fact that everyone knew about the facial hair dilemma so everyone went into theaters just waiting to see his face. If you don't have a problem with the Grand Moff Tarkin in Rogue One, you should not have a problem with superman's face either. Especially since the Tarkin was barely distinguishable from characters in Call of Duty.<br/><br/>Another criticism of the movie is that, ""The villain is so terrible!"" Let me just say that if you go into a superhero movie expecting a villain as complex as, let's say King Edward Longshanks in Braveheart, you are going to be disappointed! Steppenwolf does what a villain in a team-up superhero movie needs to do. He has a feasible plan to destroy the world -unlike Ultron in Avengers: Age of Ultron , he's got an army, some motherboxes to find, and to top it off he's a badass. If you need more than that from a superhero villain, it is probably a good idea to avoid the genre of superhero movies altogether.<br/><br/>Now I'll get into what I liked about the movie:<br/><br/>1. I liked every character in the movie. Ben Affleck does a great job portraying an aging and at times somewhat humorous batman. Plus, his batmobile is even cooler in Justice League than it was in B v S. I will be very disappointed, if he does not continue as the batman because he is by far the best batman. Batfleck forever! Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman also adds to the movie in that she avoids falling into the typical mean, brassy category of female heroes that often tend to annoy me and instead portrays a more compassionate character. Jason Momoa is great as a trident-wielding and often gruff hero. Henry Cavill's Superman is much more fun to watch in this entry in the DCEU than he was previously. Ezra Miller adds a well-timed humor into the mix and the Cyborg is necessary to the plot.<br/><br/>2. The chemistry between the characters was awesome! They all played off each other exceptionally well. One of my biggest complaints with the first Avengers was the constant bickering between Captain America and Iron Man. Arguing is not entertaining. If it was I'd pull up a chair every time I saw friends or family having heated discussions. In Justice League, there was only one true argument and it didn't last long. <br/><br/>3. The action sequences were great. The trailer teased some awesome action and the movie did not let me down. All the characters individual strengths were used to their full potential to create some of my favorite action sequences in any movie to date. The first time I watched the movie, I found myself grinning from ear to ear.<br/><br/>4. The length actually ending up being perfect. Like many, I was worried when I saw a runtime of only 2 hours but in the end this runtime ended up being a major plus. 2 hours ended up being just enough time to build a story without getting bogged down by unnecessary drama.<br/><br/>I saw this movie three times before it left theater and I will definitely be buying it when it comes out to Blu Ray. As a final note, don't listen to the critics like Rotten Tomatoes. They are just people who have likely gotten a degree in film and as a result feel that they can dictate what movies are good and what movies are garbage. I really hope that bad reviews and mediocre box office results don't hamper the future of the DCEU. There needs to be a Justice League 2!"

","In some ways I've been waiting for this movie my whole life. Now that I've finally seen the film, after sleeping on it these are my thoughts;<br/><br/>The Good: <br/><br/><ul><li>I was taken off guard by the amount of fun I had with Justice League. For almost the entire run time the movie put a big smile across my face, and after it finished I was buzzing. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Focuses completely on its characters, every member of the League shines. There are so many great interactions between them and holy crap superhero moments. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Fixes what I didn't like about Batman in BvS and also presents (potential spoiler) the best interpretation of Superman I've seen in years. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Really does a great job of presenting a world that has lost hope, a world that needs something to look up to and be inspired by. It is up to the Justice League to fill this void,and the movie makes them all feel like HEROES. This part of the film really resonated with me. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Great action sequences that capture what you love about each of these heroes. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Plenty of laugh out loud moments. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Surprisingly touching at times. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I loved hearing bits and pieces of those classic superhero themes come back at some of the best points in the movie. Gave me chills every time. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Doesn't get carried away with setting up future movies or introducing a dozen different plot elements. Justice League doubles down on its characters and lets you spend plenty of time with them. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Loads of cool little Easter eggs that don't bog down the film. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Both post credits sequences that get you excited for what is to come.</li></ul><br/><br/>The Bad: <br/><br/><ul><li>While I think that JL being more straight forward is a good thing, the actual plot here is incredibly shallow. If you're coming to this looking for a great story, you'll have to look elsewhere. For the most part the plot is as generic as comic book films get. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Hands down one of, if not the worst villain I've ever seen in any film. He has no character at all and is only there as a threat and something for the JL to fight. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Extremely heavy on cgi, and not all of it is great, which can be quite distracting. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The film moves fast which unfortunately leads to some important plot elements being glossed over very quickly. As a fan, it's easy to keep up with what's going on. For the regular audience member, the film doesn't always explain itself very well and one could easily find themselves wondering what the heck is even happening. It's fairly all over the place. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The switch in tone after BvS is quite jarring. Although many will see this as a good thing. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The movie lacks a director's touch. It doesn't feel like a Zack Snyder movie, and I wouldn't say it feels a Joss Whedon movie either. Justice League feels very manufactured, with the pieces carefully put together in response to the negative reception of BvS in order to craft a movie that will appeal to the widest possible audience. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If it weren't for the fact that I finally got to see these characters I love on the big screen for the first time represented so beautifully, this would be an entirely forgettable and throwaway comic book movie. Justice League doesn't take any risks. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A couple of head scratching moments and places where the story needed to be tightened up.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall: I loved this film. It has multiple issues but ultimately they didn't hinder my enjoyment. I think how much people like Justice League will be up to each individual. People will want different things out of this film, and I can easily understand why someone would hate it as well as why someone would love it. As a film, it's not great, but as a fan, it gave me so many things that I wanted to see."

"pandya-kaustubh","8","1","6","20 November 2017"," I liked it, but I won't say I loved it only because WB messed it up by hiring Joss Whedon and Danny Elfman
","(MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!) I was looking forward to Justice League since the day Man of Steel (MoS) was announced. Zack Snyder did the unthinkable with MoS. He made a movie that was beautiful on so many levels. Though there were haters, but for those who really understood the movie loved every aspect of it. Zack Synder is an remarkable film maker and dares to do things that most people of afraid of. He knows his stuff, he knows his comics, he knows his lore.<br/><br/>He showed us the journey of an alien sent to an unknown world, who was taught to be human by his parents and who is doubtful of the gifts he has and how he can use them to save the world. This was further explored by Batman Vs. Superman – Dawn of Justice (BvS) where he was perceived as a threat by so many, but still gave up his life for saving those very doubters. BvS also gave us The Batman that we all yearned for a very long time. His initial doubts about Superman showed his experience of how people with power can be. The 'Martha' moment, I believe is the most misunderstood scene by people. The moments of how Superman made a believer out of Batman – these things are what good story telling is all about and Zack Snyder excelled at those. (Hate me for that haters. You don't mean anything). His vision was beautiful which was enhanced by the epic background score of Hans Zimmer (HZ) and Junkie XL (Tom Holkenborg) (JXL).<br/><br/>Coming down to final part of the Zack Snyder's Trilogy – Justice League, the studio after Snyder's exit dumbed down the movie in a move for trying to please the critics but rather ended up changing the whole theme continuity that started with MoS and BvS. I loved both of those movies and was looking forward to this one. <br/><br/>Though I liked the movie, I won't essentially say that I loved it for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. Unnecessary editing for shortening the run-time. A tonne of story developing scenes were lost because of this decision. Though Joss Whedon is a good film maker, he should not have changed the tone of the movie and continued with Zack Snyder's vision, his style and his version of the movie. He should have helped - not change.<br/><br/>2. The tone changing actually felt drastic in compared to MoS and BvS. In trying to please the critics they unnecessarily added some of the ""funny"" moments. The one liner sequences shown in the trailers were already in tune with the comic and the animated movies.<br/><br/>3. Due to the editing some of the story arcs specially for The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman got left out that would have later helped when their solo movies are out.<br/><br/>4. Also, after the resurrection of Superman, his turmoil of coming back from being dead, the question to himself - why he has to get back to saving the world. These are some of the scenes that are parallel / referential to MoS when he goes to the church to find answers and to BvS where Wonder Woman who left the mantel of being a savior 100 years ago comes back to help Batman and Superman when they are faced with Doomsday. When thinking of this and understanding his story telling style, I am sure Zack Snyder would have shot these scenes for further depth to the movie. Superman's appearance in the final version felt more just to show the Trinity as founding members of Justice League.<br/><br/>5. This has to be the most stupid decisions I feel WB took, and that was to hire Danny Elfman. He was nowhere near to what Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL had accomplished with MoS and BvS. He single-handedly ruined it. First by being and egotistical a** by stating that his version of The Batman was the true Batman theme. Secondly, not incorporating Wonder Woman's and Superman's themes made by HZ and JXL. Rupert Gregson-Williams did a good job in Wonder Woman. I wonder why the studio didn't hire him in the first place after JXL quit.<br/><br/>WB should release the extended version or rather should title it as Justice League - the original Zack Snyder's vision along with JXL's background score.<br/><br/>The score of 8/10 is for Zack Snyder's vision."

","After dealing with months of speculation about how good or even great the potential of this film could have been, I am glad we have finally arrived at the moment I had predicted. This movie is OK, but no Avengers. The film seems like a bunch of scenes filmed separately and then put together to resemble a movie. The plot is weak and the villain is a CGI mess. Once again they gave Henry Cavill very little to do or say in this movie as well. Three movies into playing Superman and he has a total of about 60 lines. The good things I can say about the movie is that the individual characters were pretty decent. (However Ben's Batman leaves something to be desired. It seems he was just there to get a paycheck. Glad he is leaving the role.) There is a good fight sequence with the Amazons, and Ezra Millers Flash was entertaining. Do yourself a favor if you are reading this review and have not seen the movie yet, DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE for this film."

","A non-spoilery review of Justice League. Keep in mind I really liked MoS, LOVED BvS, and thought WW was amazing. Suicide Squad was a mistake and so does not exist.<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10: Fun movie that you should see, but probably not in the theater.<br/><br/><ul><li>Hero characters: 9/10: Liked them all and am interested to see their standalone movies, except for the Flash since I feel like I already know that story too well. Aquaman's casting pretty much won me over. Looking forward to seeing them all developed further.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Villain(s): 5/10: Kind of boring bad guy. Felt like they just need someone to bring the League together. Lack of explanation about the New Gods and Apocalypse (almost certainly on purpose) might be frustrating to some, though.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Story: 6/10: Served its purpose, but I was never really surprised by much. Like in WW, humor was mostly character-driven rather than joke-driven. Not the oppressive tone in BvS or MoS. Movie was thus more ""fun"" but it lost some of the mood of impending doom. However, it was far from the stakes-destroying, joke-a-minute fest that most Marvel movies are. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>(Non-action) Cinematography 8/10: It really shined in the quieter moments, especially at the beginning where it was actually a bit chilling. Once the team got together, though, it it wasn't very interesting.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Action: 6/10: They all had a great moment or two (especially one Batman scene and another scene I won't spoil). However, it was inferior to BvS (prior to the final BvS fight, anyway). Cinematography could have been better since much felt kind of by- the-numbers towards the end. Enjoyable, but also hard to take seriously because of...</li></ul><br/><br/>Special effects: 3/10: The special effects were often simply bad. After the great effects of BvS, MoS, and WW, these effects were actually a major downgrade. In fact, I was constantly pulled out of the action by extremely obvious CGI. Do not expect Star Wars or GotG level special effects (and even GotG had some issues with green screens being obvious). The CGI'd villain looked video game quality. Obvious CGI faces, landscapes, backgrounds, and even occasionally heroes. The Flash's lightning effects looked not much better than the TV show. I often felt like I was watching a good-looking animated movie, not a live-action movie. I did not feel like this so much with the other DC movies. It relied far too heavily on CGI landscapes in particular. I get that much of BvS (such as the main fight on the rooftop) used CGI backgrounds, but they didn't look like CGI backgrounds, and I wouldn't have guessed it except for seeing behind the scenes footage. Can't say that for Justice League. Somehow Wonder Woman often looked fake during her fights (though she was great otherwise). Warner Brothers should be embarrassed. Acceptable for maybe 2010, but not for a AAA movie in 2017 when they're competing against Marvel and Star Wars. Sometimes the effects were very good, but this almost made it worse when they became super obvious and undetailed.<br/><br/>See it in theater?<br/><br/>I don't regret seeing it in theater because I wouldn't have wanted to wait until DVD, and other than the special effects, I got pretty much what I expected, but sadly not what I hoped. It was a fun movie and a nice way to spend a couple hours. <br/><br/>I recommend NOT seeing it in theater, though, because the special effects will look less jarring on a small screen. And unless you absolutely don't see the major ""twist"" coming for some reason, you're unlikely to face real spoilers."
"scott-jewels","7","1","6","17 November 2017"," SO MUCH BETTER than expected
","Full, Non-spoiler Justice League review:<br/><br/>NOT the train-wreck I was expecting. In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit. Went in with EXTREMELY low expectations and I left with a smile on my face. It was the only DC movie other than Wonder Woman to have that effect on me... and let me be straight here: it was NO Wonder Woman. There is a distinct difference between the drab Snyder-verse and the lighter toned Joss Whedon-style, but thankfully it's not jarring since both Directors worked on the project.<br/><br/>What worked: Characters. The heroes were very well played. They do feel thrown together, and origin stories are just mentioned but not explored. Wonder Woman was fantastic as usual. Batman was not a miserable SOB, and was actually fun... it made me want to see more Batfleck. Flash was funny (still #NotMyFlash). Cyborg worked better than I thought he would. Superman was FAR MORE Superman-like than ever before in this universe (still no Christopher Reeve). Aquaman was fun and I hope they get to explore him more in the future. Parademons were pretty cool... BOOM Tubes were rad. Good nods to a wider DCU.<br/><br/>What didn't work: Character specific CGI was TERRIBLE. Steppenwolf looked bad. And for the longest time I stared at Supes thinking ""what's wrong with his face?"" when I remembered Joss Whedon re-shot Superman scenes and had to digitally remove a beard. The movie was not as ""EPIC"" as it could have been... but I think after the 3-hour movies we've been presented with, this was a much needed respite.<br/><br/>There are 2 post-credits scenes: one is pretty fast into the end credits and is a lot of fun. Then one is at the very end and is VERY cool, even though it has someone I cannot stand in it.<br/><br/>This movie is FAR more family friendly than the other DC movies to date as it should be. If you were going to compare universes:<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is to Winter Soldier what Justice League is to Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."

","Im an old school DC Comics fan, in all mediums, and couldn't understand how Warner Brothers and DC where handling their properties in the Big Screen post Nolan, so I came to Justice League expecting another Snyder Dark, colorless, humorless, Depressing Crap Fest, and to my surprise had a really great time watching the movie, and this is coming from someone who LOATHED MoS, BvS and SS!Obviously the movie has problems, but it does entertain and present TRUE interpretations of the characters we love."
"dreaslj","7","1","6","17 November 2017"," Very Entertaining, however the stench of Whedon followed me home.....
","I attended the midnight showing last night and although we all had high hopes of this being something special, we left the screen feeling confused (stay until the very end credits and you will see why, it explains nothing). <br/><br/>The film had started well and I very much enjoyed the chemistry between the members of the team to which i felt was the best feature of the film, i think Joss had taken his notes from Avengers and showed these to Snyder. <br/><br/>Affleck looked very uncomfortable portraying batman (After 1 and a half appearances) and quite exhausted trying to carry the team, i have read other reviews and i agree that he lacked charisma but he's still one my favourite actors to play batman (maybe my favourite). One of the problems with this film is that if you saw Wonder Woman, you may consider this a step down when you compare it to the dialogue and action sequences. <br/><br/>Every member of the team had their own uniqueness to them and it did add to their chemistry but i just couldn't help think this is just a rip off from 2012's Avengers. If you watch this from start to finish you may even see similarities in scene sequences (starting with introducing the villain to recruiting the team and then the finishing fight scene) if not a direct mirror of the avengers film. I Personally felt Warner Bros panicked and brought in Whedon to write something in the hopes of bettering his original creation, it's down to public opinion if he failed or not.<br/><br/>I had also hoped that additional characters such as Gordon, Alfred and especially Mera (portrayed by the awesome eye candy that is Amber Heard) had got more screen time, i was quite let down at that but i guess it was due to the festering rush to get this film complete. <br/><br/>The main issue with DC is that they rushed this whole franchise, there was literally no room for character development, only WW was the exception due to the individual film (you can count BvS also), does anyone not wonder why 2 DC films were released 6 months apart from each-other? it just screams ""lets try and catch up with marvel 10 years in the making"". <br/><br/>Regardless, I still felt this film was entertaining and it's action sequences were above average, Steppenwolf as a villain was a let down, i am not going to give anything away but the word ""Ultron"" comes to mind (again, thanks Joss). At no point was i quaking in my boots thinking the world would end, there was no sense of panic at all. It was a desperate plea to bring in bigger and badder villains who aren't worth the ink they're printed on. <br/><br/>Overall, if you're looking for a superhero film which is action fuelled and enjoyable, this is up there on the list with the likes of Avengers, Civil War and Deadpool. However if you watch this as a die- hard DC comics fan, you may be 50/50 on this, maybe even disappointed but it depends on what you expect and what you want from these films nowadays. It still doesn't take away from the fact that this will be a box office hit, but be warned, when leaving the screen, you may find yourself feeling confused in terms of where this franchise is going in terms of direction. Even though I liked the film, I have never had one play on my mind as to what they are trying to do here."

","Not in a good way though. It's completely rubbish. But it's still entertaining. Not because it's good. But because it's relentlessly, perfectly stupid. It all plays like a Saturday morning cartoon. And even though it's a total mess, it's de-Snydered enough to not be as much of a dark, dull dirge as Batman V Superman. It makes The Avengers look like The Godfather Part II. Aquaman and the guy that played Cyborg were surprisingly good. Ezra Miller breaks even on the annoying/adorkable front. And Affleck is still a decent actor in a dodgy suit and a flaccid, jibbering thankless role.
It's 90% exposition and contrivance, 90% CGI and 110% reshoots. Basically think of everything bad that happens in movies you hate and this one pretty much has it all. It even has four poor Russians living near a nuclear reactor who have cracks in the wall with the shotgun on it, candles because, you know, they're poor, and a Russian nesting doll because, you know, they're Russians. That's basically says it all about this move. Neither Snyder, nor Whedon, nor Warners are at fault for this movie alone; absolutely every single person that worked on it from caterers to casting agents, from runners to ringleaders should all equally share the blame for this fairly inoffensive but undoubted waste of everybody's time."

","This is a movie which has divided the professional critics and the general public with the former being hard on the work but the latter generally enjoying it. I confess that my feelings fall somewhere between the two. It seems that DC Comics just cannot replicate the success of Marvel Universe's Avengers.<br/><br/>Superman is dead but the Earth is under great threat and so Batman and Wonder Woman put together a league of superheroes, adding Aquaman, Cyborg, and the Flash to the team facing somebody called Steppenwolf. The movie has considerable visual appeal with a whole variety of locations and worlds and lots of crashing action, but the plot is weak - yet again a small number of objects of great power which must not be brought together - and the characters (too many of them) are of variable impact.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is dull as Batman, never achieving Christian Bale's convincing portrayal of the role, and it is Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman - fresh from her success in her stand-alone appearance - who is the most appealing character, not least because we know so little of the back story of the other three league members. As for the huge and ugly villain Steppenwolf, he is just like so many other sci-fi bad guys and his entourage of flying warriors looks too much like the monkeys in ""The Wizard Of Oz"".<br/><br/>The film had a troubled production with original director Zack Snyder - who helmed ""Man Of Steel"" and ""Batman vs Superman"" - having to step aside and leaving the final shooting to Joss Wheldon. This mixed heritage is combined with a confusion of tone with the work unsure whether it wants to be as serious as the previous two films or more comedic in the vein of ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"". There are extra scenes at the very beginning and the very end of the credits."
"pedroquintaoo","7","1","7","23 November 2017"," Fine but not perfect
","My expectations were low after the bad reviews from the critics and because I disliked Batman V Superman. Justice League is an average super-hero movie, has great scenes, the heroes are amazing but the biggest problem is the lack of backstory about them. I mean, I would love to know the past events of Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman and even Batman. Perhaps that's the reason why some people hates the films from DC Extended Universe. Batman V Superman, Suicide Squad and Justice League throw us into the middle of a unknown story, they have some great heroes but don't show the backstory of them.<br/><br/>Honestly, it deserved at least more 30 minutes of additional footage. We should see some scenes explaining the backstory of Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman. Oh, one of the things I hated most about the movie was that GROSS and AGGRESSIVE cut after the first battle against Steppenwolf, when the heroes are in that Batman vehicle, almost falling off a cliff, Cyborg abandons them and in the next cut they are all safe in land. I asked myself, ""What the hell happened?"". Oh, and in the same scene, I wondered how Aquaman knew where the heroes were? He came later, already at the end of the battle.<br/><br/>Justice League would be so much better if they produced some movies about Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman and Batman before. They wanted to do everything very fast, should have produced the movies in this chronology:<br/><br/>Man of Steel (2013), then The Batman (2014) this film could explained the dark past o Batman and what happened to Robin, whose fact is shown in Batman V Superman. Finally, Batman V Superman (2015), the idea of ​​the movie is great but the mistake was the too serious tone, that bothered me. Suicide Squad (2016) with a simpler story, dark humor, Rated R violence and we could have something different and perfect. Followed by Wonder Woman (2016), then by Flash (2017), that movie would show the past of this hero before Justice League. Aquaman (2017), and the phase one would conclude with Justice League (2018) At this point, the general public would be familiarized with the heroes from DC, the universe would already be established in the cinema. I bet it would have more success in the box office and between the critics. And from here they could start a Phase Two, we could get more movies per year, with new heroes and new sequels, such as:<br/><br/>Green Lantern (2018), Batman 2 (2018) with Batgirl, Catwoman and Nightwing, then Wonder Woman 2 (2019), following Shazam (2019) Flashpoint - 2019 and finally Justice League 2 (2020), this film could include new heroes like Martian Hunter.<br/><br/>From now on, I hope Warner Bros starts to work and planning the things better. Justice League is not bad but had potential to be great, however is just a nice movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 6.5/10"

The music at times sounded much like ""The Avengers"" for sure. Computer Generated Imagery was somewhat alright except for Steppenwolf, who looked like a Mutated Malekith.

","This movie demonstrates that the people in charge of the DC Universe have been learning the lessons of what they have been doing wrong and what Marvel has been doing right, in a mechanical fashion, if nothing else. The right things include hiring Joss Whedon to work over matters, because not everyone spends every second of every day being a miserable meanie, and that different things motivate different people. Some of the things they have learned that are wrong include 1: a dorky, brilliant teenager makes a great character, so let's make the Flash Spiderman; 2: the relationship between Paranoid Batman and everyone else doesn't work, so let's just.... gloss that over awkwardly, by having him behave awkwardly over it.<br/><br/>That's fine, because these are all people who do not Play Well with Others. On the plus side, one thing DC figured out was how to deal with the Rock-em-Sock-em Robots battle, by putting in grades of robots, and noticing that there are actually civilians on the battlefield, and assigning some people to actually getting them out of the way of the FREAKING HOLOCAUST THAT'S APPEARING RIGHT AROUND THEM! On the other hand, the second third of the movie turns into Waiting for Superman, since once the Man of Steel shows up, neither G*d nor wombat can stand against his might.<br/><br/>Mind you, I stopped reading comic books in 1969, and hadn't bothered with DC for half a decade before then.

","""People said the Age of Heroes would never come again.""Diana (Gail Godot)<br/><br/>The super heroes of filmdom do come again, this time in Justice League, the DC equivalent of Marvel's Avengers and other comic book communal power sharing. Smartly producers are seeing that a super hero like Superman (Henry Cavill) or Batman (Ben Affleck) is better served by having more heroes to expand audience and humanize.<br/><br/>In Justice League, Diana Prince is a welcome leader, having jumped into that spot no doubt because of her box office success in Wonder Woman early in 2017. Here she teams up with Cyborg, Flash, Batman, Aquaman, and Superman (recently resurrected) to defeat Steppenwolf (voice of Ciaran Hinds), who is bent on bringing back power and global destruction to the dark side. The team motif, so popular in pulp fiction and sci fi these days, is best expressed by Commissioner Gordon (J.K. Simmons) to Batman: ""Good to see you playing with others again."" <br/><br/>Oh, well, nothing new here, especially with the usual out-of-date explosions and knock-abouts, both to me not worthy of advanced sci-fi but along with bullets, staples of the genre. The reliance here on fist fighting and gun shooting seems beneath the dignity of advanced civilizations such as ours. The banter is banal, and the wonder of the Wonder Woman film earlier this year places this epic in mediocre land far, far away from the Amazons.<br/><br/>With so much run-of-the-mill CGI as a central focus, no wonder plot is thin and characterization superficial. While director Zack Snyder tries to give enough time to each character to develop, too many of them mean too little rounding out their personalities and lives. <br/><br/>What we have is what we have—a middling story of the same stuff told with characters just waiting for their own next motion picture.

","It's astounding to consider that a movie that cost as much as ""Justice League"" could end up looking so ugly. With a drained color palette, an overabundance of exposition, and few likable characters around, the movie is a drag to sit through: Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill are dour and boring as Batman and Superman, respectively, with each bringing the momentum to a screeching halt whenever on screen. That leaves the rest of the characters with little to do beyond an occasional blip of CGI-assisted action, neutering Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman along the way and wasting Jason Momoa's Aquaman, while Ezra Miller seems to be acting in a different movie altogether (Ray Fisher's Cyborg barely registers as either a character or a superhero). The climax is a confusing blur of cheap-looking CGI that elicits groans before the end credits finally roll, with the movie having wasted every bit of its audience's good will on the way there. Perhaps it's time for Zack Snyder to step aside and for Warner to figure out what tone their DC Universe entries should have before they commission the next one."

I'm the guy who watches Man of Steel and defended it, watched Batman vs. Superman and loved it and defended it, and I thought that Wonder Woman was the movie that put the DCEU in the right place as it was loved by both critics and fans, and how Justice League could follow that, but I was wrong. To give credit to the movie, we all should have know this movie was not going to be great due to multiple reasons, the main being the movie going through two directors with two different tones for the movie and Warner Brothers forcing a runtime for this movie. I believe it was not fair to Zach who built the DCEU, to be fired and from Warner Brothers to hide it with the passing of his daughter. This movie had many problems, from the bland villain, to terrible character development. Superman was a CGI monstrosity, Batman was trying to be funny when he shouldn't be and was as useless as Slingshot in Suicide Squad, Flash and Cyborg were so poorly written, and SteppenWolf had no Villain backstory. The only true highlights of this movie were Wonder Woman and Aquaman, so here's to Aquaman when it comes out. I would give this movie a lower rating, but as a DC fanboy, I didn't have the heart to give it lower than a 6."

It did not work with Suiciede Squad, and it did not work with Batman Vs Superman. <br/><br/>The good thing about the DC characters is that we can relate to them as humans, these characters they have created are probably the worst part of this ""new"" franchise. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck in a couple of movies after battling the most powerful aliens in the universe, will go back to fighting Joker and Harley? <br/><br/>I do not know who writes this bad for Hollywood and who approves this! <br/><br/>They should have kept to what we loved about the Nolan Scripts!

"MaccyXpert","8","1","11","23 November 2017"," Decent entertainment, but there's still a lot of room for improvement
","So, this obviously has quite a bit of stuff to unpack, being a huge movie - marketing, budget, time spent, scale, etc. I want to start by focusing on the points made on Wikipedia, then continuing from there into whatever else I have to say. <br/><br/>The action sequences and performances were praised. Now, if you don't nail the action sequences in a SUPERHERO movie, it's not gonna be that good of a superhero movie. I'll admit, they were pretty well done (I don't think they were, ""chaotic,"" as RT says); just perhaps done in excess (Zack Snyder tings) and unfortunately replacing proper character development.<br/><br/>This leads into the performances, which were weirdly uneven across the team - I'd say Miller (The Flash) takes the top spot, with Momoa (Aquaman) getting second place. I think Cyborg (Fisher) had the least development in the team, and his character was partially boring, along with his somewhat dull performance. I get that the DCEU has already made movies for the 3 more significant members (Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman), but you could've done a lot more and just spent more time on the movie (which is only 2 hours, not almost 3, as some prankster decided to show online). I mean, I would've liked to see what they could've done with almost 3 hours and a better director (PATTY JENKINS FFS), who might not have even needed that much time. Most of the development they try is weak (like interactions with parents and how the superheroes view themselves). This action/character imbalance is kind of expected from Snyder at this point (this will lead up to a point I make at the end). <br/><br/>Now for the criticisms *cracks fingers* - a thin plot, weak villain and overuse of CGI. On the first point, I didn't exactly think the plot was bad, but I'm assuming, ""thin,"" means a lack of depth, because that's certainly true. I could make the same point about the length - should've been longer to enhance the plot in some way. It was kind of the stereotyped superhero movie plot of some extraterrestrial being coming to destroy/conquer Earth, but ultimately losing because it's a movie (that's not a spoiler; you knew it was gonna happen)<br/><br/>I'm not gonna say much about Steppenwolf now; I reckon that I'll kind of ruin him for you guys. The CGI, however, was EVERYWHERE. I do think that it was used unnecessarily at many points (action sequences, along with designs and aesthetics of locations, even Cyborg's looks) and that they should have used practical effects more often (the lack of it kinda screws with the physics on some occasions and makes situations seem unrealistic even by superhero movie standards). I get that you like to stylise your action, but keep it logical, otherwise you're just not really caring about rules and it's going to stand out in a bad way.<br/><br/>The tone was very up-and-down, with some calling it lighter than before (yeah, kinda) but others calling it inconsistent (I agree with this more). It went from dark and dramatic (e.g. Diana's meh exposition about how Steppenwolf came to be) to comedic and more human (e.g. Flash just having fun with the others). You know, the funny thing is that because Snyder left the movie (his daughter died; I understand) early, they got in Joss Whedon (who directed THE AVENGERS) to direct some scenes, eventually getting a screenplay (writing) credit at the end. Given the styles of each director, it wouldn't be hard to pick out whom you would credit for certain scenes. I don't think Joss would be the type of guy to intentionally screw with DC to give Marvel a bonus (MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA) - DC's already in the gutter; Marvel need not worry. <br/><br/>Because of the overall quality of the DCEU so far (except Wonder Woman - I know we have some critics here, but the general consensus is good), I just think that there was too much hype leading up to Justice League. I know that it's a big superhero movie and all the kids are gonna be excited, but none of the others (Patty Jenkins, you can leave the room now) have really nailed it like they should have. Sure, Justice League was an improvement over past efforts, but there's still a LOT of room for improvement. I'm not even thinking about Marvel comparisons here; the DCEU just needs to do justice (haha) to their huge superhero universe and upgrade itself as a movie franchise. Whether or not that'll happen, I'm not sure, because it seems like money is mostly their concern instead of actual film quality (even though higher quality can mean higher earnings). I don't care about the whole critics-VS-audiences thing; it's possible to make a movie that gets both of them (and Internet users) fired up (actually, Patty, come back for a moment, please). However, I do think the critics were a bit too harsh; I was expecting an RT score in the 40-60 range (it just barely gets in with 41%, not to mention a 42% difference between critics and audiences as of now)."
"LiveLoveLead","6","1","12","23 March 2019"," Disapointing...
","Kind of a let down for me. Dark. Slow. Pretentious. Boring. Little character development. The characters were barely likable in this. Flash was the tiny bit of comic relief. Brooding Batman and Cyborg were annoying. This film is also very similar in plot to Avengers: Infinity War (bad guy wants to destroy the world, so all the superheroes band together to fight him.) But, Avengers was much more entertaining and fun, with better characters, a better script and better paced. This doesn't even come close to the original Batman, Superman, Dark Knight movies. I loved Wonder Woman, enjoyed Suicide Squad, but not BvsS or this one. Disappointing In My Humble Opinion."

Marvel's has took over 10 years to tell it's compete story.
DC made Man of Steel and tried to jump on the bandwagon.
However all they have done is just overload with special effects.
In the fight scene of Avengers: Infinity Wars they used CGI just for certain pieces it was mostly in camera and CGI a tool.
But Justice League it felt like The Matrix had them.
All the CGI in the trilogy worked because they were in a computer. Justice League was meant to feel and look real.

"nirome","5","1","13","11 March 2019"," Promising premise with a messy resolution
","Too many cooks in the kitchen. That's what happened here. When tragedy struck Zack Snyder's life, the producers of Warner Bros took it as an opportunity to change things around and deliver a product that would massively deviate from the tone and style used by Snyder in his previous entries in the DCEU and be a more fan-pleasing and aimed for mass consumption product. The problem is that by trying to blend together such contrasting filming styles, the final cut resulted in one of the most bizarre viewing experiences seen in a long time.
The first act of the movie, with the introduction of the main characters and the main threat, choppily edited though it may be, is competent enough. It's during the second and third acts, that the movie's problems become more glaring. Unfinished and rushed CGI, glaring photographic tones and poorly developed characters and story arcs, are the norm here. That being said, it turned out to be a more enjoyable experience than that of BvS (at least Superman behaves the way he's supposed to). It's just to bad that because of some Warner exec's decisions, the movie turned out to be such a shooting and editing mess, that'll probably cost the planned sequels to be shelved for a very long time."
"Maciste_Brother","4","1","13","1 March 2019"," Where's Zeus when you need him?
","I'm not a fan of CGI and this film is an orgy of CGI. When it's done right, I'm able to digest it to a certain level but most of the CGI here was so 'cartoony' that I could never get into it. The direction feels like a TV production ( claustrophobic sets, unrealistic looking sets, etc). Since almost everything is CGI, including the surroundings, the film feels really cloistered. The lame story is about some Mother Boxes which can destroy the world. These boxes were introduced back in Antiquity by the main alien villain called Steppenwolf. We see a flashback of the events of the distant past with Wonder Woman (a wooden Gal Gadot) recalling the events to Batman (a wooden Ben Affleck). Though the set-up is totally uninspired,. I have to admit that I liked the scenes set in the past more than the modern period (and why I'm giving this 4 stars). As Wonder Woman brings up Batman up to speed about the 'Mother boxes"" we see an orgy of battles, of Amazons, Atlanteans, even of Gods such as Zeus, battling Steppenwolf and his army of aliens (they're from an unspecific alien world). In a brief but powerful moment, we see Zeus (bodybuilder Sergi Constance) 'neutralizing' the Mother Boxes. A defeated Steppenwolf is exiled from earth. Neutralized and with Steppenwolf gone, the Mother Boxes are kept hidden at separate locations around earth. Back in our contemporary time, with Superman 'dead', Steppenwolf shows up again, ready to find and reconnect the 3 Mother Boxes and destroy Earth. Desperate to stop Steppenwolf, Batman and Wonder Woman recruit other superheroes, such as Aquaman and the Flash, in order to team up and annihilate Steppenwolf.<br/><br/>This is basically the gist of the convoluted story. The story makes very little sense. The action makes even less sense.<br/><br/>My question is, if Zeus was able to 'defeat' and neutralize the Mother Boxes thousands of years ago, why didn't the 'Justice League' just try and recruit Zeus again? What happened to him? Was Zeus on vacation? Is he dead? Are the Olympian Gods not worthy of the Justice League? Is Superman the new Zeus?<br/><br/>The weakness of the script is apparent from the start. It shows a solution to the problem the contemporary heroes face at the very start of the film (all powerful Zeus winning over Steppenwolf) but when Steppenwolf decides to cause mayhem again in 2017, suddenly Zeus is nowhere to be found. A poorly written script."
"juliankennedy23","5","1","13","29 January 2019"," Magic Carpet Ride
","Justice League: 5 out of 10: With Superman dead and a new threat headed towards Earth, Batman and Wonder Woman recruit new heroes to join The Justice League.<br/><br/>We all know that the Justice League has five core members. Aquaman, Batman, Robin, Superman, and Wonder Woman. (Turns out Apache Chief, not a core member. I know, I know my youth is ruined.) Of course, Superman is pushing up the Kryptonite and Robin does not um exist so we need two additional recruits and Justice League chooses Cyborg and the Flash. Not the worst choices on paper mind you. Hawkman and Hawkgirl might be hard to put into live action, Green Lantern isn't allowed to appear in another film till hell freezes over, and nobody remembers Black Vulcan.<br/><br/>Originally this was supposed to be a direct sequel to Batman vs. Superman but that film Green Lanterened all over the screen so rewrites galore happened in conjunction with the director leaving due to family tragedy and you have all the earmarks for yet another disaster in the DCU. It isn't that bad overall. Which is strange because I really think it destroyed the Justice League forever. I will attempt and fail to explain below.<br/><br/>The Players:<br/><br/>Superman: I know he is dead but therein lies the rub. Zack Snyder's Superman was awful. He was awful in Man of Steel and he was awful in Batman vs. Superman. Others have put out extensive essays and youtube video series explaining why Snyder's Superman was so awful. It is practically it's own cottage industry now. This isn't nostalgia for Reeves Superman mind you, I remember Superman 3 and 4. My rose-colored glasses are not on here. Snyder's read on the character is just wrong. He writes Superman as a creepy alien who views humans as insects and that is not the character. It is a character just not one called Superman.<br/><br/>Justice League finally realizes this and tries to change the history to make dead Superman a much nicer guy than the live one ever was. There is some truth in television here as often celebrities that were the worst people in the world are suddenly lionized in death. Michael Jackson was a creepy child molester the day before he dies and was nothing but a lost child saint the day after. That said this is clearly a late in the game rewrite and it shows. Making Snyder's Superman a little schizophrenic and well as his previous sociopathic tendencies.<br/><br/>There hasn't been a good Superman movie since Superman 2 and this film doesn't change that. One thing that has changed is people are no longer blaming actor Henry Cavill. After his delightful turn in Mission Impossible Fallout, he is fully redeemed. As long as he sports a mustache.<br/><br/>Batman: Ben Affleck plays Bruce Wayne/Batman as a fat alcoholic man in a bat suit going through the motions cause he really doesn't know what else to do. It is a great characterization that deserves a much better movie. More importantly, it deserves a movie without distractions like other superheroes or even really supervillains. Certainly not CGI space villains. I say chuck it all a do a proper version of The Dark Knight Returns set in the eighties. Affleck's Batman would be perfect for that. (Yes I know that Batman vs Superman was basically a modern version of that so I am simply wrong here. He just seems like he would be great. Maybe he can get his back broken by Bane instead? I am spitballing here). Affleck's Batman just seems the wrong kind of Batman to be putting together a Justice League. Nice suit though (His business suits are really spot on in this.)<br/><br/>Wonder Woman: If there was ever a woman that needed to upgrade the men she hung out with this is her. She is very good. She clearly belongs with a better class of hero. Perhaps The Tick or Booster Gold.<br/><br/>Aquaman: I mean this guy is a joke. C'mon. His scenes in Aqualand or whatever in this movie are four guys and Amanda Heard in a fish tank. Seriously this is the next movie from DC. This ridiculous of such a movie was a plot point for an entire season of Entourage. I doubt they will ever make an Aquaman stand-alone film let alone release it. Oh, it already came out? It is the highest grossing DC film of all time with over a billion dollars of box office? I like Jason Momoa and you can really see in this film he is a breakout star.<br/><br/>Cyborg: I learn so much for writing these reviews. Did you know Black Vulcan was a scab? It's true. The actual African American electricity based superhero Black Lightning could not appear on superfriends due to a contract dispute so Black Vulcan was hired as his non-union replacement (I am really not making any of this up). In the realm of African American superheroes, the DC universe does not have that deep a bench. Plus the kids love Cyborg due to his membership in the Teen Titans. Too bad he is so bloody dull in Justice League. Of course, there are worse things to be than dull which brings us to...<br/><br/>The Flash: Hey kids lets hire an annoying millennial stereotype (Ezra Miller) to play an annoying millennial stereotype. That could not possibly ever get old. Good news Gleek you are no longer the most annoying member of the Superfriends.<br/><br/>Many people blamed latecomer Joss Whedon but The Flash's character was established long before he took the helm. I have a feeling this is a disaster by committee job. The idea of a standalone film with this character is downright exausting.<br/><br/>Steppenwolf: While Flash may be the most irritating Justice League character he isn't even the worst character in this film. That would be our CGI baddie Steppenwolf. Why do you need CGI for a tall guy with horns? I do not know. Does he have an army of non-descript CGI mooks? You betcha, Is he seeking some glowing things hidden on earth so he can take over the universe? Darn tootin. Steppenwolf is after the three Mother Boxes. (Not Martha Boxes which would actually be kind of funny). The Mother Boxes are hidden in Lesbian Island, Aqualand and at Cyborg's dad's house. Hidden may be the wrong term to use here now I think about it.<br/><br/>Is Steppenwolf the worst Superhero villain ever to appear on the screen? No. He is the third worst villain to appear on screen tied with that CGI Masters of the Universe reject at the end of Suicide Squad. The second worst villain is the Sun Superman Luthor creates in Superman IV who could be defeated by evening or perhaps a heavy cloud cover and the worst is the villain from Thor: The Dark World whose greatest ability is that no one can remember who he was even if they had just seen the film. (Magic Dark Elf I want to say.)<br/><br/>Steppenwolf is a non-event. Yes, I read his Wikipedia page and apparently, he is a New God created by Jack Kirby and Darkseid's uncle but none of that makes the screen. He isn't scary, he isn't funny and he doesn't have a decent theme song. I mean at least have Born to be Wild or Magic Carpet Ride play when he attacks.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: Bill Mahr attacked geekdom in general when Stan Lee died. It was tasteless and inflammatory but he did have a point or two. I can't help think that walking through his HBO offices every morning he saw Steppenwolf grabbing the glowing Mother Boxes on the monitors there and it painted his world view. He blamed Stan Lee but once again it was Jack Kirby that deserved the blame."
"rix_1000","7","1","13","15 November 2017"," DC - you are not Marvel!
","This will not be your average movie review, but something more...<br/><br/>Before all the DC fanboys will jump at my throat, I will say that Im a big DC fan and I love the characters more than I do Marvel's, but there is no denying that Marvel is knocking their movies out of the park and surpassing DC critically and financially. That being said, I've always respected DC for being different from Marvel and doing its own thing. Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice were both controversial movies, but they did have their own signature. Zack Snyder has always had the unbelievably unique ability to transfer the pages of a comic book to the silver screen beautifully and that is also evident in Justice League's intro. But with the change of directors and Whedon taking over, that signature and that dark vibe was lost. I am aware that the popular opinion is that DC movies are too dark and somber and that they have no soul. This is where I disagree. They have soul and Id say that they have even deeper character developments than many of the Marvel movies. BvS is one of the realest and most intelligent comic book movies ever created. It is by no means a perfect movie, but it is a very grown up superhero film. And this is where I give high praise to what DC has done. Somewhere along the lines Whedon tried to make this into an Avengers movie and while that is a very delightful idea, it just fell short because of the already different vibe and style of the movie that was started. He tried to change it and bring more light-heartedness to it, but that should have been done in the conception of the film, not with re-shoots and gap-fillers. Most people will say that Ezra Miller's Barry Allen was the most fun character and he brought much- needed life into Justice League, I actually thought most of his comedic lines were forced and childish. And childish is a word that I would use to describe this movie. It felt very glossy and fluffy, especially in the final act. There were funny puns and one-liners with impressive CGI fights, but there was no weight behind it. This is where I contemplated the idea that DC tried to manage their movie into something very Marvel-like, but unsuccessfully in my humble opinion. And with that being said I think that Cyborg was the true break-out star of this movie. Ray Fisher down-played his character and he did it with finesse and subtlety which worked perfectly with his tragic backstory. All-in-all I will NEVER give up on DC movies, even after stinkers like The Suicide Squad, but I really hope that they stick to their style and not try to mimic what Marvel is doing. DC, do not rush your movies...you will stumble, you will fall, but in time, you will reach your destination. In time You will accomplish wonders..."

This is exactly why I don´t watch superheromovies anymore."
"Random-Person-With-Opinions","1","1","16","17 January 2019"," I wanted to like this
","Watch as DC tries to achieve a success but misses by a long shot. Before people dismiss my criticisms as being a ""DC Hater"" or someone who was paid by Marvel to give this movie a bad review, I actually wanted this movie to be good. I liked Gal Gadot in Wonder Woman and thought that Ezra Miller had potential to be a good Barry Allen. Unfortunately, I was let down.
With confused writing and yet another CGI villain, Justice League falls flat on it's face. Part of the issue comes from the switching in tone after Snyder left the project and Whedon was signed on due to a tragedy in Snyder's family. I found it disappointing that the other members of the league did next to nothing in the final battle against the main villain next to the newly resurrected Superman and his never-ending Jesus symbolism, proving that the whole subplot of Superman being dead adds nothing to the plot when he's brought back to do everything instead of giving a chance to the newer additions, like the Flash and Cyborg, to actually do something of importance in this film besides showing up and watching as action happens. Affleck's portrayal of Batman is one of the worst parts of the movie. The tonal shift in this movie hits Batman the hardest, seeing that one minute he's grim and mysterious, and the next he makes jokes and attempts to seem ""more humane"" by making jokes: ""I guess I do bleed!"" and when asked what his superpowers were, he responds smiling ""I'm rich.""
This movie had potential with it's casting, but all of this flies out the window and drags on for what seems like hours. The villain in this movie, who I don't even remember the name of, serves as a punching bag. No real depth at all in his character, and he poses no real threat compared to the resurrected Caped Jesus that is Superman and his ""team"". If you're looking for a good time, you're in the wrong place, as the bad things outweigh the good but tons. Not recommended in the slightest."
"undeaddt","6","1","17","4 January 2019"," Slightly dissapointed.
","To be honest, I've always favoured DCU over Marvel CU, but this movie is dissapointing. With a budget of 300 million $ they could've done so much more because the movie feels blank, lacking content, lacking environment, lacking character introduction, it lacks everything. When you compare the visual effects and the CGI with the budget, you must admit it is crap, it is over animated and to vivid. Batman does almost nothing throughout the whole movie and yes. Superman is overpowered, but alongside him, they made the other heroes look like they mean nothing."
"bfml-03018","5","1","19","9 January 2019"," A movie that doesn't even know if is good or bad
","Justice league is a Frankenstein, the story is badly developed and with characters who don't have depth even when are trying. Things just happens in an inconsistent film with tone, direction and even threath level.
The cgi is bad, the action scenes are just ok and seeing the most classical team for the first time isn't exciting. It does have good moments, but only that."

","When Earth becomes threatened by an old enemy who's come back to reunite the three power boxes, Batman realizes that he's going to need all the help he can get. Slowly, he starts to assemble a team but as every team needs a leader, he might need to bring back an old ""friend"".<br/><br/>It's a superhero movie which only from its title reminded me of the beloved cartoons with the same name so I simply had to see it. Unfortunately, what I saw was a bit far from my expectations. It's story is lame to say the least. An old enemy comes to threaten the world so Batman starts recruiting and that's about it. Everyone seems to be willing to join without much hesitation so they start to fight. It's too simple, linear and predictable to make justice for a movie with this title. The characters are not very likeable, having very limited dialog, almost if they were paid by the number of words spoken, and when they do, nothing memorable or even worth mentioning comes out of the actors' mouths. Thus, very little emotion can be generated from such a movie and it's a shame, as it tries to introduce a fair amount of drama but fails miserably.<br/><br/>It simply feels mediocre. From the story, characters and even actors to the action itself. You get a couple of fights and some CGI moments which are a bit more intense but nothing than can keep you breathless. As it also is pretty predictable, almost nothing seems satisfying enough. I know that all seems bad but it's not as bad as it sounds. It's just that I really had some expectations from it, especially as I've seen Aquaman first, and most of them were completely destroyed. It simply doesn't have a story which is capable of getting the most of the characters it has, making them feel weak an even useless at times. They even have an antagonist which feels as lame as the rest of the story and somehow manages to dominate the action every single time.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, this movie is a failed attempt at bringing back the Justice League in live action. It has a bad plot which isn't able to keep up with the weight of its characters, thus making them look bad. The movie doesn't do anything great in any department and this can be easily seen. Even the visual part isn't as spectacular as it could and should have been. You're simply left with the impression that it's a cheap film, average in every aspect with nothing that can make it stand out from mediocrity. Not even its cast couldn't raise it, and this is a great shame."

","'Justice League' follows directly on 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice', so I suggest watching that first.<br/><br/>'Justice League' is an incredible display of CGI. The film plays like a live action cartoon and some of the action scenes are incredible with amazing visuals.<br/><br/>The film is about antagonist Steppenwolf sourcing three boxes scattered around the globe, that will give him absolute power. This might seem very cliched, and yes, it is. Steppenwolf itself is entirely a CGI creation. Blending CGI with reality is easy nowadays. Making it realistic is an entirely different matter. Although they did a great job with 'Justice League', the CGI overload renders most of the film completely unbelievable. There really is not an inch of reality during the action scenes. It is maybe a bit too fantastical an unrealistic.<br/><br/>Just like Marvel's 'The Avengers' there are too many protagonists for one film, resulting in some of them having limited screen time. Superman, for example, doesn't show up until past the halfway mark. Batman carries the film, but then, this is not a Batman film. I therefore have mixed feelings about the film. If you're in the mood for action overload with CGI effects galore, then this is the perfect choice. If you're looking for something more substantial, well then, this might not be the wisest choice.<br/><br/>Would I watch it again?

"fciocca","5","0","1","17 November 2019"," A missed opportunity for the most important movie in the DC Extended Universe
","""Justice League"" brings together the most iconic superheroes of DC comics to defeat evil once again. So, this should have been the most important movie in the DC Extended Universe, it should have been something different, original and with charismatic and memorable characters.<br/><br/>The plot is always the same, an evil mastermind wants to destroy the Earth and conquer the universe. I don't even want to criticize this, obviously if Hollywood keeps doing movie with a story seen already many times, it means that is a formula that works and sells. So let's take a quick look to characters, I really liked Batman and Wonder Woman, for me the best two heroes in the Justice League. Flash was just okay, he just add a little bit of comedy in the movie, but that's all, he never stands out. Comprehensible, being his first ride as a superhero, but honestly you forget him easily. Cyborg is the guy that is taking care of all the technological stuff, basically a war machine. Aquaman, a useless character, the final battle is in fact located in a complete dried location, so he cannot even use his powers at best. And last, but not least Superman, that will come back, just to be in some filler scenes and in the last 5 minutes of the final battle and only because all the other heroes were struggling.<br/><br/>In the end I've understood that everything could have been solved by Superman alone, so all the other characters are basically useless. Honestly from this movie I was really expecting more: I am a fan of the DC Extended Universe but, in this case I just watched the average superhero movie pumped with CGI and very few practical stunts scenes. A big step back from ""Batman V. Superman"", which started to give me hope about this cinematic universe."
"freewillyfan","5","0","1","9 November 2019"," Justice League
","Justice League is a generic and forgettable movie. The plot wasn't too interesting, the new characters were not developed well. Batman was even quite boring compared to how he was in BvS. Superman was alright but that flight scene with him against the rest of the Justice League felt very out of place and he had two of the cheesiest lines in this film. The CGI was bad and the villain was terrible. Some of the humour was good and some decent action. The plot wasn't anything special and there wasn't really anything that was very memorable about this film. Overall a disappointing first team up film for the DCEU.<br/><br/>5.5/10"

I sense an anger towards the DC executives that ruined this stand-alone franchise with their stupid decisions and let me, and million other fans down. They made us to lose hope in DCEU and the ironic part is that Superman, one of DC's main milestone, reflects the symbol of hope.<br/><br/>In the end, I hope WB release tge Director's Cut soon.

","*The ""movie"" that I'm going to review today is called: ""You Can't Save the World Alone"". Wait, what's that? This ""film"" is called ""Justice League""? You would never know unless you look at the poster with magnifying glasses! Wow, even the poster designer was too embarrassed to acknowledge that this was a ""Justice League"" film. That's pretty bad, isn't it? What a lousy poster, and they don't even have the lousy excuse for Superman on the poster, or Green Lantern! Wow, did they get one thing right?! Film Making 101: the poster should match the concept of the movie you're trying to express, it should not be designed to infuriate people! That's not a good sign when the poster aggravates you before you actually watch the ""movie"" itself, what little there actually is!*<br/><br/>""Justice League"" (2017), this was one of the most highly anticipated superhero films of all-time. People have been waiting for years to see a live-action ""Justice League"" film, and this is what we get. They blew it, again! How is this possible?! Warner Bros. Pictures, you own the rights to all of these phenomenal comic book characters and stories, and this is how you express them?! Terrible acting, boring sets/locations, cheap special effects, and an underwhelming soundtrack. The only real passable performance in this ""film"" is from Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. She seems to be the only actor who's actually trying. Everyone else is lackluster, and they put on surprisingly even worse performances in this ""movie"" than in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016). How?! Ben Affleck is boring, Ezra Miller as The Flash is cringeworthy and obnoxious, Ray Fisher plays a dull Cyborg, Jason Momoa is overrated and cringeworthy as Aquaman, and of course Henry Cavill is an insult to the real Superman; Christopher Reeve. Spoiler alert, not that there's anything worth spoiling in this ""film"" though. They bring the ""Superman character"" back to life, but they really should have brought Christopher Reeve back to life rather than Henry Cavill! Also, there is no Green Lantern, who is supposed to be one of the original members of the team. That made a lot of comic book and movie fans furious. Film Making 101: if you're making a movie about a group of people, then make sure all the characters are included! The sets/locations are dull, and are obviously filmed using either blue screen or green screen. It's pretty bad when you can actually tell that the backgrounds are fake! The only real sets used are just plain dull and unoriginal. As for the special effects, I don't even know where to begin with those! To keep a long story short, I've seen more realistic special effects and animation on Playstation video games! Another thing, The Flash does not give off lightning when he runs. I can understand breaking the sound barrier, but he does not produce lightning! Who approved of that idea?! But probably the worst effect is Cavill's CGI face to hide his mustache. The reason he didn't shave was because he was in the middle of filming a real movie; ""Mission: Impossible-Fallout"" (2018). He made the right move choosing to stay 100% faithful to that movie rather than this embarrassing ""Justice League"" parody! The soundtrack has good moments, but overall it's just underwhelming. Danny Elfman is one of my top 10 favorite music composers in cinema. But this one is just feels jumbled and generic in most places. Even the most perfect film makers and music composers have to have at least one dud, and unfortunately this was one of Elfman's worst. The opening credits song is one of the most cringeworthy and out of place songs I've heard in any movie. But the biggest insult is the use of John Williams' ""Superman"" theme when Henry Cavill in a poorly made Superman costume shows up. That just added salt to the wound! How dare you use that music in this travesty of a ""movie""?! That's an insult to the real Man of Steel, Christopher Reeve! This ""film"" is not worth that theme in the slightest. There is one good thing I can salvage from this diarrhea dump of a ""film"", the story. That doesn't mean it's good, but it had a clear focus and stuck to one storyline, with very little to no subplots getting in the way. Overall, ""Justice League"" is yet another dull, boring and unpleasant viewing experience in the sorry lineup of modern live action DC films. Maybe we'll get a real live-action ""Justice League"" film someday. I give this ""movie"" 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. One thing I figured I'd point out is that this movie effectively had two different directors overseeing the production; Zack Snyder and Joss Whedon. The reason why is because Snyder's daughter committed suicide during the making of ""Justice League"", R.I.P. Maybe she was embarrassed to be related to a terrible film maker? Hmmmm..... With the ""movie"" unfinished, Joss Whedon stepped in to finish it. Wow, he switched from Marvel to DC? Bad career move! With two different directors, the ""movie"" had an inconsistent tone. Snyder has terrible taste in directors by choosing Whedon, he should have been aware of the failure known as ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015), directed by Joss Whedon and set out to find a better director! Bottom line is, ""Justice League"" does not do the original superheroes justice. Hopefully if they reboot DC, which they should, we'll get a proper ""Justice League"" movie. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this ""film"" as possible. You'll really be doing yourself justice!"

"renofhate","6","0","4","19 September 2019"," Mind-blowing? No. Jaw-dropping? No. Mindless entertainment and fun? Sure. Here's Justice League.
","Well if it isn't Zack Snyder once again, people; a director I've had a love-hate relationship with for many years now. Let's get this out of the way: the guy doesn't really know a whole lot about comic books and representation/portrayal, but you can't say the guy doesn't know a thing. He does, albeit not an abundance of. Oh, and let me get one more thing out of the way: I DESPISE the way Wonder Woman says, ""Kal-El, no."" before they face off against Superman. I don't know, it just annoys me so much. But let's talk about the movie itself. How is Justice League? On a scale of 0-100, it's about a 65. Or 6.5/10. Sure, you could arguably round it up to 7, but I'm keeping it at 6. The visual effects, at times, are absolutely fine, then they're god-awful and the film looks cheap, messy, and can come across as both lazy and lousy. The performances aren't incredible but they're pretty good. I kinda like Ben Affleck as Batman, but then I remember I prefer Keaton, Conroy, Bale, etc. Hey, at least he's more entertaining than George Clooney and Val Kilmer when it comes to portraying the character, at least in my opinion. Gal Gadot is okay, but she was so much better in her own film. I'd say she's about the same here as she was in Batman v Superman - so just okay/decent. Jason Mamoa is pretty good as Aquaman, I won't lie. Almost the standout character for me, thus I definitely gotta check out his solo movie. Ezra Miller is pretty good as the Flash I'd say. Some of his lines that are meant to be funny aren't all that funny though. The humour can feel a little forced in general though, or just plain unfunny. And of course Henry Cavil as Superman, for the third (and final?) time was pretty good, but mainly that's because of the battle between him in the others was, for the most part, cool to see. But he overpowers them all and, while he is the most powerful of them for sure, I can't help but wonder what would have happened had they got some attacks in. Superman is meant to be this powerful but I kinda feel that sometimes we see him in an overpowering state with Cavil as if he actually could be somewhat more powerful and a little antagonistic (cheers Zack and the gang), but it's cool. And Steppenwolf and his Parademons seemed a pretty good threat until Supes came in, who basically destroyed Steppenwolf without even trying. The villain was cool, but not enough for me to believe he was a massive threat after Superman basically killed him with a punch, you know, despite being made out to be such a monster and the world was on brink of chaotic collapse. Overall, Justice League is a pretty decent film, there are lots of flaws but it makes up for some of them at times thanks to action, some heartfelt moments, and of course the team itself - the Justice League.
Standouts: Aquaman, Superman, Superman vs Justice League, (and for the most part, not entirely, but most) the final battle.

Having recruited the best in the business, the team must band together to battle against the evil Steppenwolf and his army whom are trying to find 3 mother boxes which are securely hidden in various locations. However, given the sheer power of their enemy have our band of superheroes perhaps bitten off more than they can chew?<br/><br/>I haven't seen Batman vs Superman prior to watching this film and therefore was unaware that Justice League linked back to BVS so you may have to bear with me here, but here are my thoughts on this film...<br/><br/>As I've said in my summary, this film is quite entertaining; it has plenty of action in order to try to keep things moving. The character introductions were done in a steady fashion again without being overdone (no unnecessarily elongated back stories). At times there is some good camaraderie between the characters; unfortunately this isn't a consistent aspect of the film and there are many occasions when the film is a little dry and serious - The Flash is clearly there to offset some of this and is one of the best things about this film.<br/><br/>I think the main problem with this film is just how unmemorable it all is whether it be the acting or the story; I haven't seen Batman vs Superman, but for me Affleck just is not a very good Batman; I think Affleck is partly to blame as his performance is not great, but I think what makes things worse is how little is done with his character. Gadot is not the best of actresses, but as Wonder Woman she does at least have some fire about her (plus a pair of legs that go on forever and a few shots of her rather nice derriere). Cyborg is just a miserable git (understandable to an extent given what has happened to him), but his character is pretty bland and fails to make any memorable contribution to the film. As The Flash, Miller is at least fun and as I mentioned earlier, I think Snyder used him here to counter-balance the serious tone, but Miller can't really do this on his own (although he does his best). Momoa is OK, but again his is not a particularly memorable contribution.<br/><br/>Even if you look at the action scenes which are entertaining to a degree they don't have much imagination (with the exception of Wonder Woman everyone seems to fight by throwing each other into things which becomes repetitive). The story is serviceable, but again isn't all that interesting and at times I found myself waiting for the next action scene (which clearly means there's a problem).<br/><br/>So yes it's entertaining & humourous in spots with occasional moments of good camaraderie between the superheroes, but with a number of forgettable performances and a pretty unmemorable story it doesn't really cut the mustard. Give me The Avengers any time."

","The movie starts with a scene where batman whom everybody feared (in the previous movie) trying to catch a creature that feeds on fear so he tortured a nameless character to lure out that creature and he succeeds , my problem with this scene is that in the previous movie batman was established as a feared entity that everyone is afraid from like a demon but here he's more of a guy in a Halloween costume , like someone acting like batman but not batman , the colors of the scene made it really out of place considering the much darker color of the previous movies<br/><br/>here i have to talk about the other characters of the justice league , they didn't have any time to show who they are especially cyborg who suffered from a trauma like that of the robocop but they didn't talk about it , the same could be said for the flash who was closer to a silly than a funny character , aquaman was actions were not justified and appeared to come out without any reason based on what appeared to be closed enclave he was associated with
the worst problem is inconsistency , they weren't sure how they want to depict these people , sometimes they are strong and imposing and sometimes they were funny and goofy , that was distracting but that maybe because it had 2 different directors<br/><br/>then there's steppenwolf , a strong creature who wanted to destroy the world , but why ? because he is a conqueror and loves to conquer planets , not because he wanted something nor revenge nor different pov nor anything , it's like he's a giant baby who asks his parents for a new toy , this 's the worst kind of villains for any story<br/><br/>i read many reviews of people talking about the bad effects and the mustache , while they should have been slamming the movie for its story !
they had an end of the world story , with 3 new characters and their origin stories and fears and traumas and every rivalry and comradery between them and on top of that a huge fan base , and yet they managed to make a story that couldn't fail , fail
it looked like a fake and cheap version of the avengers<br/><br/>this movie don't belong to the previous 2 zack snyder movies , you can love him or hate him but he tried to create something solid that maybe polarizing but solid , and of course joss wheadon can make good things but they couldn't work together
they couldn't find any director on earth to continue the movie other than the one who directed the avengers , that made the biggest fan feel that it will be an inferior movie to those of marvel unconsciously , they doomed it to failure from the start<br/><br/>i really tried to find anything good in this movie but failed miserably , one of the worst movies ever"

","Not much to be said about this film and it's critical and box office failures. Being hyped since years before it's released and with further expectations after the release of Wonder Wonder (which was great), Justice League doesn't deliver and feels forced, dull and just not worth the wait.<br/><br/>Weak and uninteresting plot and an unmotivated and forced villain. Some cheesy and off dialogue. The chemistry between the lead characters didn't seem right: Ben Affleck's Batman was dull, Superman (who isn't in it much) is a boring character, Wonder Woman was easily the highlight, Flash was awfully annoying, Aquaman was decent but wasted in screen presence, and Cyborg is a pointless character (we barely know much about him).<br/><br/>Overall this film didn't have a great tone, some decent action scenes but off looking CGI. After watching the film, didn't left disappointed since already knew about the criticism but as a fan this wasn't great or as entertaining as it should have been."

Again, The Flash worked out - but, RoboCop sucked and Stepenwolf was better left playing 'Magic Carpet Ride' in some Casino bar somewhere, because that whole storyline was ridiculous.

"Java_Joe","5","0","4","12 May 2019"," Unsurprisingly dull
","I don't know what it is about the DCEU, while they seem like they're on an upturn with a couple of the recent movies for the most part they're just that interesting. Of course all the issues that came with this production pretty much means that nothing good could really come of it.<br/><br/>Two directors, massive re-shoots that changed the plot halfway through. lousy special effects and a bloated budget pretty much meant that this would never make a profit.<br/><br/>Supposedly Zack Snyder was fired from the production halfway through and they brought in Joss Wheadon to continue. But that's just creating a mosaic of different styles and tones. You can tell where the Joss Wheadon bits are and where the Zack Snyder bits are. The tone is completely different which makes the movie feel disjointed and trying to tell two stories.<br/><br/>The FX ranged from good to absolutely terrible. Superman's upper lip? It looked awful considering they had to digitally remove his mustache. Now you'd figure a big FX company could do it but it made it look all weird. The worst part about it is that some amateurs on youtube actually managed to do it and make it look more natural. The main bad guy Steppenwolf? He looked like a cartoon. And I'm sorry but the Flash when he ran looked derpy as all hell. When the show on the CW actually does a better job of this you know your FX are messed up.<br/><br/>The characters ranged from good to bad. Henry Cavill as Superman is good. Gal Godot as Wonder Woman really works. Jason Momoa as Aquaman shows that he can be a badass character even if he's more dude bro than King of the Sea. And the new guy as Cyborg? Not bad. I'd like to see more of what he can do. But Affleck as Batman? I don't get it. He does a good Bruce Wayne which is one half of the character but as the dark knight he just feels wrong. And then there's the elephant in the room namely the guy that plays the Flash. What happened? They turned a light hearted character into a Jewish guy with Aspergers or something. But the running and the derpy look on his face I just couldn't take him seriously in the role.<br/><br/>And honestly they're trying to tell too much story all at once. While Marvel took their time to introduce all these characters DC just rushed the whole thing in a vain attempt to catch up. And that's all they've been doing is playing catch up ever since they started.<br/><br/>Supposedly there's a Zack Snyder workprint out there that I'd really like to see to see if it's an improvement over what we got. But I doubt it will ever see the light of day.<br/><br/>Hopefully DC has learned from their mistakes and will start pumping out the hits but I feel it's a little too late. We're nearing peak super hero saturation now. It won't be very long before people are just sick of it. With luck DC will make a couple more good movies before that happens."
"sahil-bakshi1","3","0","5","9 May 2019"," Wasted Potential
","You think this movie has some of greatest superhero characters i.e. Wonder woman, Aqua-man, Superman, Batman, Flash, Cyborg so this movie would be amazing but you are wrong. You couldn't make a worse movie having all these characters. I think this movie was made in hurry to tackle the Marvel Juggernaut. Audience doesn't get connected to all characters ( and playing actors) because you have not given the origin movies yet of all of them.
Superman got a hood ashwhooping in Batman vs Superman by the hands of Batman and Dooms' day So this movie tried to compensate it at the cost of naatural chemistry between characters. This movie shown that a team member (Superman) is above than the entire team, which was a very wrong message, and also kills the basic idea of formation of Justice league. The Superman wakes from death and beats the rest of the entire team?? Flash was just running away from him. Batman was just hanging like a useless ordinary human in the hands of superman. Cyborg and Aquaman were totally useless. Only wonderwoman tried to do something. In the Climax the only character I could see was Superman again. He was beating the main villain Steppenwolf with Wonder woman, meanwhile he was also saving people with Flash, Meanwhile he was also helping Cyborg with the Cube, Meanwhile he was also beating the goons of Steppenwolf with batman. Actually this was a Superman movie, which featured some other characters as well.<br/><br/>The only thing the Great Flash did in this movie was to- push a jammed car. That was his role. Thats it.<br/><br/>DC, Learn something from Marvel."

It's no surprise since DCEU didn't even try to build-up their characters and manage to be worst than BvS.<br/><br/>The jokes in the movie felt force, we only know 2 characters with development, the visual effects and colors is bland as hell like I'm looking at a PS4 graphics if it was downgraded.

"CinematicGarbage","1","0","7","1 May 2019"," Just...normal!
","Justice League (2017) is the fifth installment of the DC Extended Universe. Just like the Avengers from the MCU, Justice League is a movie of superheroes form into a team just like singers and artists form into a musical band. There's not much to say about the movie.
You already know the casts: Ben Affleck as Batman, Henry Cavill as Superman, Ezra Miller as The Flash, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Jason Momoa as Aquaman, Ray Fisher as Cyborg and Ciaran Hinds as Steppenwolf. I am fine with the acting. There's nothing special or unique about it. It might get a 7.4/10 from me.
The plot is not okay. It's just about forming a band but with just few risks. I am not that fine with it. Maybe a 6.8/10.
The action scenes are kinda Epic and sometimes they can be forgettable. The most popular fight in the movie is not the final battle, but when Superman fought with the Justice League (I saw people uploaded many of this on Youtube). The CGI effects are quite good but if this is a good superhero movie, I suggest black bars should be added like other superhero team movies like Avengers: Age of Ultron. An 8.2/10 from me. Everything is HD.
I really like the reference when Flash mentioned Pet Sematary (where the dead comes back to life by Stephen King) when they're talking about bringing Superman back alive.
The characters are fine and powerful. The supervillain Steppenwolf is not too evil but strong and I like how they made the motherboxes. I would give the characters 7.1/10. They're just okay, I am fine.
I'm just concerned that the screenplay should be better bacause many scenes should need a much much better sentence. Could be a 6.7/10. I like the humor in here. I do laugh a few times and I was really entertained.
The ending is good. Superheroes not only Superman but others become famous and take pictures with kids. Not bad at all. An 8/10.
I told you, there's not much to say about the movie. Many things are normal about it. There's not much special about the movie but it always shows us how members form into a band or a team or even a club.<br/><br/>Points: 7.25/10"

And then they went back during reshoots with Joss Whedon & butchered his & Zack Snyder's original vision, desecrating the original cut & adding offensively obvious, cheap-looking additional bits to it until the film became an embodiment of Frankenstein's Monster, totally ruining what was supposed to have been a landmark achievement in his career..."

","While it can be difficult to separate comparisons of DC's Justice League (2017) with Marvel's The Avengers (2010), there are plenty of parallels and similarities between the two. That's not to say this is a bad thing, as fans of comic book heroes will always love to see their favorite characters team up to take on evil forces almost as much as they want to see these bastions of justice duke it out. Justice League certainly delivers on this, but in a way that felt uninteresting and lacking the serious consequences to the world at large.<br/><br/>Concerning the characters themselves, Justice League succeeds in creating a unique team with some interesting heroes. Wonder Woman's (Gal Gadot) success in her standalone film could be seen in one of the first (and possibly best) sequences of the film. Additionally, The Flash (Ezra Miller) was a constant source of entertainment as the comic relief. Most importantly, Justice League succeeded in making Aquaman (Jason Momoa) an absolute badass. And while there have been plenty of films with Batman (Ben Affleck), this version certainly seems to draw from its ""detective comics"" roots to significant effect.<br/><br/>I do find it somewhat ironic/fitting that Zach Snyder directed this penultimate collection of superheroes from the DC universe, especially considering he directed the darker DC superhero film, Watchmen (2009) early on in his career. Plenty of his style remains in this film, but the impact of the plot seems to be a miss here. I think this is mostly because the main antagonist doesn't easily trace back to one of the known entities in the series: mainly Wonder Woman (2017), Batman v. Superman (2016), and Man of Steel (2013). At least in The Avengers, audiences had already met Loki in Thor (2010). I'm a little disappointed there wasn't more Steppenwolf music as part of the soundtrack, though.<br/><br/>A procedural gathering of superheroes, I give Justice League 3.5 stars out of 5."
"annakohl","6","0","13","6 March 2019"," Most disappointing superhero film
","The movie started off on a decent note but it was shaky from the start. It was clear that Batman was facing an internal battle with himself after leading Superman to die. He felt that Superman was the only person who could save the world from the upcoming threat to humanity but since Batman lead him to his demise it's his fault if the world perishes. My hope was that they would find a way to defeat the enemy by joining together and proving they don't need to rely on one man to save them all but that they can find the strength to over come this challenge without Superman. This moral dilemma might've been the only interesting thing in the entire movie. Unfortunately, the justice league resorted to reviving Superman despite the fact that there was a chance he might not be the same. This just shows that the justice league can not overcome their enemy without Superman and that this team is actually only a one man show. Bringing Superman to life was also a reckless decision since he is a ridiculously powerful being that could've harmed lots of people if his mindset wasn't the same after being brought back. Superman is a character that should've stayed dead due to the fact that he isnt relatable and overall too powerful. He has no character flaws (or at least none that are obvious enough to matter) and that makes him too strong. He is what an ideal superhero would be but his strength prevents the plot from having any real suspense. You can always expect him to make the right decision and this can become boring. Having kryptonite as a weakness isn't redeeming either because it's extremely hard to obtain and most of the time it only takes away his abilities. In the end, Superman was brought back to life in the justice league and ruined the movie that had already been going downhill from the start. Superman's lines were cheesy and cringy as soon as he was brought back. Bringing Superman back also ruined any possible tension in the plot because the audience lost any fear of something going wrong with the most ridiculously overpowered character back in the spotlight. I would have very much so liked to have seen Batman learn that he can overcome the challenge without Superman but now it leaves the audience wondering if the justice league can accomplish anything at all. The next problem with the justice league movie is the fact that the villain is boring. Villains like Thanos and Bane are better because they actually have goals that match ones of real life villains. The villain, Steppenwolf, in the justice league movie just wanted to destroy everything which is totally cliche and ridiculous. The idea that a villain needs to be completely evil is totally outdated. Villains should have ideals of realistic ""villains"" and should have goals that make sense. That's what makes Thanos a better villain. His ideas about getting rid of half the universe to save the other half from future destruction it a mindset real life people actually have. What realistic being would want to destroy everything? What is to be gained? Absolutely nothing would be the right answer. Steppenwolf only wanted to destroy everything which is the most pointless and ridiculous goal of any living thing alive. The justice league movie was also put together too quickly. Not enough character building was done to make anyone care about some of the supposed main characters. Seeing a movie about Flash first would've made his appearance much more meaningful and the possibility of harm being done to him much more worrisome. Unfortunately (in a scramble to copy the avengers movies) the justice league movie lacks this. Even the characters who have starred in other films came off as boring, especially Superman and Batman, their characters were dull and their personalities not entertaining enough. DC needs to slow down and stop trying to race with the marvel cinematic universe because marvel has a start and pace that DC can't seem to keep up with."

","Deus ex machina seems to be what they are teaching in writing classes because the writers in Hollywood seem to use it an awful lot in movies.

It has been a long time since it came out but i will review it anyways cause why not.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
All the characters have almost no personality.
Batman has no personality, Wonder Woman has no personality, Aquaman has some personality, Cyborg has the least personality, And Superman has no personality.
The Flash has the most personality but he is just annoying.
They should have just made a solo film of all these characters instead of having a bunch of undeveloped characters.
How could they not think that this is a bad idea.
1. The director of the movie had to leave cause of some personal issues so the new director needs to make the movie instead.
2. The new director reshoots most of the scenes cause he felt like the scenes weren't good enough to show to the audience.
3. The director needs to develop 3 characters in 1 movie.
4. Cause Warner bros are a bunch of idiots, The director needs to cut most of the movies scenes so that the movie could be only 2 hours long.
This movie is a mess.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
Steppenwolf is really really bad he has no development he has 0 personality and has really weak motivation.<br/><br/>SUPERMAN
The revival of Superman was a mess.
It felt like a chore that had to be done to please the DC fans.
And its not really a spoiler cause they said that Henry cavill would be in Justice league.
And it obviously shows that they don't really care about the DCEU they are just doing it for the money.
They could have had Superman dead make a bunch of solo films where they develop all the Justice league characters and then when Justice league comes out then they could revive superman but they cant just revive him any how.
But sadly Warner bros revived Superman any how.
They fought Superman and then Louis lane came and then everything was fine.
That's the biggest Deus ex machina i have ever seen in a movie.
I never thought that Superman and Louis lane where a good couple in the DCEU movies and now to make us believe that Superman and Louis lane are such a good couple that love can solve Superman's evilness when he gets revived it just blows my mind.
Superman feels like an unnecessary character and that's shocking cause Superman should be the most important character in the movie.<br/><br/>ACTION
The action is bad its so uninspired.
They really thought of the most basic way to make an action scene.
Infinity war a good movie the action scene there was amazing many different fighting styles many cool moments i don't need to say more about the fighting.
But Justice league its the opposite.<br/><br/>VERDICT 
If you haven't watched justice league don't watch it just ignore it and watch a better movie instead."
"hamletrocks69-3-163288","3","0","3","15 October 2018"," Great Batman in a wrong movie
","Justice League - First let me get one thing off before the review of the movie. I am a huge Batman fan. There was always the question, after Christian Bale who and Ben Affleck was a fitting replacement but unfortunately did not have a fitting script or director to match. Even in this movie he is just like a brooding boyfriend who lost his best friend and the guilt of what happened in B vs S and with the only superpower he wields in this is that he is rich. What a let down for one of the coolest superheroes in comics.
Wonder Woman - Still the best in the franchise and always wonderful to watch onscreen, fights n all.
Flash - Good but a bit goofy provides the laughs we 'll see more character build up in the solo movie best year.
Cyborg- Just in the movie to kick start machines that's all major scenes were cut out of the movie 
Aquaman - Jason Mamoa looks good again short but will have to wait for his solo outing next year.
Superman - Well he is back no spoiler here does what he does good to see him back. Wished he wore the black suit and had a darker character as the comics.
The villain is the weakest here who is a CGI mess and just does not create that villiany required for such a genre and just does not connect.
As for the movie what can we say about it when it changed directors in between, the final product cut by 59 mins and tries to be funny a la Marvel and removing all the character build ups, It just does not meet expectations. DC comics are dark and should stay so in the movies too, look at what Nolan did to the Batman series. We need something like that but the only positive is the team is together with scope for more additions and hope to see a better outing once some of their solo movies come out in the coming years.
Catch Thor Ragnarok instead and have a good time at the movies."
"Noah_Biondi","4","0","2","15 October 2018"," Injustice League
","Justice League is the superhero movie equivalent of a football team trying to overcome their mistakes and show off their muscles, even though they are stained by their poor development. In other words, it's a movie with a team that tries so hard to be good, but ends up failing miserably.<br/><br/>The story? Fueled by his restored faith in humanity, and inspired by Superman's selfless act, Bruce Wayne enlists newfound ally Diana Prince to face an even greater threat. Together, Batman and Wonder Woman work quickly to recruit a team to stand against this newly-awakened enemy. Despite the formation of an unprecedented league of heroes in Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Cyborg and the Flash, it may be too late to save the planet from an assault of catastrophic proportions.<br/><br/>What the film has going against it is that there has only been a couple of prior films to set up this movie, including Man of Steel, Batman vs. Superman, and Wonder Woman. The problem with Batman vs. Superman is that they jumped right into the crossovers without properly setting up Batman, and same applies to this movie. Batman, Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash haven't gotten their own origin stories yet, and even if they will have some in the future, this is right now, and we don't know their stories in film. Because of this, it fails to feel like a big and popular event in cinema history, unlike in The Avengers, where the origin stories have already been set up for a big cinematic crossover to happen, proving that Marvel is capable of setting up their cinematic universe before going into the big crossovers. DC, on the other hand, makes their movies solely for the profit, caring little about the quality and more on the gross, and because there were no prior setups from this film, it wasn't the huge hit DC hoped it would be. Of course, the biggest problem with this movie is its runtime of only 2 hours, while the average Avengers movie is in the 2 hours and 20 minutes mark. If this is the ultimate cinematic dawn of the Justice League, then why is it so short? Does DC know audiences have a low attention span for their films?<br/><br/>Justice League, in conclusion, is a mess of a superhero film with a rushed focus on going into the big action and caring little about the storyline or the character development, and when we do get into the action, the visual effects are poor and the excitement is kept to a low. Not all superhero franchises can be like Marvel, and DC definitely proves this statement true."

","There's little going for this film, taking into account the behind the scenes issues and staff changes such occupancies obviously had massive effects upon the final product. For a big budget blockbuster it looks slightly cheap and obviously staged which is poor plus there's subtle moments which just seem off and show technical incompetence from camera crews and other creatives which is as I said earlier poor for such a category of film. One of the more harsher criticisms is the style/tonal outcome of the film, the Two listed directors have opposing styles with differences in focus too with Snyder having an eye for spectacle and Whedon a craft for story the final mesh is a jumble of poor content that's flung together and ultimately is uninteresting. Characters are shallow even the DCEU's shining star Wonder Woman (Gadot) is reduced to mostly low angled shots from her rear and it's a stretch to say her outing this time has any redeeming factors, Aquaman and the Flash give you some comic relief but frankly are forgettable, Cyborg is hardly present for the majority of the runtime and the two most iconic figures in the history of comics/popular entertainment Batman and Superman seem uncompelling and somewhat phoned in and is probably the reason for the general mediocre response to the film. The story arcs are mostly irrelevant and unoriginal with zero charm to them which brings down the quality even further. The villain is a giant CGI snail essentially with no characteristics to suggest a match for the protagonists which is supported by earlier developments which depict his defeat and struggles in battle with other societies/worlds within this universe. There's attempts at fixing the universes problems but ultimately it seems as though this ship has well and truly sunk. With an all star cast and such a significant event on the current DC filmography it's worth a watch to bring you up to speed but otherwise avoid"

"X-marxTheSpOt","3","0","3","20 August 2018"," D.C. does no justice to the league
","For starters I honestly wasnt expecting much from this movie except a few decent action sequences. Well, that's about all this movie ever offers. The best part of the movie was the Amazon's trying to fight off Steppenwolf. 99% of the movie was made of terribly noticeable cgi. Obviously practical effects couldn't be used for everything but its just done so badly here. Steppenwolf looks like a laughable Minotaur goat creature. Cyborg looked just as laughable with way more cgi than was needed. They should have just named it justice CGI at least we all know what that is. All the superhero costumes look good but thats it. Acting was mediocre at best. Even Ben Affleck seemed bored as Batman. Henry caville as superman was awful. His facial expressions alone say it all. It really made me feel like no one actually tried in this film. Since superman, Batman and wonder woman already have a backstory it would only make sense to focus on the flash aquaman and cyborg. Instead what we get is about 1 minute of the flash. 5 minutes of aquaman.(way too much for the cringe worthy Jason momoa portrayal) and way more time on cyborg for whatever reason. None of them are likeable here. I liked them better in comic form. Maybe d.c. should take some ques from marvel in the future to learn how to write better characters and story arcs. Sorry, but d.c. universe deserves so much better than this. I have no desire to see a sequel even tho we all know there is going to be one. I should have took warning from dawn of justice and stayed far away from this movie. Its not even worth the mind numbing blockbuster summer movie action because there isn't any!"

","Any super hero movie needs 3 things - a good script/story, good acting, and great CGI. This movie had none of these things. The only actor that did a decent job was Ezra Miller as The Flash, all the others were truly horrible and stiff. The story was lame and the attempts at humor fell flat 90% of the time. The scenes did not flow, no continuity. Finally, the CGI was by far the worst of any hero movie I've seen in years. The bad guy, Steppenwolf, looked like stepped right out of a video game. I give it a rating of 4/10 solely on the better action scenes. I am baffled how Marvel can do these films so well and DC so poorly."
"jidhun","4","0","3","12 August 2018"," Just disappointed
","Comic fan or not I think most people agree this movie wasn't the best. For those who like comics, it's a bit offensive to our favourite heroes and for film fans, it's just a boring time.<br/><br/>The entire experience felt rushed, almost as if someone was trying to catch up with another cinematic universe. Wonder woman had some prior development due to her film but at this point, Batman, Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman have no real character besides what they tell us in this one movie and it just makes it a bit of a trainwreck.
Visually it wasn't that impressive, the villain looks like a PS2 era boss, cyborg looks like he's still in a closed beta, and *that moustache*. Nothing really left me impressed. 
From what I can tell this movie mostly does adapt one specific comic (which I will leave out for the sake of spoilers) but both that comic and it's animated counterpart told the story far better while still having some fun with the characters. 
Overall, this certainly isn't the worst movie in the DC cinematic universe but it isn't the best either. Hopefully this is just a small stumble while they're still attempting to establish their individual identity and the movies inevitably coming out in the coming years will bring heroes to the silver screen in a far more faithful manner."

","Maybe this is just a personal opinion, but every dc film (dceu) after the dark knight trilogy has just been a flop.
Besides my personal opinion, this film had no memorable moments, the cgi was horrible when it should have been great considering it is one of the highest budget films ever made. The characters introductions were rushed so there was no character connections with eachother, no one had a good relationship with anyone, hey all just seemed to 'know eachother' not have an actual relationship. This film seemed like the hero version of suicide squad, exactly the same with an introduction to every character. The introductions didn't really give us much information either. Let's take marvel for example, they had many films leading up to the first avengers film, so we would have time to form our opinions on certain characters which is the way films like justice league and avengers should be.
I can't believe i'm saying this but I actually preferred Suicide Squad which shows how bad this film was.
It wasn't the worst film ever but it certainly wasn't a good one."
"stevenrodz","7","0","2","10 August 2018"," Screwed by the moustache and the run ...bigtime!
","Yup. This movie is Superman-centric and should've been a treat to watch for all Superman and DC fans but instead turns out to be excruciating due to none other than the cringe-worthy CGI on Henry Cavill's face! For what is Henry's most iconic role in his career history, DC and Superman screwed up by trying to hide a moustache with CGI than putting one for the other film he was keeping it for! Simply moronic on the part of both leading to fan dismay of epic proportions.<br/><br/>The film is ""dark"" as are all DC films which should'nt be taken as a positive thing by the studios. They did include deliberate humour in this one and the unexpected one with another huge CGi blunder in Flash's paralytic run. All DC heroes play their part and there's not much to complain on the action scenes which are sequenced well. <br/><br/>Gal Gadot is pure-grade eyecandy as usual. Jason Momoa is a very convincing Aquaman. Nobody plays an incompetent aging Batman than Ben Affleck. Ezra Miller and Ray Fisher do their bit as supporting cast. Amy Adams as Lois Lane needs to be replaced for being less than mediocre. The dumb-foolery continued with a complete CGi villain Steppenwolf who looks fit for a low-budget horror film than a $300 million budget DC movie.<br/><br/>The saving grace for most DC fans is in the accurate depiction of Superman's unmatchable strength and superpowers compared to the rest of the justice league and the villains. This is superbly demonstrated in both Superman's resurrected confusion and the climax where he makes his presence pretty strong. <br/><br/>Ben needs to be replaced as Batman. Maybe a fitter and more skilled Scott Adkins could fit in as Batman to match Henry's stature. Henry and Zack could've done a hell lot better when planning this one. Probably nowhere in movie history has a moustache been such a letdown."

I find I'm never invested in these movies. There's too much going on, it's too busy, the special effects take precedent over storyline, I'm so done.

","Justice League (2017)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>After the death of Superman (Henry Cavill), Batman (Ben Affleck) decides to get a superteam together because a strong enemy could be trying to end the world. With the help of Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) the Justice League goes out to defeat Steppenwolf but a moral question regarding Superman creeps up.<br/><br/>It seems that in today's comic book movie world one must constantly compare the two rivals. That of course being DC and Marvel but I think we're at the point where that just needs to stop. Sure, fans have their favorites but comparing the two is just rather pointless to me but then again I'm not really a comic book fan. With that said, I'm also not a huge fan of Zack Snyder but I must say that I found JUSTICE LEAGUE to be an entertaining movie. Even though it falls well short of being a classic or even one of the better comic book movies out there.<br/><br/>I think the best part of the film is the fact that the superheroes themselves are so good and entertaining. It does seem that Batman's role in the film was taken down a bit and this might be due to how successful WONDER WOMAN was at the box office. She's certainly front and center here and there's no question that's not a bad thing. I also thought the addition of Aquaman was great as Momoa was excellent in the role and it was great whenever he was on the screen. I also thought The Flash was put to a good start here, although it seems they were taking the more ""dork"" approach like Spider-Man was in the AVENGERS movie. I wasn't the biggest fan of Cyborg here as he was the least interesting of all the heroes.<br/><br/>Snyder's direction was actually quite good here but I guess there's some controversy over him walking away from the project and it being finished by Joss Whedeon. I don't know all the details of who shot what or who made what decisions but I thought the flow of the movie was quite good. I also thought the CGI world was good for what it was and especially the battle scene at the end, which was a lot of fun. The performances were good by the entire cast as there's no question that everyone is fitting into their roles nicely. I'm still not sure what's up with the voice of Batman but that's another topic.<br/><br/>JUSTICE LEAGUE, as I said, has some flaws including it getting off to a rather slow start. I'd also argue that the film could have used a tad bit more excitement but at the same time I think it delivered enough to where fans should be entertained."

If it wasn't for Wonder Woman, this would be a score of a 1.<br/><br/>The Batman from the Dark Knight 3-movie series was the best representation of the role. Cavill can stay as Superman. Please stop trying to make Barry Allen (Flash) into a joke. Aquaman is a ""King"" that exudes an arrogance, but a strength from the duality of both his worlds. Keep Lois Lane out of the movie... Ugh!

But apart from it's epileptic colour and light scenes, the story and characters were a little off. Superman was dead. I was so disappointed. Superman doesn't die, he's immortal. Then he was buried in a coffin making him less than what he was. Bringing him back from the dead was quite weird. I had hoped he wasn't even in the coffin or atleast be alive to just open his eyes and burst out anyway. I didn't warm to the scene of Superman and Luis Lane, especially Luis as she came across as a dull character, without any expression or emotions. Batman character was too jolly, silly and colourful to be Batman. This wasn't Batman, it had to be an imposter. I found that the Cyborg didn't act like one and seemed too cheerful and smiley to be an android. Wonder Woman was brilliant although the comment by Aquaman ""Are you okay?"" was a bit naff and inappropriate. She's an Amazon and trained to be tough and get direct blows, she's not a little girl! They made the Flash into a clown. The scene that took place thousands of years ago when there was a huge war against Steppenwolf was both awesome and magical. However, the present Steppenwolf is a lot weaker now as only a few of the superheroes were up against him, and he got swarmed by the parademons. This film had some silly moments but quite chunky in action and fantasy effects."

","Every time I am disappointed by a Marvel movie, I watch a DC movie to remind myself just how much worse it could have been. Justice League: Dawn of the League of Justice is a case in point. If you're looking for great scriptwriting and good quality CGI, you won't find it here. DC really is the bargain bin of superhero movies.<br/><br/>Superman is dead, having succumbed to the fatal wounds he received from critical reviews of Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Wonder Woman is sad, because Superman used to be her boyfriend.<br/><br/>Batman (the useless character nobody even wanted) is forced to admit-twice in this movie!-that he has no superpowers whatsoever, which completely discredits his ludicrous claim to be a superhero.<br/><br/>MerMan is a raging alcoholic whose general attitude towards life can be summarised as 'Fuck the lot of you' (I really liked this guy!) The Dash is a moody autistic kid with ADHD.<br/><br/>Victor Doom is now a black man (for some strange reason?!) and somewhere along the line he's traded in his hooded cape for a boring hoodie that looks like it was stolen from Walmart. His powers also seem to be very different from what I remember, but perhaps that's just me.<br/><br/>Together they face Steppenwolf, who is arguably the most interesting and relatable character in the entire DC universe aside from Blackheart. (When are we going to get Steppenwolf Vs. MerMan? I'd watch the hell out of that!)<br/><br/>Somewhere along the line, Steppenwolf has lost his three magical Rubik's Cubes, which will allow him to destroy the universe if he can just find the bloody things and stick them back together. Batman says this would be a very bad thing, and wants to stop Steppenwolf himself, but can't because he's not a real superhero. Wonder Woman is sad, because Batman used to be her boyfriend.<br/><br/>Anyway, the various superheroes do their thing in predictable fashion, and for the most part it's an absolute cringefest.<br/><br/>Batman wants to resurrect Superman using magic Krytponite goo and some other stuff that is never clearly explained. The Dash agrees to stop Steppenwolf as long as it doesn't involve fighting, saving people, or exerting himself in any way at all. Wonder Woman is sad, because that guy from the other movie used to be her boyfriend. Victor Doom is having some kind of existential crisis. MerMan literally has no fucks to give.<br/><br/>A special mention goes to Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Jeremy Irons, and CiarÃ¡n Hinds, who all worked hard to salvage this hot mess from the dumpster fire it so richly deserves to die in. I thoroughly enjoyed their performances. Everyone else can bite a grenade.<br/><br/>I rate Justice League: Dawn of the League of Justice at 16.65 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a paint-by-numbers 5/10 on IMDB."

I think we've reached a point in film making where the storytelling and acting just cannot keep up with the amazing VFX and that's why you see all the disappointment with this movie experience, and why people are saying so much of it is laughable - there's an imbalance that's going to take a film genius to correct."

"missaretha","6","0","1","8 July 2018"," Picked The Wrong Lead Superhero
","With three overwhelmingly successful Batman movies starring Christian Bale, and with countless attempts to unsuccessfully reboot Superman, and a finally successful reboot of superman with Henry Caville, they picked the wrong superhero to lead these movies. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck knows nothing about playing Batman except to try and imitate the gruff voice of Christian Bale, which was electronically modified anyway. As soon as Man Of Steel became a hit, they should have stayed focused on Superman and Lois Lane and then they should have introduced all of the characters of the Justice League so that we would know who they are in the ensemble movie. <br/><br/>These people need to take a huge look at Marvel and pretty much copy what they're doing. Because they're doing it the right way. <br/><br/>Very little screen time for Superman and Lois Lane made this really boring. The villain sucked. It was bad character, bad dialogue, and bad effects. It simply all fell flat. The only real salvation for this movie is Jason Momoa as Aquaman and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. And, they still fell short. Most likely because they were working with bad material."

"rushmoras","7","0","2","3 June 2018"," It's not that bad as everyone says it is, but compared to Marvel's Avangers, it does lack something
","It is not that bad as many comic-book lovers out there say it is bad, but compared to Marvel's Avengers it does seem that this movie falls short. The main things that I did not like:<br/><br/>1. The main villain. After the visions that Bruce Waine had in Batman versus Superman, I really thought that the main villain for this movie will be Darkseid. However, this was not the case. Because I never read any comic book in my life and only know main protagonists/antagonists from the animated series that I've watched as a kid those many years ago, I honestly did not know who or what Stephenwolf is. Sure, the way he was portrayed it looked like he was capable of doing damage (and he did for most of the movie), but in the end his capabilities fell short.
2. The ressurection of Superman. Now, the whole premise of Justice League was that Batman and Wonder Woman wanted to build a team to fight even bigger foes than Doomsday, because Superman is dead. That's why they were looking for meta-humans for their crusade. Stephenwolf did not much care for those heroes in any way, to him, they were just nuisance. The only one who could go toe-to-toe with stephenwolf was Diana, and that was because as Stephenwolf said she had blood of the old gods flowing through her veins (and it took an army of humans, aliens and gods to defeat Stephenwolf thousands of years ago). And even then Diana had trouble containing him. Enter Superman. One two - and Stephenwolf's out of the game (well, because his scythe was destroyed, so he lost his influence over his minions and they exacted their revenge against him). Thus why I said in first paragraph, that the villain's capabilities felt short, due to Superman. 
3. The premise. As I've mentioned in the second paragraph, Batman and Wonder Woman gathered a team, because Superman was nowhere to be found. And yet, since they resurrected him (and Superman had the time to save civilians prior to engaging in a fist fight against Stephenwolf), they don't really need Justice League anymore, because Superman is essentially Justice League - a one man army. All of the other would be future heroes and current heroes are ants compared to him (even Diana). Let's face it, there should be no Justice League. I mean, if Batman and Co. prior to Superman's arrival had trouble with Stephenwolf and his demons, what are they going to do against Darkseid, which is essentially Stephenwolf's boss? Throw shoes at him? Ofcourse, Superman is going to do most of the job there as well.
4. The introduction of characters. This in essence I think were DCU had gone wrong. The only characters that they've established was Superman (in Man of Steel) and Wonder Woman (well, in Wonder Woman). All of the other characters, yes, even the newly portrayed Affleck's Batman, was never established with a separate prior movie. They are doing things backwards. First, they introduce a team of heroes, and then they are making movies about their origins/heroic deeds. That can't possibly wok for the major audience, because I bet that the average movie goer only knows Batman and Superman. He does not know who Aquaman is, or who the Flash is (if they do not watch Arrowerse's Flash), so they can't relate to a character at all. Nope, firstly, DC should establish independent lore of their characters and then group them in to a team like Marvel has done. This way, the build-up seems to be more earned. 
While I only mentioned the negatives (because they are easier to write), but I liked this movie. It was not that bad as many portrayed it to be. But, it really lacks something. And the only major highlight of this movie was when Superman fought the JL members, because they interrupted his rest in peace slumber (which again, just proves my point, you don't need any JL, because Sups in Snyder's reality is JL). <br/><br/>6.5/10 (7/10)."

","In marvels avengers black widow, black panther, captain america who ain´t at the same strength level as thor or hulk can still fight the main villains and still be useful even though they still can get stomped, most characters are nerfed compared to the comics. <br/><br/>Batman on the other hand seems really, really weak here because they got characters like superman, wonder woman who are and the villain so strong that he can´t do anything. They need to nerf the characters to make Batman more useful since he is a really popular character.<br/><br/>The problems I had with this movie is:
1) The forced jokes, DC have always been darker in the movies compared to Marvel and in this movie they made a lot of jokes that seemed forced and were not funny at all.
2) If you have seen the first Deadpool movie where he said something like that they had a budged so they only could have 2 x-men in the movie. I had that same feeling when they showed 1 family in danger the whole movie.
3) The villain was boring and had no character at all, the fight where they fought superman was better than the ending fight."

Glossy, action-packed,cheesy one liners and a stoïc Ben Affleck didn't do it enough for me.

","The rival between marvel and DC has been well fought for many years in the comic world. When it comes to films, let's just face the hard nosed facts Marvel slaughters the DC world. Regardless of whether ANY critic justifiably liked the film, most will run down all it's faults. Taking place after the death of Superman in ""BATMAN VS SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE"", it follows the sense of honor Batman/Bruce Wayne has for doing what is right in the world. He knows he cannot fight the good fight alone and goes after more heroes like him to form a team. There is a solid introduction to Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg, and we already know Wonder Woman. <br/><br/>The villain or darkside of things is Steppenwolf, whom we don't get a lot of filler of his backstory, just bits and pieces.

"classicsoncall","7","0","1","17 April 2018"," ""You lunatics better know what you're doing.""
","I waited to catch this movie on DVD because I'm kind of tired being disappointed by DC super-hero films in the theater. If one considers this story as a sequel to 'Dawn of Justice', then it works well enough to bring Superman (Henry Cavill) back from the dead, but that's about it. The plot is oh, so familiar, in that we have three missing 'mother boxes' that need to be reunited to form the 'Unity', an apocalyptic power that can destroy worlds and transform them into primordial hell-scapes. How many times have we been exposed to that kind of scenario? The master villain this time is a character with the not so original name of Steppenwolf, and for folks like myself who've been around a while, that only brings back memories of a Magic Carpet Ride. <br/><br/>This might actually be the most comic-bookish movie I've yet seen, as most of the action sequences looked like the panels of a comic strip. Most notable as an example would be any of those featuring Barry Allen's Flash whenever he got up to warp speed. Speaking of which, I thought Ezra Miller was too young to be portraying a DC hero along side such stalwarts as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. These were my Silver Age icons back in the Fifties and early Sixties, so I couldn't relate to his character here as part of the Justice League. Jason Momoa brought an unexpected regal bearing to the person of Aquaman/Arthur Curry, while Cyborg (Ray Fisher) I couldn't relate to at any level as he wasn't part of my comic book past. So my biggest question about establishing this first installment of the super hero club was 'Where's Green Lantern'? I thought that was a big mistake and a major unforced error.<br/><br/>But of course, the finale sets us up for the sequel with Batman (Ben Affleck), or I should say, Bruce Wayne, using his wealth to buy a huge building for the Justice League headquarters. There was a hint of new members, so it would have been cool if the after-credits scenes offered a glimpse of additional super-heroes, but the most we got was the tease of a Superman/Flash race and a potential team up between Luthor and Deathstroke. What I'd really like to see in future DC based stories is some of the humor that the Marvel folks manage to incorporate into their pictures, most notably the recent ""Thor: Ragnarok"". I think the DC heroes would be better served by not having the writers take things so seriously."

","After how depressing DC movies proved, I had given up until Wonder Woman made me hope again. I was still scared to try JL but found it quite pleasant. 
I liked the overall story and character interactions. I appreciate the attempt to get out of Snyder's shadow (literally). I like the fantasy appeal of three races being given 3 parts of a whole to keep evil at bay and that then getting forgotten through the years, and evil's return bringing the races back together. <br/><br/>However, the characters don't always act like themselves. Batman doesn't always feel like Batman. Flash being scared when people are in danger? I like Ezra's portrayal, as he is trying to understand someone who exists in super-speed evidenced by his conversations and trying out a new running style. Except the latter defeats the purpose? The Flash isn't fast because he runs a certain way. He could stand still and vibrate his body at super-speed without doing any weird contortions. Usually it's interesting when the Flash runs, but now its just cringe-worthy. Also Cyborg seems like the deux-ex-machina for every situation.<br/><br/>Apart from that there are obvious problems from changing directors and tone and how the movie flows. I also felt the three mother-boxes weren't being all that well protected. So Steppenwolf can simply teleport to them with his armies, but the Amazons only had a bunch of warriors around to protect it? <br/><br/>Despite the flaws, I must say the positives still shine through to earn a higher rating than the flaws would permit. The WW bank scene had the same level of epicness from the WW movie and who can Not be impressed by Superman's eye moving in super-speed? Superman's portrayal also feels a lot more closer to what he is and stands for this time. The overall story has its appeal (which to me, is the most important point of a movie) and heart, and that combined with several good moments makes this a movie I would revisit often."

","After DC finally had a winner in 'Wonder Woman', there were hopes 'Justice League' would continue the momentum.<br/><br/>It's doesn't.<br/><br/>While JL isn't as awful as 'Suicide Squad' and not as messy as 'Batman v Superman' (or messy enough to need a director's cut to fill the plot holes) it still feels rushed and ill-formed, a legacy of DC's impatience in building their Extended Universe.<br/><br/>The plot is basic: Steppenwolf needs to unite three Mother Boxes (one in Atlantis, once in Themiscyria and one on Earth) so he can take over the world or something. It feels like it's been done a million times and doesn't create a lot of tension.<br/><br/>The problem with 'Justice League' is cramming together six heroes (including Superman's eventual return) in a two-hour movie. Yes, Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman are established, but Cyborg, Flash and Aquaman are properly introduced in the DCEU through 'Justice League'. Their backstories are minimal before they're thrown in the action; though Aquaman gets a solo film later this year, it seems a bit late.<br/><br/>The handover from Zack Snyder to Joss Whedon shows, with a lot more humour in 'Justice League.' The comic relief work lands on the Flash, who plays the ""I'm just a kid and I don't really have control of my powers yet, but this is so cool"" shtick. The banter between Alfred and Batman/Bruce Wayne is again a standout, including a callback to 'Batman Returns.'<br/><br/>Superman's returns feels rushed, brought back out of necessity and his CGI-ed non-moustache (a scheduling conflict meant Henry Cavill couldn't shave his moustache) is very distracting. It's not a patch on the Return of Superman graphic novel, with four Supermen emerging before the real Superman's triumphant return.<br/><br/>It's a shame this originally planned two-parter didn't happen, as the first film could've been used to establish the characters and set the stakes for part two.

","""Justice League"" is an okay DCEU film.<br/><br/>Part of me enjoyed it, but part of me didn't.<br/><br/>I think a big part of this film is that it just feels like it's not complete. My biggest worry going into it was:
""Oh no, they've got to introduced three new characters, a new villain, revive Superman, beat a villain, and be a good movie - all at once.""<br/><br/>Fortunately, the introduction of the The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg were all great. They didn't feel forced, they weren't introductions like ""Suicide Squad,"" they were great. Along with that, the interactions between the characters of the Justice League worked really well also.<br/><br/>There was more comedy in this film, much like ""Suicide Squad,"" except this was actually funny.<br/><br/>The thing I didn't enjoy as much was the plot. Steppenwolf wasn't an awful villain, he just wasn't a major villain. Considering the fact that the film was supposed to setup Darkseid and actually use him as the main villain, you can kind of see what we're missing here.<br/><br/>And it's kind of unfortunate. After the great film that was ""Wonder Woman,"" we were all expecting a great ""Justice League."" Instead, it was just okay.<br/><br/>At least it's not nearly as bad as Suicide Squad."

I cannot stand the actor or the character he portrays It's just to much forced humor that doesn't work and the ""racial"" comment that comes out of the blue during a conversation with Cyborrg just makes me roll my eyes.<br/><br/>The visual effects are lacking at times as well. Superman just looks weird and I know that this was related to the actor not being willing to shave of the mustache he grew for another movie. His face just looks off in this movie.<br/><br/>The story is average. There is not really to much happening. For me the only character that interests me more now is Aquaman.

","The good:<br/><br/>Likable characters! I liked the internaction and chemistry between the heroes. Batman was brooding and cynical, but played off the waterman and Supergirl quite well. Supergirl was the voice of reason it seems, the more mature one in a boys club. She felt like a mother of the others, sort of.
The red guy seemed to be the comedian of the group. Similar to the running guy in the Marvel movies, he was mostly just situationally funny. <br/><br/>The bad:
It was a regular bad guy story. And the bad guy wasnt all that impressive. Usually such movies rise and fall with a good bad guy .. cause he is the one the good guys are measured against .. but this guy was rather lame and most of all .. boring. He was the archetypical evil guy that would talk in one liners and degrade quickly from being near invincible to rather weak in the end.<br/><br/>There seemed to be a lot of plot points that were hinted at but never explained .. at the same time a lot of exposition that felt out of place. <br/><br/>What really shocked me were the terrible (and i mean really, really terrible) special effects .. that were worse than some home computer cutscenes. Actors being superimposed into a background .. but standing out worse than the weatherman at the forecast in front of a greenscreen. Muddy ""textures"" on some of the CGI environments and actors failing to properly interact with it. All in all.. it felt almost like a movie from the early 2000. 
But maybe i am missing a point here .. and the director WANTED it to look fake and comic book like? <br/><br/><br/><br/>But as a random movie .. it was actually quite a joyride. Not much story or meaning .. but a colourful and hectic journey of what was it? 2 hours or so. I do not regret having seen it, but i would not see it again - having the choice.<br/><br/>I can understand that people who actually do read comic books have very different feelings about this movie. I am sure there is more to the chracters than shown in this storyline"

To be fair, I avoided all media before watching the film and I didn't notice Henry Cavill's (Superman) mouth was CG. The colour pallet looks like someone has drink half a litre of Fanta and thrown up the screen it's that Orange. The plot is just disappointing, and the characters fell flat. Batman especially felt like the child the group, who had to babysat instead of a badass Superhero. I was overall disappointed.

","I really wanted to like Justice League. I wasn't overly impressed with BvS, but thought perhaps JL would save the franchise. Nothing in this film feels natural, everything seems dis-attached. Its almost as if this film was made by separate teems working without any kind of correspondence. <br/><br/>The score is abysmal, it feels completely separate to what is happening in the picture. As if someone is playing generic ""movie music"" in the background without looking at whats happening on screen. The Sound effects production is poor at best, with certain spot effects feeling completely out of place, and others feeling generic, as if just placed there to ""get the job out of the way"". <br/><br/>The CGI is difficult to swallow, the quality of Steppenwolf's CGI character animation is as bad as the infamous end scene in Scorpion King. Badly animated, rigid and that stupid expression on his face makes the character difficult to identify with. <br/><br/>Questionable effects quality plagues this film, sets look like sets, and some of the green screening seems very obvious, with backgrounds too contrasted with the foreground, making the character feel disconnected to whats happening in the story. Lighting also feels too ""set like"". <br/><br/>Dialogue feels too close and disconnected to the picture, the ADR work is too obvious, with the general audio mix being the worst I've heard in years. <br/><br/>I also found Barry Allen very irritating. Stupid attempts at a comic relief made his character annoying which I quite frankly found repugnant.<br/><br/>I know I am ranting on about tech stuff, I dont claim to be an expert, but as a consumer, I have become accustomed to a certain level of technical quality, and at 300 million budget, I really feel that a lot more could have been done here. Its a half arsed attempt. Did everyone working on this picture decide to give up on it half way through making it? It seems that way. <br/><br/>""Get it out the door so we can do the next Disney film"" must of been uttered by someone as some point during the making of this film. <br/><br/>Having said all of this, I did enjoy small segments of the action sequences.

"ssunny-social","5","0","3","26 February 2018"," Not As Bad as Rotten Tomatoes Makes It Look
","The film offers more character than we have seen in any DCEU films, whether it's the regular talks between Bruce and Arthur while trying to convince him to join the league or Bruce's walk by the lake with Diana. There is noticeable efforts to make it lighter in tone with the superheroes giving smirk whenever there is a chance and almost every slam being preceded by a one liner. Though the one liners are all funny, they could have brought that down a notch because at some point it starts looking like they are trying too hard. Some scenes, even Batman has been happily sacrificed of his dignified stature to accommodate one liners.<br/><br/>Though the repeated rolling of eyes and the playful childishness essayed by Ezra Miller wasn't even close to the charm of the Marvel equal, Spider man, it was nevertheless a refreshing addition. Aquaman does offer some dude laughs and Wonder Woman looks prettier than before. Cyborg could have been used more and Superman as Clark has added more colors to as a person in this film than he did in his previous two films.<br/><br/>
Some scenes had a straight from the Tim Burton's Batman feel with the cinematography and music, especially where all the superheroes land on the roof after Gordon calls Batman with the Bat-signal. The tone is as we have been hearing, inconsistent, from fresh natural light tone to almost nothing-visible-dark, from fresh open corn fields to a reddish-orange palette, I am still not complaining.<br/><br/>But one thing I am complaining, would be the villain. According to multiple sources it is one of the costliest films ever made and still if they couldn't get Steppenwolf right then they didn't negotiate well when making the deal with the VFX 3rd party. The action choreography was almost below average, not one scene where one would go wow for a punch or a kick. Zack as a director seems to have a changed a lot in his style, didn't notice any trademark style slo-mos or poetic close ups, a lot to do with his last film I suppose. The run time impressed me, it didn't brood, and concluded even quickly, a fantastic move by WB right before the release amidst huge spotlight.<br/><br/>Overall the film is far better than what we have been reading, may be we are all getting too critical about the DCEU and hence they have to work twice as hard to reach the same success of Marvel. Expect nothing but a thorough pop-corn entertainer and you will end up getting much more."

TDK-trilogy and Watchmen still hold my votes for best DC movies ever produced.<br/><br/>Somewhere it felt like they're trying to imitate Marvel - simple and fast pacing plot, no surprises, some jokes were forcefully placed, bad CGI, and a weak villain. Looks like they have concentrated too much on action instead of the plot.<br/><br/>I was hoping for more classic, dark, and serious Batman who doesn't care but his own version of justice. But how they portrayed him is, suddenly changed to a lighter mood, cracking little jokes - Not acceptable to me.<br/><br/>We know WW is DCEU's only hit, and Gal's charm has totally worked on WW's character, but that doesn't mean she would become the wisest, strongest, and dominant character of the league. Even Batman, King of Atlantis, The fastest man alive, and Cyborg felt like begging to WW - please guide us, we are nothing without you.<br/><br/>Aquaman isn't as bad-ass as he looks in trailers but still nicely portrayed and cracks some jokes too.<br/><br/>Flash is doing good so far, but slightly trying hard to be funny. This time his jokes just managed to land well, but hope he doesn't become next Lex Luthor from BvS or Joker from SS.<br/><br/>Superman, so he finally smiled! (with his digitally removed mustache). Good entry, just like what Superman deserves. He has become so powerful that he knocked out Steppenwolf who was ""bothering the others"" since two hours in just couple of punches - way too rushed on this part, otherwise Superman (again, except from his awkward lips CGI) was great.<br/><br/>Steppenwolf is the second worst villain after Enchantress and the CGI is just awful.<br/><br/>Overall good movie, definitely an improvement from MoS, and BvS, but maybe not as good as WW still."

","Plot; When an ancient threat arises again, Bruce Wayne endeavors to put together a team of heroes with unique abilities to stop it.<br/><br/>In the cinematic battle between DC and Marvel, the former is impossibly far behind. While Marvel is set to bring us their third go 'round with their team of mighty heroes this Summer, DC is just now releasing their first. Add in that Marvel carefully, methodically laid out their characters and their universe while DC zipped around like a fly at a picnic, and thus far it's simply been no contest. Marvel has had its less than stellar entries (Iron Man 3, Thor 2), but as a whole their cinematic universe is strong, cohesive and unified. Can DC even the score a bit with their super team up film? No. No they cannot.<br/><br/>Justice League feels rushed. Not just because characters enter the stage with no solo film to help set them up, but because the entire affair often feels like a shoddy cut 'n paste job. In this day and age of bloated running times I appreciate JL's attempt at brevity, but it's not the result of efficient storytelling so much as some suit saying ""Cut! Cut! Trim! Trim!"". Not helping matters is that this reported $300 million production looks cheap. The special f/x are anything but and it ultimately looks like a bad video game.

The Flash.<br/><br/>They will face a demon lord or something, whose army feeds on fear. Yes.<br/><br/>If you are keeping up to date with the superhero movies, then you know that Ben Affleck plays Bat, Henry Cahill is Super, Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman, and Jason Momia is cool-looking Aquaman.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller as The Flash is perhaps the only intriguing one out of the five main ones but he doesn't have much screen time, so it's easy to be memorable with his fine line between humorous and pathetic, which the actor handles extremely well.<br/><br/>With this being an all-star project, you also meet loads of stars from previous superhero movies returning as supporting characters, such as Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen from ""Wonder Woman"", Diane Lane and Amy Adams from ""Man of Steel"", and so on. Nobody really has anything interesting to do, so don't buy the ticket just to see them.<br/><br/>CiarÃ¡n Hinds is somewhat more intriguing as the main baddie, Steppenwolf, maybe thanks to looks which surely must remind the video game lovers of many fantasy epics they have spent countless hours on. But he doesn't have anything interesting to do either, which doesn't surprise, because nobody here has.<br/><br/>So... this surely must be one of the more aimless and soulless money-grabs of the whole wave of superhero movies attacking cinemas since the end of 1990's.<br/><br/>it's not clever, it's not funny, it's not original, there's never a palpable sense of danger, direction or suspense.<br/><br/>Action is heavily edited, over-stylised and over-coreographed, thus not looking very exciting or lively. And the fighting tiredly copies the same blueprint seen over and over since 2008's ""Iron Man"" first introduced it.<br/><br/>It means characters mostly flying through air and punching each other, destroying buildings and structures as a result of getting punched so hard that they fly away like rockets. Yes, it was new and original ten years ago but not after having seen it 5000 times or so.<br/><br/>The best thing I have to say about ""Justice League"" is that it's marginally better than DC's previous all-stars superhero movie, the dismal ""Suicide Squad"".<br/><br/>But it still sucks in every conceivable way. Better avoid. You live only once and can't get those two hours back, feebly waiting for something interesting to happen.<br/><br/>There are two ""hidden"" end scenes, one in the beginning of the end credits and the other one right after. I liked them a bit more than everything preceding them. But they are, of course, also short, not lasting 120 minutes as the whole movie.<br/><br/>""Justice League"" doesn't deserve neither your money nor time. It often does not even feel like a proper, cohesive movie. More like a good looking trailer... which sadly lasts seemingly forever.<br/><br/>The project has had a long and arduous way to the screen, but this doesn't justify the sheer poop they have produced for piles of money and with hundreds of people involved."

"DaniHM","4","0","1","26 January 2018"," Too much effect for too simple and basic story (the same as always)
","It is very likely that the movie Justice League is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. Two hours of absolute scandal, a storm of special effects that sometimes even feels too much. Besides the movie does not have a single drama scene that lasts more than two minutes and I really feel the director did this to avoid the viewer from falling asleep. When other drama sci-fi like Blade Runner 2049, Ex Machina or Minority Report have a silent, we wonder, we believe, we brainstorm, we try to get what's going on and what is about to happen, but in Justice League it just makes the lack of this movie more evident, lack of any drama beyond 'let's save the world for one last time (again)'. The issue here is that director Zach Snyder seems to have given up on this and still rely on the fandom to score the box office promised to the producers. DC Comics was looking for its Avengers series, and I believe they have done a movie that needed to be done, but it is sad that the only thing this has done is to fill a blank space. The story begins with an astonishing Gal Gadot, pushing again for women in superhero movies, saving people from being killed by an armed bank robber. I wasn't expecting that. Then Ben Affleck, who I don't know why he is still Batman, tries to play the cool but serious guy with a Jeremy Irons that just seems too much for Alfred, an old and smart butler, please don't do this to Irons again. Then, this unnecessary fit, tattooed and mentally disturbed Aquaman plays the 'get out of my lawn' role, until, of course, he doesn't. It is great they added 'The Flash', because it is really the only light in this, he is the only unpredictable character. Maybe because we have not seen him in ten other movies. Oh, and they bring Superman back to life, perhaps to make another three movies of him saving humanity, we'll see. I am not going to go over the plot because it is quite easy to guess and it will be unlikely to fail. Spectacular visual effects need to have a bit of a story and this feels like the same but in a different container. And this is really upsetting me because it is becoming a popular practice."

","After years of anticipation, DC's answer to The Avengers has arrived. It's been a rough road for DC, with all but one of the movies being either panned by critics, or receiving mixed reviews. After a complicated production process, the final product is quite the mixed bag. First, the good. The league works well together, and they all develop quite well. Batman and Aquaman learn to work in a group, Wonder Woman is still the strong leader she was, and the Flash is a good comic relief. That chemistry between the group is vital, as the movie could not possibly be good in the slightest without it. And, to the movie's credit, they handle this quite well. The Flash was surprising, and the movie managed to give him a backstory and character development. Aquaman looked and fought cool, but wasn't as interesting a character as he could have been. Batman was much better in this movie than he was in BvS, and they at least tried to redeem him from his portrayal in BvS. If you think he's going to be as good as he was in the Nolan trilogy, don't. Jeremy Irons is also a great Alfred. Wonder Woman may not be as good as she was in her solo movie, but the way she and the Amazons connect to the overall story is very interesting. And, the bad. Steppenwolf was one lame villain. He's remarkably generic, seeking the Mother Boxes to destroy the world. And the fight scenes with him, Aquaman, and Wonder Woman appear to be recycled. His lack of clear motivation is also a problem. Yes, there is apparently a deleted scene with Darkseid in it, but that really should have been in it to begin with. Even if it's exactly like the Thanos scene in The Avengers, it would have made the movie as a whole better than if they dropped it. Cyborg is all edgy and brooding. While that is understandable, given his situation, it just feels like the same crap we saw in the previous DCEU movies. Still, his presence here also means we'll probably never see a proper Teen Titans movie. Superman's return, even ignoring its predictability, was extremely cringeworthy. Also, it teases Green Lantern, but he doesn't appear outside of flashbacks. That's not cool. Given the internal issues there were at DC, you can pick this movie apart and see ""the Zack Snyder parts"" and ""the Joss Whedon parts."" It's quite evident who would have done it better. The future of the DCEU has been questioned lately, as Justice League didn't do nearly as expected at the box office. DC absolutely needs to turn things around in their next few films if they want this franchise to be successful."
"prabhatrayal","6","0","1","23 January 2018"," Doesn't Do Justice to DCEU
","I think DC is going through an Identity crisis. They are in a big quandary. They have no idea what they should do with their films. They used to make dark films (One of the reasons I prefer DC over Marvel) but critics were not too happy with that, so now they are going the Marvel way, making films with colours and a lighter tone. Marvel has excelled the art of making such films and it works most of the time. That is exactly what DC is trying to do here. Unfortunately, it did not work. Some of the jokes were good but most of them were cringeworthy.
Justice League is not that bad but it could have been much better. I mean, It is the first Justice League movie. Who was not excited for this? I loved the animated JL and was really pumped up for this. That is why was a big letdown for me. It was too cliched and weak. I have two big problems with this film.
The villain is too generic - just like Marvel villains (Marvel villains are pretty weak. Hela was amazing though). Steppenwolf is another one of those I-am-going-to-destroy-the-world kind. He is a powerful villain in the comics, the movie version sucked. Say what you want to say about Man of Steel but Zod was an amazing villain. One of the most well developed villains in superhero films ever.
Another problem with this film is that the characters are not well developed. I think they should have made the solo films first. First Avengers came out after Iron Man, Spiderman, Captain America, Hulk and Thor. We knew most of those characters. That can not be said about this film. We had three new characters without any development. The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg. They were all flat and one dimensional.
I have loved Ben Affleck as Batman in the previous films but his acting was pretty wooden in this one. It seemed to me that he was not interested. Same is the case with Gal Gadot. She is fine but she was much better in her solo film. Director matters when it comes to getting the best out of your actors. Too bad Jenkins did not direct it and Snyder left in the middle.
There were other minor issues with the film. The CGI was pretty video-gamish. You can deliver a much better experience for $300 Million. I have no idea what they spent that amount on. Also, the background score was totally forgettable. I could recognise the Batman, WW and Superman themes and that was all.
Now the good things.
The Amazonians fighting Steppenwolf is pretty well done.
Overall, Justice League is another forgettable flick from DC. It is not as vomit-inducing as Suicide Squad but it is not great either."

+ Why they make Flash extremely idiot? In the movie he is so clumsy, tell idiots and basic jokes and the worst is that they didn't called Grant Gustin to represent Barry Allen, when he is one of the most succesfull actors in superheroes movies.
+ Steppenwolf represented like a tiny screaming dog. ONE OF THE MOST SUPERVILLANS IN DC HISTORY, thats it's inmortal by the case and it survived Doomsday, yes the same one that kills Superman. He gets presentated like a badass but he gets take down so easy like it was a normal villain.
+ Didn't try to put Green Lantern. They should have put Green Lantern with a new actor, the arc of the movie would have been much interesting.
+ Ben Affleck its the worst Batman. Horrible acting for god sake, awfull and boring scenes and dialogues of batman.
But the movie has good points:
+ Aquaman and wonder woman saved the movie, excellent acting. Ciborg its not bad by the way."

","There was no real connection to most characters or the villain to be built.
as quick as it started it also ended.
it's a shame, especially after the man of steel and wonder woman movie.
feels like a reoccuring curse of DC to throw out good movies that will be forgotten by their mediocre ones.
after suicide squad it's a shame it had to be this one aswell.
probably next time it's better to prepare the audience with movies that will focus on each hero at a time before bringing them together to make a movie on each hero afterwards.
it's not a really bad movie like suicide squad, but it's still a god aweful shame seeing a movie containing the main hero cast of DC put together to fight evil in such a weak fashion."

"werecow2003","4","0","1","15 January 2018"," More generic throwaway superhero droning
","God this movie sucked. This one's yet another dose of the most generic superhero crap. Seriously, what's the appeal at this point? Basically it's a bad clone of The Avengers, which imho was already a very mediocre movie. Completely overpowered, cardboard, cartoony characters, over-reliance on poorly done CGI, generic villain, zero real struggle or drama, and the same story as every single one of these movies. Here, I'll spoil the entire thing for you. See if you had a vague inkling of what this was going to be like:
 
""Generic villain #132 tries to use the (all spark, no I mean tesseract, no I mean infinity stone, no wait, it's) mother box McGuffin to try to destroy the world while wise-cracking one liners, forcing our heroes to overcome their differences and band together to defeat him and save the day while cracking crappy jokes, thereby destroying any tension that might have existed.""<br/><br/>Sound familiar? Notice how I can describe the entire plot of the movie without telling you anything you didn't already know just from the fact that this is a superhero movie from the 2010s. Does it even count as a spoiler? I'm not so sure at this point.
Tries to be dark and brooding but fails miserably, because they can't make up their mind and peppered the whole thing with jokes that almost all fall flat. As always in this genre-decade-combo, everything is so epic as to be reduced to bland visual noise that plays on people's two second attention span, but fails to invoke any real sense of danger or drama at any point. 
There is barely any story telling at all. What little remains is forgettable and plays essentially no role in the movie. They try to create conflict in some of the characters but then make the conflict so easily overcome as to be immaterial. To create some drama, as a placeholder for the perils that all of humanity faces, there's just a random nameless poor Russian family that finds itself repeatedly accosted by the big bad guy for some reason. It doesn't work because we have no connection to this family at all. It's just a set of briefly seen nameless faces substituted for the faceless masses that are really supposedly at risk.
The dialogue is moronic (particularly the technobabble), but then what else is new. The story is utterly predictable. Some of the camera work and cinematography didn't totally suck, but who could tell, since everything seems to be CGI (and it's not particularly convincing). 
There is literally nothing new here. It's so generic and forgettable that I could have not watched this and remembered more of it than I do now. I typed this review during the epic last battle and missed nothing at all. How are people not hating this utter feces? It's not even good enough to be bad. It's just nothing. This gets a 7/10 on IMDB now. Blegh. Screw that. 4-/10 at the very most, and that's me being very generous. What movie was this again? I've already forgotten I watched it while the credits are still playing."

","The seven original members of Justice League are Superman, Aquaman, Flash, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Did not they know that? They had a budget of 300 millions. They had the money to bring in all of the original seven members of the Justice League. They could have at least bring in the Martian Manhunter since they think bringing Green Lantern is a bad choice. It is not like it is Green Lantern's fault. Green Lantern is awesome. They could not find a nice story line and make a real costume. But forget that subject, now that people are accepting and watching DC Movies like Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman , they should consider every possibility for making a decent movie. Their movie released strategy is all wrong. They should have introduced all seven character first one by one with a solo movie of their origin with giving hint and connection for the next movie and about the Justice League. The budget should have been sufficient, not much, not less. Then they could have made Justice League with a big budget consisting all of the original seven members and of course with a best story line and a biggest super villain like Darkseid. It would have awesome and I strongly believe that people would watch that movie a lot. Then after a long time when Superman is on the side of the government and Batman is a criminal of the law who fight crime, they could have made Batman Vs Superman and as a sequel the could have made BvS Dawn of Justice. But they did the BvS very early, introduced a boy Lex Luthor, Killed Superman, made Justice League without the seven members with a lame super villain that people don't even know. And that is why Justice League 2017 could not attract people and failed at the box office. By they, I mean the people responsible for making the DC Extended Universe Movies. And think they should learn from their mistakes and make better movies in the future. I hope that very much because I am a biggest fan of the DC Universe."

I refuse to accept that I have 'matured' to the point of not being able to give myself over to 'comic' universes. My maturity settings are safely encrypted and password protected from change from exterior threats. And, I recently praised a lower budget movie as a better comic book movie than the blockbusters.
My fallback position with weak storied sci-fi/fantasy is to just enjoy the candy onscreen.

"hunter-friesen","4","0","1","9 January 2018"," Just when you thought the DCEU couldn't get any worse after Suicide Squad
","After directing the disappointing and critically panned Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Zack Snyder has returned with interim director Joss Whedon to make DC's answer to Marvel's The Avengers. Unfortunately, this film reeks of desperation to be lighter than BvS and also keep the high intensity of Man of Steel. The film gets neither of these right and what we are left with is a film that is more annoying than funny and more melodramatic than intense. Apart from the awful Suicide Squad, this the laziest and most disappointing superhero team-up film to have come out in this new age of high-quality comic films. 
Evil has begun to invade Earth since the ""death"" of Superman. Both Batman and Wonder Woman have been trying to make sense of what exactly is going on and what it all means. They find out that the source of this evil is from the villain Steppenwolf, who has come to Earth in search of three Mother Boxes that hold almost unlimited power. Combining all three will unleash apocalyptic power that will destroy all life on Earth. Batman and Wonder Woman must quickly the remaining heroes and create a team to stop Steppenwolf's plan for world destruction. 
While having a very simple plot, Justice League is still very hard to follow. It's easy to understand on a basic level, but hard to comprehend any deeper because of horrendous editing and dull exposition. The plot is also underdeveloped in many key areas, specifically the introductions of the new heroes. Aquaman and Cyborg are barely given any backstory and are very one-dimensional characters. They each behave the same way throughout the film and don't give me any confidence that their future standalone films will be pleasant to watch. The Flash is given a moderately good story, but his character is so extremely annoying that I didn't care at all about him. A whole film around him is something I never want to see, but unfortunately, we will get in 2020. 
Steppenwolf is also one of the worst on-screen comic book villains in recent memory. He is very one dimensional and doesn't have a single memorable trait as all he talks about is death and how is superior to humans. He feels like an eighties cartoon villain that should never have been considered for DC's biggest film. There is also the problem that he looks like a cross between a billy goat and a dead tree. 
Interim director Joss Whedon came aboard the project after Snyder left in order to deal with personal family issues. His goal was to lighten up the film with more humor and boy does he miss the mark. His attempts at comedy through one-liners go over horribly and make the film feel so disconnected from the previous DCEU films. You can't go from the serious Man of Steel and BvS to this and expect things to feel like they are part of one big narrative. 
For a film that had an almost $300 million budget, the money was not used well on the technical aspects. The cinematography, editing, and visual effects are some of the worst I have seen in a big budget film. The camera is never in the right place during a fight scene and the editing is overly quick. A one minute fight looks as if it had fifty cuts and makes the whole thing disorientating and unbearable to watch. The CGI is substandard, especially for characters like Cyborg and Steppenwolf that both rely heavily on visual effects for their look. Both of them can't be taken seriously as they look extremely fake. Aquaman's underwater battle sequence also looked startlingly bad, which makes me worried about his standalone film that will take place completely underwater. 
The fight choreography is also uninspiring and is recycled from previous films as Wonder Woman literally does the same moves from her solo film. She smashes her bracelets together every time she's getting beat and immediately starts winning again. This happens three or four times and each time it gets more and more boring to watch. By the time the final battle comes along you've already seen all the moves that are going to be done. 
The acting overall is bad and every returning character has gotten worse since the last time we saw them. Batman isn't cool anymore and never lets up on how old he is. The one thing nobody needs is a Batman that tells jokes. Affleck couldn't look more bored and tired of playing this character. I feel ashamed to have said that I liked Affleck's Batman better than Bale's after watching BvS. 
Gal Gadot does a pretty good job reprising Wonder Woman but is still underwhelming compared to how she was in her standalone film. She doesn't feel like the leader of the team and doesn't interact well with any of the other heroes. 
Jason Momoa portrays Aquaman just like his character Khal Drogo on Game of the Thrones. He's buff and over manly, but isn't exciting to watch or listen to since he never really does anything interesting except throw his trident from time to time. 
Cyborg is barely present in the film and is not played that well by stage actor Ray Fisher. He's too grim all the time and is tonally way different than the other versions of the character we are used to. There isn't much to remember him by and overall it's questionable if he even should have been in the movie, let alone get his own future film. 
Last and definitely least is Ezra Miller as The Flash. He is downright annoying and immediately ruins any scene he is in. His jokes, relatability, and action scenes are just plain bad. The perfectly adequate Grant Gustin should have been cast instead as he has proved on television he can make The Flash both funny and emotional. 
The DCEU is now zero for five when it comes to adapting its heroes to the big screen and have astonishingly gotten worse as time has progressed. This film had everything going wrong for it and gives me no confidence that any of the future standalone films will be good. I expect to write every year how DC still hasn't been able to make good superhero films in a cinematic universe."

","Justice League is a film co-written and directed by Zack Snyder. I guess every superhero fan would have wanted this film and it is finally out. I have grown up watching the animated series of the DC characters. And the trailer of Justice League also showed that they might redeem themselves. But alas, I was wrong.<br/><br/>Plot: Steppenwolf wants to find the three mother boxes in Earth and it's upto a band of superheroes before its too late.<br/><br/>Story and direction: The film basically is 120 minutes. That is quite short for a film liked Justice League. And also that is felt in the film for many scenes. For example, like I know things that happened to Flash (courtesy tv show). But I don't what actually happened with Cyborg and Aquaman. I mean I don't want a whole kind of backstory but atleast some details could have done it. Some details are provided, but as for people who are not avid comic book readers, you feel somewhat lost. Then we have Steppenwolf. I mean except for just appearing, kicking peoples a** and taking motherboxes, he basically has nothing to do. He was the wekeat thing in this entire film. Then we have a town in the finale that has only one family. I mean I get it, that there was some radioactive explosion or something, but seriously one family!!!! They could have done with a vacant town or something like a population of 100-200 people (when Cyborg just happens to say we have resettlements going on). And the topping was Superman's face. Oh my god. Each time I felt like just turning away from the screen in those scenes. His face looked like some plastic surgery had been done. Also many things shown in the trailers were not in the film, which was disappointing. Also there is a lot of over-sexualization to the Amazonians especially Wonder Woman. That was not great at all. But its not all bad. There is some good. I liked the characterizations behind Aquaman and Barry Allen. The tone for those characters were very light and provided some entertainment. Also great were introduction to Green Lantern universe. The battles fought were awesome. My jaw dropped almost every time. The Superman ressurection was great. A special mention to Danny Elfman for his score especially the Batman tune that evoked many memories. <br/><br/>Performances: Ben Affleck was again wonderful as Batman. The same can be said for Gal Gadot. I liked her in her solo venture and so in this film. Jason Mamoa was perfect for Aquaman and so as Ezra Miller as The Flash. Henry Cavill did quite good although much wasn't given to him. Same can also be said for Amy Adams and Diane Lane. Liked J K Simmons as Jim Gordon and hope to see him in future films. Jeremy Irons too was perfect again as Alfred. <br/><br/>Favorite Scene: Easily would be the meeting between Lois and Clark after Clark's resurrection. The emotion that flowed in that scene just touched my heart. <br/><br/>Verdict: To be very fair, Justice League is a one time watch. It was not the film I wanted but it is not a bad film too. It can come in the OK category. I don't know how many films are yet there in the DCEU but they seriously have to get their gear moving and stop imitiating the MCU. It's just high time.<br/><br/>I would go with a 6/10."
"chunkiefroth","4","0","1","30 December 2017"," I Have Seen Far Worse, But. . .
","Some things are not so easily excused. Namely Clark Kent's goony CGI mouth. I would rather have the mustache. . . seriously. If shaving is so far beyond out of the question, witch is ludicrous in and of itself, don't do what this movie did. Superman looks like a living flyer for a long missing child, age progressed into adulthood. Other than this most effects were passable, and some pretty cool.<br/><br/>Little Flash Person isn't very good, and his part just sucks. The kid is mostly there for unnecessary comic relief in a cartoon of a movie featuring Superman's digital face, looking like somebody microwaved a Bruno Mars action figure. The film didn't need relief, as it never approached serious. Also unneeded is Little Flash Person's entire subplot about being a good boy, and trying to help out his Pap-pap.
There is a point where Little Flash Person claims he is working 5+ jobs. We are to assume his speed makes this possible. . . though only if we are as stupid as Justice League believes we are. Sure. . . use your powers to cut down your work hours when your whole purpose for working is to try to get money. Every aspect of this character is just as stupid, except for the Speed Force effect which is pretty cool at times.<br/><br/>Batman sucked, aside from select moments.<br/><br/>Aquaman had moments. . . of unintentional comedy.<br/><br/>Cyborg was the most interesting character. Too bad he was practically wasted.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman was there. Her first scene was fun. . . and she's pretty.<br/><br/>Speaking of pretty. . . why is Ma Kent hotter than Lois Lane? I don't fault the movie for that, but I do find it confusing.<br/><br/>Jeremy Irons can do better.<br/><br/>You got Joss Whedon in my Zack Snyder.<br/><br/>Final verdict is five out of ten. A safe middle of the road score for a painfully average film about a digital faced Superman, who's upper teeth look like pillows, fighting a generic enemy with a popular name.

","DC is trying to expand its universe, like Avengers does for Marvel. They bring together a band of 6 heroes who were introduced with MoS, BvS and WW, to face a new foe (Steppenwolf) that requires a team of superpowered people to be defeated.<br/><br/>All the tools were present. Diverse heroes, backgrounds, powers, villains, but still it fails to deliver. Why? For several reasons. Each reason itself shouldn't be a problem, but all together in one movie is too big a pill to swallow.<br/><br/>Batman is a hero that can carry the whole of DC on his back, but not in a team. Batman himself is the personification of anti-social disorder in something that should feel like a team of friends or colleages. It also doesn't help that Ben Affleck seemed uninspired, as opposed to BvS. Wonder Woman has the advantage of mythology, but other than that, Gal Gadot (WW) and Jason Momoa (Aquaman) can't act for sh*t. Not sure if this is because of their acting skills, or because of a flawed script, because their lines where at times cringeworthy. Not too mention the villain. The good voice work is overshadowed by nothingness. The villain feels unknown, uninspired and uneffective. He never feels like the ultimate villain that might bring the apocalypse. After WW and BvS they AGAIN took the risk of having a CGI villain. Sometimes it works, but apparently not in this movie. More background information in order to be able to relate or to understand might have helped.<br/><br/>This doesn't mean the movie has nothing to offer, because there are several good parts. First of all, what the movies did right was offer a glimps of more to come. Hints of Steppenwolf, Apokalips and Darkseid instead of showing too much. I hope DC will show more of Darkseid, with a proper introduction. Superman himself was never more interesting than here. He was not introduced as the most powerful hero, but as powerful and potentially very dangerous man. His turn from confused to good was rushed, but that is not Henry Cavill's fault. Cyborg's background sounds like the most generic one, but Ray Fisher's acting shows Cyborgs human conflicted side in a very robotic and alien body. Ray Fisher and Henry Cavill were the only ones in this movie who properly understand ""less is more"". Flash was also a welcome addition. Although sometimes misplaced, his comedy was what was lacking in the previous movies and it was never too much, although sometimes a distraction. Every team needs a lighter note.<br/><br/>And finally the action. Although the CGI was at times obvious the action was a delight. It felt as if they let go, and gave every hero the chance to shine. The only thing lacking was an enemy that you could actually care about, but that doesn't diminish that this superhero movie is also an enjoyable action movie.<br/><br/>Even with the good parts, this movie is flawed. It absolutely works as a standalone action movie for kids or for a new generation. But as a build up for a universe to expand on..... well, there is nothing that feels worth expanding on, due to the lacking of interesting backgrounds and connection.<br/><br/>The lesson to be learned here: Even if all the tools for success are present, without chemistry and introduction, there is no decent end product."

","Fortunately I never had a high expectation towards the movie and thank God I didn't.At the high disappointment from dawn of justice,I found this movie just the same except from wonder woman who acted better this time and so as her movie which was interesting.As for the rest they were boring not that I didn't expect that.And The flash jokes were enjoyed by twelve years kids only.I thought Grant Gustin was worst but how wrong I was.Ezra Miller is even worse.Anyway the 4 star rating goes to wonder woman and the villain As for the rest,You get a zero from me!!"
"MaxHuskins","6","0","1","27 December 2017"," A movie you've already seen a thousand times.
","First of all, full disclaimer: I'm not a fan of DC, I have not seen BvS but I have seen Wonder Woman and Suicide Squad.<br/><br/>I honestly don't even know where to being with this mediocre overly generic movie. It wasn't good, nor was it bad. It was ""meh"". The best way I can describe is by calling it the ""Spy Kids 3"" of this film era. Kids love it, mildly entertaining with lots of crapy CGI that already looks dated.<br/><br/>The biggest problem at work here is the genre itself, we as viewers are so fatigued by the same superhero films that I'm gonna gouge my eyes out if I see a few more of these. We've got our boring two-dimensional heroes, going on a pointless quest against an evil CGI space dude who is out to destroy the whole world (or even galaxy) with his generic army of minions who make a big CGI explosion/thingy that the heroes fight at the end at night with a bunch of bright (usually red) CG particles (lava, goo, magic, the source of life in the universe, you name it).<br/><br/>This movie has some of the weirdest pacings I've ever seen, it's confusing, one second we're here, next second we're there. The editing maybe even worse, often the jarring cuts take you out of the scene/movie and make absolutely no sense. I think this partially has to do with the fact that like 90% of this movie is CGI, all the camera angles are whack, actors aren't in the same room and the set is just a green screen, I mean what can you expect? I honestly don't understand this masturbatory overuse of CGI, why can't you drive to a damn cornfield and shoot on location? Why does it have to be all made inside a WB warehouse? Yes, I'm gonna complain about CG a LOT because it doesn't need to be that. DO we really need to shove dust/ambient fire/water particles into every scene? I understand that it's not supposed to be realistic but at a certain point, your brain hits a sensory overload and just zones out during the most crucial moments. It's basically like showing a baby a clip of a bunch of nonsense bright colours and they'll watch it for hours. This movie honestly feels like someone put together cut scenes from a video game.<br/><br/>Besides the bad camera work and editing, we have my personal favourite - awful dialogue. 
Most of the jokes are completely flat with a few exceptions that are failed by the absolute worst delivery in the world (as well as the awkward cuts that I mentioned earlier.) Also, I don't think I've ever heard humans talk like they do in this movie. One of my favourite dialogues in the movie was (Mild spoilers that aren't really spoilers because everyone knows this): 
Superman and his GF finally reunite, she says to a shirtless Superman ""You smell nice"", to which he replies ""Did I not before?"" proceeded by an awkward silence in a wide shot and they begin holding hands. What the hell, who does that?! 
Another favourite stupid moment of mine was when Aquaman skates on a dead body similar to the infamous Legolas skating scene in LOTR.<br/><br/>The whole thing feels like a fever dream of an Artificial Intelligence machine generating a movie that hits every demand of the studio executives.<br/><br/>I would give this movie 6.5 out of 10, however, I have a special personal rule for point deduction - bad Russian. Yup, this movie just like every other one has horrible Russian accents, balalaika music in the background when showing us the unimportant Russian characters AND they drive a truck! There are no flatbed trucks in Russia. Do your god damn research Hollywood. Is it really that freaking hard to find 3 people who speak fluent Russian?<br/><br/>Overall, I expected nothing and I came out of the theatre with nothing. I didn't waste my time nor did I really enjoy it. It was kind of like I went to sleep for two hours and then woke up from a weird dream. To summarize, we had an unemotional soundtrack, bad pacing, flat acting, horrible dialogue and atrocious editing. With a couple of cool scenes.<br/><br/>Justice League leaves me with one question and one question only: Why does Superman leave chem-trails behind? Haha<br/><br/>My verdict - Instantly Forgettable 5.5/10<br/><br/>P/S<br/><br/>With all of that said I would like to acknowledge all the VFX teams because certain shots did look pretty damn incredible. VFX artists are some of the most overworked, underpaid, abused and unappreciated team members of a movie production, but without them, this movie wouldn't be possible. You guys did a good job."
"Wirxaw","5","0","1","26 December 2017"," DC don't learn, do they?
","One would think that after four movies - DC would learn something. The senseless action of Man of Steel, the disgorged story of Batman vs Superman, the sheer, utter stupidity of Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman... And they've brought all the worst parts of the three together. Now, before I get too far, I'll admit that the movie is has a contrast with BvS - if BvS started fine and ended terribly, then this movie does the opposite: start terribly, but improve by the end. Which is why, ultimately, 4-6\10 is something this movie deserves, no more, no less. It's no Suicide Squad or Iron Man 3, there is something good hidden within it, but it's hidden among a heap of trash.<br/><br/>First things first - the opening, the premise, the story and the scenery. All the minor details that add up to the cringe. In the opening scene we see Batman struggle\toy with a minor criminal, causing collateral damage just to... apparently attract an alien scout that... well, just came out of nowhere. And Bats left the criminal just like that. This scene is so badly written, poorly executed with camera cuts and has so little practical value to the movie that it could easily have been covered by exposition. Because it's hard to find a lesser evil between a bad cringeworthy scene and extra exposition, which this movie already holds aplenty. This sets the premise of parademons and the invasion. Now, apparently Lex Luthor was spoofing something about it, but... You know, the properly big Marvel movies feature properly big stakes. There is a reason why Thor 2 was panned - because an apparent universal threat was dealt in a duel within like one square kilometer. This is the same thing. Doomsday was a thing that even Superman couldn't stand up to, and Lex somehow knew and was mumbling about this Steppenwolf, back then, much more devil-looking godlike creature. Now, of course, Darkseid was mentioned and he is somewhere in P3 with Thanos, but what did this Steppenwolf turn out to be? Some retextured Ares with vague abilities that could take on the five heroes just fine, but who didn't even remotely stand a chance against Superman? Man, the balance and the stakes in this movie are sooo off. Batman's daring attempt to revive Supe was so bold that I thought... wait, wait wait wait, wasn't this supposed to be JUSTICE LEAGUE? Nope. The movie spent so much time sucking the idea of Superman's importance(boy, how on Earth did the world live for thousands of years before this freak came around) that it's really sad how everything must revolve around one character. Maybe they should write a New Testament or something... Instead of showing a competent team action with a failure and a chance to recognize this failure and look for compromise, we are thrown into a half-reared resurrection, even more ridiculous Supe vs JL fight than Civil War showdown(and that's saying something), and then we get a boring beatdown of the team by one weirdly written antagonist, all the while KNOWING that Superman is coming, and when he comes - it's a total pushover. Just like in Wonder Woman. There is not even that ridiculous choice scene of the Man of Steel, the enemy is just stomped. And, talking about scenery, I guess they really had to call some spot in ""Russia"" as the ""rear end"" of the world. And they really made some lovely remarks about it. I guess there was a good reason to bring another country into the mix, and an even better one to just leave it at that. That Steppenwolf would've been nuked six ways from Sunday before these heroes even began sorting out their hormones...<br/><br/>Talking about heroes, I see DC has tried desperately to replicate the levity and the humor of Suicide Squad.... of the lack thereof. Barry, apparently, loves his dad who killed his mom and it's so sobby and teary that we don't have a clue whether he did that, why did he do that and why does Barry even care for his father still. This character story is just there for the checkerbox. And Barry himself seems to be a very weird guy, who apparently has already built himself a suit(that even Bats complimented) and is living quite the life. The comedian of the team, he looks about as silly as a Spiderman copy. And this is something I would rather not touch with a 5-foot pole. Cyborg is a brooding and annoying teen in a metal suit, who seems to have been built from the Allspark... I mean, the Tesseract... Ugh, screw this, who transforms like a terminator.<br/><br/>Wonder Woman is as terrible as ever, Gal Gadot's desperate attempt at facial expressions really hit that nail in her coffin as an actor. I mean, just look at her while she was looking for Cyborg in that dark street - I haven't seen such an unusual face in a while. I think she needs to take a few lessons from Trump - the guy can make an expression. And her powers - DC really has gone ""ah, duck it, we'll just roll with it"". Superspeed, super reflexes, indestructible gear... I thought Woman Woman was terrible, but this bank robbery scene has really gone so overboard that I really couldn't care less about her character. She is like Mario - brain hurtingly stupid in everything, but... loved for... reasons.<br/><br/>Aquaman was really out place. Even more than Barry - he felt like he was there just for the poster image. Indestructible, without any special powers, he, WW and Cyborg really were very generic in this movie. The reason Marvel succeeds - is because their heroes are unique. Each has a role and a style, weak points and special stuff. DC lacks that. Superman is a brute. Wonder Woman is basically a female Superman now. Aquaman is like a lesser Superman, but still a brute. Cyborg is a terminator brute. Barry is a pizza delivery service. And Batman's greatest power is to have big machines torn apart by brutes.<br/><br/>I mentioned that the movie gets better in the end - yes, the action and some visuals are decent, but, again, with the revived Superman, with the pathetic copy of Tesseract\Infinity stones, the bad writing of the antagonist and the vague heroes - it only gets ""so"" much better. It's better than the last Fantastic Four, definitely, but Justice League still fails to do DC heroes justice(pun intended).<br/><br/>DC needs to focus on character development: unique sides, personality, strengths and weaknesses. The story must feel like a whole picture, not a bunch of notes thrown together. The enemy must have the scale, the stakes, the impact. Even Marvel suffers there, even Ultron did, but damn did the character of Ultron deliver. Hell, Ares had a little screen time and he was a better villain. DC takes notes from Marvel's worst movies: WW copied First Avenger, this thing copies The Dark World. Is this really what it takes to be different from GOOD movies?<br/><br/>I'll finish my review with something very, very cold. And I'm not sorry for it. ""Groot had more personality in GotG than any of Justice League."" Ruminate on that."

","Pros
They finally get character of Superman finally right. This is great movie for Superman fans and if it was called Man of Steel 2 or Superman returns I would have given it 2.5 star
Erza Millar is great as Barry Allen
Cons
The tagline says ""You can't save the world alone"" seriously did the marketing even watch the movie. Superman single handedly saves everyone. Rest of the league characters are entirely useless in the movie. I was expecting a team fight like Avengers, where every member contributes to saving the world. No! It just Superman. He is so powerful that I don't see how other league members can help him. 
Batman is useless in the movie and out of character. 
Wonder Woman who can take blows from doomsday and is fast enough to deflect machine gun bullets goes down with single blow from Superman.Not to mention she was not doing anything for past 100 years.She is suppose to be Zeus daughter and a God but she still cannot even fly. 
Aquaman again like Batman is useless. 
Cyborg would have been great but most of his scenes were cut from movie. Instead he is nothing more than tech support.
Only Flash was the saving grace in the movie with his comedy. The villain was generic Alien Warlord who turned into a Joke when Superman showed upPros

"JJdaPK","2","0","1","25 December 2017"," One of the worst superhero movies ever made
","I got almost no enjoyment out of this one, and it was by far my worst moviegoing experience of the last few years. Even bad superhero movies like Batman Forever and Batman and Robin -as horrendously stupid as they are - had impressive set pieces, camp value and some standout moments.<br/><br/>This was just painfully boring. All of the newcomers (Flash/Aquaman/Cyborg) have rushed introductions and I wasn't given much of a reason to care about them. Even Batman and Wonder Woman lacked moments emotionally resonated with me, despite them having appeared in previous DCEU films. The big problem is that there are simply not enough screentime dedicated to fleshing out the Justice League's relationships with one another. By the end of the first Avengers film, all of our heroes felt like a team. At the end of this movie, they still felt like acquaintances at best.<br/><br/>There was no real ""story"". No character journey. Just a haphazard excuse to throw these characters together. It felt almost like a video game. Except the action scenes, for the most part, sucked. I liked the fight against Superman (who was easily the best thing about this mess), but that's about it. <br/><br/>The villain was bland, with a generic take over or end the world plot, and he had no real relationship with any of the Justice League members (to be fair, most of the Marvel movies suffer from this as well). <br/><br/>I suspect Joss Whedon was responsible for adding in the humorous scenes, probably in hopes that they would distract the audience from how tedious and grim and slow the rest of the movie was. While the Flash got a few laughs, most of the jokes did not land. And even if they did all land, they would not be enough to save this miserable excuse of a movie. <br/><br/>It's such a shame too, because the cast is REALLY GOOD! I like Batfleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Ezra Miller, Ray Fisher and Henry Cavill. They are all great choices for their characters. But the script and the directing and the editing let them all down.<br/><br/>I didn't see Batman vs. Superman in theaters because everyone acted like it was the worst thing ever. While I think that movie missed the mark and I would only give it like a 5.5/10, I was never constantly looking at my phone to see how much time had passed like I did with Justice League. I thought Batman vs Superman was an ambitious movie with a lot of good moments. Justice League was just a poor attempt to capture the success of the Avengers. Here's a tip Warner Brothers: Seeing several superheroes team up is only cool if we care about the superheroes in the first place!<br/><br/>Worst superhero movie of the year. It joins the ranks of Green Lantern/Superman 3 and 4 as one of the worst superhero movies ever made. It's worse than Fantastic Four 2015 (which was compelling for at least the first half of the movie), and worse than Catwoman, which is enjoyable on a ""it's so bad it's good"" level."

","First of all, I wanted to cry at the end of the movie because it made hate Justice League specially the trio (Bat, Supes, WW). This movie is so bad that I had the plain face all the time watching it. 80% Movie is Joss Whedon's so called fun ride. You will notice the absence of Zack Snyder's vision. I am a marvel and DC fan but I get the idea of their differences. Marvel is light and fun but DC is dark and gritty. It's a simple thing to understand.That's why DC can pull Injustice and marvel can't. I really liked Batman v Superman. But Justice League ruin my childhood memories, The only thing good about JL is Flash (Ezra Miller) and the worst thing about JL is JL. The dialogues are so B-grade. The screenplay is so crap, it generates a script and expect you to understand everything from the trailer. All good scenes have been cut the run time should've been at least 3 hrs. Superman and cyborg are talking like teenagers. Bruce wayne is a stupid character. Joss ruin the Batman character so much that a thief can pop around batman while asking about para-demons, Batman didn't fight in whole movie he just running away. This movie is so stupid that it broke my heart. I am glad I didn't pay to watch this crap."

","Weak unappealing characters in a Universe that is poorly built. Instead of believing these characters could exist in reality the audience is left watching a movie about super human oddities go about saving the world. This might work in a comic book page but when the realism of live action is replacing the artwork, the audience should be expecting the universe these live action characters now inhabit to be believable.<br/><br/>Building on the Universe Christopher Nolan set up for the Batman Series could have improved the how realistic the Justice League Universe felt but instead we have comic book characters in a real world setting creating a Universe that just does not immerse the viewer.<br/><br/>Over all I would not recommend watching this film at all."

Then they hinted about the Dark Side, which was the greatest villain in DC comics, but did not bring in the Forever People. Lastly the big villain of this story was easily defeated with 6 punches and then carried off by his own minions.
As for the portrayal of the characters-Wonder Woman seem to be the only one serious about fighting for what she believed in, everyone else was in joke mode-by the way, not funny!

","I'v seen all kinds of different types of hero movies and tv series. Honestly at some points they are good, but when more time passes they seem to lose that spark what made them good. Watching this movie was good to a certain point when that Steppenwolf lost again. All those superheroes in this movie seemed quite plain to me. I mean superman in His blue costume, flash in His red costume and so on have never seem to change over the years. Same things, same gadgets with few new ones. While evil forces have they'r massive powers, hordes of mobs and so on and yet they lose in movies with 10 minutes. Movie length is somewhere around 1.5-2 hours. From that time 10-20 minutes is spent on defeating those evil characters.<br/><br/>As i see it is like this. No matter what power or what costume or what gadget any hero has they are 50x more powerful then any evil or evil with powers like god characters. While watching these movies is fun it's also quite boring truth be told. Same start with every movie. Some evil turns up and then loses in the end. There is that Avengers Infinity War coming. Might be good, will be expected to be good and yet that Thanos character will also lose because those heroes are overly powerful. <br/><br/>Honestly i'm getting more bored with every hero movie there is yet to come. They are good, well made, have some sort of story in them but in the end evil characters get mere few minutes and then end up losing.<br/><br/>I'v never been any kind of fan like comics, cartoons, superheroes or anything and yet i can't also hate them. Can get bored of them however.<br/><br/>As of movie itself. Well there where actually 2 new heroes i haven't seen in any other movies. Cyborg and Aquaman. Both of them added some new insight to movie. Made it a bit better i guess. Still while watching this movie i did not get any thrilling or funny feeling. Movie was good but lacking some spark to make it better for this review. Meh.."

I have complaints, but to hear it from every blogger with an axe to grind, you'd think it was the worst movie ever. <br/><br/>It's not.<br/><br/>It has a fantastic cast. The story, though not wholy original, more than sufficed. The action sequences are very engaging. And it ends on a note that makes me want more, which I think was the objective, yes?<br/><br/>Now to the less than great. You can most definitely tell there are two director's hands in there.

"j_michelle-20510","9","0","1","11 December 2017"," People don't rate fairly
","One main reason I don't read reviews any more is because people have strong biases and silly reasons to down rate a good movie, and it's getting to the point it needs to stop. We seem to live in an era where it's considered 'cool' or normal to follow the pack and throw silly dirt on decent movies. However, after all the ridiculous things I had heard people complain about in this movie, I went into the cinema and was not disappointed! It was a great movie! I had to come back here and make sure the critics didn't destroy this one. I even read about the superman moustache issue beforehand, and not me, nor my partner nor anyone else I asked could see it! I tried really hard and just could not see it, yet that was a major thing people kept bringing up. Another complaint people had was the cliché plot- what do you expect? It's a superhero movie, and what do superheroes do best? Defeat villains of course! This is true of the comics as well. Pretty much all Marvel/DC movies and comics revolve around 'bad guy wreaks havoc and superheroes save the day'. Speaking of comics, people seem to down-rate movies that aren't clones of the comics, rather than viewing the movies as pieces inspired or driven by the comics, yet separate pieces of content. Then of course there are the ones that just can't accept new actors in the roles they had seen others in previously (e.g. The Flash TV actor, Smallville etc.)<br/><br/>Right, now all that is said, let's talk about the movie: it was a great movie. It did a good job of introducing each main character and establishing how they fit into the team/their backgrounds. Whilst many people are familiar with these characters, not everyone is, so it was a good move. There are some bloopers, and lots of action making it an enjoyable movie for many tastes. One point I do have to make is that in the movie, they make several mentions of the fact that Barry is a genius, yet the words he speaks and actions he takes give the impression he is not so much."
"Markk-455-632687","7","0","1","10 December 2017"," Injustice League
","Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Man of Steel are my favorite films to date in the DCEU. Wonder Woman is third. Suicide Squad and Justice League will battle for fourth. Hans Zimmer's music is the first thing that drops this movie down a notch for me. The intense Man of Steel score was incredible. The music any time Bruce Wayne or Batman was on the screen in BvS drew you right in. It's all missing in Justice League. Go back and re-watch Superman taking out the world engine in Man of Steel, or re-watch the ""They were hunters."" scene from BvS. The music took those movies to levels that made you lock into the mood or the moment. The special FX are also inferior here. You can tell Zack Snyder didn't work on a lot of these scenes that appear in the final cut. I'm even more glad I signed that petition for the Snyder cut now. Truthfully, everything BvS was setting up just fell right off a cliff in this movie. The end of BvS had you fired up with anticipation. Justice League was like... let's just phone it in. Wonder Woman was presented masterfully in her stand alone film. She was gorgeous in JL, sure... but her character even lacked. Superman's return fell short. Batman/Bruce Wayne often felt without purpose or drive in the second half of the film."

I invite people to watch this film despite the negative reviews, because it is the first time we ever see these characters together. I think Batman should have led the group, after all he brought them together. I think he needs a better costume, it just looked too bulky for him to move around in and he is all about agility, DC creative teams take a look at the awesome superhero mech armor ideas for Batman on Pinterest, and also at Deathstroke the Terminator. Have the female, teen Robin (Stephanie Brown) with short blonde hair in the new Batman movie, she's electric! the red vest, black legging, black and yellow cape -costume rocks. I agree that the main villain's costume needed much improvement as well as the CGI (although Doomsday was all CGI and was awesome in BvS which I loved) Is Darkseid in this movie? even just at the end to tease us? What happened to the founding member Green Lantern? Justice League 2 must be made but first let's see all the other characters in their own movies. Aquaman steals the movie, he rocks (except for the Triton, it could be done away with altogether he doesn't need it, his water powers, strength, agility suffice). Cyborg was great, the actor did a fine job, we get a feeling of his presence throughout the movie keep that momentum up, along with Aquaman's tempestuous, wild, chaotic and unpredictable nature, it works wonders so does his humor. Superman's costume needs to be re-designed less of those bands on the leg, it could look like chain mail, smoother, I like the light blue color and it was good to see him, Justice League needs Superman. Just out of curiosity why not try him in a black T-shirt with the red and gold superman symbol and jeans and sneakers, I think it would be awesome to see him like that saving people in a city, a tribute to smallville's Superman who was awesome (not that the current isn't). Flash's costume should be a little less mechanical after all he's supposed to be fast, mercurial, light on his feet, isn't that what he's about? I understand some of the armor on his suit is for protection against friction and attacks, but the shoulders and the rest of the suit should be more aero-ergo dynamic, it should be something to see! think Lamborghini on feet. Wonder Woman continues to be a little too tough, lets see a friendlier side, let that charisma shine through and stand side by side with man, not judging him. I love Wonder Woman's magic lasso, I love her strength and speed it's amazing and thrilling to see her in action, gets the blood pumping. Show her in situations where she's putting herself in danger to save common people caught in the crossfire of battle scenes and their reaction, their awe, it's always fun and shows why she's the greatest super heroine. Have Linda Carter appear as ongoing supporting character, a wise Amazon mentor and dear friend throughout the films. Follow through on what happened in BvS, the post-apocalyptic world where Batman is in a desert, thrilling stuff it was going to continue in this movie,that was mind blowing and that is what Justice League needs to be to take off and never stop. Lex Luthor's return is greatly anticipated (this time more genius less psycho), the promise of Darkseid must be realized but with great care and in the hands of someone who is passionate about the Justice League for the fan's sake. If this means the Justice League 2 needs a little more time to be properly made then do so, get this script going, build on what you had in BvS finish it, Snyder's ideas were on the mark. Whoever Takes the reigns must be passionate about the League, the story, the special effects, the CGI as good or better than BvS. If Darkseid will be CGI he must not only look impressive, he must be impressive, a force to be reckoned with, and a story to blow our minds. The League of Injustice should include Lex Luthor, Deathstroke, Black Adam, Sinestro, Superwoman from Earth 2 (as a tie in to the whole post-apocalyptic world from BvS! when they get there the other evil League doppelgangers will be waiting!) and Black Mantis. I would really like to see Man of Steel 2 with the same and better intensity as part one, as well as Brainiac and an intro to the Green lantern Corps and the whole Spectrum war (all the different color lanterns because the whole history and story line is really cool). Finally how about putting Supergirl, Flash, Green Arrow and Superman from the WB T.V. (include Martian Manhunter he's great he's great just increase his powers and the new Green Lantern!) show to cameo as a Justice league version of another earth. You should also include the Smallville -Superman and the other Superman from 'Superman returns' appear to prepare for Crisis on Infinite earths, this would be a treat! This is the kind of thing no one would see coming and the first time something like that has ever been done. This is exactly what the League is about, situations that go way beyond what you would ever expect and challenges that go beyond what any single hero could ever hope to overcome. This in mind go the full gamut, have Powergirl make her debut and the Justice Society members including an older Superman with grey hair, original Flash with the mercury wings and helm (look at Alex Ross art for inspiration, make him look cool), a new Wonder Woman, the original red and green, blonde haired Green Lantern, and the Spectre (larger than life) to take on the Anti-monitor, someone even Darkseid will fight against!"
"good-decision","6","0","1","8 December 2017"," Why it didn't work for me ...
","1- Henry Cavill in slow motion is a HELL NO! He lacked the grace necessary for the motions and was like the Incredible Hulk with considerable clumsiness. The scenes where he would start an assault squaring his massive hairy chest and approach others with an over extension of chest muscles made me chuckle audibly. It reminded me of fat kids giving skinny kids a ""belly butting"" instead of headbutting. This is not the desired effect in an audience. My friends and I would laugh about it later. I think Cavill might want to learn some type of graceful art of motion like ballet or aikido or whatever it is to smooth out the clumsiness. He acted the angry scenes in a surprisingly unboring way. I always thought Cavill lacks the necessary passion to deliver ""wrath"". That said, I was not totally convinced but less skeptic of him. He and Lois alone have below zero chemistry and their tender moments are flat. I have seen this lack of real chemistry as a constant in Cavills movies as if he's too preoccupied with himself to engage in an emotionally intense scene. He hits a particular plateau that he can't go above. But rest assured ladies, he's as handsome as ever. He might want to fix those twisted teeth at the bottom row though if he will keep howling and growling in a close up taken from above. Blame the director. <br/><br/>2- Wonder Woman is offensively middle of the road. I'm sorry but I refuse to take her seriously when I can see the entire crotch of her knickers while she's fighting crime, and her butt cleft from the back. Both in close up and both centre screen. The script wanted to make her the gentle and loving glue of a team of rowdy boys but honestly Gal Gadot lacks the necessary charm to deliver on that. She's a lovely girl.. lovely juuuust enough to get the approval of the moms of little girls fans of Wonder Woman, but not that lovely that she makes a man's girlfriend jealous, and not strong enough to intimidate geeks and insecure people .. she's perfectly middle of everything and in that there shall be no wonder in Wonder Woman at all. She's supermarket quality vanilla ice cream. Eager not to dazzle. <br/><br/>3- Ezra Miller was annoying, boyish not in a nice way, silly rather. Bad acting and delivering some of the most irrelevant lines in superhero history! He tried to come across as the super fast flash instead his performance came across as anxious, pretentious and unsure. <br/><br/>4- Ben Affleck as the world weary Batman: Gtf out of here! It's not Shakespeare. He however seemed to be the only real person in the movie who had emotions that made any sense. I'm Batman's number one fan and let me tell you something; Batman has superpowers. His superpower is intelligence. He's the most intelligent superhero of them all. While all of them were getting their asses whopped by Superman and he was literally running them into the ground, Batman controlled him and got results without lifting a finger! In the comics Batman is a scientist with superior intelligence. All his weapons and technologies are his own inventions. His superpowers are intelligence and science. It is his intelligence that brings back Superman to life and his intelligence gets Superman back into action. It's his intelligence that brings the Justice League together in a first place. So stop disrespecting Batman. When Ben Affleck said that Batman's superpower was that he was rich, I thought ""No, he's rich because super smart and that's his superpower. Read the comics!! <br/><br/>5- Jason Momoa: He's the reason why I gave this movie 4 stars just for Jason and the rest get two more stars lol .. what a feral, raw, passionate performer. Shame his role in the movie was kinda lame. More potent scenes should have been written for Aquaman instead of him street fighting with a fork! <br/><br/>6- The Anazonians: They came across as not the most intelligent in the bunch in this movies. Fight scenes were messy and desperate. Why do they launch their weapons at energy and why are you not remotely ready for what seemed to be inevitable? The scene were Stepoenwolf flicks their weapons off with his finger says it all. Irrelevant battle. <br/><br/>7- Steppenwolf: what a waste of good material. Just telling us the story of that guy at the beginning would have pumped up the entire movie. Instead, Wonder Woman sighs and moans two clichéd lame lines about who he is and that's it. And as lamely as he comes, he goes. Yaaaawn. <br/><br/>All that said the movie is a good pop corn movie. ... you won't be blown away but you won't be bored either."
"CJFouraki","7","0","1","8 December 2017"," Pretty Good. Had a Fun Time.
","Justice League was pretty good. It was essentially like every other superhero movie before it with a few scenes setting it apart from others. Honestly, if you swapped out DC characters for Marvel characters, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between movies. So it's ridiculous they get different scores when they are of the same quality.<br/><br/>Dialogue ranges from good to straight up superhero awfulness (exposition and hammy lines). They've done the good ol' Marvel thing and crammed a lot of jokes in and in Marvel fashion, some land and most miss. Can't tell which writer is at fault here. Otherwise, the actors were all great as their characters and I had no problem with them. Really took a liking to the Flash and he was probably my favourite thing about this movie alongside Batman and a certain fight that occurs at the Superman memorial site (you'll know which one I mean when you see it).<br/><br/>The visual effects are excellent at times and are awesome to watch, and at other times are downright atrocious. Superhero movies tend to be like this so I wasn't surprised. Steppenwolf looked alright at times and terrible at others. He was a terrible villain. Straight up Marvel quality. Pretty much what I assume Thanos will be like.<br/><br/>Action scenes are done well, clear enough and meaty enough. They're exciting and I think Justice League has succeeded in showing a superhero team working together better than any other superhero movie. They all played off each other and used their powers in small moments to give each other the upper hand, rather than just having big individual moments for each character.<br/><br/>Soundtrack is lacking by Danny Elfman, but it is good however to hear the good ol' Batman theme again. The sound design was really good, giving that heavy meatiness to fight scenes.<br/><br/>Cinematography is really nice, and the editing is good. There was one really awkward cut from an action scene to a dialogue scene that made me wonder why they couldn't edit it more smoothly. I'm also curious if there is a longer uncut version waiting to be released because the movie gave you a sense of the characters, sure, but didn't really develop them. They were likable and cool to watch together.<br/><br/>Overall, it's another superhero movie. I had a good time because I prefer the iconic DC superheros of the Justice League compared to other superhero groups. It was cool seeing my favourite childhood superheros all together on screen. So yeah, like all other superhero films, switch off your brain, go in and enjoy yourself. It's like all the rest. 6.5-7/10 good fun."

","The long awaited DCEU Justice League movie has arrived, and I enjoyed it more than I expected. This film is getting critically panned and is under-performing at the box office. It's sad, because I was actually hoping this film would actually do well, despite everything plaguing it, given the surprise success of Wonder Woman. I feel that if this film had come out ten years ago it would have been praised as an amazing achievement, and would have done unprecedented numbers.<br/><br/>However, in a world where we've now had two Avengers movies, and Civil War, many people see this as a generic, by the numbers flick, which is a valid argument. I understand those who feel that way. Even so, I found myself having fun with the movie, and I feel there are some genuinely good things about it.<br/><br/>The plot is the same as the Avengers, so there's no point in going over it. First, I'll discuss what I like about Justice League. The film looks good, in my opinion. There are instances of sub-par CGI particularly with Cyborg, but overall I like the look of the film. When the action kicked in I was having a good time, especially during the climax.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck as batman was really good here. I always liked Ben Affleck as an actor, and felt he could play a great Batman. His character was just characterized so poorly in BVS. Thankfully, I liked him a lot more here. You can tell the events of BVS are weighing greatly on him, and is trying to make a change for the better. I also like his costume more here than BVS. His outfit was awesome here, and he gets some good moments and fight scenes.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot was Wonder Woman was also a plus for the movie. I liked her in BVS, her own movie, and she was good here too. She had some good banter with Batman and the others, and her action scenes were always entertaining.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa as Aquaman was okay. I actually liked more than I thought I would. I'm still not totally sold on the look, but I found him fun enough. Though, he did have his annoying bits. Cyborg was there for me. I didn't dislike him, but I did not really care much for him either.<br/><br/>Now I discuss the things I don't think worked about Justice League. Firstly, I'm not a fan of this version of Barry Allen/The Flash. I don't think the actor was that good, and I found the character more irritating than anyone else. I'm not even comparing him to the CW Flash series, as I'm not a fan of that either. In my opinion they have yet to get the Flash right in a live action adaptation.<br/><br/>The villain was there. He looked cool, but there was nothing else to him. So he's basically the average MCU supervillain.<br/><br/>The thing is, aside from Superman, Batman (sort of), and Wonder Woman, none of the other heroes have gotten their own solo film developing them as characters. Due to this it makes it more difficult to get invested in them. Much of their backstory is shoehorned in this film as long exposition. I know much of this film found itself on the cutting room floor, so there probably are more scenes in the movie dedicated to developing them. However, that can have the effect of making the film too bloated and unfocused, like BVS was. Whether you like the MCU or not, there way was the more effective when it comes to setting up characters.<br/><br/>The final issue is with Superman. Henry Cavil is a great actor, he looks good in the costume, and I think he could play a great Superman. There are moments in this film where the Superman as he should be does come through, even if it is little. The problem is that this Superman has been characterized so terribly throughout the DCEU, especially in BVS.<br/><br/>What's so weird about this film is that everyone is constantly saying how much of a selfless hero superman was and how much the world needs him, including Batman. Everyone keeps saying how superman is a symbol for hope and justice. Yes, Superman is supposed to stand for those things, but with how he's been handled in these movies, including this one, those claims are entirely unfounded. Even in this film Superman still seems like a muscle headed idiot who only listens to Lois Lane.<br/><br/>In BVS everyone, including Batman, hated and feared Superman. Not to mention, Superman himself does not seem to care to much about being a hero. He even admitted it to Lois in BVS. Even in this film he still does not seem to care that much. Nowhere is that demonstrated more than in the opening scene of the film, where he gives one of the most awkward and unconvincing heroic speeches ever. From that scene, and the montage that followed, I thought this film was going to be a disaster. Of all the DCEU movies, this one had the weakest opening sequence, other than maybe Suicide Squad.<br/><br/>Overall, Justice League is a fun popcorn movie. There are some glaring faults, with a couple being major. There are really bad things in this film, but the film as a whole is okay in my opinion. It's probably even my second favorite of the DCEU line under Wonder Woman, though that doesn't say much. It's definitely better than BVS and Suicide Squad. I'd even put it over Man of Steel (though I like MOS alright) because Justice League had more fun, was not as long, looked far more colorful, and didn't take itself so overly serious."

","In a World of superhero movies it's difficult to take these movies seriously, so, as a cinephile, i'm trying to watch this type of movies with the less filmmaking knowledge i have and i must say, that Justice League delivers an entertaining superhero movie and not the mess that Batman v Superman was.<br/><br/>There were some moments in the movie that the acting was pretty flawed and trying to be epic but at least for me was a little bit cringy.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is great and it doesn't bothers you.<br/><br/>The direction was pretty decent and i can see a lot of Joss Whedon material here, also some of the typical Zack Snyder visual look and the usual montage at the beginning.<br/><br/>For comic books fans is pretty great watching all these superheroes coming together into one movie and they actually have chemistry and charisma between each other.<br/><br/>In conclusion, i think this movie was good but not great, still, if Warner and DC starts to make things better, we could have a pretty good cinematographic universe and with the villain that appeared in the post-credit scene we could have a great movie coming to us."

"pouge162","8","0","3","5 December 2017"," Not so Rotten
","I have to admit, I was excited for this movie. I grew up to the Super Friends, was a fan of the Justice League animated series, so when they announced Justice League the movie, I didn't get my expectations too high, but still found myself looking forward to it. <br/><br/>When Rotten Tomatoes came out with their rating, I wasn't surprised. They seem to have it out for DC movies recently. Man of Steel was better than they gave it credit for, Dawn of Justice though, was definitely not good (except for the Batman warehouse fight scene, that was pretty epic), Suicide Squad was a little fun, not as bad as critics say also.<br/><br/>Without giving any spoilers, JL decidedly turned up the humor on this one, which many gags did not fall flat for me. The Flash stole the show when it came to comic relief. Aquaman has a hilariously ""heart felt"" scene that was one of the best scenes in the movie. When Superman returns (seriously, I'm sure this is in no way a spoiler by now) he and Flash have a couple of great scenes, and Clark and Cyborg have a great one also. Batman does his thing and is played very well by Afleck. And of course Wonder Woman is once again played great by Gal Gadot. The villain is standard fair. Has a couple of decent scenes, but other than that, he plays his part, as do his minions. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this is not on par with many of the Marvel movies put out there (I don't mean to play the DC vs. Marvel card here) but this is a good entry and good beginning for the future movies. Please don't go in with a ""I'm going to hate this movie"" attitude and go in for a good popcorn movie and enjoy it."

I've no idea what all the critics and naysayers have such a problem with as it's got great characters with interesting background histories who bounce off each other well. There are also wonderful action sequences with some fun moments to lighten up the tension and excitement - something this film delivers in spades. What more could you want from a superhero movie?!?! <br/><br/>People, especially critics, need to stop this pointless Marvel/DC contest - they're different universes with different heroes but both deliver in different ways.

"Robert_duder","8","0","2","4 December 2017"," The DCEU is getting slowly better
","I have been a DC ""kid"" for 35 years give or take. I have been a Superman fanatic for nearly as long. I have my comic collection, my Superman collectibles, and the love of live action DC films. Man of Steel for me was a colossal disappointment in many ways. Zack Snyder really let me down and butchered so much of the Superman I knew and loved and changed so much about him. The casting was average at best (Amy Adams as Lois Lane is the worst Lois Lane yet) and the plot holes you could fly a jet through. But it worked to boost DC's film universe finally. Batman v Superman was better but still had some definite mis-steps. Wonder Woman so far is easily the best film of 2017 and one of the best I've ever seen period. I still blame Snyder for a lot of DCEU issues so far. I was pretty hesitant about Justice League and yet felt like I've been waiting for this movie my whole life. One of my biggest passions in life was the Death of Superman story line and I feel like Batman v Superman underplayed it but there was some redemption in Justice League. I think Joss Whedon's rewrites and re-shoots might have made a big difference here. Snyder still doesn't seem to understand that for superhero films we still want and need depth and back stories and details that make sense. I am starting to see a certain style in the DCEU that in part has to do with the CGI which seems clumsy but then I have to wonder if it makes up part of the look.<br/><br/>Interestingly Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot take point on the Justice League as Superman is dead at the beginning of the film. Both are perfectly cast. I wasn't sure about Gadot at all until the Wonder Woman film and now no one else could ever do it but her. I feel like Wonder Woman was so incredible that she didn't get used enough in this but she was still great and her and Affleck have good chemistry that should be explored more in future films. Affleck is a great Bruce Wayne and Batman. I think it'll be a real shame if he doesn't continue in the role. He seems passionate about it and his angle works and he has that weary, cynical vibe that is very important. I'm still not sold on Ezra Miller as the Flash. He does the role well enough but he doesn't sit right with me in the role. There's something awkward about him and he doesn't have that same chemistry on the team. There are two characters I was certain they could never pull off and that was Cyborg and Aquaman (two of my least favourite DC heroes.) Ray Fisher and Jason Momoa play them and if one great things comes out of the Justice League it will be that both characters and actors are great! Most surprising is Momoa as Aquaman who actually is fantastic. He's bad ass and I could almost imagine a stand alone film and Aquaman is a horrible hero in my opinion. The chemistry with him and Batman is great too. Jeremy Irons, Amy Adams, Diane Lane and JK Simmons show up in their small roles. Adams is horrible as ever as Lois Lane (I would have stayed dead if I were Superman), Irons is fine but very underused and seems bored, SImmons looks the part but same as Irons seems bored and Diane Lane is good in her role. There seems to be a ton of complaints about the villain in the film Steppenwolf. It is weird that I've never even heard of him but he's a good enough villain played by Ciarán Hinds. I think they underplay the importance of his connection to Darkseid who would be the more obvious villain. He is a worthy foe until Superman shows up.<br/><br/>Artistically, I think there is some great scenes in the film. Not unlike Wonder Woman the battle scenes are very good but also very CGI'd but it works just fine. Some of the cinematography is also very good. The addition of some comic recreated scenes (the black Umbrella shot from Death of Superman) and the hidden spatter of Danny Elfman's 1989 Batman theme was a nice touch. Given the short run time of less than 2 hours, I am amazed they were able to make the film as coherent and fun as it is. The humour is well placed. The downside to this film and most of the DCEU in general is the story feels rushed at times and there are pertinent details left out for the sake of timing and we're expected to accept it (it's very much a Christopher Nolan move to leave plot holes and expect us to ignore them because he's Chris Nolan.) The addition of a race between Superman and Flash was great and I thought Cavill really stepped up his role as the symbol of Superman. All in all, I enjoyed it a lot and look forward to watching it again. It's a step in the right direction and I think a good thing that Snyder had to step down to allow some fine tuning. Snyder should step aside completely and let others with more vision take over. 8.5/10"
"www-afzala1","9","0","1","2 December 2017"," Perfect comic book film for the fans
","So I went to see it in 4D with my family and boy was it worth it, definitely watch it in 4D because it makes the shots look beautiful as if it is straight from a comic book. The story however was a bit cliché but still enjoyable and some parts understandable but some fans will understand, The action scenes were well done, especially showing off so much of the character's abilities, however the villain seems a bit cliché though.<br/><br/>character roles review: Batfleck - This is the third time Ben has played the character (Dawn of Justice, Suicide Squad) and once again he nailed the character that should look like and act like from the comics, such a bad ass performance, Batman is smart and gets taken down by superhuman beings such as the para demons or Superman and yet walks it of, would've got killed if he was a normal guy but he's not he's BATMAN! Also he doesn't get pummelled by random street thugs (looking at you Bale), he manages to knock out a few para demons singlehandedly. What's also great is the gorgeous shot of Batman in some scenes really stand out, so I'm hoping to see the solo film with Ben reprising it (begging you to return).<br/><br/>Superman - Even though I prefer Tom Welling (Smallville) as the definitive Superman, Henry was pretty good in this role, so I wouldn't mind seeing him more, also the CGI on his mouth was noticeable from the beginning, close ups & ending but you know what, I don't care because I understood the situation before I seen this film but what would've been better if they put a beard on him to blend in with the moustache and gave him a black suit then he would've looked great as a contrast of change when resurrected. <br/><br/>Wonder Woman - Never really cared who played her, Gal Gadot did good for the role although I prefer someone like adrianne palicki to play her, but it was good that they showed off her weapons and abilities for this film.<br/><br/>Aquaman - Jason did brilliant in the role and the suit design looked good as well, unlike previous portrayers of the role and since Arthur Curry is half-human half-atlantean, he's meant to look different from an average guy hence the strong physique and piercing blue eyes which made the character cooler than the classic version some fans remember from Super Friends. They also made the character very useful for the plot as well.<br/><br/>Cyborg - Ray did good in the role and looks exactly like the character I remembered from the cartoon (Teen Titans) especially saying the catchphrase booyah, though I don't think casual film goers will not understand his origin easily, but he makes up for it with some scenes he was in and he was also cool as well. The CGI was well done for the film as well.<br/><br/>The Flash - I still prefer Grant Gustin's Flash, though Ezra didn't do bad but he wasn't given enough development even though some scenes were funny and the slo-mo sequence was done much better than the TV ver, especially showing off the speed force he has. Also the suit is too armoured and his relation with his father was a bit rushed and I didn't feel that father/son bond compared to Grant Gustin & John Wesley Shipp from the TV ver.<br/><br/>Commissioner Gordon - JK was talented as J Jonah and now he's great as the Commissioner, no words<br/><br/>Deathstroke - OK this maybe a bit of a spoiler but Joe nailed this role and looked exactly like the comics, A towering white haired American assassin for hire and better than Manu (not that he was bad but Arrow writers messed up his character completely), he looks like he could go toe to toe with Batfleck in the solo film or Justice League sequel. I must say he looks really different from when he played Flash in Raimi's Spider-man.<br/><br/>Overall: Definitely better than Avengers movie (seeing how Disney is going downhill with the movie property), a gorgeous film to watch, just ignore the haters and see it for yourself (in 4D if you want), the experience is worth it and DC is doing great establishing it's movie universe. (I really want to see Forever Evil, JLA Earth 2 or Batman Beyond story lines get adapted in the future)<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","Spoilers*****************<br/><br/>I saw the movie about a month after its release and noticed the amount of negative criticism the film got. After seeing the film I really don't understand why. I personally feel critics are way to harsh on movies and just set their expectations too high. It was constantly being compared to Marvel film franchise where it shouldn't be. Marvel takes a light heart-ed comedic approach to their movies while DC takes the darker emotional route. I am a fan of both Marvel and DC and love seeing any superheroes come to life on the big screen. They stuck to the DC mythology well, while tying the characters into each other.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the precursor films to this movie then you will enjoy this film.<br/><br/>With all said and done the movie was very enjoyable, it had a very good flow between action scenes and just dialogue. The effects were outstanding, and the fight scenes were impressive in terms of choreographed and effect. I really liked the characters design, for example the portrayal of Aquaman, making him cool as sht, compared to wimpy one were use to seeing talk to dolphins. They touched on things you wouldn't normally even think of like Bruce/Batman feeling like an outcast from the group, where he see's himself useless to the team through not having superhuman powers. I thought that was a nice touch.<br/><br/>The one aspect about the film I thought was odd was the revival of Superman. I mean I knew it was going to happen and I don't really understand why they choose to kill him off in the last film if they knew he would be resurrected anyways. Most likely from wanting an emotional/shocking response from the Batman vs Superman ending. I just think resurrections are lame in story telling.They did spin some humor into the scene where Flash kept mentioning Pet Cemetery.<br/><br/>You have to stay till the end credits to see Joe Manganiello as Deathstroke. Woo!<br/><br/>Overall the movie was fun and I enjoyed the seeing the start of the DC Universe. I hope to see more of the Justice League films in the future where they expand the round table and take on Darkseid. I wouldn't take kids under 12 to see it, might be too complex for them."

","Was there in the cinema just for Wonder Woman. We could go on for the fact there are always more superheros movies than movies featuring super-heroines but this movie is a good start, hopefully.<br/><br/>The initial Amazons scenes were amazing, soldiers fighting, united, making sacrifices, they are just so overwhelming! It's a pity, these scenes did not last long.<br/><br/>The whole movie is just rather short given it has to explain, introduce a lot of characters, and then having them coming together to defeat the bay guys. Perhaps having two directors over one movie is not that ideal this time.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of ""justice league"" but the fact once superman comes in and defeat the main bad guy while his peers cannot even hold the latter down united is rather......does this movie aims to tell us: superman is above and all with his blessed superpower that other heroes and heroines are comparatively some kind of wall-flower when push comes to shove?<br/><br/>Anyway, given the great, fearless, brave Amazons scenes in this movie, plus they do not make Wonder Woman wearing a more revealing than her ""costumed-made"" outfit since ""forever"", I have to rate this a 8/10. Women do not need to be revealing to be bad ass."

"npygmalion-87906","10","0","1","3 December 2017"," Good adaptation
","Two perspectives: First, review only on the movie (Standalone): <br/><br/>The movie was crisp and true to DCU. Almost,equal amount of screen space was given for all the characters. The story screenplay was lucid. The continuity from one frame to another was seamless. The characters had retained their originality. Although Batman himself looks a little weaker physically, given the age he is portrayed and that the rest of the folks are superhuman, it is definitely a good logic to show him that way. Nevertheless, the whole movie runs on his intellectual genius, strategy and the muscle power of the rest of the team. The cast is perfect. BATfleck is great, Cavil eases in, Gal Gadot is steaming, Aquaman and Cyborg were just fine. Flash was shown a little weak and childish (may be the CW Flash effect). May be there is a back story explanation. No prejudice, we should wait. The writers and the producers have remained true to the original Justice League comic book spirit. BGM was fantastic.<br/><br/>Second, place within DC and comparison to Marvel: This stands out as one of the best DC movies so far. Given that this is the first movie where we get to see so many of the DC superheroes together, this adds the OOMPH. The villain of this movie is formidable. But this also shows that there is definitely going to be bigger justice league movies with mush bigger villains. The scope is huge. And the post credit scenes set the stage for the next JLA movie.<br/><br/>And being a Marvel fan as well, I can already see Marvel movies going down in class, content and being true to comics (like how Thor has been handled is one example). So, looks like a upward tick for DC. Some movie fanboys try to draw parallels with Avengers and say that DC is trying to fit in the parallels. But the comic history of characters beckons, almost all of the DC characters pre-date their Marvel counterparts. Marvel's were adapted versions of the DC characters. In majority cases, the DC ones came first. So, for moviebuffs, try reading the comics before concluding. Prediction, going forward, DC is going to be trending up.. it might be the reverse for Marvel."

","My review of Justice League well I liked it. I didn't hate it. I loved Wonder Woman she was bad ass, The Flash was funny, Aquaman was cute, Batman was okay typical rich guy playing hero and Cyborg was a bit annoying but okay. In all honestly Cyborg got on my nerves with the whole I'm a robot, my mom is dead blah blah blah be grateful you're a alive dude and shut up. Anyway the film itself was cool for what it was. I do enjoy a good superhero film but the whole Steppenwolf thing was a bit strange. Of ALL the villains in DC you pick that guy? Why? Was it because he was big and powerful? And what was with the three boxes? That was a bit weird but I've never read the comic so maybe theirs a hidden message I'm missing but I've read a few of Batman and Wonder Woman comics so I'm aware of the series. <br/><br/>Now I did love the special effect of the film BUT I will say this the whole stop motion thing that superhero films do was a bit annoying. TWe get it we're watching a superhero film we don't need to be remembered every 5 minutes when a hero takes on a villain and time stops. I really only saw the film for Wonder Woman because I am a huge fan of Wonder and she bought love and understanding to the film. Now the Flash was funny a bit annoying at some parts but he sort of reminded me of Spiderman in Homecoming when he was trying to understand the gadgets and get use to the suit. Batman was a bit boring to be honest but it's Affleck he's no Bale so I didn't really care for him but for what it was he kept the story going. Aquaman was hot, oh I know you guys are going to be up my butt oh she only going for he hot superheros, umm yeah so? I need something to look at when I'm watching a superhero film. Same goes for Superman both bad and good guy, if you've seen the film you know what I mean. And like I mentioned Cyborg was a bit of a downer and annoying guy. <br/><br/>Should you watch this film? Well if you are a superhero person then I say yes go watch it but if you're not into the whole superheros saving the world then yes you'll like this film. But if you're not a into superhero films then I'd pass on this one and wait for it on redbox if you really want to watch it and see what all the fuss is about. I'll probably buy it to add to my DVD Blu-ray collection."

","This is the first DC movie where we (finally) get to watch many superheroes together, like with the Avengers, but Marvel/Disney is still many years ahead, sorry.<br/><br/>The story picks up after the events described in Batman v Superman, where the seeds for this story were planted. The movie follows a simple plot: somebody evil is recovering some objects that will destroy the world, so the League needs to be reunited. The end. We get to see what everyone is doing before Batman starts recruiting them. Sadly, the way it happens is really flat. Nothing memorable (besides Wonder Woman, she is always memorable). We are introduced to three new superheroes: Aquaman, the Flash and Cyborg, but none of them gets to gain our favor. Aquaman is too much Khal Drogo for our liking. The Flash is the comical relief of the movie, while there are other better funny moments where he is not involved. And Cyborg, well, it's a machine. Period.<br/><br/>Besides all of this, the movie is entertaining. Gone is the style of the previous DC movies (sans Wonder Woman) were the story kept going at a really slow pace. Here the pace is faster and we get to see more action. We manage to see again the Amazons, but gone are the fierce warriors presented in Wonder Woman (and compare their outfits) and we also see the Atlantean, not as good as we expected them, more like some kind of mermaids, and we get a glimpse of other creatures But still, there are some good action scenes, specially towards the end, where all the team fights together against the bad guy, who is as forgettable, as the bad guy from Thor: the Dark World. Hopefully in the next movie we'll get to see somebody pure evil.<br/><br/>The movie tries to be more similar to the Marvel's ones, but still doesn't quite reach them. Nonetheless, is an entertaining movie, if only to see all these characters together on the screen, both the main ones as for the supporting ones. Just remember, the golden egg chickens are: Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. The rest is there to give support and create a bigger hype. And needless to say that the Trinity are the best thing in this movie, to finally watch them together and feel nostalgic and younger again.<br/><br/>Marvelers gonna hate. DCers gonna enjoy."
"Asuka-Fan","6","0","2","3 December 2017"," Best superhero team-up movie ever!
","Justice League isn't as great as Wonder Woman (which is ranked as the Best Superhero Movie of All Time and is a serious contender for a Best Picture Oscar nomination), but Justice League is definitely better than all 3 of the MCU movies released this year and is the best superhero team-up movie ever. Justice League has been compared to The Avengers, but Justice League is much better than The Avengers because: 1. Justice League had better team chemistry and team interactions.<br/><br/>The team chemistry was much better in Justice League, helped by the fact that the Justice League had 2 younger members (Flash and Cyborg) who were relatively inexperienced. So we saw a couple of good moments when the veterans took the role of mentors to the younger members (i.e. Batman telling Flash to ""save one"" person first and go from there and later Wonder Woman telling Cyborg to have confidence in his ability to find where Steppenwolf had taken the Mother Boxes). Justice League also had a good scene with Wonder Woman helping to heal Batman's dislocated shoulder after they had that argument. The Avengers didn't have any good moments like that.<br/><br/>2. Justice League had better teamwork.<br/><br/>Batman and Wonder Woman worked together to recruit the rest of the team. Flash helped Wonder Woman with the the falling sword. Aquaman held back the water while Batman, Wonder Woman, and Flash hung on the NightCrawler and Cyborg piloted the NightCrawler up the tunnel. Cyborg and Flash worked together to resurrect Superman. Superman and Flash worked together to save civilians. Wonder Woman used her shield to protect Aquaman from falling rocks. Superman and Cyborg worked together to separate the Mother Boxes. And Superman and Wonder Woman worked together to destroy Steppenwolf's axe.<br/><br/>We saw no teamwork in The Avengers. The rest of the Avengers just stood around while Iron Man single-handedly took the nuclear missile launched by the military into space and used it to destroy the Chitauri mother ship.<br/><br/>3. Justice League had a more formidable villain.<br/><br/>People say Steppenwolf was a weak villain but Steppenwolf was a much better villain than the Chitauri because Steppenwolf was a much more formidable threat than the Chitauri. It took an alliance of the Amazons, Atlanteans, all the tribes of Man, and even the Olympian Gods (including Zeus himself) to defeat Steppenwolf the 1st time. Before Superman arrived, Steppenwolf was tossing the other Justice Leaguers around like they were action figures and was having his way with them. By contrast, the Chitauri had no superpowers and were so weak that they couldn't even hurt or do any damage to the 2 Avengers without superpowers (Black Widow and Hawkeye).<br/><br/>A hero isn't a great hero unless he's challenged and pushed to the limit by a formidable adversary or opponent. Without Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker is just a farmboy and not the Jedi Knight who destroyed the Death Star and helped defeat the Galactic Empire. Steppenwolf was a formidable opponent for the Justice League, but the Chitauri were weak and no challenge at all for the Avengers.<br/><br/>Watching the Justice League battle Steppenwolf is like watching the Golden State Warriors play against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Watching the Avengers against the Chitauri is like watching the Cleveland Cavaliers play against a high school team."
"itaigeula","9","0","2","2 December 2017"," That's how a Super Hero film should look like
","First and foremost, that's how you do it. Not too dark not too funny, with heroes who do heroic things and fight epic enemies and battles. I stress this point because to me it seems that most critics don't understand what a super-hero film is about. The epic is not a cliché' it's a requirement. That's why I hated Logan - I couldn't bare a pathetic Wolverine whining all the time. Regarding the characters: Most are good even a touch cool, and I think Aquaman and Wonder Woman rule in this one. Batman is also good, but I really didn't like the Flash. Barry Alan is a really annoying super-geek who can't find the sun to know where East is, and doesn't bother to ask. The villain Steppenwolf was criticized thoroughly and mostly for good reason. There could be many reasons for why he's come: revenge? atoning for previous failure? but we are left with just ""I love power"". Bottom line, it's a great movie, with great potential for the future. And a final good word for Cyborg. The character and the his future are both worth investigating and are well described."
"gphome","9","0","4","2 December 2017"," Way better than some of the so called 'experts' would have you believe!
","I have been a DC comics fan for over 50 years and I cannot for the life of me understand why so there are so many knockers of this movie. It seems as if it's cool to whack Warner Bros movies, and most of the adverse criticisms seem to come from people who are just trying to make a name for themselves and their websites. As for the Rotten Tomatoes ratings, these seem to be be as a result of the same genre of critics producing the reviews. Okay, so rant over and onto the movie itself. I took my 13 year old daughter to see this film and, whilst Man of Steel marked a huge change in the way Superman was presented but was still a good movie, BvS in it's theatrical release form was sub par, although the DVD special edition atoned for this, in my opinion. So we were hoping for a movie with a brighter and more optimistic tone; and that's what we got. People who criticise the plot, clearly have an attention span deficit or maybe just one of a gnat. It may be that they are too busy prejudging the movie based on their biased take on Zack Snyder movies and a general dislike of praising anything worthy from DC/Warners. Ignore the skewed box office predictions, talking down of the box office performance, and derogatory comments about facial hair. This film deserves watching more than once - I certainly intend to! The final act should have had the audience cheering, but I guess people generally are more cynical these days. However, the audience we were in were constantly laughing at jokes and witticisms in the movie, both visual and verbal.If you are a Justice League fan or just a wannabee one, you wont be disappointed and Warners would be mad not to be fast-tracking sequels."

"mm-45710","7","0","4","1 December 2017"," Entertaining
","Entertaining is a very accurate description for this movie. It's not more, it's not less, just entertaining.<br/><br/>The story is as very standard one (bad guy comes around, heroes joke around, heroes kick bad guy back to where he came from), so not very interesting and it is very poorly told. It feels like the whole plot is a mere excuse to bring the five members of the Justice League together. The sad thing about this is that a couple of interesting elements from the DC universe got presented to the viewer in a very uninteresting way (e.g. the motherboxes, parademons), so JL leaves the audience behind with no real affection towards the whole DC universe. I think that's a missed opportunity. Of course, the root cause of this problem is that DC is trying to build up the universe too fast. They don't take their time to introduce anything properly, including the main characters (!).<br/><br/>Anyways, if you don't care too much about the plot, you get to watch a quite enjoyable movie, actually. The heroes are fun, they interact quite well. Each of them has his/her own charm and role in the League. Of course The Flash (Ezra Miller) draws a lot of attention, thanks to his humorous scenes, but all the others are pretty cool as well - especially Aquaman (who is the hero with the highest coolness factor amongst five cool heroes - well done, Mr. Snyder!) and Wonder Woman (who I hope will lead the JL in future movies, she's a badass character and at the same time the most reasonable in this chaotic posse). <br/><br/>CGI is mediocre at best, action scenes are still cool (especially the Amazons' fight scenes!). Steppenwolf won't scare you, but the apocalyptic pictures towards the end look pretty awesome.<br/><br/>The score is meh, apart from ""Batman on the roof"".<br/><br/>Apart from that, JL had two goosebumps-moments for me. One is the very first Batman scene, and the second one during the fight at Superman's monument (you will know which one I mean). There are a bunch of candy for people who love the (JL- and Batman-) comics; I have the feeling Snyder read very deep into the comics and caught their spirit very well. That's why I rate JL 7 stars instead of 6."
"residentgrigo","6","0","4","1 December 2017"," They said the age of DC heroes would never come
","The DCEU went through a strenuous journey in the last 4 years but it undeniably found a fanbase and all the set-up from the 3 previous films (Suicide Squad isn't touched upon in JLA) finally comes home to roost here. The question on everyone's mind is if this is still a Snyder film and it clearly is. Just look at the expectedly harsh critical reception People who (mostly) didn't care for what came before should stay home and a producer statement that 80% of the film can be directly credited to Snyder is how I mostly feel too. The camera work especially kept his trademark touch. Chris Terrio's script though undeniably got a ""touch-up"" by Joss Wheedeon. I don't mean this as a negative, as Wheedeon's trademark banter is mostly on point and appropriate in this particular entry in the franchise. These are the Super Friends after all and anyone who thinks that BvS would have led to another deconstruction didn't get that film's message. The film's humor is naturally derived from the characters, so let's move on to them. Batman and Wonder Woman were always liked by even the harshest of critics and they again deliver here. Gal Gadot brings the expected heart and people who only liked her solo film should consider seeing this one due to her being the deuteragonist. The one and only Batfleck continues his struggle to redeem the sins of the past and to fit into an increasingly fantastical world he clearly has little place in. The film further bothers to point out how underpowered the aging Batman is against both the alien forces and his teammates. Even his suicidal dive to succeed is addressed. It must be noted that some of his re-shot scenes are noticeably inferior, especially his introduction. Jason Momoa is the badass 90s comics Aquaman that made me a fan of his stories as a kid and the film's too short trip to Atlantis just reconfirmed to me that his upcoming solo film will blow minds. Yet he is also the character who was hurt the most by the re-cuts to get the film under 2 hours. The exposition heavy interaction with his fiancé should feel especially bewildering to viewers who have no idea about his cannon. Ray Fisher's take on Cyborg may surprise anyone who only knows him from the Titans cartoons but what you see here is also what he is about in the comics. I honestly didn't expect the film to go this broody with Victor and his CG body is astonishing. Fisher has quite a voice too! Ezra Miller's overeager Flash is my favorite team member and has the easiest to define character arc in the film. The film even borders on an origin film for him but it must be noted that this is the Wally West version of the character with Barry's new origin and career aspirations mixed in. So more or less what the Justice League (Unlimited) cartoon did. Superman also shows up and I overall liked him but the filmmakers overshot a bit with trying to please audiences who only know the character casually and were left frustrated with past films.<br/><br/>The film's villain Steppenwolf and his army are an equally complicated case to judge, as they were well chosen but the film's break neck pace squanders their potential. About 3 more scenes with them and a less one sided ending battle would have worked wonders. Especially if the film bothered to point out what the ""unity"" is the villain desperately seeks, what a New God is and that his hive mind cyborg army is what humanity would have turned into if Steppenwolf succeeded. And there we are. The film's lost potential due to the studio desperation to please more viewers than before. This desperation lead to sometimes very clear re-shoots and obviously missing scenes. Elfman's lazy and nostalgia driven score is even harder to swallow but at least sounds professional and the film's sound design is thankfully genre leading. A novel could be written about the behind the scenes drama, yet the final product still works despite these sharp edges. This adaptation is also a slight improvement over the source comic Justice League Origin and certainly better than it's messy toon adaptation Justice League War. I hope that a superior/longer version of this film will see the light of day but what we got is better than most could have put on screen and that has to be enough. Especially as I waited 2 weeks to form a final opinion after re-watching the film, seeing it fail at the box-office and seeing the cut scenes leak online. Yet none of that swayed me and my positive opinion still stands. I wish Zack and co. better luck and a less hateful reception for their future endeavors. They gave us comics fans so much over the years and I will remain forever grateful. May we join them in the sun!"

","Broad Reviews - Film<br/><br/>Minor spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>The long-awaited Justice League film, whose anticipation has softened after the bad reputation of the DCU's starting films, has finally come. Was it worth the rushed start and skipping the solo films of its leading members? Well, we'll see...<br/><br/>Personally, I thought the film was good. Miles better than Batman v Superman, but it still had a few problems.<br/><br/>In regards to the characters, Batman and Wonder Woman were good and developed because of their presence in previous films.<br/><br/>The Flash was really enjoyable during action scenes, but was pretty annoying when he spoke. He was pretty much there for comic relief.<br/><br/>Cyborg was by far the least interesting of the team. We're given bits of his backstory through exposition, but his character was so dull that I just can't get attached to his character.<br/><br/>Aquaman was the best of the new Justice League team members. He was really fun to watch, even without much depth/development.<br/><br/>The biggest let down was the villain, Steppenwolf. He had no characterisation whatsoever and had no defining motivation for doing what he was doing. Even his voice was devoid of charisma. An easily forgettable, generic villain.<br/><br/>There was one more character addition that I can't get into details about because it's full of spoilers, so I'll just brush over it lightly. It was great seeing this character on screen, but he only appeared about two-thirds of the way in, and his character arc was very rushed and could have been brilliant if it had the chance to breathe. Plus his involvement in the film's final climax just made the climax feel easy as soon as he arrived.<br/><br/>As for the visuals, they were impressive for some of it, but the CGI was very noticeable in areas; so much so that it just became distracting (particularly Cyborg and a certain character's digitally-removed moustache).<br/><br/>In the end, Justice League was an enjoyable film for a casual watch. The thing that the DCU needs is patience. They're rushing too quickly to catch up to Marvel, and as a result their films are suffering. They have the potential to produce quality films if they do two things: take their time in writing and planning their universe, and by replacing Zack Snyder (and let the filmmakers actually make the film without the studio butting in to take control).<br/><br/>Overall score: 7.2/10"

Superman - What can I say, all scenes about him is the greatest. I like most when he face the league members but sadly the fights ended swiftly.<br/><br/>The only thing that may be deeply lacking: Great musics. I think there aren't enough musics to stimulate audience feelings & there are even awkward moments that make me feel something is missing - the musics.<br/><br/>Thanks to the team that made such great effort to come out with the masterpiece.<br/><br/>Say no more, watch it yourself as I'm definitely watching it again & again & again & again ...."

","I consider myself as a DC fan, but lately.. not so much with the movie. We had a great start with the man of steel movie, got exited over BvS and SQ, and got really disappointed as a result, this movie is not rushed with it scenes, but it is in production.. i mean are we ignoring the scene with superman's casket in BvS? Or in this movie, are we really not getting anything from the bad guys with the bomb? They really seemed promising. There were a lot of unnecessary scenes, like the fight with superman, like he was ready to kill any living thing until he saw louis lane and talked about bruce like nothing happened?<br/><br/>The script was OK.. the characters.. not so great, we needed to see the development of each character, and most of all, how many years would they keep us waiting until we hear something about the last 20 years in gotham other than exploding windup penguins?!<br/><br/>The movie isn't that much a different with BvS, the comedy won't change the fact that it was really rushed, and i'm really sad to see marvel kicking DC's ass in the cinematic universe.<br/><br/>In conclusion: the movie wasn't THAT disappointing, but really got our hopes down for future dc films."

","The Marvel Universe is brilliantly successful, but the DC Extended Universe has been a mixed bag; Man of Steel was good, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was crap, Suicide Squad was alright, and Wonder Woman was fantastic, so expectations were high for this movie, bringing all the DC Comics heroes together, directed by Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen, Sucker Punch). Basically thousands of years ago, Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds) and his army of Parademons attempted to conquer the world using the power of the three Mother Boxes, but they were defeated by a unified army of the Olympian Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, humans, and Green Lanterns, following this the Mother Boxes were separated and hidden in locations around Earth. In the present, the world is mourning the death of Superman (Henry Cavill), this has triggered the Mother Boxes to reactivate and Steppenwolf's return to Earth in an effort to regain favour with his master, Darkseid. Steppenwolf manages to retrieve the Mother Box from Themyscira, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) warns her daughter Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) of Steppenwolf'd by lighting the invasion fire. Meanwhile Bruce Wayne aka Batman (Ben Affleck) knows the world is under threat from an oncoming evil, he is attempting to unite other metahumans to a cause to stop it. Wayne goes after Arthur Curry aka Aquaman (Game of Thrones' Jason Momoa), who has superhuman strength, speed and aquatic capabilities, and Barry Allen aka The Flash (We Need to Talk About Kevin's Ezra Miller), who has immense superhuman speed and time and space manipulation capabilities. Prince looks for Victor Stone aka Cyborg (Ray Fisher), who has mechanical parts, giving him superhuman strength, electronic capabilities and flight. Stone joins when his father Silas (Joe Morton) is kidnapped, along with S.T.A.R. Labs (Scientific and Technological Advanced Research Labs) employees, by Steppenwolf looking for the Mother Boxes. Curry takes action and joins the cause, when Steppenwolf attacks Atlantis to retrieve the next Mother Box. Commissioner James Gordon (J.K. Simmons) tells the team the Steppenwolf's Army are based in an abandoned facility under Gotham Harbor, they are able to rescue the kidnapped employees, but the facility is flooded during the combat, the team escape when Curry delays the flood. Stone retrieves the last Mother Box, it was hidden from the group for analysis, Stone reveals that his father used the Mother Box to rebuild Stone's body after a life-threatening accident. Wayne decides that the Mother Box should be used to resurrect Superman, both to help defeat Steppenholf, and to restore hope to mankind, Prince and Curry are hesitant about the idea, but Wayne has a secret contingency plan in case Superman returns as a nemesis. Clark Kent's body is exhumed from his grave, he is placed in the waters of the Kryptonian ship alongside the Mother Box, it is successfully activated and Superman is resurrected, however his memories have not returned, he attacks the group after stone accidentally fires a projectile at him. On the verge of being killed, Batman enacts his contingency plan: Lois Lane (Amy Adams), Superman calms down seeing her, he leaves with her and returns to his family home in Smallville, there he recovers and tries to recover his memories. The final Mother Box is unguarded, allowing Steppenwolf to easily retrieve it, the five heroes, unaided by Superman, travel to a village in Russia where Steppenwolf plans to unite the boxes together and reshape the world. The team fights their way through the Parademons to reach Steppenwolf, but they are unable to distract him long enough for Stone to separate the boxes. Superman arrives, he aids Allen with the evacuation of the citizens, then assists Stone in the separation of the Mother Boxes, Steppenwolf is defeated by the group, as he is overcome with fear, and attacked by his own Parademons, before they are all teleported away. In the aftermath of the battle, Wayne and Prince agree to rebuild Wayne Manor as an operations base for the team, with additional space for more heroes; Prince steps out in public as a hero; Allen gets a job in Central City's police department, impressing his father Henry (Billy Crudup), serving time in prison; Stone continues to explore and enhance his abilities with his father; Curry returns to Atlantis; and Superman returns to the Daily Planet as Clark Kent. In the post-credits, Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) has escaped from Arkham Asylum and recruits Slade Wilson aka Deathstroke (Joe Manganiello) to form their own league. Also starring Jeremy Irons as Alfred, Amber Heard as Mera, Robin Wright as Antiope, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson as Mayor and Sergi Constance as Zeus. Affleck is better this time as the Dark Knight, Cavill makes a fairly welcome return as the Man of Steel, Gadot still kicks ass as the main heroine, and the other superhero recruits do their parts as well. To be honest, it is not the most original story, it is a very simple plot, villain wants to destroy and reform the Earth, the heroes band together and have to stop him, pretty simple, but at least the fight sequences and special effects are nothing to complain about, a predictable but alright superhero action movie. Worth watching!"

","Over the last two weeks, I've been reading hideous reviews about this movie. They said it was a flop, they said WarnerBros missed the point, they said the movie had only a couple of worthy moments. What I watched in the cinema was very different. Yes, it's not a candidate for movie of the year and it could have been a lot better. It's a Zack Snyder film (we all know his way of doing things) but it's definitely an improvement compared to Dawn of Justice. <br/><br/>Its tone is lighter, Gadot and the new characters are fun to watch and Ben Affleck is giving another solid performance as Bruce Wayne, I'm not sure about the Batman stuff but when it comes to Bruce, he's the best.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie is its running time. It's short and that's good. It makes things fast and interesting. You won't leave the movie theatre disappointed, that's for sure."
"javi-y-se-acabo","5","0","1","30 November 2017"," Chaotic But Entertaining Mess
","Justice League is the expected reunion of some of DC's most loved characters, but its post-production has been really chaotic and messy, and that is reflected in the movie. Zack Snyder had to left the movie because of a familiar tragedy and that brought Joss Whedon on board, who did a great amount of the shots, changed the tone of the movie overall and did other changes. The final movie is far away of what I would loved it to be, but to watch all of those heroes together on screen is just wonderful.<br/><br/>This movies tells us the story of how Bruce Wayne is trying to reunite a team for fighting against the forces of evil that are menacing the Earth. I like the way the story is told and I really like the idea of Bruce reuniting the League. My main problem is that the movie does not have time to set up really well all the secondary characters (Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg, not to mention the villain, Steppenwolf). The movie is so rushed that they are just introduced, given a bit of backstory, and that's it. I think this movie should have been longer just for given those characters and interesting background that would have make them more likable. <br/><br/>Anyway, the actors are really great in their roles. Ben Affleck as Batman/Bruce Wayne and Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman keep their awesome job from Batman V Superman and keep showing us that their casting was really spot on. I really liked Henry Cavill as Superman in the previous movies, but in this, I don't know, I just feel it's character was underused and he could have bring an interesting dynamic to the group if used more. Flash was played by Ezra Miller, Aquaman by Jason Momoa and Cyborg by Ray Fisher. They did really great. Their characters at times felt a bit like background characters more than members of the League, but that's not problem of the actors. And then you have the villain, who was the most dull and stupid villain we have had in the DCEU so long. He just appeared at some parts and then disappeared and he had from little to zero background story for us to really understand what were his main purposes.<br/><br/>The visuals were amazing as always, and at some shots you could really feel Zack Snyder's present, who might not be a great storyteller, but is a genius at creating powerful images. Although at some parts of the movie you felt Whedon (or maybe Warner) presence in the lighter tone (that was the difference DC had over Marvel) and the unnecessary jokes put all over the place. And my other problem is the music. At first Junkie XL was hired to compose the score but when Whedon came in, he was replaced by Danny Elfman. Elfman has a really great talent, but he decided to move away from the soundscape Hans Zimmer had created in the previous movies to provide a boring, flat and unmemorable score that is barely audible within the movie. Elfman is a really great composer but I was sadly disappointed with his work in here and I wish he had kept Zimmer themes from Man of Steel and Batman V Superman.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an entertaining movie, but not a perfect one. If you liked Man of Steel and Batman V Superman, this might be a step down for you (like it was for me), but if you're a Marvel fan, I'm sure you will enjoy this one really much."
"chevolek","9","0","6","29 November 2017"," Great movie but too short for a superhero movie
","Great movie even without Snyder's cut it makes a great film. I as millions of fans would love to watch Snyder's cut though.<br/><br/>The downside is that the movie was too short for a superhero movie, even more for a multi-super hero movie. It seems it was WB execs who made that decision and not the directors. Many of great scenes were left on the cutting floor which we hopefully expect to watch in Snyder's Director's Cut blu-ray edition or an extended edition. Fans are gathering signatures to get the original JL cut. So let's hope we get to watch it later.<br/><br/>It has great score but at times I felt I was listening to a Tim Burton film, I prefer Zimmerman's better for DC movies.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>Another downside was that people were expecting John Williams 'Superman Theme when superman joins the fight against the villain, which would have been awesome to listen to (people are expecting that here as same as for the most recent Bond movies, the Bond music in the middle of the movie). When the man of steel is brought back to life you can hear a bit of the superman theme but in a darker tone. You can listen to it in the soundtrack.<br/><br/>We were also expecting superman to wear the black suit.<br/><br/>There were funny and cool moments like:<br/><br/>1- Elfman used his 1989 Batman Theme again in Justice League. 2- A green lantern scene fighting in the movie (and dying) and we see the ring flying in search for a new Green Lantern which we expect to see in JL2. 3- The Superman vs The Flash race credits scene. 4- And the scene with Deathstroke credits scene. 5- The original Jimmy Olsen from 1978 scene saved by Cyborg (which unfortunately didn't make it to theaters) but you can watch it in the trailer.<br/><br/>Some of us notticed Superman's digitally removed mustache, I blame the entertainment news for letting us now, so we paid more attention to it.<br/><br/>The main villain, Steppenwolf seemed a little cartoonish and I don't think he made a great villain.<br/><br/>But even with these downsides the movie was a lot of fun and definitely worth watching again."

","I thought it was very enjoyable and could have gone on longer actually, I still wanted more by the end and that was my first reaction. <br/><br/>The great: - It is happy to be it's own film, whereas some big movies coming out now try to tick all the boxes of clichés and stick strictly to a commercial formula. - Great chemistry between the leads and the screen time was naturally balanced well between them. Unlike some of the marvel films, Civil War especially, where it is a constant, grating competition to equally show everyone being impressive. - Superman scenes were some of the best in the film. - Aquaman is portrayed fantastically here and was the most likable superhero we have seen on screen in a long time. <br/><br/>The average: - Villain could've been more threatening and tougher to take down - While the Flash was funny, maybe they could have cut down on some of his jokes to give a slightly more serious characterization <br/><br/>Overall: Great experience. The critics are way off here. It's not perfect but is still a very good comic book film and well worth watching in the cinema."

","Overall, I enjoyed this DC Comics film and I would recommend it. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was seeing Wonder Woman. Her film that came out earlier this year was sad at the end of the story. Besides remembering Wonder Woman's story, all the characters worked well together. Their teamwork is what made this movie better than all of the other superhero movies I've watched. The reason I am not giving it 10 out of 10 stars is due to there not being enough action. It would have been cooler to see more fighting scenes. If you watch Justice League, you will have a hard time picking your favorite part. The movie was fantastic! My favorite character was the Flash because he is funny. I highly recommend that you watch this film, especially if you love action and comedy!"

It certainly could be better, but still I believe it is far better than what one could expect after all the complications that accompanied it's creation. Introduction of new characters is quite brief and it all feels little rushed from time to time, but I think creators did the best they best considering the fact they had to fit in two hours of screen time. <br/><br/>Yes, the plot Is very basic, it is here just to give bunch of heroes a reason to fight something. Yes, it isn't particularly original or even artistic, but NO it isn't garbage. If it should be considered a bad movie then all the ratings of Marcel avengers movies should be reconsidered because it is Injustice to praise them and them hate this. Most of the aspects critics Don't like in this film Are contained in marvel movies to. So, this Is a comics book adaptation with all it means. the strongest it has to offer in my opinion Is a likable team player by well chosen actors."

"john-demetriou-jd","8","0","1","29 November 2017"," Very good film, but could be better
","OK lets discuss this film. Many people are complaining that it was not good, that it was too light, or not good jokes or any random assortment of complaints. The problem is that people do not accept things from DC regardless of what they are. For example, people complain that the villain is a one off villain with no real depth (just like any other comic book movie so far), I have seen reviews complaining that Justice League is too serious, other reviews complaining that it is too light. No seriously, people complaint about two polar opposites on the same movie. I have seen reviews from week old accounts with nothing else under their belt hating on Justice League and praising Thor 3. People complaining that the movie is too light, give out 9s and 10s to Thor 3 and Guardians of the Galaxy. People complaining that villain is uninteresting because he is a one off villain, yet give 9s and 10s to Marvel which has not had a good villain in after 10 years of movies. Let me give it to you this way, this movie, it's not great. It's a step in the right direction, with a story that is a build up for the future (since we have a cinematic universe), Justice League is united, with some very good performances from everyone. Now I will voice my complaints and things I did not like, but they might contain spoilers so beware when reading the rest.<br/><br/>The run time could be longer, I don't understand why people complain about longer movies. All Zack Snyder movies had directors cuts that included scenes that were cut to reduce the run time and they were all better than theatrical release. I mean quite a few scenes from the trailers were in fact missing from the end product. CGI, moments existed where the CGI was bad, bad blending of foreground and backgrounds mostly. But not so many. Also the moustache thing is an issue a very few scenes. Maybe its because I knew about it and looked for it? Don't know. Also I feel JK Simmons was underused in the movie and Superman's initial berserk mode could be longer. I really feel that there were more scenes that are missing due to shortened run time."
"qeter","6","0","2","29 November 2017"," Too much action
","DC-Superheros are more important than Marvel's. With the creation of Superman and the contradiction that a superior being has no advantage whatsoever, because he is more vulnerable regarding friendships and family than a ""normal"" human, a mirror of humanity has been created that no other superhero delivers. So I always worry with Superman movies. The comics can deliver the side stories of humanity. The movies can not, because the producers always prefer the action and not the needed affection. The cast could deliver easily - some few scenes show it. But the script does not ask for many. But this movie is a must to see anyway. Every movie that shows Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is a must. She delivers in a magical way - it is unbelievable how fantastic she looks, moves, speaks, inside out, outside in. I wish, a good social competent script for Superman. And a script with the depth of Logan:Wolverine for Wonder Woman."
"associates-47728","9","0","1","28 November 2017"," So much better than I expected
","I always thought DC had set themselves a difficult task in trying to play catch up to Marvel Studios Avengers. There is no where near the number of movies developing the characters as Marvel had and in my opinion the JL line up chosen for the movie contained two characters I've only ever been Luke warm over. So coupled with some of the less than complimentary reviews I'd read about this movie my expectations weren't great. Thankfully I was very pleasantly surprised. I thought every aspect of this movie was excellent. Casting was definitely on point and I loved each actors portrayal of their characters and the interaction between them and look forward to future stand alone movies further exploring and developing these characters. I also thought the story was epic in its scope. To me it made sense that it would take a threat of the magnitude they faced to bring such independent and disparate heroes together for the first time so worked really well. The special effects were amazing and I loved the sound track and thought it appropriate. I can imagine someone that hasn't followed the DC universe prior to this movie could find it a bit overwhelming (most critics I'm guessing) since it covers a lot of ground but if you're a fan of the DCU I can't see why you wouldn't love this movie."

"sheridan-turner","6","0","1","28 November 2017"," Better than I expected.....actually.
","I am not big DC fan but I always liked Superman......and when SMALLVILLE attempted to create a Justice league on TV it sparked an interest for me. So when I heard they were making a Justice league I was hopeful. I have to admit though, seeing these characters on the big screen again proved why Batman or people without superpowers, should not be fighting super villains, but that is another story.<br/><br/>OK, so......this movie was a good effort in the right direction. I typically do not like DC movies, because they are not fun, and they don't build any bonds between the audience and the characters. It seems that they rely on the relationship between the fans and the comic books. <br/><br/>Personally.....I like it to feel something towards the characters. Like hate or admiration......or some emotion. Usually, I end up feeling frustrated....awkward....or even irritated. And whats with Batmans voice??? Is this a whispering contest???<br/><br/>The movie was better than BVS.......and waaaaaaay better than Suicide squad. I did not like how they brought back certain characters. There was very little explanation....and nothing to do with the comic book explanation. At the end of BVS, the ground was vibrating around Clark's grave....remember? What about that? In the comic, and in Smallville......yellow rays of the Sun were his friend and source of power.<br/><br/>I hate it when movie producers or writers decide to add in their own original information that goes against or degrades the original story arc. Trying to simplify things for a broader audience?<br/><br/>Anyhow.....over all it was pretty good. There might be hope for DC movies yet.<br/><br/>I rated this a 6.....which to me means Highly Watchable."

Steppenwolf didn't make convincing film and it was hard to tell if ciran hinds wasn't playing e part.

","Justice League, starring Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa and Ray Fisher finds DC's greatest heroes uniting in the face of apokolips to defeat their greatest enemy yet, one that they can only defeat as a team.<br/><br/>This film has been a long time coming. Since the cancellation of George Miller's 2009 'Justice League: Mortal' fans have been eagerly awaiting seeing their favourite heroes unite on the big screen. Now after many years and the conception of Zack Snyder's new DC cinematic universe, the wishes of the fans have finally come true. But can this eagerly anticipated team up ever possibly satisfy the hunger of an audience with such high expectations? <br/><br/>In short: no. Unfortunately for fans a combination of studio meddling, a lack of understanding of the characters at play, and some of the worst CGI I've ever seen has lead to a sloppy, sub-par superhero film rivalling the mediocrity of 'Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice'. The film isn't completely without merit and the most dedicated fans will likely find a lot to love, yet most will likely be very disappointed by this outing. <br/><br/>Some of the characters here are handled fairly well, yet all in all the majority of the characters are plagued by poor writing, shallow characterisation and poorly timed quips: a desperate attempt to address the DCEU's tonal critics, leading to an uneven infrequent tone throughout. The high calibre of actors work with that they have, but what they have isn't much. I found the characters of Fisher's Cyborg and Affleck's Batman simply quite infuriating. Cyborg is portrayed as a hollow straight-faced version of his vibrant comic counterpart: why is one of the youngest most vibrant members of the team with the most potential for natural comedy being turned into something (no pun intended) robotic? As well as Batman being incredibly poorly written with seemingly no inner development as a character or inner turmoil of any kind: All further emphasising the idea that these filmmakers don't know what makes the characters that they are working with so endearing. <br/><br/>Furthermore the film's villain is painfully weak, appearing as if the studio didn't even try. Steppenwolf is the absolute genre stereotype of what a supervillain is: big, dumb and ugly. Except that should be a template, a starting point, not the actual character. However it clearly is here. If a film is only as strong as its villain, Justice League is an outright failure. <br/><br/>There are definitely some redeeming factors in the film however. Every scene in which the League sits down and converses is very entertaining to watch; The actors all have clear natural chemistry making their interactions a joy to experience on screen. Furthermore, some of the action sequences are fairly exciting and engaging, serving to keep your interest, and as previously mentioned some of the characters do shine at points throughout the film such as Cavill's Superman, who here is the best incarnation of the character as portrayed by Cavill that we've received yet. However again the film shoots itself in the foot, as every time Cavill comes on screen WB's abysmal attempt to remove his moustache is a complete failure and consequently a distraction that instantaneously removes you from the film: it's infuriating. <br/><br/>All in all, Justice League for me is highly disappointing. It could have taken hugely beloved characters by me and many others, and made something that truly felt like a film crafted for the fans. Yet instead, corporate meddling with Zack Snyder's vision as well as the film effectively being directed by two different people (Joss Whedon) has lead to what seems like a pure mess. It has its positive qualities and for the most hardcore fans what they receive here will likely be enough. However, for the rest of us we'll have to keep on hoping that one day this property will fall in to the hands of someone with cares about the fans more than they do money, that can make something truly living up to our expectations, the worth of such rich characters, and the greats of DC comics."

","For starters CALL ME I can save the entire DCEU you just don't understand what the problem is here... you need to listen to casual fans not hard core fans. This film has problems yes and I will outline them but overall I think people are just to critical when it comes to comic book movies. That in and of itself is the biggest problem. As to DC movies maybe its Disney who controls the media just turns them against everything you do. Critics seemed to have it in for this movie and other DC movies even before the first ticket was bought. <br/><br/>Lets start by saying Marvel Movies are getting boring... Iron Man 3 was one of the worst comic book movies ever. Avengers 1 and 2 seriously aren' t that great and Age of Ultron was nothing more than as the same thing as Iron Man 3 really. The DC movies are NOT worse or even any better than Marvel movies. Captain America 1 might be the single worst movie ever aside from Batman and Robin. Nothing can top that one! LOL<br/><br/>Justice League is fun, funny, great action, awesome to finally see Aquaman, Flash, etc. There is nothing overall wrong with this movie when you compare them to Marvel. But here is the problem DC will never be reviewed like Marvel so DC is going to need home runs like Dark Knight or a director that virtually no one would dare slam like Nolan.<br/><br/>Your back is always against the wall. <br/><br/>With all that being said here are the problems. <br/><br/>1) Villain was weak. The casual fan doesn't know this guy and honestly no one cared. Is it a mystery that the highest grossing DC movies all contain the Joker? What DC clearly doesn't understand is people don't pay to see Batman we pay to see the villains. This movie lacked big league from that perspective. <br/><br/>2) Boat was missed: Instead of having Batman do this little thing at the beginning chasing down a no one opportunity missed to cast instead a minor Batman villain. Wouldn't it have been better to do a 5 minute opening of Batman tracking down MAN-BAT someone you may never use in a Batman movie? The comic geeks would have gone wild. <br/><br/>Then cut to Wonder-Woman vs terrorist would it had been better to instead utilize some minor villain here as well? You're making Justice League you have hundreds of villains unleash them even if they are minor. <br/><br/>Look at Spider-man there was a brief appearance by Shocker. Look at Captain America there was a brief appearance and fight with another minor villain which fans went nuts for! So yes cast your main bad guy but why not fill it with a few minor villains that fans would go crazy to see. Opportunity missed! <br/><br/>Steppenwolf looked terrible the CGI was pretty bad. But why Steppenworlf if you're calling out the entire Justice League we need a real EARTH THREAT like Brainiac. Once Superman steps on the scene he beats Steppenwolf like he's child's play. BORING! <br/><br/>Let me give you a different version of Justice League... Batman opens hunting MAN-BAT and just as MAN-BAT is about to kill Batman Martian Manhunter shows up saves Batman, then Man-Bat is going to Kill Martian Manhunter and bam Batman saves the day. Batman meets Martian Manhunter and says your world is in trouble a menace known as Brainiac is on his way to devour your planet. Batman puts the Justice League into action. Then even they can't stop them and need Lex Luthor's help to save the World. Brainiacs defeated and the shell of his robot body is stolen by Luther and he created Metello for a Superman 2. Etc. <br/><br/>That is what the fans want... we want to get excited about the Villains not the SUPERHEROS! Yes it will be super cool to see Hawkman, Green Lantern, Doctor Fate, etc... and we should. When you make Flash Movie instead of over using Wonder Woman perfect spot to inject Hawkman. Those kind of Cameo's makes comic book fans go nuts. <br/><br/>Why is it DC you've made 8 plus movies with Superman and we've yet to see the villain we all really want... Bizzero, Brainiac, Metello, Dark Seid. We don't want Luthor as anything but a side player. <br/><br/>Batman yes we want Joker, but where is Black Mask, Man-Bat, Clayface, these are smaller villains that can make cameos that sell tickets. <br/><br/>So I guess what I'm saying is Flash was awesome, Wonder Woman is incredible, Batman love him all great... get the villains into the movies that we want to see and have fun!<br/><br/>I still give the movie 10 out of 10 because it was FUN seeing all these hero's together, and playing to the classic comic artwork, and yes thanks to Wheldon the movie was funny. <br/><br/>But make Justice League movies like this... the approach should be that you probably will never get a chance to make another so have fun! <br/><br/>Use the best villains and don't apologize! <br/><br/>Aquaman his main villain is Black Manta you have to use him because you just don't know if there will be a second movie. You gotta hit a home run out of the gate. This movie didn't do that."
"Lejink","7","0","1","27 November 2017"," And Justice League for all...
","I'm a big fan of the early Justice League (of America) DC comics of the early 60's, usually written by Gardner Fox and penned by Mike Sekowsky so this megabucks all-action SFX fest should have been right up my street. However I hadn't seen the preceding ""Batman / Superman"" or ""Wonder Woman"" movies and found I had a lot of exposition to catch up on, but I just about got there by the end.<br/><br/>DC has been trailing Marvel, I think it's fair to say, in the movie stakes of late and even though in comicdom, the JLA predated the Avengers, obviously Marvel's two group blockbusters have stolen a lot of the prevailing thunder, both in terms of critical praise and box office success.<br/><br/>I guess the big problem for DC is the perennial one, to paraphrase ""The Sound Of Music"", how do you solve a problem like Superman. The Man Of Steel is so all-powerful that you know that any team he's on really can't lose even if the super-villain the rest of the Leaguers are up against can beat them all to a standstill. About that super-villain, a giant cross between Loki and Thor (he even wields a mighty hammer) called Steppenwolf (rumours that he was almost called Iron Butterfly are unfounded), I found him to be rather unconvincing, not to mention unintelligible at times as he blasts and blusters all over the place.<br/><br/>And as for the individual Leaguers, well, of the newcomers, I didn't recognise the Cyborg character (wasn't he a Teen Titan?) and felt he had the least presence of anyone on the team. For me, his place should have been taken by Green Lantern, one of the original comic book characters - frustratingly we see fleetingly a member of the Lantern Corps in one of the massed battles with Steppenwolf and his Viking-like hordes. My favourite DC character of all is The Flash, now starring in his own long-running, very enjoyable TV series but here portrayed as a callow youth, just learning about his powers. He's used for much of the humour in the film but I prefer my Barry Allen to be older and more confident than this. Aquaman, king of Atlantis I almost didn't recognise as a long-haired, bearded, tattooed denizen of the deep who when it comes to the big battle scenes above water makes you wonder why he's there at all. Debate will continue as to whether Batman, a non-super-powered human even deserves his place on the team but Wonder Woman makes a big impression, being the group's second most powerful (behind Supes) and frankly best-looking individual.<br/><br/>Of course there are SFX galore, possibly too much as sensory overload is almost achieved, but the story is relatively easy to understand and those scenes where the five, later six, get to pose heroically for truth, justice if not the American Way, against the skyline, get me every time.<br/><br/>Markers are put down for sequels although I'd prefer the League in the future to fight against their individual, better known rivals, sort of a league of super villains but I hope the film does well enough to get the follow-up go-ahead otherwise its back the comics for me.<br/><br/>Oh and I loved the tag of the old Superman / Flash who's the fastest, after the titles."
"swilliky","7","0","1","27 November 2017"," A decent but standard superhero team up
","The heroes of DC Comics unite in an action-packed adventure that has a mix of tones but some eye-popping action. The expanded universe of superheroes has struggled with recent films doing poorly with critics while having some financial success. The most recent film was a huge hit that seemed to put the connected universe back on track. Justice League does its job moving the characters around and getting them together but a lot of it feels like something that was only half thought out and a copy of something more interesting from another comic book movie company. The action in the film was enjoyable enough for me and seeing new superheroes benefited the overall feel of the film to make it an enjoyable experience for me. Familiar faces return and a new villain adds action though often has poor special effects and corny dialogue.<br/><br/>Batman (Ben Affleck) uses the fear of a criminal to draw out a parademon, the footsoldiers of Steppenwolf (Ciaran Hinds). Bruce Wayne learns that the monsters are seeking out Motherboxes from Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot). She knows the legends and when she is done fighting off religious zealots, she joins Bruce in recruiting new heroes to help in the fight. Bruce heads to an isolated sea village to recruit Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) who turns out to have amazing water powers as Aquaman. Arthur refuses Bruce's offer so Wayne heads to another young protégé Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) who has superspeed powers after a lightning strike turned him into the Flash. Diana Prince tries to recruit Cyborg (Ray Fisher), a football star Victor Stone, who was altered by a Motherbox when his father Silas (Joe Morton) performed experiments on it. <br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

","27 November 2017 First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Justice League. DC strikes our screens again, and following the death of Superman, chaos is gaining the upper hand and Bruce Wayne aka Batman (Ben Affleck) starts to assemble a team to take on the newest threat. DC films are darker and more gritty than Marvel and while this may not suit everyone, I find them quite refreshing. This particular offering was definitely a film of two parts.....the first being laid out to give a back story to each of our superheroes and the latter half focusing on the team working together. All of our characters have issues and it's those issues that make them pull together and conquer their adversaries. I think my favourite character had to be Barry Allen aka The Flash played by Ezra Miller. Here is a lad who is very uncomfortable with his powers, he's not sure of his position in the team yet he suits up and jumps into the fray with no real clue as why he's there. You can really see him grow by the end of the film and assert himself as a real player and not just some tag along fly by night. An extremely watchable film which I'm sure will be appreciated by all ages."

","Never had the highest expectations for this film since the DC has had a problem combining more than one personalities in one as seen in BVS and SS, but with the critically acclaim Wonder Woman, I knew they have the ability to produce quality.<br/><br/>The highlight of this movie was Superman as we finally got to see the Kryptonian dominance of power; he had the shortest screen time where he managed to steal every shot. Steppenwolf was not even a villain; I think if Jim Gordon had the time and resources, he could have defeated the New God which displayed no sign of ever accomplishing his objective. Wonder Woman was great, as per usual; Aquaman was good but seem a bit under-powered; Flash was trying too hard with the jokes - like stop Flash, just stop; Cyborg was really good and I can't wait to see his solo film and Batman was Batman.<br/><br/>It was good despite having two different directors with their robust and distinctive styles.

"yrallabandi","7","0","2","27 November 2017"," Not very well made, but damn entertaining.
","Look, you gotta face it: Justice League is not that well made. There's a reason why a majority of critics don't like it. It feels very rushed. Entire character arcs were removed. In fact, I feel 45 minutes were cut at the VERY least. This movie has to introduce the Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman properly and still tell a good story. 2 hours isn't enough for that. We need 3. Maybe an extended cut would help. The tone was also quite inconsistent (maybe due to the fact that this movie went through re-shoots and was essentially directed by 2 separate people). And the villain wasn't very interesting. The CGI was okay though. Yes, it wasn't that good, but I didn't find it as bad as the others were saying.<br/><br/>That being said, I was entertained. The movie is actually fairly fast paced for me, and seeing all of my favorite childhood heroes on screen was immensely satisfying, despite the cut backstories. (Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE me some Marvel, but DC for life!) The chemistry shared between the cast was really good, and the shared scenes were really entertaining.<br/><br/>Also, the movie is, overall, much more lighthearted than BvS. I thought that latter movie was a bit too dark, even for Batman: Nolan's trilogy did better in that department. There's a lot of jokes in this movie, including more than a few at Batman's expense, and he also has a few funny lines. Weird.<br/><br/>The cast overall does a good job portraying their characters, but I feel Batman should have been darker, maybe around Keaton's or Bale's level. Ben Affleck does a fine job playing him though. I also felt the Flash was more focused on comedy and not enough on the other emotions. Yes, Ezra Miller was good, but compared to Grant Gustin in the TV show, he is not as emotionally well realized, especially in the scene where he visits his father in prison. Of course, he didn't receive a lot of chance to develop thanks to the rushed production.<br/><br/>Overall, while the movie is shaky, I quite enjoyed it, much more than BvS. I just hope WB releases an extended edition and stops messing with directors' work."

","This was far better than I anticipated, from the (okay) visuals, the way every character eventually ends up fighting side by side, to the character development for multiple characters they somehow squeezed into one movie. I honestly couldn't find too much wrong with it. And if I had to complain it would be about the CGI, but that's nothing to dislike a movie about. Of course it's not perfect, but going into the theater expecting a perfect film is part of why people are giving this bad reviews, that and for some reason people like to hate anything that Zack Snyder does. As for a superhero film, it's way enjoyable. Tons of action, great acting, and goodies any DC fan will appreciate sprinkled throughout. Give it a chance and don't expect a ground shattering masterpiece!"

"consumerbatman","9","0","3","26 November 2017"," A two-hour, live-action 'Justice League Unlimited' episode
","The most fitting synopsis I've seen to date is that this is a live-action, two-hour long episode of Justice League Unlimited (the Cartoon Network show). If that's your thing, welcome! :) <br/><br/>The casting is near-perfect. Gadot, Cavill, and Affleck already have proved themselves as their comic book counterparts. But Momoa, Miller, and Fisher go the extra mile. The Flash is lighthearted enough to remind us of Wally West, but illustrate an extremely young Flash who isn't even a cop yet. Miller gloriously captures the brooding and conflicted young man who wanted to die, and resents his father's decisions while still caring about him. Momoa's Aquaman has phenomenal potential, clearly drawing from the late 90s to mid 2000s gruff, vigilante-style Aquaman. But Momoa keeps both hands.<br/><br/>The CGI is no more gratuitous than any fandom-based, big-budget film that relies largely on sci-fi/fantasy elements (looking at you, Pacific Rim, Hobbit Trilogy, Marvel, and Harry Potter), but there are a few scenes that give you pause to wonder why they went with a certain animation. Hardly movie-breaking. Nonetheless, the settings, the varied color palettes, how each environment reflects its hero, the cinematography, and the rich score make this movie so vibrant, it should be difficult for anyone to criticize that aspect.<br/><br/>While I imagine many folks wanted more from a villain, that was never Steppenwolf's obligation, nor the purpose of the film. The film itself is about the League coming together. The League fighting. And the League lighting a path to a new era of hope; the Snyder loyal will argue this was the plan all along: construct a conflicted world that has no shortage of pain, despair, and mistrust... which will find the light with Superman's sacrifice, and the League's formation. And I would agree with them. Even with slight inconsistencies from Whedon to Snyder scenes, this film and its lore seem thoroughly fleshed-out.<br/><br/>Steppenwolf is a lackey. Darkseid will come one day, and the world will tremble. Until then, who knows? Starro? Amazo? Grodd? We'll see.<br/><br/>Stay until after the credits.<br/><br/>I give it, flaws and all, an 8.5/10. I found it similarly enjoyable to the Avengers. I would've likely given it a higher rating if there were more content."
"joeravioli","6","0","5","26 November 2017"," Justice League? Yeah, sorta
","There's a scene in the first thirty minutes or so of Justice League where the film's villain, Steppenwolf, attacks Themyscira to retrieve one of three Motherboxes. He pops out of a blue cylinder and, along with a squadron of Parademons, lays waste to the Amazons as they struggle unsuccessfully to keep the box away from him. <br/><br/>Man oh man, was that a great scene. It's intense, colourful, and truly harrowing. Snyder (or whoever directed that scene) instils the scene with such a wonderful sense of movement and terror as the Amazons desperately try and keep the box away from Steppenwolf, dying heroic deaths as the axe-wielding giant swats them down left, right, and centre like a swarm of flies. It's awesome stuff, neither exploitative nor particularly restrained. Sure, Steppenwolf looks like he went through too many CGI blenders and sounds like a petulant brat, but he cuts a truly menacing figure as he brings his fiery axe down on the heads of fleeing Amazons with about as much care as a cheese grater.<br/><br/>While the rest of the movie doesn't even come remotely close to the quality of this scene, it isn't a bad film. Not by any means.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is especially good. The opening shot, one of those awkward shot-with-phone-and-badly-acted things, admittedly made me cringe at first, but it ends with a child asking Superman what he likes best about Earth, to which he looks away, a dreamy little smile brightening his chiselled features. It's surprising how much depth of feeling a simple smile provides.<br/><br/>The rest of the first half, excluding the scene with the Amazons, is mostly forgettable, but I don't recall feeling bored at any point. The banter, especially between Aquaman and Batman, was truly fun to watch, and the action scenes, which could have used a little tightening up, were entertaining enough to hold my interest.<br/><br/>Of course, one can't discuss the film without acknowledging the fact that it was a bad idea. Marvel did it right: releasing single films highlighting individual characters, crafting them as human beings before (heheh) assembling them. Warner Bros, in its apparent rush to compete with Marvel, made the mistake of bringing the ensemble together without introducing them all individually, the result being a rushed, muddled mess of exposition and characterisation that ends up unsuccessful, both as a narrative and at the box office. Wonder Woman was successful, and I'm almost certain that a Flash or Aquaman movie would be too. Speaking of which, Aquaman is especially glossed over, although he does get the most badass bit in the whole movie (ICKY THUMP SITTING DUNRK Something WAGON MEXICOOOOOOO DUH DUH).<br/><br/>BIG SPOILERS FROM HERE OK BUT NOT REALLY BECAUSE EVERYONE TOTALLY KNEW THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN:<br/><br/>Superman comes back. Come on, who thought that was a good idea? We already have a crowded canvas as it is, now we have to sort through Superman's internal post-resurrection struggle. And to top it all off, Superman is just as invincible as he always was, showing up at the final battle and laying waste about as easily as he'd squat and push out a log. <br/><br/>The final battle itself is not so great. There are awesome bits, but most of it is a confused, poorly edited mess. There's no sense of arrival, characters popping in and out of the canvas without any visual aids to help us keep track of where everyone is.<br/><br/>Like I said, not a terrible film. It has a great scene, a few good ones, and not enough bad ones to overwhelm the good ones. I just wish they approached it differently (or not at all), tightened up the editing, and for the love of God, made it an hour longer.<br/><br/>I don't think critics are paid off. But I do think that Rotten Tomatoes has damaged film criticism in that it has provided film critics with a way to tap into the collective mind of their peers. It's difficult to go up against public opinion, especially considering that your job may be on the line. I'm not saying that you switch your litmus test to IMDb's score, because that's bloated beyond reason by the sheer number of fools, trolls, and fanboys plaguing every corner of the Internet; instead, I'm adopting the mantra of the trolls infesting the comment section on Rotten Tomatoes' Facebook posts: Think for your goddam self. <br/><br/>Or stop going to the movies and eat ice cream. I don't care."
"jaguilbert","7","0","11","26 November 2017"," Cast could be better
","The movie is OK because a good time of the story is to get to know the characters. My problem here is that the actor playing the Flash creates a silly portrait of the hero, makes stupid mistakes and lacks personality. DC already has invested on the TV character who for me was a better Flash - people, specially kids already know him. Aquaman needed more time to balance his presence, the lord of the seas uses few times his command of the waters - perhaps the battle needed to be closer to a water source. Most fans wonder why Green Lantern was not in the film as he's took part in the original battle against the dark forces, perhaps this would have required another 30 minutes of film."

"thisseatofmars","6","0","8","24 November 2017"," Good, but not quite good enough to stop that immersion-breaking ""God, I'm a grown man watching a superhero show"" feeling.
","I was worried this movie would suck. Not because of the movie's different directors, not because of the negativity surrounding BvS, not because of the sinful feelings I have when I see Wonder Woman's wondrous wonderbra: it's because this is a superhero movie and I'm not 12 anymore. I've got loans, man. I'm so busy with work I get guilty if I don't use what precious free time I have reading up on the news or doing one-handed pushups (or something. That's something adults do, right? Pushups?). I'm an adult, with a beard and everything: so, can I really watch a superhero movie and *not* get the guilties? <br/><br/>Answer, no, definitely not: especially with the Marvel movies. They've become virtue signaling romps, like that last Spiderman Homeburning or whatever it was it was called, where the only white people were racist, ignorant teachers or, uh: THE VULTURE. (BTW Marvel is owned by Disney, who also owns Star Wars (yikes) and Fox (double yikes). The latest Star Wars game, Battlefront II, has just come out, and you basically have to buy the game only to pay *real money* while *playing* the game to win. Disney's too big, man. Maybe one day they'll own DC, too: and if you have to ""pay to win"" then think of what other crap they'll pull in the future (or even now) and the Marvel superheroes start to look like tyrants, or at best colourful distractions.<br/><br/>But hey, I guess distractions are the name of the game. I have had a mad couple of weeks and I haven't been to the cinema since October, or whenever it was that Stephen King's IT came out (""IT"" being, of course, Stephen King's disappointment to us all). Seeing a movie helps switch your brain off and, oh baby: I was overdue. When you're overburdened and up to your eyeballs in work, you gotta switch off: pay nine dollars to go to the movies on cheap nite and watch explosions and car crashes for 90 minutes. So, come on Justice League, I'm an adult, but let's see what you've got.<br/><br/>Parts of Justice League are genuinely funny. There are good quips back and forth and the story and dialogue doesn't take itself too seriously, a sin the Dark Knight and BvS movies committed. The movie's filled with action (yay), the CG is all cool to look at, and I really liked Steppenwolf, especially when they were explaining his backstory. His end is somewhat anticlimactic and this is a movie setting up future movies, but it's not as in-your-face about it as BvS was. (Or any Marvel movie. Yet another Infinity Stone? Great.) <br/><br/>But there are still those immersion-breaking moments that stop you from really getting into it, really enjoying it, really making you forget you're a grown man who's got a job that keeps him in the public eye (kinda). Batman's suit has limited head movement, so he's got to do that Michael Keaton thing where he turns his whole body around (or at least at the hips) to see who's standing juuuust to the left of him. The suit isn't as good as the Dark Knight versions and not having Christian Bale in the role hurts the whole universe thing via broken consistency. And, when Batman wears his armour batsuit without the mask it makes his head seem, God, how to say this delicately: comically small. That's a lot of this movie: people wearing big shiny armour suits (the Flash's is too red, looks like one of those (S&M? No, M&M) suits). Wonder Woman's costume is the most natural looking because it's the simplest, so it's the least distracting.<br/><br/>And, to reiterate a negative point: Steppenwolf was pretty darn cool, but his exit was unceremonious. And if Barry Allen's going to announce that he's Jewish, can Batman be a Rastafarian? <br/><br/>Anyway. Does Justice League suck? Pleasantly, no, it doesn't suck: but it's not great, either. It's somewhere between ""just okay"" and ""pretty good."" It's your bog standard baked potato, with a small splash of sexy, sour cream.<br/><br/>But I'll tell you, I enjoyed it much more than any of the Marvel movies I've seen in the last half a decade."
"pbeyene","7","0","7","24 November 2017"," The CGI was COMPLETELY unnoticeable
","The CGI on Superman's mouth, in the beginning of the movie, was in fact absolutely noticeable. That being said, it's kind of sad that that's the part of Justice League that I remember the most. Nevertheless, the I cannot disagree with the fact that I pretty much enjoyed the rest of the movie. Seeing Batman, Wonderwoman, Cyborg, The Flash, and Aqua Man team up was thrilling to see. The actors and actress truly portrayed their parts well as the DC superheroes. Watching the team gather together to fight Steppenwolf, the villain with a ridiculous name, was nice to see. The film portrayed the group's difficulty with combining their distinct personalities into one team well. However, anything that had to do with Superman in this movie was absolutely confusing. His resurrection, fight scenes, and the use of CGI I previously referred to did not make any sense. After he resurrects he chooses to attack the team; he just arose from the dead so it's understandable that he is disconcerted. But lo and behold, Lois Lane magically appears and he suddenly understands his place in the world. He then carries her off to his childhood home that he somehow remembers. Yeah... that threw me off. The fight scene was epic yet weird to see. I honestly think this movie was used to revive Superman for future films. The animation was blatant but that's expected when watching a superhero movie. However, this fight scene was one of the funniest parts of the movie. Watching The Flash's face when he was detected by Superman was hilarious. Justice League was a pretty good movie, however, I'm unsure if I'll pay to see another DC movie in theaters again."
"mrithunjayan","8","0","3","22 November 2017"," Justice League – Arrives, still a long way to go!!!
","One of the much awaited movies of the year which had the most interesting question – Superman???<br/><br/>The most exciting thing about superhero movies is that we can envision the level of imagination of the director and this movie does justice to that! To have many super heroes in a movie tends the audience to think whether there will be enough screen time provided to every super hero and Justice League does do that. I would not say that the fans of individual super hero may feel great but won't feel let down. Kudos to the director!!!<br/><br/>I was pretty much excited with the way the movie begins, of-course with the Batman and rightly so. However, it would have been great if each of the super hero's were given an entry sequence similar to that of Batman. My point is that the entry sequence should be knitted to the plot of the movie and should not be a standalone sequence, which was the case of Wonderwoman's entry!!!<br/><br/>The movie takes its own time to settle and it is evident because to assemble a team of super heroes is never going to be done in a jiffy.<br/><br/>Coming to the super powers in the movie, my favorite is Flash, not because of his power but the dialogue exchanges between Flash and others are quite exciting. But it reminded me of another super hero – Spiderman from the Civil War – you will know what i am saying when you watch it on screen! There are bits and pieces of sequences between the superheroes which will tickle your humor sense and I would say it is in the right quantity and the director has not over done it.<br/><br/>Aqua Man, Wonder Woman, Flash, Cyborg – Perfect fit and at required levels!!!<br/><br/>The action sequences were pretty much similar to every other super hero movie but it lacked the clarity, especially towards the end.<br/><br/>Yes. Coming to the much awaited question – Superman???<br/><br/>Yes – He comes back and the director/screenplay writer tried their best to bring him back in a logical way. I would say, they have done their best and I am quite happy with the way it is.<br/><br/>I think the movie starts to lag again when they try to show the emotional side of Superman which could have been avoided. But I am sure you will love the portion where Superman resurrects and the action part after that. Especially the sequence between -Flash and Superman – Fun-filled!!!<br/><br/>Do not miss the end credits!!! You are in for a surprise (I guess)<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is interesting, exciting and watchable but I would say there are lot of areas that could have been improved to make it great, spectacular and awesome!!!"
"kevinconwaymurphy","8","0","3","22 November 2017"," An incredibly watchable movie
","Critics ravage the pacing, CGI, and villain to a somewhat fair extent. The pacing in the first half is at a minimum ""earnest,"" seeking to establish the backstory so that the rest of the movie can occur. The villain is one dimensional, with a motive of ""destroy things"" and power that's never reaaaaalllllyyyy fully defined. However, this is a fun and rewatchable movie. The CGI (moustache CGI) is noticeable but not bad in the scenes where you can tell, and you can't tell in other scenes. The plot is very straightforward, and the characters definitely develop a chemistry initially but also increase it over the course of the movie. The themes of the main characters and their personal motivations are well fleshed out, and the action is fun and easy to follow. There are multiple moments that will blow the socks off of even the most rudimentary comic book/comic character fan, and you walk out of the theater smiling and content with what you just saw. There are two after-credits scenes, the first one is enjoyable regardless but if you've seen any DC comic or read any wiki or have any knowledge of the CW/DC universe the second one is soooooo amazing. The Flash in particular steals the show in this as well as cyborg, and I honestly can't figure out a reason this movie has been so poorly reviewed. Yes, there are tone shifts caused by the shifts in between directors, but a lot of them flow quite well. This is a fun movie, and anyone above the rating of the film (PG-13) will find it a fun watch."

","Yes, while there are some big problems, for a JL fan like me, it's not that bad a movie at all. Lots of great action, team up was wonderful, yes plot was confusing and two hours was just too small a time for JL to come together.<br/><br/>Overall, it's definitely fun to watch."
"thebricks","8","0","4","22 November 2017"," Joss Whedon definitely improved this movie a ton from Snyder
","Very impressed. You can see how Joss Whedon transformed this movie from a Zack Snyder hackfest to something actually watchable. I thought this was much better than Thor Ragnarok. My only qualm lay with Steppenwulf, one of the worst villains of all-time, absolutely boring. His CGI rendering is totally ugly too. You can see that this film was edited quite a bit, but it's definitely a positive improvement from what we've seen before. Just replace Batman, try again with Whedon completely in control and see what happens.<br/><br/>I don't even blame the failure of Avengers 2 on Whedon. It was Disney that interfered and ruined it.<br/><br/>Well done. Improve Wonder Woman too, maybe hire a real director?"
"adean81","6","0","3","22 November 2017"," Review for Justice League
","Review of Justice League<br/><br/>Knowing some of the controversies that went on while making this movie and having heard some negative reactions, I went into this movie with lower expectations. Perhaps maybe that's the reason I enjoyed this movie as much as I did. There are some good action and funny moments that make this movie for the most part, enjoyable.<br/><br/>Having loved the Wonder Woman movie I was very excited to see her in action here. Wonder Woman is awesome! There's a great scene in the beginning that shows her powers and reminds you that she is a powerful fighter. Aquaman, while fun, was a bit underutilized. He seems powerful, but this movie doesn't explain what his powers are. With the exception of a joke about him talking to fish. <br/><br/>A character that I was surprised by how much I ended up liking him was Victor Stone, aka Cyborg. He gets some really good moments with Wonder Woman and has to deal with his internal struggles about being more machine than human. Very good, but like Aquaman, I needed more backstory about his character. One character not in the trailers was Superman. Wow, he's powerful. I don't want to give too much away, but this movie really utilizes Superman's power set and it's awesome. <br/><br/>Now being a big fan of The Flash television show, I was going to be biased no matter what about this new Flash character. He's a bit uneven to me. He's good in some scenes, too comedic in others, and ultimately has the least to do, in terms of power, among the group. Batman has some great actions scenes and gets to be the strategist of the group, and I just like it when he gets to use his cool gadgets. <br/><br/>While this movie does have a quick pace, that is ultimately a detriment to the overall story quality. The plot and villain don't make much sense, and some of the character developments have either been rushed or dropped entirely. Adding a few extra scenes could have fleshed out and fixed some of these problems. Another flaw is the CGI (computer generated graphics) in the movie. The villain should have been done using practical effects makeup. The actor that plays Superman had to have his mustache digitally removed in most of his scenes which is why his mouth looks a little weird.<br/><br/>The strong point of this movie is the team. It's fun to see this group of characters interact with each other and have to work together. This is not Marvel's Avengers, but it's not a bad movie. There's a lot of fun to be had, and some really cool action scenes. If you don't focus too much on the plot then you should have a good time watching this movie. Only makes me more excited to see Wonder Woman 2, if they make it."
"and-charalambous","6","0","3","22 November 2017"," Clearly not as bad as critics want you to believe but still not perfect! Still liked it though!
","Even though I am a fan of both Marvel and DC, I was a tiny bit sceptical when going to see JL! I had HUGE expectations since the day they announced but thanks to reviews I toned my hype down before going to watch it. Turns out, it is a REALLY ENTERTAINING film! I'll give you the pros and cons.<br/><br/>PROS: 1)You will most likely love the characters and their new more saturated tones. (Personally LOVED WW & Flash)(But the more saturated costume tone made me fall in love with Superman, and so did the character which is being made justice)(I also might be one of the few people that like Batfleck and still I think he could've been better in this movie) 2)Fight sequences are TOP NOTCH! (if you love battles between superheroes this is a great movie to watch) (Personally my favourite parts of the movie) 3)Finally, some jokes enter the DCEU (and to me they were good and some really funny) 4)The tone is lighter but still a bit dark which I LOVED. (THANKFULLY not as light as Marvel) 5)At least the villain fights. (I read that this movie has villain problems.... and it has, BUT still not as bad problems as Marvel has) 6)It was easy to follow and not broken like BVS... BUT (read the cons pls) 7)Finally, some after-credits scenes and they are GREAT! (Some of my friends were like 'but that's a Marvel thing' and I was like, I know a hundred other franchises that have after-credits scenes) <br/><br/>CONS: 1)At times, especially when it's a close-up, the CGI just looks terrible and cheap but I got over that. 2)I WISH it was longer than 2hrs. Definitely not enough for the characters of the JL to bloom. (They bloom but I wanted more) 3)If it was longer I feel like the story could've evolved much smoother and would probably feel less disjointed and less rushed. (I'll definitely watch the extended version) 4)The end of Steppenwolf could've been better but it was OK. 5)Superman was WAY TOO OVERPOWERED! It felt like everything was over when he returned THAT strong. 6)Danny Elfman did an OK job but let's face it. He is NOT Hans Zimmer. (Very forgettable soundtrack is the best I can do right now)<br/><br/>This was my objective opinion about the film! Overall, for me, it was a good movie and I had a good time at the cinema. If you like DC animated JL movies then you'll probably like this movie too. It felt like watching the cartoon which I think is amazing and gave me that excitement. I think people who haven't gone to watch it should give it a chance and stop listening to critics who were clearly ready to bash it anyway. I definitely believe that it does NOT deserve that much of a low rating on RT or Metacritic. Also, if you give it a chance, they could always fix what you might not like in the next film. I saw improvement and I liked it."
"rmnosky","9","0","3","22 November 2017"," Really Enjoyed It!
","I went to see Justice League today with my 2 teenagers and we all really enjoyed it. Is it perfect? No. Is it better than most of the critics are saying? Yes, definitely.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>The cast was terrific. They worked very well with each other. It did have some laugh out loud moments. I'm old, so I was thrilled to hear the theme from the 1989 Batman film as well as John Williams Superman theme. (spoiler!!!) To me, this was the 1st time I felt Henry Cavill was Superman.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>Steppenwolf, not because he was a weak villain but because they could have made him seem more intimidating. Let me explain, Steppenwolf is not as well know as Lex Luthor or the Joker to the average person. He's the uncle of Darkseid (pronounced Dark Side). Darkseid is arguably the most powerful being in the DC universe and the only mention of his name was Steppenwolf saying ""for Darkseid"" but to someone who has never read comics, he could have been talking about the dark side of the force. This could have been cut out because, rumor has it, WB wanted this movie to be no longer than 2 hours. The Flash (this is nitpicking) Ezra Miller was great as the Flash, this has nothing to do with him. The Flash is Barry Allen but his mannerisms and weakness were more in-line with Wally West. He became the Flash in the comics after his uncle, Barry Allen, died saving the universe. Barry Allen is a more serious character, where Wally West was more of a comedian. Also, it's mentioned in the movie that, the Flash's metabolism is so high he need to eat constantly, which was Wally's issue but never Barry's (again I'm nitpicking).<br/><br/>For those who will say I'm a DC honk, go look at my ratings, most of my Marvel ratings are higher than my DC ones.<br/><br/>This is a movie based on characters from comic books, if you are okay with that premise, go see it and hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as my kids and I did."

","I had just had the pleasure to see Justice League at the BFI IMAX THEATRE, I accidentally bought a ticket for a 3D screening. This was the first I have ever seen a feature film in this medium, I have always avoided it like the plague. I found the experience extremely jarring, and it kept knocking me out of movie. I will definitely view this one again in 2D, the way nature intended. Now I know all the stories, all the re-shoots. The rewrites, the CGI problems, the Snyder lynch mob, rotten tomatoes, Marvel bias and mustachio Cavill. And you know what I really don't care! That's not why I watch these films. I do it because I love the characters, I have read them since I was young. And this film is really good, it's not terrible as some people are saying. Is this a cinematic masterpiece? NO! Is it trying to be? NO! Is this a boring film? NO! Is Zack Snyder a hack? Certainly NOT! Is Zack Snyder going receive a honorary Knighthood for his contributions to the arts? NO! Does he want a knighthood? I don't know, maybe! But do you understand my point I'm trying to make, this is just fun, positive movie about people with people with super powers. It doesn't deserve anyone's hate or anger, it's a just a comic book movie. <br/><br/>Now to my actual review. <br/><br/>The plot is simplistic which is a good thing, this is a character driven story. And that's what truly shines, the characters. Each have a moment in sun, each of them achieve something wonderful. Not one character is forgettable or dull, each have there own arc. Some are shorter than others but when you have team of people this always happens, it's a acceptable flaw.<br/><br/>The editing is okay, everything is coherent. This movie moves fast, it jumps all over the place. It reminds me a lot of the rebooted Star Trek which did a similar thing. Again a team oriented movie, and it's not a problem as it's very easy to follow.<br/><br/>The action is good, standard blockbuster fighting. The team assemble pretty quickly, going into there first battle. The Flash has a great moment which is so beautiful, true Snyder slow-mo at its best. Something that should be enjoyed on the big screen. Also in true Snyder form there are shots ripped straight off the page, with the some more great moments given to batman.<br/><br/>The score is not really memorable, only the original Tim Burton Batman theme sticks out. The beautiful Han Zimmer scores for Wonder Women and Superman are present, but used sparingly.<br/><br/>The CGI is okay, I didn't really notice to many problems. Superman's face is a little bit of a issue but it's understandable, your generating a image over someone's face.<br/><br/>The villain is also okay, he really serves as a ""Mcguffin"" that forces the team to form.<br/><br/>The run time actually helps keep you entertained, as the story just flies through. I'm sure we will see the true Snyder cut one day.<br/><br/>Now the stand out character for me is Superman, he so good that I felt like I was 5 watching him. He encapsulates the character perfectly, like for a better word HENRY CAVILL IS SUPERMAN! He steals every scene he is in, especially when he first returns and he demonstrates his true power! Also the final shot with them all together is wonderful, the original comic book team on the silver screen for the first time. I'm ready for the next chapter, I'm a believer. <br/><br/>I hope you enjoyed my review, I contemplated my thoughts over a couple days. If you disagree with me it's okay, remember this is just my opinion. I am a single person voicing my thoughts, am I wrong? Am I right? It doesn't matter as art is subjective, which means formulating you're own opinion is the key!<br/><br/>But I will say one final thing, I can go to my local supermarket and buy: Captain America Civil War, The Avengers, BvS, The Dark Knight, Apocalypse Now, The God Father part 2 and Transformers for a 5 note. In the end this stuff doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, so just enjoy it as it all ends up in the bargain bin."

","The DCEU's track record is pretty lackluster if you ask me. Man of Steel was okay, Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice was bad, and Suicide Squad was garbage, but Wonder Woman was good, and that's their only redeeming film in their extended universe.<br/><br/>Zack Synder is a terrible filmmaker, only making films that have beautiful aesthetics over story substance. I don't like any of his films, but I will say, ""They are damn good to look at."" However, his movie 300 has both a good narrative and a breathtaking aesthetic pallet. 300 is his only good film.<br/><br/>I don't know why Warner Bros. decided to stick with Synder after Man of Steel and BVS both bombed at the box office.<br/><br/>Can terrible filmmakers eventually produce good work, of course.<br/><br/>Justice League is the first team-up movie featuring some of our favorites superheroes, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman all team-up to protect the world from the evil that plagues the world. <br/><br/>I wasn't looking forward to this movie, to begin with, however, I did want it to be good, and I did want to feel the epicness.<br/><br/>Justice League is fun while watching, but almost none of it is memorable.<br/><br/>I had a blast during a majority of the action scenes, but none of them stick out to me. If you were to ask me what was my favorite action scene, I would say, ""They all felt the same, except for the man in the red cape, I like what they did with him here."" <br/><br/>The story amongst the characters is thin, Aquaman, and The Flash get the short end of the stick. Cyborg's story development has the impact unlike his co-stars, but he doesn't have any layers added to his character.<br/><br/>Aquaman is dull and typical, but Jason Momoa did make the experience fun.<br/><br/>The Flash was fun to watch, but his story was dull and predictable. <br/><br/>We already know who Batman and Wonder Woman are and so they don't need an introduction.<br/><br/>Overall, I didn't care about the plot. The character's stories were razor thin. The action was forgettable. The villain was $hit. The CGI was terrible. <br/><br/>I loved all of The Man in the Red Cape scenes.

","Just saw the movie and here's the main non-spoiler summary of things to take from it;<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/><ul><li>It was better than BvS. Much more of a complete film, and with better pacing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I never minded Ben as Batman, I was indifferent about the choice as there were bigger problems with BvS that kept my focus, but I like him now. He's kind of like the Daniel Craig of Batman's, and I think he's going to grow a lot on people. When you see him now you just don't wanna mess with him, like the dude's made of pure muscle and looks very imposing, but is also imperfect. He's definitely a very different Batman than the one we know from The Dark Knight, and I know not everyone's going to like him, he's not as mysterious or serious, but he's still very much a leader figure. He may not be your idea of a Batman, but he's not a drag.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Had a few ""whoa that was cool! I didn't know that! Oh man those are some cool hints, I can't wait to see where they go."" moments.</li></ul><br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/><ul><li>Definitely missing the weight of the solo films. There's character content here and it's enjoyable, but it's missing our understanding of the characters completely so we're just going off of what we already know about these characters from seeing them elsewhere as well as filling in the stereotypes. If we had more character knowledge to work from, I think we would've been able to connect to them and the movie more.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>THAT GODDAMNED CGI MOUTH! My God it's SO distracting! If they didn't like what was there, they should've just done a pickup where someone says ""oh and by the way, you should really shave"", and just left it at that. Like honestly, a moustache wouldn't have been the end of the world, and would've definitely been better than what we saw there.</li></ul><br/><br/>Final note: Wait for the extended cut. What they had was mostly complete, but there were a couple of strangely cut moments that you know the extended cut is going to resolve, just like it did with BvS, so wait for it.<br/><br/>My final score; 6/10. But I think that the extended cut will bump it up to 7/10, right on par with my score for WW."

Aquaman steals the movie in every scene hes in but the Flash on the other hand is annoying, and completely out of character.

I did enjoy the resurrection of Superman though, and how he flipped Bruces' ""Do you bleed?!"" comment on him this time around. That was pretty cool. Glad I only payed 5 bucks since it was my local theater's bargain night when I went to see it yesterday. Very disappointed since Suicide Squad was so awesome and had high hopes for this one.<br/><br/>I recommend waiting until Redbox or Netflix for this one.

"jordanthomas_2009-346-914758","6","0","2","22 November 2017"," It isn't terrible. But it isn't good.
","One thing that makes DC different from the others is that they are dark, gritty and often realistic. However Justice League takes the friendly lighthearted approach in hopes of following the Marvel formula. In doing so it lacks any emotional heft or tension. Also with only Superman and Wonder Woman having their own standalone movies, its very obvious DC are eager to keep up with Marvel. <br/><br/>However it is less gloomy than Batman v Superman and it doesn't drag on as much. The story feels more focused and a lot less cluttered with no set up to other instalments. Izla Miller and Jason Mamoa are good in their roles as Flash and Aquaman, they are easily the best characters who could have done with their own standalone films. Ray Fisher as Cyborg is OK, he does have a good story arc as half man/half machine, however he doesn't contribute to the team much, he just reads files and fixes things.<br/><br/>Some of the action scenes are enjoyable including Wonder Woman foiling a terrorist attack and the team fighting Superman; But most of it is forgettable. Danny Elfmans score isn't bad, with nods to Batman (1989) and Superman (1978). Unfortunately the plot is very thin and lacks any originality or logic. It revolves around super-villain Steppenwolf chasing down three cubes in order to rebuild the earth. This prompts Batman/Bruce Wayne to bring together his super-team and eventually bring Superman/Clark Kent back from the dead. Steppenwolf is a boring villain who lacks any substance. He doesn't do anything but talk tough and punch things, he just leaves his disposable insect minions to do most the work. <br/><br/>There is never a sense of real danger as no one ever gets hurt, except only at the beginning involving the Amazonians protecting the first cube. But from then on, there is only one or two civilian casualties and a few minor injuries here and there. When it finally comes to the finale, it is cliché and generic. It literally just feels like a rehash of X-Men Apocalypse. <br/><br/>Ben Affleck isn't given much to do this time, he just looks bored which is a major disappointment as he was easily the best thing about Batman v Superman. Gal Gadot looks to be slowly loosing enthusiasm playing Wonder Woman too. At this point its only the new members who seem to be enjoying themselves. <br/><br/>Midway through Post-Production, Director Zack Snyder had to quit because of a family tragedy leaving Joss Whedon (director of The Avengers) to finish the job. This included filming re-shoots and finishing visual effects shots, all in the space of a few months. This results in the film looking very cheap, the visual effects are often lacklustre with many of the scenes being shot on obvious green screens. Its no wonder WB delayed the reviews, its as if they already knew it was doomed. <br/><br/>Overall Justice League is OK to pass the time. But there is just too many characters who are given too little to do. Yes it is enjoyable in parts, but Its nothing special, its not the worse film ever made, but it should have been A lot better given the $300 million budget and cast."

","When Justice League first came out I was getting a little worried about how the movie would be as a result of the bad Rotten Tomatoes score and the poor box office figures. This didn't stop me from going to see the movie though and it shouldn't stop you! Justice League delivered exactly what it needed to deliver. It was fun, action packed, and it got the League together. It was what I wanted in a super hero movie. <br/><br/>The rest of this review may have minor spoilers so please stop here if you don't want to here anything specific about the movie. <br/><br/>One of the biggest things I have heard people complain about in Justice League is the villain. People have complained about him not being a strong enough (or scary enough) villain. I would say don't listen to this banter. You need to realize why the villain was the way he was. Yes, it is true that there was no real point in the movie that I was thinking ""Oh no! They may not win this thing!"" But, you know what? This wasn't the movie for that type of villain! DC needed to kick off the League by showing that if they came together they would be LEGIT and they would be powerful! Steppenwolf was the perfect bad guy because without the league together he would have won, but the moment they united he had no chance at all! I was glad at this fact. <br/><br/>The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because of small CGI decisions that could have been done better. As a result of re-shooting and the time line, some of the scenes had to be completed quickly and as a result a few places in the movie had sloppy CGI (i.e. the removal of Henry Cavill's mustache). However, this didn't really distract much from the movie and is only a minor detail. <br/><br/>Overall, Justice League was an awesome movie and I will see it again. The characters were all awesome (especially Superman, who was definitely done right this time). I hope that the DCU continues going in this direction because they are starting to get things right. If nothing else, they left me wanting more. I want more solo movies (with the actors that have been chosen), so that they can go further into their stories and I definitely want to see this team go up against Darkseid and other ""Big Bads"" in the future."

","I liked this movie, it was pretty good. I can understand some of the criticism, but honestly, it feels like this film is getting more hate than it deserves. For starters I liked all the hero's, even cyborg (the one character I expected to dislike the most). Gal Gadot was awesome as Wonder woman, Ben Affleck ""Killed it"" it as Batman, Jason Momoa played an bold and compelling Aquaman, and Ezra miller was great as the flash. The actors had such great chemistry and their overall portrayal of the characters was amusing. Some people might complain that Superman was ""too overpowered"" in the film, but remember, this is the same guy that stood in battle against doomsday, and took a nuke to the face. I mean who would you expect to go toe-to-toe with Darkseid and other galactic-level threats.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about the movie, was the ending. It did feel a bit too short, and the final battle felt like it was lacking a bit. I liked Steppenwolf through out most of the film (especially, the beginning parts), but towards the end he looked really weak. I really hoped that he'd be a much bigger threat, and that the movie would go on a bit longer (like 40 more minutes). In conclusion it was a pretty good movie and I can't wait to see the injustice league in the future. No they're not gonna be called legion of doom (that's lame)"

The erasure of the events is done so clumsily that any potential consequences are immediately resolved within minutes, pretty much leaving the audience like ""What? That's It?""<br/><br/>Following the idea of undoing the events of Batman vs Superman, it could've created interesting villains. However, Justice League opts for the 'safe' villain - a textbook villain that isn't impressionable, but can do no wrong.<br/><br/>The characters in the Justice League itself are quite interesting. There are outstanding ones, as there are ones that just fade into the background.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck's Batman just didn't do it for me. It's been a running gag that Batman's only got riches without any 'real' power or skillset that just keeps being emphasised in the film. Sure, that's comic relief, but at the expense of Batman being valued as an asset to the team. By the end of all the gags, you're just left thinking, ""So why is Batman even needed in the film?"" It would've been better to see Batman demonstrate his redeeming qualities, maybe as a leader or a tactician, but as far as I can tell, the film makes no such effort.<br/><br/>In contrast, Henry Cavill's Superman is just too powerful. As a character, Superman is done brilliantly, but his skillset is far too broad and far too great. He's basically overpowered, leaving me wondering why there was a need for Batman vs Superman at all. If he is all that powerful, and Batman is lacking, a conflict between the two seems like a ludicrous idea. (Again, coming from someone who hasn't watched Batman vs Superman) If he is all that powerful, why the need for the Justice League? Surely the Justice League allows heroes with a niche skill set to help each other out, but if DCEU's Superman exist, why bother at all? Justice League just seems like Superman and the Gang.<br/><br/>Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is just as charming as she was in the character's feature film. She has grown as a fighter and a person, but still has her own demons which she grapples with, making her that much more likable and charismatic.<br/><br/>Jason Momoa's Aquaman appears long enough in the film for audiences to have a good idea on what his character is like, but short enough that leaves them wanting for more in his own standalone film. Needless to say, his performance doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller's The Flash is brilliant. He provides the appropriately-timed comedic relief, all while showcasing what he can offer to the team. The shots of him in action are done perfectly, complementing his humorous character. I'll definitely be waiting on a solo film from The Flash.<br/><br/>Ray Fisher's Cyborg - not too sure what to feel about the character just yet. As the centerpiece of the team in this film, a lot is expected from his character. However, due to the compelling performance of his counterparts, Cyborg seems the least impressionable of the team. He doesn't really add anything new to the table, other than what is required to facilitate the plot. That doesn't make Cyborg bad, though - he is decent, but just not strong enough.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a 6/10. Just above average, as it is a cut above its predecessors, but even with its brilliant cast (albeit disappointment in the portrayal of some key team players), its pacing is haphazard and the plot is standard superhero-fare, with nothing fresh to offer."
"maaz2999","6","0","1","22 November 2017"," A disposable superhero ride
","I didn't hate justice league. But I surely did not love it either. The movie is passable. It has some major problems and some that can be ignored. First of all, the most common problem is the villain. Steppenwolf is given a backstory but it rather seems very forced and clichéd. The whole movie is a cliché. But the villain was just another CGI monster like ultron, doomsday or Aries. The second problem is not actually the fault of the director but that of wanner bros. as they passed the mandate for keeping the runtime of less than 2 hours. Due to this the movie was not always coherent and feels very rushed. Also sometimes the CGI seemed to be awful(Henry Cavil's moustache) Other problems were that the dialogue was sometimes weak and some of the humour fell flat. As for the positives, the movie is fun but disposable, all the performances were great specially Jason Mamoa. Ezra Miller is great as flash too. Ray Fisher us also good as Cyborg and Ben and Gal are top notch. The team has a good chemistry overall and Henry Cavil also steals the show. They really nailed Superman. But this is not a great or even a good movie, its okay and you'll really enjoy it if you're a DC fan."

"Screen_Blitz","7","0","3","21 November 2017"," Of course, Justice League is not the strongest entry in the DC Cinematic Universe, but for its grandeur sleek visual style and energy, it nonetheless hits the jackpot
","Assembling DC comics's most icon heroes into an alliance of Earth's mightiest defenders, Justice League sets stone to another attempt to pull the DC Cinematic Universe out of the ruts dug by two of their vastly disappointing entries 'Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice' and 'Suicide Squad'. Fortunately, last summer's 'Wonder Woman' was able to accomplish that. For the good news, this film succeeds on demonstrating that the cinematic universe is far from out of the game. On the other hand, it fails to reach the peak of 'Wonder Woman', which is almost predictable considering that film set a high bar for how superhero entries should operate. From visual and acting standpoint, the movie hits a home-run, which only renders it slightly disappointing that the narrative undergoes a blemished Returning as director is Zack Snyder who injected his project with his signature visual style before Joss Whedon, one of the writers, took over for some reshoots after Snyder was forced to step down following a family tragedy. And the evidence of the two directors colliding with their dissimilar approaches shines significantly obvious. This film follows Bruce Wayne (played by Ben Affleck) who pairs up the reluctant Diane Prince a.k.a. Wonderman (played by Gal Gadot) to rally up a team of meta-humans including Barry Allan/TheFlash (played by Ezra Miller), Arthur Curry/Aquaman (played by Jason Momoa), and Vincent Stone/Cyborg (played by Ray Fisher) to stand as the last line of defense against the evil monster Steppenwolff (voiced by Ciaran Hinds), an otherworldly emperor set to wipe out mankind. Meanwhile, the team along with Lois Lane (played by Amy Adams) and Martha Kent (played by Diane Lane) mourn the loss of Superman (played by Henry Cavill) who made an ultimate during the battle against Doomsday. <br/><br/>As exciting as it is, Justice League is perhaps not the saving hand for the DCEU in the fracture state it is following its previous entries, as 'Wonder Woman' already holds that title. Nonetheless, it feels quite refreshing to say that this rendition of the popular ensemble team of superheroes is not a hot mess. Director Zack Snyder breathes his trademark visual methodology in each frame while pumping excitement into the heart-racing action set pieces. And much like his previous project, CGI makes a dominating appearance, for both better and worse, and plays a major role in feasting the eyes with a sleek visual scope. Perhaps I should not forget the heavy use slow-mo sequences. But the flaws lying within recent entries in the cinematic universe lead audiences, especially fans to the impressing question how soundness of the plot. To say the least, there are some noteworthy flaws, but it is most certainly not messy. Occuping the first half-hour is the introduction of each character and establishing their arcs. Some are more stronger than others. While Wonder Woman is introduced an exhilarating sequence involving her thwarting a bank robbery, the rest of characters are restrained to expository scenes establishing their backstories without getting their time to shine long until the climatic sequence, which the film rushes into rather sloppily, when are they forced to band together against Steppenwolf who sits as arguably the weakest aspect of the narrative. As a villain, this CGI-constructed monster is rather generic and lacks a concrete background beyond desiring to wipe out the universe. What is his motivation? The answer is left out of our reach, and seemingly the heroes as well. Ciaran Hinds' voice performance is the best thing we get out of his baddie. <br/><br/>Building a solid team of heroes requires not only solid character arcs, which are sadly lacking in some, but the charisma of the cast members. Fortunately, Ben Affleck who introduced himself as Batman in the disappointing foray that was 'Batman V. Superman' remains appealing as ever as the dark cape crusador. Of course, he never quite holds the title of the show stealer as that is given to Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman who has already established herself as a warmly charismatic female hero in her stand-alone entry from last summer. She is gifted with the most memorable moments among the rest of the cast. Jason Momoa, playing the aquatic-type hero Aquaman, stands likable and holds a fair spirit in the role. His most memorable lies not within the actions sequences, but in a laugh- worthy expository sequence where he comes in contact with Wonder Woman's lasso of truth. Ray Fisher is fine as Cyborg who unfortunately falls victim to a weak backstory that places his appeal in severe constraints. Playing the speedy hero in a red lightning suit is Ezra Miller as the Flash, who tries to capture the comedic spirit of Tom Holland in 'Spiderman: Homecoming' by going gonzo with goofy one-liners that unfortunately wear out their welcome long before the film reaches it climax, not to mention his clammy dialogue. Finally, it is no spoiler that Superman make his return after the character was butchered with an unforeseen death in 'Batman V. Superman'. That is when Henry Cavill comes to the picture, and he is fine as ever. But don't expect too much screen time from him. The heroes make a fair chemistry, but their comedic muscles are rather dull as they try to sustain Joss Whedon's light- hearted approach while flowing through the slightly darker tone of Zack Snyder's direction that was remains in scenes outside of Whedon's reshot sequences. That is not to say that we do not get a few great Whedon-esque laughs.<br/><br/>Justice League most certainly does to reach the high bar established by 'Wonder Woman' nor does it mark a single turning point for the DC Cinematic Universe. But what is accomplishes, it offers a fun thrill ride to feast the hearts of comic book fans as well as everyone else craving for a sweet exercise in the superhero realm. As for the DCEU, the franchise is miles away from reaching the height of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that is if it has a chance."

"politicidal","7","0","3","21 November 2017"," You Can't Save the World Alone - Justice League is flawed but fun entertainment
","The Justice League is finally here after a notoriously troubled production and the exit of its original director Zack Snyder under tragic circumstances. Avengers maestro Joss Whedon assumed the role at WB's behest and while his directorial experience doesn't tie all the loose ends together, Justice League remains an entertaining if unevenly assembled superhero movie.<br/><br/>The plot picks up after Superman's death and the world is now at risk of another alien invasion. This time by the bloodthirsty tyrant Steppenwolf (a CGI Ciaran Hinds). Batman and Wonder Woman race to assemble a new team of superpowered humans (Flash, Cyborg, and Aquaman) to confront this otherworldly threat.<br/><br/>If anything is to be commended about Justice League, it's the cast. They're solid as action heroes and rock solid working together. The action scenes emphasize the importance of teamwork. Interestingly though, some of its best moments are just with the JL members talking to each other.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck remains a worthy successor to Christian Bale as Batman, far more likable than in BVS. Gal Gadot is the standout as Wonder Woman. Jason Momoa is having a blast as Aquaman. Ray Fisher and Ezra Miller play the youngest members, Cyborg and Flash. Both do fine when they're enjoying themselves. However, sometimes, Fisher plays his alter-ego Victor Stone a tad wooden. Ezra Miller plays the role of Barry Allen/Flash with glee but his hyperactive manic performance offsets the dramatic moments he does have in some parts of the movie.<br/><br/>While most of what works in the movie makes it fun, what doesn't work remains glaringly noticeable. Unfortunately, the choice of antagonist Steppenwolf is utterly uninteresting despite his imposing design. This is due to the CGI for his character being standard at best and Steppenwolf's motivations being murky. His demonic minions look better and are more menacing. A second issue is the pacing. It's become knowledgeable now that WB cut the film down from a longer running time of perhaps 2.5 hours to roughly two hours at best. While this does make it a quick sit, the movie's first half takes too much time and then it's a mad rush to the third act and its obvious reveal.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, I'll REVEAL THE THIRD ACT TWIST. PLEASE STOP READING IF YOU MANAGED TO AVOID SPOILERS THIS LONG. Superman does come back to life and for purists, this is the closest Henry Cavill has been to the classic image that Christopher Reeve trail-blazed. It's great to watch. One is left hoping that Cavill is given another chance in the future.<br/><br/>It's true that JUSTICE LEAGUE is not the next AVENGERS. That may disappoint some people and leave them underwhelmed. If it had a better villain and a better sense of pacing, it'd be a strong contender for that title. But as it is, it is a step in the right direction as set by the superior DCEU film Wonder Woman."
"davidcshannon","8","0","3","21 November 2017"," Less Epic, Easier to Follow
","Man of Steel is one of the most epic movies ever. Dawn of Justice was entertaining but convoluted and confusing. Wonder Woman had an amazing setup undercut by an underwhelming villain. Let's ignore Suicide Squad.<br/><br/>Justice League doesn't have the same epic feel as MoS, and doesn't have quite the intensity of DoJ. But, the dialog and characters are as good as in WW, and it's a heck of a lot easier to understand than DoJ was, even after DoJ's extended cut. To be clear, my seventy-year-old parents were able to follow the plot, and enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The villain is not the scariest in history, but he's a lot more intimidating than Ares. Certainly beats the pants off the MCU Ultron.<br/><br/>There's a scene with the five revealed League members attempting to recruit a sixth, which may have been my favorite scene in any of the DCEU movies. If nothing else, it's worth watching the movie just to see that.<br/><br/>The pacing did seem a little uneven. I hear that the studio insisted on a certain runtime, which couldn't have affected anything positively. I'm looking forward to seeing an extended version, which I expect to be smoother.<br/><br/>A few people have complained about the special effects. I don't know what they're talking about.

"tsears-423-200715","7","0","3","21 November 2017"," Not nearly as bad as haters say, but WB needs to stop cramming 3-hr movies into 2-hr bags
","As with BvS, the major issue with this movie is the pacing and disjointedness. I can't for the life of me understand why Warner Brothers insists on bringing these movies in short (2 hrs for JL, 2-1/2 for BvS), when ITS THE FAN-BOY WORD-OF-MOUTH THAT WILL GREATLY DETERMINE THEIR SUCCESS. As has been widely acknowledged, the extended cut of BvS reveals a MUCH BETTER movie than the theatrical release. I have no doubt the same will prove true of JL. If it's good, people will pay and watch despite 2.5/3-hr run times - ever heard of Lord of the Rings, Avengers, the Dark Knight Trilogy? SMH.<br/><br/>I'll say ""spoiler ahead"" here out of abundance of caution, but for anyone paying attention/that has seen Man of Steel/BvS it's obviously not: Superman's return is the big problem with this movie. It's awfully rushed, as is his addition to the team and his reacquaintance with Lois Lane, Martha Kent, Batman and Wonder Woman. I'm sure the WB-mandated 2- hour running time accounted for a lot of the short-shrift given to this element of the story. Cyborg's crucial origin (given the movie's overall plot) is administered to us fire-hose fashion as well.<br/><br/>As for the villain Steppenwolf, he's a pretty standard, (literally from his own mouth) destroyer-of-worlds bad guy. Some reviews have complained about the bad CGI: I didn't think it was bad, just a lot of it, including the obvious un-mustaching of Henry Cavill in unfortunately too many full-screen head shots (making it nigh un- missable). I actually thought the action sequences were far and away the strong point of the movie.<br/><br/>It's too bad Snyder couldn't finish this. Whedon's lighter touch is clear in numerous moments throughout (some work, some don't). Still, this was a better movie than the BvS theatrical release (but not the BvS extended edition). Makes me all the more anxious now to see the more Snyder-esque cut once this hits Blu-Ray! As it stands, this movie is a solid super-hero romp, but not a lot more. But it does not approach the disaster some have tried to make it out to be (as was similarly done with BvS and Man of Steel)."

Although the world still mourns over Superman, single-minded Bruce Wayne senses danger on the horizon and aligns himself with Diana Prince to recruit other gifted individuals who can combat the latest threat, but whether or not they actually know what it is they're up against, or whether they can put their egos aside for the greater good remains a mystery. More setup than actual execution, with a fairly weak story and a central villain that's easily forgettable, but likely to coast by on the appeal of its characters and numerous action scenes. Results are so-so, but both Gadot and Miller add life to the proceedings. **½"
"PetarNeo","6","0","1","21 November 2017"," It will amaze you and disappoint you
","Looking back two years and now seeing this will make you wonder is there hope for DC because they decide not to change anything and constantly get the same result in movie. Is it because of Snyder (Man of Steel, Batman v Superman, Watchmen) who maybe isn't good enough option for directing the movie or is it maybe because of hype that never gets to reach it's true potential we will maybe find out when Matt Reeves gets us a new Batman movie. As it goes with Justice League there were some pretty good things and some that maybe should have been taken more devotion to magnify them. From the start plot seemed like it had some potential with us seeing Batman gathering team to save the world from upcoming threats and then at some point it just took the wrong turn and kept feeding us with boring plot. Then it was cut to action scenes which made us forget about plot and put us to edge how good they actually looked but moment they were gone comes realization that it didn't fix anything and again put us into horrible decision or sub-plots. Then action comes back and it's 'great' villain which seemed less scarier than Batman if you take him to perspective because of miserable power that it showed us. Steppenwolf just seemed like he is good at kicking things around and provide no real satisfaction from villain that it's supposed to be. In the end it seemed like it was no trouble to defeat him but company fighting him just made themselves more problems with their decisions. Directing as always from Zack Snyder is like 'seen that', 'been there' and 'done that', nothing new and interesting that will keep you amazed and even sometimes bad as you look into movie and see scene jumps from the start to the immediate end and you're like 'okay they just cut the whole middle of scene'. Stars in movie are pretty much all the same and gave performance as expected, except Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Flash (Ezra Miller) which both had their good and funny scenes and absolutely stole moments of their screening time. It wouldn't hurt to make movie more violent and with far more story telling but not much longer in time which doesn't seem like tough thing to do but we are only here to watch the movie and not make it. 2.5/4"
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","6","0","4","21 November 2017"," Better than the last few films involving all these characters
","With Marvel Studios now seemingly perfected the concept of making every superhero film fresh and new, several critics continue to bash Warner Brothers for continuously failing to replicate any of those elements into their comic book movie adaptations. That's actually hard to fully get on board with. As much as Warner Brother Studios continues to play catch up with their rival film studio, they have managed to pull through in certain areas. As divisive as Man of Steel (2013) and Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) were to many viewers, Warner Brothers has managed to finally establish their set of shared movie universes. And as much flack as they get for stumbling along the way, they are persistent, you have to give them that. Now with their magnum opus here, finally bringing to life famous characters and successfully uniting them altogether, their end result is just okay. They got Wonder Woman (2017) right, so how did this turn out to be just okay? It's just a lot when it's all said and done.<br/><br/>Directed again by Zack Snyder, the plot follows the events of Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) with the death of Superman (Henry Cavill). Fearing that with Superman gone, earth won't be able to defend itself from a new evil named Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciarán Hinds), Batman (Ben Affleck) gathers Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher) as backup. There's also a subplot about the possibility of resurrecting Superman using what is called a ""mother box"". According to Wonder Woman, there were three and if all were combined it would be the beginning of the end. The script was written by Chris Terrio and Joss Whedon of which both have had their share of successful films. Whedon is obviously known for leading Marvel's The Avengers (2012) and Serenity (2005). Chris Terrio was the writer to Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and Argo (2012). But even with this premise and setup, there are still problems to be had with the script.<br/><br/>Recurring supporting characters are almost pointless in this entry, except for a few. Actors like Jeremy Irons as Alfred and Joe Morton as Silas Stone are used because they are necessary for certain characters. However, other characters like Commissioner Gordon (J.K. Simmons), Lois Lane (Amy Adams), Martha Kent (Diane Lane), Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and even Mera (Amber Heard) are all characters that either can be reintroduced or debut for their first time in a another film. Jamming in all these other individuals throughout the movie just feel like the producers want everyone to remember these people exist. Another blunder is the whole cataclysmic plot device that somehow makes its way into every superhero film. Can there ever be a time where these kinds of things aren't used in ensemble movies? It's just a really tiresome setup. Lastly there's the concept of Superman's memory if he were to be brought back to life. If his memory does remain, how is it that he seems to remember only certain things?<br/><br/>However even with that said, there are components that do work in this film's favor. Gone is the dark and and ho-hum atmosphere of Man of Steel (2013) and Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Now the tone has shifted to where things are more as one would say, normal. On top of that, the actors who share the lens together share great on screen chemistry. Momoa, Gadot, Affleck, Miller and Fisher all have their moments to shine. Momoa and Miller are really the ones who steal the show; which is impressive. Especially for Momoa, since Aquaman has always been thought of being the harder superhero to adapt correctly. Some of their interactions together are based on prior decisions, while others are analyzed through the time a choice is made at that very moment. Either way, the dialog held between these individuals are done so in a way that is enjoyable and lets the audience know that these protagonists are not serious all the time. Yet when a call to arms is made, this is another area where this movie shines.<br/><br/>One thing's for sure, Zack Snyder knows how to create action spectacles and that's no different here. The action is better than his other efforts because the live-action doesn't look so much like a video game cut scene. This also in due part to Fabian Wagner's cinematography. Wagner, who has mostly used his skills on the small screen did an adequate job for this blockbuster. Many of the shots capture a lot of geography and hardly any of it is too close to make out. Wagner has filmed for the Game of Thrones and Sherlock series, and for Victor Frankenstein (2015). For music, the film score was composed this time by Danny Elfman. Thankfully Elfman really knows how to make a score work correctly. The drowning soundscapes of Hans Zimmer and Tom Holkenborg are hardly ever heard here and that's great. The Man of Steel (2013) theme is heard once but Elfman rightfully reuses John Williams' Superman (1978) theme and his own Batman (1989) theme during the film. That's classic music and it works better than anything else.<br/><br/>While it may still have its problems of over bloated character appearances and overused plot devices, this entry has slightly improved over passed blunders. The action still entertains, the on screen chemistry between actors is great, and the film score is more organic in sound."

","Justice League <br/><br/>On the theatrical release of Batman Vs Superman, that particular movie was met with a lot of negative criticism. I think mainly due to the incoherent storyline. Yes the movie was a dark brooding affair but this wasn't the real problem. Batman is supposed to be dark. No, the real problem was that the film had been meddled with by studio executives. They cut up the film to give it a leaner runtime. A shorter film allows more screenings, more screenings results in more money. On the release of the directors cut or Ultimate edition as it is known, I believe we got a much better movie.<br/><br/>Fast forward on to the Justice League and those studio execs have been meddling once more. However this time around we do get a much more enjoyable movie right off the bat! (Pardon the pun). At 2hrs and 1 min this movie does have its work cut out. Obviously we are up to speed with Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman but the film needs to establish three unexplored Superheroes and the actual storyline.<br/><br/>The actual story is generic superhero movie fodder. Nothing original here. Big evil nasty dude needs to gather together three ridiculously named objects (Mother boxes! Really?) that will bring about worldwide destruction and only our newly assembled heroes can stop him. The villain in question is Steppenwolf a bland CGI creation who evokes no feeling of danger or peril in the audience and is only really there for our heroes to kick the crap out of. This is where the movie feels under developed and rushed.<br/><br/>Justice Leagues strongest point is the Superhero characters themselves. Just enough time is given to develop the newcomers and their camaraderie is what makes the film shine. A good dose of humour has been injected into the script and this allows the paying audience to have a good time.<br/><br/>Ben Affleck is superb as Batman even if I personally still prefer Christian Bales take on the character. Gal Gadot proves she was the absolute right choice to play Wonder Woman. Bringing me on to the newbies. Jason Momoa as Aquaman and Ezra Miller as the Flash bring the humour and Ray Fisher as Cyborg is the coolest robotic creation since the Terminator. OK maybe after the original Robocop. Last but certainly not least (spoiler ahead) is the return of Henry Cavill as Superman. Another part of the movie that seems rushed is the Man of Steels resurrection. We all knew it was coming but it feels that a large chunk of his return was left on the cutting room floor. This is a shame as Cavill's reappearance as the man from Krypton is the highlight of the movie. He has certainly eased into the role and this is the Superman we've all been waiting to see.<br/><br/>Justice League is a much more colourful movie , more in tone with Wonder Woman's debut than Batman Vs Superman and it has rays of humour that light up the screen. There are problems with the movie though, but I think they're problems that can be mostly ironed out when the directors cut inevitably arrives.<br/><br/>Those studio execs sure do know how to extract our money from us"

","Batman needs a shave.<br/><br/>He can also use a shower, by the look of things—the brooding countenance he's displayed in more recent motion picture adventures seems to have developed into a full-scale funk in ""Justice League,"" or at least a particularly sullen attitude which eventually results in a couple of beatings at the hands of his superhero friends. <br/><br/>In ""Justice League,"" when an alien despot named Steppenwolf arrives on Earth with his army of deadly cicada-like minions, Batman must recruit a league of superheroes, including Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash, to work in tandem with himself and Wonder Woman to defeat the alien threat and save the world.<br/><br/>The alien invaders are the least of the superheroes' worries in this picture, compared with the obstacles of clunky dialogue, one tired characterization, and a few plot details which just don't make any sense. <br/><br/>From that perspective, Batman's attitude and unkempt appearance are probably understandable, and even more so considering the troubled history of this latest picture from the DC Comics universe. In fact, Steppenwolf and his alien friends might be partly responsible for saving ""Justice League"" from complete failure. <br/><br/>In development since 2007, ""Justice League"" was as of 2014 meant to be the first installment of a two-part series, Zack Snyder's next project after 2013's ""Man of Steel"" and 2016's ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."" <br/><br/>Once begun, the picture's principal photography lasted from April until October of 2016, after which Snyder brought aboard writer/director Joss Whedon to write a few extra scenes to be shot later, during May of 2017. But the expanded production schedule of the picture was interrupted in March by the tragic death of Zack Snyder's adult daughter (wife Deborah is also one of the producers of ""Justice League""). <br/><br/>After the funeral of their daughter, both Snyders returned briefly to the production, but soon abandoned the project to grieve their loss. <br/><br/>Whedon's duties were expanded by Warner Bros to include directing the additional scenes he'd written for the picture. Whedon had previously guided 2012's ""The Avengers"" and 2015's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" for DC's comic book rival, Marvel Entertainment. <br/><br/>Following the surprise worldwide success of ""Wonder Woman"" in June, two more months of additional reshoots were added to the production schedule. And along the way, the picture's budget kept growing until the final cost reached a mammoth $300 million, making ""Justice League"" the third most expensive movie in motion picture history, behind the two latest installments in Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise.<br/><br/>Whedon was given three objectives by Warner Bros.—lighten the picture's tone, expand Wonder Woman's presence, and deliver a picture with a running time of two hours or less Both ""Man of Steel"" and ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" had drawn severe criticism for their overlength.<br/><br/>The good news is that Joss Whedon has accomplished all three of the Warner objectives. Despite its failings, ""Justice League"" moves like lightening at 119 minutes, and contains a plot which is both compelling and relatively easy to comprehend—no small accomplishment in these days of absurdly complicated science fiction. <br/><br/>In addition, during the action sequences which occupy much of the film, the screen is filled with images which are eye-filling, and colorful in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>The single worst-kept secret in the DC universe is the identity of the iconic superhero who's resurrected from the dead in ""Justice League."" And of the dozens of ways available to regenerate a departed character in comic book-driven science fiction, the filmmakers in this picture have chosen the solitary option which involves grave-robbery, resulting in the film's gamier moments. <br/><br/>As an example of the film's clunky dialogue, after the character is revived, his description of the experience is the single word, ""Weird."" When pressed on the point, he elaborates, ""Really weird.""<br/><br/>The rookie members of the Justice League fare quite well in the picture— Jason Momoa as Aquaman is earthy, plain-spoken, and raucous, Ray Fisher as Cyborg gives Batman competition for sullen attitude and self-pity, and young Ezra Miller as The Flash displays a hyperactive Howie Mandel- like persona—endearing or grating, depending on your taste. In a world of demigods, Miller's Flash is the audience's surrogate, delivering observations and asking questions the viewer might, if given the chance.<br/><br/>But the lion's share of ""Justice League"" belongs to Ben Affleck as Batman and especially the delightful Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Despite Affleck's lazy and repressed performance, his character moves the plot alongeffectively allowing an opportunity for Gadot's star to shine even brighter. If Affleck's performance seems tired and stale, Gadot's is a breath of pure oxygen. <br/><br/>""Justice League"" moves the DC superheroes closer to the rarefied air of their rivals at Marvel. And while DC has a way to go before becoming a real threat to the Marvel entertainment colossus, ""Justice League"" is a big, and very entertaining, step in the right direction."

"aayushkharby","5","0","4","20 November 2017"," Justice League was better than the last DC movie, but it did not fulfill our expectations.
","So DC fans were kept waiting for over a year and a half after Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice for the newest addition to the DC Extended Universe. Director Zack Snyder was being counted on by many to light up the DCEU with Justice League after a showy yet hollow prequel in the form of Dawn of Justice.<br/><br/>The movie picks up from where its predecessor ended; the world in shambles after the tragic end of Superman (Henry Cavill). The human race still isn't over that yet though, and Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) and Lois Lane (Amy Adams) still seem to overly brood over Clark Kent. Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) is her charismatic yet mortiferous best, dealing out justice with her sword and lasso of truth.<br/><br/>Enter Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds), the big bad guy with the alien army, who aims to milk the opportunity presented to him in the form of Earth after the demise of its Kryptonian protector. Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince immediately set out to recruit their very own fantasy dream team.<br/><br/>The plot progresses with the expected bumps and falls associated with the formation of any team (no matter how super it is). Speaking of super things, DC played their hidden card well and kept a heavy cloak of suspense over Kal-El's return.<br/><br/>As far as the characters are concerned, the introduction of the new age meta-humans saves the blushes of the DCEU. Barry Allen (Ezra Miller) lightens the mood with his wide-eyed innocence and waggish one-liners, but his character, on the whole, gives out a sense of over-the-top irritation. Aquaman (Jason Momoa) is shown as a stand- alone badass in a perpetual bad mood (it's not as bad as the Hulk's), which fits his character.<br/><br/>The real horror, in my opinion, was the ineffective and lackluster performance put up by Batman. A drastic drop in the bat vigilante's character coupled with his struggle to lead this newly formed team points fingers at the actual importance of his role in the DC Universe. Put bluntly, his superhero résumé would only read the word ""billionaire"".<br/><br/>The characters of Jim Gordon (J.K. Simmons), the Police Commissioner of Gotham, and Alfred J. Pennyworth (Jeremy Irons), Bruce Wayne's glorified butler, satisfy, but find only a minimal role in the midst of this inter-galactic battle.<br/><br/>However, despite Snyder's best efforts, the morbid and droopy undertone that dominated Dawn of Justice infects the core of Justice League as well. A generic plot coupled with a predictable storyline take away the X-factor we all hoped the movie would possess. In most scenes, the doomy look bears a resemblance to the Upside Down from Stranger Things, and no, that's not a compliment.<br/><br/>The monotonous punch fest DC glamorously promotes as the center stage is a melee of overworked CGI and an almost saddening visual wreck. Music director Danny Elfman was able to engage the audience with his enthralling soundtrack, but the ghost of Hans Zimmer looms over the DCEU and his absence was notably missed.<br/><br/>Another set of complaints any superhero fan may have with Justice League are the blatant similarities that can be drawn to the MCU. The relationship Bruce Wayne shares with Barry Allen eerily resembles the one between Peter Parker and Tony Stark. Moreover, the concept of the Mother Boxes is quite like the fabled Infinity Stones of the MCU.<br/><br/>Although Justice League was an assortment of disappointments, the silver lining was the widening of the plot for the forthcoming sequels. The DCEU is being shadowed by the vibrant and diversified MCU, and they need to seriously up their game if they wish to move out of the second place spot. The DCEU is a far cry from Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy, and the class of Nolan's Batman seems like a distant fairy tale.<br/><br/>I give Justice League 3 stars out of 5. I'm unimpressed, but most certainly hungry for more."

","Well one of the most hyped up movies of 2017 The Justice League is finally here. And as a Justice League fan I was also thrilled and excited to see this movie, being a fan of the Justice League animated series and Justice League comics I wanted to see the first live on screen appearance of my favourite childhood heroes. But I have to say I was little bit disappointed with the outcome. True enjoyed the movie but the final product, I was disappointed with. Once you see the movie it is clear that this is not the original version of the movie that was intended to hit the theatres or at least this was not the full version. The portrayal of the six characters that is mainly Superman, Aquaman, Wonder woman, Batman, Cyborg and Flash were good. Some may suggest that the characters of Cyborg could have been improved but still good job nonetheless. The movie was a lot of fun compared to the previous installments of the DCEU. It had a lot of humour in it compared to the dark, gritty and serious Batman v Superman movie. For any DC fans this movie definitely has some comic references here and there in some scenes which will excite them but to the general audience who are most probably not familiar with Aquaman and Cyborg this movie may not have the intended effect it should have had for them, especially with no solo origin movies. Zack Snyder tried his level best to explain the story of the new characters to his best but unfortunately because of the WB mandate of making the movie only 2 hour long significant portion of the movie was edited out, and the resultant problem is evident. This has caused a lot of pacing issues with the movie. Most of the scenes don't have a completion to them.The transition between different scenes is also not smooth. There is also use of extensive CGI, but still there are some scenes that falls apart such as the infamous moustache replacement which is visible in a few selected scenes. Plot was also week most probably due to the extensive editing done to the movie which also results in a weak villain who is one dimensional with no motive apart from conquering the world. Justice League is the result of what could have been the greatest movies of all time but failed because Warner brothers wanted a short film that would excite the general audience for the future DCEU movies, sacrificing plot, villain and importantly the loyal fans of DC. But Warner brothers did succeed in their motive of exciting the audience for the future of DCEU."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","5","0","6","20 November 2017"," This may just be the second best of the DCEU titles, but being bored into submission shouldn't be the standard for superhero entertainment of the non-Marvel variety.
","'Justice League' is not quite as boring as 'Man Of Steel' or 'Batman V Superman' mainly because it's far shorter and far simpler, to the point that the story itself can be boiled down to one surprise-less compound sentence devoid of development or detail even at the most basic of sub-surface levels, and it isn't as much of an abysmal assault on the senses as 'Suicide Squad' mainly because it is, for the most part, legible and competently constructed on a technical scale, but this latest entry into the DCEU is still a dull and joyless experience that somehow still all seems like set-up when it should feel like some form of pay-off, a culmination of what's come before in a similar way to 'Avengers Assemble' (a flick which this has no issue in taking elements from, just not the right ones); there's still the undeniable fact that almost nothing ever feels tangible and the action sequences are so obviously digital that you'll be wearing a squint for most of the piece just to see what's going on, a fact not helped by the fact that most of them are infused with Zack Snyder's signature speed-ramping style and it's made even more visually confusing because a few core characters can move incredibly fast (while leads to some wildly speed-ramped slow-motion segments, 'slow-mo-ception' if you will, just to make things absolutely crazy), while the characters are all practically invincible so you're never inherently invested in their survival either and the feature never does anything to make you care about neither the key players (whom almost all seem as though they are desperate not to be there) nor the world at large which is oddly sidelined save a couple 'save the world' lines, so in the end the movie just comes across as incredibly lifeless, relatively unentertaining and just about as false as a certain special someone's CGI-enhanced upper-lip. 5/10"
"mariotasic1994","7","0","3","20 November 2017"," It could have been and should have been better - but I can't help but love it.
","So I decided to review this movie. It's hard for me to do this, but I just want to and quite frankly need to. <br/><br/>I went to the movie theater twice to see this movie. Twice in four days. Did I have fun? Hell yeah. Did I laugh? Absolutely. It was a good time, both times. But, is it a good movie? I'm not sure. I'm gonna list the good and the bad and let you decide. <br/><br/>PROS: - The characters are great - it's funny - it's the GODDAMN Justice League! - and i mean every character (from the League) works great for me. EVERY SINGLE ONE. They had great chemistry.<br/><br/>CONS: - the plot is just bland, empty - villain is weak - sure he's huge and all but there was just one scene where I thought he was a threat and terrifying - the soundtrack is non-inspiring - Danny elfman was a mistake. I love the old batman and all but this is the new one. It was not an epic soundtrack. It was generic and boring. - I did not feel inspired after walking out of the movie. I should have been inspired like hell. I was not. - Cavills CGI mustache were bloody terrible<br/><br/>Now, i think that the version we saw is not a complete version. I enjoyed the opening and closing scene the most. It was emotional, real and interesting. I know that was Snyder. And I love it. Whedon did great but some of the jokes were misplaced. I want my DC movies a little darker, more serious. It adds depth, emotions. I want real stakes. No matter what you think of BvS - it had that. It inspired me. It was fun, emotional. With all it's flaws. <br/><br/>Marvel is fun as hell, great movies. BUT they have no shock value. They are predictable. I don't always want that. I love Snyders vision and I think WB need to chill out and not set all those boundaries. I want that complete version of Justice League. The world deserves it. <br/><br/>To end this - JL is a step in the right direction, but they need more creative freedom (the directors). It could have been and should have been better.<br/><br/>My vote - 7/10. I know i said a lot of bad things and it sounds like a 4 or a 5, but i enjoyed it and i don't blame neither Snyder nor Whedon - I blame WB. <br/><br/>Go see it, decide for yourselves."
"Giftedallen","5","0","3","20 November 2017"," Great movie, loved it from beginning to end!
","Honestly loved this movie. I find that the critics are very hard on DC Extended Universe films. Whereas Suicide Squad is not very good, I find that Man of Steel, Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice (specifically the Ultimate Edition) and Wonder Woman are all wonderful, solid movies.<br/><br/>Justice League is no exception. This movie is fairly solid, I just wish Warner Brothers didn't get so specific on their run-time because this film could have been much better without Brother Eye watching over the length. The action scenes were amazing and jaw- dropping (for both comic and non-comic book fans alike). The Justice League has a comedic factor to it but not to the extent of (dare I say) Thor: Ragnorok or Doctor Strange where the comedy often feels forced upon you. I disagree with the critic score and favour the audience score a lot more. The plot of the film made sense and served as a cohesive story through and through. <br/><br/>I am happy and proud to say that I love this movie and plan on watching it again in theaters and buying it on Blu-Ray as well. Spend the extra dollars for IMAX as well if you can, it's definitely worth it. The characters will grab you, the visuals will keep you and you will surely leave the theater with a smile on your face (just make sure to stay until the very end of the film)."
"targe1314","8","0","4","20 November 2017"," DC finally moving in the right direction
","I was cautiously happy with the latest DC movie Justice League. They are still filming in grey monochrome (other than Superman's farm) but at least now the tone is lighter and the action sequences are better, the jokes are better too.<br/><br/>By far the best job is done by the Flash, as Ezra Miller turns in a fantastic effort on his role, which he is clearly stoked on.<br/><br/>Less stellar is Ben Affleck's second time out in the batcape. I've heard he wants out, and it showed in this movie. He plays Batman as a brooding, guilt-ridden shadow, not up to leading the team, hoping WW takes it over, almost as if he was playing himself.<br/><br/>Aquaman as a dark haired Conan the Barbarian is a jarring sell, but it was okkkaaaaayyyy....... nothing to stop the presses about.<br/><br/>Perhaps the breakout unexpected performance was from Ray Fisher, playing the tortured man-robot Cyborg, full of self-loathing but wanting ultimately to help.<br/><br/>Special nod to the Batmobile, surely the greatest batmobile ever since the original, covered in guns it is a terror on 4 wheels. Batman's crawling spider-thing (name is forgettable) was less so, very silly in fact and one wondered what sort of cocaine trip Bruce Wayne was on to craft such an impractable piece of oversized junk.<br/><br/>Overall though this is a good start for a 'DC Rennaissance' and I hav e high hopes for the future, and would not be unhappy at all if they brought in a new Batman. Christian Bale, you are SORELY MISSED....."
"mikelynskey-10942","7","0","3","20 November 2017"," Enjoyable and funny, but very flawed.
","Firstly, Justice League is a dream come true to watch on the big screen. I've been a massive fan of everything DC since i can remember. But, this film is just basic, enjoyable film with a lot of very funny jokes and great easter eggs and cameos. But, it is very flawed, all the characters chemistry was great but i think they went a bit too far with it, there were far too many jokes, even in the serious scenes. The only person i was expecting too make jokes were the flash and i think his were some of the worst. You can 100% tell where the joss whedon jokes came into force and they didn't work one bit. The action from start to finish was good enough but a bit jumpy and just kept cutting to different scenes which didn't make sense to the story to either introduce a character or just get on with the story. My main problem with this film was the villain, i didn't get what his overall plan was most of the time and i don't think the story did either, his small cameos from time to time were just messy and pushed. I feel like this film could of been a lot better if he was not in his film at all and there was something else, i don't know who but i have a little idea. The cameo at the end with Lex Luthor was great and with deathstroke was simply great but i think they could of made a lot better villains it just would of made sense having the legion of doom, with lex being in the last film it would of made sense with his revenge and maybe a cameo of him finding mother boxes at the end and finding a way to get in touch with Steppenwolf or Darkseid and that could of been the second justice league film, i don't know i thought that straight away when i walked out. Enjoyed it but thought MOS and BVS were a lot better."
"paulabiline","7","0","3","20 November 2017"," Not bad, but...
","Justice League was a pretty good movie and there were some things that I liked and some things I didn't.<br/><br/>Things I liked: Justice League was better than I expected and I liked that the movie was simple and understandable, not like The Avengers (too many superheros in one film together). I liked the new cool characters for an example Aquaman, Flash, Cyborg and the funny moments with them.<br/><br/>But things that i didn't like were: that the end of the film was so predictable and it was like every other superhero movie. In fight scenes we didn't see Batman very often, the movie showed that Batman was very weak and easy to beat. The villain named Steppenwolf was not scary at all and he was a boring character because he was exactly like some other supervillain who wants to destroy the world. In conclusion: the movie was not bad, but we now know that DC is capable of doing better movies."
"fuzzymax-76787","6","0","4","20 November 2017"," Justice League aims for a brighter tone, but ultimately falls flat on its face. Watchable it may be, but also disappointing.
","Expectations were high ahead of Justice League. It had to kick start a cinematic, justify its colossal hype and set up solo films for a couple of new heroes. That and make bucket loads of money. Walking out of the cinema following this film, I knew that it would not accomplish all of those objectives. First, the positives; there are some excellent action set pieces in this film, accompanied by solid (for the most part) special effects. There it's also some amusing humour threaded in throughout, and in terms of acting, Gal Gadot gives another reliable turn as Wonder Woman, with Ezra Miller stealing scenes as the Flash, even if his irreverent quipping becomes irritatingly tiresome after a while. The set piece in the middle of the film is also spectacular, if overshadowed by the dismal second half of this film, and it was dismal. The flaws are about to come pouring out now, so hold on tight. First and foremost, the plot of Justice League is diabolical, at times even ridiculous. The editing in this film is very messy as well; you can really notice that a lot of the film was cut in post production. I do appreciate the tragedy surrounding Zack Snyder however, so I can forgive this. The characters I cannot forgive. The way they are scripted is horrible especially for characters like Aquaman and Cyborg, as portrayed by Jason Momoa and Ray Fisher respectively. Cyborg is really underdeveloped (although that isn't helped by Fisher's lifeless performance), and Aquaman underused and forgettable. Ben Affleck also seems to have lost that special something that made him so watchable as Batman in BvS; perhaps his charisma. And finally Ciaran Hinds, who portrays Steppenwolf, makes the most strained, generic and by the numbers villain I think I've ever seen in a Superhero Film.To say the cast isn't helped by the troubled production and awful script and plot is an understatement, but I expected so much more. In conclusion, a sloppy, disappointing mess, which is actually still quite enjoyable if you take away the negativity weighing it down and crippling the film's positives. One last thing; there is a scene with a *Cough* *Cough* character and their somewhat controversial bottom lip which I thought was very poorly thought out, bar one brilliant element."
"alindsay-al","8","0","1","17 November 2017"," A good film that brings dc's best heroes together
","So after man of steel everyone was ready for the eventuality that a justice league movie would happen and now it has, and it was fun if not flawed in its execution. The premise of the film sees Batman and wonder woman assembling a team to take on a threat stronger then any of them on there own. Ben affleck reprises his role as Bruce wayne/batman in this film and he was good. He didn't stand out as much as he did in batman vs superman but his character has developed since then and it is interesting seeing him trying to develop into this better person and it works well. Gal gadot is back as wonder woman and she is great in this role, she owns all the action scenes and she has a real presence about her on screen that helps her stand out. To the newcomers I am a big fan of the flash TV series so I was sceptical about having a new flash but I really liked ezra Miller as Barry Allen in this film. He might be too over the top in this film for some people but for me he really was the energy and fast paced character that the flash would be and I liked his fun performance. Ray Fisher plays cyborg and he was probably the most interesting character in the film as you see him attempt to get to grips with his pretty new situation and it was great to watch him try and adapt with everybody in the film. Jason mamoa is aquaman and I enjoyed his lovable rogue quality to the character, but I feel he is the most underused of the members of the league. The villain steppenwolf is functional but doesn't stand out as being a memorable villain at all. There are a few smaller roles that were well done too that I won't spoil if you don't know about them. The story in the film is okay, I really liked the dynamic of the league which was important as I found every member of the team to be fun and likable. However, the overall plot is incredibly formulaic and by the numbers in a bad way. There just isn't any twists or turns that I didn't expect and it bummed me out a bit. The script has a lighter tone to some of the other dc films with quite a few of the jokes landing. I didn't really feel like the drama delivered though, I never really felt like the world was truly in danger and I feel like the emphasis on humour too that away. The style of the film has pacing that moves quickly so you have to pay attention, I also liked a lot of the action scenes. This film does feel a bit choppy though, it feels like a few parts of the film are missing and some of the cgi looks unfinished and rushed out of the door, which I'm guessing can be blamed on the shift of directors in the late stages. Overall I enjoyed this film even though it isn't as good as maybe everyone wanted I feel like it is another solid film in the DC universe."

","Watching Justice league was a strange experience. On one hand were the expectations- viewing my favorite heroes on screen together was a goose-pimpling experience (give it up Marvel- Superman and Batman put together trumps all your flock). Also, after 3-4 middling ones, and one good movie, this was DC's make or break move. Marvel's big bucks is what DC was after, and true to their style, it was the movie that kind of summarized DC's Phase 1, much like The Avengers did for Marvel back in 2012. <br/><br/>So in short, Justice League was a movie that I desperately wanted to like. All DC had to do was to dish out a coherent yet original fare, which may seem simple to imagine given the wealth of material available, but difficult to execute- imagine Suicide Squad and Batman vs Superman and you get the idea.<br/><br/>The good news- it is a fun movie, mostly. Having two directors may have had its minuses, but it Whedon's addition surely lightened things up. Justice League picks up from where Batman vs Superman ended- with Superman's death. His death left a lasting impact- with Batman reducing his homicidal tendencies, Wonder Woman surfacing, and other metahumans stepping up. At the same time, the world is a place worse off without Superman, with people being afraid- a perfect time for parademons who feast on fear to appear, along with their master, Steppenwolf. Speaking of whom, is one of the movie's many mistakes. Bland, single track and CGI only- this guy the worst comic book villain in recent times. <br/><br/>""No protectors here. No Lanterns. No Kryptonian. This world will fall, like all the others""<br/><br/>Steppenwolf is here to steal the 3 mother boxes - one each in Atlantis, Themiscyra and Metropolis, which will help him conquer the world, and terraform it (yet again, DC?) amidst a lot of Mother, Unity mumbo jumbo. In a world without Superman, Batman realizes battling such an alien threat will require a league of superheroes, and goes about assembling his team, and when the team is proved inadequate, the focus shifts to reviving Superman, who understandably, tilts the balance by waving his little finger. But not without letting each of the Justice League members know who the boss is.<br/><br/>""I miss the days when one's biggest concern is exploding wind-up penguins.""<br/><br/>One of the many joys of watching Justice League is looking out for the easter eggs. Some of the Old Gods feature- Zeus and Artemis, as well as a Green Lantern. Deathstroke makes an appearance, Flash and Superman race, Gorilla Grod, Penguin and Captain Cold are referenced- oh there is so much more! But the flaws are equally many too- bad CGI, inconsistent tonal shifts that is associated with two distinctly different directors, wooden acting from Affleck, and Gadot, and most importantly, poor editing. <br/><br/>I really do not understand the 2 hour rule here, as this is a movie that could have been at-least 20 minutes longer to give some more backstory to some of the new characters. More so because it is the new characters who steal the show- nerdy Flash, macho Aquaman, and techie Cyborg. Justice League brings together heroes with a range of powers- mythology, science or as Batman would put it, money based. But unlike The Avengers, where all the heroes had already been introduced in solo movies, this introductory team up feels hurried and inadequate. But then Justice League was never the main event- everybody knew it once the villain was announced. As a build-up though, it works well. <br/><br/>Where does the DC Extended Universe go from here though? It is in the right direction at-last I think, but really needs better directors. As for Justice League the movie- depending on the mood in any particular day, viewers are likely to classify it as good or bad. It is a strange movie, as I said at the outset. 7/10"
"robinsonaustin-07490","7","0","3","20 November 2017"," The Justice League
","The DCEU....admittedly, I don't really care for these films. For those unaware, the DCEU is an attempt by Warner Brothers to have their own cinematic universe to compete with Disney's MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). The DCEU (DC Extended Universe) began with Man of Steel, a movie that I personally did not like. Then there was Batman v. Superman which was just outright terrible. The tone was conveyed poorly, characters like Wonder Woman were only there for the sake of being there, Doomsday had no reason to be in this movie, etc. There was Suicide Squad which had characters that you didn't feel compelled to care for, the plot was confusing, Leto's take on the Joker only appeared for about five minutes....Wonder Woman was actually pretty good, though one part of me wanted the writers to push for her movie first before Batman v. Superman because it would've made more sense for her to be in that one. Overall, my qualms with the DCEU is that at some points, it tries to be too serious which makes it difficult to really care about whatever is going on, and the worst part is that they try to build their universe rather than making a good movie.<br/><br/>With that being said....Justice League. While not bad, it has a multitude of issues. The plot is still hard to follow. Essentially, you have these three boxes referred to as the Mother Boxes that when brought together, results in major devastation. Trillions of years before the main story line, a villain named Steppenwolf tried to invade the Earth, but was defeated by the Atlantians, Amazonians, and early man. Each one takes a respective box into hiding, guarding them in the event that Steppenwolf would return to obtain them. Alright to get this out of the way, Steppenwolf is a terrible villain. He is generic, boring, and he really has no large goal beyond destroying the Earth for reasons no less than because I'm evil. Really, a majority of the villains from the DCEU films thus far are either poorly written or boring. I guess that's one thing that the DCEU has with the MCU that is having boring and bland villains (though the MCU did slowly get better with representing their villains examples being Ego, Vulture, and Hela). Because of Steppenwolf's blandness, I had to look up what role he played in the comics. For one, he was actually Darkseid's uncle. Something that I don't recall the film bringing up.<br/><br/>As for the Justice League themselves. Well, Ben Affleck. It's weird, Affleck was initially praised for his role as Batman...well, except for being overly trigger happy with murdering and branding criminals. In this film, he honestly came off as a whiner with how ""Oh, Superman is the only one who can bring this team together"" among other gripes. Wonder Woman felt the same (at least to me). Now, for the other members of the Justice League. Barrey Allen (The Flash) was a likable character. He was adorable, had several quirky moments, and you can kind of get the character's reasons for joining the Justice League. He also has a personal tragedy: his mother was murdered years ago, and his father was framed for it. So part of his motivation was trying to figure out a way to liberate him. Cyborg I found as meh. After an accident, his father gave him artificial body parts to reconstruct him. While I do get that he sees himself as a monster, he just came off as too moping and selfish. Aqua Man....I felt they were trying too hard to make Aqua Man look cool. True, he had some funny moments here and there, but I didn't see much of a reason as to why he joined the league. I guess my reasons for finding these characters okay was because they were not given their own films to flesh their characters out more. One thing that the Marvel Cinematic Universe did right was having the origin story for their heroes first before slowly integrating them into the Avengers. That way, we know how these characters tick, and their alliance made more sense. With for Superman himself, while I won't give away how he came back after the events of Batman v. Superman, one aspect that I liked was how he finally felt like Superman. Superman is not usually depicted as being dark and moody, so here, it's nice to see that he was closer to the modern take on the Kryptonian.<br/><br/>With the plot, while it was more simplistic, it was still somewhat confusing. While they gave a brief description of the Mother Boxes, they don't fully delve into what makes them that important enough to keep them out of Steppenwolf's clutches. The manner in which the league brought Superman back from the dead was convoluted, and it was overall clunky.<br/><br/>So, while it is by no means the worst out of the DCEU, it still had its issues that kept it from being perfect. But it was great when they weren't trying to push for an expansion of the shared universe the films take place in."

"jcramadi","7","0","1","19 November 2017"," Justice League is a step in the right direction!
","JUSTICE LEAGUE is a highly entertaining movie that grabs your attention and doesn't let you go. Compared to many superhero movies this one is among the most action-packed. It literally an action movie from beginning to the end. <br/><br/>The best thing about this movie is the dynamic relationship between all the JL members. There is a sense of comradeship, dedication and commitment amongst the characters: WW and Batman, WW and Cyborg, Batman and Flash, Batman and Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg, even briefly Cyborg and Aquaman, Superman and Batman, FLASH, WW. I liked that this wasn't that team squabbling which I think is so cliché. Rather the team actually gels quite well. There are some team friction especially between WW and Batman over what to do with Superman and it adds gravity to the movie. This friction isn't over the top but natural for a team that actually gels and is dedicated to each other. It's actually quite different from the Avengers.<br/><br/>The tone is actually quite refreshing here as it embraces some humour from all its characters. However, I do miss the darkness that Man of Steel brought to the screen. The JL animation series were actually quite dark, if not, darker than Marvel animation series. This is what sets it apart from the MCU. JL does have that darkness but it is however swirled with the lightheartness.<br/><br/>The cool thing is that each character brought some sense of fun to the movie. Each character contributed in many ways to the movement of this movie and because of that every character got some sort of development that made me care about them. <br/><br/>The action sequences were just nothing short of awesome greatness. It reminded me of the Justice League animated series. The cinematography is very impressive and the angles were very well done when the action was revving up. Towards the 3rd act the action was just pure adrenaline with the explosions, the racing, the flying, the fighting, the saving the civilians, the parademons. It was just one crazy 3rd act. <br/><br/>My favorite scene and I think the best scene in the movie was the fight between Superman and JL. Everything about how he came back to the fighting the JL was so intense. Of course I think they could have done his resurrection MUCH better, but it was his interaction with the JL especially Batman that made for a really intense situation. This scene made me scared for JL because of his incredible power. They really emphasize on the power of Kryptonians. Among the best action sequences of any superhero movie.<br/><br/>I really wanted them to dig into the Fourth World. They didn't get into where Steppenwolf and his Parademons come from. They didn't reveal much about the legend of the Fourth World, the history, the New Gods, boomtubes, and more explanation on the mother boxes. I believe the revelations about the Fourth World would have created much needed urgency for this movie that was really missing. Steppenwolf is a great villain that although an afterthought, could have been made a compelling character that could impose fear and awe in the face of JL and the people of Earth. Unfortunately he just became more of a disposable villain. He was however extremely powerful as he is a New God and every time he was on the screen he commanded that attention (something X-men's Apocalypse failed to do). <br/><br/>Not incorporating more revelations of the Fourth World, JL did not feel as epic as it should have been. This was suppose to be an event of gigantic proportions. Because the urgency and stakes were nearly not felt as it were in Man of Steel, it lacked that epic sense of all these heroes joining into a team. The reason for the team would have been of major proportions if the threat was larger than life. The Fourth World lore is larger than life and was so neglected here and its a shame. <br/><br/>The villains plan was already seen in Man of Steel...terraforming. I didn't care so much that Steppenwolf wanted the mother boxes and that unfortunate because the Mother Boxes is a massive deal in the the DC lore and I felt they were downplayed and not given much emphasis or importance rather seem almost non-valuable. Also what happen to them in the end????<br/><br/>I really loved this movie and I want to own the ultimate edition on blu-ray, but it was not as epic as it should have been. It was extremely entertaining and for all its flaws it did the Justice League right. They are going in the right direction and I hope they will now take their time to flesh out the stories for the DCEU. <br/><br/>7.8/10 because it is highly entertaining, pure action movie, and the dynamic portrayal of JL team."
"aazzam","7","0","1","18 November 2017"," loved the team, let down by the reappearance of superman
","i really enjoyed this film but was most excited by the development, wonder woman and aquaman especially who would make good team leaders if bruce wayne were knocked out or left. barry allen aka the flash provided the best humour, cyborg was very interesting but needed moretime. i liked the effects and action but wasn't completely sold on steppenwolf as a villain, maybe making him all cgi was a mistake, he didn't seem quite real, quite there, this diluted the effect of his appearances. using a real actor would have made for something much more menacing, but some fatalities might have had to be added to increase the threat. i was bored when superman appears, he overpowers everyone else and answers the threat far too quickly almost by himself, which depletes the development given to the other team members and turning the later scenes into another superman movie. they might narrowly, very narrowly have done better on their own without him and the movie might have been more gripping and edge of the seat which it was until then, due to steppenwolf's power. the two extra scenes in the end credits, the very last in particular, were good and set things up nicely for the next movie. hopefully superman will be a team player and will really need the help of the others, maybe he can be rendered powerless in some way (kryptonite?) or given some real problems to solve which he cannot do alone. he really needs to struggle or else the outcome becomes predictable."
"mistela67","7","0","1","17 November 2017"," Non stop action - Short on story
","For those wanting a good visual cinematic experience, Justice League (JL) fits the bill.<br/><br/>There are very few extended scenes were something isn't fighting, flying, or hacking up something else. And that's not a bad thing. The gathering of the team was effective, but not great. And the establishment of the antagonist followed suit. <br/><br/>You will not get a moving storyline here. It's going to pretty much be your standard ancient, frozen god-like thing waking up and wanting to take over the world. You've seen it before, you'll see it again. <br/><br/>There is a bit of side story with SPOILER the resurrection of Super Man. They have to contain him, knowing he may not be the nice guy he once was. He isn't, for a spell, and seeing a newly risen and very confused Superman own the rest of the JL in a one-sided fight is interesting. I can already tell that this group won't be able to pull off a Capt. America Civil War sort of melee; the hierarchy is clear, with Superman sans kryptonite clearly on the top, Wonder Woman a notch beneath him, and then its et al.<br/><br/>Speakiing of Wonder Woman, the best scene in the movie, in my opinion, is when the Amazons are defending the cube. There's so much to explore with the Warrior Women, and I hope Wonder Woman 2 involves some extended scenes with these attractive women fighting whatevers.<br/><br/>Beyond that, JL lacks the personality, and pazazz, of The Avengers. Superman and Batman are still brooders, although they are trying to spruce of Superman a bit. The Flash is too similar to how Spiderman acts. The Cyborg is boring, Aquaman is one dimensional. Wonder Woman is the only one that is interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Justice Leauge does sort of borrow, if not steal, from other movies. There is a scene that copies the beginning of Lord of The Rings- Fellowship of the Ring. I mean, not only is that particular part of the storyline similar to how the rings were distributed, but even the shots/scenes are similar. It wasn't subtle either, and I wonder why it wasn't. <br/><br/>Regardless of the few flaws, JL is a good time. Gil Gardo is eye candy for the guys, and I guess Aquaman is eye candy for women. <br/><br/>I don't know how many movies will be in this franchise, but they will need to bring other characters in to sustain things. <br/><br/>7/10, as long as you don't mind the cookie-cutter storyline."

","When a footy team is in a relegation struggle a new manager often comes in, and their primary job is to make sure the team no longer suck. They're rarely great straight away but they stop shipping goals by the ton and looking like a disparate bunch of nobodies. This feels analogous to Justice League. BvS was an atrocious mess of bad decisions and rotten characterisations that would tumble down any league structure like a stone. Now WB have presented us with an unremarkable, but by no means bad movie designed to steady the ship and shore up the defence. Vaguely amusing with flashes of actual flair, I had a decent time watching the guys come together. Yes, the tone is a little awkward at times but at least there is a little light, and if Steppenwolf easily wins least effective villain in the history of comic book movies, and if the plot is as interesting as washing dishes, Wonder Woman, Batman and yes, even Superman, hit some relatively high notes. And I absolutely loved it whenever Elfman's score reprised the Bat's theme from the Burton films. You can have worse times at the cinema this year. Relegation avoided :)"
"holden-73235","8","0","3","20 November 2017"," More of the practical, less of the CGI
","So lets get straight into this..... JL is not a bad film at all, does it have its flaws ... yes (We'll get to these in time). However these flaws are minuscule in the grand scheme of things and I believe that this film was a step in the right direction for the DCU.<br/><br/>Just so you know which angle I'm coming from, its important that I tell you that I'm a fan of all comic book films and that I'm not just some stupid fan boy who wants to see the DCU conquer the world of Marvel. I like both properties just as much.<br/><br/>I've been a big fan of Man of steel, Wonder woman and BvS the extended cut (which took some time to get my head around) And I feel as though Justice league fits nicely into the DCU.<br/><br/>I found no flaws with any of the characters portrayals within this film, I feel as though the acting was on point and that the chemistry between each other was amazing. Ben Affleck as Batman was superb and Ezra Miller's take on Barry Allen was both hilarious and enjoyable to watch. I did feel that Superman stole the show and found Henry Cavill's portrayal to be charming, heroic and somewhat resembled the late Christopher Reeve (Which is a good thing in my eyes). Another aspect that I really enjoyed was the score of this film, Danny Elfman does a fantastic job of mixing the old batman and superman themes into the score which overwhelmed me with a sense of nostalgia.<br/><br/>Some aspects which I didn't enjoy were that the use of CGI in this film was messy and overused in parts, I'm not sure if this was a result of re-shoots, but with a film which had the budget of $300,000,000 id expect something more extravagant. This leads me on to my next point, The villain in this film is a CGI blunder if ever there was one, it was unnecessary to have Steppenwolf as a CGI character, that's not to say that his voice over wasn't great because it really is, but overall the character left me feeling a little underwhelmed and this could of been averted if the character was made to feel more real.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is fun, if you go into the cinema thinking its going to be a turd the chances are you'll convince yourself it is one, however if you go into it expecting little I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised."
"Melvin_Tigerfists","6","0","3","20 November 2017"," Decent, but Disappointing
","I am one of the few who has enjoyed the quirky darkness of the DCEU films, flaws and all. Marvel's films are just about pitch perfect, and I love that, but I liked the fact that the DC films took risks and set out to do something different. So it was not welcome news to me that Suicide Squad reshoots were being done to make it more funny, or that Justice League was going to move in the direction of being more lighthearted.<br/><br/>The primary flaws with Justice League are as follows:<br/><br/><ul><li>The ""lighthearted and funny"" icing is applied scattershot across the whole film. As a result, they lost some of the distinctiveness of the characters. Let the dedicated comic relief characters like the Flash carry that aspect of the film. Batman should be dark, driven and frightening. This Batman was practically in Joel Schumacher territory compared to the excellent portrayal in Batman vs Superman.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The villain is an action figure. Totally unconvincing, totally disposable.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Because there has been no investment in solo films, only Superman has some genuine context and depth, and even that has been rushed. The guy has been alive, dead and alive again in three movies, only one of which was his own film.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why does Aquaman have such a cowboy attitude? Would Aquaman really throw an empty liquor bottle into the ocean? Why is Cyborg so upset about not being dead? Did he have, like, a promising future in football or something? Who knows? They just show up, and off they go.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending is superhero movie paint-by-numbers. If I see another film where the superheroes have to fight through total chaos near a giant beam of energy going into the sky in order to save earth from an interdimensional/alien threat, I am going to lose my mind. They all look and feel and end exactly the same.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The movie just feels very superficial and flat. Knowing that Affleck has yet to make a Batman film and they are already losing a grip on what made his character work is depressing. I can see why he wants out.</li></ul><br/><br/>What worked:<br/><br/><ul><li>Superman, once they take 5 hyper-compressed minutes to straighten him out, is pretty awesome. Batman's contingency plan is fairly surprising. I expected Kryptonite weaponized something-or-other.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Godot as Wonder Woman is still working well. Her fight scenes are not as impressive as in the solo film, but she makes it through Justice League with the gains of previous appearance intact. Her banter with Batman and how she responds late in the film are highlights that bring some genuine forward movement and depth to the character.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Flash is well-defined as a personality. He still suffers from minimal context and history, but it works for the purposes of the film.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Given the production challenges, the movie holds together well and manages to get some traction.</li></ul><br/><br/>In short, this is a barely adequate film by creators who have lost their confidence and are trying to mimic the successes of other franchises instead of continuing to blaze a new path. I'm pretty bummed about that."

In fact, we weren't even given enough of a backstory, everything was just rushed through. I thought they over did it with the special effects, or they didn't do a good enough job with it that made it all feel a bit fake. Aqua-man was cool, Wonder Woman was cool, Batman seems out of place at times, Flash was trying to be comic relief, Cyborg's like a side character, and Superman is always just too powerful. I still gave this movie a 7, because i like most of the characters, and I was mostly entertained. DC really need to step it up a notch if it wants to compete with Marvel."

After all, ""Dawn of Justice"" was an horrendous movie, maybe the worst superhero flick I was ever forced to endure, but Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman almost saved that one in spite of Affleck's poor attempts to be the Dark Knight, right? <br/><br/>To be honest, Affleck douched less this time around, and Gadot was the utter hot badass we've all come to know and love. Flash was really fun and much-needed comic relief among all the badasssery oozing from everyone else. All in all, this was a good movie, better than anticipated, but I'd still contend that Affleck needs to be replaced. He's just not the right guy to be Batman. 7 Stars."

","11/19/17. Saw this in 2D in the theater. A good movie to watch on the big screen. Not sure if it would be worth paying for 3D as there was enough good action as it is. I originally decided to watch this because Gal Gadot would be in it, and she's on a roll, even though the Batman vs. Superman movie was probably the most stupidest comic book superhero movie ever. So, this movie exceeded my expectations. Very smart for them to start off with Wonder Woman in action and then slowly develop an origins-based introduction to the less known characters. I really like Miller's take on the Flash. His earlier movies play to his choices of quirky and troubled teen roles. Here he is a kid who feels so lucky to be in the presence of all these super-heroes. I also like his somewhat PG-13 adoration of Wonder Woman. All in all, the Justice League is off to a promising start. If they can try and keep it a little more serious than cartoon-y I think potential Justice League sequels will do well,. Although I still find it somewhat strange to see Affleck as Batman, although he is much, much better in this one that in the previous stupid one."
"CANpatbuck3664","7","0","2","19 November 2017"," Justice League Improves Upon Similar DC Efforts and Continues to Take the DC Universe in a More Positive Direction
","All of Zack Snyder's movies share strengths and weaknesses and when you talk about what he does well, action scenes/set pieces are always at the top of the list. This movie adds upon that, they deliver what you want from this type of movie. Two scenes stuck out to me, the first fight between our heroes and Steppenwolf and of course in the finale. They add new wrinkles for some of our returning heroes and they highlight what each member can do pretty well. The CGI is good and it never felt overloaded (at least for this genre). They also go to new locations that despite the fact that they're entirely CGI, I thought they looked interesting and relatively believable.<br/><br/>I want to touch upon the return of Superman (its not a spoiler, they show it in the trailers). I really enjoyed how they decided to handle the impact of his demise (even though Bruce Wayne has a crazy 180 degree turn in his attitude that seemed to skirt around the entire point of BvS) and we get some quiet and understated scenes with Lois Lane and Martha Kent grieving and bonding together. Even when they decide to get gooey sweet with his reunion with Lois, I thought they sold it. Instead of coming across as unemotional and distant, Clark has a lot of emotion in this and he even made me chuckle with some of his lines. He played off his Justice League teammates really well and although he seemed to be playing on a different level than his teammates, they utilize his full power set and I applaud Snyder and his team for changing up their approach.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise of the movie was how much I enjoyed the new members in the Justice League. Cyborg was a grounded character (at least in temperament) and even though he was full of angst, his abilities were interesting and I thought his relationship with his dad was emotional without being overbearing. Aquaman benefited from casting Jason Momoa but they are very tongue-in-cheek about his abilities and yet there was never a point I was about to start laughing at his inclusion. The Flash wasn't nearly as funny as the creative team thought he was but Ezra Miller shone through it as an actor and I liked how they decided to use him as a character. Add in that commissioner Gordon had a nice cameo and that smaller returning characters like Lois Lane, Martha Kent and Alfred Pennyworth were all nicely sprinkled in, they did a good job handling so many characters.<br/><br/>This is a big cast and while I can't give each of them their own paragraph, I'll do my best to give my thoughts on the performances. I already talked about Henry Cavill, he improved across the board. Ben Affleck isn't bad here but he suffers from the fact Batman is written a little more bland. Gal Gadot was also stronger in her solo effort but she's still good. Ezra Miller actually succeeds despite the material, Ray Fisher is surprisingly strong as Cyborg and even though Arthur Curry is Jason Momoa doing his thing, he's a charming guy and his charisma makes his character memorable. Lois Lane and Diane Lane are both really good with what they're given. Amber Heard was decent in her small bit and I really liked Joe Morton as Silas Stone.<br/><br/>The negatives of this film are pronounced but they weren't deal breakers. The first and most notable for me was the cringe inducing dialogue carries over from BvS. There are so many awkward lines and when the movie tries to be funny, I thought it fell on its face about 80-90% of the time. To be fair, there were some good lines too but I thought they were lacklustre for the most part. Some of my favourite characters from previous DC properties felt underutilized or shoved to the background. Batman comes off as a self-centred jerk for large portions of the movie and other than the action scenes, Wonder Woman's part is either to lecture the other members of the team or brood over the loss of Steve Trevor (the movie also doesn't do a great job explaining why she didn't help in other conflicts over the last century). Steppenwolf also made for a pretty underwhelming villain. I've seen worse (Malekith from Thor: The Dark World comes to mind) but this movie is built more around the heroes and the villain isn't the focal point.<br/><br/>People either rail against the DC Universe or they love it completely. I've been down the middle on it for the most part (I gave Man of Steel, Suicide Squad and Wonder Woman 8s or 9s, Batman v Superman was a disappointment but I still gave it a 6) and despite its flaws, this is still a solid movie. I might not be popular for saying this but I thought some of the players in BvS took some notes on what worked and what didn't and applied that to this movie, which I congratulate them for. They do a decent job setting up the new members of the team, the action scenes are good from beginning to end and I liked what they decided to do with Superman. Depending on the direction WB studios and DC decide to go, there's material and momentum to build off of in Justice League. We'll just have to see what happens, if you're a DC fan or you're craving some big action with superheroes, this will fill that spot. I would actually give this a 7.5/10 but I can't go a full 8 on it so I'm rounding down to a 7/10."
"burlesonjesse5","7","0","2","19 November 2017"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Justice League
","""I had a dream. It was the end of the world"". So quips Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne, the main corroborator in Justice League (my latest review).<br/><br/>Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg join forces to try and stop Steppenwolf and his evil band of Parademons (aliens that look like insects). That's the gist of ""League"", a flick possibly made for the younger, more zealot, comic crowd.<br/><br/>Look, I don't pretend to know a lot about films of the DC publisher nature. And to be truthful, I'm not the biggest fan of said films. You know what though, I sorta dug 2017's Justice League. Rooted in comic relief, saturated in scorched, cartoon violence, and containing an all-star selection of established superheroes, ""League"" is just plain fun.<br/><br/>Justice League at a budget of roughly $300 million, is supposedly one of the most expensive movies ever made. It makes sense. Every shot is littered with special effects and there's also a host of high- profile actors that just had to get paid by Warner Bros. (Affleck, Jeremy Irons, Connie Nielsen, J. K. Simmons, and Diane Lane to name a few).<br/><br/>""League's"" director is Zack Snyder. I liked his latest and Superman v Batman: Dawn of Justice but for different reasons. ""Dawn of Justice"" is dark, with broodiness, a plot over plot stature, and the emergence of Ben Affleck as a credible Batman. Justice League on the other hand, is goofy, not as epic, and not quite as self-serious. <br/><br/>Snyder, who had a little help from Joss Whedon (Joss contributed some re-shoots towards post-production), provides ""League"" with a solid use of three dimensional space. There's also some tighter editing and some tighter storytelling than in his previous endeavors. ""League"" is trimmed down to a swift two hours. It weaves all the superhuman's stories until everyone comes together for a merrymaking, elaborate battle. Bottom line: If you liked this summer's Spider-Man: Homecoming, you'll probably embrace the jocular Justice League as well. Rating: 3 stars."

Apart from these problems the action scenes are spectacular, the characters are super charismatic and the villain is what they need to be for the rise of this league of heroes. The soundtrack left a bit to be desired, taking the 1989 batman theme and the theme of the orchestrated wonder woman (which was beautiful) the rest of the film's track does not impress. So being a justice league is fun but it does not impress, it has its negative and positive points and ends up being a balanced film and a new beginning for this universe."
"jmsf-07261","8","0","4","19 November 2017"," Good movie!
","Well, I think that it would be a lie if I said that it was an outstanding movie. The actors were OK, and so was the argument. The development from the characters were expected to be none due to the future movies, but the connection in the team was weak. In fact, the new Flash was, for me, the only good new in the movie. On the other hand, the special effects and the sound were as good as it can be expected from Zack Znyder movies, which means amazing. But it was just that, the villain is very weak and that is a very bad mistake in any good movie. Please bring Christopher Nolan back, those were the days of good DC movie such as Batman trilogy and Man of Steel."

","Although I liked the movie, it wasn't good. The script is weak, with a completely disposable villain and story, without any impact for the series' future. I laughed at some jokes and I could watch it and follow the story, and is this part that i call it ""good"". For the franchise's future I want a greater focus on villains, with acts that bring permanent consequences for the series."

","The movie wasn't awful and you're hearing this from a Marvel fan. I genuinely appreciate DC films for what they are and how gritty they can be. However, Justice League to me was a big flop and misrepresentation of DC films; it wasn't that good. The story was so wishy- washy that it was hard to even comprehend what exactly was going on. There was this story between a villain and heroes but to me I felt like it was too cliché. It wasn't a bad film in terms of its choreography but there were a lot of CGI effects used that almost looked too noticing. It was hard to keep your eyes off of Superman's top lip. Regardless, it wasn't awful, but it DEFINITELY wasn't good either. The film dragged for way too long with no real show for action until the climax of the film, but even then, it was still lame. I feel that Justice League let down its fan base to such an extent that it was disgusting. In the end, I found Justice League to be a big disappointment (an expected one as well) and I wish it would have proved me wrong. It's worth the watch if you're into corny hero films, other than that, not too good."
"zia-adam2","7","0","1","19 November 2017"," It's good, but that's all it is.
","I'm a fan of the DC Comic Universe (The Green Lantern being my favorite), so I've gone in to every movie with high expectations. After Suicide Squad, those hopes pretty much went down the toilet. Still, Man of Steel made me believe in Superman again, so I gave the movie a chance.<br/><br/>If Suicide Squad brought those expectations down, then Justice League slowly brought them back up, making this a good movie, but that's all it is.<br/><br/>First, the bad stuff: The villain (Steppenwolf) is very generic and forgettable (and it calls upon parallels in the Marvel Comics Universe), making it cliché. A terrible villain, with a powerful weapon, seeking to destroy the status quo and become ruler. The Hero is only as powerful as the Villain.<br/><br/>The CGI: I've always said this, but I believe that CGI is one of the things that, if not done correctly, will rob the audience of emotional impact. Suspension of disbelief is very important when telling a story, and there were moments when I felt I was watching a video game. Superman's MOUTH?!?!?!?! What the hell happened to Henry Cavill's mouth to require CGI? It's bad enough they do that to his cape, but his mouth?!?! It made me curious about the story, and not the one on the screen, but the one between Henry Cavill and the studio (Again, suspension of disbelief). Watch the first two installments of the Alien franchise, and tell me different. Bring the CGI down a notch (or ten)!!!!! The humour (Part One): Batman vs. Superman was dark. It needed humour. I get it. I simply felt that they made certain characters too quippy, and unnecessarily so (The Flash, for example).<br/><br/>The delivery: There were moments when this movie felt too antiseptic. I can accept it to a certain degree, but certain moments could have used that dark and complex delivery to make it more impactful emotionally. It made parts of the movie less inspired than other superhero movies I've seen.<br/><br/>The story: Because they felt that complexities may be difficult to understand, I get that they wanted to keep the story simple. That being said, complexity doesn't mean complication. Rick & Morty deals with that complexity all the time, and on every count, they're able to simplify it with a line of dialogue, or even a split-second image.<br/><br/>Now, the Good, because there were a lot of good elements to this movie that excite me for future installments.<br/><br/>The characters exhibit their trademark complexities with the presence and dignity they deserve. I liked them. There were moments when certain characters were over-sexualized (Aquaman and Wonder Woman), but I didn't put too much emphasis on their physiques until they were given context. They showed their powers. Fair enough. I also liked how they heightened the vulnerabilities of certain characters (Batman, The Flash, and Cyborg), and I connected with them even more as a result of them. Good for you! They can be hit (and in certain cases, with more than just Kryptonite).<br/><br/>The story: There were certain sequences when my jaw was dropped. The Superman Resurrection was indeed one of them. I had always wanted to see a Dark Superman battling the Justice League, if only for a moment. I hope this isn't the last we've seen of Dark Superman. Also, the little pieces of the DC Universe teasing us in the moments of exposition made me want to see more (The Green Lantern Power Rings, Deathstroke and the Founding of The Secret Society of Super Villains, leading potentially to the Infinite Crisis). The Extra-Credit scenes in Justice League do for DC what they also do for Marvel. I think that they're setting the stage for a very human struggle set on Earth, and I think we need The humour: Even though the movie was too quippy, there were the moments where the humour hit its mark, and heightened what would have been very boring scenes. The Flash is funny, I'm not doubting that for a moment.<br/><br/>All in all, it was fun, but flawed. I enjoyed it, but I wasn't blown away. I don't doubt that there will be a sequel to this, preceded by movies exploring the individual members of the League. I liked Wonder Woman, and I look forward to Aquaman, The Flash, Cyborg and The Batman (especially given the reveal of Deathstroke in that very last scene with Lex Luthor, a twist that, although was very predictable, was still very entertaining)."

","As someone who absolutely hated Man of Steel, Batman V Superman, and Suicide Squad (which was my 2nd worst movie of 2015), I can proudly say that Justice league just barely won me over.<br/><br/>this film isn't the greatest or that good for that matter, it actually has a ton of flaws that could have crippled the film if everything else wasn't done well.tons of pacing problems, the occasional continuity error and some paper thin characters could have torn the film to shreds and possibly made it unwatchable. luckily to balance a lot of these films flaws out, the action sequences are loads of fun to watch (and there's a lot of em), most of the characters are likable, or at least fun to watch, and the team itself's absolutely fantastic chemistry.

"virindra","6","0","1","19 November 2017"," Average movie, not original.
","The thing I liked about the Dark Knight trilogy was that it was refreshing, new, Original. We have seen a lot of cartoons or comics that have been changed into improved cartoons we call movies nowadays. We saw The avengers, where a couple of individuals have to team up to save the day. At first it doesn't work, but for the sake of mankind they have to. Then we had Suicide squad, where a couple of individuals have to team up to save the day. The same happened with the x-men. Now the writers of Justice League had the chance to giver the viewers a whole different kind of story, maybe an Original one, but still they choose to invent a couple of individuals which have to team up to save the day (I just copy pasted that line and changed it a little, like the writers did of this movie).<br/><br/>There were a lot of questions I asked myself while watching this movie. Like in the beginning how did wonder woman end up at the Libra statue? Did she jump on top of it or did she climb the statue, and why? To be honest, I am more a Marvel fan. The Marvel movies are more fun to watch. For instance, Marvel's x-men has Quick-silver. He is very fast and the scenes are funny to watch, and very well made. I had the feeling they were trying to copy paste Quick-silver into The Flash. Only at the end of the movie, the last short scene with The Flash and Superman, thát was funny. Why not in the movie? I think DC misses the marks on so many levels. I did not enjoy Batman-Superman and Wonderwoman. The movies are very promising, but not the heart and soul of The Dark Knight Trilogy or the Marvel movies. Maybe DC tries to be different, but different is not Always better."
"rtbradford","Null","0","1","19 November 2017"," Enjoyable. Not Great, Not terrible
","Spoiler Alert!!<br/><br/>As a kid, I grew up reading Justice League of America comics, so I've been looking forward to this flick. On the whole, it was enjoyable. It wasn't nearly as dark or serious as The Dark Knight movies or Batman Vs. Superman. And there were no surprises. The story was so predictable that my 8 year old said he knew everything that would happen. There wasn't much (or really any) character development either. We did get some backstory on Cyborg, but almost nothing on The Flash (though we all know his story from comics or the TV show) or Aquaman, who remained an enigma - part angry surfer-type dude and part something entirely unexplored.<br/><br/>But for all that, it was a still an enjoyable film. The story moved quickly, the characters, while shallow, were likable and the fight scenes weren't excessive. Besides, it's a comic book on film; not Remains of the Day. I don't know why the critics were so harsh. It was on par with the Avengers last movie and the various X-Men flicks and has pretty much the same story as those (evil guy appears out of nowhere, tries to seize/destroy the world and is stopped by the heroes who variously bicker and bond in the process).<br/><br/>If you grew up reading DC comics or just like super hero movies, ignore the critics and go see it."

"abhishekshrestha10","5","0","1","19 November 2017"," I loved it ... laughed at every joke and had the neardiest time of my life.
","Humans are naive, we are primitive beings, we don't really understand what we want. We might be under the impression that we want that new, shiny thing, but when that thing is finally ours we regret wanting it, start finding flaws in it and try to discard it. Because we are primitive beings and I know this because I experienced it, in myself for the first time and now I know. The feeling of satisfaction is only an illusion till the next shiny,new thing arrives to replace the old one. And once that happens it's difficult to go back. It is only by creating something new and completely different can one make a difference and establish a false sense of satisfaction amongst people. <br/><br/>The first time I saw Justice League I was brimming with excitement, I don't even remember the number of years I had waited for this to happen so I went in hoping to see,... I don't know something cathartic, maybe. Something that I could compare to the works of other directors that I love. So needless to say I came out of the movie theatre feeling a little disappointed. And as I lay in bed that night and I thought about the things that I disliked about the movie and except for #MUSTACHEGATE and some choppy editing to make the movie under 2 hours. I could not think of anything else. Just the fact that it seemed to resemble a few marvel movies and did-not have the dynamic storytelling of David Fincher or Darren Aronofsky cannot make a movie bad? And that too a movie that has characters that I adore. So decided to watch it again and now I understood why WB wanted it to be under 2 hours because it's easier to rewatch. Which seems like a dick move, but works, anyways I saw it the day after and I was waltzing out of the theatre. <br/><br/>Now that I did-not sit there comparing it to other movies and complaining about some scenes resembling other marvel movies. I f***ing loved it ... laughed at every joke and had the neardiest time of my life. Seriously this is a movie that will give, comicbook neards and superhero geek, the biggest orgasms of their lives. And will provide non comicbook buffs with ample entertainment through its visually stunning action pieces, inspirational characters and witty humor. And credit where credit is due, Zach Snyder, love him/hate him you cannot deny his visual language of creating ""moments"",well choreographed stylistic slow-motion scenes, is both unique and awesome. These ""moments"" are used elegantly in long action set pieces that are amazing to witness. <br/><br/>The only people to dislike this movie will be so called ""movie critics"" who are pretentious enough to dislike a movie just because their lives are sad . And seriously, you don't wanna be that guy? Do you? <br/><br/>See now, I know people will jump to conclusions and say stupid things like, the first scene of the movie was a total ripoff of Spiderman Homecoming and Steppenwolf had that Loki scene like in the first Avengers movie and why is DC making funny movies now? As if the creators of MARVEL movies are the first people on this planet ever to implement the ""found footage"" technique and add a few narcissistic dialogues for the arrogant bad guy.<br/><br/>But if you are a person who says these kinda things then you missed the whole point of the movie. It's not about that... it is about restoring hope, order, peace and harmony in a world without Superman. It is about the coming together of meta human(s), Demi-God(s) and a person who dresses like a bat, to save the world and restore the hope that was lost. Hope that the age of heroes is here and mankind will be safe even without Superman.<br/><br/>And boy was I digging the dynamism and the interactions of this team. <br/><br/>Bruce and Diana being the senior members got all the others together and lead form the front. Cyborg was all business and had his guard up in the beginning, as one may expect him to be after the changes that he goes through, but he found his ground and was comfortable in the end. I enjoyed every second of The Flash this movie gave me and Barry Allen was my favourite character in the movie. We're shown the traumas that these characters have faced. Some of it is beyond our understanding just because we've never had to face something that horrible but we can relate to some of it. We've all had to face the loss of a loved one and that emotion of grief always changes something. And it is shown beautifully, it gives these larger than life characters a sense of humanity and morality. Aquaman was given less screen time than the rest but he shined in the moments he was given.And that brings me to Superman. He was, I think, out of all the 3 DCEU movies he's been in , the closest to his comicbook self in this movie. The love he has for Lois, the concrete almost stupidly stubborn belief, in the good that humanity can do. He's Superman. If you can just focus on his eyes instead of his upper lip. You'll be fine. <br/><br/>Which brings me to the flaws. The CGI in some scenes could've have been better or just maybe unnecessary. The way they bring back Superman was a little... I don't you'll see. <br/><br/>Even hardcore marvel lovers should love this movie because if you don't then why do you like marvel movies? And if you don't like marvel movies how are you a marvel fanatic? A nice ""Paradox"" to have DC.<br/><br/>Enough said. PEACE"

","I just saw the film last night. It's clear that there were major changes, including all of Superman's scenes (re: CGI upper lip). For what they had to work with, it was a damn good film. I honestly think people want to dislike the film for a number of reasons. Mainly being overshadowed by Marvel and the stumbling start of the DC film franchise. I think the DC film franchise suffers from lack of direction, a la Kevin Feige-esque producer to control the direction of the franchise. Also, Zack Snyder directing MOS, BvS & JL. Share the creative process with other writers and directors. That's what makes the MCU strong. Hiring Joss Whedon definitely pulled a rabbit out of the hat. The tone was lightened, the story line was reinforced, it was funny and action packed. It made for an enjoyable experience. Don't put too much weight in the critic's reviews.

The story does seem all over the place, and I would have loved to see more backstory on our main cast (like single movies for them before this film came out), but the fan in me just loved it beyond all that! We had laughs, there were some epic moments such as Superman's return (and when he freaking owned his teammates while he wasn't himself, displaying how really powerful he is) and also when the whole gang fought the primary threat. Although the main villain is cool in his own way, he is a bit forgettable, but it's nothing short of what you'd see in a Marvel movie to be honest, so I let is slide. This film had a good balance of light and dark scripting, and it was an overall pleasure to view. I hope DC will only get better from here!"

","First - this is not Shakespeare, it's not a masterful drama, or sci fi film. It's a comic book film. It's meant to entertain, and that it does.<br/><br/>I have seen BvS several times, and still both enjoy and hate it. I loved Wonder Woman. This film falls short of the latter, but is far better than the first. The action is fun, the dialogue is amusing when it should be, and the characters have a range between them. Are things fully fleshed out? No - you're dealing with new characters for the screen, new villains, and a new shift in how they all deal with each other. What I liked was that balance. The movie never tries to be more than it is - entertainment and fun. With that, it wins. Sure, the Amazonian armor is misogynistic given the designs were changed AFTER Wonder Woman was a hit (as seen all over the web last week). Sure physics is tossed out the window. It still stands well even with those flaws. Go see it if you'd like some fun."
"bibingraj","5","0","1","19 November 2017"," Awesome Action!!! Go see it!
","Let me point out one thing for sure. Never follow mass hysteria. You hear a movie is good, bad, atrocity, abomination etc, just listen to it but don't let it cloud your senses. I can't actually say this movie is a mess or anything as the critics. I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. I mean this movie was very good. Well Martha was unfortunate (You know what I mean), but that movie shouldn't (neither should Suicide Stupid Squad) pull down this movie. This movie was thoroughly entertaining. Coming to a superhero movie nobody wants to see an effing Oscar movie. You want to see your favorite super heroes kick some ass! And this movie delivers it. You got a Wonder Woman scene, Amazonian fighting scene, JL's first fighting scene, Superman scene, And the final showdown. And these scenes are Amazing! I mean very very good!!! That amazon one was superb. You see them creatively trying to get the box away from Steppenwolf and that horse riding was all good. And the superman one, DuDe!!! It was so awesome. We all were like this is the effing Superman we were waiting for!!! His powers, his speed, his strength etc displayed in that scene quite shows why he is a bad ass. And that headbutt with Wonder Woman, so effing awesome!!!He could by himself alone defeat JL if it need be. When batman was like bring in the big guns, and I saw a lady leg, I was like don't do Martha because it would extend the parody, even if it was believable. Now I'm not forgetting aspects of movie as a whole, because 'critics' were complaining about the character development. What do you want more guys??? The movie was lacking some stuff, and that has been conveyed to the public by the makers, but the characters weren't so bland or very difficult to connect with. You get Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg and it is quite understandable you don't know much about them but this is not their standalone movie! Just wait for the standalone's. But that is not to say the movie isn't without flaws – Major one – Batman is a master detective, analyst you name anything he is that. And the first thing he do while facing an opponent is that he effing researches on them!!! And his plan was to wait for superman to frost his weapon(if he does come!) and wonder woman to break it, weaken him, hope he is very afraid and the bugs attack their leader. What!!!!???? I was stunned. He would have made a frost gun and other stuff and dealt with that. Separate the mother boxes, then what? What was he planning to do with the Steppenwolf? And on very deep thought, he did say it was a losing battle and there were not enough to face him, so maybe he was trying to defend humanity till JL's last breath, who knows. And the lack of more footage is quite noticeable, particularly in cut from a scene where Cyborg's dad is attacked, but it is forgivable. And the overall chemistry between cast was good, Flash's inexperience, Cyborg's question about himself and his powers, Aquaman's overall perspective on the other guys (that lasso scene), all shows their apprehensions as a newcomer to JL. If there is any flaw to change it for better, it would be to increase the movie time and fill the empty spaces and make the film complete. My Final Verdict – Awesome movie, Go check it out!!!"
"bwmwhitney","8","0","1","19 November 2017"," The rebirth of the DCEU
","*****CONTAINS SPOILERS*****<br/><br/>For DC fans who follow the comic books, you'll find Justice League to have much more in common with the ""Rebirth"" story arcs (2016-present) then you will the darker and more edgy ""New 52"" run (2011-2016). This change of tone is likely brought about by Joss Whedon's re-shoots, added humor, and lighter tone (gone is the muted colors and philosophical angst about the illusion of heroics). From the coloring to the dialogue to the score, the film is lighter and more enjoyable. Yes, Steppenwolf is obviously CGI and his motives are typical ""rule the world"" fare, but the movie isn't about him. It was about heroes finding each other and, most importantly, finding themselves. Steppenwolf was just the device to bring them together (they had to have some sort of insurmountable threat, right?). If you haven't guessed that Superman comes back in this film, then you haven't paid attention to the promotional images or the casting list. Superman does come back, and he's different. <br/><br/>I don't think that Zack Snyder would recognize the theatrical release as being anywhere near his original vision, I wouldn't doubt it if he feels a bit robbed (although I'm sure he is professional enough to not publicly criticize the film), but I think the film he had in mind would have just been a continuation of the heavy-handed approach of Batman v Superman. I could be wrong, but I think Whedon took Superman's return into an entirely different direction from what Snyder had intended. My guess is that, had Snyder finished the film, Superman's arc would have been much longer and more drawn out as he struggled with remembering who he was. That entire process was cut down to about five minutes...and it was probably a good choice on Whedon's (and perhaps Geoff Johns') part. We've all had enough of the dour, broody, internally-conflicted Superman. One reviewer wrote that this movie delivers a thankful Superman and a repentant Batman, and I think that is correct. <br/><br/>As for the other League members: Ben Affleck continues to grow in the role of Batman, and this film shows a more human and less one-dimensional Dark Knight. His scenes as Bruce Wayne were as important to the story as when he dons the cape and cowl. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman was once again a delight, particularly during the opening scenes, but she felt underwritten through much of the movie. Ray Fisher brought Cyborg to life and his performance has been unfairly ignored. He did a great job of portraying cyborg's internal conflicts of being split between man and machine. Ezra Miller's Flash was the comedic relief of the film, but he brought a timid humanity to the character that I think will give him room to grow in future films. Jason Momoa's Aquaman is the biggest shift from the source material, but his rocker, brawler, bad-ass, biker take did make an otherwise boring character much more interesting. Personally, I prefer Aquaman as the tormented King of Atlantis who feels compassion for the ""land dwellers"" while being simultaneously annoyed by them and occasionally wanting to flood the earth. That is beneath the surface (pun intended) for Momoa's character and, like the rest of the newcomers, it left a lot of room to play with for future solo and team films. The biggest question at this point is where do they go from here? I, for one, hope they continue down this lighter, more optimistic path of rebirth."

It was definitely good but certainly not a ground- breaking super-hero flick.<br/><br/>Batman is building a team comprising of Wonder Woman, The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman as the world is threatened by new enemy,Steppenwolf, who plans an attack on Earth by unraveling three mysterious Mother Boxes.Together, Justice League with new members must fight the evil to save the mankind. <br/><br/>It would have been really challenging for Zack Snyder, director of 300, Man Of Steel, Batman vs Superman, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a pretty good job and turned this comic-story into an enjoyable fun ride. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half boast of some path-breaking action sequences. The introduction of each superhero is astounding. 2nd half loses the steam with so many stories interwoven under the same umbrella. Couple of scenes that easily stands out - return of Superman, Flash getting a surprise of his life when he realizes that Superman is faster than him. Climax fighting is well executed. Screenplay is good along with punching dialogues. Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast. <br/><br/>Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline and lovely performances. It definitely misses the mark when you sky-high expectations but do you even care when you have the privileged to watch all the superheroes under the same umbrella. GOOD 3/5"

","In general terms, is a fine movie but the seriousness of DC previous movies are getting lost here. I don't like that a powerful character as Flash, able to move as fast that he can move between dimensions... here is just a stupid kid joking all around. In moments I felt watching a marvel movie.<br/><br/>But its worth watching and fun."

","Entertaining, but feels more like a better TV episode, than a cinematic experience. Still good for once in a while since it's so forgettable.<br/><br/>The forced in side-stories with Aquaman and Flash cross the same waters other DCEU movies did. Setting up other movies instead of telling this one.<br/><br/>Weirdest of all: If you take out Aquaman, it is still the same movie. He does nothing for the plot in any way.<br/><br/>You're getting better WB/DC but keep learning."
"cuatro33","Null","0","2","19 November 2017"," Entertaining, but easily forgettable.
","For all the superhero movie fans out there, this film could be re-titled as ""The Avengers League 1 and 2: Age of Steppenwolf"". It feels like they've compressed six hours of script in a two hours flick to pair with the current Marvel's movies. Due to this, there's no character development, and the whole movie runs in such a quick pace it's hard to understand what's going on, leaving a lot of plot holes.<br/><br/>Also, the inspiration on the current cinematic Marvel heroes is so obvious that it makes this film a bit insulting to the DC fans. Bruce Wayne tries to overpass Tony Stark's reasonable improvements —Veronica, suits, etc.— with bizarre gadgets just because ""he's rich"". The Flash is the average teeny buffoon as a copycat of the last Spiderman reboot. Cyborg just looks like the 2.0 version of Vision, and Aquaman... well, it's Aquaman.<br/><br/>The worst aspect of the movie is the ""downgrade"" of Wonder Woman. From the Goddess rable to destroy Ares to some kind of female squire who can't deal with a lame villain as Steppenwolf.<br/><br/>As a whole, this movie is entertaining, but it has so many flaws it doesn't get lower than 5/10 because acting is more than OK. I would like to see the uncut version of this film (if there's any) because I'm sure the released final cut doesn't make ""justice"" to the original script and cast performance."

","-- May Contain Spoiler --<br/><br/>To have all these superheroes in one place, you expected something unique. But, that wasn't the case. <br/><br/>Story line is boring. More talking, less action. Villain is there just to have a villain in the movie! Don't get your hopes up if you have not seen the movie yet."

","Believe it or not, it's taken years for DC Comics and Warner Bros to adapt a Justice League movie. With now the extended universe taking place with only 4 films established, it has finally happened and was it worth the long long wait? We say it was, but if you were expecting more of an epic piece of film that sticks close to the original material you may be left out or just wanting more.<br/><br/>With what it gets right, it's the chemistry between the heroes that form the league. With mixes of wit, epic solo moments and dialogue from the animated series (it kinda felt like it at times so nostalgia kicked in) they made like a likable team. The acting range from the cast were all great and there was no cheesy moments, in which speaking the tone of the film is certainly not dark or gloomy as BVS but it does try to convey a message of hope for the franchise (and possibly fix those mistakes that critics had signalled out). The scale of the action is great and the climax was decent, the CGI effects were great and didn't seem as bad as some critics have said to be and the humour was good. The bad though is basically that the story itself is thin with no major room for character development to expand further (though some small amounts were included), the villain is a 'muah ha ha' kind of baddie with little purpose but no backstory (though it as said in the film he serves for a much greater foe that will surface in a sequel). Overall, while it's certainly worth a ticket price to watch on the big screen we can't help but feel there could have been so much more if the studios haven't rushed it and let it build up from the solo films I'd they had stuck to that schedule. But then again, Zack Snyder had family issues and reshoots took place by Josh Weldon so you may see or wonder how the tone and running time were affected. Though it's fun, action packed and well acted, JL is a good movie but it's not something that is picture perfect (neither are the Marvel films at the moment) as it has its flaws, but now this should be the turning point for the DCEU to bring out more solo films and freedom of creativity and focus on the team up on a longer scale to make it a worthy build up. 2.5/5 stars.

"adlion94","6","0","4","18 November 2017"," Pretty Flawed, But I Still Liked It A Lot
","If this was a film of characters I had never heard of, it would blend into the 1,000 CGI fest crap action films that have preceded it. And I would've had zero interest in it.<br/><br/>But the iconic characters and amazing cast pulled me in. I have a crush on Gal Gadot in her WW outfit and Henry C is the embodiment of Superman. Affleck is a very solid Batman. And I loved Jason Momoa and his blue contact lenses and shoulder tats. Ezra added some spark.<br/><br/>The two other main characters of Cyborg and Alfred and simply too omniscient to be fun in the film. Alfred might as well be a wizard with his instant tactical knowledge, communications and countermeasures from 9,000 miles away. And Cyborg was more than just an emo Iron Man, his body appendages contained limitless Deus Ex Machina devices and knowledge. Want an arm-mounted interface for a billion year old space cube? Done.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I liked the characters. They are fun together. Unlike Avengers with so many stupid heroes (Black Widow, Captain America, Hawkeye, Winter Soldier) with no super powers other than Bourne Identity combat prowess), the Justice League is full of powerful meta humans. They rock. Watching WW and AM fight Steppenwolf was neato.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the damn cubes, the centerpiece of what drives the plot. Didn't a horrible transforming robot film from Michael Bay already do these omnipoent cubes as a plot device? And Marvel with the Infinity Stones? And Lord of the Rings with the Rings of Power? Ugh. It's lazy. Supremely lazy.<br/><br/>And yes, it's another ""destroy the world to create my new realm"" plot. Also very, very lazy. The villain in this film is supremely bad. Like Loki bad. He's a lame, fake looking joke. We just saw a villain 85% similar to him (with the same diabolical scheme) in Wonder Woman with Ares. Same godlike power, same horns on his helmet, same plan to make a red fiery world of war.<br/><br/>I found it weird how they brought Supes back, but whatever. He's a badass. He whomped Steppenwolf. But did Steps actually die? He kinda got sucked unto into the ""beam of light"" into the sky movie trope? <br/><br/>It sounded like I hated this movie, but I didn't. I liked the characters, but I hated the plot. Bad, bad writing. Why was it so complicated. Why so many moving parts. Didn't they learn anything from BvS, and how it creaked under the weight of it's nonsensical plot? I'm looking forward to an actually menacing villain in the next film. And I'm looking forward to seeing WW and Supes side by side with all their punch power."

","I've had an epiphany- Movie's have lost the art of storytelling- Daddy's home 2, Madea, Bad Mom's Christmas- the general population would rather be spoon fed slop from Hollywood studios than be moved by compelling stories. This was a cash cow with CGI-ridden scenes and a rushed story line,,, The acting sucked, the Jewish boy that played Flash was the best act in the movie. Good job little Jewish boy, everyone else sucked."
"ShaMana999","5","0","2","18 November 2017"," It makes sense...
","First a bit of backstory. I've see Man of Steel (Really Loved it), BvS (Hated it) and Wonder Woman (Loved it) and what i see from this movie is that there is a curious duplicity in this movie. Can't decide if it's serious of goofy. They had some good decent jokes which really didn't fit well. They were funny don't get me wrong but didn't fit the movie.<br/><br/>The plot was generic and extremely forgettable, you don't really care about it. There is no treat no excitement BUT in comparison to BvS IT MADE SENSE and that makes this movie a thousand times better than the previous (BvS)<br/><br/>The characters, loved the actors portraying them BUT the characters were not well written. Batman was a complete idiot. Having one liner quips and laughing around joking how rich he is constantly... there was no weight to his character, no motivation behind his actions. He didn't show even in the slightest why batman is such a badass in the comics regardless that he is just human. He wasn't scary nor imposing nor intimidating. At the very start there was some robber that started chatting him up like a normal dude. Aquaman was honestly a hillbilly. He felt outside what the character should be. Flash was fantastic, Wonder Woman extremely generic and Cyborg pretty decent as well but more than underdeveloped.<br/><br/>Superman however had a really great presence with the exception of his WHOLE FACE. It was really off putting.<br/><br/>In the end i want to like this movie but it's too inconsistent in its tone to be too likable."
"catalin-oroviceanu","6","0","2","18 November 2017"," Disappointing
","Where should I start? Ben Affleck is the worst choice for Batman. Maybe even worse than Clooney. I thought he was bad in BvS, but here he is even worse. Every Batman/Justice League movie with Affleck in it is an insult to the Batman character. Why? Because in the Justice League comics Batman is a leader, he's the smartest guy around, he's impressive, he's one of the central characters. Here, we could just do without him. Enough about Batman, though. The movie is too simple. A bad guy wants to destroy the Earth, good guys step in and, without even trying too much, they win. I don't want any elaborate plot, but still, this was way too simple. And then there's comedy. Or at least attempted comedy. Even Batman tries to make jokes (what the hell). Also Aquaman is at times a funny guy and Flash is a young idiot. This movie did not have: - a moment like those when you see the heroes preparing for the final battle and you wish you were there with them or you fell like shouting ""hell, yeah, go and kick their butts"" - a moment when you feel on the verge, not knowing whether the heroes will make it or not - a moment when the villain is finally defeated and you feel relieved, after you kept your breath throughout the whole battle. I saw each movie from the Nolan trilogy at least three times. Hell, I even saw Batman Forever 3 times. But BvS and this one? One time is enough. It hurts me to see what WB is doing with the DCU heroes. They deserve better. PS Where the hell is Green Lantern? He could be the funny guy"
"simoniung","6","0","1","18 November 2017"," Disappointing Delivery
","As a fan of DC over Marvel I can sadly say that DC have been blown out of the competition this year. The release of Thor: Ragnarok at the same time made DC's flaws more obvious.<br/><br/>Sloppy writing, cringe jokes and lines, and a shift between the atmosphere and the delivery of emotions.<br/><br/>With such a promising cast it's a shame that the movie turned out be a simple watchable movie, and that's me being kind.<br/><br/>Ezra Miller's jokes were funny at first impression but we're quickly overused. Every single time Zac and Joss had a chance to drop an unwanted one liner, they took the opportunity. Making viewers uncomfortable. <br/><br/>Inconsistencies between the power levels of certain characters were questionable as well. <br/><br/>I was really looking forward seeing some of these characters come to the big screen. I cannot recommend this movie."
"ahsawesa","6","0","1","18 November 2017"," It's Fine But Very Underwhelming
","Let me start this review off by saying I have been a fan of DCEU and MOS was enjoyable but objectively it was a 6/10<br/><br/>Then came BVS, which was enjoyable for me personally but if I look at it from a critic's perspective, I would say it's another 6/10<br/><br/>JL is like a third installment in Snyder's trilogy so with the last two films being ""OKAY"", this is the one that DCEU needed to be amazing, JL needed to WOW the fans, it needed to get people excited about DCEU but ultimately it doesn't do its job<br/><br/>Although it improves upon some things that were not as good in last films i.e characters being very likable <br/><br/>JL like all other Snyder films does have some really good action sequences<br/><br/>However this film has a lot of problems. <br/><br/>CGI and Cheap Looking Production<br/><br/>For a film that has this much budget, JL definitely looked like a Saturday Night Skit in a lot of scenes where the heroes were not in their costumes, where there were normal people<br/><br/>The CGI looks very off and weird in some parts<br/><br/>It's inexcusable to be honest<br/><br/>The film also has a lot of badly placed humor that kills the seriousness of the scene and a lot of the humor does try to APE the MCU's approach to humor. I like MCU although i would say they sometimes over-do their humor in some parts of their films. JL does something similar here and it feels forced<br/><br/>Another thing is tone, this is not really an issue but at the same time it kind of IS. <br/><br/>The light hearted tone is not the problem, the real problem is how forced it feels in some parts. Some characters have changed drastically and become so light hearted compared to how they were in last two films, it's jarring<br/><br/>The word jarring reminded me, The Editing is also jarring in this film<br/><br/>The villain Steppenwolf is very disposable, although has clear motives, barely feels like he presents any real threat<br/><br/>However what works for JL is that it's completely fun and enjoyable, it's a good time. But it doesn't feel like it has rewatching value. It's like a time pass ride that will entertain you.<br/><br/>The film also lacks substance. Unlike BVS and MOS, this film felt very barebones entertainment like Fast and Furious films and although Fast and Furious Franchise isn't BAD, they are definitely popcorn entertainment and so is Justice League<br/><br/>However JL does deliver a more coherent story than BVS and MOS, it doesn't try to do too much in one film although it does feel rushed because more than half of team members had to be introduced in ONE FILM and the run time of 2 hour doesn't help either. The film definitely could've benefit from a bit longer runtime like 2 hours and 20 minutes at least<br/><br/>JL also feels very self aware and pokes fun at itself in a way that seems like they're just going ""OH THE MASSES DIDN'T LIKE THE DARK TONE OF OUR LAST FEW FILMS? WELL WE WON'T IMPROVE STORYTELLING, WE WOULD JUST GIVE YOU JOKES, HERE YOU GO, HERE ARE YOUR ONE LINERS AND QUIPS"" and it also pokes fun at some serious things about its previous films which felt unnecessary <br/><br/>All in all, JL is fun time but it is no more than that. Although i enjoyed it less than BVS, If i speak objectively, JL is a better film than BVS and it is better executed but JL still lacks a lot in the plot and execution <br/><br/>Sadly it doesn't live up to the hype and doesn't do justice to the Justice League. The first live action JL film should've been amazing and instead we got another divisive OKAY film that amps up the entertainment factor for the mass audience but doesn't do much to be considered a really good film and that's why i said it's fine but JL should've been much more better<br/><br/>Although its a fun ride, i was underwhelmed<br/><br/>6/10"
"ramiz-wahab","6","0","1","18 November 2017"," Weak Villain. An Enjoyable film. (Might Contain Spoilers)
","This is an Average Superhero film with a few mind blowing scenes and a disappointing climax with a weak villain. The cast is good with their character dynamics. The villain Steppenwolf has a strong entry when he invades the amazon, but is defeated easily without a sweat in the end.Even CGI at few places looks shoddy which was a disappointment. This is a time-pass pop corn movie which does not match up to the Avengers but is still enjoyable if you are a fan of The League."
"nmik2005","6","0","1","18 November 2017"," Messy and fun.
","It's hard not have high hopes for a movie that is based on comic book characters with a lot of history. Each of us would probably have seen some adaptation of these characters in some media or another especially through comic books or animated series/movies. <br/><br/>This movie is sort of a rebirth for some of the characters to add some lightheartedness in a dark & bleak universe.The movie made me wanna see more of these characters in their own solo movies. The movie introduced these characters well but the impact could've been a lot better if they had their own solo movies beforehand. <br/><br/>Steppenwolf was a terrible villain who needn't have been a complete CGI character. The climactic battle involving the league and steppenwolf was underwhelming. It was still better than the fight against enchantress in Suicide Squad but that's still not good enough for the premier league of DC. A certain mustache removing CGI for a character was so distracting. <br/><br/>The usage of the soundtrack from the 1989 Batman movie and the Batman Animated series was such a class move. There were still so many good moments that provided a lot of fun throughout. This movie could've been a lot better but it is what it is now. There are issues in the movie, that if you don't nitpick on them you might actually enjoy it a lot. Don't skip it due to some Rotten tomatoes score."
"austin0731","4","0","2","18 November 2017"," Unfortunate, elementary narrative
","Justice League is quite a disappointment in spite of some triumphs that it does have. For starters, I did find Justice League to be worst than Batman V Superman, a great surprise to myself as I did not think it possible. But, this does make me appreciate Batman V Superman more than I did, I think a lot is to do with the tone as both films had pretty poor storytelling. <br/><br/>I recall that even though I did not enjoy BvS I really liked what they tried to do there, a darker more serious tone is what I feel the superhero genre needs. However, they couldn't capitalize with a good coherent story so that led to BvS' demise. In Justice League's case there is a strong attempt at comedy and a lighter story which really rubbed me the wrong way, I found The Flash's character slightly nearing annoyance several times and felt that both Aquaman and Wonderwoman were unfortunately slightly underutilized. <br/><br/>It seems that following the success of the much lighthearted Wonder woman along with Joss Whedon onboard the DCEU is going for such a fun high action movie. Yet, unfortunately it doesn't capture that Marvel spark and the characters just seem goofy, clunky and comical. The special effects did not help with this at all furthering this cartoonish texture that is seen in the characters in spite of some pretty solid acting across the board, which is unfortunate. <br/><br/>However, the worst part has to be the story, while it isn't in coherent like in Suicide Squad or BvS it was very weak, the villain Steppenwolf did not help this at all. It is just an over all very simple plot with a very dull, clichéd villain that resulted in a film that although had bits of fun action sprinkled through and certain feel-good moments had this overarching sense of simplicity. <br/><br/>I believe that the superhero genre must change in order to sustain as a film genre and in order to do this a brand like the DCEU has to adapt that dark tone that it had previously in order to distinguish itself from the plethora of superhero films we have today. Personally, comedy isn't the way and I particularly enjoyed the old worn out Bruce Wayne/Batman that we saw in BvS and I think that, that is the way for the DCEU to go."
"eftaylan","5","0","1","18 November 2017"," Hope come back for the DCEU !
","I think movie is so good but have bad things also, I didn't like Stepenwolf. Aquaman , Flash and Cyborg is good. I think this movie better then BvS but not good least Wonder Woman. This movie absolutely have a Villain problem. Batman is good but Bruce Wayne is not. Bruce Wayne not like Bruce Wayne his so cheery, Batman doing jokes in the all movie. My final opinion is this movie is good but it can be perfect also."
