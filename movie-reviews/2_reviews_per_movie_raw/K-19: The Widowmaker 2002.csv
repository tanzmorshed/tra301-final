","Based on a true story, K-19: The Widowmaker tells of the Soviet Union's attempt in 1961 to not fall behind the United States in the Cold War. The United States had just launched the Polaris-class nuclear submarines. K-19 was a Russian sub retrofitted for nuclear capabilities. The Soviet crew's assignment was to take the sub into the Arctic and test fire an Intercontinental missile. The Americans would monitor the test as a part of routine surveillance--the test was done relatively close to a NATO outpost for one, and it would notify them that the Soviets had equal capabilities to the American Navy, helping to either stave off war, sustain the Cold War, or both, depending on your interpretation.<br/><br/>As the film begins, K-19 Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is running his crew through a routine simulation. The nuclear reactor ends up having a problem, as it had on previous simulations. Polenin says they're not ready to run the mission yet. Instead of listening to him, the Soviet military powers that be install a new Captain--Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov is a hard-ass, which doesn't help him go over well with the K-19 crew, who were used to being chummy with Polenin. To make matters worse, Vostrikov has a questionable reputation--many believe that he's only in his position because of familial influence, and this despite the fact that his military father ended up in the gulag. After a number of bad portents, the sub is off on its mission and Vostrikov tries to get the crew into respectable and responsible shape so they can complete their task and get back home. As foreshadowed by the prologue, the K-19 eventually has a crisis with its nuclear reactor. The bulk of the film tells of this dilemma, attempted solutions, and various problems it causes.<br/><br/>K-19 is incredibly suspenseful and emotionally poignant. But it's perhaps amazing that it creates such nail-biting tension when we consider that on the surface level, it is simply a drama about a piece of machinery. Most of the plot is about trying to fix a broken gadget.<br/><br/>That might not sound very exciting, but there's much more to the film that a superficial glance at its plot would indicate. Director Kathryn Bigelow makes K-19 a combination of extended character portraits--primarily of Vostrikov, but also of a handful of other K-19 crewmembers, and a subtextual exploration of formal organizations and hierarchies in general.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is also a tribute to the real-life sacrifices and heroism of the K-19 submarine crew, who couldn't tell their stories for many years due to the Soviet government's official squelching of the incident. And on that end, the film is also a remarkable and perhaps somewhat controversial (politically and even artistically/philosophically) attempt to tell a serious, ""balanced"" historical story from a perspective ""within"" another culture.<br/><br/>Ford's performance is top-notch. He easily coaxes viewers to first hate him, even if they can understand his motivations, then he gradually layers complex nuances of character until we finally turn our opinions about Vostrikov around and empathize with him--but after not a little skepticism, which lingers for most of the central portion of the film--finally rooting for him against those government meanies who just can't understand his decisions because they weren't there. The whole arc easily takes film viewers on the same emotional journey the K-19 sub crew would have had.<br/><br/>Neeson has a similarly complex arc, but much more subtle--fitting for his supporting role. He goes from being your best buddy to someone to be suspicious of, then someone to be disliked for being a hard-ass of a different sort, then finally he surprises the audience with a saving grace action just about the same time that we realize that Ford as Vostrikov was right all along.<br/><br/>The film would be worth watching for just these two fine performances. But the crewmembers featured are just as sympathetic, especially when they make their mind-boggling sacrifices.<br/><br/>The progression of the matrix of dynamic personalities, their judgments, reservations, disputes, and suspicions, their pressing on despite less-than-perfect circumstances, and their relation to edicts from on high resemble what is probably more the norm for any complex, formal organization--not the least of which is the film-making enterprise, and more than likely, wherever you earn your daily keep.<br/><br/>Most of us have been involved with vocation-oriented projects or tasks that have had to progress despite the fact that a lot of people (involved or not) thought there were problems with the project or task at a fundamental level. This happens in films all the time. Studios and producers demand that a film begins production, maybe because it has to meet a particular release date, maybe because of marketing tie-ins and on and on, yet there still might not be a finished script, or we still don't know who is going to be cast as the villain, or any number of potentially disastrous situations. Vostrikov is like a film director being told to turn in a product on a tight deadline. He's doing the best he can to get the film rolling, and that means getting the crew to stop goofing off so they're ready to shoot, especially if the pressure becomes greater. It's probably a good thing that films don't run on nuclear reactors.<br/><br/>Of course the more literal political dilemmas that arise later on in the film are equally fascinating. But the humanizing elements of the characterizations and the universalizing elements on the story are what make K-19 hit home so hard. They add to the intriguing historical drama, the great direction and the good cinematography, score and other technical elements to easily push K-19 up to a 10."
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","34","39","10 May 2008"," It's frightening how close we came...
","K-19 has a massive cast, especially in the two lead characters of Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) and Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). My understanding is that Ford wanted to take on a role different than ones he had taken in the past to prevent type-casting, and while he does a good job in his role (as does just about everyone involved), the movie does slip up a little bit by having an almost nonexistent Russian presence in what is supposed to be the story of a Russian submarine.<br/><br/>Comparisons to the far superior Hunt for Red October are inevitable, and it is interesting to note that that movie was also about a Russian submarine but was presented all in English, but it doesn't lose credibility the way K-19 does, probably because it at least maintained a Russian accent, while Ford is speaking an unmistakable American accent and Neeson, well, Neeson is just Neeson and that's always good. He makes a great German but is less convincing as a Russian. I don't know why.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, as a story about an extremely important submarine mission rife with problems the movie succeeds brilliantly. K-19 is basically Russia's protection again nuclear war, which they fear the Americans might start at any moment. They hope to deter attack by showing evidence that they can issue destruction in return, and it is because of this that the sub is commissioned and sent on a mission to the polar ice caps to launch a test missile. There is a great scene where all of the crew and many other people are witnessing the launch of the submarine, and a woman swings a bottle of champagne on a rope to smash against the hull, but it bounces off unbroken. ""We're cursed,"" one of the dismayed crewmen says. That woman must have felt terrible.<br/><br/>There is an immediate rivalry between Polenin, who understands the ship's limitations and wants them corrected before beginning the mission, and Vostrikov, who also understands the ship's limitations but also understands how important the mission is and so outranks Polenin's protests. One of the best things about the movie is that the dramatic action is pushed along by genuine concerns. The movie would have suffered terribly if they were ignoring such important problems with the submarine without good reason.<br/><br/>One of the best things about the movie is that it is able to create so much dramatic tension, even though it takes place during peacetime. There was a huge amount of political tension in the air, but there wasn't a war going on. This is why there is not a lot of concern shown when an American destroyer is sighted near the submarine, because one of the goals of the mission is for the Americans to see what they're doing.<br/><br/>Instead, a small leak aboard the nuclear sub becomes a problem big enough to potentially start a war. Incidentally, one of the crewmen noticed something wrong with one of the dials at least twice before the leak was discovered (once before the ship left port). Had he reported that problem when he first noticed it, he could have saved the lives of everyone who died because of the radiation and prevented the entire thing. At any rate, once the leak is discovered, the options are to abandon ship and surrender the crucial technology to the Americans (a single concession which could dramatically alter the futures of the two nations, and thus rendering it unacceptable), try to repair the reactor without sufficient protection against the radiation, or scuttle the ship (also unacceptable because of the boat's importance).<br/><br/>There is a tense scene where Vostikov orders the ship to dive to almost crush depth, one of the obligatory scenes in submarine movies where the hull creaks and groans and everyone stares at the ceiling, like there's something to see there, and then he orders the ship to ascend at breakneck speed, surfacing through a layer of ice. Vostrikov intends to push the boat and the men to the limit so that they all know what the limit is, but unfortunately it culminates in a hugely disappointing display of digital effects as the ship breaks through the ice in something that looks more like it belongs in a cartoon than a serious film like this (I was reminded of the unfortunate Scrat's efforts to save an acorn from a splitting glacier in Ice Age).<br/><br/>The film requires an extra bit of suspension of disbelief to accept a story about a Russian submarine but without any Russian actors. I'm curious to know how it was received in Russia. I imagine it was a hit, despite the lack of Russian presence in the film, because it illustrates their courage and dedication to their country in the most difficult of times. But nonetheless, it is hugely effective and never lets up once it gets going. The ending strikes me as the part where the most creative liberties were taken with the original true story, leaving you with the feeling of a Hollywood ending imposed on a true story from Russian and American history. But if nothing else, the movie is a fascinating look at how close we came to widespread destruction during one of the most tense times in modern history."
"ccthemovieman-1","7","62","75","15 July 2006"," Memorable For The Radiation Scenes
","This was a pretty solid supposed true story of a Russian submarine and its captains during the early 1960s. It's memorable, story-wise, for the radiation victims among the crew members. There are some really dramatic scenes involving that horrific event. Otherwise, it's a story of the sub's problems and the conflict between two captains.<br/><br/>The story starts slowly so you have to stick with it as it gets better and better as it goes on and rewarding enough to make you glad you hung in there for the whole 137 minutes. <br/><br/>Profanity is minor and the Russian accents are handled well by the lead actors, led by Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson and Peter Sarsgaard.<br/><br/>It's not a great film, but it's good and interesting enough to recommend a rental, but not something I'd watch numerous times. Those radiation scenes would be a little too grim to watch numerous times."
"Oreolove","8","9","9","30 July 2002"," One of the Most Moving War Films I've Ever Seen
","Despite some bad reviews, being the war film fanatic that I am, I went to see this movie. I was expecting something much like U-571, (Men trapped in a disabled boat surrounded by the enemy), and this movie wasn't far from it. I must say that U-571 is my all-time favorite war picture, so I didn't expect The Widowmaker to surpass it. However, it came very close. The story was told well and the acting from most of the newcomers was superb. However, when I left the theater, I didn't want to watch it again for a long while. Not that it was a bad movie. It was just a little too graphic. I'm one who can watch people get blown to bits, decapitated, and crushed, however, since this story is true and the way these men suffered before they died a horrible death, was a little too much for me to watch. I know they couldn't have filmed it any other way. That is what makes this movie so good... the mere fact that I was uneasy while watching it. I found myself gasping... (I'm not one to gasp.)<br/><br/>The film is based on the story of a Russian sea captain (Harrison Ford) that is ordered to command a new nuclear powered submarine that has been thrown together in a very short amount of time. The objective is to test a missile near the north pole in hopes that the Russian government can catch up to the US who is threatening nuclear war. Although the crew is hesitant to board the ship, they fear the captain's wrath and work without complaint. Of course, the captain is 'do or die' and works the crew mercilessly, much to the dismay of the ship's original captain (Liam Neeson), who can do nothing but watch as his crew gets ready for mutiny. When the nuclear generator malfunctions, it is up to a few brave men to expose themselves to radiation and try and fix the power before disaster strikes and World War 3 begins. What I found most disturbing was the captain's refusal for American help until 7 men were dead and hundreds more were already exposed to dangerous levels of radiation. Watching these brave men slow-cook themselves for the rest of the crew was enough to make me cringe, (while other men dove into freezing water rather than go back into a radioactive submarine.)<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was a bit too much reality for me. However, it was wonderfully written, directed, and acted. I gave it ********/10."
"RavenZ","Null","62","78","12 October 2003"," Much better than I expected
","I rented this DVD for a little diversion, in spite of the bad buzz and the word ""flop"" attached.  I thought it was a very good movie, very suspenseful and interesting.  I don't nitpick about things like accents with films, just try to enjoy them.  I agree with the majority of posters here, it is well worth your time."
"Freddy_Levit","10","230","317","22 November 2002"," It is funny to see how most, if not all comments, except the American ones regarding K-19 really praised it and really enjoyed it. It must be half a century of propaganda, not Harrison Ford's accent.
","K-19 is a unique entry with a poignant portrayal of the other side of the Iron Curtain, showing the rest of the world the courage and the honour of the Russians to their mother land. Those who think of Russians, usually think of blood thirsty killing beasts who drink Vodka all day, but clearly this is just propaganda. I have Russian background and I have grown up around ethnics, and Russians are no different than the general public. It is American propaganda that has taken the rest of the world from understanding the Russian people. In K-19, the Russians are finally portrayed as human beings in the most harshest of all circumstances. This is not an action movie and it was not intended to be one. Most of the American comments shown here on Imdb are ridiculous. They clearly show the American expectations in a movie: It has to be a blow up, explosion filled, guns and bullets, kill your enemy blockbuster to make it into their best films ever list. K-19 however did not want to impress the Americans with special effects (it seems to the general American public that special effects are all that make quality movies these days) but instead wanted to show the world that Russian soldiers were not cold blooded murderers and were not war thirsty, but were soldiers under extreme circumstances - to show the struggle on the other side and to show the fear of death and the courage and heroics in preventing nuclear war, subsequently sparking World War III.<br/><br/>I was really impressed that at least some of the American comments were realistic, for anybody who understands cinema would classify this as a ""masterpiece"". I have come across many hilariously stupid and ridiculous American comments where they think they know what they are talking about and the thing is, they don't. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson pulled off a brilliant realistic performance. In my opinion, their accents were very well done (I am Russian, so I would know) and the direction was splendid (a benchmark in sub film history with its claustrophobic sense and close direction). I felt really sorry for the characters, especially for the Nuclear Reactor Officer. The Kirov Orchestra pulled off one of the greatest soundtracks that I have ever heard (really powerful and striking pieces) and the general Russian feel throughout the film was ""Authentic"".<br/><br/>I was truly struck by this film. It sent shivers down my spine. The settings, the story telling, the performances, the direction, the music, the tension, the interaction and chemistry between the characters, the authenticity and best of all the cast truly made this film a ""masterpiece"". Thank you to one great ""American"" film director (Kathryn Bigelow) for waking up and seeing the Russians in a different light.<br/><br/>This movies is certainly a 10/10."
"TOMASBBloodhound","7","29","35","14 October 2007"," Definitely worth a look.
","There is a scene early on in this film that pretty much sums up the risk that the crew of the new submarine of record will be taking. The officers are sitting around enjoying some vodka and one of them brings up the cosmonaut hero Yuri Gagarin. He offers the rumor that Gagarin was not in fact the first man sent into space. He was simply the first guy who made it back alive. And the crew of this brand new nuclear sub will face similar danger as their hastily prepared vessel will be pushed to the limit in order to impress both the politburo, and make the Americans take note of its existence. The boat has not even left the dock before it has claimed a handful of lives, most notably the ship's doctor who is hit by a truck just before departure. The top nuclear engineer on board is also hastily replaced when he is discovered drunk on duty. And of course, the champagne bottle doesn't break during the dedication ceremony on the first hit. This is a uniformly bad omen in anyone's navy! K-19 stars two wonderful actors in Harrison Ford, and Liam Neeson. Neeson plays the boat's original captain who strongly objects to how hastily the new vessel was thrown together. Ford, who has higher political connections is put in charge of the K-19 with Neeson being demoted to executive officer. Both men are stubborn, be generally respectful to one another. Trouble is, as the film later points out, a ship can only have ONE captain. One man that the crew looks to and respects. Two such men only create tension. Once the boat leaves port, things generally go pretty well. Despite a leak or two, the boat initially holds together. Ford orders a very deep descent, and of course we are treated to one of those scenes which every submarine movie has where the entire crew looks on nervously as the boat may or may not implode under pressure. Anyway, it holds up. The K-19 then breaks through a patch of ice and has a successful test firing of a missile. Everything looks like it is going great. The crew even stops to pose for a happy picture atop the ice after a game of soccer. Of course, things begin to fall apart from there on.<br/><br/>First off, the nuclear reactor pretty much goes kaput. Radiation levels rise rapidly, and for a while it looks like the whole sub might explode. Making things even more drastic is the presence of an American destroyer ship that would theoretically be taken out if the sub went nuclear. Tensions between the two nations were never really much higher than they were back then, so this may have been a real possibility. Once things start going badly, the tensions between Ford and Neeson begin to magnify. A mutiny is even attempted by those loyal to Neeson. Worst of all, the attempt to fix the reactor takes the lives of a handful of the crew in a particularly gruesome fashion. The film becomes more tense as things keep getting more and more dangerous for all involved. The conclusion is somewhat logical, but it might seem a little contrived. The entire movie is loosely based on real events, but the film has too many clichés for it to really be taken too seriously. Since there is no outright warfare going on here, the script has to pretty much recycle just about every tense moment from every other submarine movie not actually involving live combat.<br/><br/>The acting is good, but Harrison Ford is a bit tough to swallow as a Russian. His accent needs a little work, but other than that his performance was as good as he could have done for such a part. Neeson is terrific as usual. Peter Sarsgaard also shows great promise in this early effort of his. Hats off to director Kathryn Bigelow for using the claustrophobic environment of the submarine to her advantage. It must have been a difficult shoot, but she makes it work as well as you could hope. The film lost a small fortune at the box office for whatever reason. Maybe the absence of an American lead character was too much to overcome. Anyway, it is a shame that more people have yet to see this very good film. 7 of 10 stars.<br/><br/>The Hound."
"Agent10","8","157","215","22 July 2002"," Just proves critics know nothing about good film making
","Forget the critics, forget about the whiney Russian sailors: this film is worth watching. This just goes to show how idiotic the general viewing public has become. Critics have become nothing but a bunch of ""good review"" whores who work for commission and free gifts. It just goes to show idiotic they are, embracing schlock like Spider-man but putting down audacity like this film. For shame. With a good cast, excellent tension and Harrison Ford, they still want more action and silly exposition. <br/><br/>Maybe it is the subject matter, or maybe it's the fact Harrison Ford isn't killing anyone and trying to act sexy, but I cannot understand why anyone would put this film down. I don't think this film is detrimental to the reputations to the Russian sailors, who were portrayed with gusto and bravado not exhibited in most submarine films. Also, the claustrophobic nature of the film must have been difficult to film, considering the close quarters the characters had to work with. Overall, the film probably could have used some fine tuning, but the way it is, it is still quite a film to watch. 7.2/10"
"mattrochman","8","7","7","11 April 2010"," Surprisingly good
","I am one of those people who rolls their eyes at war and submarine films. For some reason, I find the claustrophobic atmosphere irritating and often bore of them in any case.<br/><br/>But this was gripping. Most of the drama actually takes place on the submarine rather than annoyingly cutting between onboard the submarine and the outside world the whole way through the film.<br/><br/>The acting was surprisingly good. In fact, exceptional, even though anyone could point flaws in the Russian accents. The drama was intense and overall, the film was gripping and easy to follow. The story unfolded, avoiding the temptation to overplay irrelevant aspects of the story. It's unfortunate that it was a box office bomb, but I think a great deal of that had to do with some unnecessary ""show off"" special effects, when the film ultimately hit its heights and greatness in the last 45 minutes, where a basic set and some good lighting is all that was needed.<br/><br/>If I had one complaint, it would be that the early stages could have been shortened because the film makers seemed hell-bent on trying to build a sense of intense camaraderie within the ship's crew, but somehow the dialogue and early events didn't quite do it correctly. Or perhaps it wasn't so necessary to harp on about so much. Nonetheless, it was a great watch and I was pleasantly surprised, even if you don't like movies of this genre."
"mozu","9","49","67","5 August 2003"," Intense
","This film reminded me more of ""Glory"" than of ""Hunt for Red October"" or ""Das Boot.""  The men sacrificed themselves not for The State or some ideology, but for each other, their fellow men & their leader.  You know, most of us can't change the world.  In a million years, whatever we do won't make a bit of difference anyway.  It's the small things--one person, one moment, one action--that really count.  That's what this story said to me.  Besides it's more exciting than all the shooting, car crashing, exploding movies out there."

Nevertheless, this is an excellent movie even without considering that stuff. I only made one mistake: chose it to watch on my computer in bed before going to sleep. Needless to say I couldn't fall asleep but in addition to that I got so into this movie that my heart started racing and I felt so bad that I didn't watch the last 30 minutes, I simply couldn't face the tragedy anymore. So I slept (could hardly fall asleep) and watched the remainder the next day (today), in the evening, and I so totally enjoyed it that can't help writing this review (I am not a big review- writer in general).<br/><br/>Anyway, I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone who loves exciting military dramas, or just enjoys watching good movies. ESPECIALLY with Harrison Ford and Niam Neeson - their acting was superb. Great movie!"
"Danimal-7","Null","18","24","16 August 2003"," Good story, but not history; it cheats to raise the stakes
","Spoilers ahead, mate!  Turn your course ninety degrees north or you'll run aground on Spoiler Island!<br/><br/>The opening says, `Inspired by actual events,' which basically means that there really was a Hotel-class sub called K-19 that had reactor trouble. That's about as close as the movie gets to the real events.  Everything else, even the names of the participants, has been changed to serve the story.<br/><br/>But it's a good story, with interesting people, conflict over important things, and jaw-hurting tension.  Captain Vostrikov and XO Polenin are excellently portrayed by Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson (and their accents aren't as bad as all that; aside from varying in intensity they were decent enough).  Vostrikov really is a bad and irresponsible commander; every criticism that Polenin levels at him is true.   That makes Polenin's actions in supporting him all the more interesting.  But Vostrikov does learn from Polenin's example.<br/><br/>The heart of the movie is the reactor near-meltdown, and the terrible consequences it has.  Military movies all too often portray courage as simply risking one's life to kill other people.  But what you see in this movie is REAL courage: I'd rather go into battle ten times than do what the reactor techs have to do in this movie.  Bigelow's portrayal of the chief reactor officer's breakdown is a touch of genius; it shows us what the people who did go into the reactor chamber felt, and overcame, and what the reactor officer himself overcomes later in the movie.  This movie should never have been marketed as a blockbuster; it works best as a simple and touching tale of heroism.<br/><br/>Regrettably, Bigelow felt she had to cheat to keep the audience's interest, specifically by selling us the preposterous story that the reactor meltdown could have caused a 1.4 megaton nuclear explosion.  This changes the story from one that merely didn't happen, into one that could not possibly have ever happened.  Nuclear reactors cannot cause nuclear explosions, because they don't use weapons-grade uranium.  Even if they did, it would require explosives, not just heat, to crush the uranium to a sufficiently supercritical density to detonate it.<br/><br/>Why did Bigelow resort to this?  Did she believe that a Western-world audience wouldn't care about the fate of mere Russkies, so that she needed to pretend that the fate of the whole world depended on K-19 to keep her viewers watching?  If so, she lacked confidence in the story she told.  I was, and am, a partisan of the West in the Cold War, and am glad that the West emerged victorious, but neither am I inclined to blame these Soviet Navy sailors for the evils of the tyrannical system that they were born into.  I would have enjoyed the movie every bit as much had Bigelow admitted that the sailors were fighting only for their own lives and the lives of their fellow crewmen.  And for those chauvinists who would see these sailors as less than human for being Russian, pretending that they saved the world doesn't help.<br/><br/>Rating: *** out of ****.<br/><br/>Recommendation: See it in the theater, and bring your suspension of disbelief along; it needs a workout."
"DarthBill","Null","45","69","27 April 2004"," Widowmaker
","In an attempt to break from his usual sympathetic every man bit, Ford plays a blunt, powerful, hard working Russian Naval officer who is given command of a nuclear powered sub from its well liked, almost fatherly captain played by Liam Neeson. Harrison and Liam clash as only two strong willed alpha males can when they take the sub out for a spin and fight to keep it from blowing up and causing a world wide tragedy.<br/><br/>Based on a true story.<br/><br/>Ford and Neeson give solid performances to this long, murky, cold, and ultimately detached action drama that proved to be one of 2002's lesser box office endeavors. As stated before, the film suffers from a feeling of disconnection, even as numbers of brave men are sent into the nuclear reactor with improper protection (""They might as well be wearing rain coats!"")<br/><br/>Could have been better, and it  could have been a lot worse. Rent and judge for yourself. Probably mostly for fans of Ford and Neeson."

","A wonderful movie to watch. Definitely the best I've seen this year. The fact that this movie is based on a true story, adds that much more emotion and drama to an otherwise simple story.

"imyjr","10","4","4","21 July 2002"," Easily Misunderstood Tragic Film
","It is very easy to be disappointed by this film if one enters the theatre expecting an action thriller based on true events which occurred during the cold war. This is not what this movie is about.... if that is what you are looking for, rent Hunt for Red October.<br/><br/>The cold war is at its height. To maintain their side of the power equation, the Soviets launch their first nuclear submarine..... an imperfect, untested, hastily put together submersible, seemingly ignorant of the potential for atomic disaster inherent in the simplistic layoutof the ship and its reactor, devoid of protective redundancies. In addition, the ship was woefully ill equipped: manuals were missing, radioactive protective gear was not provided,  the chief nuclear staffer fresh out of school with no experience whatever.  The Cold War logic which made the USSR send such an unprepared weapon to sea,(or for that matter which fueled America's own tragedy by making it send ""advisors"" to Vietnam around this time) provides the underpinnings upon which this tale is told and upon which decisions in its narrative are taken. It is a tale of heroism and camaraderie, loyalty and patriotism. Much is sacrificed in the service of an ideology we know was false and now know was destined to fail. The message, if there is one, is that ultimate virtues are not as important as what you do for your fellow-men in your immediate situation. Heroism is defined as risking one's life for the many, knowing full well that it could result in one's own death, fully aware of the life-plans one would be giving up. Perhaps it is doubly sad when such knowing heroes are young.  There are no easily discernible villains in this movie. One can, of course, blame the bureaucratic bigwigs who sent such an unfinished product to sea and at each danger signal refused to acknowledge obvious inadequacies and shortcomings. The Cold War objective was all-commanding. Cold War logic  required the Soviets to respond in kind to the perceived threat of American nuclear submarines.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, this is a very sad movie which in its own circumscribed way evokes the sadness and waste of that whole cold war period. The acting, the mis-en-scene, the music are superb. The interaction between all the characters is peerless. Kudos in particular to Messrs. Ford, Neeson, Camargo, Sasgaard, and Ginty. There seems to be a lot of relative newcomers in smaller roles.... all of them did well and created memorable characters in their brief parts. <br/><br/>I have found critics reluctant to praise this movie. I think they were disappointed for not seeing what they were expecting, a hang by the edge of your seat thriller, so they blame the director for not making the sort of movie they ""figured-out"" it was going to be. Such silliness. This is a movie that will be remembered."
"clarelouisecooper","10","6","7","28 April 2015"," A surprisingly different take on a cold war story.
","I cannot express how refreshing it was to see a submarine story told from a Russian perspective. I nearly didn't watch it as I expected the usual American take, which never depicts the Russians in a balanced Light.<br/><br/>The story is a good one and it's well presented by a decent script. The acting is strong. If I'm honest it was the draw of Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford that persuaded me to watch the film in the first place. These actors in the main roles give worthy performances and do at least attempt the difficult accent. Their characters are multi layered and both of them surprise the viewer by being more complex than we might at first expect. The same is true of the strong ensemble cast. Kathryn Bigolo's direction is excellent and the tension builds at just the right pace, adding to the already intense situation of the claustrophobic setting of the submarine. I even found myself holding my breath at times. I also loved the soundtrack, beautiful, atmospheric and haunting, it complemented the scenes it was used in perfectly. I thoroughly recommend this film. Disregard the moaning Minnie's with their lust for explosive action and give the more subtle action of this praiseworthy film a chance."

","This is not the kind of film I would watch again and again, but for entirely different reasons than some posts here : Simply it is too sad, too emotional. In fact, I made great effort to contain my tears during the commemoration at the cemetery.<br/><br/>This is a great film which deserves much higher rating than this one because not only it shatters the typical American-fabricated stereotyped image of Russians as always the villains, but also proves that Americans film makers as well can produce gripping and suspenseful films without needing to put in an excessive dose of violence as it is the standard practice. No vehicle or building blow ups, no endless rounds of firing, no f.. words. Instead, what we have here are a crew of young and innocent and above all patriotic Russian marines with no hesitation to risk their lives. In fact, so patriotic and prideful of their Russian identity they are that they refuse to accept help from Americans and show this by pulling down their pants to show their bottoms to the US chopper flying nearby the submarine in distress. Unlike their American counterparts who are always portrayed as foul-mouthed, over-confident and arrogant lads, the marines here do look like angels in uniforms.<br/><br/>Add the remarkable acting of two giants like Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson and you will be served a 140 minutes of epic and tragic events surrounding a first generation nuclear sub in the 1960s.<br/><br/>Overall, I entirely agree with the poster from Australia. The film gets all the stars from me. Last, a little question; and forgive me if it sounds too simplistic: I would like to know for sure whether radiation exposure can really cause such a horribly swollen arm and whether people can survive hours after such a long exposure near the core as they seemed to alive when taken aboard the rescue sub."

","Whereas Tom Clancy's ""The Hunt For Red October"" is my favorite fiction submarine movie, and ""Down Periscope"" is my favorite comedy submarine movie, ""K19 The Widowmaker"" is hands down my favorite true submarine story. Harrison Ford really shines as the hard as nails Captain of a nuclear sub which is ordered to sea before it is ready, just to prove Soviet parity in the nuclear race of the cold war. Liam Neeson is also quite credible in the part of the sub commander demoted to executive officer for not having the boat ready on time. And actor Joss Ackland again plays a Soviet High Ranking official who is more concerned about his own place in power than he is about the welfare of the crew of this sub. This is a visually constricting, riveting, tautly written, directed and performed film that you will be unable to forget once you have seen it. Especially touching is the scene in the cemetery, twenty-eight years later when the two captains and the entire surviving crew are reunited. This is a ten out of ten, and not to be missed."

The sacrifices that these men had to do is pretty riveting and some of the decisions made here are ones that a normal person could not even consider! Harrison Ford seems to be having a good time playing a different type of character for a change. And Liam Neeson is actually not to bad as the captain that Ford replaces.Watching the men volunteer to try and fix the leak while exposing themselves to radiation is pretty horrific stuff and its these scenes that make the film worth while."

","Finally a movie about a country saving the future of the world and it was not the United States. With what is happening in the world today this is easy to understand and no wonder this movie did not do well in the United States. A group of young Soviet Officers and Sailors charged with the task of the un-thinkable. K-19 is a film in Soviet times of strength,honour and commitment to the Motherland. A time of doing one's duty engulfed by the impending invisible death. Of Officers driven by the past into the hopes of the future. K-19 is a lesson to us all President Kennedy once said, "" Our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air We all cherish our children's future And we are all mortal."""

","I love Harrison Ford's movies, but I have never seen one that I would say is brilliant until now.  ""Air Force One"" was serious, but it was fun too. K-19 is different.  From the first scene, I knew this would be a serious movie.  The movie is based on actual events with, of course, dramatizations, for entertainment purposes. Liam Neeson is Captain Polenin, the Captain of a submarine.  He is loved by his men and in a moment of tenseness, he chooses the safety of his men over the State.  He is demoted to executive officer and a new captain takes over. Harrison Ford is the new Captain; Vostov.  The two men don't get on from the beginning.  Their styles are completely opposite.  After tense training drills, the crew begins to form around it's new Captain, except one. Because the ship was sent to sea without being ready, machinery all over the ship begin to break down, including the reactor.  Eight men die bringing the reactor back on line.  Of course, the movie ends with the ship being saved and returning to port.  But it really isn't a happy ending.  A total of 28 men die from radiation poisoning which could have been prevented if the commanding generals had taken the warnings by Vostov and Polenin seriously.<br/><br/>The most impressive part of this movie for me was the performances of Neeson and Ford.  Neeson has a reputation for fine preformances, but often Ford plays the fun action hero.  In this film, it is obvious that Mr. Ford can hold his own.  This film was well put together.  Directing and editing were on line with the movement of the story.  The music was outstanding.  But it was the performances of Ford and Neeson that made this movie. <br/><br/>
This movie was like a 7 course meal that, when it's over, you have to sit back and say, ""Now, that was satisfying.""  This was a very satisfying movie and I do recommend it."

The cook is always caught juggling plates of spilling food. The doctor repeatedly, comically, drops the same medicine again and again.I could go on.

"Charles-31","1","19","35","25 July 2002"," Nuclear weapons do not go off accidentally
","Okay, everyone, let's say it together and hopefully a cliché cold war plot line can be finally put to rest:<br/><br/>             Nuclear weapons do not go off accidentally!<br/><br/>             Nuclear weapons do not go off accidentally!<br/><br/>             Nuclear weapons do not go off accidentally!<br/><br/> During the cold war the Soviets lost 8 nuclear submarines, all armed with nuclear weapons.  They had fires, explosions, collisions and all sorts of accidents.  How many accidental nuclear explosions were there?  NONE!  The US lost submarines and crashed several bombers loaded with nuclear weapons. Once, an American nuclear missile exploded in its silo, blasting the hardened lid off the silo and sending the charred warhead crashing to the ground several hundred yards away.  There wasn't even a radiation leak.  The US actually put nuclear weapon prototypes on rocket sleds and in fires to ensure their safety.  I'm sure the Russians did the same.  Movies like K19 continue to rely on the myth that a fire or other accident might set off the nuclear weapons, thus triggering World War III.  In reality, K19 might have caused an environmental disaster, but it would not have destroyed a NATO ship and base due to the fire or the radiation.  Nuclear weapons are complex devices that require a specific set of actions to detonate them.  Were it possible to set one off by accident, it would have happened by now.<br/><br/>Before you see this movie, be sure to check out the comments of the actual crew of K19, who all condemn the movie as stupid, inaccurate, and insulting. As an example, they never called the K19 ""The Widowmaker"".  After all, the average crew member was 20 years old and for all who died only one widow was left behind.  Why make a ""historical"" film if it's all fiction?"

It also shows the courage and dignity these men had in the face of a failing vessel due to the ineptitude of the Soviet bureaucracy and the obsessive nature of its captain.  The men of K-19 rise to the cause and make the sacrifices necessary to attempt repairs.  Though they ultimately fail in the end they saved the world from an event that would have led to a nuclear war at a time when tensions between the US and the USSR were at their worse. This is a well acted film and well directed. I recommend it not only because it is a good story but places the Cold War in proper perspective as a folly of misperception."

But the script makes the most of all the cast as we relive the story of K-19 and how we learn of heroes that never were to be.<br/><br/>It's 1961 and a Soviet nuclear submarine, rushed off before it's sea-ready, is sent on a test-firing mission.<br/><br/>Two conflicts take front and center stage that make for this good movie. One is the clever use of 'good cop-bad cop,' as the former Captain (Neeson) is always at odds with the constant drill-testing from the newer Captain (Ford). Secondly is the suspenseful radiation leaking that takes over the submarine and its crew as the doctor is forced to tell everyone they're doing fine in one of the movies finer, yet terrifying, moments. The movie is longer than it could be, but not as long as some others of the same genre. If you enjoy a good drama tied to real events, K-19 would not disappoint."

I didn't expect much from this bland anti-red piece of cinema, but I at least expected it to be moderately entertaining. And it was about as visually stunning as a pancake. A burnt pancake.<br/><br/>There didn't really seem to be any attempt to create any characters that went any further than the surly, authoritarian Captain played by Harrison Ford and the charismatic other Captain (so-called) played by Liam Neeson. Naturally, the two occasionally clashed unspectacularly and this generally led to nothing in particular. Every single other 'character' in the film was merely a footnote. They seemed to be in the film merely because the film's leads needed other people to tell to do other things, like load torpedoes needlessly, over and over. <br/><br/>In essence, the film seemed to be just another way for an American filmmaker to put one more nail in the Cold War coffin. The message was simply this: the Russians are cold, incompetent and arrogant.

Trite, tedious and time-wasting, K19 is just another sad, shoddy example of dumbed-down American movie-making, one that in this instance is all the more odious for its arrogance in believing that the chronicle of this tragedy actually needed fictionalising.<br/><br/>And stunningly inept, too: whilst asserting that the incident remained a secret for many years, the script's many infelicities include a sequence where the submariners moon a nearby US destroyer and one crew member finally cracks and jumps into the sea to swim to the destroyer -- yeah, right, nobody on the US destroyer, nobody in Naval Intelligence, nobody anywhere at all in The Pentagon afterwards thought there was anything odd about it all.<br/><br/>But of course, nobody did. Because the Americans weren't there. And so the submariners didn't drop their pants for, uh, anyone.<br/><br/>What they did do, instead, was risk their lives -- and lose their lives -- grappling with a nightmare brought on by a Soviet system that was always a bigger threat to its own people than the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Though Bigelow's reputation very properly went down with this insensitive mess of a movie, the real sadness here (apart from the true story itself) resides in the demeaning of the medium itself, for film can, when it tries, be as fine a weapon in the service of truth as any book. One might have thought so august a body as National Geograpic would've known that, too, but apparently not: NG's involvement in the movie is enough to put anyone off being a future subscriber.<br/><br/>After K:19, what next? Perhaps the Kursk tragedy, with a back-story of how the Captain was struggling with the dilemma of coming out, and the boat's builders were in hock to the Russian mafiya and so skimped on the construction, and one of the crew smuggles a pet monkey on board with the ebola virus which will mutate under the influence of radioactivity from a damaged reactor and make its way via sub-sea currents to break as a toxic tsunami upon American shores.<br/><br/>All fiction, of course, but who cares?

As a former submariner myself, I truly appreciate the way this movie tried to show the tensions that can arise hundreds of metres below sea level. This wasnt an isolated incident with Russian submarines (Kursk, 2000) the 10/10 from me is for the depiction of submariners, their struggles and their sacrifices which are not known to the public due to scarce media atrention on this subject. Most people will never get to enter a submarine in their lives. For me the most powerful line in this movie is when a sailor says ""Serving the Soviet Union, Comrade Captain"" in the face of almost certain death. Its the purest expression of patriotism and self sacrifice I have ever seen in a movie. My thanks to Kathryn Bigelow for putting this together and showing the average person what a submariner goes through during combat.

However, both pulled off good performances here, in a movie that seemed to offer a realistic portrayal of life on a Soviet sub in the midst of the Cold War (1961 to be precise.) Purportedly based on a real incident that came to light only after the fall of communism in Russia, the movie combines the rivalry between the two captains with the story of a nuclear reactor out of control and about to explode (and also manages to include an interesting look at Soviet perceptions of the United States - a perspective often lacking from most American movies.)<br/><br/>Perhaps the sheer realism of sub life accounts for what I thought was a general lack of tension for the first 90-100 minutes or so. It must be sheer drudgery for sub crews to go through drill after drill after drill; it's even worse to have to watch them going through drill after drill after drill. At times, the story actually became quite tedious. However, the drama in the last 30 or 40 minutes definitely helped make up for that, and surely - the tedium notwithstanding - the sheer realism of the movie earns it some points.<br/><br/>This is a good movie. Not the best ever made, certainly, and not even the best submarine movie I've ever seen (I'd rank ""U-571"" and ""Run Silent Run Deep"" ahead of it) but still it was worth watching.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd rank it as a 7/10."

With their own lives at stake they worked to repair the cooling system for the reactor core. <br/><br/>I actually thought that an American movie showing a Russian tragedy would be a very bad idea. In K-19 the director, Kathryn Bigelow, actually managed to show the chain of events without making the Russians look like fools and morons and vodka-drinking idiots. Good work, Kathryn! I think a good reason for the accuracy is probably the the National Geographics society was involved in the making of the film.

I admit, I've got two of her movies on DVD and I like her style, so it was very interesting to watch this film of her's that tanked that summer.

Problem solved. Next. But so many people and critics couldn't get past them. How did Errol Flynn survive, then? And what about Kevin Costner at that? One critic called Ford and Neeson exchanging ""Boris and Natasha accents."" Peter Saarsgard was interesting and really committed himself to the part, as the clichéd doomed young virginal officer. Liam Neeson was okay (although I think he's a bit overrated in life). All in all, this wasn't a bad film, but it wasn't that good, either. I was curious before I saw the film on how they were going to actually make a good, taut movie about a nuclear meltdown. Well, they didn't make a taut, good movie out of it. They couldn't.

And even the title weirded me out: sounds like a personal lubricant or a porno!<br/><br/>The production design was good (although I read earlier on this site that there weren't any handcuffs in the Soviet Union until much later after 1961). The submarine's interior and instruments were so primitive compared to our technology (which was typical- they were always a decade behind us back in the Cold War), it looked like they borrowed the set from ""Das Boot"". And being that my father was an Army Intelligence officer of Soviet equipment in the 80s, I found their practice of only having aspirin aboard for their only first aid realistic (not to mention how they did not possess radiation suits either). The Soviet armed forces then did not believe in human weakness, nor could it stomach it. So it was very commonplace and practiced not to provide ulterior equipment aside from firepower.<br/><br/>After all the submarine flicks that have come out in the past fifteen years, from ""Red October"" to ""Crimson Tide"", I think that I've grown out of my interest in watching them after seeing K-19."

The supporting cast also adds to the movie as well. I felt like I was there with them on the boat and felt the same pressure they were under.

I am reminded of the movie The Enemy Below where the basic humanity of the Germans is also shown in stark contrast to the propaganda view normally portrayed during the Second World War. Make no mistake; in the case of both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union we are dealing with what can only be described as criminal states. But at the same time, individuals must be viewed for their own deeds and not those of their leadership. Also, many men believed they were doing their patriotic duty even though they did not subscribe to the official policies of their government. One need only look to the examples of Rommel or Zhukov. <br/><br/>We all owe a lasting debt to the military forces of the former Soviet Union: it was they who defeated Nazi Germany.

","You have to wonder what Harrison Ford had on his mind when he decided to produce and star in the new Cold War submarine saga ""K-19: The Widowmaker."" Clearly, this catastrophic but conventional expose about a true-life incident in 1961, suppressed by the Kremlin until 1989, boasts everything anybody could hope for in a gripping disaster epic. During their historic maiden voyage on the first Soviet nuclear sub, the skipper and crew struggle desperately to repair the cooling system in its reactor after it repeatedly breaks down. Happily, the Soviet skipper and crew of K-19 solved this crisis before a cataclysmic thermonuclear blast could have vaporized them and triggered World War III. Not since Lewis Milestone's ""The North Star"" (1943) or Jacques Tourneur's ""Days of Glory"" (1944) has Hollywood celebrated the Communist exploits of the Soviet Union in such a heightened heroic fashion. The zombies of Joseph McCarthy, J. Edgar Hoover, and anyone who championed the House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950s would rise from the dead and lynch the treasonous liberal revisionists who financed this better Red than dead yarn. Indeed, while this competently crafted, historically accurate, white-knuckled, undersea thriller won't win any Oscars, the filmmakers reveal a facet of the Cold War that few knew. <br/><br/>Cross the Gene Hackman & Denzel Washington submarine nail-biter ""Crimson Tide"" (1995) with the Jack Lemmon & Jane Fonda nuclear meltdown melodrama ""The China Syndrome"" (1979), and you have a pretty good idea what to expect from Christopher Kyle's testosterone-fueled screenplay. ""K-19"" opens as the Soviets commission their first atomic sub, so they can show the Kennedy administration that they can launch nuclear missiles at sea, too. Before the Russians take K-19 to sea, several construction workers die during freak accidents. Worse, the Kremlin replaces the commander, Capt. Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson of ""Star Wars: Episode One""), with legendary Capt. Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford of ""Air Force One""), and this last minute change of command enrages an already superstitious crew. Meanwhile, Vostrikov ignores bad omens galore, like the champagne bottle bouncing off the hull rather than shattering at the christening, and sets out to chart history. Not long after they dive beneath the waves, Vostrikov learns K-19 is far from being ship-shape. Nevertheless, like the Hackman skipper in ""Crimson Tide,"" Vostrikov runs his crew ragged with drills to sharpen their response time to emergencies. Suddenly, the worse thing that can happen occurs--the nuclear reactor overheats. Valiantly, the crew manages to cool the reactor. Not long afterward, however, the reactor blows another gasket, and the submariners stage a mutiny as a U.S. Navy destroyer lurks on the horizon.<br/><br/>Director Kathryn Bigelow, whose credits include ""Near Dark"" (1987) and ""Strange Days"" (1995), adroitly piles one suspenseful situation atop another. Sixty-year old Harrison Ford makes a convincing but sympathetic Russian naval officer who refuses to scuttle the flagship of the Soviet fleet. Miraculously, despite its noble depiction of our former adversaries, ""K -19: The Widowmaker"" manages to keep you on the edge of your seat for most of its lengthy 138 minutes."
"ahembree-1","8","3","5","26 February 2006"," Go to comments
","K-19: The Widowmaker is a very interesting movie. Based on actual events in 1961, this film shows actually how close the world came to a full fledged nuclear war between the super powers. When the Soviet Union's very first nuclear submarine malfunctions, it is only hours until it creates a nuclear disaster two times the size of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. The fast paced plot keeps the viewer entranced in this roller coaster ride of a film. Casting quality actors such as Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson was not a problem, it was the quality of acting they put forth with poor accents. Action was plentiful with many twists and turns that Director and Producer Kathryn Bigelow uses throughout the film.<br/><br/>K-19: The Widowmaker starts very quickly with a training drill that goes wrong because of a burnout in the ignition sequence. The reason for the electrical problem is the Soviet Union's budget cuts which then lead to corner cutting. The Soviet Union is more concerned with organizing party VIP tours while K-19 is stuck with incompetent yard crews and defective parts. This foreshadows the many problems that the submarine and crew will face throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>Series of problems and bad luck continue throughout the movie beginning with the electrical failure. Then at the christening of the submarine, the champagne bottle did not break against the boat. Every sailor in the world knows that this is a very bad sign. Next, the ship doctor realizes he received the wrong drugs. Dr. Gavril hurries off the off the ship in an attempt to flag down the medicine truck and becomes road kill. Five die from fumes sealing the tanks, four in construction, and a partridge in a pear tree. With ten crew members dead before leaving the dock, the crew nicknames the boat ""The Widowmaker"", no argument here. The sequences of drama at the beginning of the movie keeps the viewer interested early on and throughout.<br/><br/>As for the quality of acting, the one thing that really stood out was poor accents. In one particular scene, Harrison Ford's character Comrade Captain Alexei Vostrikov gave a speech to his crew. He began to tell them that Moscow was pleased with their test missile firing and that they have been rewarded with a new mission. Harrison Ford's accent fluctuates between American and Russian throughout the speech. At most times during the film I thought that Indiana Jones was the captain of a nuclear submarine. On the other hand, Liam Neeson does a very good job portraying Executive Officer Comrade Captain Mikhail Polenin opposite Harrison Ford.<br/><br/>As for the Action, it was quite frequent throughout the movie. From Comrade Captain Vostrikov's constant submarine drills to prepare the crew in case of a nuclear disaster. He does this keep them ready and on their toes. Second, Comrade Captain Vostrikov takes the boat below crush depth, surfacing the submarine through about a meter of ice in the North Atlantic to fire a test nuclear missile. The crew also has to take measurements to contain radiation leakage from the reactor core and dealing with the problem of radiation poisoning.<br/><br/>Louis Nowra writes a winner of a story and Christopher Kyle does a very good job on the screenplay. K-19: The Widowmaker suffers from a feeling of disconnection being so far from the motherland, even as numbers of brave men are sent into the nuclear reactor with cheap chemical suits because the Soviet Union did not want to spend the money on radiation suits. This film could have been better, and it could have been a lot worse. In conclusion, if you do not nitpick about accents in films, K-19: The Widowmaker is well worth your time."

","This is a true story and as a US Navy Submarine Veteran I may have a somewhat unique perspective on the realism aspect of this movie.It is my opinion that this is the most realistic of all the submarine movies ever made, and I have seen all of them. I believe Das Boot comes in a close second in realism, but that movie's subject submarine comes originates from a very different era. Other viewer comments more than adequately cover other aspects I believe.<br/><br/>The realism, honesty of emotion, and actor integrity (Harrison Ford is nothing less than inspired in his role as Captain Alexei Vostrikov) all combine to give the viewer a real taste of what can happen on a nuclear submarine. I am not Russian and never served aboard a Russian submarine, but believe me we are all brothers under the water. We didn't have political commissars, but current politics was always of keen interest to those of us who held the keys to the fate of the entire world. We monitored international events 24 hours a day. <br/><br/>By way of comment, I spent 8 years on Fleet Ballistic Missle submarines as an officer, including service on the Gold Crew aboard the George Washington, America's first Fleet Ballistic Missle submarine. I hold the Navy Cross among other awards and commendations.<br/><br/>Good viewing."

Nowadays with one Russian submarine launched missile you can destroy half a world.. and everyone's got to have them and more is being built as I speak..

","Before purchasing this DVD, I checked with IMDB and discovered that people 45 and above were the only ones to give this movie more than an okay rating. That's all right.  I'm over 45, have a military background and am very familiar with the history of the Soviet Union's first nuclear sub.<br/><br/>With that said, I must tell you that this film is really very good.  Not being of the generation that needs Cerebellum based FX electrodes to enjoy a film, I emersed myself into a true reality flick.<br/><br/>One of the most common and childish criticism of K-19 seems to be that Harrison Ford had a lousy Russian accent.  Well, have your high school teacher give you an ""A"" for linquistic analysis and go to the head of the class.  But it's really irrelevant.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent, particularly for the well casted and numerous second string crew.  (SPOILER?) Sorry boys and girls.  There wasn't a nuclear explosion to blow up polar bears, melt the ice flows and drown New Jersey.  But a graphic visual of a ""China Syndrome"" isn't really what makes this movie taught and filled with emotional depth.  Reality doesn't work that way and this movie was very true to life.<br/><br/>It's sad that so few people have a military background anymore. They would have appreciated the impact of military people working together to battle the chill of catastrophy's creeping hand.  The sense of patriotic duty (opps, did I use a term that's on the politically correct banned word list) combined with self sacrifice was very real.  Barring some theatrical reshaping of history, the story was true to what actually happened.<br/><br/>Like other movies that are coming out now, the viewer is expected to have some level of historical literacy to fully appreciate the drama.  That so many lack this knowledge doesn't say much for our educational system.<br/><br/>K-19 The Widowmaker is a first class historical drama played out during the most dangerous of cold war years.  It's action packed for the historically literate, giving a good taste of the military ideal and the meaning of honor.  I give it a 7.1 out of 10."

","A real-life historical incident becomes the basis for this military thriller from director Kathryn Bigelow that's reminiscent of such submarine dramas as Das Boot, The Hunt for Red October, Crimson Tide, and U-571 in this film,K-19: The Widowmaker.It stars Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson together with Peter Sarsgaard,,Joss Ackland and John Shrapnel. The screenplay was adapted by Christopher Kyle, based on a story written by Louis Nowra.<br/><br/>Captain Alexi Vostrikov is a Russian naval officer who's being given command of the Soviet Union's first nuclear submarine, K-19, at the height of the Cold War in 1961. The vessel's previous commander, Captain Mikhail Polenin has been demoted to executive officer following a botched test and his outspoken assertions that the flagship is not yet ready for deployment, but he curbs his resentment and resolves to serve his new superior well. The former commander has concerns that are well founded: parts are not yet installed, equipment is missing, and the ship's doctor is killed in an auto mishap. Political pressure forces Vostrikov to sail his crew into the North Atlantic anyway, for a missile fire test that serves as a warning to the U.S. that its enemy is now its technological equal. The test is a success, but a disastrous leak in the K-19's reactor cooling system soon threatens to create enough heat to detonate the craft's nuclear payload wherein would certainly be mistaken for the first salvo in a worldwide atomic exchange and spark the beginning of World War III. With no other option, Vostrikov orders his men to repair the damage in ten-minute shifts, irradiating them hopelessly. The conflict between the seemingly bureaucratic Communist Vostrikov and the more humane Polenin escalates, until a surprising twist reveals where both officers' loyalties truly lie.<br/><br/>This is a gripping drama even though the filmmakers have taken liberties with the real facts.Also,it can be considered a brutally effective and brilliantly constructed dramatic thriller wherein intense wartime submarine movie celebrates heroism.This is also a taut, skillfully- executed film anchored by two rock-solid leading men in Ford and Neeson as well as talented director in Bigelow.Overall,it makes the audience care for Soviets who are trapped between a rock and a hard place deep beneath the sea."
"extravaluejotter","6","2","3","20 December 2006"," Historically Flawed But Worth Watching
","""K-19, The Widowmaker"" is only loosely based on real events. National Geographic produced this movie and the real story of the K-19 can be found on their website. Nonetheless, the film is worth watching for its gripping storyline, realistic set design and the scenery-chewing performances from Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford.<br/><br/>Ford in particular stands out in a rare ""Not-So-Good Guy"" role. He is backed up by an excellent cast with quite a few well-known British actors in supporting roles.<br/><br/>The submarine itself is a triumph of production design. I've been lucky enough to see the inside of a 60's-era Soviet sub and the team who worked on ""K-19"" did a great job constructing the sets. Director Kathryn Bigelow and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth managed to avoid the feeling that the sub set was built for filming with a combination of hand-held camera work and rigidly confined points of view.<br/><br/>Despite a reasonably pacey screenplay and a lot of drama, there are a few clunky elements in ""K-19"". Some of the crew may as well have ""Corpse"" tattooed on their foreheads as it's clear very early on that they are doomed. The reactor control officer is the only main character we see kissing his girlfriend goodbye, and he is the only crewmember who shows anyone a photo of his sweetheart. Not a good sign. Despite wimping out of the initial attempts to prevent a reactor meltdown (having seen the burned, vomiting wrecks who emerge from the reactor compartment after just 10 minutes), Lt Radtchinko enters an irradiated compartment to bodge a leaky coolant pipe and single-handedly saves the ship later on, just like I knew he would. One of the aft torpedo room ratings exhibits signs of claustrophobia fairly early on and, after a fuel leakage in his compartment, I found myself waiting for the poor guy to crack under pressure. He does of course, spectacularly, taking a few of his crewmates with him. Having dissed the film for these predictable turns, I have to say that I didn't predict the course of events after some of the officers mutinied against the captain, so maybe I'm criticising too much.<br/><br/>What makes this film so believable is the recreation of Soviet Russia's Cold War mentality. Everyone is under pressure to conform to the Communist ideal and the submarine is a hastily-designed jury-rigged deathtrap. Although the film doesn't mirror the true story of the K-19, it does show the courage and humanity of a submarine crew who went to sea in a boat that they knew was fundamentally unsafe. I actually found myself breathing a sigh of relief when the majority of the men aboard this floating radiation hazard were rescued."

","This movie wasn't ever going to be a ""major motion picture"" event. It had an old storyline and the plot developments were about as predictable as you can get. If you are going to do a story that people know the outcome to, you had best make that story only incidental to the ""real"" plot. Titanic did this, making the sinking of the ship secondary to the love story/triangle between DiCaprio, Winslett and Zane.<br/><br/>There was some attempt to do this with the character development between Ford and Neeson, but it was all so predictable that it never really worked to push the sub disaster into the background. Also, I was never really convinced by the way Ford ended up the hero. SPOILERS AHEAD. He'd commanded the sub like an idiot beforehand and the friction between him and Neeson built nicely until.....mutiny! Neeson staunchest supporter and the boat's political officer wrest control from the maniacal Ford and what does Neeson do? He frees Ford and imprisons his buddy and the political officer? To me that didn't come across as a loyal officer supporting his superior and the chain of command (as it seemed intended to) Instead it came across as Neeson's character realising the s*** was on the fan and not wanting to take control of the situation. In short, showing his loyalty by keeping Ford in charge to take all the crap that was sure to come of the situation.<br/><br/>To summarize then, this film has:<br/><br/>The obligatory sub disaster. The crazed captain who redeems himself. The coward who redeems himself by saving the boat. The heroic crew who are loyal to the Motherland. etc. etc.<br/><br/>Despite all this, the movie is entertaining enough, but not really one that you'll watch again and again. Although, I would like to know what happened to the crewman who jumped overboard from the sub and made a swim for the American destroyer. Did he make it? Did he drown? Did he become an American citizen? Was he handed back to the Russians?<br/><br/>Oh well."

I came out of the theater feeling like I'd actually seen one of the first above-average movies of the year.<br/><br/>In this movie, Harrison Ford plays a 1960s Soviet sub captain who is brought in to command the Soviet navy's new nuclear submarine after the original captain (Liam Neeson) is removed from the position for political reasons. Neeson stays on the ship as second in command, and Ford is forced to contend with the crew's loyalty to Neeson. Problems plague the submarine before it even leaves drydock, leading the men to begin calling it ""The Widowmaker.""<br/><br/>This movie isn't told from an American point of view, and doesn't restrict itself to American ideals. The drama is played out without being biased by Hollywood notions of hero vs. villain or a formulaic plot. It really seems like this movie was true to the historic event it was based on.<br/><br/>The characters were portrayed well by everyone in the cast, including Harrison Ford, who plays against type. Ford turns out a really good performance as the domineering captain and manages to escape his celebrity and really descend into the character. I actually forgot I was watching a Harrison Ford movie. Liam Neeson is solid as well, and the crewmembers without exception turn out convincing performances.<br/><br/>Director Kathryn Bigelow delivers a strong and well done movie with ""K-19: The Widowmaker"".

","Saw this movie and found that the critics were, for the most part, wrong about it.  I'd give the movie four stars on my five star scale. (Note: on my scale very few movies get all five.  Casablanca gets the ""Pershing"" rating, six out of a possible five.) THERE ARE SOME ""SPOILERS"" IN HERE Both Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford did superb acting jobs in this movie, and aptly portrayed the kind of tension that very often happens on ships of all navies between the captain and the XO.  Not at all unusual for the crew to side with the XO, as that's part of his job, to maintain morale by being a sympathetic ear for the crew. Cinematography was excellent throughout, with nice camera work in the cramped quarters of the sub.  One got that feeling of being isolated from the world, especially after the ""accident"" that killed some of the crew. Music was nicely attuned to the mood of the story, and played well by the Kirov Orchestra, even if the American Federation of Musicians objects to use of a ""scab"" orchestra.  Them Russkies can PLAY! The story may not be totally accurate, but was told in a manner that kept my attention even though I knew ahead of time what was going to happen. This movie could have gotten four and a half stars from me, or maybe even five, if not for one flaw that the writers should have avoided. It's always one of Hollywood's pre-conceived and STUPID notions.  That's the notion that a reactor problem (a biggie!) could cause the missiles on board to explode into megatons of thermonuclear violence.  That is something Hollywood has never understood and won't ever understand, that it takes a whole series of procedures to be executed ON PURPOSE just to arm those warheads.  Even a complete meltdown of the ship's reactor could not ""set off"" the warheads, which would have sunk harmlessly into the abyss along with the rest of the boat. Would have been nice if they'd ASKED a nuclear physicist or two about that, but probably they'd have ignored any such advice anyway, so as to keep the ""tension"" in the story line.  For me, the strong potential of an agonizing end by radiation poisoning for all aboard would have been fine by itself. No violence, except for the depiction of a couple of accidents, and those were understated in the film.  Even the radiation burns were not exaggerated.  Just enough special makeup to give you the idea that it's not a pleasant way to go. There is only one brief sequence that involves what I call ""the girl"" in this movie, and that's a goodbye scene out in the open just before the ship sails.  Nicely done and not bothersome.  (No nude bodies writhing between the sheets.) That matters to the story later, in that one of this young couple winds up paying the ultimate price to save his shipmates, thus never getting back to his young and very pretty wife. Worth the price of admission in any case.  Some Americans may be offended by the story being told from the Russians' point of view, but after all that's what military services are all about.  Try watching the classic ""The Enemy Below"" or ""Das Boot"" to put that aspect in perspective."

","I generally love submarine movies, and went into this one with high hopes, and I guess overall it wasn't bad, but there were some things that annoyed me enough to ruin it for me.<br/><br/>Could Liam Neeson have been any whinier, wimpier, or more insubordinate? Harrison Ford should have locked him in his quarters the very first time he questioned his orders in front of the other sailors, and kept him there for the rest of the mission.  Instead, he continues to let him undermine his authority for the rest of the movie, and we're supposed to believe that he has redeemed himself by releasing the Captain at the end and arresting the planners of the mutany.  Wasn't it obvious that Neeson had encouraged mutiny in the first place by constantly second-guessing all of the captain's orders?<br/><br/>Hahaha, I was very happy about the casting of Ambassador Andrei from the Hunt for Red October as the Soviet Marshal.  When his men report to him that the sub is out of radio contact at the end, I can just hear the National Security Advisor saying, ""Andrei, you've lost another sub?""<br/><br/>-BT."

"Kirasjeri","9","2","3","19 July 2002"," SUPERB STUDY IN COMMAND - Not Just another ""Submarine Movie"".
","Any reviewer who sees this fine film - and great character study - as merely ""another submarine movie"" is braindead. The location happens to be on a submarine, but ""K-19"" is in fact a marvelous study of the problems of command, its responsibilities, and the ongoing struggle between the new captain's methods and those of the former captain whom he replaced. It is their battle of styles and personalities that makes this movie a great success.<br/><br/>This film depicts (and dramatizes) an historic event, for decades kept secret until the end of the Soviet Union. So I don't believe there are SPOILERS BELOW, but there might be.<br/><br/>The date is 1961 - the height of the Cold War - and the Soviet Union has launched its first nuclear-powered submarine complete with an unarmed ICBM. The purpose is to show the Americans the Soviet's nuclear capability by launching the test missile from the Arctic ice cap, thus making a first strike on ""The Motherland"" less likely. It is another step in the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction.<br/><br/>Captain Polenin (Liam Neeson) of this new K-19 submarine is pushed down a notch in the chain of command when an electric circuit fails during a test firing and he is rather arrogant with the resident admiral observing. Polenin becomes Executive Officer and Captain Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) is appointed to command the boat - a vessel already plagued with bad luck and construction deaths; hence, the nickname ""The Widowmaker"".<br/><br/>Vostrikov is under strict orders to complete his mission (the test firing) on schedule which the Soviet high command is pushing to have completed as soon as possible. The problem with this, a fatal flaw. is that hurrying the mission has resulted in shoddy workmanship on various ship components; they don't even have radiation suits in case of a nuclear accident the ship carrying only useless chemical suits.<br/><br/>Vostrikov (Ford) takes over the boat to some resentment by the crew, especially the officers, who favored Polenin (Neeson). The drills that Vostrikov immediately begins clearly shows the crew is unready, with some of the drills looking highly inept and chaotic - a bad reflection on Polenin. Vostrikov continues to push the crew despite injuries and even more resentment, a near-crisis comes when K-19 is ordered to dive to 300 meters (near crush depth) and then it emergency surfaces crashing right through the Arctic ice, at which point Vostrikov immediately, and successfully, launches the missile.<br/><br/>Throughout all of this Polenin advised against what Vostrikov was doing, even to the point of leaving his post in a huff and later berating Vostrikov for endangering the crew. Accurately, the captain tells his XO the men had to be pushed to the limit not only to see what they could do but to, in effect, mold them into a stronger crew ready to die as needed in the future. Their camaraderie while playing on the polar ice is indication of this.<br/><br/>Vostrikov, whom someone I read stupidly compared to ""Capt. Bligh"", was right, and Polenin, whose crew was so sloppy in drills, was mostly wrong. But there is more to this.<br/><br/>Vostrikov's father was both a Soviet hero - and a prisoner in the GULAG. Perhaps as such, he has always made special efforts to be totally loyal to his country and the Party. That blind loyalty will eventually be tested by the disaster about to befall K-19, a situation where the humanity and flexibility of Polenin will be found to be more than appropriate.<br/><br/>The boat's nuclear reactor's coolant suddenly develops a leak and fails. Despite what we heard in the film there was no real danger of ""a thermonuclear explosion""; there WAS a danger of the core melting right through the hull and likely exploding as it hit the cold water. The movie's attempts to suggest that there would a nuclear explosion and possible war between the U.S. and Soviet Union were strained. Polenin's emotionalism hits bottom when he foolishly blames Vostrikov for this disaster for having ordered the former reactor officer off the ship for being drunk on duty.<br/><br/>Vostrikov now is confronted by the horrid reality: there is no way to save the submarine and crew and avoid nuclear core meltdown without repairing the reactor coolant - and to do this sailors have to enter the radiation-filled chamber wearing nothing more than useless chemical suits. Heroically, they do, and more heroically others also do even after seeing the first repair crew leave the reactor deathly sick and vomiting. Only the new young reactor officer balks at entering this chamber of death, although he redeems himself later with great bravery. We fairly well knew he would succumb having seen him earlier kiss his fiance good-by.<br/><br/>K-19, the reactor in no immediate danger of meltdown but now filled with radiation, is forced to surface, and Vostrikov initially resists all suggestions from Polenin and others to evacuate the boat, or request assistance from the Americans who have seen the submarine. At this point, one of Polenin's officers, and even the commissar (political officer) stage mutiny and seize the vessel from Vostrikov at gunpoint. That is the same commissar who ironically earlier indoctrinated the crew with anti-American propaganda.<br/><br/>Polenin refuses to take command and puts down the mutiny. There seems little doubt now that he now understood better the loyalty and devotion to duty of Vostrikov, and how effective and cool in the crisis the captain was. Vostrikov, on the other hand, better recognizes the need to appeal to the humanity of the crew, and shows his own humanity by seeing to it K-19's sick crew is evacuated to another Soviet sub despite orders to the contrary.<br/><br/>Vostrikov and Polenin have finally reached a mutual understanding as they finally recognize and respect each other's views and methods.Together they were better than either could have been individually. The final scene twenty-eight years later at the graves of those sailors who died saving the sub and their crewmates was moving indeed.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson were excellent both separately and in their chemistry. Comments by some about their accents not being adequate are trivial, although Sean Connery's was better ""Hunt for Red October"". The rest of the cast, though no-name, was also fine. Kathryn Bigelow's direction is quite suitable and good, although it doesn't take a genius to figure out how to use moving cameras, quick cuts, and dramatic closeups aboard a submarine to great effect; there are enough submarine films out there already to supply examples.<br/><br/>One of those films, ""Crimson Tide"", depicts a different sort of power struggle between the senior captain and the new XO over nuclear launch protocol. That is entirely different than the more subtle struggle in ""K-19"" which I found fascinating.<br/><br/>The sets are suitably grimy and dark to depict a Soviet sub in 1961 that does not even appear to be very well made or especially advanced technologically. The danger of something going wrong on K-19 always seems probable.<br/><br/>""K-19"" is an intelligent film and I found it absorbing. It is not a puerile exercise in special effects. The relationship between Vostrikov and Polenin was simply compelling. A wonderful movie."

Most of the acting was top notch, especially Peter Sarsgaard, who I felt really shined in his portrayal of Vadim Radtchinko, the core reactor controller. I say most, because some of the accents were a little suspect, and with that kind of budget, a few more speech training sessions wouldn't have gone amiss.

"ksundstrom","9","1","1","12 March 2006"," Meltown on Soviet sub threatens world...
","High tension acting played brilliantly by Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson. Claustrophobic photography and uplifting music bolster the tension and the moral conflicts of the film. It is clear now that the risk of a nuclear catastrophe in the K-19 sub was real in 1961 with a probable trigger-quick nuclear retaliation by America. Unbelievable? Why then did the President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev propose in 2005 to the Nobel Peace Prize Committee that the crew of the K-19 should be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for their actions of July 4, 1961? Harrison Ford, who is half Irish and half Russian, and Liam Neeson, who is Irish, (both having much somewhat similar hardships and adventure in their youth) rose convincingly to the acting challenges of different personalities having to come to terms with higher moral ideals. They gave surprisingly inspiring performances of a higher order than the classical moral acting of Hollywood movies of the 1930's-1950's. In the Hollywood movies opposition on moral grounds to government, politicians and military authorities could lead to loss of career. In the Soviet such opposition meant either death or banishment to the frightful prisons of Siberia, etc., the Gulag. Ford, as Commandant Nikolai Vadimirovich Zateyev, is ordered to take over the command of the first submarine converted to nuclear capability from Neeson, the Commander Mihail Polenin, who stays as second in command. Ford is the person the Communist Politburo and Military consider politically reliable whereas Neeson is too undisciplined and chummy with the crew. The Soviet Union wants now to demonstrate to America that it is also a superpower with intercontinental nuclear missiles. The Amerian Navy has an observer ship near by. More importantly at stake is the Soviet's reputation in the eyes of the Third World. Its mission must not fail! Meltdown of the nuclear reactor powering the K-19 is caused by a faulty cooling circuit. (Remember the scary repercussions of Third Mile Island?). Ford knows that the intense heat from this risks a catastrophic explosion of the nuclear missiles which would also blow out of the water the American observer ship. This would could risk an automatic nuclear riposte from America against the Soviet Union. The 1960's were the years of sabre rattling and trigger happy generals. Ford cannot ask the Americans for help - a sign of Soviet weakness in the eyes of all. Neeson wants to. Thus the conflict. But as crew members voluntarily offer their lives to enter the radiated chamber to welder the leaks, the character changes between Ford and Neeson. They rise finally to a very high order - a higher moral dimension which also involves the crew. A dimension so missing from many of Hollywoods films. This lack of moral fiber in Hollywood - reflected in the recent disappointments regarding prisons in Iraq - is probably also the reason for the erroneous marketing of the film. Hopefully, Hollywood will re-find this moral fiber. Hopefully it will re-market the K-19 as a film worthy of reflection, with great action and human understanding."

","""K-19"" was widely dismissed at the time of it's release - it's too slow moving to be a summer blockbuster, it was the latest in a stream of submarine pictures, and audiences could not swallow the slumping Harrison Ford as a Russian.<br/><br/>Yet ""K-19"" is actually a very compelling film. While Liam Neeson gives what is in many way the dominating performance, Ford is good in his role. While his Russian accent is not entirely convincing, that has as much to do with the oddity of seeing Indiana Jones as a Russian sub commander as it does with Ford's abilities with accents (he's not Daniel Day-Lewis, but he's not quite Kevin Costner, either).<br/><br/>There are some extremely harrowing sequences here, and while ""K-19"" is not a classic, it's a good film."
"CRUSHTRASH","9","1","1","12 January 2004"," Atmospheric, but not exactly an Action movie
","After mixed reviews, but wanting to see Steve Nicolson's portrayal of Yuri (after his EE stint and the suspect All Men Are Mortal), I wasn't quite sure what to expect (bar some very dodgy Russian accents).<br/><br/>The case of the rental copy I have watched hypes the movie too much, and classes it as 'action' - but although the movie is actually very watchable, if a little harrowing in places, the pace is more gradually intense than action-packed! Harrison is OK, if anything Liam's demoted Captain is arguably the more interesting character, and the supporting cast give a gritty and emotional performances throughout. Aforementioned Mr Nicolson does a good job as the officer who decides to lead a mini-mutiny - although with limited success (without giving too much away). OK the (final) ending may be a little too sentimental for some, although the aging of the two leads is excellently done, and the occasional texts non-too-subtle, but all in all this film has some good moments and is genuinely claustrophobic. When the crew actually see daylight/dry land (well, ice) and play football you almost share in their relief at leaving the enclosed and cramped conditions in the sub!!!  Against expectations, an 8/10 as long as you don't take it all too literally."

","After seeing this movie I'm left with a feeling that it could have been better. The first thing that bothers me is English with Russian accent which is used. This seems totally useless and with no real importance other than letting actors practice their accents. Then there is the focus on only a few character and ignoring the development of others. Neeson and Ford played their roles routinely without any real effort and this is something the director of this movie should have worked on since the movie lies in the performances of these two characters.<br/><br/>From the technical aspect the movie looks and feels pretty good. I believe that this is the closest the crew could have come to realizing the submarine movie. The sense of claustrophobia I got from watching some scenes in this movie was particularly unnerving."

"stratocoaster","Null","1","1","20 March 2003"," Futility pervades throughout this film
","K-19: The Widowmaker is about a Russian submarine, (the pride of the Russian fleet), its crew and the many problems they encounter while trying to prove nuclear superiority to the United States. A sense of futility pervades throughout the film and the crew is made to seem pretty inept, however this contributes to the development of their desperate situation. Liam Neeson is the captain of the K-19 but Harrison Ford is sent in as his superior officer to carry out orders that only Ford knows of. He seems cruel, but he is in fact doing what he is told by his superiors. The first half-hour of the film builds the foundation of futility amazingly well. Situations involving incredibly bad luck are almost piled upon one another in first 30 minutes. Nothing goes right for these poor guys. This sets us up to feel a real sense of hopelessness for the crew. The dismal lighting technique used throughout the film in both exterior and interior shots work well to establish this particular theme of futility. Even the shots of the K-19 out in the ocean will make you feel cold and frightened. If you saw `The Hunt for Red October', you will see similarity in the filming and lighting techniques for the interior footage of both submarines. And even though both of these movies may at first seem alike and want people to moan about `another Russian sub movie' the two stories are completely different. If Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are in the same movie together, how can you go wrong? Both actors do a good job in their respective roles as captains, even though Ford's accent slips from time to time. K-19 is yet another true story which can now be told, that took place during the cold war.  If nothing else, this movie should be seen in a historical context so as to not repeat our past mistakes."
"charlesr-4","9","1","1","8 March 2003"," K-19 For what it was a great movie.
","Since the kick off of the cold war the Soviets were constantly depicted as evil, bumbling warmongers who were constantly looking for a reason to drop the ""Big One"" on us.<br/><br/>The truth is that like any war there are two sides to a conflict.  Since the fall of the cold war we have had several movies that allows people to ""look inside"" the USSR and to see what it was like.  This movie does a great job of letting Joe American see that the USSR were like us, afraid of war, not trusting of the other side and very patriotic.  Replace the Red flags, the sickle and hammer and the stylish wool hats and place the stars and stripes and you could see the intensely paranoid Cold war US doing the same thing.<br/><br/>The movie also did a good job showing the differences between what our country was like and our standards for safety and technology vs. the Soviet work or die trying.   Our history did contain that very mentality but we seemed to move past it sooner then the Soviets.<br/><br/>As for the plot.. to say that the story was based on an ""interesting event"" as was stated in other comments, is to prove that our current ADD mentality has gone to the next level.  True, there was no gunshots, no high tech explosions and no atom bomb explosions.. but this was not a true action movie, it was a drama, a documovie with action overtones.  IF you can believe that being stuck in a tin can about to explode in the largest explosion in human history and kick off a world conflict that would not only see you homeland be completely destroyed but most of the world is not exciting then go watch triple X.<br/><br/>The movie was also very accurate, the only other Soviet sub movie I can think of ""The Hunt for Red October"" was more fiction then accuracy. With sub interiors filled with pointless and way too futuristic fittings (Like neon missile tube markings) This movie accurately reproduced the sub and the operating climate in which lived. You see the technology and understand what it took to be a Soviet Submariner.<br/><br/>All in all even with some plot holes and some very exciting elements of the true story not appearing (Like a emergency surface in trials of the real boat which had is flip on its side and partially sink.) the story was good, and the characters were believable.  If you like the navy, subs and are at all interested in seeing another good sub movie its worth it."

","I will admit that this cold war submarine movie is not a revelation and that it has been done in the past much better (see Das Boot, Hunt For Red October), however i will also admit that this is alot better than the rest of the crap floating around out there right now. This movie tells the story of the torture, pain, and grief a submarine crew had to...yes i said had to endure for the good of their country. The most horrifying thing about this whole movie is that it is a true story. A Russian nuclear submarine which can't even pass inspection is sent out to sea to test a missle. Once out at sea and submerged, a seal on the nuclear reactor aboard the sub breaks leaking radiation throughout the entire submarine. With the temperture rising and the chance of a Chernobyl-like nuclear disaster, Captain Alexi Vostrikov must decide whether to try and fix the reactor or give the submarine up to the americans. With no intentions of giving the submarine up, many crew members are lined up like lambs to a slaughter. They are informed of the gravity of the situation and told they will go in groups of two for no longer than 3 minutes at a time to try and reseal the reactor. When the first group of two come back out after three minutes of working on the reactor, only then do the rest of the men see first hand the disasterous effects of radiation poisoning. As time is running out and the entire crew is becoming infected by radiation, history changing decisions must be made...whew. Alexi Vostrikov is played by Harrison Ford and Mikhail Polenin is played by Liam Neeson. Talk about emotion, it was a pleasure watching these two screen greats battle each other. The russian accents were not as pleasurable. However do not let that deter you from viewing this taut, and tightly directed movie by Kathryn Bigelow. The acting as a whole was very good and convincing. I came away from this movie knowing two things....i never want to have to endure radiation poisoning, and it scares me to think just how far people will go for their country...whether its right or wrong."

But if so, it's only the fact that it marks quite a change from the types of roles he usually chooses. We expect to see him as the self-assured, never-wrong All-American Hero and here we see him as the cocky, overbearing commander of a RUSSIAN nuclear submarine. What's crazy is that he pulls it off. The accent may not be the most believable in the world, but it's not embarrassing, either. And the performance is one of his best, I think. The torment behind the eyes ... wow. He really gets across that this guy is torn between doing his duty and doing what's best for his men. Liam Neeson lends fabulous support as his second-in-command, and for the most part the entire cast does an excellent job.

Ford comes off very believable as the hard-nosed commander who still has faith in the Communist party, while Neeson portrays well the part of a captain who believes in his crew and sees many flaws within the System. Their clashes are tense, but the underlying respect these two characters share shows through in each encounter.<br/><br/>Behind them, the crew provide a diverse backdrop. They are portrayed as people who the viewer grows to care about; you want to see them survive, and you grow to recognize their heroism, despite the odds against them. Granted, there is something a bit cliche about the one man who dies, leaving behind the love of his life... but even that is interwoven so seamlessly, you *feel* empathy for him.<br/><br/>Going into this movie, I had heard many disparaging comments concerning the accents used in the film. No, Harrison Ford is not Russian. Nor is Liam Neeson. But, like Sean Connery, they have overcome any speech issues and given us Russian sub officers to care about. And if you get hung up on the accents, you miss the strength of this film: the story and the acting."

","""K-19: The Widowmaker"" should be compared to ""The Hunt for Red October."" Steeped in Cold War-inspired dialogue, Tom Clancy and the film's director and stars gave us Soviet naval officers we could admire.  After all, the sub's skipper, Sean Connery, wanted to deliver his sparkling new and formidable vessel to the U.S.  And he wasn't looking for a cash reward. His No. 2, played by Sam Neill, died wishing he could only have seen Montana before expiring.  The ship's political officer was a stereotypical Commie. It's a good film but its exciting story made up for its lack of depth and surfeit of anti-Soviet passion.<br/><br/>Director Kathryn Bigelow, one of the few women who effectively direct action films AND understand the military mind, has given us, with a very talented cast, a first-rate film that is both derivative and original.<br/><br/>In the beginning ""Captain Mikhail Polenin"" (Liam Neeson) is, depending on your viewpoint, either the lucky commanding officer of his country's newest (in 1961) nuclear sub or the poor sap stuck with an impossible and career-ending assignment.  The pride of the Soviet sub flotilla can't get through a dry dock test without systems self-destructing.<br/><br/>The regime and the navy's satraps need K-19 to deploy immediately so that its missile system can be tested and the vessel can be stationed off the U.S. coast as a foil to U.S. subs able to launch against Moscow and Leningrad (I think the latter city's name has been changed, :) ). The high-ranking officers, now piloting chairs, reflect the exclusively strategically-oriented priorities of military men who are too removed from the men they send into harm's way.<br/><br/>Relieved of command but retained as executive officer, Polenin welcomes aboard ""Captain Alexi Vostrikov"" (Harrison Ford), touted as the best sub honcho in the Soviet Navy.  There's a lack of plausibility in any navy allowing a demoted skipper to remain as No. 2 but with the Soviets a lot of weird things happened (and this drama more or less tracks a real incident).<br/><br/>Interesting thing about the Soviet defense industry:  innovation in design (a lot of it) was more often than not followed by fiascos in production (a VERY lot of it).  K-19 is no exception and critical systems reflect poor assembly and substandard parts. Vital equipment is missing.  Almost from the moment of weighing anchor K-19 is a challenge and, as many of the crew believe, a ""Widowmaker.""<br/><br/>Polenin understands the hazards.  So does his new boss but Capt. Vostrikov is a ""damn the torpedoes [literally], full speed ahead"" sort of sailor. Lord Nelson and ADM Halsey would both have appreciated having him under their respective commands.<br/><br/>Of course a series of disasters ensue during which the crew's mettle is tested to the utmost.  The cinema's familiar, public and vocal dispute between a hard-driving C.O. and his tender-hearted, adored-by-the-crew, second-in-command follows. (Think ""In Harm's Way"" or ""Run Silent, Run Deep"").<br/><br/>The action sequences reflect the deep fear felt in the tight quarters of a submarine in trouble.  The injuries are very graphically portrayed.  World War II's wounds give way to the horrors created by a nuclear reactor gone amuck. Some younger children, even teenagers, might be very disturbed by the injury scenes notwithstanding the PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>The captain expresses anti-American sentiments but they realistically reflect his professional career and personal life behind the Iron Curtain, not the mindless blurting of party slogans.  Even the sub's political officer has a much less doctrinaire personality as opposed to his """"Hunt for Red October"" counterpart.<br/><br/>Recent books have disclosed many stories, once top secret, about the cat-and-mouse maneuvers and intelligence operations that our submarines undertook during the height of the Cold War.  Doubtlessly, more stories will emerge from Russia in coming years.  ""K-19"" is probably the most realistic film about this deadly and treacherous game of geo-politics so far.  The recent tragedy of the Russian Navy submarine ""Kursk"" and the initial almost paranoid response of some Russian admirals certainly showed that the suspicions of the Cold War are hardly vanished today.<br/><br/>What really takes this film beyond the ambit of we've-seen-it-all-before war and naval dramas is the deep humanity of the ship's crew which transcends ideology. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson turn in top-notch, convincing portraits.  Ms. Bigelow has insured that even in fast scenes and vignettes we can't miss realizing these are scared sailors and that our navy personnel would have behaved the same if confronted with similar challenges.<br/><br/>Several pre-release articles have harped on the assumed and unconvincing Russian accents of the cast (the whole script is in English).  The producer's explanation is that actors from many countries are in the film and a Russian accent was a levelling device.  No matter, you ignore it after the first few minutes.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the score is quite good and it is performed very well. That's no surprise since world-renowned conductor Valery Gergiev led the Kirov Ballet Orchestra for the soundtrack.<br/><br/>8/10."
"imyjr","10","1","1","21 July 2002"," Easily Misunderstood Tragic Film
","It is very easy to be disappointed by this film if one enters the theatre expecting an action thriller based on true events which occurred during the cold war. This is not what this movie is about.... if that is what you are looking for, rent Hunt for Red October.<br/><br/>The cold war is at its height. To maintain their side of the power equation, the Soviets launch their first nuclear submarine..... an imperfect, untested, hastily put together submersible, seemingly ignorant of the potential for atomic disaster inherent in the simplistic layoutof the ship and its reactor, devoid of protective redundancies. In addition, the ship was woefully ill equipped: manuals were missing, radioactive protective gear was not provided,  the chief nuclear staffer fresh out of school with no experience whatever.  The Cold War logic which made the USSR send such an unprepared weapon to sea,(or for that matter which fueled America's own tragedy by making it send ""advisors"" to Vietnam around this time) provides the underpinnings upon which this tale is told and upon which decisions in its narrative are taken. It is a tale of heroism and camaraderie, loyalty and patriotism. Much is sacrificed in the service of an ideology we know was false and now know was destined to fail. The message, if there is one, is that ultimate virtues are not as important as what you do for your fellow-men in your immediate situation. Heroism is defined as risking one's life for the many, knowing full well that it could result in one's own death, fully aware of the life-plans one would be giving up. Perhaps it is doubly sad when such knowing heroes are young.  There are no easily discernible villains in this movie. One can, of course, blame the bureaucratic bigwigs who sent such an unfinished product to sea and at each danger signal refused to acknowledge obvious inadequacies and shortcomings. The Cold War objective was all-commanding. Cold War logic  required the Soviets to respond in kind to the perceived threat of American nuclear submarines.<br/><br/>In the final analysis, this is a very sad movie which in its own circumscribed way evokes the sadness and waste of that whole cold war period. The acting, the mis-en-scene, the music are superb. The interaction between all the characters is peerless. Kudos in particular to Messrs. Ford, Neeson, Camargo, Sasgaard, and Ginty. There seems to be a lot of relatively newcomers in smaller roles.... all of them did well and created memorable characters in their brief parts. <br/><br/>I have found critics reluctant to praise this movie. I think they were disappointed for not seeing what they were expecting, a hang by the edge of your seat thriller, so they blame the director for not making the sort of movie they ""figured-out"" it was going to be. Such silliness. This is a movie that will be remembered."

","The real story of what happened on a nuclear sub is as heartbreaking and glorious a tale that can be told. The tragedy of what happened is off set just a little by the ability of men to rise to save their friends and to honor those who led them. <br/><br/>So it is sad that I have to report that the story of a Russian sub that has a nuclear reactor accident while at sea and has to deal with the danger inside the ship and th politics back home has been made into such a mess of a movie. <br/><br/>Harrison Ford is seriously wrong in the role of the Captain of the ship. This is probably his worst screen performance. He is aided by a cast that allow their accents to drift like a rudderless ship on the ocean.<br/><br/>
The real problem is the film making which makes the events so confused that I had to watch a program from the History Channel to get it all right in my head again. Things are so badly portrayed that there is almost no tension.<br/><br/>The high point of the film is near the end of the film where the crew comes together years after the fact  to honor their fallen ship mates. Here is the kick in heart moment that you were waiting for for the previous two hours. Except for this moment and the promise of what might have been this movie really has no reason to exist."
"tedg","Null","4","9","21 July 2002"," Ford versus Trabant
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Harrison Ford. He cannot act, at least according to my understanding of the term. But he often finds vehicles where that doesn't matter, where he can swoop along with events. In fact, his very ordinariness works to his advantage as we literally identify with him. His self-awareness isn't intelligently aware or explicit like Willis', and his appeal is more Cronkitean than Gibson's. But there is a place where he fits in. It isn't here.<br/><br/>What we have is a huge machine that is flawed, in fact two huge machines: the submarine and the Soviet Union. The tired gimmick used here is to present Ford's captain as yet a third broken machine, only to have it develop that he is wonderful anchor instead.<br/><br/>The picture is so constructed. Attention is given to impress on us the mass and power of the machine. This overlaps with drawn out sequences that show Ford as similarly blunt, powerful and broken. Finally, wrapped in crisis, there is the elevation to sainthood, something usually sauced with rousing music and closeups on earnest, loving faces. Each of these three requirements is trod through inartfully, even incompetently, and since no one cause is clear, one must blame the lack of vision or control of the filmmaker. Almost certainly, this film was produced under the circumstances described in it: ignorant edicts from above, massive expenditures but always shorted, huge expectations beyond the skills of the crew, plans that go awry and are unaddressible. The film is broken, and instead of throwing it to the American audiences (unprotected from the fallout as it were) Hollywood has gathered around in the form of a massive promotional campaign to once again save Ford's biscuits. <br/><br/>Incidentally, if you ever have been around submariners, you know it is a crowd-hushing, offensive mistake to pronounce it sub-mar'-iners (emphasis on the second syllable) as opposed to subma-rine'-ers (emphasis on the third). This is such a profound error one need not wonder why so much of the film has an inauthentic feel.

Tension can easily be felt between the two, as they constantly clash, but both share the unwavering patriotism. When the vessel's nuclear reactor system begins to leak, the two men and their crew must become brave countrymen and work together before all is lost.<br/><br/>I must admit, that I probably only had a slight interest in 'K-19: The Widowmaker' because of Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson. If it didn't featured these two stars, then a 132 minutes submarine movie may have put me off. I did find it interesting though, and really did tell a good story throughout the film. The beginning was quite slow, but the performances of Ford and Neeson were able to keep you hooked on. As the movie progressed, it did gain more interesting, especially during the last 40 minutes. The Russians accents were not that bad. I felt that Harrison Ford pulled off a good imitation, but Liam Neeson still seemed to have a slight Irish accent. The only real problem I had with the film was the length. 132 minutes can fly by with some films, whilst seem like hours for others. Unfortunately, this film was one of the slow ones. When you thought it was nearly finished, it turned out that you had another 40 minutes left.

","The Cold War began in the 1950's and lasted long into the year 2000. During these very tense and turbulent eras, tension between the Soviet Union and the U.S. nearly bankrupt both nations and their treasuries. In the end little was solved but their legacies left an indelible mark on both Countries. Among the Russian Navy's most notable disasters is the subject of this film. From an original story written by Louis Nowra and a screenplay by Christopher Kyle, this movie is Entitled "" K-19: The Widowmaker "" and it reveals the true story of Russia'a first Neclear Submarine disaster at sea. In 1959 on the maiden voyage of the K-19, Captain Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) is assigned to make a series of tests concerning his ship. His second in command is Capt.Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) who believes his commander's appointment was political and that he should have been the appointed Capt. Although much animosity between the two creates unrest among the crew, the voyage begins well enough until they are further ordered by Moscow's command officer Marshal Zelentson (Joss Ackland) to begin patrolling off the coast of America. Upon arrival, the K-19 suffers a rupture in one of the cooling systems near the nuclear reactor, endangering the nuclear War-heads. With the ship in dangering of suffering a nuclear explosion, the Capts and crew struggle to find solutions to their worsen predicament, which could result in all out Nuclear War. The acting between the cast and the main stars is incredible and strengthens the fact that Russians like Americans both have men of superior courage and patriotic zeal when danger is threatening them, their ship and their country.

","This is an outstanding film - a real 'jewel' which has received much less praise than it deserves. The historical background is fascinating (Cold War tension just ahead of the Cuban crisis) and the performances are very strong. But the real potency lies in the human issue at the centre of the story: the bizarre willingness of men to sacrifice their lives, at short notice and in desperate straits, out of duty to their comrades. (It's impossible to watch K-19 without asking yourself if you could do what they did, to search your own heart.)<br/><br/>The other thing I liked was the brilliantly filmed techno- claustrophobia of the sub itself, which becomes a pressure-cooker world in which you have to sweat it out like the protagonists. Brilliant movie - but don't watch it if you want 'The Hunt for Red October' airport-novel action thriller genre. It's not that."

","I have seen K-19 in a theater, rented it couple of times, and now own a DVD. The movie is not a dumb action flick, but a serious, intense drama, which probably explains most of the outraged comments out there. Besides, K-19 has an unexpected political dimension. It portrays Soviet sailors as heroes, who are able to give their life for a cause, higher than, say, cheap oil. Which probably explains the rest of negative comments. The acting was flawless. Especially, that of Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson. Mr. Ford was very convincing as a submarine Captain. But not only them, rest of the cast gave wonderful performances too. I can not recall single weak episode. Regrettably, this movie promotes some untrue stereotypes. In particular, I find it hard to believe any crew member of a Soviet nuclear sub might be drinking at his post. At that times, anyway. Overall, I definitely recommend the movie to everybody, except those who hate Soviet Union for beating Nazy Germany in Second World War."

","This is one of those movies that, no matter what you may have been thinking of it as you watched it, the end 'justifies the means' and it all comes right as it crosses the finishing line.<br/><br/>K19 - The Widowmaker, set at the height of the Cold War, ploughs doggedly through every cliché in the 'nuclear submarine on its maiden voyage with two captains and a dodgy reactor' book while it explores such issues as loyalty, heroism, patriotism, comradeship, cowardice, fear, bravado etc. on the personal scale and touches on the possibility of events leading to a nuclear holocaust on the global scale.<br/><br/>(I have to say at this point that, nowadays I expect *any* nuclear submarine on its maiden voyage to get to the point where it may have to be scuttled, or will sink, as the nuclear reactors on these vessels are bound to play up!)<br/><br/>The film has been well made with decent camera-work, lighting and sound although some of the technicalities were a little suspect at times - the interior of the sub was looking decidedly scruffy in places for what was supposed to be a brand new vessel and there were nothing like enough oranges to go round when supplies were being loaded! Best not look too closely at the dockyard setting and I have to say the inevitable dockyard scene with welding and grinding sparks flying everywhere would have been an immense disappointment had it been missing. (As it would also have done if Joss Ackland hadn't appeared briefly as a high-ranking Russian official....)<br/><br/>What carried this film, in my opinion, was the excellence of the supporting cast. OK, Neeson and Ford did a fairly good job of looking alternately po-faced and/or grim as the occasion demanded and managed to stay just short of the 'woodentop' mark, but the supporting cast were really quite superb. Being mostly complete 'unknowns' I had no problem accepting them as a real, if rather young, submarine crew. The film was well enough directed to ensure that they were much better used than the more usual 'standing around looking scared extras'and the standard of acting by all of them was really quite good.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film. It was solid and had its own integrity that made it a fairly uplifting experience by the time it was over. Despite ticking off every cliché as it presented itself, the pace wasn't quite as slow as it appeared, as there was continual activity and suspense. It certainly wasn't boring and the outcome was never entirely predictable. The end held no great surprises when it came, but it was well done and rounded off the story nicely.<br/><br/>Therefore 8 out of 10 for a much better than average 'non blockbuster' movie that I enjoyed watching."

","I was not supposed to like this film at all. I am not a fan of 'heroic' movies, and Tom Clancy books and films belong for me to the popular science shelves. However, I found 'K-19' to be a more interesting and in some ways better than expected movie. The film is based on the true story of a Soviet atomic submarine, going through an emergency situation in the early 60s. The subject is a good opportunity of asking some questions about the futility of the fate of very young people sent to serve in the Army (whatever Army), about characters reaching the hysteria of heroism, about the fight between discipline and common sense in a military environment. In the 'good Hollywood tradition', it does it but it goes only half way from an artistic point of view. Director Kathryn Bigelow is good in rendering the claustrophobia of the submarine life, and avoids to the possible extent the stereotypes in directing her actors. Peter Sarsgaard has a fantastic scene when doing a young officer terrorized to sacrifice his life to save other's. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are as good as you can expect. The problem is in the total absolution the film gives to Harrison Ford's character, and indirectly to the cause the characters were sent to fight for. Yes, they were heroes. Yes, they did their best for what they perceived as a just cause. Does this turn them into models in today's world? The Hollywood treatment for these Soviet era heroes does not help in answering any of these obsessive questions. 7/10 on my personal scale."

How pathetic. Star Wars alumni Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford do a great job with their parts, just ignore Harrison struggling with the accent and you'll be mesmerized by him. Liam Neeson is also fantastic, as usual. The atmosphere is dark and claustrophobic, the sets incredibly realistic and there is no American happy ending here, people really die and they don't come back. <br/><br/>In the style of Crimson Tide and Hunt For Red October, K-19 is a superior submarine/cold war epic that I highly recommend to fans of the genre. HOWEVER, if you're not into that kind of thing, steer clear.<br/><br/>McQ"

","The Soviet Union's first nuclear ballistic submarine, the K-19 is being prepared for testing.  The aim of the test will be a show of strength to American spy planes in order to ensure that America dare not strike first for fear of retaliation.  For the test the submarine is captained by Vostrikov with second in command Polenin. During the mission the submarine experiences a malfunction in it's reactor which could potentially explode. The risk is not only to the crew but a nuclear blast may set off world conflict.  The crew race to avert disaster.<br/><br/>I happily went to see this at an UK preview screening in Birmingham.  It wasn't due out for another month but I read nothing into this.  I didn't know the story or anything about the film so I was a clean sheet.  As such the film interested me as it is a story I didn't know and even if only half of the film is actually true then it is still a fascinating story.  However the film fails to deliver on the intensity of the story.  Instead we get a plodding film that is so concerned with being factual and serious that it forgets to be entertaining or involving.<br/><br/>Director Bigelow takes a story that involves sacrifice, death, tension, potential global destruction and turns it into an overlong, dull film for the most part.  Only in the final half hour do we get a feel for the excitement and tension in the submarine.  Prior to this we have an dull (yet interesting) look at drills, life on board a sub and more drills.  It's not that the story is dull but it's told at a snails pace and really misses every opportunity to turn the screws. I noticed one of the production companies was National Geographic and I can see their impact.  This isn't a Crimson Tide style film, but instead a documentary that is so worthy and serious that it forgets it has to at least engage or entertain it's audience.<br/><br/>Ford and Neeson together are good.  In fact some of the best scenes revolve around their relationship during the disaster.  Individually they are both strong with Ford's accent only wandering slightly the odd time  Neeson also slips into Russian/Irish the odd time.  The rest of the cast are OK but they don't stick in the mind.  The way we are treated to a little background information on each and a group photograph just makes it feel like the lazy character building done in disaster movies to try and make you care for the ones who may or may not die later.<br/><br/>Overall this does have it's moments and it is a story worth being told, however if you're going to make a Hollywood film then at least make it a good one!  This drags it's heels all the way to a good last 30 minutes. There are some sparks but really it feels very pedestrian.  It is interesting  but is that enough?  What should have been a gripping real life thriller with the world as the stakes is turned into a slightly dull, overlong film that just feels so damn heavy and serious that though I like it I still couldn't say I enjoyed it."

","A rather clunky cold-war maritime thriller that manages to mix plausible science with shallow propaganda in a rather cack-handed fashion - and a (mis)casting that gives the film the same sinking feeling that the submarine must have felt when it first put to sea. It's a synch that the 2-kopeck systems aboard this state of the art Russian boat ""K-19"" are going to cause the maiden voyage to be riddled with dangers, and Captain Harrison Ford who blindly believes that nothing can possibly go wrong both before and after the boat sets sail leads to loads of crew resentment - not least from Executive Officer Liam Neeson - who all see him as a sort of ""Captain Bligh"" figure. Technically, the film does evoke a genuine sense of peril and claustrophobia, but the stars don't really have enough to work with beyond their very two-dimensional characterisations and the sight of John Shrapnel (whose son Lex also features) as a Soviet Admiral is verging on the risible. It has moments of pace, and jeopardy - but they are few and far between and more than nullified by the rather dodgy CGI and really pedestrian script."

But the acting, the soundtrack and the pacing made this film gripping.
The acting first is terrific; Harrison Ford is truly convincing of course but every member of the crew as well. And seeing Neeson and Ford together is sure to enhance a movie.
The soundtrack emphasises every moment of strife, action and despondency that these people suffer. Finally the pacing is just right.

"Leofwine_draca","5","0","0","4 January 2020"," Thematic interest, undeveloped thrills
","K-19: THE WIDOWMAKER is one of director Kathryn Bigelow's less well-known films, a character study set aboard a Russian nuclear submarine. It's supposedly based on true events from the 1960s, but the main focus is on offering a battle of wits between two Hollywood heavy-hitters: Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson. It's a tale of courage and leadership, of responsibility and the familial relationships between naval crew members. There are also thriller aspects woven into the plot, particularly those involving a radiation leak on board. The latter don't work as well, never being particularly exciting or disturbing as in rival fare like CRIMSON TIDE or even the recent CHERNOBYL. Watchable for the cast, then, but the director's HURT LOCKER blows this away in terms of movie-making."

","21 July 2002. I was at first encouraged by the first half of this movie when it seemed that America would get a rather diverse perspective of a high stakes military thriller of a movie. But by the end of the movie I was disappointed that the movie turned into the usual typical American pumping support of individualism and bravado along with the evil Russian empire. There were plenty of plot confusions, moral reversals. It's sad that the movie didn't play more on the personal plight, human relationships (husband/wife) possibilities. The actual ending of the movie was different and in keeping with the more high level of substantive movie making than an action film. The special effects and acting were good. The movie kept my interest throughout if not simmering in my seat because of the apparent flaws in movie logic (not human logic). I also have many doubts about what ""inspire"" by true events meant. The actual events might have been much more entertaining I suspect. This is a good summer movie with plenty of intensity and action and political intrigue, but it could have been so much better. 3 out of 5 stars."

","The Widowmaker (2002): K-19: The Widowmaker is a war movie without a war, or at least without a hot war. Like Crimson Tide the film uses the backdrop of a potential nuclear holocaust to generate a powerful sense of escalating tension. And that's not the only common ground. As with Crimson Tide, the majority of the movie takes place in the belly of a submarine with the threat of mutiny in the air, and, as with Thirteen Days, the events depicted herein are based on a nearly catastrophic incident from the 1960s. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow and starring Harrison Ford this is one taut film."

","I only watched this because it is directed by Kathryn Bigelow, who directed the superb The Hurt Locker. I had my reservations, as it looked like a standard Harrison Ford / submarine thriller, albeit based on a true story.<br/><br/>Turns out it was I expected, but isn't too bad. Has some originality, and captures the claustrophobia and danger of a submarine well. Would have been better without Harrison Ford though. He gives his usual stony-faced man-for-a-crisis routine, and comes across as fairly wooden.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson's character is also fairly irritating, basically just suggesting the opposite to Harrison Ford's, at every opportunity.<br/><br/>Ultimately, a fairly interesting capturing of an unknown event in naval history, an event which could have resulted in far more horrific consequences than it did."
"rmax304823","5","0","0","9 January 2016"," Disaster At Sea.
","A sad and confused movie. It's not Kathryn Bigelow's finest hour as a director but I don't image there's too much that could have been done with the script, which seems as hastily thrown together as the submarine itself.<br/><br/>The most egregious jolt to continuity probably arrives near the end. Liam Neeson, the Executive Officer, has been a paragon of good sense throughout, pleading the cause of humanity in the face of skipper Tom Ford's blockheaded determination to stretch his boat's envelope and refuse aid from an American ship nearby.<br/><br/>The crew mutinies. They handcuff Ford, who sometimes seems deranged, and turn over the boat to Neeson. The officers agree with the act. The commissar initiates the act. Then Neeson's character, with a pistol in his hand, spins around in a neat ""about FACE"" and releases Ford from his shackles, turning command back over to him with a big smile. The non sequitur drops to the deck with a heavy CLUNK heard throughout the boat.<br/><br/>There is little joy on K-19. The boat itself was hastily assembled in an attempt to keep up with US innovations and the recklessness showed up repeatedly in one accident after another. The photographer and art director turn the boat into the kind of dismal mechanical prison that no US submarine ever looked like. The lights are low, the fittings shabby and peeling, the bulkheads warped and fragile. It's enough to kill your appetite if you're not eating caviar and drinking red wine.<br/><br/>But I can see why this was greenlighted. ""Das Boot"" had been a great critical and commercial success a decade earlier. ""Das Boot"" was a movie about a German U-boat in wartime and it invested its characters with human features. This is a Hollywood movie that tries to do the same thing for the USSR that ""Das Boot"" did for Germany. Except that now we have CGIs which allow more in the way of fires and explosions than Wolfgang Peterson had in 1982.<br/><br/>As the captain, Ford is rather dull; Neeson is a more animated and thoughtful figure; Peter Sarsgaard as the reactor officer is winning in a naive boyish way. Loved his cowardly refusal to enter the irradiated Compartment of Doom.<br/><br/>The whole thing can be construed as a post Cold War analogy. The Russian people were just as good as anybody else but their leadership was whimsical and stupid."

","K-19: The Widowmaker is a story that is based on true events set during the Cold War Era. The Russians are carrying out a series of tests out in the Atlantic when their reactor ends up badly damaged which results in several crew members being badly exposed to radiation. As a result Captain Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) and his crew must put everything they learnt into practice to prevent a catastrophic nuclear incident from occurring.<br/><br/>I knew very little about this film when I started watching it, but quickly became interested when I learnt that it was 38 years after the events had taken place that anyone was able to talk about what had happened - the fall of Communism was what allowed this story to be told.<br/><br/>The issue I had with this film is that it really only has three components to it; there's all the drills and training that we see (early on with Neeson and his crew) then later out at the sea with Ford in charge of the mission. Then there is the failure of the reactor and then we have the final sequence of events and the ending. Bigelow stages the action well and the various close ups, claustrophobia and obvious pain that we see from some of the men did help to at least keep me involved in what she's put in front of me. The problem I had with this film is that it was a tad repetitive - the drills and training kept me involved for about 30 minutes, but when you're seeing the same thing for about an hour it does start to get a bit boring. The second half focuses on the reactor breaking down and again it adds excitement and intensity, but again only in short bursts. If you have 120 minutes worth of film that only focuses on two things then you really need to make these two things compelling, exciting, intense and/or entertaining for at least the majority of the time. Sadly, K-19; The Widowmaker doesn't do this consistently enough making it a very much hit and miss affair.<br/><br/>There are some positives here and firstly it has to be said that Neeson and Ford were both very good here (even though their Russian accents were a bit dodgy): both men play-off well against each other and the power struggle that they face against each other make their scenes interesting to watch. Bigelow's direction is superb, the cinematography is excellent and the action sequences are framed together very well. The final sequence of events are also very moving.<br/><br/>K-19: The Widowmaker isn't a bad film, but it is a little repetitive and drawn out and for those reasons it isn't entirely successful across its 133 minute running time. It's worth a look for historical reasons, but it's far from being a great film."

","AMC says this movie was destined for greatness but as they put it ""It slipped under the radar."" Witty and poetic to be sure. Submarine movies in my opinion generally are good ones and this wasn't below par. I probably wouldn't watch it frequently but perhaps if there isn't anything else on I would. The plot is Ford's submarine the K-19 is out during the Cold War patrolling when it has an accident on board involving it's nuclear reactor and the whole crew is in danger of being killed or worse yet captured by the American forces and if they are released they will be sent to a Gulag in Siberia if not outright executed. Ford is pretty good yeah he screws up the accent but who cares so has a lot of other actors big deal. His character is believed to be a royal bastard by the viewer for 3/4 of the movie then does an about face and becomes a selfless hero which comes as quite a shock I was speechless. Good showing by Liam Neeson whose character can't stand Ford but is uncharacteristically loyal as well to him and ends up becoming his biggest supporter in a play that neither character could have anticipated."

I recall the cold war posturing by the USA and the Soviet Union, and this movie dramatizes the fate of the newest Soviet nuclear submarine. Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson star as the Captain and his first mate, the former Captain. Ford plays a taskmaster who won't let up, won't quit having is new crew practice emergency drills, even when some of them become injured, because he suspects their fate will depend on how well the crew will respond when a crisis really arises. A bit slow in the middle, still, a good movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS follow, please read no further. <br/><br/>After breaking through the Arctic ice, and a successful test missle launch, the sub and crew are assigned to patrol the Atlantic east of the NY and DC areas.  A leak develops in the nuclear reactor section, cooling is lost to one reactor, and if not arrested would heat to the point of destroying the sub, killing all aboard, and perhaps detonation of nuclear weapons aboard. A fix is planned, but requires entering the reactor chamber without proper radiation clothing, 10 minutes per person, radiation burns and sickness, vomiting, fix works but sub crippled, deadly radiation spreading aboard sub, mutiny is attempted, USA ship offers help, rejected, a Russian sub shows up, defied Moscow orders and get men off ship, court martial, aquitted, he and crew sworn to secrecy, until the 1989 fall of the Communistic regime in the USSR, when the whole crew gathered to honor the dead, and to toast the Captain.<br/><br/>Good movie, especially for those of us who lived through the period."

Claustrophobia is emphasized, perhaps more so than in any other previous submarine film. Kathryn Bigelow (the director) accomplished this by keeping the interior dimensions of the sub as they were in the actual Soviet fleet.  By avoiding enlargements of the sets, they had to be resourceful in camera placement, and this leads to interesting camera angles throughout the film.         <br/><br/>          Overall, this is a wonderful film.

This movie tells the story of the unfortunate, and unnessasary torture, misery, and grief that a submarine crew had to endure for their communist country, and worst of all...it's a true story. I have never or ever had to wonder what radiation poisoning would be like, but i have to say after veiwing this film, i would never want to have to find out. Thats right, i said have to, for these poor men who have been taught to do anything and everything for their country, had no choice. While aboard Russias first nuclear submarine that cannot pass inspection, two commanders and their crew go out to sea to test a missle. Once at sea and submerged, a seal on the nuclear reactor breaks, leaking radiation into the sub. Crewmen are then lined up like lambs to a slaughter and told to go in groups of two and try to reseal the reactor, not staying in the reactor room for more than three minutes at a time. The reactor they are told must be resealed before it gets to hot and explodes. After the first two members go in, the other crew members begin getting ready for their turn. When the first group of two come back out after three minutes, only then do the other crew members see first hand the horrors of radiation poisoning. The acting by all involved is strong throughout the entire movie. Harrison Ford and Liamm Neeson give great performances, and its fun to watch these two great actors battle each other. However, the russian accents were dreadful. This type of movie has been done much better...(see Das Boot ), but this is still a worthwhile effort by all involved. Kathryn Bigelow keeps the action taut and tight. Do yourself a favor, rent this movie and see for yourself just how far people will go for their country, whether it's right or wrong."

A Submarine, bearing nuclear missles is sent to rest off the coast of New England.  K-19, dubbed ""The Widowmaker"" because of its consistently bad problems, deaths in the crew, etc.<br/><br/>Hollywood, once again, takes an old story and shoves it in a different setting.

Remember how it was just an accident, after an accident, after an accident, and how the accidents are solved are the only thing that truly drove the story along?<br/><br/>
Now here we have K-19.  A sub that was doomed from the start.  We knew the Titanic-style ending here.  And I, personally was left feeling very bummed out.  Many crewmembers died.. for what?  Each other.. but for what?  A stupid test rocket in the middle of the arctic?  Are we supposed to believe that this is an honorable thing?  Perhaps we do such tests ourselves, but I don't think it's a valuable and inspiring tale for Hollywood to tell.  I found the whole thing rather depressing.<br/><br/>Not to mention that the whole Cold War nuclear sub thing has been done to death.  In fact.. NO MORE SUB MOVIES!  There's really not much to do in here.. dive.. have drills... dive.. raise the ship.. have another drill. I felt it to be a whole movie about Gene Hackman (AKA Crimson Tide) having bad drills all over again.  The message was given to us the first time.  We don't need too see one bad drill after another.  I almost expected to see a ""montage"" scene of the crew in training on the sub while Ford wins over the crew's morale.  Pretty lame.<br/><br/>Well, Ford and Neeson were in top form here.

Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are both good in their roles, as we would expect them to be, and the portrayal of other submariners seemed credible to me. Of course there is much underlying doubt about how close it all is to the way it actually happened, particularly as Hollywood isn't exactly noted for adherence to historical accuracy, but the basic facts aren't in dispute - scary stuff!"

","Watching movies on planes is an interesting experience, because often they are the kind of movies I would never watch otherwise. K-19 is exactly the kind of movie I would not watch, even if it were broadcast on network TV. The movie is about Harrison Ford facing difficult moral dilemmas--this premise leaves little room for surprise.<br/><br/>Indeed, there is very little surprise about the plot of the movie, but there are, usually pleasant, surprises in other places. <br/><br/>The first one is a rather successful take on moral ambiguity, moral dillemmas and even the inevitable tragedy coming out of that. Because the protagonists are not American the movie does not have to patriotically and unambiguously identify the good guys and the bad guys, exalt the former and demonize the latter. Also, it is not the case that the good guys must prevail. This leaves room for some interesting character development, especially the sacked Cpt Polenin (Neeson) and the terrified junior officer in charge of the reactor. Cpt Vostrikov (Ford) is also an interesting enough character, retaining his moral ambiguity until the very end. We never know what his real motives are, and we never know if he is for real.<br/><br/>The attempt of making a character-driven blockbuster movie is brave and I appreciate it. It is doubtful that it can work though. The explosions are not big enough to excite the crowd who goes for the blockbuster part, and the ambiguity of the movie is perhaps confusing. The character development, on the other hand, is still rather simplistic and it will not impress the more discerning viewer. <br/><br/>On the negative side, I thought the Russian-ness of the movie did not work very well at all. The crew had the stiff and caricatural demeanor usually associated to Russians by typical cold war movies. I just can't buy that that's the way the Russian sailor acts.<br/><br/>But I want to end on a positive, because I did like the movie, warts and all. There is some genuine high drama in the movie, especially the ritual of sailors preparing to walk into the reactor room to fix the leak, to certain horrendous death. There is also some genuine insight in Capt. Vostrikov comment in the conclusion of the movie.<br/><br/>Not bad for a plane movie at all."

","A film which presents in an heroic light the Soviet crew of a nuclear submarine at the height of the Cold War is probably not what American audiences want to see in the aftermath of September 11th. Furthermore, unlike more conventional sub movies, such as ""The Boat"" or ""U-571"", this is one where essentially there is no enemy and not a single sonar blip. It is the work of an American woman, producer and director Kathryn Bigelow, where the only American on show is a helicopter crew member and the only woman to make an appearance is the tearful partner of one of the crew. So the whole thing is - so to speak - swimming against the tide. <br/><br/>It is all rather predictable and wooden with a weak script, yet it still is worth seeing - the production values are high, there is sustained drama, and it was ""inspired"" by an actual event. K-19 is the first of the Soviet Union's nuclear-powered submarines and is forced to go to sea with a host of known technical and logistical deficiencies with two rival captains on board. One could almost imagine the movie being shown to an MBA class studying leadership models, as we see the dramatically conflicting styles of command of the tough Alexei Vostikov (Harrison Ford) and the more tender Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson). If they get it wrong, they'll not only lose their crew, but they could provoke a nuclear war. Ultimately though, this is a tribute to the resourcefulness and bravery of crew members individually and collectively. There are some bad accents, but some tense moments, and it would be a shame if the movie sunk without trace."

","I felt the first half of this flick should have been under the title, ""Ten reasons not to join the submarine corp."" Don't worry there isn't a one in a million chance I'd ever do that. But as the tension between Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson grew, the movie became more unpredictable. One reason the movie was unpredictable is Ford's recent bad guy rolls. This might sound like a minor reason to add to the tension, but even though Ford is a bigger star, Neeson's character is better liked than Ford, Neeson is taller, which put the two on equal footing. The reality of a true story? The world just about ended because of a poor quality Soviet submarine. I'd like to think that was the only one, but are ""ours,"" any better? So the movie was rather scary. The movie showed the humanness of the soviet man and in the end Ford makes the comment. ""They did it because of comradeship."" I also like his reference to God.

","I loved Bigelow's ""Strange Days"" not because it was flawlessly crafted but because it was intelligently and ambitiously crafted.  The same is true here, although the subject matter makes for a less-than-exhilarating film experience compared to the action genre pacing of her previous works.  Here, you have a complex character in Harrison Ford.  An intelligent man who believes in his country, who is perhaps pushed to be an ultra-patriot by the shadow of his father, and yet who sees the bigger picture better than his ""liberal"" first officer (Liam Nielson) and, of course, his superiors.  He makes mistakes and he makes the best decisions which those mistakes afford him.  Decisions based on the big picture beyond the troubled sub.  This is not ""the Hunt for Red October.""  It is it's own film.  Whereas, ""October"" had the cat-and-mouse game between men and the superpowers they represented, ""K-19"" is strictly told from the POV of the Soviets and the tension is borne by the differences between takes of ideology rather than differences of ideology.  Everyone is a Soviet here---just to a greater or lesser degree. A wonderful character/ideological study.  Kudos to all the actors and creative/production teams."

","This story is `inspired' by true events that happened at the height of the cold war. Even so, you have already seen all of the basic elements of this film, in other (and arguably better) films.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is one of the best journeyman actors in American films. But he has a non-threatening quality about him that makes him unsuited to play the autocratic captain assigned to carry out the mission at any cost. Unfortunately, Liam Neeson shares this softer quality with Mr. Ford, so even a role switch wouldn't have worked well.<br/><br/>For me, the breakout scene-stealer of this movie was Peter Sarsgaard. Playing a nuclear reactor officer fresh out of school, he fairly sparkles every time he's on camera. He gets to really chew the scenery in one of the tensest moments in the film, and I predict that someone besides me is going to notice his special qualities. If they sold stock in this guy I'd be loading up!<br/><br/>For students of these sorts of things, you are going to see some amazing cinematography (just what kind of camera booms do they have nowadays?), some very mediocre special effects (think Hunt For Red October), some really, really great costumes (do I smell an Oscar?), and submarine interior sets that you would never believe are sets. The other Oscar that this movie is going to be in the running for is makeup. You're also going to like the music a lot.<br/><br/>There just isn't enough story, characters, or action to fill the two hours, so you're going to have to sit through a lot of sweeping shots of Mr. Ford atop the sub's conning tower as the boat cuts through the water.<br/><br/>Bottom line: If you're a Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson fan (like me), or if you're a submarine movie fan (again, guilty), or if you remember what the world was like when America and the USSR were constantly teetering on the brink of war (I'm 3 for 3), then you should see this movie. Everyone does good jobs of acting, and the movie is generally easy on the eyes."

","I've heard some critics say that K-19 won't or perhaps shouldn't do well because Soviets are portrayed as the heroes of the movie.  Well, that's a bunch of kaka.  The fact is this is a movie about men who made tough decisions and acted heroicly to save each other from certain doom.  Perhaps they were thinking outside the sub and wanted to save the world too.  I don't necessarily want to get that romantic about it, but still these were brave men who acted admirably under far more stressful situations and conditions than we will probably ever face in our lives.  That being said, kudos to Kathryn Bigelow, Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson and the entire cast and crew for making an intelligent, taut movie.  It doesn't dumb itself down at any point.  It is more a movie about bravery than a true action movie (i.e., Crimson Tide or The Hunt For Red October).  Personally, I wouldn't mind saluting the real crew of the real K-19 for being the brave men they were. I know it's a movie, so perhaps the real events and motivations were romanticized or glossed over.  I wouldn't know that.  But if the real men on K-19 acted with a fraction of the bravery this movie exhibited, they'd still be deserving of our most sincere respect.  A fine movie."

","I don't fault much in this movie. The acting was nice; the special effects were nice; the men turned cripsy critters were... well, you know, pretty ""realistically"" disqusting. Wrap up all that and you have a nice summer movie. I liked the fact that the movie's viewpoint was from those living behind the Iron Curtain, where the Americans were viewed as evil. I got a kick out of that. You also got to see Soviet males fear Americans as much as American males feared the Soviets during a very hectic time filled with tension. I particularly liked the authentic goings-on with Russian command, how the Russians would rather die than give up their boat or lose their reputations. I had a problem, however, with the movie's ending. Particular a very un-Russian sentimentality. I've studied Russians over the years; especially their conduct fighting the Germans on the Eastern Front during World War II. This is a race where hardships were endured and almost embraced. Afterall, this is a country who had Russian villages charged German defenses to ""use up most of the Nazi bullets"" before the soldiers were sent into the lead storm. This is the country who launches their cosmonauts onto tin-can space stations and keep them up there for a year, risking major psychie damages. <br/><br/>In the movie, the Russians cared about their men. In reality - in a Communist society - individuals don't mean anything when compared to the masses. <br/><br/>The Russians have lost countless subs over the decades, K-19 would have proved no differently. The ending where the seven men who died from radiation was something you would see from Americans, or western Europeans, and NOT from hardened Russian men brought up in a Communist state where there is no such thing as an ""individual.""<br/><br/>Because of this ""American-like"" unauthentic sympathy by the surviving boat members for their fallen members, I give this movie a '4'.<br/><br/>Bogus."

","As I was watching K-19: The Widowmaker, the new submarine thriller starring Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson, something occurred to me.  There is no better setting for a suspense-filled epic than a submarine.  The claustrophobia, the incessant clanking of tons of water attacking the hull, the fast-paced action with which everyone must utilize in their duties, all of it adds to the mix.  This is even before we are given a story. 	Of course, in terms of this film, that story is based on actual events.  In 1961, as the US and USSR were on the brink of war, the Russians were busy testing their newly designed ballistic-class submarines.  The first of its kind, K-19, was to position itself within American range and fire a test missile giving us the same fears about the Russians that they had about us. To say the very least, the mission is both a success and a complete failure from the getgo. 	Ten people die before the ship even sets to sea.  The champagne bottle used to christen the ship does not break  more of a superstitious discomfort than anything.  The ship's original captain (Liam Neeson) is demoted to executive officer.  Once the new captain arrives (Harrison Ford), the crew becomes even more uncomfortable.  None of this weighs in well when the ship is finally put to sea. 	Directed by Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break, Strange Days), K-19: The Widowmaker knows how to work its audience.  The director operates around the tense setting with ease, swinging the camera around these men running up and down tight hallways.  Of particular notice are the shots where we pan up from inside the submarine to the dark waters only a few feet past the steel walls.  Bigelow incorporates such a shot two or three times throughout the film, and each time it lets us know just how dangerous of a predicament these men are in. The script by Louis Nowra and Christopher Kyle does a nice job of not dumbing itself down to the audience.  It has impressive character development  we truly care about these men who are at war with us.  The way the film talks about nuclear war is equally striking.  The film makes you truly think about how they saw us during this time seeing as how we were the only country to ever actually drop a nuclear bomb on someone. However, through all of this, the story kind of plods along never revealing much more than we need to know.  Now, I said it does not dumb itself down, but more depth to the story of what the Russians really were trying to accomplish would not have been disregarded.  Instead, we are left to assume the motives that everyone has on and off the submarine.  It is only when the nuclear core onboard springs a leak and begins to heat up that the story kicks it into high gear. Something else that would have helped the film would have been a little bit of humor.  I mean, I know they are possibly out to start World War III, but a bit of wit here and there would not have hurt.  With all of the water trying to get in, it wouldn't have hurt to make the story a little less dry. Ford, playing the hard-edged captain who puts the mission before the men, once again puts in his two-cents worth as the bad-guy who's not so bad. Digging up the muses he conjured up for The Mosquito Coast and What Lies Beneath, he casually hides behind a hard exterior that seems to only have one, grim expression.  This on top of his `now he has it now he doesn't' Russian accent, and you've got yourself a less than convincing job by one of today's greatest actors.  He didn't feel the part.  He didn't seem to care about the film that he was doing.  He just cashed his check, spoke his lines, and sat in his trailer thinking up ideas for Indiana Jones 4. If there is a worthwhile performance, it is Neeson who compellingly makes us believe the emotion his character has for these men.  They are his family, and, even though he is no longer the father, he can still take care of them. Well, in terms of acting, Neeson takes care of his part, and, though it is difficult, he almost manages to hold up the rest of the show as well. K-19: The Widowmaker, much like the events that it is based on, is a sink or swim kind of film.  When it works, it works perfectly.  When it's off by little more than a bit, it just does not feel right.  To say the least, it is the kind of film that is hard to talk about.  It is not good enough to be passionate about it.  It is not bad enough to be sarcastic about it.  It simply is, and it probably won't be remembered for it.<br/><br/>

","I am a Harrison Ford fan, and at first when he appeared with his fake Russian accent, I was wondering whether the whole film I would just be distracted by the wrong person in the main role. Instead, I was almost immediately sucked in by the action sequences. And, unlike ""The Hunt for the Red October"", there are actual characters in this movie, even though they are all men! In fact, they are not only characters, but plighted heros whose loyalty to their country and their people is shown more powerfully than in most U.S. war films. It quickly ceased to be a ""Harrison Ford movie"" and just became a great historical drama...from the perspective of the other side. Ford was perfect for the part.<br/><br/>There is also beautiful cinematography (some of the shots of the submarine are just breathtaking) and a plot that is easy to follow. I fell asleep during ""The Hunt for the Red October"" (twice), but this one kept me on the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen to these ill-fated men (I didn't read my history books, and even if I had, I wouldn't have known how accurate the portrayal was going to be). I'm assuming the denouement was chosen because that was what really happened, so I won't criticize it, although I will say that it was not what I expected, and I'm still not sure whether I liked it.<br/><br/>I would like to warn potential audiences that there are some realistic scenes in this movie which are very difficult to watch. They make you really feel for the characters but they are unquestionably gruesome. This is not a pleasant movie! But the story is worth telling, and this film tells it quite well. So, if you are willing to hide your eyes if you need to, and you want to feel for two hours like you are a Russian Communist and these people are your heros, go see this film. Otherwise, if you are not interested in the melodrama and the grotesque, realistic depictions, just read the history books."
"schappe1","Null","0","0","20 July 2002"," A battle without an enemy
","All submarine films start out with great potential as action dramas: the claustrophobia, the danger, the companionship and conflict between the crew members. They require an intelligent script and good acting but they generally get it, as they do here. The problem is one of variety. You have the looks through the periscope, the firing of the torpedoes, the explosions of the target ships, the depth charges, the waiting for enemy torpedoes to see if they are going to hit or miss...and what else? Well K-19 doesn't even have any of that. And yet it works. <br/><br/>	What it ultimately has is a drama about courage. The one thing it has in common with other famous submarine movies is a conflict between the captain and his second in command. This time it isn't Burt Lancaster and Clark Gable, (as in ""Run Silent, Run Deep""-1958), or Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman, (as in ""Crimson Tide""-1995) but rather Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford. the basic difference between them is that Neeson, the former captain of the ship who has been superseded by Ford for this mission, (as was Lancaster's character), looks at his crew as ""a family"" with ultimate loyalty to each other. The captains job is to protect them from harm. Ford's concept is that, with the stakes that exist in a nuclear world, the captain has to be willing to push the crew to their limit and beyond, if necessary because the consequences effect not only them but the entire world. He is willing to sacrifice his crew, if necessary, to the greater good. Neeson is not. But Neeson knows how to gain their trust and loyalty and Ford does not. Eventually, both men have to learn from each other.<br/><br/>	The test comes when the cooling system of the nuclear reactor breaks down and must be repaired by men who are willing to enter a chamber where the temperature is literally hot enough to boil their liquids and heavily radioactive to make repairs. They know they are going to die, although nobody admits it. Neeson here learns that, at least in the military service, men have to be sacrificed for the greater good. Ford learns to care about them. Neeson's conversion is not handled as well as Ford's, (far too abrupt, with no warning that he is even starting to think differently- I contrast that unfavorably with Lancaster in ""Run Silent Run Deep"", where he learns the wisdom of what Gable was doing when he takes command). The ending reinforces both points of view. <br/><br/>	This is not a very pleasant movie to watch, with the normal tension and claustrophobia being supplemented by the horror of the burns sustained by the heroes who go into the reactor. But it's intelligent, creatively photographed, (with many ""comin' right atya"" scenes) and splendidly acted, especially by Ford and Neeson, who's Russian accents are hardly convincing but whose performances certainly are. Ford's game face has never been fiercer. He has to be the grumpiest looking hero the movies have ever produced, although here he certainly has good reason. <br/><br/>	The film has the same basic premise as ""The Hunt for Red October""- a technologically advanced Russian submarine is sent to the Atlantic on it's first mission. But it's not a Tom Clancy thriller. It's something that really happened. It's far better than ""Crimson Tide"" which had an unlikely premise, (I think the captain would on his own done exactly what the exec did and was overdone. This one is pure human drama."

Badly trailing the US in the arms race, the Soviet Union is out to make the point that they have some capabilities, and that a nuclear strike on Moscow or another major city will result in quick, devastating retribution.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson brings a great deal of likeability to the character of Captain Mikhail Polenin, who is demoted to Executive Officer from his original position of Captain of the K-19, the first Communist nuclear-powered submarine, when a drill that is being overseen by top Communist officials goes wrong because of second tier equipment.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is Captain Alexi Vostrikov, the son of a member of the Bolshevik revolution who died in the Gulag because of ""loyalty"" issues. While it is unusual and humorous to see ""Jack Ryan"" as a Russian, Ford brings an intensity to his role that commands attention.  Vostrikov is under severe pressure to make sure K-19 is the best thing ever to happen to the USSR.  Throughout the first part of the movie, he pushes the sub to its limits, which results in problems for the sub later on.  The crew is all but enthusiastic about the voyage, as they believe the ship to be doomed, with good cause- 10 people died before the ship left port, and the champagne bottle bounced off the sub at the christening.<br/><br/>The first 45-50 minutes does kind of drag on for a while, but there are some moments that are played out quite well.  Once the movie enters its main plot, things start to roll and never stop till the end, keeping your attention.<br/><br/>After a successful test missile is launched, K-19 is ordered to proceed past the NATO base and close to the eastern seaboard of the USA, where it would be perfectly lined up to fire on D.C. or New York if need be.  But after a pressure leak in the nuclear reactor, the crew of K-19 finds itself fighting for their lives, and questioning their loyalties.<br/><br/>I was amazed by how much I forgot during the movie that I was watching a true story, a story that, if one or two things had been different, could have gone down as the start of WWIII.  The moviemakers do a good job of causing you to forget that you are watching past enemies, and instead lead you to look on these characters as fellow human beings that want to get home and be with their families, or at least with one character, get married. It is easy to forget that you are watching people that were trained to blow up your country.  Having lived close to D.C. my whole life, it can be unsettling to think of what is going on out there that you have no clue about.  In this case, the story of K-19 couldn't be told 'till communism fell in 1989.<br/><br/>While not Ford's best, it certainly ranks up there with some of the bigger name war films(my favorite sub movie remains the incredible U-571), if not just for its thought provoking content.  I like how it points out the failure of the communist system, and it reminds its audience to be thankful that they live in a free country."
"jlkramer-2","Null","0","0","23 July 2002"," What are critics TALKING about???
","So it seems that historians and critics alike have destroyed the submarine epic K-19: The Widowmaker in any way they can. Historians have a valid reason. Critics on the other hand, do not, unless their complaint is a lack of historical accuracy. Granted, the film doesnt EXACTLY stick to the events or the characters portrayed in them, but leave the criticism for those who were involved. (Believe me, they're doing what they can to smash the film for portraying the underwater fellows as alcoholics instead of professionals). Remember, this is a MOVIE. Not a documentary. And no matter how close a film is to its true events, it will never actually hit it, because after all, it is an adaptation. (Hey, Braveheart wasn't even CLOSE to historically accurate, but it won a bunch of accolades including Best Picture and Director oscars, not to mention, our hearts.) Getting history out of the way, let's now venture to the film itself. If you weren't involved and absorbed in this movie, you're as cold as the person you last had a funeral for. I have a theory as to why this film is receiving bad reviews. It was trashed before it was even released. First and foremost is because of the title. It simply sounds like a B-Movie, but when you actually see the film, you realize its pretty legit. Secondly are the previews. Going into this film, I was CONVINCED Harrison Ford was going to suck as a Russian, with a truly reproachable accent and maybe the worst performance of his career. I was CONVINCED the film would be just another submarine movie to put on my list of dont-sees. I was wrong, by both accounts. This film has a great story, incredible acting, and lets just face it it's made in such a way that you are grabbing your seat in excitement from minute 1 to minute 138. I have not been so truly engulfed in a movie in a very long time. The suspense and unpredictability puts this film at a pace thats nearly intolerable, but just tolerable enough to enjoy the hell out of. While we're truly involved in not knowing what the fate of this ship and its crew is, we are becoming more and more acquainted with the characters at sea and their struggle between patriotic loyalty and the fight to save their own lives (and possibly the lives of many others). It is a film that constantly questions what matters more: the fight of a nation or the embracing of life and life's values. Characters are constantly in the struggle between human morals, self-sacrifice, and the ever-pledging loyalty of Russian patriotism. And this struggle only brings K-19's actors to incredible depths, deeper than the 300 ft they can't afford to sink to, but inevitably do. The accents in this film can be criticized and praised all at once. While they are often very slight, they remain consistent. I never heard Harrison Ford perform with an accent before (unless you include his brief French comedic impersonation in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade) but it seems he's a natural at it. The actors' accent coach went to great lengths to make sure these fellows were believable, and for the most part, they surprisingly are. Each major character has something distinguishing about them that we can't help but either identify with, or simply admire and aspire to be. Harrison Ford's unwavering loyalty to his nation; Liam Neeson's reason- his worry and care for his crew and the other lives at stake; the man in charge of the boat's reactor, and his incredible fear of the chemical radiation that he must eventually dive into, to save the ship. And when all three of these characters come together at the end, with their own personalities and their own morals, it is so moving, even Harrison Ford's strong-as-steel character breaks into tears that only inflict the audience to do the same. And even at that kind of depth, the film still manages not to be pretentious. Within this dramatic story, its wonderfully conveyed characters, and a heart-racing pace, comes a truly remarkable film that should only be condemned for the same historical fallacies that every film adaptation ultimately makes. And unless you're one of those historically anal freaks, there is no reason why you shouldn't enjoy this incredible film. Don't miss it."

","What a shame Summertime movie audiences didn't beat the heat with this thriller chiller from Paramount. K-19, The Widowmaker came in third to overall weak numbers on it's opening weekend tied behind the Stuart Little Sequel and the Road to Perdition.<br/><br/>OK, the title didn't help. No, it's not about a death climb on Everest or nearby peaks. And it's not about skateboards either. It's a submarine movie and a really good one too. Like the great grandpappy of all sub flicks, Run Silent Run Deep, you've got a handsome young captain who loves his crew and they love him and a grizzled new older captain who loves no one. Drill, drill, drill, dangerous mission. In the Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster roles you have Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson respectively.<br/><br/>The only drawback here is that these guys are just too darn good-looking to be Russians. And no Don Rickles either, pussycat. No comic relief anywhere. You see, these guys are Commies and it's 1961, the height of the cold war insanity. If you weren't around at the time, we were four minutes to midnight at any given moment. As in, ka-boom, it's all over now, baby blue. And the 'Inspired by true events' disclaimer at the beginning means here's another example of just how close we came to the last shot in the original Plant of the Apes.<br/><br/>Harrison and Neeson are everything but hateful and God-less. This is a soulful story about comrades and sacrifice being swept under the rug. The bad guys are the politicians and the military beauacracy. Sound familiar? These guys are closer to the David Hedison/Richard Basehart team that we all came to love on those pre-Sixty Minutes Sunday nights.<br/><br/>With a soulful musical score by real Russians, you can smell the borscht. You even see the  borscht in a shot of the galley. They ate pretty good in the Russian Navy. And those uniforms! Like Joan Rivers says, 'if you don't want gays in the military, stop making the uniforms so cute.""

"bix171","5","0","0","24 July 2002"," A Disappointing Effort From A Fine Director
","Though it's set up as Harrison Ford's own `Thirteen Days' and though Kathryn Bigelow is one of our finest action directors, there isn't a whole lot of tension mounted in this true but predictable tale of a Soviet nuclear submarine in such distress it could trigger a war. Whereas `Thirteen Days' had an immediacy that transcended its historical premise, and irregardless of the fact that this film is told entirely from a Russian point of view, this is a good example of Hollywood stuck in cold war-Soviet bashing, with the communist state portrayed as narrow-minded, careless and under-equipped and if a nuclear war were to erupt, well, it would be their fault. There isn't much moral shading in Christopher Kyle's standardized screenplay and though Ford does play most of the film as a by-the-book captain devoted more to the state than his endangered crew, when push comes to shove he easily slips back into the stoic, colorless hero mode that he has indulged in since `Air Force One'. Bigelow's points of reference run less to `Thirteen Days' (itself a very fine model of taut historical action) than to `Titanic' (some of the initial shots of the submarine in dry-dock recall the initial shots of the Titanic at port and it even has its own happy proletariat dancing and drinking sequence) and `Apollo 13' (with its digitized tracking shots into the heart of a nuclear reactor and its makeshift problem-solving) but there's little of the personal involvement that made `Point Break', `Blue Steel' and the flawed `Strange Days' so compelling. Walter Murch is the film's editor but he's probably got quite a bit to do with the film's excellent sound design."

","Trying to keep up in the arms race, the Soviet Union hastily launches its first nuclear sub on a  mission to fire a test ballistic missile, thus demonstrating its own cutting edge capabilities  to the Americans.  Haste, however, makes waste, and, that demonstration's having been achieved, one of the on board reactors springs a leak and overheats, threatening an explosion bigger than that at Hiroshima.<br/><br/>Prior to launch, the boat's captain, Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson), is bounced down to executive officer.  He sees himself as a father figure with respect to those under his command, and sees  them as his family.  The powers that be figure he needs to be replaced as captain by someone with a more demanding management style, namely one Alexi Vostrikov (Harrison Ford). Vostrikov drives Polenin's ""family"" mercilessly, welding them into a ""crew"".  Unfortunately, he was a much better welder than those who built the boat.<br/><br/>
A submarine movie is guaranteed drama, so it all becomes a matter of execution, and director Kathryn Bigelow keeps our attention submerged in the action for--whoa!--two hours and eighteen minutes.  That's ok, it moves right along.  Some of the dialogue gets a little sententious, but hey, these are Russian Commies, so you have to expect that.<br/><br/>The boat (they call submarines ""boats"", because they're not built to ship things--otherwise, they'd be called ""ships"") was doomed right from the laying of the keel  (so maybe they don't have keels...you know what I mean). Several workers lost their lives during its construction, and the champagne bottle didn't break at the Christening (or whatever Communists do to boats on their maiden voyage).  Personally, I myself even felt a little nervous on seeing that the bow appeared to be reinforced with Duct Tape, so I can imagine how the crew--er, family--felt when initially heading down the hatch, so to speak.  The K-19 promised to be a K-9.<br/><br/>Actually, she was built pretty well, except for some pipe welds in reactor three.  And her design had leap-frogged that of the Americans, who at that time had basically put reactors in converted conventional subs.  The real problem was that haste and a little too much of that Russian ""can do"" attitude had put her out to sea ill-equipped.  No backup systems for the reactors and, worse,  no radiation resistant suits.  Instead, she had been outfitted with protective suits designed for working around dangerous chemicals, little comfort when you're trying to weld the holes shut in a live runaway nuclear reactor.<br/><br/>All in all, a gripping drama.  Well cast--Ford and Neeson play well off of each other, and Peter Sarsgaard (""Boys Don't Cry"",  ""Another Day in Paradise"") adds another solid  performance to his resumé.  Director Bigelow keeps it light enough on the Russian accents so as not to be distracting. Not quite as taut a movie as ""Das Boot"", but my favorite submarine movie next to that one.  And it reveals, finally and definitively, why the Soviet Union lost the Cold War.  They spent way-y-y- too much on their uniforms."

","I liked this movie.  I did have a nitpick though, I don't like nor see the need for the foolish russian accented english most of the actors used. Either speak Russian and subtitle it for me (not going to happen with a Hollywood movie) or speak just english.  Adding a poorly done accent as if the characters spoke english with bad accents back in the day in the Motherland is not adding much in the way of atmosphere.  I think the movies that have handled foreign settings best run it in the native tongue of the setting, then have a sort of magical transition into english as if the audience has just gained fluency in the language and now doesn't notice that it's listening to a movie in another language other than english.  I think u571 handled the german that way.<br/><br/>Over all the movie is fine, what big hearts those guys had who went into the reactor space to save their crew and their ship.

Don't get me wrong, though, it's a good one.<br/><br/>The acting and effects were very convincing.  It's funny that the story seemed unrealistic to me, since it's based on actual events.  Harrison Ford surprised me by not acting like the resourceful reluctant hero that he seems to have been typecast into.  This movie gave him a somewhat original role. Liam Neeson gave about the same level and style of performance that he always does.<br/><br/>It's similar in feel to U-571, but with some major differences.  K-19 is not really a war movie, it's a historical disaster movie.  K-19 is based more tightly on actual events.  K-19 had, in my opinion, more realistic actors. The similarities are look and feel.  (Of course, both are set in submarines.)  Instead of a climax, the movies were non-stop action.  They both give a sort of team-spirit feeling; making viewers think what they would do/be able to in the same situation.)<br/><br/>I highly recommend seeing this movie while it's in the theatre, since it's a totally immersing film; it will be hard to stay grounded."
"Buddy-51","Null","0","0","22 July 2002"," excellent submarine saga
","`K-19: The Widowmaker' is a superb Cold War submarine saga, brilliantly directed by Kathryn Bigelow and featuring solid performances by a first-rate cast.  Based on a true story that occurred in 1961, but which only came to light in the West after the fall of the Soviet Union, `K-19' shows how close the world came to experiencing a nuclear explosion thanks to rank Soviet incompetence.  `K-19' was the pride of the Russian navy, a nuclear-powered sub that the leaders felt would help the Soviets achieve parity with the United States in the escalating arms race occurring at that time.   But on the boat's maiden voyage things managed to go terribly wrong, thanks mostly to the gross ineptitude of the leaders in charge of building and equipping the boat.   Poorly made, inadequately supplied and lacking the necessary back up plans in case of a dire emergency, the sub set out on its mission with not one but two captains aboard, Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) and Alexi Vostrikov (Harrison Ford), the latter sent in by the Soviet higher-ups to take over the mission after questions arose as to the ability of Polenin to handle such a crucially important mission.  Much of the tension in the film arises from the conflict that develops between the humanitarian instincts of Polenin and the hard-nosed, almost maniacally rigid Vostrikov who seems almost willing to sacrifice the lives of his men rather than to admit defeat of any kind.<br/><br/>Working off the screenplay by Christopher Kyle, director Bigalow minimizes the clichés usually associated with films set aboard submarines and concentrates instead on the human drama at the story's core.  Sure we have the obligatory scene wherein the obsessed captain, wanting to push both the boat and the crew to their respective limits, ends up ordering that the sub be taken down to near-crush level.  But that scene is kept very short and comprises only a very small part of the whole drama.  Of much greater interest to the filmmakers  and to the audience   is the way in which the men react to a crisis of almost unimaginable proportions.  When the core nuclear reactor gives way and the men are faced with the threat of death through radiation poisoning, the film becomes both a gripping suspense drama and a poignant study of fear, duty and heroism.  Bigalow keeps the tension high throughout by recording not only the fascinating details of the reactor disaster itself, but also the clash that develops between the two captains as they struggle for power and try to weigh the lives of the men against the importance of the mission and the patriotic call to duty. <br/><br/>
Technically, the film does a superb job keeping focused on the intense drama of the situation.  With superb editing and sound effects, the film makes us sense what life must really be like aboard that sub.  Bigalow effectively uses the moving camera techniques pioneered by Wolfgang Peterson in `Das Boot' to help keep the action flowing.  She is also blessed with a fine cast including Ford and Neeson who play off each other brilliantly, both actors showing the same stubbornness and humanity that define each of their characters, even though they seem to be at loggerheads during much of the time.  Peter Sarsgaard is also excellent as the inexperienced crewmember who struggles with his own conflict between fear and duty, heroism and cowardice. <br/><br/>Though the film does become a bit heavy-handed and sentimental in its closing stretches, `K-19' is, over all, one of the more intelligent action movies of the past several years.  It also happens to be the best submarine picture since the classic `Das Boot.'"

","K-19 is, at once, both worthy and betraying of the National Geographic brand it bears. On the one hand, some scenes unfold with excruciating detail. Early on, we see no fewer than five drills ordered by the Captain and played out by the crew, and the director disproportionately treats these with the suspense of a Jerry Bruckheimer climax or, appropriately enough, a National Geographic WWII feature. On the other hand, these very details reek of ""poetic license"" and downright falsehood. Too many military cliches arise over the course of K-19 for the dialogue to be within a respectable distance of accurate. It is in essence a blockbuster the way National Geographic pedants would make one.<br/><br/>That said, much was impressive about the script and the performances. The whole idea of Soviet patriotism expressed so earnestly is novel to me (I never saw Enemy at the Gates), but wholly believable and imparting on the crew. It added a bizarro-American feel to the Soviets, and helped the audience relate to their idealism, their novice, and their youthful energy. The prominence of politics, both informal between Ford and Neeson and formal through the Kommisar, also added a dimension not explored by many submarine films. Ford is excellent, but Neeson comes across as too one-dimensional, and I think this is the script's fault. While I can empathize with the weight of the pressure on Ford's character, Neeson's role requires little more than the cliched ""stick up for the crew in front of the captain"" attitude. We never learn much about Neeson's past, and his grand turning point happens with less than twenty minutes left in the film and nary a satisfying explanation for his actions. Ford, on the other hand, is unusually cold, calculating, but motivation by a inner warmth that he hints at only occasionally in this film. I wouldn't say he carried the picture, but it's one of his best performances. The crew was also well-portrayed and, barring the episodic Russian accents, could have been a crew on an American submarine. I think this casting vision was intentional, so that we could see just how universal the fears of submarine warfare really are. Whether this choice was accurate or not... well, I wasn't there.<br/><br/>The plot is obviously an event the National Geographic scholars found fascinating, but which doesn't translate well onto celluloid. Cursed omens? Repetitive drills? Core meltdowns? This might as well have been called ""Cold War Submarines 101,"" a survey movie that spices up dry subject matter to convince the populace to run over to their local library and read about the Scorpion, the Kursk, or, at the very least, read Hunt for Red October. I love naval history, but if the groans and sighs around me were any indication, I was near alone in that theatre.<br/><br/>My advice? See it if you appreciate Harrison Ford as more than a fine piece of meat. See it if you're in the mood for a good docudrama. See it if you love submarine movies. See it if you like guy bonding movies. But don't expect an exceptional history lesson or an edge-of-your-seat thriller. Expect a flawed but decent film that despite its short comings manages to instill a nice balance of intellect, emotion, and entertainment."

Liam Neeson is his executive officer, devoted to the goodwill and survival of his men. The conflict is predictable; what is not easy to discern, however, is who is right or wrong.

I served aboard American submarines in the 1960's and 1970's and I still have trouble not thinking of them as an enemy. On top of that I knew the entire real story of K19. I was a design engineer for the Department of Defense for many years and ended my career in a department for US submarine design. I felt, what more could I learn enough to make it worth the price of a ticket? I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson did admirably well, even if their accents weren't always perfect (why bother with accents anyway in situations when real characters would not have been speaking English?). But I was far more impressed - and entertained - by the phalanx of unknown actors making up the remainder of the cast. They were marvelous and gave a heightened sense of realism just because their faces weren't familiar. Sam Spruell was especially touching as Dimitri. That it is his first work is a real treat to see. But the rest, Peter Stebbins, Christian Camargo, Roman Podhora, Ravil Issyanov and Dmitry Chepovetsky; where did they find these wonderful actors? Great casting overall ...<br/><br/>The submarine environment was recreated with a nice feel for a foreign boat and the methods and problems those men faced were compelling, even to this very experienced high-tech expert. I loved the sets and costumes, it was very well staged, even down to the correct color handles on the Makarov's. I appreciated that the film makers cared enough to create this much realism for my enjoyment. I was kind of surprised, too, that the director was a woman. Usually this much action - especially military - is the sole province of men. But Kathryn Bigelow did a wonderful job, perhaps because there was more emotional tension and suspense than in the usual action offering.<br/><br/>The other stellar ingredient for me was the wonderful selection of locations. Most were in Canada, but some was done in Russia, I see. It all looked so great.<br/><br/>I will not discuss the actual subject of the movie. I wouldn't want to spoil it. One can find a documentary or two on the subject for more information. This is a more passionate telling of it though. It is a well thought out version of the actual events and does much to make my former enemy look human. I appreciate the effect. The story's largest lesson is that heroism can be found anywhere and the effect on those around it are universal."
"mrow","9","0","0","21 July 2002"," A far more plausible ""Red October""
","I found a world of difference between the more plausible rush-to-launch K-19 and the finely-honed state-of-the-art Red October in the fictional Clancy novel/screenplay.  It's Das Boot, updated and with a Soviet bent. I felt there were excellent performances by all concerned; I could not find fault with any of them, nor with the direction. Some of the cinematography was downright clever, helped along I suppose by newer, lighter camera designs. However, digital water abounds.   <br/><br/>Nicely made, but it would have benefitted (sorry, just my opinion) from a more prominent mainstream composer like Horner or Zimmer.  But the Klaus Badelt score works acceptably well, if slightly aimless in the early scenes. Few would have noticed, but the Soviet National Anthem is conspicuously missing (there was a scene where it definitely should have played, at the launching of K-19) and I am wondering about some sort of political disagreement with regard to a sign-off on that. The title music is patterned after the anthem, and most likely that is no accident.  I did not realize permission was required to use an anthem, so am quite curious as to the nature of the back story. I cannot think of a good reason why the melody would not have been used. <br/><br/>This is a suspenseful film which I feel finds balance in most if not all aspects of the storytelling. Factual, but ""some of the names were changed to protect the innocent"" sort-of-thing.  Certainly there will be disagreement, as the subject matter is so charged with political issues and personal feelings. The portrayal of this incident fits well with all that I know of the facts so far, and of the Soviet military and economic system in general and the politics of the day. Years ago, scenes could not easily be filmed in Russia. That has changed, and the result is refreshing. One of the best films I've seen this year."

","When I heard about K-19: The Widowmaker, I wasn't even sure what to think about it.  Part of me went, ""Oh, another submarine movie...We've seen it all before.""  I did notice that Harrison Ford had turned down working in Christopher Nolan's version of ""Insomnia"" and wondered...there must have been something about K-19 to turn down another great acting opportunity.<br/><br/>Then I thought about Harrison Ford doing a Russian accent, and the questions rose again.  ""Do I really want to spend $10 on this?""<br/><br/>Even after my decision was made, while buying the ticket, I couldn't have been that excited because I wasn't even sure if I said the films' name correctly when at the ticket booth.  Then came some of the opening moments where I had to accept Ford and other's not-so-wonderful Russian accents but that was the end to my questioning.<br/><br/>Frankly, I am beside myself over the criticisms I have read from critics who think this is an ""average"" film.  The word misunderstood, is actually an overwhelming understatement, because I took K-19 to be one of the most powerful pieces of film making I have seen in quite some time.<br/><br/>One of the earlier comments I read here by Ignacio Martinez-Ybor (imyjr@attbi.com) expressed nearly identical sentiments I felt about the movie.<br/><br/>
The comparisons to ""The Hunt for Red October,"" and co. seem to possess little validity, in my view.  This is NOT an action based thriller in the same conventional way that these other movies were.  It is REAL LIFE DRAMA, that digs deep into the soul of what it is like to be a human being facing choices that we wish we would neve have to make.  I do not think I could not possibly commend Kathryn Bigelow's direction enough here.  This is a REAL and REFRESHING FEMININE TAKE on war and being human.  Her understanding of this transcends nearly all of the submarine and war films (with a few exceptions) that come to mind.  <br/><br/>There are some Hollywood movies that have attempted to deal with this subject matter before, not simply one's about war either, but they all somehow seem to cop out and turn real grit into some mushy nonsense (whether it be patriotism, or overly romantic) that isn't believable.  K-19 had a few moments here and there, particularly the end, that suffered from this syndrome, but the predominant message was too strong to be lost in (what was likely) some producers' addition to Bigelow's final piece.<br/><br/>I would also be remised to not mention the fact that the characters who we learn to care about are members of the Soviet Navy...THE MORTAL ENEMY, to many Americans barely a decade ago.  This was part of ""The Hunt For Red October"" as well, but the intentions of the Sub in this movie, was MUCH different than that Sean Connery was running.  There really is no clear cut over-the-top enemy character here (normally a staple of Hollywood dramas) so we have to think of other potential enemies on our own, although plenty of subtle hints, this I found to be QUITE pleasant.<br/><br/>The acting, outside of the accents, was overall of high quality.  Ford and Neeson are magnificent in their emotional depiction and the supporting cast, of mostly unknowns, was also quite good.  We really care about these characters and we HAVE TO in this movie.  Credit must go to Ms. Bigelow as well here for this.<br/><br/>Overall, K-19 goes as one of my best films of the year and something I hope does not remain overlooked due to critics and film goers expecting something else.  I have a feeling this could be a word-of-mouth winner over time.  Be warned though, there is some painful material here to deal with but in the end it makes it all the more gratifying.  <br/><br/>Highly Recommended."

","The best thing about Das Boot, a very suspenseful film, is that in the end all of Hitler's henchmen are killed. That film lies in trying to paint the German submariners as anti-Nazi; in fact the submarine service was the most Nazi of them all, except perhaps for the SS units. In K-19, we don't have the satisfaction of seeing the deaths of all of the henchmen of Stalin, the most vicious mass murderer of them all. Instead we have praise of the ""patriotism"" of these henchmen and the absolute lie that they saved the world from a nuclear war by preventing the (impossible) detonation of the nuclear warheads aboard the sub. In sum, a truly disgusting and traitorous paen to our country's vicious enemies."

In the struggle for world nuclear supremacy, the (then) Soviet Union rushes to beat the US in the nuclear arms race.<br/><br/>I won't detail the story as so many already have, but this is pretty compelling even in the slowest times, although there are an unfortunate number of those slow times. The principals herein carry off the accents well enough, although the overall feeling this story should have conveyed does not manifest itself until near the final act.<br/><br/>All in all? This film is not for Friday or Saturday night viewing. This would serve better as an educational demonstration of Cold War attitudes, practices, and principles. For us, it felt more like a history lesson than entertainment.<br/><br/>This wasn't fun and the drama doesn't work its way into suspense until just before the end, regardless of the sheer volume of the score.

"filipemanuelneto","6","1","2","9 February 2019"," An invented story that obscures the real facts, in a film that, nevertheless, knows how to entertain the audience.
","This film is very slightly based on a real fact, which was the fateful maiden voyage of the nuclear submarine K19, one of the first nuclear ballistic submarines of the Soviet Union. Built in haste, he had several accidents and deaths before he was thrown into the sea. On the maiden voyage, the ship suffers a loss of coolant that controlled the temperature of the nuclear reactor, which forced the crew to risk their lives for emergency repairs on the high sea, preventing the reactor from collapsing. Most of the crew died of the effects of radiation in the following years. The survivors, however, still preserve their memory today.<br/><br/>The film was an insult to the memory of the K19 sailors, a fact emphasized by the surviving sailors, in a unanimous protest. Eager to make the film more appealing, and always under ""creative freedom"" arguments, the director Kathryn Bigelow allowed the whole story to be rewritten and told in a completely different way from the real facts. So it's a work of fiction, cloaked under the ""true facts"" that the film never really take advantage of. After all, the movie is very good from the entertainment point of view. It's not a movie that we get tired of seeing and reviewing, once in a while. This, coupled with a good commercial performance, has opened the doors of television, where it's still a regular, both in general channels and in channels specifically dedicated to the exhibition of films.<br/><br/>The film can be divided into two parts. The first one tries to be an introduction to the film, presenting the characters, the environment, the submarine, the life on board and the mission that they must accomplish. The second part is the realization of the accident and the unwinding of attempts to repair the submarine, with increasing tension around the subject. The biggest problem I've felt is the exaggerated prolongation of the first half of the movie. It was not really necessary to attend so many exercises. The whole sub-plot involving the insubordination of the sailors assigned to the First Officer, who was the previous commander of that crew, is also expendable.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is an excellent actor and makes, in this film, one of his most interesting works, for me. The actor did an excellent job, giving life and psychological depth to a deep and complex character. At his side we see Liam Neeson, also one of the best-executed works of his career. The way the two perform together is excellent, and some of the film's best dialogues run between them. The remaining cast complies with their work, but does not deserve attention.<br/><br/>Technically, the film does not make big mistakes. The submarine's interior looks genuine enough, the cinematography, light and sound do their job discreetly, the soundtrack does not deserve great remarks.<br/><br/>It's an interesting and entertaining film, but tells a new story, invented over a real one, that remains to be told. The uneven pace does not help either, but if you really like submarine movies, you will not even feel the time go by."
"imdb-45","5","1","2","6 May 2017"," Mediocre film, a sub story done Hollywood style
","I wanted to like this film. Sadly it got off to a bad start when all the actors decided to play fast and loose or not at all with their Russian accent. It was as if they tried to do something at the beginning and then said ""aw... screw it. we aren't fooling anyone"" and then dropped the accent entirely most of the time. You can put it behind you eventually but it's a sign about how sloppy this film is made.<br/><br/>The premise is that Ford's character is a bit of a bully who will take out of proportion risks and endanger the lives of everyone on board to prove his point. I did not see any resolution between Ford and Neeson's character. And in terms of what plays out that I won't say - I never saw it coming. And that's only because where the film went was not what the prior time led you to believe. In fact, everything pointed in the other direction until it felt like Hollywood stepped in because the script said ""insert turning point here"" and then the characters had to pretend as if this was the natural next sequence of events. It wasn't.<br/><br/>The special effects are fine and the submarine shots reasonably good. But the repair involved was also ridiculous. It was as almost as if they ran out of budget and would show you the same thing, with everyone having a go at what they were fixing which seemed more like ""designated piece of metal"". OK, we'll get beyond that but it still bears notice as you watch repeated scenes of the same thing as if to convey a sense of emotional impact on certain characters - which I didn't find credible.<br/><br/>This is nowhere near Das Boot to feel the tension. And it's not really meant to be. And as a ""based on a true story"" it's very, very lightly based on the true story. Most of the acting is fine but the script is a real problem. And I don't think Harrison Ford would have himself cast as anything else but smelling like roses. And that's also disappointing. At no point do I think the conclusion of this film is even remotely foreseeable because the natural flow of the characters and events simply doesn't get you there. It's done solely to keep the audience guessing what happens next and the very artificial Hollywood studios twist makes for a mediocre, phony feeling film that certainly would only stand up for one viewing, at best."

","Let me start by saying I loved this film. I believe Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford were excellent as Russian captains. The movie takes place in 1961, the Russians have a new nuclear submarine. Before it leaves it is to be christened. Once the champagne bottle is released, it fails to break. All the men of K-19 were shocked. This is usually a bad sign. The crew continues to get prepared to leave. Before leaving there is an accident involving a crew member, and one of the crew has to be replaced due to being drunk on duty. The crew led by Capt. Alexei Vostrikov( Harrison Ford), and Mikhail Polenin(Liam Neeson). During this time it is the height of the Cold War. K-19 is heading toward American waters. It seems all is going well until Lt. Vadim Radtchinko(Peter Sarsgaard) notices the temperature start to rise outside the nuclear reactor room. The controls signify there is a small leak starting in the reactor room. Radtchinko relays this to Polenin, and Vostrikov. The crew must stop it before a disaster like Hiroshima happens. Polenin decides the men must work in shifts, but it keeps getting worse. When going to get the proper equipment the sub only has chemical suits, no radiation suits. The situation gets worse the men know they are doomed, but they must control the leak for a chance of survival. The men go in two's, 10 minutes max in the reactor room. They continue this until the leak is somewhat controlled. All the men take their turn except the Lt.(Sarsgaard) he freezes which doesn't look good, the men, and Polenin are disappointed. They do get the leak slowed down, and it holds for awhile, but eventually it begins again. This time it is worse, and Radtchinko vows not to let the Captains or the men down. He goes in, and tries to control it himself. The crew is hot, suffering from radiation sickness; and the readings are off the chart. Thus begins the waiting game until help can arrive. Once K-19 reaches American waters, The U.S. Navy offers assistance, but Vostrikov refuses. Making the men and Polenin wonder why. Vostrikov says he will not turn his back on Mother Russia, he will not be guilty of treason. The crew is suffering, they arrest Vostrikov and make Polenin lead captain. Polenin at first looks as if he will take this honor, but instead backs his captain. Polenin releases Vostrikov, and those that try to stage the munity I believe are arrested.. This is where I feel Vostrikov is suffering from radiation sickness, and Polenin is probably in the beginning stages. The men are dying, and almost all of them have high radiation levels. From this point the leak gets worse most men are too sick to work in shifts, and the radiation levels keep rising. Vostrikov suffering from radiation sickness, realizes he needs to get his men off this sub ASAP. He calls Moscow, but the request gets denied. He tells Polenin he wants them off ASAP. Polenin reminds him it would mean the end of his military career for in subornation. At this point Vostrikov doesn't care, in awhile another sub comes; and helps rescue the men. The men are decontaminated, and taken aboard. After the rescue Polenin, and Vostrikov get checked at the hospital along with their crew. Once they are able, a trial for in subornation begins. The damage is done, a lot of the men aboard the K-19 eventually end up losing their lives which Vostrikov and Polenin will live with forever.<br/><br/>This story is based on a true story, and for 28 years the survivors could not tell their story until the fall of Communism in Russia. I really liked this film; and though I am a huge Neeson/ Ford fan; it was the story that draws you in. The bravery, and sacrifice the crew went through, for the love of their Country was amazing. This film is action packed, from the beginning to the end. A story the world got to know, and the lessons learned from it.<br/><br/>THX, Kris L. CocKayne"

The movie is good because it relates what happened, and it does it so well.

Moreover the main cast in their characters look like too many known American movies.<br/><br/>What's not pleasant in this movie, it's the constant melodramatic soundtrack.

","""K-19: The Widowmaker"" is a true story about the USSR's first nuclear ballistic submarine. On its first voyage, the nuclear reactor malfunctions, and the crew risks their lives attempting to fix it by exposing themselves to dangerous levels of radiation. If the situation can't be repaired, they risk not only a nuclear disaster of epic proportions but a world war.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford is the strict Captain Alexei Vostrikov, who puts his crew through endless drills so that they can build camaraderie and a sense of achievement. Unfortunately, the sub is not equipped for any kind of nuclear problem -- they have chemical suits instead of radiation suits (not available until later), and as the second in command (Liam Neeson) says, they might as well be wearing raincoats.<br/><br/>This is the most devastating part of the film. The men can only enter the site of the problem for ten minutes at a time, and it's enough to nearly burn them alive. The sub becomes more and more dangerously radioactive, to the point where they will need to abandon ship. The nearby Americans offer to help, but Vostrikov's patriotism and fear that the Americans may learn Soviet secrets causes him to refuse.<br/><br/>There are some really excellent moments in this film as well as some fine performances from Ford, Neeson, and the rest of the cast, and it is well directed by Kathryn Bigelow.<br/><br/>I see a lot of the reviews deal with accents, so I'll put in my two cents. Yes, it's true, Ford just lost his mid-film and picked it up again later. The rule for actors is that if people are speaking their native language, which naturally these Russians were, no accent is necessary. A good example of this is the film ""The Mortal Storm."" Otherwise, of course, Chekov would be done with accents, French farces would be done with accents, etc., and they aren't. And yes, it's okay to talk about kopecks with an American accent as we understand that they are speaking Russian. You need an accent if you are playing a foreigner speaking English, so accents were not needed here.

"briszmon","9","1","2","20 November 2011"," An Extremely Fine Misunderstood Film
","This is a neglected almost-classic. It's a taut tale, of course, but one which quite transcends its subject matter -- which is not at all what most people think it is, a mere tale of survival. It is far, far more. While the mechanics of failed hardware are engrossingly well done and the issues of bravery and self-sacrifice are also treated with nice passion, still, almost every commentator has missed what is really going on. The greatest reason the movie is misunderstood is the difficulty for most of us in seeing Soviet era military except through the lens of we-good/they-bad. (I should interpolate here that personally I am quite pro-American. I still argue the necessity of the Vietnam war.) With such thinking it's impossible to comprehend the behind the scenes of the characters. In societies -- even those with which we are fated to compete with violence for our own good -- there are patriots and idealists who believe in their homeland, their cause, and in many cases their government. What this story treats, is the tragedy of a loss of innocence, of a sense, in one such individual from one such society, that what was revered in the system he was brought up to believe in as a mainstay may be inferior, weak and in many places even rotten and destructive -- and not only through direct immoral human agency but because of historic failure, an inability to sustain itself on the field of direct competition as a strong contender. Seen this way, this story becomes extraordinarily meaningful and poignant."
"classicsoncall","8","1","2","15 October 2011"," ""We shall be a ghost ship"".
","There's something about submarine movies, the claustrophobic feel that hints at certain doom if conditions go awry, that make them interesting and compelling. Probably the best of the genre is the German film ""Das Boot"" offering a look at a naval disaster in the offing from the enemy point of view. ""K-19"" is of similar bent, and just as in ""Das Boot"", the viewer may find himself secretly cheering for the bad guys to find a way out of peril. Yet they're bad only by accident of nationality, following orders of supreme commanders who consider human life throwaway in service to the Fatherland.<br/><br/>Based on actual events as recent as 1961, I see that other reviewers who have knowledge of the historical K-19 found it to be more fiction than fact. Putting that aside, I still found the story to be a gripping drama once it became apparent that the crippled sub could be saved only at the expense of ultimate human sacrifice. That there are such men who find their duty to their fellows, their comrades, and not their nation is what becomes inspirational with effective story telling.<br/><br/>If you're used to seeing Harrison Ford as Han Solo or Indiana Jones, his characterization here as the Russian naval captain may startle you with it's bluntness and lack of compassion. As the hard driving commander, he rides herd on his crew to perform in drill after relentless drill, subliminally preparing them for the disaster that will eventually befall the ship. As the XO, Liam Neeson's Mikhail Polenin is the sympathetic executive officer the crew can relate to, thereby setting up a clever twist when Polenin refuses to take part in the mutiny. The idea that Vostrikov would have sacrificed the crew to avoid triggering a world war was an element that added unexpected nuance to the story.<br/><br/>My main takeaway from the picture is an idea I've had all along about the way peoples of different nations can live peacefully together if simply left to their own devices. Good war films project that message, it's the men at the top calling the shots for their own motives who make life miserable for the rest. Taken to it's extreme, competing goals of world domination point the way to mutually assured destruction."
"randallcameron","7","1","2","28 February 2007"," Gripping story!
","We enjoyed this movie. The best parts are the true story elements, solid characterizations by the principal actors, and the fair depiction of the heroism, dedication and loyalty of Soviet officers and sailors sent out in a badly designed boat, a product of the drive to quickly catch up with the US' early lead in nuclear subs. BTW, the USSR's first four nuclear boats all experienced reactor accidents; all four boats survived with heavy losses of life in situations where an American crew would have abandoned and scuttled the boat. K-19 was only retired in 1991, 18 years after the last of three unrelated major onboard accidents, a tribute to the USSR ""equipment before men"" approach.<br/><br/>What we did not like were the Hollywood additions to a terrific true story: (SPOILERS AHEAD!) reactors never explode, they melt down, which is more than catastrophic enough; the mutiny was unbelievable and unnecessary (Capt. Polyenin's unexpected response somewhat redeemed this); and no sub captain would make a hot-dog deep dive and rapid surfacing in an untested boat, endangering his mission, boat, and crew.<br/><br/>However, that is a few minutes rubbish in an otherwise very interesting film. You could nitpick about phony accents, various technical details, or Harrison Ford's limited range of facial expressions.<br/><br/>You really feel for these ""cold warriors"" doing their duty, making the ultimate sacrifice and dying horrible deaths for the safety of their country. With such men, it is easy to see why Russia would be a tough opponent on a battlefield.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing once."

","One of the most traumatic scenes in cinema history: The sailor waiting to spend his 10 minutes in the reactor, sees the condition of the first pair sent in to repair the reactor cooling system... with inadequate tools and clothing, the sailor collapses in fear and dread, knowing that it is his turn next. <br/><br/>It's almost a shame to have Harrison Ford in the movie because it becomes a star driven movie but I guess it would not have been made without a big name. <br/><br/>Despite the Hollywoodisation of the true story, this is a deeply moving and involving story. And cramped! The photography conveys the claustrophobia of the submarine - the Russian technology looks like they are floating in a scrap heap making you believe and understand the dangers of the experimental nuclear submarine, rushed into trials for purely political reasons.

Although my interests in submarines relate almost entirely to the U.S., I'm going to purchase this one. I have been out on several types of U.S. submarines and spent several years helping to building nuclear boats. The interior scenes of K-19 are superb. I've never seen a U.S. submarine film with interiors as accurate as this one, even if the nuclear reactor depicted wasn't for real. The acting was outstanding and the photography was outstanding. I'm sure there were technical errors related to the equipment and the history of the event, but I don't really care, and this is very unusual for me."
"JamesHitchcock","7","1","2","5 April 2006"," A Reproach to the Soviet System, not a Vindication of it
","Throughout his career Harrison Ford has tended to play heroes rather than villains, a notable exception being the adulterous, murderous husband in ""What Lies Beneath"". This was his first film after that one, and for much of the film he seems to be continuing his attempt to broaden his range by playing unsympathetic characters. It is set on board K19, the Soviet Union's first nuclear powered submarine, in 1961, during the Cold War. Ford plays its commander, Captain Alexei Vostrikov, given the position after his predecessor, Mikhail Polenin, was demoted for putting the safety of his crew before the interests of the Communist Party. Polenin remains on board as second-in-command, making for a tense and difficult relationship between the two.<br/><br/>Vostrikov suffers from two disadvantages. The Soviet authorities do not entirely trust him because his father was regarded as politically unreliable and ended his days in a gulag. The crew, still in their hearts loyal to Polenin, do not trust Vostrikov either, partly because he is a strict disciplinarian and partly because rumour has it that he only got the job because of family connections to a Politburo member. The ship is ordered to sail under the Arctic ice-cap to test-fire a missile, then to go on patrol off the East Coast of America. Disaster strikes when the nuclear reactor malfunctions; although the fault is repaired, the crew are exposed to dangerous levels of radiation. Vostrikov refuses assistance from a passing American destroyer, but as radiation levels continue to increase, many of the crew become convinced that their only chance is to make for the NATO base on Jan Mayen Island or to abandon ship and accept the destroyer's help. Vostrikov indignantly refuses to consider any action that would involve handing his ship over to Russia's enemies and insists that they should attempt to return to base. Even the political officer, charged with maintaining ideological purity, wants to turn the submarine over to the Americans and attempts to lead a mutiny against Vostrikov. Polenin must now decide where his loyalties lie.<br/><br/>Previously, Vostrikov has seemed a fanatical nationalist, more concerned with ostentatiously demonstrating his loyalty to the Party than with the safety of his crew. There has, however, been one small clue which suggests that he is far from being a loyal Communist. When his men are trying to repair the damaged reactor, he wishes them ""God be with you!"" In an American or British ship such a remark would have been a banal commonplace; in the radically atheistic Soviet Union, any mention of God was a subversive political comment. It is at this point that we learn the real reasons why he does not want to abandon his ship; if he does, the reactor may explode, destroying not only the American ship but also the NATO base, leading to a risk of American retaliation and of nuclear war between the superpowers.<br/><br/>Vostrikov therefore turns out to be a typical Harrison Ford character after all, a man of great courage and determination trying to do the right thing and to prevent disaster. The film has many similarities with another submarine drama from a few years earlier, ""The Crimson Tide"". That film was set on board an American vessel rather than a Russian one, but it also had at its heart a conflict of personalities between a conservative captain and a liberal second-in-command, and also featured an attempted mutiny. Both films made good use of the enclosed, claustrophobic atmosphere of a submarine. In both cases there are very good performances from two contrasting actors playing the two contrasting officers. In the earlier film Gene Hackman played the pugnacious, explosive Captain Ramsey and Denzel Washington the calmer, more thoughtful Lieutenant-Commander Hunter. Here it is Liam Neeson's more liberal Polenin who is also the more emotional of the two; Vostrikov, like many Ford characters, is played with a calm, solid imperturbability.<br/><br/>This is not, as some have claimed, a pro-Communist movie. (Trying to make pro-Soviet propaganda in 2002, ten years after the Soviet Union collapsed, would have been a forlorn hope indeed). Certainly, it is unlikely that such a film would have been made during the Cold War itself, when anything showing Russian sailors in a heroic light would not have been well received in America (or, for that matter, in many Western European countries). Today, however, we are able to look at the events of the Cold War in a more objective, historical way.<br/><br/>One of the things that has now become clear about the period is what a ramshackle, disorganised place Soviet Russia was, although at the time this view would have been fiercely contested not only by the Left, which clung to the illusion that it was a workers' paradise, but also by the Right, which clung equally firmly to its belief that it was a ruthlessly efficient and disciplined state. Although Khrushchev introduced a partial internal liberalisation after Stalin's death, internationally his regime was still obsessed, for reasons of pride and ideological zeal, with matching and even exceeding America's defence spending, even though the Soviet economy was only a small fraction of the size of the American one. The sailors in this film are victims of that obsession and of a government that values its own prestige more highly than their lives. In order to fulfil that government's dream of possessing its own nuclear submarine force, they are sent to sea in a hastily-built, badly designed vessel with an unsafe reactor, without even protective suits against the dangers of radiation. Their courage and self-sacrifice stand as a reproach to the Soviet system, not as a vindication of it. 7/10"

I don't know, all I know is it's a very good film and you should give it a try just like I did. You won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Or to paraphrase a line from the film (in regards to its critics): ""Who needs honors from men like that?"""
"bijin_chick","6","1","2","2 May 2005"," K-19: The Widowmaker could have been so much more. Still, it's a respectable effort.
","Watching ""K-19: The Widowmaker"" was a frustrating experience. Despite some extremely chilling moments, a neat look at propaganda and concepts of loyalty, the movie drags too much to be considered a complete success. Nonetheless, it's a lot smarter than your average ""blockbuster,"" and Bigelow does succeed in capturing a sense of panicked claustrophobia (one of the hallmarks of the submarine movie, and it's done very well here).<br/><br/>Ironically, the ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" plot -- with Neeson and Ford vying for control -- is probably the least exciting part of the film, probably because we've seen it in so many other films. These are two powerful, interesting and authoritative actors, but their conflict feels stale. There's no sense of cat-and-mouse or one-upmanship; rather, it's like watching two elk butt heads. We're ready to move on a lot sooner than the film does.<br/><br/>The nuclear core meltdown plot is easily the more interesting story. If you can sit through the first act, this sequence is well worth the wait. It recalls ""The Red Badge of Courage"" in its exploration of cowardice and bravery. Peter Sarsgaard almost steals the movie as the young, untested officer suddenly confronted with the prospect of a horrible death. His reaction will probably ring far more true than most viewers would care to admit.<br/><br/>It is in these moments that K-19 flirts with greatness. Unfortunately, it's as if the screenwriter and director didn't trust the nuclear reactor story to carry the film, and added in the battle-of-the-wills subplot -- which in turn torpedoes the film, no pun intended.<br/><br/>The cast also struggles with on-and-off Russian accents, which deals another blow to the film. I wish they'd handled the language concept better because the accents are seriously distracting. The collective weakness of the accents recalls Costner in ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"" a charge it pains me to make. Nonetheless, the accents are not the worst problem of the film and you tend to forget about them by the time the great stuff starts happening in the second half.<br/><br/>As for the performances, Ford is a good presence, and I have to admire him for taking on such an atypical role for him. Vostikov is a strict taskmaster, but Ford keeps him from slipping into caricature. Neeson is a good counterpoint, with a face that seems made for humanistic characters, and his interactions with the crew bespeak a paternal tenderness (indeed, he provides much of the film's humanity). Sarsgaard, nearly unrecognizable from his roles in ""Boys Don't Cry"" and ""Garden State,"" performs yet another great disappearing act.<br/><br/>Overall, it seems the filmmakers' hearts (and minds) were in the right place, but the execution just wasn't as great as it could have been. Still, the film's got a brain and some claustrophobically intense sequences. It's worth checking out."

","K-19 The Widow Maker is a powerful, moving film about the challenges of leadership and the functioning of people as individuals and a team when under great duress. It was particularly appreciated after watching the previews of the drivel of entertainment which is to come to theaters in coming weeks. I found that it riveted my attention for its full 138 minutes and even left me watching the credits at the end. Actors Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson were superb in presenting their characters. It was refreshing for a change to see a motion picture in which I detected no unrealisms induced in order to be politically correct for our day and age.<br/><br/>My criticisms would be limited to some technical flaws with the way authors and Hollywood  often portray the functioning of the military.  I can not speak with authority on the Soviet Navy but it seems most reasonable that even under the heavy political pressure they were to put a ship to sea and have it operational in minimal time, there would still have been a detailed plan for sea trials which would start over time with minimal demand maneuvers, building up over time to pushing the envelope of maximum performance. A schedule which would be carefully planned and analyzed by engineers and designers, not at the whim of the commander.   Every critical crew member would have been briefed and trained to the routine and the expected performance of each performance and drill. Probably the engineers and designers would be on board for those tests.  It seems highly unlikely that a full missile launch drill would be conducted while the ship was still under final construction in the dry dock.  A test missile launch could not have been suddenly launched at the desire of the commanding officer without lots of preplanning, communication, watching and clearance by the authority conducting the test. The main threat of the reactor problem was presented as the possibility of a thermonuclear explosion, which just could not happen. A melt down of the reactor which would leave the sub destroyed and cause major pollution of the ocean and perhaps atmosphere, is the more likely threat.<br/><br/>Other critics have commented on Harrison Ford's accent, which I found consistent and not a problem. It has also been criticized that Americans might be turned off by the Russian patriotism displayed and the anti-American propaganda.  I personally did not find it so, but appreciated the realism which portrayed obvious love of motherland that people in every nation feel and the resentment of the attitudes and tactics of the enemy of the times as the United States was then to them. The fallacies of the Soviet system were readily apparent as well, and provided some understanding as to why the system failed.<br/><br/>This is one of the better films I have seen in recent years and rate it 9 on a scale of ten. It should be a ""must see"" for those who like military action films or the drama of how leaders respond in stressful situations to get the jobs of mission and welfare of followers worked out."

","This is the only movie I have seen this summer and it is a fantastic movie. It might appeal more to those who followed the Cold War history of the 60's and 70's before the fall of the Soviet Union but I think anyone who likes drama will enjoy this movie.  There are times you will be sitting on the edge of your seat and your stomach will tighten up.<br/><br/>As a former Air Force Intelligence Specialist it brought back memories of the Cold War to me when sometimes we stood toe to toe with the Russians on the brink of a nuclear holocaust.  However, we see this movie from the Russian side and the Americans are only a sidelight to the movie.<br/><br/>The comraderie of men in uniform, dedication to duty, a willingness to die for one's country, etc. and, in this case, engaged in a life and death true experience makes it one hell of a movie.

","Without Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson I don't think this script is strong enough to make it a good film.  But the acting is superb, and the tension between the two approaches to leadership shown by the leads is interesting enough to carry us along.  I was a little skeptical that there would be enough interest in a cold war story of a potential disaster that we all know didn't happen, but ultimately you just find yourself wondering how the individuals involved came to deal with a very difficult situation.  There is cowardice and courage -- in the same person -- and blind loyalty and instinctual rebellion in different people.  Very well done.<br/><br/>
Excellently directed, nicely filmed, and worth seeing.  I didn't think Ford could do a good Russian accent, and it does come and go now and then, but you tend not to notice after awhile.  I recommend this movie, and like its intelligence.  Thumbs up."

","This movie was an absolute disappointment as it diverged from reality, dishonored the real Soviet crew that sacrificed so much and insulted the audience by making up implausible plot twists that created a global crisis beyond the real [environmental] crisis that was actually present.  Does anyone need to be told that a nuclear meltdown does not cause a nuclear explosion?<br/><br/>Why does Hollywood time and time again think that the real story, or anything close to it, is too boring to tell?  The real K-19 story is amazing, but they did not launch any missiles, they did not patrol of the coast of the USA, they did not have two captains on board and the Americans were not involved at all.<br/><br/>Does anyone remember Apollo 13?  When you watch this movie you learn what actually happened; you feel like you lived the real event.  K-19 could have been such a story.  Some of the crew and I believe the captain are still alive today to lend insight.  We had a chance to catch a glimpse of real life on board the first Soviet nuclear sub.  Remember Das Boat?  Instead, Hollywood fed us the usual: Nuclear War!  Americans good and helpful. Russian state evil and corrupt.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes, I would have to say this is the worst acting of Harrison Ford's career.  His Russian accent was so bad even he couldn't keep it up as it ebbed and flowed.  Remember Russia House?  Michelle Pheiffer's Russian accent was so good you'd think she was named Pheifferskaya.<br/><br/>After you get over the fact that the movie has nothing to do with reality, the worst part about it was the writers inability to end the movie.  It drug on possibly 30 minutes past the conclusion of the [completely artificially created] crisis.  Perhaps it didn't seem appropriate to end the movie at the end of the crisis because so little story had been told.<br/><br/>This movie goes on the shelf next to other recent ""based on a true story"" movies, such as Wind Talkers, another complete insult to the people actually involved."

The attempted suspense scenes failed massively becuase nobody knows what the ""mission"" is.  Everything goes wrong, I mean everything.

Harrison Ford has the equivalent of the Sean Connery role, and his subtle and sensitive underplaying prooves that he could move with great ease into the pantheon of suave elder statesman, if he could escape the  ""Indiana Jones"" bravado trap once and for all. The conviction of his performance gives added depth to this based on fact account of an early sixties near disaster that could have made the Cuban Missile crisis look like Kruschev at the ""Can Can"" set.  Produced with the involvement of actual survivors of the incident (who were forced into silence for 28 years until the fall of the iron curtain), and The National Geographic Society, there is no denying the credibility of the account (even if the action is overshadowed a bit by the ""Apollo 13""...hey we know what happened curse of lack of suspense.

K-19, The Widowmaker came in behind overall weak box office numbers on it's opening weekend after the Stuart Little Sequel, the Road to Perdition and MIB.<br/><br/>OK, the title didn't help. No, it's not about a death climb on Everest or nearby peaks. And it's not about skateboards either. It's a submarine movie and a really good one too. Like the great grand pappy of all sub flicks, Run Silent Run Deep, you've got a handsome young captain who loves his crew and they love him and a grizzled new older captain who loves no one. Drill, drill, drill, dangerous mission. In the Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster roles you have Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson respectively.<br/><br/>The only drawback here is that these guys are just too darn good-looking to be Russians. And no Don Rickles either, pussycat. No comic relief anywhere. You see, these guys are Commies and it's 1961, the height of the cold war insanity. If you weren't around at the time, we were four minutes to midnight at any given moment. As in, ka-boom, it's all over now, baby blue. And the 'Inspired by true events' disclaimer at the beginning means here's another example of just how close we came to the last scene in the original Plant of the Apes.<br/><br/>Harrison and Neeson are everything but hateful and God-less. This is a soulful story about comrades and sacrifice being swept under the rug. The bad guys are the politicians and the military beauacracy. Sound familiar? These guys are closer to the TV David Hedison/Richard Basehart team that we all came to love on those pre-Sixty Minutes Sunday nights.<br/><br/>With a soulful musical score by real Russians, you can smell the borscht. You even see the  borscht in a shot of the galley. They ate pretty good in the Russian Navy. And those uniforms! Like Joan Rivers says, 'if you don't want gays in the military, stop making the uniforms so cute.""

Not bad credentials at all. The ship  has  the  realistic, very-un-slick look of cold war communism and comes off looking all Jules Verne-y with the austere wood interiors.

","This movie is a true treat worth the price of a regular tix... to open  my eyes to another piece of lost history!<br/><br/>Kathryn Bigalow's awesome direction provides an engrossing intensity to this 1961 piece of Russian history, which almost included a Chernobyl-like disaster, and a nuke war between the world's two super powers, at the height of the cold war era! Hey, if a Russian nuke disaster should happen near a Nato military base, what else can one expect? I like the way the film supports the historical facts at the beginning and ending of the film. There are so many scenes that fold without predictabilities and that makes the film so amazingly suspenseful and touching.  The accent of any performer is never a bother to me - as long as the dialogue doesn't slip from my hearing.<br/><br/>I find this film to be dramatically powerful and welcome the overwhelming throw of actions, happily short of any overwhelmingly spluttering of CGI effects! This film draws the viewers into the events at a wonderful pace, accompanied by the astounding Kirov Orchestral soundtracks. Boy, am I glad I wasn't one of those trapped in the submarine with the leaks, heat, explosions and radioactivity. Great character development; fabulous screen chemistry between all the actors! Oh yes, I enjoyed watching Harrison Ford's character with his cold and stoic expressions  - almost inhumane! Hey, did any of you see Harrison's tears slowly streaming from his eyes? A fabulous shot from the lens! And Liam Neeson's performance is astounding, never failing to convince the audience that he's a gentleman, very deserving of the respect from his men! And the two guys' opposing traits are magnetically intriguing. They are a pair of conflicting and snappy characters, facing a catastrophic arena.  And it's impossible not for the viewers to be equally and emotionally attracted to their ideals.  This film definitely is a revelation of what honorable heroes do in the name of honor, service and duty  without actually fighting a war! Amazing!<br/><br/>My salute to those heroes who remained true to their comrades and died, preventing a world nuke-war! This film succeeds in tearing my heart out for those dead Russian heroes.

","Contains Spoiler There was a sneak screening of Kathryn Bigalow's ""K-19 : The Widowmaker"" at the North Island United States Naval Air Base in San Diego, California last night and today and I was privileged to watch this film.<br/><br/>First of let me say this, I was very weary to go into a film with both two fine actors (and both Star Wars Alumni) Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson doing their best to hide Irish and American accents respectively, with Russian ones but I must admit the following...<br/><br/>""K-19"" is an amazing film. Sure it has it's plot holes, I mean heck what movie doesn't these days but as a Naval Submarine film acting on material that has been done before (Crimson Tide, Hunt for Red October, U-571 and Das Boot), it is a stand alone excellent film with lots of heart and patriotism, (for Russia I must add).<br/><br/>Harrison Ford's character is a complicated one as you don't know where his true intentions and loyalty lie from time to time in the film and maybe that worked in the roles favor by adding mystery?? But Harrison played the crucial moments very well and I was most impressed with his job in this film.  This sounds very early now but for the first time i think Ford may have actually found a film that could get him that Golden Dude that he has deserved for so long!  I hope the Academy does not shy from this film or his performance.  To do so would be a crime.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson seems to have been given the 'Star Wars - Episode I - I am Obi-Wan Kenobi and I am your servant standing in the background' treatment as his character really has trouble finding a piece of the pie to really hold on to. He really needed some gripping dialouge to keep his character interesting.  Only at the end does he add some mystique of his own to the film.  All through the film he talks of mutiny and his crews loyalty only to himself and how Ford's character is not as good as him but at a crucial part in the film, he for some reasons defies all logic and does the opposite of what we would have expected. This I did not understand. The scenes with him and Ford facing off, (ala Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman) give the film serious punch when some is needed!<br/><br/>The Special Effects were awesome and the soundtrack was moving but I must give props to one part of the film in particular and that was the final closing scene..***SPOILERS*** with Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson re-uniting with his surviving crew after 28 years of silence. I don't say this often but there was not a dry eye in the house.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film 8 stars out of 10. Kudos to Ford and Bigelow for making my Sunday afternoon enjoyable."

Maybe every director feels they must make a self-indulgent movie about people trapped in an elevator, or a cargo ship container, and then make us watch it for 2 hours--but that doesn't mean that they should.<br/><br/>In sum, a stirring tribute to the men of the Russian Navy who frequently died due to shoddy workmanship and general incompetence, yet were still poised to blow the U.S. to kingdom come."

Unfortunately for the crew, the K-19 really isn't all that ready for the mission, and while cruising beneath the Arctic ice pack, the nuclear reactor's cooling system springs a leak causing the reactor to heat up to explosive levels and exposing the crew to massive radiation poisoning. This could set off the subs nuclear warheads which could sink a nearby American ship and destroy a NATO base invariably igniting World War III. It's edge of the seat excitement, made even more gripping by rounded characters you care about.  Somehow Bigelow has taken us beyond our prejudices, making us see the crew not as ""evil"" Soviet stereotypes, but as men trapped in a desperate situation deserving our concern.  Harrison Ford as the submarine commander breaks away from his ""Harrison Ford"" persona delivering one of his finest acting performances since ""The Mosquito Coast.""

Since the end of the cold war, a few Russian subs can be visited in museums such as San Diego for example and they really are claustrophobic and narrow.<br/><br/>Once the sub starts to leak, the action cranks up, as some sailors risk their own lives to enter the leaking chamber, while Ford and Neeson clash as to whether to get help from the Americans.

","Back in the heat of cold war, the Soviet Union entered into an ill-advised technological advancement war. Despite initial much publicised success the effort strained the country, when funds and ingenuity were diverted from more pressing needs. Nonetheless the K-19 nuclear submarine was another great achievement of Russian thought, not to undermine the ultimate failure of internal machinery. Too proud for reason the Soviet Union decides to float the boat, despite an onslaught of minor faults still troubling the technical crew. The more familial Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) tries to delay deployment, but ultimately his superior and first-in-command Captain Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) holds the decision. Dedicated to the Soviet Union and instructions from above, despite misgivings Vostrikov orders the K-19 to be floated and the crew soon journeys into the international waters. Unfortunately, the unthinkable and inevitable occurs...<br/><br/>Unabashedly dedicated to war history Kathryn Bigelow warps the standard and delves into a story without American warships and submarine, instead omitting the ideological backdrop and capturing the human ordeal behind the ill-fated K-19. And this is her main point of valour, as unfortunately the story itself fails to really hit, sometimes forced to advance through standardised Hollywood gimmicks. Nonetheless the attempts to avert a nuclear catastrophe by the crew, who haphazardly try to weld a radioactive leak, is as gut-wrenching as it is mesmerising. Pretty damning liberties with the facts in order to guarantee 'narrative flow' are one point of contention, the other a somewhat 'ghost in the machine' resolution of the tentative relationship between Polenin and Vostrikov (not to mention that the whole worn-down theme of conflict between the ship captain and his second in charge seemed derivative to the more dreaded occurrences on the ship). The trite resolution of the conflict unmistakeably comes with buoyant music and some artless angelic comeuppance. Harrison Ford is of no help with his shifting accent and lack of conviction.<br/><br/>Making the movie feel somewhat like the submarine itself: a bloated chaotic mess released into the cinematic waters despite its apparent flaws. Not entirely successful in its endeavour, Bigelow does manage to show some of her directorial creds, but the overall product is watchable in its excess, but hardly memorable in retrospect."

","I love good submarine movies so I may be biased, but I also can't usually watch movies with preposterous script elements which require you to check your brain at the door. K-19 The Widowmaker happens to be both, and I never missed my brain the entire film.<br/><br/>You should have a good indicator of whether you will enjoy this film in the first 10 minutes- whether you can overcome the lame attempts by lead actors with pronounced American and Irish accents to sound Russian. If you can get past this, you should be able to disregard further implausibility and enjoy the engaging action and moving portrayals of heroism. Hopefully you're not looking for historical or factual accuracy either, as you won't find much here.<br/><br/>It isn't necessary to go into the specific plot details- it's a sub movie. The captain takes the sub down a little too deep; things groan and creak as the crew sweats. A fire breaks out. Things malfunction which imperil the ship, requiring the captain to make difficult decisions to send crew members into danger. Rinse, lather, repeat. This is a film which fulfills your expectations of a sub movie, not one which aspires to transcend them.<br/><br/>The one fresh ingredient K-19 adds to spice things up is the brilliant novelty of a ship with two captains. One commands the vessel, the other commands the loyalty and respect of its crew. One is loyal to the state and the mission at all costs, the other to the crew and their safety. Who are these two men? There is little back story or character development- we come to know them solely through their actions as the tension builds between men with motivations destined to come into conflict.<br/><br/>While believability dives below crush depth at numerous points, my enjoyment remained intact and I remained submerged in this adequately crafted and entertaining submarine thriller."

","I knew the two leadings stars, and then I saw how many stars the critics had given it, that wasn't going stop me watching it, I just wanted to see why only two, from director Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break, The Hurt Locker). Basically this is the true story of the USSR's first flagship nuclear ballistic submarine, on its maiden voyage in the North Atlantic in 1961, during the Cold War. Heading the crew is the uneasy Capt. Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) and his more popular executive officer Capt. Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson). After the completion, there is a sign that things could go wrong when the launching champagne bottle doesn't break, this is apparently a curse. This submarine is launched, and things seem alright for a while, the crew are getting tired by the many drills they have to do to reenact an emergency situation. Soon enough a real emergency reveals itself when there is a malfunction in the form of a leak in the nuclear reactor system, and the whole crew are working hard to fix it before a disaster occurs. It does look like the problem is fixed, but then the same problem happens again, and Polelnin and the crew finally have had enough and stops Captain Vostrikov from creating more stress. Don't worry, the problem is fixed and the crew do eventually get the help they need, and there is a reunion many years later with the surviving crew members, including Vostrikov and Polenin. Also starring Peter Sarsgaard as Lt. Vadim Radtchinko, Joss Ackland as Marshal Zelentsov, John Shrapnel as Admiral Bratyeev, Donald Sumpter as Dr. Gennadi Savran, Tim Woodward as Partonov and Johnny English's Steve Nicolson as Demichev. Ford does okay as the sub's leader, Neeson puts on an accent reminding us of Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins, the supporting cast are alright, and the film has its moments of thrills, but overall, it's not much of an action thriller. Okay!"

","Mr Liam Neeson and Mr Harrison Ford growl at each other like two grumpy old bears fighting over a hollow tree trunk.The loyalty of the O.R.s is stretched to breaking point as each manipulates his acolytes amongst the crew and lots of brave submariners sacrifice their lives to save their shipmates from a ""Chernobyl"" 25 years before its time. Clearly ""K 19"" is an unlucky ship.Sailors,superstitious creatures that they are, will be crossing their fingers,stroking their rabbits' feet etc right from the start of the movie as the bad omens mount up. However,a nuclear meltdown is not a nuclear explosion and the threat to world peace is rather exaggerated.Not that that in any way lessens their heroism,but hyperbole tends to detract from authenticity. Having recently watched Rutger Hauer's brilliant earlier ""Hostile Waters"", made on a low budget for TV,I can only remark on the similarity - which of course can only be a coincidence - to the basic plot of submariners risking their lives trying to fix a damaged nuclear reactor. Certainly Russia was paranoid about news leaking out to the West,it didn't acknowledge Chernobyl until it became self-evident,and then declined help from the U.S.,so it is easy to imagine that,a quarter of a century earlier,at the height of the Cold War,Premier Kruschev would not have looked kindly upon a submarine commander who sought assistance from the hated,feared and despised Americans. After ""detente"" came ""glasnost"" and the peace dividend of hundreds of Russian nuclear submarines rotting away somewhere in the Arctic Circle, an environmental ticking bomb far more immediately dangerous than any ""Global Warming"" theory. ""K 19 - Widowmaker"" is not a bad movie,it might have even been a timely reminder that heroism doesn't necessarily have to come wrapped in the Stars and Stripes,but it is long,noisy,and a bit over the top,a ""Titanic"" of submarine pictures.Neither Mr Neesom nor Mr Ford are particularly comfortable in their roles;charging up and down in a sweaty radioactive submarine is definitely work for one of the newer fellows.""Hostile Waters"" with whistles and bells"" is about what it amounts to."

They've developed a nuclear sub which Mr K has given the Red Navy but who shall command? There is Capt Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson). Mikhail is all Navy and worshiped by the men. The Soviet admiralty's concern is that he's a little too much in league with the men and won't take the right risks. Higher headquarters decides to supersede Capt Polenin with Captain Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) who has better standing in the political apparatus and is more daring. ""Without me,"" Capt Vostrikov tells the crew, ""you are nothing; without you I am nothing."" Though Captain Polenin professes that the change does not concern him, ""It's never difficult to do one's duty,"" Polenin tells Captain Vostrikov, the tension between hard charging, mission oriented Vostrikov and the plodder, crew oriented Polenin always hovering near the surface, explodes when Vostrikov brings the vessel from crush depth to break through the polar ice in seconds.<br/><br/>The real test of strength is just over the horizon. Like American vessels fitted with poor equipment to serve political ends, the Soviets have skimped not a bit on valves and dials. Can the democratic leader Polenin work with the autocratic leader Vostrikov to save the vessel? The film is interesting for presenting the essential contradiction, or dialectic to take a liberty with the Soviet political lexicon, in command. Leadership has two faces: one which argues for the men and the other for the mission. Before he had any idea of what this meant, Captain Vostrikov correctly said this on the ship's dedication. <br/><br/>Only few films compare to the magnificence with which the conflict between different styles of leadership: Twelve O'Clock High, Major Dundee and the Godfather."

","Putting aside how ironic is to watch an American movie tell a story about the URSS Army, putting aside any political or moral matters, I can say ""K-19"" is a nice movie which belongs to that sub-genre of submarines (along with Red Alert, Red October, etc.), nice filmed, with nice rhythm and a good narrative tension. Kathryn Bigelow'curriculum is not precisely the richest in Hollywood (""Point Break"" is a good action movie, but that's all), but this time she perfectly portraits what it means to be in a war submarine, the claustrophobia, the suffocating heat, the sweat... Though the movie length is +/- 140 m. it does not drag, on the contrary you quickly get into the story.<br/><br/>The election of veterans and experienced Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford to play the main roles is wise enough. You may find Harrison Ford's latest movies unworthy of an actor of his size (I do think so), but this time the movie is good enough and he does a good job as the submarine Captain.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up for the special effects that bring to life that impressive submarine.<br/><br/>*My rate: 6.5/10"

The Wackiest Ship In The Army, yes, but not a fact-based film.<br/><br/>Once again, a compelling true story is measurably diminished by deviations from the truth and other dramatic shortcuts. The fact that National Geographic was a party to the offense only makes me wonder what everyone was thinking when they pushed the ""print"" button on this script.<br/><br/>Thank goodness the actors were up to the task, fake Russian accents and all.

","This movies is seriously  one of the worst movies of its genre.  It is not because the subject matter is depressing and unappealing, which it is.  But rather, it is so boring and and terribly acted all around (Liam Neeson is the only one that is even watchable).  The idea of Harrison Ford as a Russian is so ludicrous. It is not because of his horrible accent, but rather his star quality (i.e. star persona) does not let him become the role.<br/><br/>There have been some comparisons in early comments about this being similar to ""Das Boot"" and ""Run Silent, Run Deep,"" but those comments are so of the mark it is scary.  The film is filmed so poorly and the cinematography is flat and has not depth of field, nor is there an sense of claustrophobia.  ""Das Boot"" was the master of submarine suspense simply due to its shot selection. ""U-571,"" although a popcorn flick was much more emotional than this cold fish. Oddly the film is so empty of emotion when the entire movie revolves around tragedy (This is not a spoiler).<br/><br/>I am shocked at how poorly Katheryn Bigelow directed this film.  She normally has the ability to create visually stimulating films, even if they aren't the greatest. ""Strange Days"" had some beautiful moments, although the script was a mess and there was no mystery to the the actual plot.  ""Near Dark"" was campy but quite beautiful.  And, although her film ""The Weight of Water"" was derided by critics, the scenes with Sarah Polley were fantastic and wonderfully shot, including some really great handheld camera work.  Of course, everyone say that her handheld chase scene in ""Point Break"" is one of the best shots she has ever composed, but I disagree.<br/><br/>If you want to check out a Bigelow film, look for the gem ""Blue Steel"" with Jamie Lee Curtis, Ron Silver, and a nice small role by Louise Fletcher.  There are some gorgeous shots in it the and some of the lighting is quite nice, if nit a little too much use of blue filters.   Although, I do think the storyline is a little cliched at times.  But then again, I am not really a fan of Ron Silver.  He has his moments, but seems wrong for that part.  He doesn't have the ability to match up to Curtis's -masculinity- if that is what it is.<br/><br/>Well, in terms of ""K-19: Widowmaker,"" I place the blame squarely on Bigelow. The idea isn't awful; the notion of tragic dilemmas faced by authoritative figures and how to deal with them psychologically is in interesting concept.  But the movie fails so miserably.  There are way too many dramatic scenes of Ford contemplating the submarine's problematic scenarios.  Additionally, some of the lighting, specifically the scenes filmed with an overbearing red, is so dull and washes out the actors' faces.  The rest of the film is brown and and devoid of all color.  Not that there should be a myriad of color filling the screen. But color, even in small doses, is important to the psychologically of a film SPOILER (the ice scenes are the only semi-beautiful shots).  I don't mean that bright colors should be employed gratuitously.  A great use of muted colors, specifically grey, as in the Untouchables, are quite beautiful, but that is usually falls to the art direction, costumes, and DP.  Unfortunately, all colors in ""Widowmaker"" are one color (e.g. blue, red, white), and use lighting and filters poorly for the effect they are trying to convey.<br/><br/>Well, as you can tell, I think this movie deserves all the the bad reviews it received.  There are a lot of submarine movies out there that are very good, or at least competent (e.g. ""The Abyss,""  although not really a true submarine movie; ""Innerspace,"" Dennis Quaid was in a type of submarine-- I know it's a stretch; of course there are the standards: ""U-571,"" ""Das Boo,"" and ""Crimson Tide,"" all of which use colors effectively and and have a great sense of camera movement and composition; finally, the best submarine movie ever made (well maybe ""Das Boot"" takes that honor) is ""Below,"" and amazing David Twohy movie, co-written by Darren Arronofsky).<br/><br/>In conclusion, avoid ""K-19"" unless you want to sleep or make fun of some of the worst shots ever employed in a large budget film.  Hell, even though people seem to hate ""Waterworld,"" although I quite like it for its ""Road Warrior"" quality, you have to admit that Dean Semler has some of the most beautiful compositions in that film.  Or maybe they are Reynolds, or Costners....who knows with that troubled film.<br/><br/>AVOID ""K19: WIDOWMAKER"" AT ALL COSTS, UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE REMINDED OF A BAD A 80'S MOVIE, LIKE THAT ONE WHERE KANSAS  (OR SOME MIDDLE OF THE US STATE) WAS ATTACKED BY A  THE RUSSIANS. THIS MOVIE IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE ""RUSSIA HOUSE,"" NOT A HORRIBLE CONCEPT, JUST THE WORST PRODUCTION I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.  AT LEAST YOU CAN LAUGH AT ""SHOWGIRLS,"" AND AT LEAST ""A LIFE LESS ORDINARY"" WAS SO BAD THAT AND WEIRD THAT YOU DON'T FORGET IT.  THERE ARE STILL IMAGES I CAN'T SHAKE FROM MY HEAD, AS HARD AS I TRY.  NOT THAT THOSE MOVIES HAVE ANY CONNECTION TO ""K-19.""  I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD ILLUMINATE MY  TASTES IN CASE SOMEONE MIGHT ENJOY MOVIES THAT I FIND ATROCIOUS.<br/><br/>Well....I guess this was another morning diatribe.   I am not sure anyone reads these.  Yet writing is terribly interesting and especially when you get to realize the amount of money that is wasted on a film (what happened to Ford? ""What Lies Beneath"" was such a great movie that borrowed so many beautiful shots from Hitchcock and Welles).  But you have to take the good with the bad.<br/><br/>""Master and Commander"" was worth every penny they spent.  If only there were going to be a sequel based on one of the other books, but I don't see the financial possibility given its current gross.  It is never good to say ""never"" though.<br/><br/>Well.... I am going to stop writing just because I want to stop annoying anyone who put up with reading this unimportant crap; and, I have to say, it is only my two cents.  Maybe I should have bought a gumball with my two cents instead of venting.   Cherry is the tastiest gumball.  Otherwise, if they don't have cherry, I think I will opt for raspberry.  Oh decisions.

"Piafredux","Null","0","1","11 September 2003"," Solid Effort That Will Improve Over Time
","The problem with this solid story is that, pre-release and upon premiere, it was oversold as a blockbuster. Of course, as do so many films about America's military which purport to depict a historical event, the story was overlaid with the unnecessary and false dramatics of the skipper vs. executive officer command-style conflict, a burdensome device which only detracted from the terseness and impact of the central drama.<br/><br/>Instead of that ersatz melodrama I expect K-19 would have benefitted from a bit more character revelation of the junior officer and enlisted crewmembers. For instance: we never find out how the poor man whose hand got pulped in the torpedo hoist chain comes to fare: a little vignette of a buddy visiting the injured sailor in sick bay, perhaps talking wistfully of their sweethearts or wives and children, would have served the story much better by foreshadowing and mirroring the plight of their later-crippled vessel.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford serves - I can't say ""acts"" - well, if not splendidly, in the role of a Soviet sub captain: he portrays a stolid technician-cum-ideologue humanized by his experience aboard K-19, and who is disillusioned yet reconciled by his ex-crew to professional pride at the story's close which occurs after the demise of the Soviet Union. Liam Neeson is fine as the sub's executive officer, despite his having been burdened with the unhistorical plot conflict between his character and Ford's. The other actor hobbled by Hollywood's insistence on showing the rabidly political Nazi officer stereotype was, in this case, the poor guy who had to play the spineless party commissar: let me assure you that party commissars for service aboard Russky nuke boats were not chosen from the ranks of the wishy-washy or the ideologically dubious.<br/><br/>Though it's used here as a drama-heightening device, whether, or not, the sub's nigh-melting-down nuclear reactor would actually have caused the vessel's nuclear armaments to have detonated is immaterial: the core of the story is the self-sacrifice of the crew volunteers who deliberately exposed themselves to lethal overdoses of gamma rays to save their shipmates.<br/><br/>Whether, or not, sailors are warriors or merchant mariners, their first battle is always with the sea - a battle that often involves sailors having to live with the consequences of the feebleness of marine engineering pitted against the vast, pitiless environment in which their technology must sail...and survive. This is the heart of the story of the ""unsinkable"" RMS Titanic, and it's the crux of the story of K-19: human frailty and smallness versus the implacable sea - and equally implacable physics.<br/><br/>There's one glaring blooper. When we first see Harrison Ford's character uniforming himself, detraining in the Moscow railway station, and climbing the grand staircase of the naval headquarters, he's wearing on his greatcoat the shoulder board insignia of a Captain Second Rank. Immediately after ascending the headquarters stairs, when Ford's shown in the headquarters room getting his orders from the admirals and the Red Army marshal (played by Joss Ackland), he's wearing on his reefer jacket (which is worn under the winter greatcoat) the shoulder board insignia AND the cuff rank lace of a Captain First Rank. In the next sequence - his arrival on the Kola Peninsula to take command of K-19 - his shoulder board insignia have magically returned to those of a Captain Second Rank. Considering that the DVD of K-19 contains a special feature devoted to the production's attention to details - which were in all other respects lavish, accurate, and pleasing - this insignia blooper is cruelly obvious.<br/><br/>K-19's central ""character"" profits also from extensive cosmetic and seaworthy conversion from a smaller ex-Soviet sub to mimic the dimensions and profile of the real K-19: a costly but worthwhile expense that delivers realism unachievable with CGI.<br/><br/>Overall I liked the film and its central narrative and how it was told; and the storytelling provoked me to sympathize with the plight of K-19's crew and to admire their humanity, comradeship, and heroism. I expect this is one of those films that's underappreciated at its debut, yet one which will earn its due of greater acclaim in later years. Kathryn Bigelow's direction is surehanded at K-19's documentary style and at its larger, more sweeping cinemaphotography (composition-in-frame is quite good actually as seen, for examples, in the pre-launching and christening scenes), and I hope she will make more films I shall enjoy seeing.

It still has a nice story and some nice scene's and acting and the music also makes this movie worth seeing. It just adds nothing new and compared to other submarine movies it's just bad...<br/><br/>So watch another submarine movie instead.<br/><br/>5/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Spleen","Null","0","1","23 March 2003"," Would have done better if it had had a different title
","I was going to make a few pedestrian complaints: you know, about the fake Russian accents, and the somewhat bald exposition and dialogue at the start... and also, and I think I really will complain about this, the silly title. Titles shouldn't have colons. Call your film ""K-19"", or call it ""The Widowmaker""; don't try to have it both ways.<br/><br/>But such concerns are washed away by what happens when the voyage is underway. Before it's over we're made to watch disturbing footage of sailors working away inside the bit of the reactor where ten minutes' exposure might not have been fatal if they'd been wearing radiation suits, which they weren't; we're also made to endure the sight of their their blistered flesh afterwards. It's hard going watching this. But here's the thing: at no point did I resent being shown this. We needed to see it, really, for the characters to have been treated with the proper amount of respect. Showing us the horrible nuclear scars is not gratuitous nastiness, not manipulation, but just a way of making sure that we get our taste of the natural consequences of the situation, too.<br/><br/>I was forced to the conclusion that this is a film with very little in the way of false heroics. For the most part it's the real thing. Cold-war Russia, like the USA, was isolated from the world at large; the armed forces of both countries were (and are) isolated still further; and, as if more isolation is even possible, these sailors were effectively imprisoned on a secret submarine in the middle of nowhere. They're torn between fear of the immediate physical dangers facing them, fear of what the state could do to them even if they survive, and fear of nuclear war. No wonder their hands are inclined to shake. Bigelow gets all of this across and, more importantly, doesn't forget any of it just for the sake of getting a plot point or one-liner across.<br/><br/>At least, she doesn't do so while the sub is at sea. If you were to start the film with the ship setting out and end it with ... well, the end of the voyage (I won't say how it ends), you'd have a faultless film. Alas, there's an epilogue. It's such a stupid one it's hard even to connect it with what has gone before.<br/><br/>It ends with the same poisonous message of such standard modern-day hymns to the military as ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""We Were Soldiers"". It's the ""we don't fight for cause or country, we fight for each other"" spiel. I've heard this echoed so often by people who serve in the US armed forces (or claim to) it makes my blood run cold. A group of people are handed (in this case) a submarine capable of launching nuclear missiles, and we're asked to accept that it's a GOOD THING that the only obligation these people feel they have is to one another? The army is an instrument designed to kill people, and we actually want to LET it think that it's the only thing that matters? That it's above not only the law but morality as well?<br/><br/>The preceding film makes nonsense of this. The crew of K-19 elect to submerge their ship and risk their lives rather than risk an accident which might see the United States retaliate against Moscow precisely because they DO have other things on their mind. These people, luckily, are human beings first and sailors second. So why is the prologue - which really begins with the military trial the officers face upon their return - even there? Why is it allowed to have precisely the same revolting flavour (watered down, thank goodness) that films subsidised and vetted by the Pentagon invariably have?<br/><br/>I suspect so much of this drivel is being produced that it now finds its way into perfectly good films, like this one, by accident."

","Greetings again from the darkness.  Missed this one during its theatrical run, so caught it on video.  Much better than expected submarine drama aided immensely by the real life facts and wonderful cast.  Director Kathryn Bigelow is quite the paradox.  Before this she had directed 2 terrible films (""Blue Steel"" ""Point Break"") and two interesting films (""Strange Days"" ""The Weight of Water"").  I guess right now she is one up!  By no means a classic, ""K-19"" does hold one's attention and creates a bit of caring for a few characters.  Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson create the strength and empathy necessary for the leads, while rarely letting the script take them too far. Sub scenes are at times breathtaking and the sound can be deafening.  The fear of reactor failure is real, but not overdone.  Very watchable drama, even if it is not ""Das Boot""."

","Its great movie with suspense, action, and heroism.  Its from a different point of view then usual, the Russian point of view.  Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson are great actors and play they parts very well.  Its a different part for Harrison Ford to play and he does it very well. The movie was very well made and looks very well.  Go see it you won't go home unhappy."
"nicki875","10","0","1","1 August 2002"," Overall, one of the year's best
","This year, a variety of films have captured audiences attentions such as the light-hearted comedies, About a Boy and My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and the action-packed thrilling adventures of Minority Report and Reign of Fire. Other films disappoint audiences' expectations like Men in Black II but remain nonetheless fun to watch.  And then there's Halloween: Resurrection and Eight Legged Freaks which I won't even discuss.  While eating our popcorn waiting anxiously to see all these highly anticipated films, we see a trailer for something different.  We see Harrison Ford (one of our favorites) dressed in naval attire with a very peculiar accent.  Next we hear words such as ""fate of the world"", and ""lies in the hands of a group of men"" and our attention becomes captivated.  Then we see Liam Neeson (who could forget Schindler's List) and put it on our list of films to see.<br/><br/>For some reason, however, K-19 did not sky-rocket at the box office.  This could possibly be due to the fact that in this movie the heroes toast to communism and despise the Americans.  Movie-goers wrote this one off as not exactly the type of film they look forward to seeing in light of previous events.  I, though, am not one to pass off a seemingly good suspense movie and find that rooting for the enemy (Das Boot) broadens one's mind during a time when we doubt if we can trust the rest of the world.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on Naval Captain Alexei Vostrikov (Harrison Ford), devoted to the Soviet Union as was his father before him, who becomes the chief commander (forgive my poor naval terms) of K-19, the world's most powerful submarine.  Under his command is the crew of Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson), a group of young, hardworking but laid back men who aren't exactly up to the expectations of Vostrikov.  Polenin himself is adored by his men and considers his duty to be to protect his men and the people of the Soviet Union rather than to risk all in case of actual war with the Americans. Vostrikov and Polenin have an agree-to-disagree relationship which boils when underway over risking the lives of men to see ""where the edge is.""  To make matters worse, the crew has nicknamed their submarine ""The Widowmaker"", due to the numerous deaths of crew members during the ship's build not to mention the doctor being run over by a truck only to be replaced with another who gets ""a little seasick."" The crew's fears are realized when radiation spreads throughout the sub due to a leak causing the core temperature to rise.  The crew must find a way to repair the damage and perform their tasks as men of honor despite their loss of faith in themselves as well as in their commander.<br/><br/>Director Kathryn Bigelow illustrates the claustrophobia of a submarine and the tension between Vostrikov and his men magnificently.  The audience feels the nervousness of what these men must have felt and can truly see the courage of the seven men who tried to stop the leak.  Rather than focusing on special effects, she focuses on the inner struggle of each individual man as he searches for the courage within him.  Hopefully, we'll be seeing more of this brilliant director in a time when special effects and crude humor is what it's all about.<br/><br/>Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson lead the film nicely.  Both roles are incredibly difficult to portray and each was able to nicely add depth to his character.  The accent on Harrison Ford, however, was definitely not one of the film's highlights.  He does a superb job though of convincing the audience of the worthiness of his cause.  The main highlights of the film, however, are the supporting cast.  Peter Sarsgaard is wonderful as Vadim Radtchenko.  He adds humanity to the film being the character the audience can relate to.  We can sense his fear as well as his determination. Despite his deserving of it, unfortunately I highly doubt the Academy will remember him next year.  Christian Camargo portrays Pavel Loktev with great passion and depth as well.  Other greats include the two antagonists Yuri Demichev (Steve Nicolson) and Igor Suslov (Ravil Issayanov).  The audience is able to see their fear and distrust in their captain and relate to them as real people as well.  Another supporting character who is not often mentioned is Anatoly Starkov portrayed by James Ginty.  Ginty illustrates the humanity of the men aboard the K-19.  While we see many of the other characters as soldiers, we see his character's boyish innocence as well as his unquestionable bravery.  Hollywood is in desperate need of a young male actor like him in an era of Josh Hartnetts and Chris Kleins.<br/><br/>Overall, K-19 delivers entertainment unlike any other movie of the year thus far.  The film is suspenseful as well as touching and delivers superb performances as well as excellent direction.  Although possibly not oscar-worthy, it is unquestionably one of the year's best so far."

","I went to K-19 hoping for an Apollo 13 / 13 Days-type retelling of a true story, with some dramatic license but still with trust in the actual flow of events. (Hmm, maybe if this had been K-13)<br/><br/>What the film makers delivered, however, was a decent military drama, with the usual raft of flaws one has come to expect from Hollywood. I shall mention just a few:<br/><br/>1) Harrison Ford should have been told at the start, ""Don't bother with a fake Russian accent, nobody else on the sub is doing one either.""<br/><br/>2) When the sub starts to crush, they should have remembered to keep it crushed for the remainder of the movie.<br/><br/>3) Since the conflict between the two captains was (to the best of my knowledge) fabricated for the sake of the script, they should have come up with a better one. Also, Liam Neeson encourages thoughts of mutiny in his officers, but then scolds them and locks them up when they act on his encouragement. Furthermore, the repeated change of heart that Ford's captain has, regarding whether to let the crew off the sub to save their lives, just does not click with the events that are shown; his attitude flip-flops seem purely script-driven.<br/><br/>Decent summer movie, but not a must-see."

","I'm an action movie buffs, and I enjoy military thrillers, but I guess keeping K-19: The Widowmaker true to life had an impact on how much action the film could really have.<br/><br/>K-19: The Widowmaker sets up a great conflict of personalities, but ultimately it fizzles out, leaving a film with a fair amount of action, but not as good as ""U-571"" and certainly not as good as the classics ""Crimson Tide"" or ""The Hunt for Red October"".<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- action buffs on a rainy day<br/><br/>-- anybody interested in Cold War drama, on a rainy day<br/><br/>I'll give K-19: The Widowmaker a not bad, nothing special 6 out of 10."

","K-19: The Widowmaker is based on the happenings aboard the first Russian Nuclear Submarine.  The beginning is slow, with Harrison Ford demanding drills aboard and changing things to meet the schedule rather than safety the requirements, foreshadowing sure disaster. Once going, however, K-19 delivers an intense ride through the life of an early nuclear submariner as well as the boat in which this submariner is aboard.  But, with the slow beginning and a not so good Russian accent by Liam Neeson, I considered giving it a 6, reconsidered and gave it a 7.  I'd wait for the cheap theaters."

","K-19: THE WIDOWMAKER (2002) **1/2 Harrison Ford, Liam Neeson, Peter Sarsgaard.  Based on actual events this Cold War thriller suffers from Hollywood-ization all too blatantly in taking its story about a Russian nuclear submarine making its maiden voyage to the United States with its dueling captains (a blunt Ford and a noble Neeson, both sporting questionable Soviet accents) facing impossible odds when a radioactive leak threatens their mission.  The script by Christopher Kyle and Louis Nowra have the best intentions in showing the Â‘enemy' in a humane light that succeeds but is only lost when the limp third act bows to political correctness and predictability throughout loses the intent: unsung heroes in a nightmarish situation.  Director Kathryn Bigelow plays all her cards right even if they are stacked against her favor; she does the best she can in the waterlogged histrionics set up."

","I got free passes for 2 for a sneak peak from a local news weekly.  [The seats were really comfy and the food way over priced, but what's new about that.]  There are some great visual/special effects moments in the film and everything seems very true to life.  And that blue building in Moscow that shows up twice, sure looks like the ""Russian White House"" where Yeltsen stood his ground during the coup attempt that ended the Communist Party's control of the Soviet Union.  Filming on location in the real location always adds to a film's quality.<br/><br/>The musical score was excellent.  Though I think the best music in a movie about a Soviet Sub, was the singing of the Soviet national anthem in Hunt for Red October by the entire sub crew.<br/><br/>I was surprised at the PG-13 rating.  I would not recommend this movie for anyone under 13.  This movie is not for the easily scared, nail biters, or those who do not have a strong stomach.  If I tell you why you need a strong stomach, it might give things away.  While I have seen the movie, I haven't seen the trailers or TV ads, so I don't know how much they give away in advance."
