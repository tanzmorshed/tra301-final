","One of the best romance movies I have ever seen and one of my favorite movies that I have ever seen. I loved the book and I loved the movie even more. The writing, plot, story, and screenplay were fantastic. Shaileen Woodley and Ansel Elgort's performances in the film as Hazel and Augustus were spectacular. The Fault in Our Stars is gorgeous, funny and sad at the same time and it shows true love can be found no matter what. Loved it so much."

","I went into this movie not having read the book and not knowing anything more than the overall plot. I am a sucker for a good love story, especially love that I can relate to. The pain and emotions felt by the characters felt so real, as if I was feeling the same emotions.<br/><br/>Though this was THE SADDEST movie I have ever seen, it was also one of the most beautiful, as it truly showed how exhilarating and comforting and exciting love is. <br/><br/>I probably cried throughout about half of the movie, along with the rest of the audience. I cried to the point of heaving out loud and needing more than the 2 tissues I came in with. Again, the actors really expressed the emotions of the characters well and I felt that. <br/><br/>I am going to see it again for sure.<br/><br/>GO SEE IT IF YOU LOVE EMOTIONAL MOVIES!"
"AniConrad","10","120","155","21 July 2014"," A Beautiful Love Story: Going to love it for the longest of the infinity
","'Some infinities are bigger than other infinities' says my favorite quote from the movie (and the book) and its true because I am going to love this movie for the longest of the infinity. I am a huge fan of the book and one thing which really makes the movie stand out is an amazing performance by Shailene Woodley. She is outstanding in every scene she is and I have to say I am kind of in love with Hazel. Even though its a love story of a girl who has terminal cancer I wouldn't say that the film is tragic rather the film is about living your life to the fullest in your 'little infinity' If you have already read the book, the film is true to the book and the great acting, directing and music adds another dimension to the story. The Fault In Our Stars is definitely one of the best romantic movies ever. When you see this movie you are going to laugh and you are going to cry and when the end credit roles I can guarantee most of you are going to be completely in love with this love story."
"Victreebong","8","140","184","12 June 2014"," Would happily see this again!
","Average American guy right here, and I dug this flick. I don't care how many 13 year olds were in the theater with me, this movie has emotion. After watching the Descendents, I knew Woodley was going places. She simply delivers in this movie. I'm not going to write a long winded review about the summary, but I will tell you about the acting.<br/><br/>Elgort and Woodley truly deliver. You forget they're acting each and every scene. The chemistry between the two is palpable. Laura Dern comes out of nowhere; I think the last time I've seen her face was JP. She puts up a pretty good role as Woodley's torn mother. Defoe is pure love/hate on almost a House level. In fact, he goes beyond House hatred with his apathy in this movie. And the two's sidekick (Wolff) is loads of comic relief, which is surprising considering that he too is in the therapy group. The rest of the cast is just kind of there (sorry Tramell). But that's because the camera is on Woodley and Elgort the entire time. I don't even think there's a scene except for flashbacks where the two are absent.<br/><br/>As far as the movie... An emotional roller-coaster. You will get addicted to their relationship. You will cry big man tears internally (and probably externally) after 1.5 hours. You will be emotionally drained."

"itsjoshykho","8","382","549","4 June 2014"," I've Saved my Ten for This Film
","Before I continue with this review, please note that I have not read the book, but am going to in the very near future :) Please note that Im also a (straight) guy... not that it matters :P<br/><br/>Wow what can I say about this movie. From the moment the title sequence starts, I was hooked straight away. Scene to scene this movie just manages to suck me into this beautiful world of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. The chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elsort is astounding and the performances were astonishing. Honestly, this is the best movie I have seen all year, even better than Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Godzilla which was a massive surprise. I just thought this was going to be another teenie love story and boy was I wrong. I loved this movie and recommend it to everyone across all ages. I'm rambling on and praising the movie now so I should probably get on with the review.<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography was fantastic. Not a single shot felt odd or out of place. Every shot matched the scene and felt real. The editing was also great as shot after shot matched with the characters faces and where they were (typical good movie editing stuff). <br/><br/>The acting perhaps was one of the best aspects of this movie. Seriously it makes the two characters feel real and alive, and at times I forgot this was fiction and not based on a true story. Their performances were so heartfelt and definitely Oscar worthy in my opinion. But knowing the academy this is just another teenie love story that will not be acknowledged at all. Hopefully I'm wrong, but thats the way it normally is. <br/><br/>This is the first movie this year that I have given a 10. I don't give out 10's easily, but there was seriously nothing wrong with this film. The pacing was perfect, the acting was phenomenal, the direction, editing and cinematography was exceptional and overall, this movie is one of the best romantic comedies that have ever touched the face of the earth. I encourage EVERYONE to go see this movie no matter what age you are and bring a packet of tissues as well. You'll need it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Semidieu","10","184","259","31 May 2014"," Was this shot on film? Cause there's a lot of chemistry involved!
","This movie, simply put, is worth each and every one of its 125 minutes. Including the closing credits, that you need to dry your eyes and think about what you just saw. It's the inspiring story of two young people who are no different then all of us, as they both are in the process of dieing. Though Hazel Grace and Augustus are more aware of this fact of life; because their Â„eternity"" has an expiration date, set by Hazels terminal illness: Cancer. <br/><br/>As the viewer is put on an emotional roller-coaster, alongside the feelings and attitudes towards life and love the two teens share, this movie will be a key to many locked doors in the recepients minds. And through these doors we are lead by an ensemble of actors who are amazingly sensitive in their portrayal of personalities and emotions.<br/><br/>The writing and directing is so brilliantly executed, that you have sympathy with every character this movie so caringly brings to (short) life. Even when they oppose another you feel unable to take sides. Because you find yourself sharing both. And when the credits role - like the tears on your cheek - you realize, that these opposing views are one and the same after all: Life."

","Wow. Being an avid book reader, I'm always skeptical about watching the words of my favorite books transformed and materialized on the big screen... but TFIOS stayed true to the book. The movie was absolutely lovely from beginning to end. The young actors were great. The comedy hit on all the right notes, the romance made your heart smile and the tragedy pulled at your heart strings. It really was a wonderful adaptation, and I believe it stayed as true to the book as possible without many changes where there were any. The minute it was over, I wanted to watch it again. Upon leaving the theater, I looked around and there was not one dry eye. Not even the men. If you are a big fan of the book, like myself... and are skeptical about whether this stays true. Don't be. Kudos the John Green on his first film adaptation. It was an absolute success. I'd give it a 10 out of 10 if I could... but I don't believe in ""perfect."""

","I don't really cry in movies unless they're really, really sad. And this movie is bound to get you crying like there's no tomorrow. I brought a box of tissues and I used about half of them. I have never cried so much in my entire life. Being an avid fan of the book, I was kind of scared that like some of my other favourite books, the movie would be ruined. But no, the movie had all of the book's materials in it (except for one thing). I never thought Shailene and Ansel would play Hazel and Gus, but when I watched it, their performance blew me away. I think Shailene's ability to cry got ME crying, because that's how real it felt. It is an amazing movie, and I'm sorry to say that it's even better than A Walk to Remember. Go see this movie, and if you do, maybe read the book first so that you can be somewhat prepared!"
"bez1218","9","9","10","2 March 2015"," Let's just be honest here
","OK so here's the thing. I was so not going to bother writing a review for this movie. Yes I loved it however there were things in the book I think should have been in the movie. That's why I give it a 9 not a 10! Now the reason I'm writing this review, this movie is sad. It promises to be sad just by the decription and the trailer. Looking at the cover tells you that it's going to be romantic. If you do not like these types of movies or you are a heartless bonehead like the guy that gave this heartfelt movie a 1 and wishes he could have given a 0, do not watch this movie. My fiancÃ© put it right, this movie (and book) is The Notebook on steroids! You will cry.You will get mad at the crying because it won't stop. And above all you will watch it again and again thinking each time you'll make it without a single tear. That will not happen but you'll try anyway. Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters will steal your heart and the end is the hardest part. Yes someone dies but who I won't spoil that. Its not who you think btw."

","Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort both have arrows strongly pointing upwards. Both shine brightly in this movie and suck you in from the get- go. Following up their (sibling) pairing in Divergent, they both flash a wide range of chops here. Woodley is charming and smart, and Elgort majorly surprised me showing off a comical side. Also very smart.<br/><br/>I won't spoil anything, but I did not read the book so I had no/low expectations and was sucked in early on, and definitely was attached to the characters throughout.

"AminGhanbari","8","6","7","8 July 2015"," We call it LOVE
","Imagining a day without love has become impossible since I watched this movie. No matter which kind of love we focus on, what really matters is this that an antidote to all poisons and a key for all doors has been summarized into 4 words; LOVE.<br/><br/>It was a year ago when I started reading John Green's novel, ""The Fault In Our Stars"". I found out from the first pages that at least one guy could finally find a new way to anecdote a romance story and do believe in this fact that this guy could make a revolution in this genre. Actually, as a person who usually writes about different subjects, I had never ever thought about this kind of relationship. A relationship between two teenagers whom both suffer from cancer and in a way are strange. Not only the idea of this story is something pure but also the words which writer's used to communicate better with readers are among the best ones. anyway, accept my apology because we are here not for the book's review but because of the movie's one.<br/><br/>Like all the reviews I have here on IMDb, screenplay is the first item in which I'm interested to talk to you about it. As you know when you want to make a movie out of a successful novel or story which has acclaimed critical praises without any pictures, you have a hard job to do not only because of this fact that you are not able to change everything you want but also because of this fact that maybe changing words affects reader's mind. Here the writers could've done their job in its best way. Just follow these four simple steps and then you will find out why I'm telling you this. 1-Open The Book 2-Read It 3-Watch The Movie 4-Review The Book , and you feel that you've seen all the things you expected without any deficiencies. That's exactly the reason I know this title as an important movie. Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber have done their best.<br/><br/>About the casts, I searched, but couldn't find anyone better than Shailene Woodley as Hazel and Ansel Elgort as Gus. We've seen them before in the Divergent but here they show how good they are. Two things would be enough to prove their abilities; The way Ansel Elgort tries to communicate with all audiences and his co star by his body language and without any dialogue and sometimes just by staring into Hazel's eyes which shows that he has overwhelmed by his role and his character and the way Hazel tries to convince you she is in love with Gus. So, they've done their job perfectly. Actually, I've become one of their fans since I watched this movie and their amazing collaboration with each other.<br/><br/>As a conclusion, I prefer to write about the best scene of the movie, based on my own opinion. I think the scene that Gus asked Hazel to write him a funeral speech and asked her to read it in front of him, while he was alive and was there in his own funeral ceremony, was the best scene. The way they became sad, the way they became happy by reviewing their memories and etc. all together would be enough to convince you how memorable this scene is.<br/><br/>I think if you are interested in romance movies you should watch this movie. Believe me! it's a good one. <br/><br/>Best Regards, <br/><br/>Amin Ghanbari"

Great book, fantastic movie. The emotion of the actors made John Greens New York Times Best Seller, real. They brought depth to our pages, they brought emotion to our dripping eyes, and they brought warmth to our hearts. <br/><br/>The movie is about a teenage girl who has terminal lung cancer, she was saved by a experimental treatment when she was younger. Now as she is older, her parents feel that she is suffering from depression which is, as Hazel describes it a ""side affect of dying."" Her parents encourage her to go to a cancer support group where she meets Agustus Waters, ex-cancer carrier and minus one leg. Soon Hazel and Gus find themselves head over heels planning to love each other until oblivion ultimately catches up with them. <br/><br/>A ""sick love story""<br/><br/>The actors casted for these roles were amazing. Shailene, played Hazel flawlessly, she was smart, and funny and cold just as Hazel was. Ansel, was equally amazing, his amazing humor and timing made this movie! The amazing actors and actresses combined with the entire crew, the way the movie was filmed is just inviting, and they way text messages and emails were displayed will start a new movie trend.<br/><br/>Some call it a tear jerker, some revolutionary, but me, I call it a spectacularly made masterpiece. You will laugh and you will cry. And some parts will send those magical shivers down your spine.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to...

"robyndolls2859","10","37","64","7 July 2014"," The best film I've seen.
","Without me blabbering on, I would like to give my complements to John Green and his Team. The Fault In Our Stars is a fantastic book which has a really sad ending (I'm not going to say it to you). As the quote says ""Some Infinities are bigger than others"" however, Hazel and Gus's love was quite an extraordinary one. It must of been hard living with Cancer. The book was different, but it still had the same story to the film but with more parts. I got the book after the film came out so my book has the photos in it. I have to say I did cry at the end but I couldn't stop blabbering through the film. Too be honest, Hazel Grace has inspired me. Not everything in life is perfect and people are dying, this book showed the good and bad sides to cancer. <br/><br/>Like the book says, pain demands to be felt. It touched my sad side. This book is one of the best. Thank you."
"pamma09","10","45","81","6 June 2014"," True to the book
","I read the book several months ago and have been anxious for the movie. So this grandmother went with her 16 yr old grandson who had also read the book. We are both happy with the adaptation. The story of two teens with cancer who meet in a support group for teens, neither want sympathy and both knowing they will die - want to live life. They exchange books and because of the ending of one and the questions they have - they email the author in Amsterdam. Because he had not used up is 'wish' they end up being able to go there and have the chance to meet the author. Willam Defoe portrays the alcoholic author so well - you do not like him. Gus also tells Hazel something he has been keeping from her. Gus and Hazel have their ups and downs and knowing their time may be limited their love is fresh and true - and presented so well. All the acting is good, the sets, the music -and there is a lot of music but I did not notice most of it - a sign of a good movie score. I volunteer in a hospice facility and it was so good to see the presentation of their cancer as real. Their feelings of what they are going thru as real. I will read the book again and see the movie again - it is worth it."
"o_oraculo","1","285","592","14 June 2014"," Too many people are idiots.
","I give it ""1"" because IMDb doesn't let me give it 0. I never wrote a review before, but seeing the average of 8.5 gave me a feeling of never being able to trust IMDb again.<br/><br/>I usually check movie scores in IMDb to decide if I should watch it in the theaters. Below 7 is lame (except for comedies which gets lower scores). 7 to 8 maybe. 8 and up must see (except for this movie). Seeing an 8.5 I went to the theater excited. I hope someone like me is out there and reads this review before he wastes his time and money with it.<br/><br/>What I saw: Boring, depressing, cynic, pessimist, average looking to slightly good looking girl has lung cancer. The audience is led to believe she is smart because she read the same book 1000 times over (doing that isn't smart) and goes to college (which she doesn't really).<br/><br/>She goes to a support group where good hearted, Christian, cancer survivor (which is made to look like a loser) helps young people who have cancer. <br/><br/>There, she meets 2 characters: 1) eye cancer guy who is going to have to remove them and has a huge boobed (to good for him) girlfriend, who will leave him 10 minutes later. 2) his friend, an extremely athletic, pretty, extremely confident guy (even though he's a virgin (yeah right *rolls eyes*)) who is also a cancer survivor (lost a leg to it, but is paradoxically still very athletic). <br/><br/>Even though his value on the meat market is much higher than the protagonist girl's value, he only has eyes for her, even without her saying anything but depressing things.<br/><br/>At the end of the meeting, if being athletic, pretty and confident isn't enough, a girl passes by him trying to get his attention (to show that even other girls are into him), so that the main girl can be certain that he's an alpha male, but she still give's him a hard time (because in every romantic movie a guy has to prove himself even beyond the shadow of a doubt that he's the man for a boring girl (the exception is when there are 2 awesome guys fighting for the same girl (Twilight))).<br/><br/>They start talking on the phone and she lends him her favorite book. <br/><br/>The leg cancer guy says that her book is amazing. And since the spoiled brat cancer girl has some stupid question she wants to make to the author, he decides to get them both a trip to Europe to talk to the writer of the book. He could get anything for himself, but he decides to give his special once in a lifetime cancer wish to her, even though they are not boyfriend/girlfriend, they have not had sex, they haven't even kissed yet.<br/><br/>Her doctor is the ugliest actor, so you know he's going to be the bad guy. He tells her that she can't take the trip in any possible way! She goes anyway (obviously).<br/><br/>In the generic romantic European country, the guy decides to use a tux (which all men love to wear... Not!) to take her to a very expensive dinner (which although he doesn't end up having to pay, he was more than happy to be able to pay for her!).<br/><br/>The author seems to be a reasonable guy, he tells them in other words that the book ended the way it should have ended, that her questions are stupid and that she's a spoiled brat/ narcissist (which is all true).<br/><br/>She gets sad, boy comforts her and tells her he could write a better ending then the author (no he couldn't, and if that's the case, why couldn't she? and why did they come in the first place?), they decide to go to Anne Frank's house. She's tired of going upstairs because of her lung cancer. When she's at the place where Anne Frank hid, she kisses the boy. Other tourists who were there clap for the blatant disrespect of Anne's suffering because they're Nazis(it's the only reasonable explanation). This clapping cheers them on to having sex.<br/><br/>At this point me and my girlfriend were discussing going out of the theater before the end, because it was so bad and clichÃ©, but we stayed, just in case the end was amazing to make up for all this bulls...<br/><br/>They go back to America. Guy has cancer again and becomes depressed (He knew it before going to Europe, but only gets depressed about it now, w t f?!). In his depression he stops talking to girl (because romantic movies need a moment of sad separation which can always be easily resolved after some days by talking). He starts talking to girl again... about death. Girl writes eulogy for boy, and reads it to him. Boy dies, it's time for her to read eulogy (I'm thinking: she's obviously not going to read the same thing again, because that would be boring for the audience of the movie) and then she doesn't read it! (what?! who saw that coming except for everyone!?). She decides to say bland feel good lies in his funeral, instead of the truth, because she's a conformist narcissist coward. <br/><br/>Girl gets a paper that leg cancer boy wrote to her before he died. I barely remember, but it's some romantic BS. The end.<br/><br/>There's also a scene I don't remember exactly when in the movie that shows how deep does narcissism goes in the girl: She says that she knows that when she dies, her parents are not going to be able to do anything anymore, shrivel and die, because she's dead. Her parents are like: No, we aren't. Get over yourself.<br/><br/>Highlight of the movie: Another guy plays violin for a short bit of time."
"naxt1114","7","33","58","5 June 2014"," The Fault Is Not in Our Stars, But in Ourselves??
","The Fault in Our Stars was good. It was funny and certainly heart gripping. I thought Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort did a great job. Overall the story itself was magnificent, albeit there were several faults in the film itself.<br/><br/>The editing was awkward at times and there were noticeable contradictory mistakes that I will not dwell on other than to say (without spoiling anything) that there is a teleporting basketball trophy... See if you can spot it!! I also felt that the framing was too narrow at times and some of the two frame shots were unnecessary and distracting. My last and largest problem was that there is a huge difference in what works in a book and what works on film. Some scenes can feel odd â€“ and that is because they are out of place. In addition, the themes could have been much stronger and left us in really thinking. Sadly the film did not quite make it.<br/><br/>I may be focusing too much on the negatives. I did rather enjoy the film and thought the book was fantastic. I would recommend it to anyone contemplating. Enjoy!"
"alexbarnes1129","1","198","405","20 September 2014"," I've never rolled my eyes so much during a movie
","The reason I am rating this a 1 is to combat the insane 8.2 rating that this terrible movie has.<br/><br/>I'm a 17 year old girl, and most people would assume someone my age would fall head over heels for a movie like this. I watched expecting to see this amazingly realistic, incomparable, and tragically beautiful love story, which is how TFIOS had been described to me. After spending two hours watching this movie, I'm sitting here wondering if I'm made of stone considering I did not shed a single tear. But several movies I have watched, and stories I have read, have left me sobbing and attempting to recover for days. I have never read the book, or any of John Green's books for that matter but now I will forever hold the opinion that he is a fully grown man attempting to articulate not only the life of a teenage girl, but the life of someone suffering with a disease. The first few lines of the movie, narrated by Hazel, made me know I was going to hate this movie, since she was describing things that happened in clichÃ© romance stories (which is exactly what this is), and how this was ""true."" The idea that this movie was realistic is ridiculous. First of all, a few token one-liners in the movie were clever and well written, but would never come out of a teenager's mouth. As a teenager myself, I can confirm that we are not that profound. I didn't understand the appeal that either of the main characters had in the other, other than the fact they both had cancer. Hazel was boring, and selfish, and self-pitying, and Gus was so pretentious it made me feel sick, and I never believed for a second that he was a virgin. Of course cancer is a terrible thing, as is death itself, but the fact that I didn't care about either of them, and saw them as a caricature of what John Green thinks or wants teenagers with cancer to act like, made me completely indifferent to their predictable demise. The story line with them going to Amsterdam to visit the author of their favorite book was annoying and unnecessary. Although the author was painted as this terrible person, I actually agreed everything that came out of his mouth about Hazel. I'm pretty sure the whole point of that scene was to say ""hey, what can we do to make this movie even more depressing? I know, let's take the one thing that the main character cares about and destroy it, in order to make her completely dependent on her love interest."" There's too many complaints I have about specific eye-roll inducing lines and scenes in this movie to even remember, but the one that angered me more than anything was when they went to the Anne Frank house. First, they tried to compare the horrible death of Anne Frank and her family, which was an outcome of the most horrible thing that has happened in human history, to these teenagers dying with cancer. As soon as they reached the top floor of the house, paying attention only to Hazel struggling to climb the stairs, in my mind I started thinking ""please make them be respectful. I swear, if Gus tries to crack a self-righteous joke I will punch my laptop screen."" At first, I was pleasantly surprised, because they were quiet and solemn, but then, they begin making out... Only to make it worse, everyone in the room begins clapping. Why? If I was there, I would be furious at their lack of respect. I can only hope this scene wasn't filmed in the actual house. Towards the end I was constantly checking the bar at the bottom of my screen to see how long I had left. I kept thinking, when is this really sad part coming that will make me cry? and when the credits started rolling, I realized it never would. The fact that people are describing this piece of trash as the best movie they have ever seen boggles my mind. I'm assuming it's the first movie they have ever seen. If you want to watch a realistic romance movie, you won't find it here. Don't waste your time."
"khaledalasad","1","151","306","27 July 2014"," I Saved My 1 For This Film
","I honestly can't imagine how anyone with a sense of good writing, good directing, or good acting could ever think this movie is entertaining past the humor of its flaws. Do you people have brains? These actors may as well have had the script in their hands while shooting. It would have made no difference. The only impressive ""skills"" displayed came when the girl cries after AUGUSTUS (so pretentious)passes away. <br/><br/>The only thing that kept me engaged in this movie after I had started watching was the curiosity of which one dies first. There were points when I was rooting for the death of them together just so the movie would end.<br/><br/>This review isn't coming from someone heartless. I admit that I teared up when Hazel bawls her eyes out, but that doesn't make the movie good. That just means I sympathize with someone who is crying. That says nothing about the quality of the film. <br/><br/>What happened IMDb? I can usually trust your ratings. I've never written a review here before but when I saw that this was higher than an 8, I had to say something.<br/><br/>This is a weak tearjerker for the weak-minded."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","52","97","7 June 2014"," The fault is the script
","It is nearly impossible to make a film about terminal illness and not make it heartfelt. The Fault in Our Stars has its heart in the right place but â€“ WOW! â€“ you walk out wishing that someone would shake the dust and clutter and broken fragments off the screenplay so it can flow with more efficiency. Here is a movie that is so busy being profound that the characters feel trapped by plot gimmicks and stale dialogue.<br/><br/>Based on the bestselling book by John Greene, the movie stars the talented Shailene Woodly as Hazel Grace Lancaster, a teenager with Stage 4 thyroid cancer with metastasis forming in her lungs. She's been living with this disease since she was 13, and now she lugs around an oxygen tank with a nasal cannula. Hazel is distant, a bit surly and more than a little bit cynical about the world. In other words, she's a normal teenager. Her parents force her to attend a cancer survivor support group that is led by an overly emotional group leader who begins each session by unrolling a large rug with a big â€“ and somewhat unnerving â€“ picture of Jesus on it.<br/><br/>One day in group she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a fellow teen who confidently announces that he is suffering from osteosarcoma which has already claimed the lower part of his right leg. He's a nice guy that Hazel meet-cutes when she bumps into him in the hallway. There is little resistance from either side as to how they feel about one another and in the blink of an eye, they fall in love.<br/><br/>That's more or less all that you need to know. The connection between Hazel and Augustus is not really built on chemistry but on the fact that they both suffer from terminal illness. The movie doesn't have the flow of real life, but is built on conventions of the plot. Everything in their relationship is calculated for effect, we get gimmicks instead of narrative. For example, Augustus carries around a pack of cigarettes and occasionally puts one in his mouth. Hazel is disgusted but Augustus offers this explanation: ""They don't kill you unless you light them. And I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing. A metaphor."" That's fine, but the sight of Augustus with the cigarette in his mouth looks as ridiculous as it sounds. He puts the unlit cigarette in his mouth so often that we want to take his away from him and say ""STOP THAT!!"" The movie is loaded with strange moments like that. There is an odd subplot about a book that Hazel has read over and over by a mysterious author named Peter Van Haughton who has apparently disappeared into seclusion somewhere in Amsterdam. After a long and pointless series of arguments with doctors and with Hazel's parent, she and Augustus accept an invitation to fly to Amsterdam to meet him. Van Haughton is played in an angry performance by Willem DeFoe that seems shoe-horned in as if he were visiting from a different movie.<br/><br/>Worse is what comes next. Hazel and Augustus visit Anne Frank's house. Naturally, Hazel has trouble climbing the series of steep staircases. When she reaches the famous attic, there is little to no attention paid to the fact that they are in Anne Frank's famous hiding place. Instead, the scene climaxes with Hazel and Augustus's first kiss, to which all the strangers around them begin to applaud.<br/><br/>The movie never really deals with the issue of what it is like to live with cancer, or the inevitability that it will claim your life. The dialogue lightly dances around these issues but no one ever gets serious about discussing them. They know they're going to die but neither Augustus nor Hazel ever get down to the serious business of discussing what lies on the other side. Augustus talks a lot about ""oblivion"", which indicates that he is an atheist, but the movie doesn't go there. We know from the beginning that one or both characters will face the final curtain before the movie is over, but the film's final act is a long â€“ very long â€“ series of slow passages about eulogies and final wishes that goes on and on and on. It should be moving us to tears but you find yourself checking your watch instead.<br/><br/>Hazel informs us in the beginning that ""Pain deserves to be felt."" We agree, but the movie could do with a lot more pain and a lot less catharsis. The characters talk and talk and talk and talk, but nothing they have to say has any real meaning. Death is the inevitability of this story, but there's such a long and drawn-out funerary tone to the film's third act that is tinged with so much hope and finality that it feels like the happiest sad ending you've ever seen."

Have someone on the BIG screen cry for a few minutes... the audience will cry too, of course. It's like the yawning that's contagious... But why was it that I didn't care at all for ANY of the characters, by the end of the movie?... The only moment that was a bit moving was when the girl received the news about his death... But even that wasn't connected emotionally to anything else in the movie... I can list a hundred movies that are WAY more emotional than this pile of artificial cr*p...

"NateWatchesCoolMovies","9","6","8","23 May 2015"," Shailene Woodley gives phenomenal performance in a solid film
","This movie took me by surprise. Usually this kind of young adult fare isn't something I go for.. Too watered down and formulaic. And although this one does sometimes stray into pandering melodrama, it's for the most part made with a blunt, matter of fact clarity and heart wrenching realism that needs to be commended. Shailene Woodley has been on the map for a while now, and although she sometimes phones it in in mediocre projects (cough Divergent cough), she has a magnetic star quality and gravitas that pulls you in. She is unbelievable here, playing a hard luck girl in an agonizing situation that no one should have to go through. There are two scenes that she just nails, and raise her performance to award worthy quality. After seeing her in Descendants, White Bird In A Blizzard and now this, I can say she's a new favourite. Ansel Elgort is charming, life affirming as gives excellent work as a fellow cancer patient who falls madly in love with Woodley's character, Hazel Grace. Old pros Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe are superb in supporting roles. At one point Dern say something like "" It's how people have always dealt with pain... You just do it."" This film takes that simple piece of advice and makes its characters make decisions and act accordingly.. Yes what they are going through is horrible, heartbreaking, tragic stuff, but it doesn't cancel out the fact that you are LIVING through it, and can make the choice to do just that: live with whatever time you have, and deal with it as best you can. This is what sets the film apart from a lot of other films of its type."

","This film is horribly cheesy. Hollywood does cancer very very badly. The male lead could not act and therefore I was not convinced and therefore I did not cry. I cry at everything usually but this film is not convincing at all. It was definitely the male lead that spoilt it for me. I just didn't understand his naked obsession with the female lead. From the minute he sets eyes on her, wham he is in love! I found that very strange, or maybe it was just the way he did it. I know love at first sight happens but this seemed way over the top. If you watch Love Story from the 60's which features cancer, it has an authentic love story and build up but this film does not seem to be that genuine so you don't really care about the characters. To be frank, the whole thing reeks of cheese. Stay away."

","I went into this movie expecting a stupid teenager-drama. I haven't read the book and I'm not really a love story type of guy. And although many people may see it as just that, a stupid teenage love story, I was very positively surprised. It was actually cute and funny, and I really enjoyed it. It might still have a few klischeè teenage movie things, and it might try to be all inspirational, but It felt real and heartfelt. I was also positively surprised by the performances, which were nicely and lovingly done. It was sad but at the same time gave you a warm, chummy feeling. So if you like a good love story that has a little humour to it, but manages to crush you a little as well, I highly recommend this movie."

","I will be the first to say that the book by John Green captivated me. I went to the Chapel Hill Public Library to do some Wojdylo Social Media work and ended up seeing this book on the ""must reads"" shelf right before Christmas. I read the book in about three hours and I knew I had to watch the movie. I went to Twitter and asked my friends their thoughts on the book. They all loved it. I had to wait six months to see the movie.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the book and the movie was outstanding. The one thing I did not like about the movie was the fact that Augustus' prior relationship was never mentioned in the movie. This was one of the main parts of the plot of the book as he did not want to hurt someone else. That did not play out at all in the movie.<br/><br/>Other than that, I felt as if the movie did a great job of telling the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters. There were moments in which there were tears in my eyes and there were moments that I could not help but laugh. I honestly wish I would have read the book closer to the movie release because I forgot some of the amazing lines and the movie did not do them justice. There is just something special about reading that great one liner.<br/><br/>As with most movie adaptations from books, I would strongly suggest reading the book first.

","To anybody to sees The Fault in Our Stars, male or female, be sure to have a tissue handy. I have seen a countless number of films, and I confess this is the film that may have teared me up the most. This realistic story about two teens with cancer coming together is so sweet, but there is also an emotional weight added to the story because of the subject matter. The film doesn't try to be saccharine, but it tries to be sincere. The movie has a light-hearted tone for the most part, despite the dark subject matter and that I can truly be happy with. <br/><br/>Josh Boone's film is about two kids named Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters who fall in love with each other when they meet at a cancer support group. Together they go on adventures with nothing to stop them, not even the Grim Reaper. <br/><br/>The film is truly well-acted. Shailene Woodley deserves an Oscar nomination for this role. Her charisma is inspiring and this may be her best performance to date. Ansel Elgort is not too shabby himself. I loved his quirky personality and despite his problems, still has the ability to keep his witty charm. Nat Wolff was very good as Augustus's friend, who had cancer rob him of his eyesight. Laura Dern turned a sympathetic performance as Hazel's mother and Willem Dafoe gave an hateful, but very good performance as the author who influences Hazel. <br/><br/>Overall, The Fault in Our Stars is an incredible film. It's a very deep, thought-provoking movie It goes in a lot deeper than a normal romance film would do, and that adds more effect to the film. By the time the end credits rolled, my eyes were dripping with tears and to say that's rare while watching a film is an understatement. A powerful, well- meaning story about cancer-stricken teens falling into such a passionate love. <br/><br/>My Grade: A+"

There were a couple scene's where I actually burst into laughter because it was just that stupid.

The acting was good, the story somber, but alright, but the distracting crowd ruined any chance I had of developing feelings for the characters or story. Although I ended up having a great time at the movie, it had to do with my reaction to the crowd and not the film. And now, my experience at opening night of the movie The Fault In Our Stars.... I had read some about it, that it was a popular book, and that the movie was going to be sad, but good. Man....was I ever in for a surprise. So I took my male cousin Robin(both of us in our early 30's), telling him that it was a tear jerker, but that I had heard good things. We arrived to a PACKED theatre. Packed with teenage girls. We found 2 seats finally in the middle of a row. Before the movie started the theatre people gave an announcement that after the film there would be a Q&A with the writer and the 2 lead actors via satellite. The crowd of girls screamed and cheered. Then when the films opening credits started, more screams. We both looked at each other and said ""what the heck did we get ourselves into?"" Then once the lead male came on the screen, it was like we were transported to the 60's at a Beatles concert. Seriously, the girl beside my cousin was actually biting down on her sweater, shaking and squealing. Then every 30 seconds we had to hear ""awwwwwwww"" for every cute look or nice thing the boy said to the female lead. Really, we were annoyed because we felt like we couldn't enjoy the film. Then....................SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>When we learn one of the leads is going to die....the whole theatre started crying...collectively blubbering in unison. Then for the remainder of the film the cries turned to heavy sobbing. Girls clutching tissue boxes and their whole bodies convulsing in lamented moans. And my cousin and I just couldn't keep ourselves together. I felt him choking back laughter and then I was choking back laughter and then we just burst out in gut wrenching laughter. WE JUST COULD NOT STOP LAUGHING! <br/><br/>We tried to make our laugher sound like sobs. People must have thought we were loosing our heads with sadness. But we couldn't help it, it was just TOO FUNNY. We got the heck outta there once the credits rolled. Looking like most of the movie goers...all teary eyed and puffy faces, but our tears were from laughter. I HAVE NEVER LAUGHED SO MUCH AT WHILE WATCHING A SAD MOVIE IN MY LIFE. <br/><br/>I think if u want to bypass the annoying teenage girls, wait till it comes out on DVD.

","When I sat down to watch ""The Fault In Our Stars"", I was worried that it would be nothing but a ""kleenex box flick"". Much like guys can be drawn to the theater with the right quota of explosions, special effects, and superheroes, the same can often be said for women only with really sad stories. That is kind of how this movie is marketed too...as a real tear-jerker. Luckily, the film does enough besides the ""waterworks"" moments to keep your interest throughout. It isn't just all sadness and crying.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a teenager living with a rare form of cancer that makes her (in her own words) a ""ticking time bomb"". At a cancer support group (that Hazel usually loathes, of course), she meets Gus (Ansel Elgort), a fellow youngster who also happens to have a less-severe form of cancer. The two strike up a conversation, which leads to a friendship, which leads to a romance. Through a mutual interest in a mysterious author (played by Willem Dafoe), Hazel, her parents (played by Laura Dern & Sam Trammell), and Gus go off on a ""last wish"" adventure to find this author and have him explain the ending of his most famous book.<br/><br/>I won't go into any spoilers on what makes this movie so ""sad"", but when you consider it is about two kids with cancer, you can probably put two and two together. If you are into emotional speeches and heart-stirring (for better or worse) scenarios, then you will indeed need a tissue box handy. However, even a 28-year old male like me was able to sit through the film without rolling my eyes or tuning out. Though coated with adolescent angst and high-profile teen actors, the kernel of emotion transferred from the core of the story (although I have not read the book, so I can't get into the differences) to the big screen remains poignant.<br/><br/>""The Fault In Out Stars"" probably gets a bit of a ""bum rap"" right now because the general market is so saturated with these types of stories. I kind of compare it to ""The Giver"" in that regard. Yet, one must remember that is was John Green's book that practically STARTED this entire genre; it just took awhile for it to get transferred to Hollywood.<br/><br/>On my personal ranking scale this movie would get a 3.5-star ranking, but I'll bump it up to four stars here because it is a touching story with even a little comedy and light-heartedness thrown into the mix. While the core of the story may be very emotional, it isn't all ""doom and gloom""."

","Take out cancer and they are left with a hollow storyline. The movie is simply not believable to me. I know it is fiction but fiction can be made into a very believable film if it has relatable characters or storyline. Not to mention, I find Gus' character rather simple- minded. Hazel's parents characteristics are contradictory too. They are portrayed to be protective of their daughter's well-being and safety but this conveniently dissipates when Hazel wanted to fly to Amsterdam with Gus. Sorry, I think this is not for a more realistic/mature audience, don't get me wrong, I love romantic films but this is sadly not my cup of tea."

Unfortunately I couldn't see it that way, which has to do with the fact, that this is so by the numbers that it hardly evoked an emotional reaction (once at the airport scene with the father, but several times it was shuddering, because of the sugar overload this has).<br/><br/>I actually was under the impression it was another Nicholas Sparks film/novel this was based on. Not because I read this anywhere, but of how the ""story"" ""developed"". No real surprises here, not even that you get beautiful people looking beautiful, while pretending to be something else (or sick). That wouldn't matter though, because even movie sickness is best portrayed by someone we love to watch, but the fact it lies to itself (""you are a fairy tale/movie"" is what someone should tell the voice over, if it actually helped ... but it won't).<br/><br/>A far better movie on the subject, which actually does evoke emotion if you get on the ride is ""50/50"".

I replied instinctively.<br/><br/>""Yes sir.""<br/><br/>My shoulders fell as I dropped the cup, lid still stoppered, into the pit of complete and utter waste.<br/><br/>Throughout The Fault in Our Stars, a choir of hapless sirens relinquishes groan after moan, highlighting each character's obvious emotions, and inflating the tortuous plod of lack-luster plot.<br/><br/>Anderson Cowan, cohost of the best podcast ever, The Film Vault, said it best when describing, 'the crowd of early-teen females cooing and goo-gooing,' at every emotional turn.<br/><br/>A girl was bawling, crying like an infant in the back of the theater after Gus died. I've never been in a movie where someone subjects everyone else to their weeping.<br/><br/>And hey, more often than not, I've got leaky ducts.<br/><br/>But I sure as hell don't thrust it on others. And I've never been uncontrollably sobbing. Most assuredly I'd make a hasty retreat out the theater.<br/><br/>Okay, enough personal anecdotes. I'll complain about the actual movie now.<br/><br/>This film isn't made for me. Perhaps people who like the book can't help but enjoy the on-screen adaptation. At best, though, educated filmgoers can only qualify it as a 'guilty pleasure.'<br/><br/>The Fault in Our Stars is not a good movie.<br/><br/>I should have known better than to trust a poster title scrawled in a chalkboard font. The use of handwritten script in the lettering of the title has become a staple of the 'Dromantic Quirkedy.' (A dramatic romantic quirky comedy.)<br/><br/>In fact, any theatrical release poster utilizing 'the creative quirky penman theme' with handwritten fonts, doodling on spiral notebook stock, or blackboard sketching is generally a red flag.<br/><br/>I haven't read it, but I didn't appreciate The Fault in Our Stars. It's not okay or mild; it's a poor film. And here's why.<br/><br/>The acting is not great on Ansel Elgort's part. His character, Gus, is overly theatrical; breaking into grandiose soliloquys which are meant to be cute and uplifting. Gus is a bit too romantic; his optimism too paper-thin. His haughty bravado is never convincing, and ultimately serves to detach the viewer. Thereby oftentimes reminding the audience they're watching a motion picture.<br/><br/>Nat Wolff, who plays Isaac, is clearly meant to be 'the funny guy.' Of approximately thirty attempts at humor, his jokes hit home twice for the briefest of chuckles.<br/><br/>A lot of the black humor, such as the jokes about Isaac losing his sight, are just not funny. My God, some of the moments that get the audience roaring with laughter, are actually very tragic and harsh.<br/><br/>Just because something is played for laughs, doesn't make it funny.<br/><br/>When Isaac's feeling up his sexy girlfriend in the parking lot, the timing's so stilted; it's disorienting even discerning what's intended to be funny.<br/><br/>Jokes are measured by the quality of the humor, not by the purity of a writer's intent. <br/><br/>Willem Dafoe's character is somewhat compelling, and I enjoy his off-type performance most.<br/><br/>The confusing scene in Anne Frank's house is contrived and cheesy nonsense. Firstly, it feels (in a misleading manner) like something surreal's happening.<br/><br/>The two American tourists start sawing face in the attic hideaway, and the surrounding European strangers respond with applause?<br/><br/>It's absurd. And silly. Not uplifting.<br/><br/>Laura Dern, as Frannie (Hazel's mother), is a bit of a shmoop.<br/><br/>Dern's usually tough to swallow. Her performances consistently include an odd tic; an overly ambitious facial expression or touches of melodrama (I'm thinking specifically of Blue Velvet).<br/><br/>But in TFIOS, she's just overly soapy. All the mother-daughter bonding moments are painful. And when she shows up wearing the towel, does anybody believe for a second that Frannie had just leapt out the tub?<br/><br/>All I can see is Laura Dern pretending to don a towel.<br/><br/>Shailene Woodley is good, as always. She's best in a very good film, The Spectacular Now, and is one of the redeeming elements of Alexander Payne's dreary snore, The Descendants.<br/><br/>The film leans on the supposition a viewer will feel unquestionable sympathy for Hazel. To be frank, she's quite off-putting and not necessarily likable.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, it's dull and depressing. I marched out the theater feeling unfulfilled, confused and defeated.<br/><br/>The policeman watched as I sauntered out the exit, brandishing his nightstick and releasing a satisfied chuckle. But I'm too wrapped in thought to recognize his villainous ways.<br/><br/>The question I keep asking myself: What's the rub?<br/><br/>My sister read the book, so I asked her.<br/><br/>""What's at stake? What am I supposed to take away from this story?""<br/><br/>""I thought it was nice they got to spend the one night together before he died.""<br/><br/>So there's the selling point: The takeaway is the experience of becoming absorbed and swooning in the romantic notion of romance.<br/><br/>I find zero experiential value in this narrative, since the merit of an unfunny 'Romantic Comedy' supposedly resides in the 'feeling of romance.'<br/><br/>Most men are the same way. It's not a redeeming quality. We don't derive satisfaction from the swooning sensation.<br/><br/>This is why most 'date movies' are bad.<br/><br/>But anybody older than twenty (without nostalgia for the book) will realize this is a sub par film.<br/><br/>Ladies.<br/><br/>Please don't drag your significant other to this movie.<br/><br/>Go see Edge of Tomorrow, 22 Jump Street, Maleficent or How to Train Your Dragon 2 instead.<br/><br/>Way more laughs (and feel-good moments) in all four."

","I've been trying to figure out why this movie is so highly rated, and Not sure why or how anyone could sit through this nonsense. All around horrible acting, and predictable storyline from start to finish . I was tricked into seeing this, and by far, the worst movie I've seen since 2004. Highlights all the narcissism and self entitlement problems females today bring to the world. Princess syndrome at it's worst. Two sick people and a family, and one individual spends the entire time only thinking of herself and what she wants, how these other person can improve her pitiful life while she does nothing to contribute back. Thinking they need her and won't be able to cope or survive without her, come on. Just Terrible, avoid this and movies like that, stop making this unequal nonsense...stop supporting it, but then again, I guess some people really aren't as committed to equality as they claim."
"scottjohnson7896","8","10","19","2 July 2014"," Hurting So Good (Raging FIlm Reviews)
","I was nervous going into The Fault in Our Stars. I really liked the book, although it had been hyped up quite a bit, and I knew that the trailers made the movie look like a cheesy and somewhat ""hip"" adaptation. The movie, however, blew away my doubts and resulted in probably the saddest movie you'll see all year or for quite some time. <br/><br/>For all of you who haven't read the bestseller, The Fault in Our Stars follows Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a young girl suffering from cancer. She is bitter and snarky about her condition. She does not have any apparent friends (her one friend in the novel was cut from the film), and she feels like she is just a ""grenade"" waiting to go off. Her mom (Laura Dern) urges her to go to the group counseling at the local church. This is where she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), the boy who will eventually sweep her off her feet.<br/><br/>From the get-go, it is clear that Woodley shines in her performance. We grow so attached to her by the end of the film. Her performance brings the character from the pages of the book to life. The cancer has made her flawed. Not in the physical sense, but in the fact that she tries to build a shell around her life and is fearful of anybody getting close since she thinks she could die at any time. Her relationship with Augustus is fueled with such great chemistry that you would assume that they were actually a couple. Elgort, who starred with Woodley previously in Divergent is excellent in this as well. He will certainly be making more of a name for himself after this film. Their chemistry helps make the movie—which could come off as just a sucker-punching tear fest—into something where everything happens naturally without making it feel too forced or contrived.<br/><br/>But sadly, not in a disappointing way, the film is still a tear fest. We know we are being set up for a huge emotional climax. We know that the cancer is forever present. We know we are going to cry; yet we go along for the journey because it feels true. With the movie clocking in at slightly over two hours, I did feel that it was long, but never did I not enjoy the ride. Even having read the book, the events of the movie still hit harder than I expected, resulting in multiple occasions of tear-filled eyes. I cannot say the same for the other people in attendance, though, because I heard several sobs from people behind me, and even some lingered into the credits. The movie is an emotional roller coaster right until the very end, so be prepared.<br/><br/>The supporting cast supports the main cast admirably. Dern as Hazel's mother is a heartbreaking and real performance. Her character explains that even if Hazel were to die, she would still be a mother, and man do we lose it. Also supporting is Willem Dafoe, in yet another rough and unpleasant character, as well as Nat Wolff from the Naked Brothers Band who plays the star-crossed lovers' friend. Word has already been spread that he will be starring in another John Green adaptation, Paper Towns, so be on the lookout for that.<br/><br/>In terms of actual filmmaking, there are a couple qualms that need addressing. Near the beginning of the film, the movie appears to be cut together by an editor who lacks any experience at all. I never really address editing in my reviews but there are some exceptionally bad moments in editing and sound editing. Sometimes it feels like the film is turning into an action film with some rather quick cuts that are done just for the sake of getting a different angle.<br/><br/>In the end, The Fault in Our Stars will leave you in tears. It is an emotional journey along with two kids who have cancer and it reminds us to live life to the fullest and to never let the adverse elements in our lives keep us from living the life we want. We, like the characters, get to choose who or what hurts us. So, if you want to let some emotions out, go let this movie hurt you because it hurts so good.<br/><br/>for more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com"
"russell-martin","3","20","44","16 November 2014"," A modern masterpiece? I think not
","Firstly, I must say that I am not a cold hearted person. I love a good weepy film and I was looking forward to a hungover Sunday afternoon cry but instead I was just wanting the film to end. So, what went wrong? I would say that the main reason is that Hazel is just not a likable character. Gus was just about likable but I felt nothing for Hazel, throughout the whole film she seemed cold and distant, something about her just didn't work. I'm not sure if something was lost when it went from book to screen but something happened (or didn't). At 2hrs 6 mins it was just too long..<br/><br/>KISSING IN ANNE FRANKS HOUSE?! What the f....? And then to be clapped for it? What? I almost cheered Willem Defoe's character for attempting to take Hazel down a peg or two which, I may add, was the only good thing to happen during the abysmal Amsterdam part of the film.<br/><br/>This just bored me and the only way it almost got any kind of tears out of me was from me mourning the 2 hours of my precious weekend I just wasted on this tripe.<br/><br/>For those of you who think that this is a modern masterpiece... you really should see a few more films. Even in this Genre alone this film is WAAAAAY down the list of modern masterpieces..."

Everything mentioned in the 1-star reviews is true, i have NO IDEA how this reached 8.7/10. It's unbelievable<br/><br/><ul><li>Terrible, inaccurate story: taking advantage of a 'cancer' and 'dying' story and just using it to carry the whole movie? despicable and disappointing - Terrible acting: corny one-liners that had my stomach turning, i could not handle more than 5 minutes of this. Quoted from another review: ""Augustus carries around a pack of cigarettes and occasionally puts one in his mouth. Hazel is disgusted but Augustus offers this explanation: ""They don't kill you unless you light them. And I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing. A metaphor."" That's fine, but the sight of Augustus with the cigarette in his mouth looks as ridiculous as it sounds. He puts the unlit cigarette in his mouth so often that we want to take his away from him and say ""STOP THAT!!"" The movie is loaded with strange moments like that. "" - Bad camera angles, scripting and jarring pace. Normal scenes are given heavy emphasis and over-emphasised. Nothing feels natural, the chemistry seems forced. Camera angles that linger between the two main actors for what seems achingly ages for what seems hours... I had to look away from the screen they were given so much dead focus</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall 0/10. This just takes the cake. Seriously worst movie i've ever seen and it's made me write up this darn review. If you want quality acting, from real actors and real directors, with real sweet charm, heart, good pacing and film editing, watch Silver Linings Playbook starring Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. An infinite times more believable and lovable than this."

","This one is the best one I've seen in a long time. <br/><br/>The movie was based on a novel written by John Green which was a best-seller. The plot of the movie is exceptionally brilliant and extra-ordinary. <br/><br/>Firstly, I would like to thank the director who directed the movie in a way that totally matched with the writer's thoughts, I believe. Without the eternal connection between the writer & the director, this movie might be a big flop, I don't know! <br/><br/>Secondly, Shailene Woodley who played the character of Hazel Grace Lancaster, was a perfect match for the character. And Ansel Elgort acted tremendously well in his Augustus Waters role. So the casting for the leading roles are perfect match, I must say.<br/><br/>Finally, I recommend everyone to watch this movie because it's a true masterpiece."
"bigbieberbaby","1","18","40","6 November 2014"," Absolute garbage
","Why anyone would care to see this 'play on emotion' junk movie, I have no idea. Full of obvious heart-string pulling scenes fit for 12 year old girls. I wouldn't suggest this garbage be watched by anyone(unless you are that 8-12 year old girl that find badly written scripts 'good'). You get more content from a Maury 'who's my baby daddy' episode. If you find yourself with nothing to do, avoid this movie! Even as a last resort! It would leave you empty inside from the hollow acting, all the way to the bad script and plot scenes. Should you have a daughter that wishes to see this, prevent that from happening at all costs. This will only succeed in diminishing their intellect and giving them a false sense of reality with life and relationships."

","Every girl I know was obsessed with the book. And then the movie. I figured that it had to be good, with such a high score. Makes sense, right? Man, was I surprised. The movie was awful. The majority of the actors weren't at all believable and those who were played annoying and cheesy clichés. Many scenes made no sense and were unrealistic. The whole experience was bad as well. The audience that went to see this film is made up of teenage girls who ignored all the faults in the film and gave it a 10. I hope someone like me is reading reviews here. Then maybe they could avoid ever paying to see this movie. I nearly left the theatre towards the end when pretty much everyone in there started sobbing uncontrollably. It was too cheesy and bad to be at all emotional. There was nothing I took away from this film. I wouldn't recommend seeing it. I was extremely disappointed."

","Well, IMDb please, please, please....I trust your ratings so much so that, every time whether its in Cinema hall or on Netflix or anywhere else, even before renting DVD from red box I always check IMDb ratings before deciding whether to watch or not. When I see 8+ rating. I didn't bother to click few pages to read the user reviews seriously my bad, I wish I would have time to read few pages instead of blindly believing the some paid reviews and paid rating by IMDb.My cousins were pulling and honking car horn waiting outside so I just gave in. Lesson learned. I wont trust on IMDb ratings again. Also, I was not furious on my money or my time being wasted like that, but did anyone ever thought giving 8+ ratings would put this movie in the league of Godfather,The Shawshank Redemption,The Lord of the ring series,Good Fellas, Star wars and likes, its utter disrespect and blasphemous for these great movies to put this good for nothing movie and listed and counted among them. People might be thinking or comment that this reviews comes from insensitive person or I don't have heart. Seriously my cousins and I seriously tried to cry but we all end up laughing along with few other fellow like us and also got the wrath of some bull...teenagers who saw this movie as some sacred text like Bible being translate to movie?<br/><br/>OK, now come to the story our pretty Shailene Woodly got cancer and dying very depressive, but why every time they end up in support group and all the good Christian and the worst of the movie was not her, in fact she save the movie else we all would be out of cinema hall in first 15 minutes, the worst part of the movie was that Chocolate face Ansel Elgort seriously this guy can only be her brother and he should stick to brother's and kind of looks because he is so emotionless even on most emotional scenes. He act like he is acting badly. The cigarette scenes were most terrific. Then comes the author part, seriously! a author of some unknown book are in seclusion and drunkard, he was not John Gresham or Stephen kings or some Pulitzer Prize winner author who hasn't got any good book and now in hiding...Not only that the author has no respect for cancer patients or something like that he was rude, drinking all the time and insult our protagonist. Next comes our 18 years old so called virgin boy had sex where? Well, at Anne Frank memorial and that was highly encouraged by applauding strangers, I mean seriously!!!!How much pain one can bear does this director has any idea? So the worst is not yet over by this time we were so bored but to keep our self busy and in fact start enjoying the comedy, so we start playing games who will die first Elgort or Shailene...so by this time I know so much about script I told them what would going to happen and who will die first and how it ends...surprisingly that's what happen, because the script and screen play was so shallow any 6 years old could predict.<br/><br/>Please, emotions are set aside and reviews of teenagers are one thing, please IMDb remove the 8+ rating and give it a true 2 or at most 3 star ratings and please stop insulting movies with 8+ rating its offensive."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","3","4","22 November 2015"," No fault in Woodley's star-making performance
","""The Fault in Our Stars"" is one of the most talked about films from last year and this over 2-hour-long film won big at several awards shows that were mostly aimed at younger audiences. It is the second directorial effort by Josh Boone and the writing came from the team that worked on ""(500) Days of Summer"". Lead actress is Shailene Woodley and her male co-lead is played by Ansel Elgort. The supporting cast includes Oscar nominees like Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe. This movie is about a woman suffering from cancer, but that's really just the background story. With the Big C always present, we get to watch how she spends her final months with friends and family.<br/><br/>Woodley is truly outstanding in the lead and there is no denying that she easily belongs to the most talented actresses from her age group. She took a break from acting between 2007 and 2011, but returned by holding her own against Hollywood star George Clooney in the Oscar-winning ""The Descendants"" and since then it's been a triumphant walk for her leading several movies. This one here is just another great addition to her résumé. Unfortunately, I am not too big on Ansel Elgort here. There is something pretty off-putting about him on several occasions. I am not sure if it's the way the character was written, his (mediocre) acting or a combination of both. In any case, he looked really weak compared to Woodley and I can't see him carry a movie that runs for over 2 hours and he is in it for 1.5 hours pretty much. I rarely had the impression I was watching a genuine character instead of a performance.<br/><br/>The script is fine for the most part. Sometimes it gets into territory in which it feels it sacrifices realism for a sob story, but that's fine as it only is maybe 2 or 3 times. I think in terms of the subject, this still could have been much more authentically emotional, but what the writers came up with isn't a failure either. I did not know Dafoe was in this film, but I enjoyed his short performance. I honestly did not need the second part of his cameo near the end as it was nowhere near as memorable as his first couple scenes. All in all, I cannot agree with the critics and awards bodies who really loved this movie. Still, I believe this is a decent watch. It's just that I would not put it anywhere near my favorite 2014 movies. My favorite cancer-themed film of all time is still ""A Walk to Remember"". But back to this one: Shailene Woodley is very much outstanding in here. Too bad she is the only real reason to check it out."

","Okay, okay. Before we begin to review this title, let's make it clear that I'm a man. Now, The Fault In Our Stars is a story about a girl name Hazel Grace who has cancer. The movie has a solid ground, and doesn't lose it's main focus. The acting was good, but what shined about the movie was the two main characters roles, they felt very natural as a couple, and when your making a love story it's very good to have natural actors (Unlike Twilight). However, the movie dragged a bit too much, I kept saying to myself ""Okay, when are you going to get to the point?"" But still, this wasn't a big problem once you get to the end. One of the biggest problems were that the director rushed the beginning, already three Minutes through the movie Hazel meets Augustus (Her Boyfriend) than, OH OH! There together, or are they? Wait, yeah there together, Nevermind they broke up. That's how it felt anyway. Also, one thing id like to point out is that the movie is not worth the hype! People are making such a big deal about a movie that from the first place wasn't all that great. Oh, another thing, SPOILER! The way they killed off Augustus was just HORRIBLE! We didn't even get a chance to feel bad for the guy because it was like ""Oh! He died that was unexpected"" Than Hazel crys for about 20 seconds than *Poof* Were at the funeral, than *Poof* were at the End credits. And than you kinda sit there like ""Well, that sucked"" So, anyways. This was my small review, again it's not THAT bad but it can wait until the DVD comes out."

","Not as bad as I expected from the trailer, not as good as I had hoped after seeing the reviews. It's not all that great, but it's not bad either. It's shamelessly, even overly sentimental, totally unsubtle, but hey, it works somewhat most of the time. Probably the biggest reason for this is Shailene Woodley. I remember thinking she was really impressive in The Descendants, even in her limited screen time. Then I saw her in The Spectacular Now, and yes, I became a bigger fan. She's pretty amazing here, an actress completely capable of naturally selling the roles she plays, without making them ever feel artificial or contrived. I wish her a long, very successful career, and when it comes to certain things, she's better than the current it-girl Jennifer Lawrence. Ansel Elgort doesn't fare as well. He has some good scenes, but somehow he just comes across pretty unconvincing."

How many ""eulogy"" scenes does one character need? Good thing Hazel or Gus didn't have a dog or it wouldn't have made it through the movie.<br/><br/>The performances are easier to watch then the subject matter. The young leads will be mentioned in Golden Globe circles. Laura Dern, the second best actor in her family gets better with age. William Dafoe can't be as bad as written. His one sour note performance and implausible popping in as the mail man felt contrived.<br/><br/>A good score and use of the Amsterdam locations lift spirits.<br/><br/>Dealing with cancer, the death of a child, and the loss of a friend are tough subjects to explore. Perhaps the movie is actually soft and romantic compared to the truth. After all as Tom Cruise once said, ""you can't handle the truth""."

This balance is totally lost after about 45 minutes. Anne Frank comes in out of nowhere, just to stir up the emotions a little more. This (along with some other plot twists) came across so insincere, that I decided to leave the theater half an hour before the film ended.<br/><br/>The fact that tear jerking seems to be a higher priority than offering solace and a good movie leaves a bad taste in my mouth."

First, the script: Almost always it's different from the book it's based upon, which is not a bad thing, but here, we have a complete misunderstanding from the script writers. Green constructed his story so beautifully, piece by piece with the precision of a clockwork. All of his work went down the drain. I don't want to go into the details of the story, but if you've read the book, just don't see this film. The casting is a joke. Two perfectly healthy young boy and girl, pretend to be suffering from cancer. Not even their make up is believable. Willian Dafoe even worse of his usual bad self. A disaster. The director is a complete failure, in directing actors, as well as picturing interior, or exterior spaces. Last but not least, the music is so bad, it sounds like a cheap - very cheap - TV series selection. Everything in this film is so bad, I wouldn't know which is worse.

","""The fault in our stars"" is an amazing love story reminding us that it doesn't always end happily ever after. Bringing a movie out of a book is never an easy task, especially not when it's an amazing book like this. Due to this fact I arrived at the theater with some skepticism and concerns. 20 minutes into the movie those thoughts were completely blown away, replaced with only good ones. My reason? The cast. Apart from the mother, who wasn't the mother I had gotten to know in the book, the cast was impeccable. Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, Nat Wolff, Willem Dafoe(even though I'm not a fan in general) all made this movie into what it is. This combined with a fantastic score, and some absolutely beautiful scenes took this movie to different heights than I was able to predict. Astonishing. Making this movie better than the book was a mission impossible, but they sure made a noble attempt. One last shoutout goes to Shailene Woodley who was able to capture the character I grew so fond of in the book perfectly. I rarely use the word perfection but it certainly fits the bill in this particular scenario. To me Shailene, you are Hazel Grace Lancaster."

","I used to be a regular visitor of this site because I would check the ratings to decide whether or not I would watch a movie I don't care to see. This movie is rated well above what it deserves. <br/><br/>It started off nice. I thought it was going to tell a realistic love story. Instead, it gave what it said it wasn't, a fairy tale and a cheesy one at that.<br/><br/>Once you get over the fact that they both have cancer, it really isn't a good movie. It seems like the fact that they are sick is the only thing carrying this movie. <br/><br/>Some scenes were really unnecessary, rushed, drawn out and well...boring. <br/><br/>As the movie went on, I couldn't take it anymore. So, as the lady was trying to help the girl up the ladder, I stopped it and returned it. There wasn't any love chemistry between the two main characters. It's more like they liked each other because of the fact that they are both dying. The chemistry is so forced that it couldn't fool a Disney princess.<br/><br/>I love romance movies but this was a miss. I was expecting a heart melting story considering all of the hype over this movie. <br/><br/>On the bright side it reminds me of the movie ""Remember me"" except that was a better movie."

","What inspired John Green to write his six novels, including ""The Fault in our Stars"", was the suffering he witnessed during his five month stint as a student chaplain in a children's hospital. In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald he explained how this experience shaped his religious and social views: ""I was enrolled in divinity school and thought I was going to become a minister - I'm Episcopalian - but I was disavowed of that notion pretty quickly while working at the hospital."" One lesson he learned was the joy that could be found in a short life, a central theme of this film adaptation. Green has a double major in English and Religious Studies, which helped to develop and sell the novel. It was on the New York Times bestseller list, so the film treatment was inevitable, particularly at a time when young adult books are servicing teenage girls where Hollywood has failed them.<br/><br/>I haven't read the novel but from watching the film and learning about Green's background it is clear there are religious metaphors explored in both texts. This adaptation is about Hazel, a teenage girl who was treated for thyroid cancer as a child and now carries an oxygen tank with her everywhere. Due to the weakness in her lungs, she is bored, alone and prepared to die. In a recovery group, she meets a young man named Augustus who lost one of his legs to cancer and they toy with the idea of a relationship together. Through his religious values Green is using both these characters as a metaphor for Christ's suffering. Christ died at thirty-three, a young age, but the Bible suggests his death helped enrich people's lives. Similarly, one of the key lines of the film is ""pain must be felt"", which stresses the importance of understanding one's preparation for death and also remembering people with fondness once they die.<br/><br/>The title of the story is more ambiguous but also encompasses its own Biblical connotations. The love interest in the film is Augustus, which is a significant name in the Bible. Caesar Augustus, ruler of the Roman Empire, was influential in Christ's birth when he ordered a census be taken for every living person. People had to return to their own towns to be registered, which sent Joseph back to Bethlehem and where Christ would be born. The Star of Bethlehem led people to discover the birth of Christ and later redemptive suffering. Augustus is a Christ-like figure, a star for Hazel, because he helps her discover the beauty in pain by adding love and joy to her life in spite of the inevitability of their deaths. <br/><br/>An early scene in the film pokes fun at some of these ideas, with the recovery group being organised by a religious man who lays out a mat with a picture of Jesus on it. The scene is funny and cynical because it's easy to scoff at him when seeing what the kids have been through. The first shot of Augustus' titanium leg gives a frightful jolt. It's one of the film's few real moments. Yet these same religious undertones in Green's book must have impressed a lot of people. Green is part of the Episcopal Church, a denomination of Christianity, which would have added to the novel's bankability. Through Twilight Stephenie Meyer transformed conservative religious values into a rich commodity and Mormonism was suddenly cool again. <br/><br/>In the wake of Twilight's conservatism, it is a shame that this fascinating material has been given such a risk-averse treatment. The director was Josh Boone, whose only other feature was Stuck in Love. His direction lacks creativity and the film suffers from it's over length. The camera-work is largely static and few staging directions have been given to the actors, who are either standing stationary or sitting down. The best choice he makes is planting the camera in tight close-ups on Hazel's face. She's played by Shailene Woodley (The Descendants, Divergent), a gifted young actress who raises the material because of the natural expressions she discovers on her brow. During an early group meeting, she shows her discomfort with Augustus looking at her only through her expressions, no words. Conversely, Boone lets the co-lead Ansel Elgort overact with a theatrical style of acting and such overt niceness that it lessens the believability of his near-perfect character. <br/><br/>Some of the blame should fall on the source material and the film's screenwriters. Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber wrote The Spectacular Now, but their script is sorely lacking in conflict between the leads. Augustus and Hazel's pleasantries drain the film of any tension. They're better conservationalists than Bella and Edward, discussing the inevitability of oblivion, but the plotting around them is dull and increasingly episodic like book chapters. Too little is also made of the adult characters, with Laura Dern given a terribly underwritten role as Hazel's mother. More conflict could have been generated through the desires of both sets of parents. Twilight was foremost about chastity but hid it well under the vampire genre. This film suffers a similar fate: it is about dying, grief and remembrance but spends considerably more time on whether Hazel and Augustus should date or not and swanning around Amsterdam. It is an injustice to Green's experiences because he saw real suffering, which doesn't translate here nearly as strongly as it should."

","I strongly dislike this movie. The love story physically makes me Ill! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone (unless you are a desperate and sappy teenager) It is based on an extremely unlikely romance between two young teenagers who obviously only like each other because they come from similarly rough backgrounds, and are so desperate to have a relationship that they start seeing the first person they bump into. In all fairness, I did find the acting in this moving (particularly from hazel) quite good. Her pain when gus dies is quite convincing. But unfortunately, good acting in one scene is not enough, and this movie (and book) turned out to be a complete waste of time. Please don't put yourself through the pain of watching it."
"SnoopyStyle","6","4","7","16 October 2014"," The Star is Shailene Woodley
","Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) is tired of her parents (Laura Dern, Sam Trammell)'s help and the support of the support groups. The doctor diagnose her as depressed. That is until she meets Augustus (Ansel Elgort) at a support group meeting. He's a one-legged cancer survivor who share the same view of life. Hazel gives Augustus a book 'An Imperial Affliction' written by Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) to read. Van Houten invites them to visit him in Amsterdam, but the meeting doesn't turn out the way they hoped.<br/><br/>This is a perfectly OK teen melodrama with a great performance from Shailene Woodley. She nails this character through the ups and downs. Her scene with Willem Dafoe in Amsterdam is terrific. She doesn't just hold her own but she comes out on top. Ansel Elgort is too one dimensional. I think that has a lot to do with the writing. He is all sugary charms. Even his bad driving is engineered to endear him to the audience. He's not a real person but rather a manufactured character.<br/><br/>This movie could do with some swearing. This is where the MPAA rating system really screws with a movie. It's a movie that needs the PG rating. As such, bad language that would fit these characters' situation is just gone. One would expect these characters to have the gallows humor and the swear words to match. I guess there isn't much the filmmakers can truly do about it. One scene that encapsulates the movie for me is the kiss in Anne Frank's house. As the kiss develops, I thought that this is going to be awkward. Once they start kissing, the scene actually is touching. It works and then everybody starts clapping. It becomes over-written. It's a movie with a great young star that is trying to do something interesting but just tries too hard with its writing."

The acting was really good, but unlike every other viewer, this movie did not touch me as it did others. It was not sad until the end, but it still did not rock me or make me cry.

","One of the best things about TFIOS was the voice of Hazel. It put a great, creative spin on an otherwise common disease story. We don't entirely lose it here. It's in the narration, and in her speech. Some of the book's whimsy comes out with cute choices like placing text messages into speech bubbles above the characters' heads in the book's font. But...from the beginning, we lose the Hazel's wry commentary, and the movie treats the kids' diseases as the most pressing issues, rather than their mental grappling with them. When Augustus is introduced, he is practically stalkerish in his attention toward Hazel, which is forgivable only because of his cuteness. From here on in, it's all twee cuteness. Augustus is a wonderful, but impossibly movie-like boyfriend who would probably get on your nerves in real life, and would also probably be hiding a terrible secret. The movie is not as pressing as the book when we go to Amsterdam to meet the author that inspires her. There's very little urgency or conflict. The movie delivers sweetness and young love, and it truly is sweet, but at times it loses the flavor of the book. I will also say the wardrobe and art direction are terrible, and that I'm not sold on Shailene Woodley's star quality. Even though her man has one leg, it still seems he could do better. I'm knocking this movie a lot, but I will recommend. The preview audience seemed to laugh and cry in all the right places."

How on Earth does the guy fall in love with that? Totally incredible. Never mind, the guy is better looking than her, but his looks still don't warrant a main starring role in a movie. Why does Hollywood not hire beautiful people, so that we actually may enjoy watching eye candy as the love story, comedy or drama enfolds?<br/><br/>The scene in the Anne frank house is ridiculous. Two people with cancer on a holiday 5000 miles away from home, are going to waste their precious time, in a dismal location like that. Let Hollywood remind us for the billionth time about the jews and ww2 and the Nazis - even if it has to be jarred into a romantic film. If the pretentious girl had any inkling of real intellect, and hadn't been nurtured in her sick narcissistic ill natured-ness, she might have actually managed to go out and do something enjoyable and more out of the ordinary, rather than the obligatory US tourist Anne Frank house visit. She's as dumb as the typical sheep who can't think for themselves and simply follow the herd. Yet she goes about thinking she's so above it all. Awful smug wench, she is.<br/><br/>Avoid this film if you're allergic to ugly people playing leading roles in ""romantic"" films that have no other effect than making you depressed."

However, I think people who would back any ""indie"" film and attack the ones disagreeing as shallow and ignorant are equally annoying. I don't think there's any superiority in genre. And concluding ""you must be one of those that love Transformers"" is a pretty weak arguing point.<br/><br/>Anyway, rants aside, I think this movie is extremely childish and unrealistic. The story kinda parallels Twilight and 50 Shades, only it made the fantasy ride on a tragedy to seem more deep and mature. It really makes me wonder how much the authors of these books experienced in life to have came up such unrealistic crap.<br/><br/>Terminal cancer patients don't behave or look like this. Oh gosh this is so disturbing to me... Couldn't they have picked somebody else for the actors? Cancer patients don't look this healthy.

I guess his shin was just too bulky to make it look like it was just a stick underneath the pants.<br/><br/>Haley's character was really unlikable. The girl had more negativity and aloofness than Bella from Twilight, plus she liked to get all deep and talk about some philosophy that the pretentious teenagers love. I was totally wondering where Gus got all that stuff he talked about in his final love letter. How did you see this girl as all those good qualities anyway? I had minimal impression of her being smart or caring.<br/><br/>Gus was unreal. The philosophy was incredibly naive and pretentious. His way of dealing with things were childish. The way people responded weren't much real either. I mean, you give THAT speech at a middle aged lady and she LETS you throw eggs at her car and house? And all that applauding when they kissed? I'm surprised they even let Haley continue climbing. And yeah, a virgin that's about to die has that much confidence in landing girls who don't even want to talk, huh? Also, even putting the character aside, the actor had very bad acting skills for a lead.<br/><br/>This movie makes no sense. Was it written by a 15 year old? I can forgive someone that age for thinking this is good philosophy and realistic love and a good story.<br/><br/>Oh wait the movie wasn't all naive and pretentious. The writer was a character with some dimensions, and the writer had a good point. But they made the writer such an asshole that it was impossible to redeem him or explain his reason in the end.<br/><br/>In all, just a very naive and unrealistic movie with pretentious philosophies and childish fantasies."

","More likely backed-up by best-selling novel from John Green, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is an honest yet faithful love story which containing some positive messages to inspire teenagers. The plot flows as a good drama should be, thanks to screenwriter Scott Neustadter and Michael H Weber who finely adapt John Green's genius idea into a soulful play and beautiful drama. The script for two central characters, Hazel Grace and Gus are well developed. It really shows how Hazel's feeling to Gus grows as much time they've spent together and how they need each other to live despite their imperfect conditions. Besides that, the movie seems taking advantages from Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort's chemistry who easily makes an adorable couple and put some sweet moments from it. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" isn't without it's faults. The other characters beside Hazel and Gus may only just supplement, seems unimportant and sometimes annoying like Van Houten character who looks stupid with his strange behavior and builds an awkward scene every time he appears. Also the film emphasizes more on meeting true love rather than people's attempt on surviving from cancer that makes it missing some points. Don't expect the drama would be as complex as ""50/50"" or ""Dallas Buyers Club"", because what ""The Fault in Our Stars"" offers is much focus on couple dating and having romantic dinner. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is an average good and sweet drama supported by lovely performances from it's two impeccable stars. But nothing much you could get in it that makes this movie felt just enough on being okay."

","This reviews contains LOTS of spoilers, if you are not wanting the movie to be completely given away, please find a different review. <br/><br/>Meet Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 17 year old girl with lung cancer. Meet Augustas, Hazel Grace's boyfriend, who also has cancer. The movie isn't exactly slow, it just doesn't pick up until the middle because of the character introductions. When Hazel was diagnosed at the age of thirteen, she was granted one wish, and she used it to go to Disney Land and Epcot Center. Gus, however, saved his wish. Hazel wants to meet the Author of her favourite book, who happens to live in Amsterdam. Well, after a few set backs, Hazel her mom and Gus are on their way to meet this Author. The Author even pays for a very nice dinner date for Hazel and Augustas, where they drink champagne and discuss philosophy. Oh, and fall in love. You see, Hazel is dying and because of this she doesn't want to love anyone extra who will be hurt by her passing. What Gus doesn't tell Hazel, is that he too is dying and that the cancer has spread to the lining of all his major organs, lungs, liver, stomach, etc. then they make out after dinner (or at least mostly do). When they meet the Author he turns out to be a grieving drunk who lost his daughter at the age of eight to leukemia. He tells them about greater and smaller infinities and Swedish Hip Hop. When all dying Hazel wants is the answer to three characters who are left behind when Anna, the main character, dies. Naturally, Hazel and Gus become mad at the Author because they wasted Gus' Wish on the Author and he didn't even grant the Wish: tell them about the characters who were left behind. Disappointed, they tour the Anne Frank house. It has two flights of steep stairs and a ladder, to get to the top, where they lived. Then they return home and resume their everyday lives and continue their fights with cancer. <br/><br/>Traditional Romeo and Juliet story: he even dies first. <br/><br/>There are a LOT of factual errors, my sister and I finally just started sitting there counting them all. The Anne Frank house has two steep stair cases and a ladder. Hazel is a very stubborn girl, (in the movie Hazel carries her own tank up both flights of stairs and the ladder, with a little assistance from the Author's Assisant), but in all reality Gus should've carried the O2 tank and passed it over Hazel's shoulder up to the Author's assistant and she carried it the other half of the way. Repeating the process for each case. When Gus is diagnosed with the relapse and he becomes so weak that he is in a wheelchair, he should've also been placed on oxygen because by that point the cancer was in his lungs and he was down to less than 30% capacity. And another thing, Hazel has been on oxygen for a number of months (minimally) and has no indignation from the candela pressing on her cheeks, or dryness around her nose and cheeks from the constant air pressure. And lastly, towards the end, where Hazel and Gus are both weak from the cancer taking over their vital organs, they decide to go out to a park not terribly far, but far enough, from Gus' house. And have one last picnic date. Hazel pushes Gus (theoretically she'd be pushed over 240 lbs. and pulling another 25-30 behind her) over uneven ground, and up a small incline. I would be winded and she barely pauses before they start talking and drinking more champagne. It's never said where an 18 year old and a 17 year old precursor a bottle of very nice champagne from. <br/><br/>The only redeeming points in the movie are that their older, not your usual 15 year olds. And that they dress up very nicely when doing grown up activities, not overly mature, just enough. And that they actually come across as mature, not whiny little children. <br/><br/>They think a lot about death and how their going to die before they can do anything in life. But what is keeping any of us live until we're old? And of us could get in our cars today and die a million different ways. There isn't anything different about living life with a terminal illness and dying anyway. I say enjoy today and live for tomorrow. None of are guaranteed a ripe old age. And you don't want to be remembered as then person who only thought about dying and forgot they're living!"

","I'm gonna be real, I don't watch many romantic movies so I'm not an expert in the Romance genre. I gave this movie 3 stars for argument's sake, I don't wanna be completely biased when I knew what I was getting myself into. That being said...<br/><br/>This movie was all the rage when it came out and my friends were peer pressuring me to go see it so we did. I honestly couldn't care less whether Hazel lived or died or her whole ordeal (as cold-hearted as that may sound) because she's an obnoxious, selfish, self-centered spoiled brat. She goes as far as telling her parents she knows they won't get over her probable death and basically their whole lives would be over, to which they basically replied ""nah mate we cool"" (understandably so). I also don't think cancer patients look that healthy or athletic (ie Gus), but what do I know? The only character that I felt was in touch with reality is the writer, but of course angsty teen princess Hazel wants none of this BS. How dare he tell her to get over herself?! I don't even wanna touch the scene where they go to Anne Frank House, because it'll make me reconsider my 3 stars rating and I'm struggling to keep an open mind about this movie. I really am. <br/><br/>If a movie about a bunch of spoiled brats is supposed to make us sympathize with them just because they have cancer, then I guess I'm cold as ice."

You will get that point if you are living in an actual world and not in the make believe world of Hollywood. <br/><br/>The trailers I watched which made me compelled to see this movie are way better and interesting than the movie itself!

","For the type of movie this is, it's not half bad. Slow moving at times and some the the dialogue doesn't ring true. Sad tale of two young people who have cancer....not a comedy for sure. Depressing in fact. Well acted by the leads and especially Laura Dern as the mother. Wonderful performance and wanted to see more of her.<br/><br/>As a realist and difficult to take 'theatrical' license, I'm wondering how Gus and Issac got to that church toward the end. Issac is blind and Gus is dying and in a wheel chair. How in the world did the get to and from the church??? Would have been more realistic if one of Gus' parents had been sitting in the back somewhere. Then you'd know how the two boys got there. Also, at the end when the mother tells Hazel that someone is here to see you. It's Issac. How did he get to the house. Just little quibbles like this kind of spoil the whole thing."

","Somehow, this unabashedly manipulative film has become a runaway financial success, and I have to say I don't get it. All of the characters are nothing more than quick sketches that are never fleshed out, right down to the main romantic couple. Heck, even the characters from the blandest dime-a-dozen big-budget action film you can think of have more dimension and personality than the ones paraded across the screen here. <br/><br/>Make no mistake: This movie's screenwriters didn't set out to write a story about Hazel and Gus. No, they set out to write an Emotional movie with a capital ""E."" I have nothing against those movies; as a matter of fact, I absolutely eat them up. But the thing is, in order to be effective, you need characters that people care about and identify with, not cardboard cutouts with about as much depth as a single sheet of paper."

However, I couldn't really connect to the characters. I don't understand why people were crying at the end. I didn't. I felt little connection to the characters.

Maybe I just was mentally prepared for it to happen and that's why I wasn't so shocked. I just didn't like it..

","Over the last couple of decades, terminal-disease-at-youthful-romances are dime-a-dozen in the proliferated Korean flick market, escalating audience symptoms from indigestion to constipation. ""The fault in our stars"", you probably have heard, despite the subject matter, is not one of those.<br/><br/>There is one very interesting quote (the circumstances for which are incidental and omitted here): between the 3 of us, we have 5 legs, 4 eyes and 2.5 pair of lungs. The three people are the protagonists Gus (Ansel Elgort, with a smile that wins all), Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus's delightful sidekick Isaac (Nat Wolff, equally delightful), all cancer patients. Gus had one leg amputated from just above the knee; Hazel for all intents and purposes has a plastic oxygen tube anchored to her nostrils all the time (oxygen supplied by a portable cylinder she drags around); Isaac had lost his left eye at the beginning of the movie and then loses the right in the middle of it. Gus has been free from a relapse for a few years; Hazel's situation is ""stable""; while sacrificing both eyes appeared to have preserved Issac's life. But unfortunately, as we all know, nothing is really certain in the fantastic realm of cancer-land.<br/><br/>Gus and Hazel meet at a cancer support group and eventually fall in love. This is not something new to the cinematic world so I won't elaborate the details. One thing I want to say is Woodley and Elgort have set a new bar for the meaning of ""chemistry"" in acting together. Separately, they are equally superb. On Hazel's side, another wonderful dimension is in Laura Dern's top-notch portrayal of Hazel's mother Frannie. While this is not a particularly manipulated tearjerker, tear will flow, even more so in the mother-daughter scenes than the lovers' scenes.<br/><br/>(additional SPOILER warning)<br/><br/>What makes this movie stand out, however, is the reality and cruelty it does not hold back from depicting. A lot of movies with a similar theme would have as the focal point a ""last wish"" sort of scenario, unabashedly manipulated to give an uplifting conclusion. In ""faults"", Hazel has a dream which Gus and Frannie help to realize â€“ to visit an author named Van Houten (a brilliantly casted Willem Dafoe) in Amsterdam. Hazel, in her sickness, clings to a book by Van Houten about a girl who eventually died of cancer. What Hazel (and Gus also) wants to do is ask Van Houten face-to-face when happened to the rest of the people surrounding the girl after her death. To cut a long story short, the three have a dream-like trip to Amsterdam where the young couple is treated to a romantic dinner by the author before the fateful visit the next day. This is where the movie shines: a rude awakening that all these nice correspondence and gestures are offered only by the author's kind-hearted mate. Van Houten turns out to be an obnoxious, ultra-cynical drunk, to such an extent of extracting from our lovely heroine the only four-letter word that appears in the entire movie.<br/><br/>All these happen only in the middle of the movie. Ironically, this ""common enemy"" becomes a trigger for the young couple to let go of all their inhibitions and let their love flow. The rest of the movie follows a somewhat familiar trajectory. There is a plot twist which may be unfamiliar to some but I, for one, have seen it elsewhere.<br/><br/>Doubtless, there will be discussions emerging from the theatre surrounding thing such as what makes Hazel and Gus tick, is Van Houton truly a villain or just a realistic depiction of a normal human being etc etc. But one thing is certain: you would want to see more of Shailene Woodley's movies, the ""Divergent"" series aside. Something Oscar-worthy."

The film is an extremely romanticized version of reality and takes on a cathartic display which was supposed to evoke a few tears but ended up doing the opposite(yes,I had a few laughs there). This film in my view is cancer for young minds which inspires you to hold onto fallen ideals. This film is strictly for those with the 'bleeding heart syndrome' very aptly put by the highly revered 'most watched leading man in television history'.<br/><br/>The 'metaphor' is strictly a test of your coherence - cigarette in mouth without lighting it up is supposed to be funny or cool or whatever.The film invites ridicule and a certain farcical exuberance could never hurt the creators, but certainly does to the viewers.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely aspires to be like its idol a paragon of self pity , yeah you guessed it right 'NICHOLAS SPARKS'.(as if one was not enough) <br/><br/>The only character I liked in the film was that of the author brooding,aloof,misanthropic but ruins it all when he shows up at the funeral with a letter in tow.<br/><br/>This film has nothing new to offer and is as cheesy as ... well cheese and the fact that this movie will have a bollywood remake .... yeah I saw this coming.<br/><br/>I would like to believe that I have given you a fairly ingenious outline as to what this movie brings to the fore."

It just could have been so much more, with long scenes of seemingly irrelevant conversations and little about them. I felt that I didn't really know either of them at the end and it was all just a huge disappointment. It is a typical Hollywood conversion of a good book into an innocuous film.

Hollywood had banalized and trivialized the topic, there is a movie almost every year about it, that the people just adore 'em. The industry must look for other ways to show to the common people how hard is the whole topic; The avant- garde films about the topic are not as recognized as they would be (La guerre est dÃ©clarÃ©Ã©, or maybe even 50/50 that took the whole drama of the illness with a grown-up patient).

","I saw the trailer for this movie, obviously it was marketed as a big tearjerker movie, the title comes from a quote from Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare, ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, for we are underlings"", it basically means that the fault is in the lead characters stars, I hoped for something worth my time. Basically teenager Hazel Grace Lancaster (Divergent's Shailene Woodley) lives in Indianapolis, she has terminal thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs. Her mother Frannie (Laura Dern) believing her to be depressed urges to attend a weekly cancer patient support group to make friends with people going through the same thing. There Hazel meets charging teenager Augustus ""Gus"" Waters (Baby Driver's Ansel Elgort), he lost his leg from bone cancer, but has since apparently been cancer-free, they bond at his house over their hobbies. They both agree to read each other's favourite book, Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels her experience, and Augustus gives Hazel Counter Insurgence. They keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer, Gus expresses frustration when finishing the book, having an abrupt ending (it ends in the middle of a sentence), Hazel tells that the mysterious author Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) retreated to Amsterdam after the book's publication, he has not been heard from since. Weeks later, Gus tells Hazel he has traced Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij (Lotte Verbeek), Hazel corresponds with Van Houten by email, she writes wanting to find out more about the novel's ambiguous ending, Van Houten replies that he is only willing to answer her questions in person. Hazel asks her mother if she can travel to Amsterdam to visit him, but Frannie refuses because of financial and medical difficulties, Gus suggests she uses her Make-A-Wish Foundation ""cancer wish"", but she has already used it to go to Disney World. Gus and Hazel go on a picnic date and begin to fall in love, he surprises her with tickets to Amsterdam, there is a medical setback, but Hazel's doctors allow the trip, they expect that she will soon become incapable of doing anything at all. Hazel and Gus arrive in Amsterdam, they have reservations at an expensive restaurant, paid for by Van Houten, during the meal, Gus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they meet Van Houten at his house, but are shocked to find he is an alcoholic, Lidewij paid for the trip and the dinner without his knowledge, angered he taunts Hazel for seeking answers, and belittles her medical condition. Hazel leaves, utterly distraught, Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience, the three visit the Anne Frank Museum, where Hazel struggles up the stairs. Gus and Hazel spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time, the next day Gus tells her that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal, Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be. Returning to Indianapolis, Gus' health worsens, he is taken to the ICU and realizes he is close to death. Gus invites his blind best friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they deliver eulogies that they have both prepared, Hazel tells him she would not trade their short time together for anything. Gus dies eight days later, Hazel is astonished to see Van Houten at the funeral, he tells her that Gus had demanded he attend his funeral to make up for the spoiled trip. Van Houten tells her that his novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna, who died at a young age from leukemia, he gives a piece of paper, she screws it up and asks him to leave. Later, talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Gus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her, she retrieves the screwed-up paper, it is Gus writing about accepting his death and about his love for her. She lies on her back on her lawn looking up at the stars, smiling as she remembers Augustus and says: ""Okay"", they're special way of saying ""I love you"". Also starring True Blood's Sam Trammell as Michael Lancaster, Ana Dela Cruz as Dr. Maria, Randy Kovitz as Dr. Simmons, David Whalen as Gus' Dad and Milica Govich as Gus' Mom. Woodley gives a charming performance, whilst constantly wearing the breathing tubes, Elgort is endearing despite some cheesy dialogue, they are a believable doomed couple, obviously it is full of sentimentality and mushiness, and manipulative bits that try to draw tears, but it is also witty and amusing in the right places, it's not a bad romantic drama.

"RageReviewer","3","2","3","20 June 2015"," ""Best Romance Move of the Decade"" my foot.
","To explain: I'm not a big fan of romance movies or even romantic comedy movies. If you're going to create one though, you better do it right. This movie is labeled a romantic comedy-drama, which is false. It's more drama than comedy and it's because of the cancer. Oh but it is not the cancer you think of: it's the crappy displays of character that are cancerous.<br/><br/>What do I mean? The main character, Hazel Grace Lancaster (very white name by the way) believes that her fate is inevitable, as she will die of her thyroid cancer. Boring. That's when everything changes when the plot device (no seriously, that's what the book calls him), known as Augustus ""Gus"" Waters (also a very white sounding name) comes in and have her live for the moment. More Boring. Okay, names aside, these two aren't very interesting to begin with, because they sound as depressed as the role they portray. Hazel sounds like a typical teenager rather than the college student she claims she is, and Gus is as pretentious as they come. On top of that, they are supposed to be head-over-heels because they both have cancer? That's even more depressing! <br/><br/>Some other glaring problems: the parents are perfectly okay with having this ""friend"" come with them to Amsterdam (most parents would shout ""OH HELL NO"", even if the trip is complimentary), the Anne Frank scene was way out of place. It made absolutely no sense to hold a ""big moment"" in there. Kind of a middle finger to Anne Frank if you ask me.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this whole film, however, is the subplot with the author. Oh my god. This guy is a complete waste of time and energy, for both the characters and the audience. First of all you have him portrayed by Willem Dafoe, which was really out of place. Also, another alcoholic author? Did Stephen King secretly write this script? But by far the most insulting thing to come out of his mouth, as a middle finger to this movie and to the audience, was his mentioning of the Trolley Effect. If you don't know it look it up and you'll see what I mean. <br/><br/>Altogether, this movie I saw because it was a date. We both agreed to not see it again because there was plenty wrong with it to not be willing. I give it a three because there are a few moments that are genuine because I will admit, there is some chemistry, it's just not that good. There's even one funny moment, where the blind guy is egging the car, but it's definitely not enough to save this movie."

","First of all, I'm sorry I watched it pretty late.<br/><br/>I don't think most of us have had the heart, and the courage, to see what this really was. No, this was not an over-sentimental, full-of-tears-and-sadness drama. It wasn't even a pure insight into the lives of the afflicted. It wasn't even an adaptation of Green's novel. It was only the pinching, romantic and delicate imagery I've always had from listening to Wait (M83) and its Kygo remix. By the way I'm not adulterating my every-day's empirical observations and imaginations for the sake of this review. Check my SoundCloud account if you've any suspicions. For those of you who actually did, see? I don't lie. Neither does my review.<br/><br/>So that's the bottom-line: If Wait wasn't in the movie, this might have been six star movie for me. But because Wait is used, and in the exact places as it should have been, I'll give a maximum, not that anybody gives a cuss, but then see, the movie isn't made for getting cusses. It's made for ""assimilators"" (not a word) like me, who desperately long for content that actually is an honest-to-god discernment of what some lives may be like, and those lives may not be notably similar. I mean I don't have cancer, but something relatable to it.<br/><br/>By the way Willem Dafoe was the best of all of them. The scene where he is first shown is absolutely beautiful, and really adds to the ""8"" I've given. His character of Gus Van Houden could not have been exploited the way Willem did. I mean the guy's a natural. He looked a sociopath, and intellectually overdosed freak. And when he said, ""Lidewij, play Bomfalleralla,"" ah man, I was practically hoping with the song that followed. The production is of course by Alfasy & Filthy, but its usage here in Th Fault in Our Stars provided it the vigor and intensity. Gus Van Houden was a total mess, and that messiness is what I like. Irregular is the new regular. <br/><br/>John Green's work reached its visualization, and I am not disappointed. It was good, and stick-able because of its eventual sentimentalism, which is the case with most viewers. But with that, I think Green's original work had much more maturity, grip with situation, and smoothness. Everything was too amateurish in the movie, and looked more like a college-typo. Anyways, worked for me; I rarely look for beyond-the-general-standard product when it comes to romance."

","I wanted to really love this movie, I heard people rave about it. It's good, not great in my opinion. It is a touching love story but overall a bit too contrived. I mean, we know from practically minute one that someone will die by the end. I thought the Europe trip was sweet and lovely. Oh and I loved the soundtrack too--thought the songs used were beautiful. But I can't get over certain parts of this movie that were just weird/strange/over-the-top. First, as others have pointed out the scene in the Anne Frank house where Gus and Hazel kiss for the first time and everyone claps. Oh my gosh, really??? I actually said that out loud to my friend while watching this. Come on, how on earth do total strangers know (or care, even) that that's their first kiss??? I'm still shaking my head at that part. And the writer they visit because they love his book so much. I don't really know what was the point of that subplot. It goes nowhere because the writer is rude to them, then they all start yelling and Gus & Hazel leave. What? They accomplish nothing. And speaking of the writer--I'm so tired of the stereotype that artists/writers/etc are depressed, MAJOR loners, dependant on alcohol or drugs and are just plain weird. I'm a visual artist and I don't appreciate this crazy stereotype. You could tell from practically the instant Gus and Hazel meet the writer at his home that it's not going to go well. And how he randomly shows up at the funereal is just weird and creepy. I mean, he came all the way from Europe, who would do that?? Of course he tries to be nice to Hazel and explain stuff and she just screams at him. Again, nothing is accomplished with this scene. What's the point? I know he gives her the letter but still--could have been a better & more believable scene. And the last scene I can't get my head around is the part where they show up (in broad daylight!!!) to throw eggs at the (gorgeous green!) car of the one guy's ex. Seriously--this part bothers me to no end. The woman comes out of the house, sees the eggy car and-- just GOES BACK INSIDE??!!!! Ummmm, what about calling the cops or at least threatening to?? Especially after Gus tells her this is basically revenge. The kids don't seem to get in the slightest trouble at all for doing this to the (beautiful green!) car.

","When I see a movie so grossly over rated, it makes me remove some points from my actual score. This is to me a 6. But at 8.2, this movie is way over what it should be. But I understand perfectly why so many people were moved by it. And it what I want to discuss here. ATTENTION SPOILER. When the protagonists go to Amsterdam, as if it was the place where they would find the answer to the ultimate question in their lives, the character played by Wilem Dafoe tells them basically that they are not special because they have a terminal illness, but that they are like all other human being faced with the hand they were dealt by life. I suspect the author of the best selling novel to have used this character to expose this truth which is hard to accept. But with appropriate music and endearing moments, we forget that unpleasant encounter until this character comes back to tell us he lost a loved one to terminal disease. As for the actors, only Shailene Woodley does her job. The sloppy acting that surrounds her is a little irritating."

","Everything about this flick sounds phony, from the dialogs to the reactions of all the people involved. For instance, what kind of a love approach is this ? Don't underline all the time that they are talking about this particular book. What amazed me was the mother in front of her sick child saying ""I will never be a mother again"". What mother would be so selfish in a situation like this ? Evry mother would, first thing first, think about her child. That quote ruined the moment and the mother's every appearances. Te father is there, but absent. Both parents spent their time running in the stairs with a would be sad face. The worst part is that I never felt emotionally connected to the characters besides at the very end. The movie is supposed to be funny at times but with the kind of goody Christian jokes. Good story with a bad scenario. It could have been done with less pathos, less clichés and... less music which is redundant with the emotions."
"blott2319-1","6","1","1","30 April 2020"," Not entirely cliche, but also not entirely enjoyable
","I think most people have heard enough about The Fault in Our Stars to know what they are getting into. So, making complaints about the way it manipulated me emotionally seems a bit foolish. Yes, it is a tearjerker, much like any movie that deals with cancer and death. I expected to cry a number of times with this film, and I did. That's neither a good thing nor a bad thing, because it's what I anticipated, the only thing I was hoping for was that I'd get something else I didn't expect. This kind of heavy romantic drama can utilize a lot of clichés, and I was hoping this one was beloved because it broke the mold a bit. In some ways it did, I was particularly pleased that they didn't fall into the trope of the jealous and controlling parents who don't approve of their daughter's romantic relationship. Instead they were kind and loving parents who merely wanted what was best for their daughter.<br/><br/>There's another somewhat unexpected element to the story, but I'd rather not discuss that in case someone reading this plans on seeing the film someday. I think where The Fault in Our Stars disappointed me, though, was in the plotline of the author. I won't go into too much detail, but a lot of weight is put on a particular book in the film, and there are some interactions with the author of that book which I found to be a frustrating cliché. It feels like a cheap plot construction merely to get the main character to face her fears, instead of a useful part of the story. Aside from that, I can't criticize too much about The Fault in Our Stars, but I also can't say it's all that enjoyable to watch. I suppose if you're in the mood for a therapeutic cry, then this might be the film that could accomplish that for you, but watching teens suffering with cancer and facing their inevitable death isn't my idea of a good time."

"raul_rdv","6","1","1","17 June 2019"," Meh film, unlikeable main character
","Unpopular opinion: Hazel Grace is very unlikeable and kind of a jerk. We'll get to that later.<br/><br/>First, I'm going to discuss the movie in general. Overall it was better than your average sick teen flick. It doesn't solely rely on their condition to make you feel for the characters. It more or less develops them to give you a better understanding of their perspective, their fears, their insecurities. I did feel that the movie tried to be too edgy at times, though. It got to be a bit pretentious (a word I deeply hate and very rarely use). The cigarette metaphor is a perfect example. Pretentious and stupid. Even if you don't light the cigarette, you're still giving money to the corporation. They don't care what you do you with them after you buy them, they already have your money.<br/><br/>Despite being more developed than your average teen romance character, Augustus was a little bland. He was likable, but I wanted more to his character. Hazel had way more depth, which is appropriate considering she's the main character. As I stated previously, I have a lot to say about her character, so I'll come back to her at the end. The parents aren't that fleshed out or explored, which isn't really a fault. The movie is about the kids, not them.<br/><br/>I found it ironic that the film criticizes tropes it later uses. It starts off with a voice over by the main character practically saying (and I'm paraphrasing here), ""This is not one of those movies were beautiful people learn beautiful lessons. This is not sugarcoated. This is dark and bleak and depressing."" It was a bit more depressing and a bit more profound than others films of this style, however we have two attractive protagonist, one of which learns somewhat of a beautiful lesson at the end. If you're going to criticize stories with certain tropes, maybe try not having the same tropes. In general I find it obnoxious when films do that. It's like a self-image of superiority. ""This is no fairytale,"" says the fairytale. ""This is not love story,"" says the love story. Ugh! Don't tell us what the movie is. Let us see it and decide for ourselves.<br/><br/>The music was a generic and corny. The score was forgettable. In fact, I don't even remember if it had a score.<br/><br/>The ending was okay, I guess.<br/><br/>Now... let's talk about Hazel and why I deeply dislike her. I'll start off by saying Shailene Woodley did an awesome job. Her performance elevated the movie to another level. It almost makes you forget how obnoxious her character is.<br/><br/>We being and end with Hazel. At the start she's relatable and interesting. The story does a good job in making you sympathize with her. She doesn't want to go to support group, which is more than understandable. Up to the point where she goes into the support meeting, I was completely on board with her. However, as I soon as she introduces Patrick (the support group counselor) I start realizing she's very condescending towards other people's feeling- people that are also sick with cancer-I might add. Adding flaws to your characters makes them more complex and profound and real. Problem is, the movie doesn't present this attitude of Hazel as a flaw. She introduces Patrick in a manner of extremely contempt. I could perfectly picture her rolling her eyes as she was telling us his very sad story. This is a guy who lost his testicles to cancer, his wife dumped him, he wound up living in his parents basement. Thankfully he found peace and happiness in religion and is now dedicating part of his life to spreading that happiness to sick kids. Hazel's reaction to him is too hostile. She doesn't have to agree with him, nor does she have to be happy. You have your ways of dealing with your disease, your pain, your life. You can look at this counselor and go, ""He doesn't get me or what I'm going through. I am not him. His methods and religious beliefs don't help me."" That's perfectly fine. But the way she introduces us to him, it's like she's saying, ""This person doesn't know what real pain is. Aw, you lost your balls and your wife left you? Boohoo."" I swear that was the attitude she was projecting.<br/><br/>Then we meet Augustus Waters who opens up about his very legitimate fear of dying before being able to leave his mark on the world. His fear is basically to be forgotten. What does Hazel do? He scolds him about his fear and tells him how ridiculous it is. What a b****! If I were Augustus, I'd get pissed. I wonder how Hazel would react if for some miraculous reason she opens up about her fear of having her parents unable to get over her death and someone responds with, ""You're gonna be dead, so what's it to you? You can't control your parents emotions now that your alive, you're certain not going to be able to do so when you're deceased. If that scares you, I suggest you ignore it. God know we all do."" Would she take it lightly? I doubt it.<br/><br/>Towards the end, where Augustus is pretty close to death, he becomes very depressed realizing he won't be able to leave his mark on the world. It's pretty heartbreaking to know you're going to bite the dust without achieving your dream. Does Hazel, his now girlfriend, comfort him? Of course not. Instead she gets all pissed and makes it about her. ""Why can't you just be happy with my love? Am I not enough for you?"" You were severely upset when you weren't able to go to Amsterdam to meet your idol Hazel. You didn't see Gus being all, ""Get over it already. You have a family that loves you. Why can't you just be happy with that?"" Rather he made sure that trip happened for you. The author of an Imperial Affliction is portrayed as a d*** for being a jerk to people despite being in pain. Why is it okay for you to do so? Couldn't stand her. She was all about HER pain and what SHE felt, condescending towards other people's suffering.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie isn't that bad, but the character of Hazel Grace brings it down for me. It's actually kind of ironic because Woodley elevates it at the same time. Making movies and writing deep and complex characters is incredibly hard. This movie isn't that lazy, so I'll give is a pass. I think a six is a fair score."

","It was a decent movie to watch on a Sunday night I guess. The main problems here were that it was WAY too long. They could've accomplished the same movie had they cut 20-30 minutes off. There were also things that kind of got redundant between the two leads that kind of made the movie drag. The two main leads were really good but I didn't feel much for the relationship with the parents or their friends around them. That part of the story seemed like an afterthought.<br/><br/>Had they shaved off some time of the movie, taken out the redundant interactions of the two protagonists, and added in some more of how their conditions were affecting everyone else around them I would've given this a solid 8 - but it's only a 5 from me for now.

"sevenhorseshoes","3","1","1","5 February 2019"," A VERY good idea, but (ironically) not executed in an interesting way.
","It's ironic a movie written by someone who has spent time with cancer patients wouldn't have the movie resonate more completely. But for me, this one didn't. The movie is just kind of there, resting on the laurels that because its main characters have cancer we should automatically forgive for not being be as informative of the subject matter or entertaining as it could've been. I've known people who have died or suffered from horrible aflictions and a lot of little things about this movie felt false. And I felt bad because I like John and everytrhing he contributed to Crash Course series, and wanted to like this.<br/><br/>If you remove the cancer component, it doesn't feel that interesting or real to me. I have a hard time believing that an author would be so horrible to these kids without more explanation and that someone as nice as his assistant would continue to work for him. Although I'm surprised she doesn't forgive him as his apology seemed extremely sincere.<br/><br/>The crash course series in much more entertaining than this was. Movies like this I was hoping would have shown a greater responsibility to the people suffering from cancer and their families how better to cope, that may not know how. This is why I love the movie 6 weeks with Dudley Moore and Mary Tyler Moore.<br/><br/>In this film, the adults felt the most real, entertaining and informative of how people might be dealing with a disease - her mom, dad, the author. Although it was nice to see the author of the book in the movie. For me this was the most interesting part.<br/><br/>Nothing trivializes a movie's few good moments like a half-hazardly chosen songs as accompaniment to prop feelings. This is what the actors were actually for IMO."

Everything that made the book so great has been stripped away, and the result is a movie that in its most ""heart wrenching"" moments is merely funny.

","This could so easily have gone wrong: a story about two teenagers facing life- threatening cancer risks being overly-sentimental but, while being a real tear-jerker, this treads the fine line with skill and warmth. Hazel has thyroid lesions which have metastasised to her lungs and throughout the film wears a breathing tube and lugs around a portable oxygen tank. Gus has n osteosarcoma condition which has stabilised after the amputation of one leg. They meet at a support group for youngsters experiencing cancer and her favourite novel, ""An Imperial Affliction"", takes them to Amsterdam where nothing goes as they expect.<br/><br/>Since the movie is based on a best-selling young adult novel by John Green, it will find a ready audience in spite of its serious subject, but those who don't know the novel (like me) will find this an impressive and moving work because of the fine acting by the two leads - Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, both of whom star in the ""Divergent"" series - and the assured direction by young Josh Boone. Of course, it is easy to be cynical about a film like this, dismissing it as mere manipulation, but ultimately all cinema, indeed all art, is manipulative and this is not a self-pitying, rather a life-affirming, tale.<br/><br/>Footnote: The title of the novel and the film comes from Shakespeare's ""Julius Caeser"" when Cassius declares: ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars but in ourselves, that we are underlings"". For Hazel and Gus, their cancer is in the stars but their response to such tragedy is ultimately in themselves."

"lucasnochez","6","6","15","6 June 2014"," Film Reviews: The Fault In Our Stars/www.nightfilmreviews.com
","I have never been surrounded by so many teenage girls before until I sat down to watch this film. During an early screening of the alluring teenage film adaptation of John Green's novel The Fault In Our Stars, I was surely the minority of the sexes. To be honest, I don't think I knew exactly how outnumbered I was until the film's tragic scenes unfolded, delivering a current of waterworks and overwhelmingly loud wails of screaming, crying and sniffling, predominantly from female audience members. This early screening of the film was jam-packed, and had me sitting only a row away from the massive screen. If Josh Boone's film adaptation of The Fault In Our Stars taught me anything, it's to never underestimate the power of teenage girls and their ability to pack theaters and show their support for films and books they love.<br/><br/>The Fault In Our Stars is guilty of possessing a number of faults, but its biggest sin lies in its persistence to aspire to be greater than it actually is. It succeeds when it exposes us to the tragic relationship between its protagonists and the loved ones around them, and fails when it aspires to find new territory of plot and redemption for characters that are already born with unlimited amounts of pathos.<br/><br/>Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) is as much a teenage girl as any other living in the United States. Her love of reality television, reading and curiosity of the taboo is just as strong as other girls within America. The only difference: Hazel Grace has terminal cancer. The Fault In Our Stars should be a film about cancer and how it effects the people surrounded by it (think 50/50), but it becomes overwhelming with its fascination to overly glamorize the telling of a tainted love story, therefore becoming a love story about people with cancer (think A Walk To Remember).<br/><br/>From the beginning, love, life and happiness are overshadowed by impending doom, and that is perhaps the problem with the film. No matter how much you fall in love with Hazel Grace or Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), their fates are sealed. Green's novel may have been about telling a heart-breaking love story between young teens, but much like Hazel's fascination with her favourite book and the open endedness of a certain literary character, Hazel's happiness is less about coming to terms with death, and more about the continuation of the life of her loved ones. The interactions with the people who will survive and live well beyond Hazel's existence are never given their due diligence on-screen, especially her mother (played delicately by Laura Dern), always being pushed aside by the love story that will ultimately end in unhappiness and tears.<br/><br/>There is sure to be a reason why Green's novel has becomes such a pop culture sensation. The film is said to be a somewhat loyal adaptation, brimming with very clever metaphors of life and death through dialogue and foreshadowing. It does a masterful job of fetishizing the most average looking parks, backyards and parking lots, and makes great use of its supporting actors. Sadly, the two actors that have the most screen time are the two weakest components of the film. Woodley, who is slowly following in the footsteps of Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence, seems to play Hazel Grace less, and herself more. With the exception of her chopping off her hair and having an oxygen tank follow her around everywhere she goes, Woodley only taps the surface of her character Hazel Grace, barely gracing audiences with the brilliance radiating with the promise of such a philosophically pessimistic character.<br/><br/>Elgort, who comes off as a character who is easy to fall in love with, shows much of his charm and promise as a young actor. Elgort as Waters shimmers with potential, delivering a performance of a person who may be a little too cherry and perfect, given sad circumstances.<br/><br/>Green had said to gain the inspiration of the novel by working as a student chaplain at a children's hospital. Drawn to the exuberant life of its terminally ill patients, Green is quoted as saying he wanted to write a book about people who were constantly being dehumanized, while showcasing the abundance of humanity in people with a terminal illness. The film does an excellent job of making audiences believe that love is what keeps Hazel and Augustus alive. Love becomes the answer, but only for so long before the inevitability of death at the end of a terminal illness takes hold. There is a point where love exists, and people fade in the film, and although the relationships that held strong are bonded by love, hope of an improbably oblivion becomes the films main concern.<br/><br/>The Fault In Our Stars can be self-assured as being a quality film made for an audience that would be content with half-assed filmmaking. The production quality and storytelling is top- notch, even if its is constantly emotionally manipulating. The soundtrack is filled with hyper ""emo"" songs, the look and feel of the film is drenched with sadness and all hope is lost with each new, depressing plot twist and turn. Thankfully, its supporting cast of actors supports the majority of the film's life. From Lotte Verbeek, a literary assistant who makes the best out of sad situations and breathes new life to new experiences for the couple, to a saddened and miserable author played wonderfully by Willem Dafoe, to the underused best friend to the couple Isaac (played brilliantly by Nat Wolff), the small, brief appearances by the people in Augustus and Hazel's life are never given enough screen time to show shattering conclusions when sadness strikes."

The man who wrote the book this movie is based upon, have taken key story lines from better films, and then written an under preforming story, that for some reason made it to film. Despite the actors best effort, all characters comes off as cliche's that predestined to just be there because the plot demands them to be. They authors idea of how teenagers behave is ludicrous and frankly just made me laugh. Besides the plot holes and random behaviors, like egging cars for no reason and letting your child travel alone to another continent. You can clearly see where the author have stolen things from better work, and then had nothing to full the rest of the story with. I have never wanted the lead characters in a film to die so badly as this one just so that I wont have to see a sequel."
"Dannov747","3","3","6","28 August 2016"," TIL: Adding cancer as a story theme doesn't make your movie any more interesting or any less shallow
","The Fault in Our Stars is not much more than a cliché romance movie, but with one main difference - the theme of cancer. The fact that both the protagonists have cancer could have given this otherwise atrociously shallow movie some depth, but it didn't. The cancer theme was poorly handled, and despite dealing with such an important and sensitive issue, the movie doesn't rise to anything more than an unoriginal and cliché chick flick. By using it's cancer theme purely as a vehicle for romance, this movie ends up feeling... wrong. It's offensive.<br/><br/>See, this movie is essentially like porn for women. The female lead is a girl most girls can identify with, except that she has cancer. The male lead is, as usual with these type of movies, the boy of every girls dreams, except that he has cancer. He's handsome, clever, fit, alpha male etc. Inexplicably, he has eyes only for the female lead (of course) and is a virgin. <br/><br/>So it's basically just another romance movie. Cancer doesn't give this movie any depth, but it's poor handling of the sensitive theme does make it more offensive. <br/><br/>Oh, and no, kissing where Anne Frank spent several miserable years doesn't make your movie any better, it's just offensive.<br/><br/>Normally I wouldn't review this stuff, but this is the most overrated movie on IMDb."

And the movie keeps the heart of all the lovers of the novel: The Fault in Our Stars.<br/><br/>I wouldn't feel shy at all telling that the movie made me a cry-baby for 126 minutes (Oh no!

Bad acting. I mean... where is the chemistry between these two people? Where does this great 'love' come from that they keep talking about but are not showing? 'Love' story? Not on any level. And how many times can you say OMG in a movie? Was there some kind of Guinness World Record attempt here? It was very distracting and so shallow. I had watched The Good Lie just before this and was bawling my eyes out. This just felt like a cheat after that great movie (great, because it was so real.)"

","Just what I've written in the title... LUCKILY I didn't follow my friends to the cinema for this movie. It would just be a waste of money.<br/><br/>Well, I eventually came over this movie and suddenly got interested in watching this movie, and so I did...<br/><br/>I sat in front of my laptop, expecting to cry my hearts out but halfway through the movie I got BORED!!! I sat there wondering whether I've got a heart made of stone. But hey! I watched several movies that had left me crying my eyes out(At this point i recommend Miracle in Cell No.7). Well, maybe the relationship between Hazel and her mother got me a bit teary eyed but I am proud to say, NOT a tear was shed!<br/><br/>Btw, the plot is just... OLD. Somebody in a relationship is dying, and then he or she starts rejecting the other, for fear that it would bring pain and suffering to the other, however, starts to realize that her time is running out and eventually accept the other and starts to spend as much time with him, cherish their time together... blah blah blah and finally die. I have not read John Green's book but I can't help but think that this kind of plot just keeps getting recycled by movies, producers, writers... I don't even know what to say anymore...(Maybe the book is better? Book readers? I just don't know)<br/><br/>And seriously, what's with the kiss in Anne Frank's house?! And the guys are even clapping?! It's a good thing that the actual house denied the filming of this movie. Or else it would be a GREAT disrespect to Anne Frank.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie and I started to get tired and sleepy. I was constantly checking the remaining time of the movie. That's how boring it is...<br/><br/>So guys, words of advice, wanna find heart breaking, comedy romance, go elsewhere, you can fine none here... And it is damn BORING!!! But hey!

"TheSquiss","5","3","6","24 July 2014"," 2 parts schmaltzy trudge, 1 part beautiful heartbreak. Worth working through. Just.
","The Fault in Our Stars, adapted from John Green's novel of the same name, is the story of Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgort), two teenage cancer patients who meet at a support group, form a friendship and fall in love. It is a fairly typical teen romantic drama of two souls reaching out to one another, each with their own emotional and physical baggage; Gus a prosthetic leg, Hazel the constant companion of an oxygen tank.<br/><br/>For two thirds of the 126 minute running time, Josh Boone's follow up to Stuck in Love is an uncomfortable experience. Not because of the subject matter of cancer and inevitable death, but because The Fault in Our Stars tries so damn hard.<br/><br/>Constantly we are pushed and cajoled into empathizing with the sick teenagers and to feeling the depth of their friendship. It all feels far too forced. Hazel's mother, Frannie (Laura Dern) gushes and sighs sycophantically, everything is amazing, fantastic, absolutely beautiful The dress she gives her daughter is just one example of painful gushing that is promptly undone in the very next scene when a waitress shows them to a table wearing a genuinely stunning dress.<br/><br/>It is irksome, annoying, cringeworthy and the worst kind of labored, insulting, schmaltzy teen pap that ostracizes anyone with at least two years distance from the completion of puberty. I just wanted Hazel to get on and die so I could go home and whinge at my wife for dragging me along.<br/><br/>Then, in the final act, Boone turns The Fault in Our Stars around. In a scene I shall, in the interest of avoiding plot spoilers, refer to simply as the 'poultry' scene, the dynamic changes. From there on The Fault in Our Stars finds a grip on reality, it stops propelling us into emotional traps and just flows, carrying us along with it.<br/><br/>From there on it feels real. The contrivances evaporate, the bludgeoning ends and it just gets on with the job of showing us a heartbreaking story of life that sometimes isn't fair and death that is inevitable, the only mystery being the timing and cause of it.<br/><br/>Elgot is barely watchable without inciting feelings of mild, petulant violence. He is smug, the ultimate jock without an American football team at his back. While I'm guessing Gus should be suave, confident and just ballsy enough to be admirable and lovable, Elgot plays him as cocky and in need of a jolly good slap. Again, regard that as for the first two thirds; in the final act he, too, manages to rein it in a little and pulls us on side. His Gus isn't bad, just annoying and the kind of kid you'd make you wonder why your daughter wasn't aiming higher.<br/><br/>Woodley (The Secret Life of the American Teenager, The Descendants), however, gives a stunning, tempered performance that pulls us onside from the outset. Hazel is a good kid, a sweet girl but not apple pie perfect – close, but Woodley just avoids it. The emotion that pours from Woodley, racks her and shocks us. It is impossible not to imagine ourselves in that situation even if we have limited experience of it. There is no suggestion of onions rubbed into the eyes prior to rolling the camera, just an outpouring of pent up anger and an unfair amount of heartbreak. Stunning! <br/><br/>Though The Fault in Our Stars belongs to Woodley, director Boone and his screenwriters deserve the final compliment. It would have been far too easy, and from the first hour or so I imagined it no other way, to extend the film to its final mulchy conclusions. Boone exercises restraint, turns around a two-star trudge into a journey that ends with possibility within the inevitability. It is a perfect end that leaves a heaviness in the heart rather than the earlier tightening n the stomach.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","Love Conquers All: I saw The Fault in Our Stars starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort tonight at AMC Theatres! ""Hazel"" (Shailene Woodley) meets ""Gus"" (Ansel Elgort) at a cancer support group meeting and they basically fall in love. ""Hazel"" does have doubts about falling in love because of her terminal health condition stating she's a ""Ticking Time-Bomb"" but gives in to ""Gus"" who really goes hard for her. I really liked how they both were very witty even knowing their lives would eventually end. I also liked his style of trying to land a date! Not too aggressive but romantic to say the least. Nothing like two virgins going on a picnic! ;-) <br/><br/>""An Imperial Affliction"" by ""Peter Van Houten"" played by Willem Dafoe was a book mainly ""Hazel"" was obsessed with but her boyfriend ""Gus"" becomes interested in what the book was about, what it had to offer to their relationship, and her real story, not her cancer story. This led ""Hazel"" ""Gus"" and her mother ""Frannie"" played by Laura Dern to take a dream trip to Amsterdam, Netherlands seeking out answers to their questions regarding Van Houten's book.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is quite tragic and emotional, but there's a twist of irony prior to the tragic ending. How would you like to attend your own funeral? Tom Sawyer did in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. I would say, if you go see it, take a box of Kleenex® Brand, your significant, other OR close friend with you, so you have someone's shoulder to cry on! Just sayin... I give it a rating of 9/10!

If I only didn't trust the reviews and not the stars, cause they clearly speak a different language.<br/><br/>So tired of absolutely healthy looking bad actors trying to convince the world that cancer is a beautiful gift that suddenly makes them see the world like it was Disney World, full of beauty and amazing adventures.<br/><br/>Being someone whose family is multiple affected I had to forward a couple of times to even finish this Twilight leveled bull that has absolutely NOTHING to do with the harsh reality of cancer. There is no poetry in it, specially not for affected people in that age.<br/><br/>They don't look like that, don't act like that, don't talk like that, don't think like that and don't die like that. For gawd's sake, stop trying to make it look like despite of the ordeal of cancer there is something that makes it any better.

","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were touched by the story of a couple of young adults, Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgort), both of whom have cancer, and their eventual love affair. One thing they bonded over was a novel about another character with their disease which got them to take a trip to Holland to meet the book's author, Van Houten (Willem Dafoe). I'll stop there and just say there's plenty of touching moments between the couple but also some funny scenes and lines to offset some of the sadness. I also liked Laura Dern as Hazel's mother and Gus' friend Isaac (Nat Wolff). Really, both me and my friend enjoyed this enough so on that note, I highly recommend The Fault in Our Stars."

","I truly do enjoy a good tearjerker as long there is a meaningful realistic story to back it up. Now watching people who are dying of all sorts of Cancer is a very real and emotional, especially if its based on a true story. This flick doesn't seem real at any point and the teen humor that fills in during the hopelessness is just silly. Like allot of death themed flicks, it spends sometime bashing God, Jesus and Christianity but portrays the afterlife as some far out imagination wish. I love flicks that show reality, passion, human suffering in a real life setting but this flick somehow drops the ball. Its a notch above average do to the theme but I would say its Shailene Woodley's least impressive."
"goodread24","10","3","7","14 July 2014"," This movie is worth all the hype it is creating and is already my favorite romantic movie.
","Note: If you think this is another chick-flick, a stupid perverted Rom- com or a depressing story about cancer, ATTENTION: IT ISN'T.<br/><br/>Being a true fan of John Green's 'The Fault', I was looking forward to its movie adaptation with great anticipation. And this movie is just spot on. Josh Boone was successful to bring out the essence of the book on the big screen in the right manner. The actors portraying the characters were utterly perfect and had a great understanding about their roles. I'll start by talking about the rising enigma i.e. Shailene Woodley (known for her lead role in ""Divergent""). She plays the terminally-ill Hazel Grace like no one else could have & makes me see Hazel in a new light. I greatly appreciate the qualities Hazel possesses of empathy, kindness, wit and no-nonsense attitude. I laughed with her, I cried with her & most of all, I understood her. That is what a protagonist is supposed to make you feel like and she did her job well. <br/><br/>""The world is not a wish-granting factory."" Now, my favorite character i.e. Augustus Waters, who is portrayed by the new and talented actor Ansel Elgort (seen in ""Carrie"" and ""Divergent""). I am just biased when it comes to him. First of all, I am irrevocably in love with Augustus Waters; secondly, Ansel is just so cute and charming like a peacock in this role..that I cannot even describe it to the best of my capabilities. He's just adorable. *Sigh* He came in Hazel's life and changed it forever, likewise he changed mine too.<br/><br/>So I was talking about Ansel/Gus. He did his role of a pretentious ,dramatic ,metaphor-believing witty, and funny Augustus with utmost perfection. But when it came to cute, vulnerable, loving, caring , and emotional Augustus, he broke all the dams that were holding my tears back. I literally cried. I won't give any spoilers though. Those who have read the book know what I am talking about and those who haven't should a) READ IT! What are you waiting for? It's a thin book with a roller coaster of emotions. & b) after reading the book, watch the movie! Because this is among the best book adaptations ever.<br/><br/>Then the cute/blind best friend Isaac is played by Natt Wolff. He is a great comic-relief in this movie. I loved how naturally he said all his lines like a normal person does, but I wish he had more scenes just like in the book. He was great though.& so was Hazel's mom, played by Laura Dern .She reminded me of my own mom. Hazel's father, Patrick from support-group & last and the least (pun intended) Peter van Houten were all like a fragmentation of my imagination put into reality.<br/><br/>Thank you John Green for bestowing the world with your acerbic wit in the form of Fault and thank you Josh Boone for making it SO perfect. In a nutshell, this movie is worth every smile, every tear, every laugh. Watch it with your bffs or alone and have the time of your life. Okay? Okay.<br/><br/>This movie is worth all the hype it is creating and is already my favorite romantic movie. I'll rate it with: *****"

","The Fault in Our Stars is amazing. I read the book long before watching the movie and had extremely high expectations.

Shailene and Ansel portrayed Hazel and Augustus perfectly. The storyline was followed. And the quotes were there. Yes. One of the characters from the book wasn't in the movie, Hazels friend Kaitlyn, but even without her (i didn't like her much anyway, just my opinion) the movie was fantastic. John Green wrote an amazing book and the movie version was amazing too. I cried. I laughed. I awhed. But mostly cried. I definitely recommend this movie to everyone. I also recommend the book. Im not much of a reader myself but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The movie brought it to life. You will instantly fall in love with Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus Waters."
"billygoat1071","8","3","7","8 June 2014"," Understanding The Faults
","The Fault in Our Stars is based on a YA novel that somehow becomes a sensation. It's basically one of those which defines the generation's admiration to literature and music, and it majestically expresses them quite sincerely. The movie gives a perfect vision to their blissful moments as a youth. But it's also an uplifting drama about the risks of having cancer and it might be a difficult thing to balance between the sad parts and their happiness, and fortunately it doesn't become a problem. It's not as completely powerful as it should be, but it's wise enough to just embrace its aesthetics and soul.<br/><br/>It's actually not an original thing to see a love story about two sick people trying to gloss over their pain with a relationship. Hazel and Gus's interaction keeps it simple, attempting to forget the real problems of their condition. These types of drama tend to over sentimentalizing the unpleasant truth behind the person in every single moment, but instead, they most of the time just express who they are. The painful moments only happens when it has to remind the two that they are still living with a fatal disease. The film remarkably hits the right note in both elements. The romance is distinctly endearing, the truly soulful moments that aren't meant to be taken away. And the crucial parts which straightly display the reality of what they are going through.<br/><br/>They are definitely affecting, but only at the fine level. The real impact only comes occasionally, and when it goes there, it becomes triumphant. The film just needed a lot more contemplation at the rest of the depression. It's probably too busy focusing at the sweet stuff, but that couldn't be a big flaw anyway. The movie just could have suggested to be tougher. Still, I'm glad it manages to flesh out these characters beyond their struggles. The leading cast shines all around. Shailene Woodley is pretty natural as she imbues the character's personality more than just the angsty feelings. It works in both ways but we get to know Hazel better at the brighter side. Ansel Elgort shares the same feat by showing off his charms, until the performance becomes a nuance when the situation has got a lot serious.<br/><br/>The Fault in Our Stars has favored enough for the fans by being a really good and faithful adaptation of the popular book, but a better movie would deeply contemplated more on the serious stuff. Nevertheless the film still keeps the themes effective; the characters are wonderfully developed and the drama doesn't rely too much on making the audience cry. Overall it's a pretty strong film which standout by its outstanding performances and a direction that fully understands the environment and subtext of every scene, unlike most YA films. And I guess that is what everybody needed for this adaptation."
"hugorocksmy","9","3","7","6 June 2014"," Much More Than Okay!
","This was certainly one of my most anticipated movies of the year, simply because I had read the novel and I really liked it. Therefore my expectations were extremely high, and that is always a problem because for most of the times I end up being disappointed to some degree. And so, I did expect something a little bit different, in terms of emotion but the movie was extremely similar to the novel aside from a few changes. Still, I never got to reach that moment were I felt that this was an adaptation of the book I really loved and enjoyed in many levels. It was something I was hoping for, and it never delivered, except for a few crucial scenes. Moreover, the acting was excellent, Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort were spectacular and were the perfect choice for the characters of Hazel and Augustus. But the movie was Shailene's, she owned every scene and was great once again. While Ansel, he was great too in the way he acted and how he expressed himself and his mannerisms, but I didn't like his physical appearance for the character, to me he wasn't Augustus in the outside but only in the inside. But overall they had a very beautiful chemistry and it showed. Also Laura Dern was excellent too. The movie looked very beautiful, the cinematography gave another sense to the whole movie by not looking like another teen love story about cancer, but a real love story about real people. Furthermore, the ending was something that I knew was coming and that would give me chills, and it was everything I knew it would be. It was extremely emotional and just perfect. Therefore, this was a very good movie, that even though was just like the book, to me it lacked some of the pathos that really made the book very special, but maybe that was just because I knew it was coming. But still, its a very beautiful romantic movie that should please many fans of the book and also those who haven't, that will end up falling in love with Hazel and Augustus. ~June 5, 2014~"
"3xHCCH","7","3","7","5 June 2014"," Young Love in Numbered Days
","I read the book by John Green in one morning. It was a quick read, but it was uncomfortable to read in its sadness. This novel was about the love story between two cancer-stricken teenagers. I am surprised it was a bestseller given the book's topic seemed so morose and upsetting for the young adults that it targets. While it had its effective moments, the book had a language that tended to be rather indulgent and unrealistic given the age of its teen protagonists.<br/><br/>The film is a very faithful adaptation of its source novel. It is so faithful that the faults of the book also become its faults. The film is two hours and ten minutes long. It felt too long, sometimes wallowing too much in its own misery. Luckily, the dialog in the film's script were more believably teenage. I enjoyed the delightful animation used to show us the text messages between the two lovers. The wonderful soundtrack consisted of cool songs by Ed Sheeran and several other indie-type musicians. This type of music highly complemented the film's youthful angst.<br/><br/>Also, the film benefits from the earnest performances from its main cast. Shailene Woodley has a malleable face, not too perfectly pretty or distinct, just right for portraying a wide array of characters. She was really very effective as Hazel Grace, given that this was such a difficult part to play, demanding both physically and emotionally. Ansel Elgort had the charisma required to play her ideal boyfriend, Augustus. The unbelievable perfection of his character as written becomes his limitation as actor. <br/><br/>Ironically, for me the best parts of the book did not materialize that well on screen. These were their Dutch-motif picnic in the park and their heart-to-heart talk about the new PET scan result. The way Ansel Elgort delivered his lines in these two important scenes were not clear enough to create the welling dramatic impact they did in the book. The script did not even include that highly-emotional moment towards the end when there was dead silence after a recording of a beloved voice invited to leave a voice mail.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this film is good to watch depending on your mood. It can give you a good cry if you let it, though I thought the book might be more effective a tearjerker than the film. The best thing about this film is seeing Woodley and Elgort together as Hazel and Gus. The both of them had captured so well the essential chemistry of these two star- crossed lovers as described in the book, and this saves the film from being too depressing."

"DavidYZ","2","2","4","6 May 2017"," Sentimental and miserable wallow in cancer & death
","This romantic drama film is about a teenage couple in the Midwest who are both dying of cancer. <br/><br/>This sentimental film is very disappointing - I don't know why it's so popular. It was misleadingly promoted as a film in which the main characters enjoy fulfilling, happy lives in spite of their bad health. It's actually a feel-bad film about cancer and death. <br/><br/>Why did they cast a plain girl as Hazel? It would have been much more powerful if they'd cast a beautiful girl, who loses her looks as she becomes more seriously ill. I can see that the makers of the film were aiming it at teenage girls by having a plain protagonist get a tall, handsome, older boy who's out of her league. However, by doing so they've made the relationship unrealistic and the film unappealing to the rest of the population. They also made the mistake of having her no more or less ill at the end of the film than she is at the beginning of it.<br/><br/>Eighteen-year-old Gus tells Hazel that he's a virgin. It's highly unlikely that a lad who's tall and of significantly above-average looks would reach 18 without having intercourse, even if he has a false leg. Even if he were that unfortunate, he wouldn't admit it to a girl whom he's sexually attracted to - because she'd laugh at him and never want anything more to do with him. Hazel is surprised, but not bothered. They have sex together once, but we don't find out whether or not she'd previously had sex with anyone else.<br/><br/>The Amsterdam portion of the film is very disappointing. Hazel is inexplicably angrily disappointed about a novel ending abruptly and travels to Amsterdam (four thousand miles away), to meet the author. They go for three days - who makes an eight thousand mile return trip for such a short time?! This reclusive author pays for these two strangers to him to have dinner in an upmarket restaurant and then welcomes them into his house. However, he then angrily rebukes Hazel for criticising the end of the novel in question. In the restaurant, the teen couple pretend to the staff that they're married. This is totally unnecessary in present day Amsterdam - a very sexually liberal city! In any case, very few teens in the Western World are married. They're only in Amsterdam for two or three days, during which they choose to go to the Anne Frank House - but don't even suggest going to the red-light district! Are these the most boring teens in the world?! <br/><br/>At Gus' funeral, Hazel is introduced as his ""special friend"". Who the hell uses that term in modern America when referring to young, heterosexuals who are in a sexual relationship?! The usual term used - even by prudes - is girlfriend.<br/><br/>We never find out anything about the two main characters lives before they had cancer. The film would have been better with some flashbacks to that, to give us more context and background of what their lives were like then."

It was unrealistic (I can't relate to any of the characters), depressing (in that they had cancer) and boring. With a 12 hour flight across the pacific I decide to give the story another chance and watch the film. Exactly the same thoughts.<br/><br/>However, alongside the dull story line you are also faced with the terrible acting, out of touch music and redeeming cinematography. If not for the cinematography this film would be getting a 1/10 rather than a 2.<br/><br/>Overall, an easy way to pass a 12 hour flight.

","I consider myself a woman of taste. If intelligent people tend to like a certain thing, I'm likely to give it a chance. Sadly, I find the praises heaped upon this movie and its source material not only baffling, but frightening. In the first place, I found Augustus obnoxious; not the sort of guy I'd be into at any point in my life. That kept me from buying into the emotions the story is meant to elicit. Shailene Woodley makes for an unpleasant heroine, namely with her chain-smoker voice. John Green has said that the main characters are obnoxious navel-gazers on purpose, but that doesn't redeem them in my eyes. No one ever calls them out on it, and their personalities don't change, so they remain irritating the whole movie long. I'd be willing to spend time with characters like this if they got some sort of comeuppance or maturation. <br/><br/>Furthermore, what about the part where they have their first kiss in the Anne Frank House?! Someone else out there must find it not so romantic. In fact, I've never seen something so flagrantly disrespectful! Is being a middle-class teen with cancer anything like living in danger of the Holocaust? NO! How did John Green not know better? Yes, I am holding him responsible for the movie because, as this page will tell you, he was closely involved in its making. <br/><br/>Green once tweeted ""Why did I have to make TFIOS so sad?"" That is a sign of insincerity. It suggests that TFIOS was written not out of the author's experience but manufactured in the name of True Art. Charlotte Brontë would never ask that about Villette, her best novel. She put the misery and depression she knew too well into Villette so that her story could be heard. John Green is not the sort of person who would have any sad story to tell because he knew what it was like. He can only fail at speaking for others."
"kietsovannprina","8","2","4","20 November 2015"," Amazing film. Worth watching.
","The Fault in Our Stars is one of the best movies I have ever seen; the 126 minutes is worthwhile. It is one of the most captivating, most romantic, not to mention incredibly hilarious, as well. I was initially skeptical about what the book had to offer, but I stand corrected. Immediately after finishing the book, I went on to watch the film, and to be completely honest, I was not completely disappointed.<br/><br/>I was immensely touched by the scenes of this film, how perfectly it has adapted from the book. This movie is by far one of the most realistic films I have watched reflecting upon how life is not what you anticipate it to always be; wishes don't always come true (reference in the film, ""The world is not a wish-granting factory) and each and every single person should live their lives to the fullest (before it is too late). The Fault in Our Stars has broadened my perspective of this world, and of how invaluable life is.<br/><br/>A sorrowful ending indeed, leaving many of us in tears, but just like 'An Imperial Affliction', John Green did leave to us many mysteries in which we will never be able to find out (that is if John Green is similar to that of Van Houten, which I highly doubt) Although, I had my reasons as to why I only gave this an 8/10. One of the main reasons (which you all may find somewhat trivial) is that the characters in the film were not what I had initially imagined them to be like. Isaac should have been uglier, don't you think? What happened to all the things that were described in the film, like having too big pupils? And leaving out parts which I found somewhat significant, such as Augustus' deceased ex-girlfriend. <br/><br/>I also wanted more scenes to the time when Gus passed away. If you're going to make this film sad, why not make everyone cry their eyes out? All in all, it was an amazing film, regardless of the issues I may have had with it."

","This is my first review ever. This film drives me to this. Its one of the best movie i have ever watched. i decided to write this review cause the film has impressed me a lot. I prefer drama, not romance. But I decided to give a chance to TFIOS cause some friends advise me to. I have read the book and enjoyed it. first of all i highlight the acting of Shailene and Ansel. Mostly Shailene. they formed a perfect couple. Is dificult to think they don't have a real affair indeed (i think they have or did). Hazel is depressed in the beginning cause she is ill. When Gus told her she is beautiful she doesn't agree because she is depressed. Gus was able to conquer hazel's heart by means of empathy. He asks her what she likes most and worked to realize such desire. I think this is the best way to conquer a person. The scene of the first kiss in Anne Frank house is a reference to the old film ""The Diary of Anne Frank (1959)"". In that film Anne Frank kissed her boyfriend at the attic right before the Nazis arrived. Hazel is not sure about the afterlife but Gus is certain. But i think Gus started to doubt about it. Because of this he decided to attend his funeral eulogy in case he couldn't attend after death. The end of the film ,i think, is a metaphor for Hazel's death. Observe that she closed her eyes at the very end. The scene at the house of Peter van Houtin was difficult to watch. When i watched the film a second time i skipped this scene at all. I think Hazel decided to change the eulogy at the real funeral because she rather to say something more oriented to Gus's parents. After the first encounter with peter van Houtin she realized that a writer is totally different from his work as a writer and stopped to search for answers. Finally i would say i loved this film and recommend for those who want to watch a good story and fall in love with Hazel."

"pioneerlythere37","8","2","4","18 September 2015"," ""The Fault, Dear Brutus, Lies Not In Our Stars, But In Ourselves...""
","The infamous quote from Julius Caesar basically translates: ""We make our own fates; the stars don't tell us them."" John Green contradicts Shakespeare with his title ""The Fault in Our Stars""; he's saying that children diagnosed with cancer, like Hazel and Augustus in the movie, have their fates written in the stars. The title itself demonstrates how intelligent and deep the movie is. Before watching this movie, I didn't know what to think. I was really expecting it to be just another average romance, and I hadn't even known that it was a tragedy. Hazel's opening monologue made it clear that it was, and my expectations immediately changed.<br/><br/>Somehow I've been able to enjoy both the Divergent series and The Fault In Our Stars, despite my dislike for Shailene Woodley. One reason I didn't like her in Divergent is because she was the wrong actress to portray Beatrice Pryor, and I didn't like the character presented in the movie anyway. I can't say for sure whether or not Shailene Woodley was the right choice for Hazel in this movie, but at least she did her best.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie starts out a little clichéd and uninteresting. Hazel Grace Lancaster goes to a cancer support group, after being forced to by her parents. The support group is at a church, ""literally In the Heart of Jesus"". The first day is just as bad as she expected. The leader is a complete weirdo, and she's not interested in making friends with any of the other cancer victims. The second day, before even entering the room...she bumps into Augustus Waters, and they both are immediately interested in each other, just like in any every other romance movie. She fixes her hair in the restroom mirror before going into the meeting room, and when the group sits down, all Augustus can do is stare at her. She tries to avoid looking back at him, but it's obvious that she's enjoying the attention she rarely gets. Obviously they become friends, he invites her over, and they borrow each other's books. An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a cancer patient, is the book she gives him, and I don't remember the book that he gave her; it's an irrelevant detail. I don't know what she thinks about his book; I don't recall it ever being mentioned, but after he reads An Imperial Affliction, it's all the two of them can talk about. She has sent the author numerous fan letters, but none of them have been answered. Augustus surprises her by reaching Van Houten's personal assistant, and reads her the letter over phone. Of course, as soon as she can she emails the assistant, and the next thing you know they've been invited to meet him in Amsterdam. After a few complications, they finally get to go to Amsterdam, and they eat out and have a great time at a fancy restaurant. Gus tries to pay for the meal, but the waiter declines. ""Your meal has been paid for by Mr. Van Houten."" The next day they visit Van Houten (Willem Dafoe), and the visit is quite disappointing. I'm not sure why, I quite enjoyed the (was it Swedish?) hip hop.<br/><br/>The movie turns out to be surprisingly good and meaningful. The dialogue and writing are a couple of the stronger points of movie, and they help a lot in delivering the message. Some of the movie presented dialogue so deep, so trivial, so meaningful, so powerful you can't help thinking about it for days on end. The Fault in Our Stars is an excellent example of a tragedy at its best.<br/><br/>My Official Score: 83/100"
"UsernameHype","6","2","4","14 September 2015"," I don't really get why people love this movie so much
","It was a typical teen romance drama. It had it's good moments, but there were very few. For the most part the movie just contained sappy and awkward moments. It felt like the movie was trying to make you cry instead of having it happen naturally.<br/><br/>The characters were very weak and mostly stayed with the same motives and barely changed as people. Since their characters never really changed it made the story predictable. Just see how their characters act and feel and you can see all the clichés and how the story will proceed.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't that great either. I have seen both of these actors in other movies where they were much more believable. Shailene Woodley was great in White Bird in a Blizzard and The Spectacular Now. Ansel Elgort wasn't the best actor along Shailene Woodley either, she overshadowed him, which didn't make for good chemistry.<br/><br/>To me the only redeeming part was the soundtrack, which was mostly indie music which fit the mood most of the time.<br/><br/>The Fault in Our Stars is a generic teen romance movie. Nothing new comes out of this movie. The little redeeming qualities made me give it a better score than it deserves."

I was sobbing away along with everyone else in the cinema.. It really isn't a film I would normally go see but i'm glad i did because it was very touching. What a beautiful film, even from a male's point of view. It really was one of my favourite films ofthe year, one of my all time favourites actually.

","This film is a love story about two teenagers with cancer, however the film may be about cancer there is so much more than just cancer. It's about two teenagers who who meet each other though a support group and except that they have to deal with their illnesses. This film is filled with all sorts of emotions from happiness, and laughter to anger and sadness. It has amazing actors and actresses in the film and you feel like you actually connect with the characters and feel their emotions. It is an amazingly powerful story that's full of surprises. It's not your every day love story, it's a story that will stay with you forever and leave your mind wondering after the film has finished. However I would really recommend reading the film first, firstly it may help you to understand the film and secondly the book contains more of the story and more characters. Overall it is an amazing film and book that is definitely worth a watch."
"preetjee313","9","2","4","24 August 2015"," Enchanting and a must watch
","Well, lets begin with a line from the movie (believe me, this one's full of 'em) ""If you want the rainbow,you have got to deal with the rain."" The movie is a very soothing journey as you travel beside Hazel Grace the protagonist of the movie and you get to see lives of few teenagers struck by cancer. The plot is sad on the whole but this very fact delivers the enchanting touch to the viewers. It is very well directed and story is really touching; I haven't read the book but having seen the movie I'm sure the book shall be awesome too. In terms of story content the movie doesn't offer much as I can possibly sum it up in a few sentences (don't worry I won't do that) but this is certainly the type of movie one doesn't watch for the story, you watch it for its sheer beauty and emotions. Woodley and Elgort appear as a great adorable couple, interestingly both of them are quite different but still incomplete and they fell in love because they in a sense complete each other and also teach each other and the audience great lessons about life. They show us that in spite of all difficulties and pain we endure there are always people who love us unconditionally and will always remember us no matter what happens and it is our duty to pause and enjoys those really great moments with them rather than yearning for public recognition. This is aptly reflected when Augustus mention that,""Hazel was not widely loved but she was deeply loved"" and I guess that is what is important for all of us to understand. You see her favorite writer flooded with letters symbolizing fame and wide respect, love but is in constant misery and not at all in peace but his work has motivates many like Hazel. So, what is the point of all this fame when is doesn't bring peace to you.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with exquisite sequences portraying Hazel and Augustus as a very adorable couple, their date in Amsterdam is particularly well shown where the actors aptly exhibit the excitement as well as anxiety of a first date.Well, I'll end this citing another dialogue, this time from Augustus, ""There's a thing about pain, it demands to be felt."""

","Hazel (Woodley) has cancer and can die at any moment when her lungs fill with water. August (Elgort) has cancer, is in remission, but.. Both meet at a Cancer Support Group and August falls instantly in love with Hazel. We do too. (you're too easy)<br/><br/>I cannot say enough good things about this movie. It is perfect, witty, honest and will be hard to forget. It's almost like a true story, but it's not. However we will (read should) be reminded of it when we encounter someone with cancer. They struggle with things we take for granted. Things like breathing. See? Keep in mind that although we see stories for our entertainment, real dangerous things have happened to people with medical issues and we should always be aware of that. <br/><br/>The movie pulls us in instantly as August goes flirting with Hazel and the banter between them is pure gold and it also pure gold the rest of the way. We hope August is a good guy, sincere, and level headed because we like Hazel and don't want to see her hurt. When Hazel is sad, we are sad and when she cries.. August never disappoints. <br/><br/>Shailene Woodley deserves an Oscar for Best Actress and Ansel Elgort for Best Supporting Actor. Whoever cast them for this movie is a genius. They were great together with a chemistry not often found in movies. Their love will touch us for the entire movie and maybe beyond. <br/><br/>August finds a way to get Hazel to Amsterdam to meet her favorite author Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) as she needs to know the answers to some things in his novel. Dafoe does good in this curmudgeon role.<br/><br/>Go to the cupboard or store and get a box of Kleenex because you will need it at times. Although much of the dialogues and banter is light and witty, there will be times they are not so. This is a most impressive, heartfelt, touching and well told story. <br/><br/>You asked about a twist even though this story is rather straight forward and a twist isn't really necessary. However, there is one and you'll be reaching for that box when you see it. <br/><br/>Notables: Laura Dern as Hazel's mother and Sam Trammell as Michael, Hazel's father. Both are truly supportive of Hazel and also of August.<br/><br/>We all are subjected to the fault in our Stars (read dreams) and this fault can never be corrected. That is the saddest part of life. (10/10)<br/><br/>Violence: No. Sex: Yes, kind of implied. . Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb in Amsterdam. Brief small stuff at times."

","Based on John Green's immensely popular novel by the same name, adapted for the screen with extreme skill by Scott Neustader and Michael H. Weber, and directed with sensitivity and taste by Josh Boone THE FAULT IN OUR STARS steps so far beyond expectations that it may just be another Nicholas Sparks young adults tearjerkers and actually becomes one of the more impressive dialogues about death and dying and the meaning and importance of love. Add to that a cast of young actors (an experienced actors) who 'live' their roles and the result is a film that should be experienced by everyone.<br/><br/>Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus (Ansel Elgort) are two teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps them on a journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous, given that Hazel's other constant companion is an oxygen tank, Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they meet and fall in love at a cancer support group. Add to that the presence of Gus' best friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) who also has cancer which makes him lose his eyes (and his mental stability at times) and we have a trio of youth facing enormous odds who end up discovering the real meaning of being alive in the world and the importance of love. Hazel's parents are (for once in film) sincerely supportive in the face of a dying child and realistically portrayed by the brilliant Laura Dern and Sam Trammel. Hazel and Gus travel to Amsterdam to visit Hazel's favorite novelist Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) and discover he is a smarmy drunk who lives with the compassionate Lidewij (Lotte Verbeek). Sharing how the story plays out would involve spoilers for those who have not read the book.<br/><br/>The on screen chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgot sends this film into that rarefied realm of becoming a classic. But for this viewer, even more important is the lesson it offers about the process and concept and meaning and insignificance of death as an ending: it is a continuation."

","Last summer, when my friend bought the book for his sister, I judged it by its cover. I thought it was yet an other ""Notebook"" but I was wrong.

Even so, I felt like I should go on with it, and so I did to see how it'll turn out. I can only say I'm ashamed of my passed judgment based on arrogance and ignorance.""The Fault in Our Stars"" is one of the things in life that's intensely beautiful enough to move me. What I admire most about this story is it being so realistic. You don't see cheesy idealistic events or plans going on through the plot. For instance, when Hazel's on the stairs, she doesn't play the typical damsel in distress, she gathers herself and believes she can do it. (Spoiler) Van Houten is considered to be Hazel's fascination subject due to his work. She loves his work and automatically loves the author as well. (Huge Spoiler) When she meets him in person, she learns he's not as idealistic as she thought he was (or equally idealistic as his work).

It's so sad how cancer just kills you silently and loses a loved one that you have been with for so long. I was gutted that Gus passed away and I was thinking at the end of the film that Hazel could've died too when she was looking at the stars lying on a field. <br/><br/>This movie is really good but if you have a softie personality, then I suggest you get ten tissue boxes lol!"

","After reading the novel for a summer class (the same reason I watched the movie) I was fairly surprised at the movie's fast pace, its good cinematography, and that each character was written to be as accurate to their representation in the novel as possible (besides Hazel's Dad, I was promised a crying Dad, not a perfectly secure Dad). However, I am not going to compare the movie to the novel now as I will mostly be doing that for the class since the class focuses on adaptation.<br/><br/>The casting for Hazel (Grace) Lancaster is near perfect in my opinion even though I had not heard of the actress before viewing the film. Shailene Woodley taps into the lead character's mind with great skill, able to depict Hazel's personality filled with sass and sarcasm as well as being able to cry on many occasions within the film without exaggerating how sad the character is supposed to be, which is usually how actors handle crying: it either doesn't happen at all, or it happens with ridiculous intensity. Woodley is able to be more subtle, handling the character near perfection. All other actors give mediocre performances, including Laura Dern (who I have never loved as an actress anyway). I wanted to like Willem Dafoe's character, but his performance seemed as though it was heavily directed and did not require any creativity from Dafoe himself.<br/><br/>To lift the mood and ignore we are focusing on dying teenagers in this movie, it is surprisingly funny at certain points, such as when Augustus nonchalantly gives his near-blind friend Isaac permission to break his basketball trophies while maintaining a serious conversation with Hazel - his love interest, which no moment of the film lets us forget.<br/><br/>For me, moments of this film are extremely cheesy or do not explain things well. Some terms relating to cancer which average viewers would not understand are used once or twice in the film with little explanation, and the dialogue is trying way too hard to be teenager dialogue. ""Listen douchepants,"" sassy comebacks, and corny statements like ""Okay will be our always"" (you probably won't understand this one out of context) are abundant in this film, exaggerating how ridiculous teenagers are or even giving them too much intelligence at times - especially Gus.<br/><br/>This movie was surprisingly entertaining to me, and I have to admit it is a ""chick flick"" which I would actually watch again without cringing in disappointment. You may not be able to handle yourself as well as I did for this story, so maybe have some tissue in the room if you're going to watch this one."

","After watching this movie, I won't say that I'm surprised to see so many negative reviews. People who look to this film for cliché moments and things to gripe about will find them, but only because they're not capable of getting beyond what they perceive as unrealistic story-telling to see the true essence of what this film is trying to express; a story of suffering and of trying to find purpose in life, even when that purpose has to change and adapt to the suffering.<br/><br/>In no way do I see this film as pretentious or nauseating. I think it tells a very honest story, even if it does so in a dramatic way. It's not a perfect film and the acting isn't always profound, but the story itself stays so true to its characters that I think the end result is a film which tells a very powerful story in an almost- perfect way. <br/><br/>Personally, I very much enjoyed it. I wouldn't give it a 10, but it's a solid 9. At no point during this movie did I wish it was over, and by the end of it I felt like I was able to gain something very positive...Which, by the way, should be the objective of any film. If realism is all you care about then watch the news. In my opinion, all of the negative reviews on this film are absolutely baseless. It may not be for everyone, but it is for anyone who has emotional depth or an appreciation for human experiences outside of their own...However idealistic they may seem. <br/><br/>And just to add some perspective -- I'm a 27 year old male with no close experience with cancer, or really anything expressed in this film, and I still was able to find something in it that I could appreciate on my own level. It's not a movie that's just for one kind of person, and I don't think it was created to be that way. I think this is a film for all people...And it's well worth the two hours it took to watch it. It will certainly leave you feeling some kind of way."

Those hopes were quickly dashed. <br/><br/>This film is one long cliché. Every scene you feel like you've seen 100 times before. And except for Woodley (who they must have paid boat loads of money) the cast was not good. Woodley's parents were so miscast, I felt like they must have walked out into the hallway and grabbed the first male and female actor to walk by. Contrast this to the relationship between Miles Teller (son) and Jennifer Jason Leigh (mom) in Spectacular Now which was an amazing look at a mother-son relationship. Woodley's parents were more like placeholders to deliver the proper cliché at the proper moment. <br/><br/>And the fact that Woodley's character seemed to be near death in every other scene just telegraphed the fact that it was the boy who would be the one to die. I knew nothing of this story, but that was so obvious to me almost from the first scene. And OMG, the slow clap after their first kiss!

","Hollywood capitalizes on a young adult bestseller and doles out the usual drivel in the hopes of a blockbuster.<br/><br/>Not to say that The Fault in Our Stars is drivel, per se, but it lacks the magic and emotion that is captured in John Green's acclaimed young adult novel. I read the book awhile back, and while I had minor issues with the plot, it resonated with me because of this tragic but tender love story.<br/><br/>Time to tears: Book – last 90 pages (Don't judge me!) Movie –fleetingly at 1hour 53 minutes (I'm not a monster!) <br/><br/>The movie followed the book to the letter, but is vastly ineffectual. <br/><br/>The screenplay is lazy and a bad adaptation; writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber did not take the time to translate Green's writing for the screen.<br/><br/>The directing by Josh Boone was unimaginative and literal; reverting to lame voiceovers and text bubbles instead of good structure from the screenplay for workable content and acting.<br/><br/>Both writers and director seem inexperienced beginners earning their stripes with this film.<br/><br/>The acting was not great and the main characters were miscast. I can see why Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort were cast as Hazel and Gus respectively; they were able to pull of the emotional scenes near the end. Lacking was the charm for the entirety of the rest of the film. Woodley is basically a happily bewildered toothy smile while Elgort is overconfident and decidedly not charismatic.<br/><br/>I did think Willem Dafoe's casting was spot on and found Nat Wolff to be underutilized as Gus's best friend.<br/><br/>This film was a higher budgeted version of some hybrid Disney-Hallmark made for TV-movie trying to be more. Frankly, I am a bit offended at how juvenile the final product seems as the film version was not smart and belittling to readers of The Fault in Our Stars. Yes, it is an adaptation of young adult book about teens finding love while being deemed 'cancer patients' but it didn't need to be this horrible cheese-fest!<br/><br/>More film reviews at our website."

","*HERE BE SPOILERS* During the long, drawn-out ending of this movie, I could hear sniffling and noses being blown everywhere. And indeed, if you're looking for a weepy to blub your heart out to, then this could be the film for you. Now, I have to confess on my side... the vision did get slightly blurred... but certainly not the flood-like levels I experienced around me. I last time I saw this level of collective sobbing was Titanic... I guess there's something about a charming pretty boy dying young that sets off the ol' female tear ducts. ""HE HAD ALL HIS LIFE AHEAD OF HIM"". *Snort*... ""Madame, could you please remove your hankie from my lap?!""<br/><br/>Anyway, credit where credit is due... this is, for the most part, an engaging portrayal of two intelligent teenage cancer sufferers who don't know what the future holds. Gus appears to be in remission but has had a leg amputated, while Hazel has only one lung after her treatment, and has to lug an oxygen tank with her everywhere. They meet at a support group, which is of course full of false platitudes and unhelpful advice. The couple connect almost instantly in this staid atmosphere, and before long they're swapping books and sharing their own unique brand of black comedy.<br/><br/>In fact, they make a perfect match... which makes it all the more tragic that inevitably, one (or both) will pass away soon. Come on... you've seen the way this movie is marketed... you weren't expecting a happy ending. But before she shuffles off this mortal coil, Hazel wants to meet the author of her favourite novel in the flesh... because the story he wrote had an unsatisfactory conclusion that she wants elaborating on. One problem: he now lives in isolation in Amsterdam, and she doesn't have the money to get there. Plus, her health may be at risk during the flight. Thanks to Gus and her family's efforts though, her dreams come true...<br/><br/>The trip to Holland is eye-opening in more ways than one, as our intrepid duo have an unforgettable three days. Sadly, it's all downhill from there as events take a turn for the worst.The film does begin to lose some of it's power by becoming a bit too melodramatic, and the previously witty dialogue turns rather flowery to this trained ear. Still, it studiously avoids maudlin sentiment for the most part... So I suppose we can allow it to get a little morose during the climax. As long as old biddies seated nearby could be more careful with their snotrags in the future. Jeez... 6/10"
"angell-an-wright","5","2","4","15 June 2014"," A good but very sad film
","I watched this film without actually reading the book. I saw it on the adverts and i just had to watch it. I was a bit put off at first as it was about a woman with cancer... <br/><br/>I am not a fan of films like that as they usually feature death. I am not a huge fan of death. <br/><br/>I finally decided to watch it as everyone else had seen it and from the beginning i enjoyed it. The storyline was clever, it had it's funny moments and it had it's sad moments. <br/><br/>Throughout the storyline i found myself becoming quite attached to hazel (the main character)and found myself unable to stop crying at bits. Then the storyline had all this plot twists that even i (a person who can predict what is gonna happen before it actually happens in a lot of films)could not guess. <br/><br/>The ending was very very very sad and i could not stop crying at it. I have to admit it was one of the best films about a person with cancer that i have ever seen. It made me want to go out and get the book, <br/><br/>i enjoyed watching it and i highly recommend it to anyone, as long as you do NOT forget to bring your tissues... Not a waste of money to see at the cinema :)"
"cptamerica2","6","2","4","9 June 2014"," Overall Good, not great
","First of all, I have not read the book. However, my girlfriend's teenage daughter has and I went with them to see it. I'll start by saying the acting was really good. The only other thing I've seen Woodley in is the Descendants and I remember thinking what a great job this young person is doing. Well she does it again in this film. The thing about this movie that I don't like is how it emotionally manipulates the audience. Now granted all forms of media do that, that's the point of film, books, music etc. But this film lays it on really thick that to me was unbelievable. I think it could have been a little more subtle. For subject matter that is very real and very believable the way everything played out to ensure maximum tears from it's audience was not. Most specifically the Gus' uncanny ability to perfectly execute all these hopeless romantic endeavors to make the audience fall in love with him. Even after the climax. It just wasn't real enough to me for subject matter that is supposed to be very real. I did like the movie overall. But that's why I give this a 6."
"haydenluz","8","0","0","7 July 2020"," The Fault in Our Stars
","The Fault in our Stars, originally written by John Green, was directed by Josh Boone, who has no credentials, and is basically a no name. With that being said, he made a very appealing film, that thankfully missed the cliché moments. This story is very meaningful, backed up with a witty and powerful script, that tugs on the heart strings more than a few times. The story partially narrated by Shailene Woodley added this deep feeling, that helped engage the audience.<br/><br/>The lead characters in Shailene Woodley & Ansel Elgort (a fellow New York Knick fan) had this great, emotional chemistry, that sold me from the first scene they met. Their character development individually, and together was one of the best I've seen in a romantic movie. Both of their acting was oscar nomination worthy. All of the supportive characters were nothing but plot devices, but everyone was pretty good; We didn't just get some annoying friends or side characters, like usual.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie may have not been as good as the book, but Boone did a damn good job putting it on the big screen."

","The Fault In Our Stars (2014) :
Movie Review -<br/><br/>The fault is not in the Love story and Emotions but the Fault is in the additional Metaphorical theory. I remember skipping this film when released because i had read the synopsis of Novel and i thought it won't look exciting due to predictable plot. Now i thought let's give it a watch because the bollywood remake is about to release and it would help me to decide which adaption was better. In bollywood we have seen such love stories already, may be not exactly as it is but very similar and proudly more emotional so i would be eager to see how Dil Bechara is shaped. When i went through the basic story of the novel 6 years ago i didn't really find anything allegorical but yes it sounded very emotional and heart touching. I have seen many of that stuff too so again its like losing little more interest. Anyways now i have seen it and i would like to point out some mistakes instead of admirable things because mostly emotions end up making less sense. But no need to take this review so negatively, i am saying it before i begin bashing that i would still recommend this film to everyone so you please watch it regardless of what mistakes i point out. The Fault In Our Stars does full justice to the love story and emotional story from the original novel but couldn't overdo the metaphorical proportions when there was a golden chance. I don't need to explain about the love story and emotions of this film because they definitely work and are difficult to hate. The problem is in the detailing of the plot and metaphorical portion which has been sidelined for the sake of emotions. See, there is a girl with thyroid cancer who falls in love with a cancer affected boy who has a great sense of humour. He brings the happiness in her boring life and all that portion is presented beautifully in the film. I started loving the film in first 10 minutes only which doesn't happen regularly. The dialogues and scenes in the first 50 minutes were wonderful and shockingly intellegent. Then the film lost the grip when most of its humourous quota was finished, this is where the film came one step down from it's high level. Next, the metaphorical and subtle thoughts were sidelined because we are not so smart audience and we love to see typical emotional and love theories instead of intellectual stuff. Then onwards i begun to search for mistakes in every scene and the level was one down again. I just wish what if the level was kept solid high throughout? The film would have ended as an Unforgettable Classic. I just couldn't understand how all of sudden the guy with great sense of humour started behaving like a common man? Was it because he fell in Love despite knowing that his life gonna end soon? Didn't he have that much brain to understand it? Does falling in love means you should lose your intelligence? On the other side, that so called girl who is Smarter than others has nothing to freak out than just meeting an author of book? How can she be so desperate for such a small and ignorable thing? When did she behave smartly to be called smarter? Wait a sec, her parents had money for the expensive treatment since childhood but has no money for one freaking trip to Amsterdam? Poverty? Seriously? The author has been given so much importance nonvigilantly, what's his role in the film actually? How did he help in the impact of the story? It was just another Normal character. Now one of the biggest problem is the climax scene. Well, the climax is not a problem, the problem is not elaborating the connection of it to the earlier scene when the girl tried to avoid the boy for his own betterment but at last she realises that he already knew it. That's metaphor but many people didn't get it because it wasn't presented smartly. Technical errors of the film cannot be ignored, such big errors they are. Cinematography and editing is so bad occasionally. Finally coming to the positives, the acting of both the leading actors is fantastic. Laura Dern in the side role was adorable. Dialogues in the first half are amazing, clapworthy and highly sensible but as bad in the drag moments of second half. Direction is very good considering the aim of paying more attention to the emotions and love saga but like i said, i want to repeat again, the Subtle and Metaphorical proportions of the film deserved to be explored in terms of Greatness. Overall, a Very Good and Adorable film but unlikely to work as a tear-jerker and unlikely to be called a work of a Genius.<br/><br/>RATING - 7/10*"

The two main character had get chemistry together. The romance was great. The story had lots of emotions like happiness, sadness and so much more. The ending was so unexpected when I first saw it I didn't think it was gonna ended up the way it did. I knew something sad was gonna happen but I didn't expect it to happen to who it happened too.

I should have known it before that a movie cannot really depict everything out of a book. A female friend of Hazel is missed out, important signs of pain felt by Augustus is missed out, the author of Immperial affection is not the person which was described in book, hazel had to search for Augustus letter everywhere and finally she gets it via Author's assistant which was hand written as per the novel. Similarly many points are missed by, off course the movie has done really good job for depicting such long story in a 2 hour film with really nice background musics. I would still suggest this anyway."

","I haven't seen this since theaters just because it was so emotional I wanted to spare myself. This review is for the extended version which is actually just a touch better because like the book it's not afraid to show a little bit more truth of the situation. This teen weeper is about a young woman named Hazel played by an always strong Shailene Woodley (The Descendants) whose had cancer since she was young. She tries to deal with stuff as realistically as possible even when she meets hunky, swoon worthy Gus played by charming Ansel Elgort (Baby Driver) in a star making performance. They have great chemistry and he pushes her boundaries giving her somewhat of a new lease on life. Initially I was more moved by the parents story and their amazing performances by Laura Dern (Jurassic Park) and Sam Trammel ( True Blood). I still felt like that was very strong but with the extra footage I was really enamored with the central relationship. Although I'm 40 I really felt their story and was even more affected by it's tragic outcome. Funny, sad and powerful Fault is one of the best weepers of all time.<br/><br/>Budget: $12m

","The two protagonists in the movie have overcome their own fears after getting along with each other, falling in love, and experiencing death. Augustus already understood that one should seek a deep-loving admirer, not the admiration of the whole world. Hazel, perhaps when he suffered Augustus 'love and death, also understood his parents' feelings about himself. We all came to this world in order to bear love. Our death also bring pain to those around us. But pain should be felt and can be tolerated too. This is life. Perhaps, when we discuss cancer, the most we think about is probably life itself. There is luck and happiness in life, as well as pain and misfortune."

","Giving 10 stars to The Fault In Our Stars would be an understatement. I'd give a constellation if i could. This movie turned out to be an outlet to my emotions. I've been emotionally unstable from the past few days worrying about what my future holds and thinking about all the mess i've been through. In all this fuss i havent exactly valued the life i have and this movie showed me how grateful i am to be with and spend time with the ones i love and to have them right by me; that i have tons of memories yet to create with them. It doesn't really matter how much time you spend with someone but how you spend the time you have. Hazel and Augustus gave each other a ""FOREVER"" in a number of days. Only a person who has seen death can deeply understand how important it is to live your life fully and to live each moment to the fullest. The most important thing which links a viewer to a movie is how an actor connects himself with the character and how he potrays the emotions on screen. I could actually feel the pain when hazel lost augustus. He wanted to be remembered by everyone but to be remembered by the special one is enough. To me the quote ""some infinities are larger than other infinities"" imply that some moments no matter how small they are but if they hold the essence of true happiness are greater than other moments. God has given us one life and though we can not change our fate but we do get to change the path which will lead us to our destiny. NJ"

"abhijith-alpha","6","0","0","27 August 2019"," The Fault in our stars undoubtedly does what every entry from that genre promises to do; make us cry like babies, mucus dribbling down our snoot and all.
","The Fault in Our Stars, based on the bestselling Young Adult book of the same name, belongs to a very particular subgenre, which combines teenage romantic drama and debilitating disease. I have seen only a few movies belonging to this genre. Love Story (1970) is apparently the movie that is the gold standard in this genre. I have seen its modern successor, A Walk to Remember (2002). Suffice to say, I wasn't in control of my emotions for the next three days, and it might have cost me ten-fifteen marks in my XIIth Board English language exam. So, in spite of knowing nothing much about the movie outside of the trailer, I armed myself with a healthy dose of cynicism and went to the theatre.<br/><br/>And I cried.<br/><br/>2014 was the breakout year of Shailene Woodley. She had just wrapped up her TV show and her last four movies were the Oscar winning The Descendants (2011); the indie hit the Spectacular Now (2013); the experimental thriller White Bird in a Blizzard and dystopian thriller Divergent (both released in 2014). The last one, also based on a bestselling YA franchise, had made her a global star, and she had by then firmly established herself among the talented crop of young actresses in Hollywood. She continues her fine acting form here, portraying the cancer patient Hazel Grace Lancaster with great sensitivity and wit. She conveys energy of a doomed teenager exceptionally well, compassion oozing from her body, and quiet strength in the way she defies the role of a cancer patient. Eschewing self-pity, Hazel tries to manage her emotions while acutely aware of her parents' struggles, which she knows in her heart she will leave soon. Trying to make sense of her emotions, the well-intentioned parents send her to group therapy, where she meets fellow cancer patient Augustus Waters. ""Gus"", played by the talented Ansel Elgort in only his third movie, is a plucky former athlete who, after a losing a leg to cancer, is determined to lead a happy life. They inevitably fall in love, and there are a few surprise touches in their story, yet after the crying stopped I didn't find anything solid underneath the movie. Maybe I am too cynical. Or maybe because I don't have a debilitating disease and don't have first hand information on how people behave with such knowledge playing in their minds. I had a problem with how Gus fixates on Hazel at their first meeting and decides to pursue her, in spite of her doing nothing of any interest in the meeting. The fact that Hazel returns the affection without any conflict doesn't exactly cover up for this glaring hole in the plan, but maybe something got lost in the almost-literal translation of the book to the screen. There is a kiss scene between Gus and Hazel in Anne Frank museum, which I thought was wholly inappropriate, given the setting. Gus comes off as a cocky smart mouth, as opposed to charming rogue, which did make me wonder why they didn't go with Miles Teller, who had great chemistry with Woodley in The Spectacular Now. Maybe because Elgort has the wholesome corn-fed American boy look done pat.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the parents aren't portrayed as clueless impediments in the lives of their children, set up as a target of scorn and ridicule by the audience. The lovely Laura Dern plays Hazel's mother with great empathy, and along with Sam Trammel, who plays the father, makes the best of the thinly sketched characters. Nat Wolff makes the best use of his time as Isaac, Gus' best friend. Willem Dafoe interrupts the feel-good, non-conflict vibe of the movie as a reclusive and cranky author, and the beautiful Lotte Verbeek from The Borgias (2011-13) has a cameo as his assistant.<br/><br/>If you are a connoisseur of Hollywood cinema, you know how the broad strokes of the story will go, and you will cry, laugh and cry again at the appropriate times, and hopefully that should be fine. Because that is the most I got out of this movie. Good performances all around, but a one-time watch is all I recommend. Maybe two, if you're hanging out with your Significant Other and wouldn't mind crying a bit.<br/><br/>VERDICT: 6/10<br/><br/>Go for Shailene Woodley."

"Hotdesio","7","0","0","2 June 2019"," An OK teen RomCom/Sad Drama for a Sunday afternoon, tissues optional.
","When I read the reviews of this film I had the filter set to Helpfulness and I couldn't work out if this was the best film ever or the biggest steaming pile of excrement you will ever see. The first eight reviews were 9-8-10-9-8-10-9-10 and I was getting very excited but then suddenly, there were eight 1's in the next 12 reviews....hey? I saw reviews like this with The ""Before..."" trilogy (Sunrise, Sunset, Midnight), I loved those films but others just didn't get it and the 10's and 1's reflected that but I don't think this film falls into that category. At the time of writing this film is 7.7 which is sort of about right. We all have different scales and for me, anything over 7.8 falls into the pretty good category and over 8 into the very good...and so on. When leaving a review there really isn't anything that should get a 10 or a 1 as where can you go when something comes along that is better or worse? As it happens, this is mentioned in the film and it's not a spoiler to say that she describes her pain as a 9 because, well, it could be worse.<br/><br/>So having got all of that out of the way, this film is a 7.7 which for me falls into the ""OK"" category. Shailene Woodley is the stand out actress with the rest just, meh, although Willem Dafoe's almost cameo appearance does add a bit of bite to it. My wife loves a good RomCom and is always reaching for the tissues and although she did again with this film, not as much as she usually does. I've shed a tear watching Cars, fought them back in the final scene of Pay It Forward and bawled my eyes out at.....well, you get the picture but not this time. I just wasn't moved enough by the performances or the script. This film is a little similar to Five Feet Apart which we watched yesterday and for me, I preferred that. Its rating is 7.1 which I feel is a little low and should really be a 7.7 with this film being 7.1. Anyway, It's OK without breaking any new ground and even the twists you could see coming and I found myself predicting the script a few times it was that generic. 7.1 for me."

"elliott_nash","7","0","0","18 May 2019"," The fault is in the script, but still beautiful nonetheless.
","First off, i hate to be that guy, I really do. The Fault in our stars, or TFIOS for short, really did play up the tumblr, edgy teen culture. For those who are familiar, will definitely understand. For those who can not fathom the utter confusion that is click clacking from my keyboard, let me explain.<br/><br/>TFIOS really did have some questionable script writing and just weird, trying too hard metaphors. Augustus, the young boyfriend to fellow cancer patient and main character; Hazel, followed the cheap bad boy gone good image, topping it all off posing with a cigarette. Because, you know, it's definitely NOT to appeal to the edgy ""look at me, Im young and I smoke, i'm so deep"" scene.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, the movie is good. very good. It's sad. Very sad. There's something oddly heartwarming about a young couple who fight through pain together. The pain in this story however is the fact the couple share cancer. Although, it indeed hide the gore and scars of the devastating disease, it needs to be remembered it is a love story, NOT primarily about having cancer.<br/><br/>To keep in relatively short, Shailene Woodley (Hazel) great performance,, Ansel Elgort (Augustus) stole the show at the petrol station (you'll see) , Nat Wolf (Isaac) (Gus' friend) one touching scene, Parents (mum: Laura Dern, had great moments) (Dad: Sam Trammell, about as moving as a sleeping snorlax without the poke flute).<br/><br/>I suggest watching this with plenty of tissues as this will make you cry. Too many times to count. The soundtrack complemented the movie very well and, in the end, shows that an egg on it's own may be repulsive, if you cook that with other ingredients, you get a lovely sweet cake, like this movie.<br/><br/>The movie is sweet."

It's a drama and romantic film directed by Josh Boone, written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. It was released on 2014. It is 2h06 min long, it may seen long but it's worth it. From the first minutes of the film we're caught in the story and it goes very quickly!<br/><br/>The story is unbelievably beautiful. The music is incredibly well chosen! It conveys emotion. It makes us hang on the story and puts us in the character's place. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort are perfect in the role of Hazel and Augustus. They convey their emotions.<br/><br/>I've already read the book but I prefer the film.

","The Fault in Our Stars is a 2014 American romantic tragedy film, directed by Josh Boone, based on the 2012 novel of the same name by John Green. The film stars Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort. Woodley plays Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen-year-old cancer patient who is forced by her parents to attend a support group, where she meets and subsequently falls in love with Augustus Waters, another cancer patient, played by Elgort.Since childhood, Hazel has respiratory problems, forcing him to wear an oxygen tube continuously. On her mother's advice, she joined a support group where she met Augustus, who lost a leg to cancer. Charismatic and sure of himself, the young man quickly becomes close to Hazel, showing him the good side of things. He even manages to find the favorite writer of his new friend, planning a trip to Amsterdam to meet him.<br/><br/>what i find most impressive about this film is the special effects that are absolutely sensational,and the caractersares are very convincing,The chemistry between Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elsort is astounding and the performances were astonishing.also it is beautifully written .<br/><br/>This is the first movie this year that I have given a 10.

","The fault in our stars is about a young cancer patient called Hazel, her
mother is a very supportive character unlike her daughter who prefers to read in bed. Hazel agrees to go to a support group where she meets Isaac and Augustus, Isaac has a form of cancer in his eye and Augustus is a cancer survivor there for Isaac. Augustus and Hazel lock eyes on each other during the group session and start talking afterwards. Soon they become very close and learn to like the same things, Augustus emails one of Hazel's favourite authors and after much time debating, arguing and emails, Hazel and Augustus go to Amsterdam to meet the author, towards the end of the book Augustus and Hazel declare their love for each other but... plot twist. In a way they switch places, as Hazel gets a little bit better Augustus gets worse and then eventually...
My favourite character is Hazel because she has managed to overcome so much and still find love, travel, be a teenager and be able to live a longish happy life. Even when she was told ""no"" she managed to overcome the challenging time of surviving cancer, she is also a really caring character in the book. Hazel really makes you feel like if you try hard enough you can achieve whatever you want."

","I read the book 'the fault in our stars' within the span of 2 days in middle school. I Enjoy the overall plot of the story, but I can't stand the fact John Green made it out as a more romantic storyline and that everyone plays it out to be a 'cancer story'. Now sure I will admit, some things are strongly cancer related, and I know most of the main characters have cancer. But I was going in as a person expecting it to be like 'Blue by Joyce Moyer Hostetter' and came out crying as it was more like an ironically more sad version of 'the hunger Games by Suzanne Collins'. Now, honestly, I loved this story, it caused me to feel an overwhelming amount of depression for a couple of days after reading it, and I honestly can say it has changed my life. It's made me respect the beauty of everything around me, so unless you want to change, I doubt you'll like not only this book, but the movie.
I have to (out of respect) remain quite about the sudden death of someone very important, but have to admit the part where she/he said, ""I lit up like a Christmas tree"" I cried. I've thought the plot of this story more than once over the duration of the past few days (since I've finished it) and I will say, there is no other plausible route for these characters to go other than down. At the beginning they were some-what normal, now their more than just depressed, they are conscious of their insurmountable feelings.
I would suggest this to hopeless romantics, and overall sad and depressed people."

","Known as a heart wrenching film, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is a best-selling novel and film that is meant to put a lump in your throat. The young adult romantic drama is a tale of two cancer affected teens, Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster. Together they battle their sickness and come as one to show what true love really is. The two lovers make the time they have together feel like an eternity. However, it's cut short as they both find out they are slowing dying. Hazel never knew she would end up with a man like Augustus but it was arguably the best thing that ever happened to her. The line, ""The world is not a wish factory"" brings a lot of meaning to this film because both characters continue to suffer, but never wish nothing else but to be together. Many great things make up this amazing film: character relations, scene, and the tone. Both characters connect with their role and make the audience feel something which is important when portraying someone other than you. The scene and dynamic of where it was filmed was absolutely exquisite. The different settings flowed together wonderfully as they go from their hometown Indianapolis to Amsterdam to seek Hazels wish.

","Tonight I watched ""The Fault In Our Stars"". I wasn't ready. Not even close. After pacing through my room for about an hour, I decided to try and write down my thoughts, as scattered as they may be. So here is the weirdest review ever written on IMDb.<br/><br/>The thing with over-romanticizing is that it leaves you with doubts. If I can't be like Hazel and Gus, love like them, then what's the point? And I know I can't be like them. My semi-egocentric brain isn't capable of loving that deeply, that profoundly and unselfishly. They share a connection so beautiful, I'll never have that.<br/><br/>In order to not just give up on love, I have to remind myself that no one is capable of loving like Hazel and Gus. They are fictional characters. Their actions and emotions are exaggerated, in order to make the audience more invested. Too invested, in this case, because I now have to constantly tell myself that they aren't real. Their love isn't real, and I will find love and happiness in my own, real, way.<br/><br/>At this point, many of you will think 'how is this ever a review?' and many more will have stopped reading already. But consider this: if a movie gets a 33 year old man this emotionally invested, how good will it be?"

","This movie is just perfect in my view, everything fits so nicely together. The story, screenplay and above all the acting.. just fantastic. I have never written a review before, seeing this movie just made me to. The cinematography is just great, it is not in your face and helps you to feel part of the story. The casting is so natural especially the lead actors, very well done. the story feels so natural you can relate to, the initial text exchanges, Amsterdam visit,the author's character all feels very realistic. There are so many lighter moments which makes the movie more enjoyable given the subject, I haven't read the book but I am sure I am going to.. Highly recommend this one"

","I really like the idea of 'fixing' a film's average rating by kicking it with a 0 or 10 and I make use of it deliberately, but since this has been happening here extensively enough, I will rather try to offer you a biiit of a mediating evaluation, really because I think that this is not a film which you necessarily have to love OR hate. Apart from that, I am actually still trying to figure out myself what made me like it in the first place - because i did. <br/><br/>In fact if you are, like me, prone to readily dislike a film for being all to cheesy, predictable and like this one bourgeois (as hell!) - you will be struggling trying to watch more than the first two scenes featuring the pretentious, smart-arse make-believe stereotype Gus... some acting is bad, while sometimes character concepts are just the painful thing - and they usually do not coincide here. An in itself very good but in this configuration maybe sometimes very series-like popish soundtrack and suboptimal camera settings are just things I want to have mentioned. It has some lengthy moments and awkward scenes (yep, the Anne Frank house clapping scene is unbearable) and aspects of questionable directing.<br/><br/>...In the end you may still accept the film as a whole - while it has to rely mostly on the few following things: (1) the simple inherent tragedy, that works however rich and white the characters may be and their well-depicted inner conflicts. (2) the great character of Hazel Grace, beautifully represented by Shailene Woodley, who evolves despite some script-related clichéising (...she is also kind of unapproachable...so what?) and (3) its emotional power, because in their moments of genuine weakness (or strength!), the characters are believable and they function.<br/><br/>I think TFIOS really encourages us to see the romanticism, in all its frailty and 'vanity', as a refuge and a beautiful, joyful thing while it is strongest; this innocent and so temporary romantic love as a momentary prospect against oblivion. It is macabre and wondrous at the same time that the two lovers might only have enjoyed the purest form of romantic love in the face of death - but does that change so much about it in general? Anyway, it is a story about teenagers, teenage worlds of thought and maybe ideals - if you do not care about that, you won't enjoy the film either.<br/><br/>Cheers!"

","The relationships were beautifully natural. In this kind of film, we've come to expect the weird, tense and/or overdramatic family/friends with the cancer sufferer the mature-beyond-their-years stable centre of the universe. I'm not going to say that Isaac wasn't a little loopy but hey, we all have one slightly crazy friend, right! I loved watching the friendship and then romance develop between Hazel and Augustus. Again, it was natural, it was fun, it dealt with the reality of their lives and it was marred with tragedy from the get-go.<br/><br/>Living with cancer or another long standing/ life threatening illness has generated a lot of fact and fiction stories, books, movies and documentaries in recent years. What was nice/different about this story was that everyone involved was already at peace with the fact that Hazel would die before her time. There were no big arguments around this fact. It was a sad reality the family lived with, and that was the focus of the story – how they lived despite this. Hazel's concern was that her parents didn't stop when she did go; she wanted them to keep living and not lose purpose. One of the best moments in the film is when they reveal to her that they are preparing for when she is gone.and this makes her happy, not storm out like a drama queen! And can I just say how nice it was to have the protagonist in a relationship that doesn't fall apart when some earth shattering news is dropped! No sad trying to get on with life montage, no big scene argument, just a simple conversation on a bench which pushes the story in a new direction. A relationship which is more about giving than taking, making the other person happy rather than simply enjoying the fact they make you feel good. Yes please.<br/><br/>And unlike My Sister's Keeper, I could quite happily watch it again next week rather than waiting a few years! Full review at confessionsofastorylover.wordpress.com"
"ironhorse_iv","8","0","0","16 February 2016"," This movie has hardly any faults. It was a heart-warming film.
","Faults in Our Stars was a good movie, but be prepared. This is also a tearjerker, coming-of-age tragedy about two ""star-crossed lovers'. So make sure to bring tissue. I cannot tell you, enough, movie, how thankful I am, for our little infinity. I wouldn't trade it for the world. You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I have to say, I'm a huge fan of author John Green's work. Fault in Our Stars is by far, his best novel, yet. Inspired by the autobiography of Esther Grace Earl, a young woman living with cancer, that John Green was friends with, and adapted from the fourth solo YA novel of the same name. The movie version of Fault in Our Stars tells the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) & Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort); two recluse teenagers trying to discover with each other, what does it takes to fall in love, when dealing with a life-threating illness, like cancer. Directed by Josh Boone, the two characters in this film, are very well-rounded and likable, however, I found the casting choices, kinda jarring. Don't get me wrong, Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley did fine in their roles, but it's still kinda weird to see, these two actors play lovers, when their previous released roles was 2014's movie, 'Divergent' in which, they played brother and sister. When you think about it, it's kinda leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Another problem with the film and the book is how kinda disrespectful, it is, to holocaust victim, Anne Frank. I really don't understand, why they added a scene like that. It felt out of place. Were they, trying to be funny and make a Seinfeld reference, or were they trying to say, that every moment of life is precious, and you should try to enjoy, every minute of it. Was it, Hazel and Augustus's usual way of honoring the dead!? I still don't get. Anyway, you put it, it's not a good scene. They should had cut it, or change the settling. Anyways, one scene, I wish, the movie kept was, when Hazel goes to visit Isaac (Nat Wolff) at the hospital following his eye surgery. In the movie, she doesn't do that, and it's seem a little mess up, because he plays a big part in Hazel & Gus's relationship. Yes, it probably would have weighed down the main plot, just to build up Hazel's relationship with Isaac, but audiences may miss a lot of what could had been. Plus, Nat Wolff gave such a quietly heartbreaking performance that he really needed to be revisited. Also, where in the hell is Kaitlyn from the novel? In the movie, Kaitlyn doesn't exist, and it's sad; because she really could had add something to the film. Another missing person from the book is Augustus' former girlfriend Caroline Mathers, who died of brain cancer a few years earlier. This really kinda affects the movie for me, because she supposed to weighs heavily on Hazel's mind on deciding to love and be loved, even when you know it will cause pain. Since there's no mention of Caroline, we never truly know for sure, what is going through Hazel's mind or the effect her death had on Gus. Then, there is the fact, that the movie left out an important scene in which Hazel hear Gus crying and yelling at his mom before they leave on their trip to Amsterdam. In the book, that conversation foreshadows a big return to Gus that I felt would had work, to establish, his struggles. Still, I just glad, they didn't sugarcoat, the powerful and mature story, for these teen audience like they did with 2015's adaptation of Paper Towns, another John Green book. However, I didn't like, how director Boone decided to leave out Hazel's disdain for all the Facebook comments people wrote following Gus' death. In the book, Hazel is infuriated by all the clichéd sentiments and rashly posts something critical of another commenter, assuming Gus would have despised the sympathy notes. Having trolls on the Facebook page would make it, a little more realistic in tone. Anyways, the clever dialogue and writing, is still pretty much here, throughout the film. Yes, it makes the characters seem like their talking like old people, but here's the catch. It's supposed to work that way. Not only is, it's supposed to attract the young adult's crowd, but also the older movie going audience as well. In my opinion, it's rare to see, a movie treat its young people as well educated adults. So, I had no problem with that. Also, I had no problem with the soundtrack for this film. ""Boom Clap"" by Charli XCX might not be, the best written love story, ever. However, it's works for the film. I love the many of fan theories that came out, since this movie came out, like how in-universe, The Fault in Our Stars was written by Peter Van Houten (William Dafoe) or how Hazel writes her own Fan Fic in the An Imperial Affliction universe. Overall: Whatever, people take from this story. It's a great adaptation. Yes, there is some flaws, but it's never drive away, focus on the main story. To quote, Hazel's favorite book, ""pain demands to be felt."" And feel, you will, which is more than okay. So check this movie for your own."

","Lovely film, lovely story and I thank my lovely wife.<br/><br/>My better half insisted that I watch this film and for her I did watch it. I must mention I cried a lot upon watching this. Thanks to the emotions involved. It's a simple story that's very simply told. The beauty lay in the simplicity here. <br/><br/>Two teenagers have health problems and they meet and decide to spend some time together. That's the story line, but one does for another is what the story is all about. Oops, I spilled the story out, oh that is fine because I did not tell even one bit. I must say, I found some similarities to Erich Seagal's ""Love Story"" but that's the end of it. <br/><br/>Life is a journey and it's beautiful when you have the right company. I found mine in my partner, Siri. Yes, I call her Siri and for this journey called life, she is the one I have decided to travel with. I am super happy right now and exploring movies such as this, makes our time more beautiful. <br/><br/>It's a movie that is adapted from the same name and I give credit to the writer of the novel John Green above all. Shailene Woodley gave a super performance here that is worth all the praise and much more. The director did a commendable job in putting the cast right for the story and also getting a just adequate amount of emotions. Never did I feel anything was melodramatic in the tear-jerker. <br/><br/>Watch this to know, how much we are grateful to be fine and happy. This gave me an opportunity to show gratitude to live and to my wife. A 4/5 for this. The love story hangs in the top class league."

Believing she is depressed,Hazel's mother urges her to attend a weekly cancer patient support group to help her make friends who are going through the same thing.Here Hazel meets Augustus Waters a charming teen who lost a leg from bone cancer years earlier but has since been cancer- free,and falls in love with him.He invites Hazel to his house and she accepts, where they bond over their hobbies and agree to read each other's favorite book. Hazel recommends An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels Hazel's experience, and Augustus gives Hazel Counter InsurgenceHazel explains that the novel's mysterious author, Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe), retreated to Amsterdam following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.<br/><br/>Hazel and Augustus arrive in Amsterdam, they get the bus into the city and head to Van Houten's house, but are soon shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic.<br/><br/>After their return to Indianapolis, Augustus' health worsens each week.

At his funeral, Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten in attendance. He tells her he maintained correspondence with Augustus after Amsterdam and that Augustus had demanded he attend his funeral to make up for the spoiled trip. He then tells Hazel that his novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna, who died from leukemia at a young age. Van Houten tries to tell Hazel about the fate of Anna's mother; he gives Hazel a piece of paper. Hazel, still upset with his behavior in Amsterdam, crumples up the paper and asks him to leave. Later, talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Augustus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her. She retrieves the crumpled paper and reads Augustus' words, which state his acceptance of death and his love for Hazel. Hazel lies on her back on her lawn looking up at the stars, smiling as she remembers Augustus and says ""Okay"".<br/><br/>It's moving and very meaning you should watch it =))"

","I took many months to watch this movie after it released. I knew about this film from someone review about this story and my crush, after I stalked her social account. Then I got this movie from my friend. By the way, before I want to watch this movie , my cousin told me that it is a sad movie and my friends also said that this movie is best, they said. So, I asked myself, is it really sad like my heart was going jump-out like I was watching Titanic before? It really made me want to watch this movie. <br/><br/>But the real sadness was, I already found the spoiler(little bit as a spoiler) before when I was scrolling my time line on twitter and It seems happen the same in the movie. End up, the story not sad at all after I finished watching it. I don't know if I didn't feel sad because of that spoiler or the story feelings can't cross my heart at all. However, I still can feel the sadness and sickness that the Hazel feels. Yes, I'm still into romantic movies. My open-minded about any genres of film happened after that Titanic film, sigh.<br/><br/>The story start with the narrative by the main character, Hazel Lancaster. Which is for me it is just good. I'm not the fan of the novel of this adaptation and I also never read it before. I also knew that there are many quotes or an impact dialog in this story that has brought up in this movie, nice. For me, the plot is not too slow and not too rush , it well organised. The ""sad moment"" not really gave an impact for me, maybe due to the spoiler as I point out in this writing. What I really love is the scene when they are, Hazel and Augustus going to meet the novel writer of Van Houten that they really admire in Amsterdam. It is really unexpected 'tragedy' happen in their meeting, for me it the cause of the story is getting interesting and this scene has a thing to do with the ending.<br/><br/>Lastly, I tried to watch it back but for me this movie isn't powerful enough to push me for watching this again."
"Cat-Wings","8","0","0","14 November 2015"," So, what was an Imperial Affliction?
","The Fault In Our Stars is a love story about a teenage cancer girl (Hazel Grace) and a survivor of cancer boy with one leg (Augustus Water), and a sequence of drama surrounding their families and friends from a cancer community group. I usually don't read books or watch films in which I could guess the story is going to be a sad ending. I like John Green, a famous author of young adult books, and read a couple of his books including ""Paper Town"" and ""An Abundance of Katherines."" I bought this book when I took a few pages at a book store.<br/><br/>The story is unexpected in a good way with a sprinkle of the author's jokes and humors through the characters, and it's no just a cancer girl story who has a miserable and painful life with supporting family and friends. One of the things I like about the story is that Hazel and Augustus get to know each other through her favorite book, An Imperial Affliction, written by Peter Van Houten. The vague ending of the book has caught her for years to eager to ask questions to the author, and that makes the two teens fly to Amsterdam to meet the author. It's very dramatic and exciting scenes in that a story is created in places from two countries, as well as it makes the handicapped characters overcome the difficulties of traveling for their dream.<br/><br/>The whole story about An Imperial Affliction never described, but quotations from the book leave footprint stunningly, seemingly that that casts a meaning of life through conversations between Hazel and Augustus. While the story of An imperial Affliction sounds epic, Van Houten's quirky and socially twisted personality disappoints the two teems. But the trip in Amsterdam builds their bond more tightly, and the story is going to be a moving ending. <br/><br/>This is not entirely a sad story, but it involves with sadness and heartbreak towards the characters. After the story ended, I felt it satisfied me as if a missing piece is matched into the story, rather than it left out only sadness.<br/><br/>On the same day I finished the book, I watched the film of The Fault In Our Stars. Shailene Woodley portrays Hazel so well, and Peter Van Houten, played by Willem Dafoe, matches the original image."

","Summary: The Fault in Our Stars compensates for its flaws with Shailene Woodley's performance and tear-jerking moments. 63/100 (C+)<br/><br/>The Fault in Our Stars is a pretty passable and forgettable film. That's why I give it a 6/10. It's far from being a bad film, but it wasn't very special either. I read the amazing book few days before watching the film, and I have to say that the book was breathtaking and deeply emotional. It is filled with lots of funny moments and also, painfully sad moments. The last chapters made me feel so many emotions at once. Then appears this mediocre and sometimes heartless adaptation. It was so disappointing because it does not reach that emotional impact from the book. The movie feels so rushed (even with its 126 minutes of running time).<br/><br/>It was so straight to the point, there was not enough character development. My major issue with this film is that each scene feels so mediocre and emotionally empty. Also, when it tries to be funny ends up being awkwardly humorless. Another problem is the lazy screenplay, the writer changed a huge part of the original script and some of the scenes were so badly scripted and awfully directed. I mean, the actions and the way that this talented actors interacted between each other in dramatic scenes were not similar to the book at all. What a shame because the book took more risks. It was braver.<br/><br/>Another problem is that there were not enough characters. A lot of important characters from the book were not in the film. Come on, the director had enough running time to put them in, but he didn't. Also, I didn't feel that connection between Hazel, Gus, and that book called ""An Imperial Affliction"". You don't know anything about this book that they love, they just barely talked about it throughout the film and there were not enough conversations about this beloved book in the film. But I'm happy that there were some decent moments here. All the scenes in Amsterdam were beautifully shot and very similar to the book in all the right ways. It was definitely the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>All those moments in Amsterdam were very enjoyable and beautiful because there was a lot of chemistry between these two main characters. Shailene Woodley was terrific, she was born to play this role. It's sad that this director went for the easy way and didn't put lots of important and crucial moments from the book in the film. The DVD version has some extra minutes, but it's just not enough. Overall, The Fault in Our Stars is a mediocre and empty film compared to the book, but it definitely has its moments and the performances were terrific. Sorry if I mentioned the word ""book"" so many times in this review, but I can't stop comparing them. (C+)"

","Based on a 2012 novel by the same name by John Green, The fault in our stars is a romantic splendor sure to make your tear ducts work. This is a story of Hazel Grace (played by Shailene Woodley), a cancer diagnosed girl breathing with the help of a nose cannula, and her ""the world is not a wish-granting factory"" experience and moments. Hazel meets an impossibly charming boy next door, Augustus Walters (played by Ansel Elgort) suffering from a prosthetic leg, at a cancer support group and gradually starts liking him. She is moved by a book she reads, An Imperial Affliction, which ends mid- sentence, and she is very animated to know what happens later to the protagonist. Augustus helps her in meeting the author by traveling to Amsterdam (under critical medical condition), but poor Hazel has to return disappointed as the author behaves scornfully with the young couple. The story further continues with Augustus showering magic in Hazel's life and mesmerizing her, and finally ends on a forlorn note.<br/><br/>Sadly, book readers have not found the movie as delightful as the novel (which is a case with any novel based movie), however the movie stands beautifully as a pure romantic piece in recent times. Set in Indiana, the movie has been neatly shot with delicate art designing and editing. The fault in our stars is about love, pain and memories & is highly recommended for a young adult audience."

","Two teenage cancer survivors find each other and fall in love – sort of sounds like a trashy romance novel, an After School Special, or a Lifetime movie. Yet, somehow, this adaptation of the best-selling novel moves beyond those melodramatic hazards into a touching portrayal. <br/><br/>Shailene Woodley continues her string of good to great performances and her march towards stardom. Ms. Woodley and Ansel Elgort provide the grace, charm and lift which takes the storyline (and sometimes dialog) laden with potential pitfalls into an engaging film about growing up, love and loss.

","Review: What an emotional movie! It's not very often that a film brings a tear to my eye, especially when it's based around 2 unknown stars and a storyline without any twist and turns. I also smiled all the way through the film because it was great to see Gus and Hazel's relationship blossom under extreme circumstances. Basically the movie is about 2 teenagers who are suffering with cancer and they fall in love with each other, even though there life could come to an end due to there illness. There's many different elements to the storyline which makes it so brilliant but I don't want to spoil it for those people who haven't watched it. The performances are so realistic and deeply emotional which is why I couldn't help but feel for Hazel & Gus. Although the movie is based around two characters, the director cleverly introduced new characters throughout the movie to keep it fresh and interesting. For a 2 hour movie, I really didn't want it to end, which surprised me for a movie in this genre. It could have easily been a morbid movie because of the touchy subject matter, but it really was a joy to watch and it's proof that you don't need major stars and a big budget to make a great film. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Round-Up: This is definitely one of those movies were you have to take time out after you watch it, because it's an emotional roller-coaster. You might remember the girl from Divergent and The Descendants and the boy also starred in Divergent and Carrie but they aren't household names yet. I'm sure after this movie they will get a huge amount of work, which they deserve after putting in such great performances. Even Willem Dafoe, who only had a tiny role, was brilliant along with Laura Dean who plays the girls mother. In all, if your into your emotional dramas then this is definitely a movie for you and I'm really not surprised that it blew up at the box office.<br/><br/>Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $304million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their really emotional movies about 2 teenagers suffering with cancer and manage to fall in love under extreme circumstances. 8/10"

","I'm a guy, so I don't watch chick films or shows unless there's at least something to appeal to men as equally. I figured this would be a typical clichéd sappy love story we've seen before for, like, the 100 time. Surprise surprise! I was proved wrong. I've watched JeremyJahns review this and I refused to believe what he said because he reviewed and liked the Nightmare on Elm Street remake. Apparently, I'm an idiot. This is not just a love story, it's a drama. Two young people suffering from different cancers get together and start becoming friends first even though one of them has an attraction to the other by appearances, but still taking it slow nonetheless; seems logical, and eventually fall in love. And then there you have it. They live out there lives. This reminds me of ""The Bucket List"" These two know the cancer will kill them but they never let it destroy them. They take it in stride--for the most part. I recently saw Shailene Woodley in ""Divergent"" and thought she did okay; the movie kind of felt like a Hunger Games knock-off. But in this? Good lord! She gave an astounding performance of her life. Not once did it feel like she could have done one part a little more or less. I smell an Oscar coming her way! Also, she's freaking beautiful! I think I like her better with short hair. Ansel Elgort does a good job as well. I like that he's this kind of 'I don't care. I'll do whatever I want' guy, but never to a point when he's being a d!ck about it. <br/><br/>All in all, it's an impressive love story that doesn't feel clichéd, old, or very...what's the word? Tweenish. I won't say it's the most realistic love story ever put on screen, but it's more realistic than the usual love stories we get nowadays."

","Movie runs at variable pace. Sometimes, the story runs too fast so that you are not able to feel what characters are feeling. Other times when director wants to throw some solid dialogues and wants the viewers to appreciate them, he makes it go slow. He cuts way too many scenes but naah... not the dialogues. He adjusts the dialogues of those deleted scenes elsewhere. Many a times, he desperately put okay–okay thing to create the effect even when it is not fitting the situation. Secondly, the movie is too straight forward. Everything is served on a plate for the viewers so much so that they are not required to think what is going to come-up next.

This emotional and heartwarming story describes us the life of two teenagers who are suffering of cancer and fighting for every day of their lives.<br/><br/>This film is telling us the story of Hazel Grace, a cancer patient who is pushed by her mom to join a support group to change the way she sees the life, where she meets Augustus Waters, who came there to support his best friend Isaac, who has an eye cancer . That's where this romance starts.<br/><br/>The seventeen years old Hazel Grace has lung cancer and needs to carry everywhere an oxygen tank. When she goes to the cancer support group against her will, she meets the eighteen years old Gus, who lost part of one leg with cancer but apparently, is cured. They fall in love with each other. Unfortunately, the infinity of these teenagers is limited. They will never know how to get older together. Their days are numbered, the fate has already decided for them.<br/><br/>Actors are ideally chosen for this movie. Shailene Woodley, who played Hazel Grace in the movie ""Fault In Our Stars"", has done a perfect job by acting without any flaws. This wonderful actress transmits all her feelings through the screen directly to the audience. Also, Ansel Elgort, who was interpreting the lover of Hazel, Gus, did not disappoint our expectations. He makes us fall in love with his character by the way he presents it. For those reasons, after release of this movie, these two young talented people became famous. Additionally, other actors, such as Nat Wolff(Isaac, best friend of Gus), Laura Dern(mother of Hazel), Sam Trammel ( father of Hazel) and William Dafoe(the writer) are also admirable.<br/><br/>Soundtracks also played an important role in this movie. They immerse us into unforgettable atmosphere of this wonderful story. From my point of view the best one is ""Boom Clap"" that is sang by Charli XCX. In fact, that amazing song had made its singer famous all over the world.<br/><br/>The way Gus puts Hazel in the first place is one of the most beautiful parts of the movie.For example, in the beginning of the relationship Hazel Grace has a dream of seeing her favorite writer, who wrote a novel about cancer that gives her hope. However, she couldn't fly to see him. When Gus sees how important this writer is for her, he does the impossible to make her see him. Moreover, we really admire how resilient and purposeful they are no matter how bad their sickness is during the film. For instance, the moment when Hazel is climbing the stairs despite the fact that she was in a really difficult condition is the illustration of a strong spirit.<br/><br/>This beautiful story teaches us to never lose hope, and be able to fight for what we want no matter how difficult it is ,as in the end the people who are trying the hardest, reach their dreams the most. Additionally, it helps us to learn that we have to enjoy every day of our lives, as it is our last day to live on the Earth, as we never know what tomorrow is preparing for us. As strong language is briefly used in the movie, and there is some sexuality this film is rated PG-13. I strongly recommend it to teenagers who like love stories with unexpected endings to not miss this movie. However, I would not suggest this film to those who don't like real tragedies. Also, I would like to mention that this is one of the best movies that has ever been released, because this is not just movie-it is infinity. There are no doubts that it is a new level of drama of worldwide movies. World is the bustle, hurry, finding yourself, it is surviving .We spend it to no purpose without understanding the importance of our life.<br/><br/>In addition,I would like to give ""A"" grade to this movie as this drama really touched my heart while I was watching it. I can consider this film as one of those that you can watch over again and keep feeling the same emotions as the first time.<br/><br/>To sum up, I would like to talk a bit about the person who has written this review-Gulmira Kalimbetova. She is a 19 years old student who is majoring in international business in Guangdong University of Foreign studies in Guangzhou city of South East China. Gulmira has a lot of hobbies. The main one is reading books as she is sure that books broad our horizons of knowledge. She also likes to play tennis and volleyball. She is a resilient person who always follows her dreams. She is a heart of her company as she is talkative and kind person."

","I have refused to watch this movie ever since it came out . I guess it was because I thought it was one of the cheesy romance dramas that have been flavored with classic cancer story. I could not be wronger. This movie not only exceeded my expectations but it made me regret every single second that I wasted with not watching this movie. It is not a classic cancer story. It has twists and turns. It has the element of ""the unexpected"". It is one of the movies make you happy and sad at the same time. John Green did an outstanding job with this story but I believe the movie also deserves credit. I think the is well-shot. The actors chosen for this movie could not be any better. Also I believe the director did an amazing job."

","At the risk of sounding like some type of Grinch or cold hearted meanie, The Fault in Our Stars left me strangely unaffected. Sure there are many moments within this cancer set tale that are quiet emotional but to say that they are overwhelming affecting would be a lie for the Fault in Our Stars is a well-made movie with some fine acting especially by Shailene Woodley but nothing here struck me as wholly original and when you look at the success of the John Green source material, it feels like there was more for this movie to give.<br/><br/>I can't claim to have read Green's book but from many acquaintances that have, it seemed like a witty, smart and touching tale of young love and the horrible disease that is cancer. It would be interesting to hear from those people that were touched by the book and there experience with this film for a while as mentioned Woodley is great in her role as Hazel Grace Lancaster all other players feel somewhat slight and untrue with Ansel Elgort's Augustus a fast talking and hyperactive persona who is supposed to be endearing, but comes off as an untrue like love interest. Hazel and Gus's relationship should've felt more engaging here as well and unlike the book it seems to have missed the mark in making a love story for the ages and for young teenagers everywhere. Dialogue also that may have popped off the page in the book feels a little tripe on screen and comes off as either to mawkish or grandstanding to ring true for the viewer.<br/><br/>Without Woodley's top notch performance the film finds some much needed intrigue in the important yet not overly used Willem Dafoe as Amsterdam based author Peter Van Houten. Dafoe's character is sadly far more interesting than Augustus ever is and it shows up the fact that this central figure is less the sum of his parts. Director Boone also gives the film a nice feel, his direction is breezy and effective (although there is an overuse of an Indie set music soundtrack) and in material that could of gone full steam ahead on all things Nicholas Sparks like, it's nice that he doesn't overplay things although at times as mentioned things feel a little too cold and you start to wonder just what you're supposed to be taking away from all of this sadness? A great movie for teenage girls and all those with similar emotional ties, Fault in our Stars is a nice movie but that's about it. Woodley is the main reason to watch this film as she is consistently showcasing an acting talent that blows most other young performers out of the water, yet the film could've been so much more than the Hallmark tale it has seemingly ended up as. Mind you perhaps I am just a Grinch or a cold hearted meanie? As when this tale ended, so did my thinking about it and this movie clearly wanted to be a life affirming journey that makes people hug there closest by loved one.<br/><br/>2 and a half un-lit cigarettes out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check into - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","The Fault in Our Stars is a 2014 American romantic comedy-drama film directed by Josh Boone. The film stars Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, and Nat Wolff, with Laura Dern, Sam Trammell, and Willem Dafoe playing supporting roles. Woodley plays Hazel Grace Lancaster, a sixteen-year- old cancer patient who is forced by her parents to attend a support group, where she subsequently meets and falls in love with Augustus Waters, played by Ansel Elgort. Hazel and Gus are two extraordinary teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps them - and us - on an unforgettable journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous, given that they met and fell in love at a cancer support group. THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, based upon the number-one bestselling novel by John Green, explores the funny, thrilling and tragic business of being alive and in love."

","The good ones are the hardest to write about. My thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations...<br/><br/>The Fault in Our Stars (henceforth TFiOS) is a story of first love, of how to deal with loss and the business of dying, of giving a number from 1 to 10 to the pain you are feeling, and a wake up call to how you want to play the game of life with the cards you are dealt with. The teenage lovers depicted in TFiOS are cancer sufferers stage IV. <br/><br/>It sounds like one pretentiously powered to the nth degree emotional manipulative tale. IMHO it isn't and has this almost evangelical sheen gleaming like a halo at the seams. It breaks your heart not because it's sad. It does that by swelling your heart with beauty until it burst. It's sad but it's also very funny and insightful, with the right blend of levity and honesty. It tackles big subjects - life, death, love. And it does it amazingly well, constantly buoyant with a hope even in the face of death. I know the book first and the movie feels like the actual movie that played in my head when I read the book. The movie is extremely faithful to the book. <br/><br/>Movies of this sort live or die on one thing - the chemistry between the leads. The chemistry is spot-on perfect. The two are kindred spirits, sharing an irreverent sense of humor and immense charm, and watching them fall in love even as they face universal questions of the human condition - How will I be remembered? Does my life, and will my death, have meaning? - is deeply moving. Shailene Woodley, I know since The Descendants and The Spectacular Now. But they IMHO are not ""sit up in your seat and see me"" material. I see Woodley not as a young Jennifer Lawrence, but an actress with a sweet fragility. TFiOS is her star making role. She embodies the role of Hazel Grace Lancaster so well I couldn't see another actress in it. Love how she plays her - she is not your archetypal teenager suffering from cancer. Ansel Elgort, I only know from Carrie in a dumb role. His performance is pitch-perfect and winsome. Together they are simply marvelous (I know both of them played sister and brother in Divergent but I have yet to see it).<br/><br/>The supporting cast did a superb job too and each of them has good scenes to shine in. I thought Willem Dafoe was superbly cast as Van Houten. He totally imbues the character of a bile-spitting curmudgeon. I hate him but I also pity him. <br/><br/>If I have to nitpick, I would say Dafoe's character is the weak spot. He feels like a simple plot device right at the end. In book form, I could see the over-arching purpose, but in the film his purpose seems simplified. But I am really nitpicking and scrapping the bottom of the barrel. IMHO TFiOS is near flawless and for a runtime of over 2 hours, we didn't feel the narrative was long drawn. And it has one of the most creative and cutest ways of showing SMSes and emails on screen (I bet it will be copied soon). It's a movie that like pain, demands to be felt and I hope people will fall in love with it like how we fall asleep, slowly at first and then all at once."
"nojok100","5","4","13","6 June 2014"," Great movie, but only if you want to be sad...
","Let me start out by clarifying something: this was a great movie! It was excellently directed, the plot elements were not predictable (unless you read the book), the cast was perfectly picked, and is everything one would expect from this movie, though I hear (spoiler) that one character was omitted (I wouldn't have known, as I never read the book). Now, that being said, it was also exactly as I expected it to be, and not in a good way. Thus, this movie really deserves two reviews- one for people who enjoy sad movies, and one for those who do not. If you like movies that make you cry and/or feel particularly distraught and almost depressed, then you'll love this movie. My girlfriend is one of those people, and despite being in tears for ~2/3 of the movie, she loved the movie. If you're like me and strongly dislike tear-jerker style movies, you will not find this movie enjoyable. It is that simple. I went into this movie expecting it to put me in a bad mood for days, and the movie lived up to those expectations perfectly. It has perfectly-timed emotional attacks, with the dry humor failing to lighten the tone to more than an infinitesimal degree. I was actually relieved when it ended, not because of the quality of the movie, but because I really could not bear to watch something so sad. I have no plans of watching this movie again. So, you can see that the sentiments about this movie are somewhat polarized. Therefore, I divide up the rating into two, five-star categories: 5/5 for those who like sad stories, and 0/5 for those who do not, because sadness is really the primary element of this movie."

","""The world is not a wish-granting factory.""<br/><br/>Sound the distress signal! No pile is safe!<br/><br/>My advice to the tissues out there : slip from the top pocket, whisk yourself into the aisle, and cloak yourself behind a tossed popcorn bucket. The alternative? Slime – and lots of it. From the eyes to the nose to the wet debris of the cheeks it will come, and there'll be nowhere to hide!<br/><br/>""The Fault in Our Stars"" will single-handedly spike the Kleenex death toll.<br/><br/>Based on the similarly eye-flooding book of the same name, ""Stars"" is a very sweet but sad teen romance that educates and enriches as much it entertains. Unlike most other films that carry the 'youngsters in love' tag, it's set in our world – as opposed to that bl-inky-eyed, butterfly- buzzing haven beyond the screen where Michael Schoeffling and Molly Ringwald come together at a kitchen table for a 16th birthday kiss, and Freddie Prinze Jr manages to convince Rachel Leigh-Cook he's more than the weight of his jock jacket. This 'anti' teen-romance movie is grounded, devoid of fluff, does away with a 'happily ever after' ending, and mostly, skips on the OMD. And the pragmatism is what transports ""The Fault in Our Stars"" to a whole next galaxy, far beyond the juvenile romances of cinema yesteryear.<br/><br/>As our lead character says at the beginning of the film, ""I believe we have a choice in this world about how to tell sad stories. On the one hand, you can sugarcoat it. Nothing is too messed up that can't be fixed with a Peter Gabriel Song. I like that version as much as the next girl does. It's just not the truth.""<br/><br/>You've had plenty of fruit salad, now it's time to dig into the chicken breast – it's good for you.<br/><br/>Hazel (Shailene Woodley) describes herself as a ticking time bomb – but Cancer will do that. She seems to be just waiting around for the boom. And fair enough. Though not big on socializing, her mother's insistence leads her to a support group, there she immediately catches the eye of courteous Gus (Ansel Elgort), who lost a leg to the disease. He's only there supporting a friend. Hazel and Gus begin to grow closer – thanks to a mutual love of movies, music and literature – and things get serious just as Hazel's health takes a turn for the worse.<br/><br/>""I am in love with you Hazel Grace"", responds Gus. ""And I know that love is just a shout into the void and that oblivion is inevitableand I am in love with you. All of your efforts to keep me away from you are going to fail.""<br/><br/>A secondary subplot strings the main thread together. Hazel's found comfort in a book about a young girl, also with Cancer, who feels exactly the same about the disease as she does. The book leaves her hanging though – it doesn't give her the answers she's looking for, so she writes to the author who invites her to meet in Amsterdam. With the assistance of her ever-loving beau Gus, Hazel's able to convince her doctors that she should be allowed to take the trip and so sets off – with boyfriend and mother (Laura Dern) in tow – to Amsterdam to get the answers she so desires. The trip is a memorable one for a whole different set of reasons.<br/><br/>It's the realism of ""Stars"" that sees it effortlessly make out with the lump in your throat. From the credible and amazing performances of its two leads (Shailene Woodley has emerged as one of today's best young actresses – here, she embodies true leading-lady potential; Ansel Elgort is as equally as good, serving up a wide-ranging, eye-catching and likable performance) to the realistic but heartbreaking story being told (you know walking in, there's not going to be a happy ending for anyone here), there's nothing inauthentic about the film. I pinched the reel – and its reflex suggested it was the real deal. True. Not a false beat in director Josh Boone's orchestra.<br/><br/>In its depiction of terminal illness, Boone's adaptation doesn't attempt to evoke sympathy from the audience, nor does it ask you to pity the lives the leads have been granted. The film almost offers a positive spin – not unlike Gus does every few minutes in the movie – on cancer, reminding audiences that until you've breathed your last breath, you're still alive and should embrace that. Inspiring. It also reminds that even a short but well-lived life is far from a waste — one can search forever for that special thing that makes their life complete or, like Hazel and Gus, they can find it in just a few months.<br/><br/>""You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I can't tell you how they cry out for a little infinity.""<br/><br/>""The Fault in Our Stars"" is a movie that will ultimately still stir sniffles and flip smiles (particularly knowing how it's going to turn out for the central characters), but it might also slap a few of the living dead out there into a new beginning, where they'll start to make the most of their being.<br/><br/>Everyone will get something out of this – but especially those who've been working themselves over for months to years on end because of something that was out of their hands. Find happiness where you can, push on even when you think you can't, and keep the tragic losses locked behind the padlock guarding your heart – after all, they're yours. ""I will not tell you our love story, because—like all real love stories— it will die with us, as it should."" Amen."
"videodrome1234","8","3","9","30 May 2014"," Big surprise
","The YA book adaptations as the name suggest is a genre for teens. And what do teens care about? Love, yeah a bunch of other things too, but that's exactly why I never got why they can't make an adaptation where there are real emotions radiating from the screen, just so you know, it can be taken seriously. It's never come together for me, maybe with the exception of Hunger Games but the love story isn't the most important thing there anyway. Twilight is the example where it was the worst, the books had feeling but the films were a parody of love. Okay so what do you need to successfully adapt a book? Professionals. That's where Twilight went wrong, but it looks like the other film studios are starting to learn from others mistakes and when Fox acquired the rights to the Fault in Our Stars (John Green's positively critiqued romantic novel from 2012) they set out to let professionals handle the film. 'Cause it's to their advantage to make a good film so they'll make money. First off they got a young but talented director, one who knows a thing or two about romantic dramas. And they gave the script to The Spectacular Now's and the 500 Days of Summer's genius writer. This was a great step because The Spectacular Now was one of the best romantic films of the last little while. And then they cast Shailene Woodley and another Divergent cast member Ansel Elgor. So is that really all you need for a good film? Looks like it. The director does his job well. The adaptation was done well, you don't feel like something is missing if you haven't read the book. It's not really much cinematography wise, but the realistic way it was done was good for this production, and it really brings showcases the teenage atmosphere. The script works, it gives us great characters, it's just a little predictable but because of the theme I figure the book is the same. The actors are great in their roles, and what I found even better that their acting doesn't start and end with being sick. That's not the only layer of their character, that's just a status. Most romances make the mistake that they are too far fetched and cover the screen in rose colored goop. How cares if 1000 plus people died on a sinking boat, their love affair ended! Well this film isn't like that. It reacts of reality. It's like it could happen to any one of our friends. Maybe that's why it hits so hard. Even when it has the requisite romantic goop, it feels like they are based in reality. It's also a great thing about the film that the romantic story line isn't even the central theme it's just a means to help us see how they come of age. This becoming an adult theme has the added drama with their medical histories, but the film is helped out with the occasional humor that isn't taken to the extreme. All in all The Fault in Our Stars (that quotes Shakespeare with its title) is one of the best YA adaptations and romantic dramas. Of course it can't knock Notebook off its throne but it's up there. So I give it a 8/10 https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1"
"ggodoymm1","10","2","5","28 August 2014"," Why the did I do this to myself?
","This is my first review(rant), having just finished the movie (a little late I know, I just didn't care enough to watch it in theaters), and I had to get this out, I don't cry easily in movies, but when I do, I'm not shy about it, because that's the whole point of fiction to evoke emotion, and if a movie/book/TV show has managed to do that to me, it just means said work of fiction has done it's job.<br/><br/>Now that being said, I went in to this movie sort of knowing the ending, and what to expect, having waited this long to watch it, I just couldn't completely avoid spoilers or hearing how people have reacted to it (i.e. tears), what I could not predict was turning this seething mass of tears, pain and snot.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my point, why in Thor's name did I do this to myself? Because stories like this add to the human condition, they enrich our mundane lives, pain however bad it might seem at the time, is better than being numb.<br/><br/>This an excellent film, one which I regret not watching sooner, because in spite of knowing how it was going to turn out, right from the beginning it still managed to grip me, imagine how much more I could have enjoyed it had caught me by surprise.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is, if you're on the fence about watching this movie (as I was) because of the demographic of it's fans or the YA tag, don't be it stands on its own as just a really good story, you don't need to be a teenage girl to enjoy this."
"kinval2007","4","2","5","28 August 2014"," Soi..So BAD
","I don't usually write movie reviews but this one just had me waste the time to do so. How in God's name can this be rated over 8? The movie is so full of clichés that it had me gasping for air much like the female star.<br/><br/>I can't understand how they could take such an emotional subject as the love story between two terminally ill teenagers and DRAIN it of all emotion. The movie is so predictable it is scary and beyond that it fails to make you as a viewer care for their fate at all.<br/><br/>Unrealistic pretentious and without substance but hey...it's about kids with cancer of course we are going to sing it's praises. I'm almost starting to see Van Houten's point of view.<br/><br/>And my final question is ...what movie have you people giving it rave reviews been watching???"

","Having read the book first I was excited but also very sceptical to watch this movie. I love the book and of course I was afraid the movie would just not be as good as the book was. And I am very glad that it didn't disappoint me. The movie was very true to the book, there was really only one scene I was missing and nothing was majorly changed. The main actors were really good and I believe that is what made this movie as good as it is. But it's also the small stuff - rooms looked exactly like I've imagined them when I was reading the book and even when I first saw Ansel he looked just like how I'd imagined Gus to look. I don't really know of anyone who has read the book and hated it so my guess is that you will enjoy this movie. It has - just like the book - a bit of everything, from humor to sadness. At the beginning I felt like things were going too quickly, but a lot happens in the book. I also felt that some actors couldn't be as serious as they needed to be. Luckily the main actors were perfect and the ending had the right effect (even though I knew how it was going to end). I loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone."
"tukamark","10","2","5","27 August 2014"," Infinity in a finite life.
","It is very hard to form coherent thoughts and sentences after seeing this movie, just as likely after reading the amazing book by John Green. The fault in our stars is definitely a masterpiece, in every single way. When I first heard about it, I thought this will be yet another teen love story, with no original thoughts whatsoever. Boy, was I wrong. First of all, the book is perfectly written, the story and the characters are so real, when you start to read it, you will immediately jump into the John Green created world, and well, that is a roller-coaster ride that only goes up. I saw a lot of tearjerker movies that had something to do with cancer or illness, but I have never saw a movie that was so artistically and perfectly wrapped up in this psychological universe, which was filled with wisdom. The movie not only shows us a love story, it also tries to get you thinking about the finite life, and at the same time, its infinity. However, what truly is remarkable, the fact that it does that in such a down to earth way. Not heavy quotes and out of reach definitions, just simple, yet powerful thoughts that are going through well-organized minds. <br/><br/>The movie adaptation I have to say was certainly not a let down. I was really scared to watch this after reading the perfection that book was, but I am glad I watched it. Shaileene and Ansel were great choices for Hazel and Augustus, they are great actors, and they really grasped the essence of the characters. The milieu and the whole environment of the movie was very similar to the book's, director Josh Boone did an amazing job. The monologues were spot on, ad the saddest scenes in the books were truly the saddest scenes in the movie. <br/><br/>It is really hard to create something extraordinary in today's world. John Green, you did that. And for that, you will be remembered. You are loved widely, and I am sure, you are loved deeply. Because, that is all that matters. Thank you for giving a world some infinity within this finite life."

","I loved it! I cried for almost the last 45 minutes of the movie. It's one of movies that you have to bring tissues. It's definitely a chick flick. The people on the team that made the movie cast the right actors and actresses to play the main characters. John Green is one of the best authors for young adult romance. I read the book, but don't really remember some of the major plot, so i can't really compare the book to the movie. It's a movie that i would buy when it comes out on DVD. I think it's going to be like The Breakfast Club for me, I'll be able to watch over and over again and it'll never get old. The part i don't like about the whole story is the way Peter Van Houten treats Hazel Grace, he acts like a total jerk, and they definitely picked the right actor to play his part, Willem Dafoe. I just want to say that i recommend it to all the people who've read the book or like romance."

","A young love clouded by death. Two attractive young people, fall in love so what is the problem? Well, they met at a cancer support group and both have terminal cancer.<br/><br/>This is a very unlikely love story. It has all the elements of a rom-com but it is a drama through and through. Attraction, excitement are all there but with a nasty reality bite. Each of them knows they are dying soon but for the moment they are concerned not losing the person they love, or hurt them. <br/><br/>On the whole, it was made in a way that displays all angles in such an unfortunate story. First person, immediate family and partner. It is one thing for the person concerned to know they are to pass soon, but what about the parents involved knowing they are about to lose a child? It is just harrowing.<br/><br/>In the midst of it all, comes romance. It was resisted, at times rejected, but in this tower of gloom perhaps it was the only breath of fresh air that made sense.<br/><br/>Go see it and rejoice life. Do take note however, this is not a (first) date movie."

I sat there crying my eyes out when SPOILER ALERT: Gus died I mean it came out of nowhere but it was a true tragedy. The trailers make it look like a chick flick but honestly it is not anyone would think that Gus was perfectly fine but once he tells Hazel that he has cancer all over and he only has weeks left it shows strength determination and best of all love An amazing film based on an amazing book.

","""The Fault in our stars"" starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort is an incredible movie,appealing to both adults and teenagers.The script, plot and the performances of all the actors are great and also notable is the chemistry between Shailene and Ansel.The lines are REALLY good and through the lives of Hazel and Gus(teenagers that suffer from cancer)you can realize deeper truths.It's an emotional and dramatic film and I think it's hard not to cry(especially in the end)...so be prepared... For all these reasons and many more you'll understand while watching the movie, I gave it a 9 because even-though i like action films and adventures, these movie ""touched"" me so much and i would watch it again again!(with a tissue package of course:P)"
"kuvilovesthefandoms","10","2","5","30 June 2014"," Great Job!
","OMG! I loved it! It was absolutely phenomenal! They really stuck to the book (Yay!) and even had most of the actual dialogs.- Which you don't really see in some other movies. So I was very proud and excited!!! I think the cast really was really great and I wouldn't have changed the cast at all, the actors and actresses really pulled it off. It was an awesome, tearful, and romantic movie; I'll make sure to get it on DVD. Thumbs up! :) Thank you for making the wonderful book into a visual, making it even more precious. The book will always be remembered, and now the movie! Awesome job to the people who helped make the book come to life! Great job!"

","I haven't watched the movie yet, but the story is awesome! It's funny, sad, romantic, it's got everything!! The storyline is fun, not boring, full of surprises! I love how John Green could feed me with such complete story, i love him ^^ And, I can't wait too watch the movie, so excited!!! I love all the details, all of the characters and all of the conflicts. The sad moments really bring me down, and the funny moments make me laugh... I can'r wait to watch the movie, really, and if someone tells you they don't like this movie of whatever, they don't have hearts. Trust me, watch this movie and you won't be disappointed! Cheers!"

","First I want to start of by telling that I haven't read the book. Also, I'm a guy so normally this isn't the kind of movie I go for. btw: this is the first time I write a review and I'm still a noob at it so please consider it that way. and this review MAY contain spoilers. <br/><br/>Usually I try to avoid romantic movies, because let's face it: a lot of them are very similar to one another. I did like 'Perks of being a wallflower' if I'd had to give an exception.<br/><br/>but today a friend of mine asked to go to 'the Fault in our stars' and half-unwillingly I accompanied her. to sum the movie up really quickly: two teenagers suffering from cancer fall in love. the story is fresh and although it's a heavy subject, the way that it's being handled by the director and the cast makes it more accessible and sometimes even funny, it's no depressing flick. it gets you to think too: people suffering from terminal diseases not only have to wait for death (sorry for the perhaps cruel way of saying this) but they also have to face the fact that they're leaving their family and loved ones behind and that they'll cause them a lot of pain once they're gone. I think the story is partly about that.<br/><br/>as I said: I'm an amateur so I think I'll just conclude with the fact that they really made the script work (or the book) by for example their 'okay' (you'll know what I mean when you see the movie). <br/><br/>as long as you don't forget to bring the tissues I think a lot of people, even men or non-romantics can enjoy this movie, at least I did!"
"sineadmai97","10","2","5","19 June 2014"," There was no fault in that masterpiece!
","Shailene Woodley adopts the role of Hazel Grace Lancaster so beautifully that it is hard to believe this movie isn't based on a true story. The movie is very coming-of-age but also captures the true sadness of illness. It's great to see newcomers, such as Ansel Elgort who only rose to fame last year, and oldtimers, such as Willem Dafoe, come together for the adaptation of New York Times best seller book by John Green. The casting couldn't be more perfect and the soundtrack took my breath away (no hard feelings Hazel). But it has to be said, my experience of the film was more magical than i could have expected as i witnessed The Fault in Our Stars at an advanced screening two weeks before the actual release in the UK. The people lucky enough to go were given a limited edition poster and were able to watch a Q&A with the cast after the tears had been spilt and the credits rolled. The screening was so spectacular due to all the kids being hard core fangirls and fanboys (there was disapointingly, only one boy representing the males. We all awed, wooed, laughed and cried together and nobody was ashamed to let the whole theatre hear their sobs! It made the movie that much special. John Green is an excellent writer and the movie couldn't be any more representative of his book. 10/10. no questioning the matter :)"
"jimmy-r-nader","8","2","5","18 June 2014"," Bring back the romance.
","In the many dumb movies coming out, I felt that the Fault in our Stars brought back the romance to modern day teenagers. Romance we forgot as we grew older and got busy. I loved how the relationship evolved smoothly and grew little by little, making the spectator's hearts grow with them. You'll simply love the way they love each other.<br/><br/>Beautiful movie, intelligently written and I wished I haven't read the book before. If I didn't knew what was going to happen I would have cried more, but even though I cried. And generally I say books are better than adaptations, but in this case, I liked the movie way better. I even suggest to watch the film and then read the book, as a relief to revisit those attaching characters and depict beautiful quotes.<br/><br/>Have a nice cry."
"kenn-alcantara","7","2","5","18 June 2014"," I respect the book but this movie...... not so much
","When I first saw the trailer of this movie I already felt the hyped inside of me. Feeling that it will give me the A-walk-to-remember feeling all over again. I haven't read the book - YET - but seeing those positive feed backs of the trailer from the book lovers made me think that probably my excitement for this adaptation could be worth it. <br/><br/>Then June 07, 2014 happened. I could say that my sister and I picked the best seats inside the theater but as the opening credits and some scenes started showing I thought that maybe we didn't picked the best movie.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed in the opening scenes especially the opening credits putting a series of scenes from the movie. I mean, what is that?? are you trying to spoil what will happen before we can even watch it?! and what is the purpose of those opening scenes? For us to get excited before the movie? Well I surely lost my excitement after seeing those scenes.<br/><br/>Another ""turn off"" factor for this movie is the monologue of Shailene Woodley in the beginning. Surely a lot of people are raping that replay button once the trailer was released and they have probably memorized those lines, I myself memorized some of it after watching it two or three times. They could have at least alter some of the lines for the movie's opening after letting it be the opening of the trailer.<br/><br/>Enough of the movie's structures, I shall go now to its story line which gave the movie justice after that poor opening scenes followed by those cheesy-courting-twilight-cliché of the two characters in the beginning. And I am talking about the scenes from the Amsterdam. I think that it is where the story became mature and complex and I'm glad for it because I will surely leave the theater if it wasn't for that.<br/><br/>To sum this all up, the movie have pros and cons of course like any other movie. Besides the bad introduction, the actors also contributed to the movie's cons. I think Shailene is not ready for those kinds of roles, she can stick with her ""Divergent"" role first and let her potential evolve there. As for Ansel he lacks charisma and weak delivery of his lines, lines in which contributed to the movie's pros. Those lines are marvelous and for me I think it hasn't been done justice by the lead characters except Nat Wolff's delivery of his eulogy for Augustus, that almost made me cry.<br/><br/>I rate this movie 7/10 for the ""Amsterdam"" story of course"
"TheFilmGuy1","8","2","5","17 June 2014"," Surprisingly Really Good And Touching
","I know that since this movie is based on a book that is read by many teenage girls, the movie is bound to get people scoffing at it and writing it off, and I understand that. I myself expected to see some cheesy stuff that made me cringe at how hard it tries to be deep or sad. But I go into films wanting to enjoy them, and i'm not going to be an idiot and pretend like I didn't like this movie. I think a lot of people say it's bad just because lots of teenage girls like it and that means they need to bash it and shouldn't like it. It turned out to be really good, touching, and a lot less cheesy then I was expecting.<br/><br/>Let me say that I think Shailene Woodley does a great job. She sells the role completely and seems so sweet and likable. She takes lines from the book that might, when said out loud, seem cheesy or pretentious, but she makes them sound natural. I would say that I liked Ansel Elgort in his role 93% of the time. He doesn't always sell the lines, and sometimes it makes it seem cheesy or done just to make young teen girls swoon over him. He can occasionally fall into the ""dream guy"" cliché that romance films have, but I would say overall he works. You do care for him. They have great chemistry and it's so great seeing them on screen. I think they work quite well. <br/><br/>The sad parts are handled in a good manner. I won't spoil anything, but it doesn't feel like they're doing stuff to force us to cry at the movie. The movie just falls together well and you feel like crying because it works. It makes it all feel real. Their conversations feel fairly real (aside from a few remarks from Elgorts character such as the whole ""metaphor"" thing and the fear of ""oblivion). It really gets you right in the heart. <br/><br/>While it's not a perfect movie, it's extremely enjoyable and has a lot of heart. It will make you laugh, cry, and get you thinking about love. I will say that if you're and extremely negative single person, you might not like this movie. I think having an understanding of love or a relationship helps with connecting to the film. I saw it with my girlfriend and it really kind of made me think about our relationship, in a good way. If you're gonna hate on this for being marketed to teen girls, there's no point in watching it because you've already made up your mind about it. Otherwise, go and see this film. It's really something."
"Lightseven","6","2","5","17 June 2014"," Disney Version
","I loved the book. Let me say that again. I LOVED the book. The movie, though it had some charming moments and they did salvage a couple of good bits of dialog, felt as if someone went through the story with a big Disney-After School Special sponge and scrubbed away all the edges that made the book so unique.<br/><br/>Where was the snappy sass and witty repartee from Augustus when we meet him at the support group? In the book, his ease at teasing his soon to be blind friend was appalling and fantastic in equal measure and it set the tone for the reality of people living with cancer. They do not want pity and they wish, more than anything, that people wouldn't edit every freaking thing they say in their company because they will miss the good jokes when they do.<br/><br/>Where was the family gathering after Gus got out of the hospital and the cloying, sympathetic behavior of siblings and extended family that was so brilliantly exposed and demolished by Hazel & Gus's funny exchange in front of them all? <br/><br/>If they took the time to put thought bubbles over heads while texting, why didn't they just let Hazel narrate the deeper thoughts that easily could have been laced throughout the film? <br/><br/>And how the heck did the screenplay writer, the director and anyone else who read this miss the HUGE significance of the reading of kids names at the support group who had died? The singular moment they should have gone for a good cry from the audience should have been hearing Augustus's name echo out in that ""Heart of Jesus"" room and it would have been THE moment it all came together. But no. It either never got filmed or it's sitting on the cutting room floor. I could have done with less - way too long-dramatics when her parents got the call and the whole emotional bundle would have been offered at the name reading. <br/><br/>For any teens who saw this film and ""Loved it!"" 10 Stars! Hearts & Flowers! I encourage you to wait about ten, twenty, thirty years and read the book...again. You will, as an adult, finally understand the depth of what you have in your hands and when you re-watch this vanilla, cutesy teen love story film, you'll give it the six it deserves.<br/><br/>It could have been so much more if the screenwriters hadn't pulled their punches to dumb down the dialog for a larger audience. Really too bad. Oh, and the actors were great given the cold meatloaf they were handed to work with."
"laurenbrigittepool","10","2","5","16 June 2014"," What an amazing love story
","I have watched so many romantic movies such as The Notebook, Titanic etc. and this is definitely the best one I've ever seen. The story is brilliant and makes you want it to keep on going and going. Usually when I watch movies in cinemas I would occasionally check my phone to see what the time is or check up on what's going on social media. But with this movie, I never even touched my phone. I was just couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. And yes, it's a very sad story and I suggest that you do bring some tissues because if you cry during movies a lot, you're going to be heartbroken when watching this. It doesn't matter if your a male or female or an old or young person, you'll just love this movie and it's just so different from those other love stories... you know, how 90% of love stories made today: They meet, they like each other, they kiss, break up and then back together etc. The Fault in our Stars is just perfect. They love each other for the whole movie with no major fights. I recommend this to anyone, including the male population."
"sqz2","10","2","5","14 June 2014"," Simplistic fear and love
","I'm a man who hates teen love stories. While I do believe in love at first sight; I've been one who has been bitterly betrayed by ""love"". However when I first saw the previews for this movie I was intrigued by the nature of this love story. Romeo and Juliet is beloved because of what one will do for love. After seeing The Fault in Our Stars this story reminds me that it isn't just what one will do for love but how true love enhances and make precious the moments that you have before oblivion. The raw emotions of elation to despair draw you in. Unlike the perspective of The Bucket List of one who have lived life; this one reminds us how there are an infinite number of numbers between 0 and 1 and we are great indeed to have love even with the greatest pain. This movie hurts. Hazel and Gus will make you feel every nuance of joy, anticipation, eagerness, awkwardness,frustration, guilt, fear, frustration and peace. It sometimes takes death to remind us of living, and yes and that even one day no one will remember us."
"RoyaleWithBlood","6","2","5","9 June 2014"," Had a lot of fun, but didn't meet all my expectations.
","Before anyone get's mad at me, please note that not only am I a huge fan of the book, but also that a 6/10 is a positive score. I was really looking forward to this film, but a lot of things fell flat for me. Ansel Elgort is a really good actor, but I think that he wasn't the best choice for Augustus. A lot of the dialogue came off as unnatural, and it sounded really weird hearing it from him, (excluding his performance in the car scene). I loved Shailene Woodley as Hazel, and she really became the character, and I had no trouble believing that she was Hazel. I felt like the movie was actively trying to make you cry, rather than having the story and characters make you feel an emotion on it's own, and it felt cheap, and seeing all the people in the audience bawling honestly made me laugh. Josh Boone's directing felt very generic, and didn't really have a staple to it, which makes me sad, because this is a movie that could have a real staple feel to it. Overall, I was very disappointed with the movie, but believe me, I'm still looking forward to the Paper Towns movie"
"hassan_kulsoom","10","2","5","7 June 2014"," I'm glad I chose to get hurt by this movie
","*SOME SPOILERS*<br/><br/>This was definitely by far one of my favourite book to movie adaptations. I left the theatre feeling the same way I felt when I finished the book. Everything was so well done! I loved the acting, directing and writing of this movie! <br/><br/>I was skeptical when I found out the Ansel Elgort was going to play Augustus.. I had watched Carrie, and I loved the character he played in that movie, and I thought he was quiet cute.. I also watched Divergent, but personally, I don't like the character, so I didn't think much of his role in the movie. In the book, Augustus was described to be incredibly hot and breath takingly beautiful. Though I thought Ansel was good looking, I was still worried. However, I was not disappointed AT ALL by Ansel's portrayal and the director's choice. I could not have imagined a better person to play Augustus! He did such an amazing job playing the role! I fell in love with Augustus Waters all over again because of Ansel :) I knew that Shailene was going to do an amazing job! I have seen her previous movies/TV shows (The Descendants, The Spectacular Now, Divergent, The Secret Life of an American Teenager) and I already loved her as an actress! I was not at all shocked at her beautiful performance! Supporting cast did a remarkable job, glad to see Willem Dafoe in this movie! <br/><br/>The screenplay, locations and direction of this movie completely satisfied me as a book fan. Everything did complete justice to me as a fan. Though there were scenes that were taken out, I was no disappointed, though a little shocked. The way they portrayed the feelings and emotions of the book to the movie was SPECTACULARLY beautiful! The essence of the story and book was not missed! The same lessons were taught, the same emotions were felt and the same ache and tears came through half of the movie. The way the dealt with the tragedy was amazing.. I was so glad that they made us fall in love with Augustus the same way as John Green made us fall in love with him! The worst part for me to deal with was the pre funeral scene mostly, but mostly half of the movie left me in tears! <br/><br/>Excellent job done, and I could have not been happier as a book fan :) Thank you Josh Boone, Scott Neustadter, John Green, Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, Nat Wolff, and all other cast for making this experience the best possible for me!"

","You know how really good books are often adapted into crappy movies that don't do the story justice? The Fault in Our Stars is not one of them.<br/><br/>It's hard to describe the plot of TFIOS to convince someone to see it. I mean what else could you really say besides ""The Fault in Our Stars is a romance comedy about two teenagers with cancer who fall in love"" that doesn't make it seem like a typical sappy romance film that most of us are tired of by now? How else could we try to distinguish the unique quality of TFIOS as we know it besides following up on that plot summary with, ""But really, it's John Green. You just have to trust me on this!""?<br/><br/>I was honestly skeptical about seeing this movie at all. The cast didn't seem very exceptional from what I've seen from the trailers. I was afraid, like many others, that seeing the movie would replace my vision of the book as when you thinks Harry Potter, you instantly imagine Daniel Radcliffe. And I didn't trust the performances of the actors, especially having last seen Maleficent, in which all the cast were extremely bad with the exception of Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning.<br/><br/>It wasn't until I saw John Green's tweets about sneaking into the theater to see TFIOS with oblivious movie goers, learned about his close involvement with the movie adaption, and discovered that it was the official opening day that I got really excited and asked some friends to see the movie with me. I was skeptical throughout the entire movie until an involuntary teardrop ran down my face, and when it was difficult to stop myself from sobbing, I knew, this was extremely good. Shailene Woodley (Hazel) and Ansel Elgort (Augustus Waters) were absolutely phenomenal. Everything was extraordinary - the pacing, execution, cast, story content (what they included and didn't leave out from the book in the movie), music selection - not to mention hilarious. Well worth a watch. You'd be missing out if you didn't. I'm going to see TFIOS for a second time tomorrow because it's just that good.<br/><br/>I suggest reading the book first and then watching this. Make sure your heart can handle the tears. You'll be glad to be a part of Hazel and Gus's little infinity. <br/><br/>Okay?<br/><br/>Okay."
"Seraphion","8","2","6","12 June 2014"," This movie is heart-touching and relate not just to sick people.
","The story is about a cancer patient, Hazel, her condition requiring her to always carry a set of breathing equipment. At a support group, she meets Gus, a boy with a prosthetic leg after amputation from cancer. Their relationship grow, sharing a same passion in the novels, going together to Amsterdam to meet their favorite writer, and dealing with their illnesses together. Until the end, it turns out that Gus goes ahead of Hazel.<br/><br/>The base story was a so-so for me. A sick girl finds love in a fellow sick boy, going through hardships, until at the end one of them dies. This recipe is the essence of almost all of Indonesian drama in the 80s and 90s, that they bore me and made me have some low expectations on this movie. I don't even want to elaborate on the story like used to on my reviews because it's the same like the ones I mentioned.<br/><br/>But the development into screenplay and the execution is just great. The little things that often go undermined are the ones that in fact make this movie different. Yes this movie truly relate to other sick people and their suffering. But this movie also relate to the healthy population, but feeling a bit unstable in their minds, particularly on the later parts. The value being spread implicitly is that it's okay to not having so many people adoring or following us, as long as there is one that cares and loves us deeply.<br/><br/>The dialog is quite the strong part of this movie. There are more than a few remarks and punchlines that really touch the emotions and the hearts of the viewers. I personally am not a person to weep over any movie, but sometimes I get the chills when a movie is inspiring, and I admit, the dialog of this movie does give me the chills. I personally like the first and last monologues, they really touches the heart quite bluntly without being softened. Also the lines Gus tell Monica's mother is just a punch to any person's conscience.<br/><br/>The side scenes are also worthy of mention. The struggle of Isaac in coping with his breakup and the efforts of Gus and Hazel to cheer him up is a great addition to the main story. The twist and revelation of Van Houten's own struggle with the memories of his daughter is also touching.<br/><br/>The cast of up-and-coming actors are just a great recipe for this movie. It's the second time we see Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort in one frame after being brothers and sisters in Divergent a few months back. Well, I sure see Shaylene Woodley feeling quite at home with this genre of drama romance after last year's The Spectacular Now. For me this is the first I see Elgort in a focal role, and he doesn't disappoint. He plays the character Gus well and quite enliven the intended liveliness of the character. An addition of a senior Willem Dafoe playing the disgruntled and grumpy Van Houten completes the recipe without stealing the focus from the two main characters.<br/><br/>The acting is just quite as expected. I say just expected because quite frankly there isn't any highlights from the whole act. The movie is being great more from it's screenplay and story points. At least Woodley's acting is quite good because she is successful in transitioning from the quite fun drama in The Spectacular Now to this rather sad story. The soundtrack is greatly done placed. The selection is quite the safe ones for the taste of the common era's young adults. <br/><br/>Overall from me, it's a movie worth an 8 out 10 score and a recommendation to go and see. With such a heart-touching story and values relating not only to sick people, I think it deserves it."

My friend had seen it before and brought a roll of toilet paper instead of tissues because she had ran out from the previous time. <br/><br/>Needless to say I loved TFIOS. I loved the way that all the tears were real and how true to the book they stayed. A few small details were missing, but it was nothing that was drastic. <br/><br/>Shailene Woodley gave a phenomenal performance as Hazel. She was true to the character and didn't overdo it a single bit. <br/><br/>Ansel Elgort is a fresh face in Hollywood. I would call one of his first films a success. He did Augustus justice and never settled for anything less than perfect. <br/><br/>Nat Wolff was the comic relief of the whole movie. Every time he was on the screen he said something that made the audience just stop crying and laugh. A wonderful Isaac! <br/><br/>Wilem Dafoe's performance as Peter Van Houton was amazing. That was exactly how I pictured Van Houton and the way he just spoke was beautiful. <br/><br/>I give major creds to John Green. He was the wonderful voice behind all of this. Lines such as during Augustus' death scene were word for word and everything was so well done. <br/><br/>I laughed, I cried and I had to tell my friends I loved them just in case over fifty times.

From direct book quotes to the incredible acting and chemistry between Shai and Ansel, this movie had me crying from the sheer beauty of some parts and sobbing from the extremely well-portrayed sadness and despair that comes with cancer and suffering. Hazel's eulogy was directly from the book and brought me to tears, as did Isaac's speech and Gus's reactions. The scene with van Houten played out almost exactly like in the book, and Hazel's temper provided comic relief from the impending catastrophe at the end.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Shailene and Ansel was incredible. Being friends from shooting Divergent together, they could easily get along and communicate, and it was evident in the way that Ansel played Augustus that his character was deeply in love with Shailene's character Hazel. I felt like they were not actors, but the characters from one of my favorite books of all time brought to life on a 40-foot screen. The movie surpassed my expectations and left me speechless with tears brimming out of my eyes, and I absolutely loved it. If the scale went higher, it would get a 17 out of 10 from me."

","The Fault in Our Stars is a beautiful and thought provoking movie. The story centers on two young adults Hazel and Gus who without giving too much away have been battling cancer since they were little. The story is from Hazel's point of view. The movie is based off a best selling book. For fans of the book, well every fan is different but it was one of the most faithful and best book adaptations. In fact the movie actually ends better than the book. It gets the final lines just right. It may not be the ending I wanted after falling in love with the characters of Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace Lancaster. The movie is about life, love, friendship, family, humor,living with a cloud over your head and death. It has a lot of humor and a lot of heart. It is well written and acted.<br/><br/>Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort are perfectly cast as Hazel and Gus. Both give powerful performances. They are both amazing and gifted actors. Shailene and Ansel's on screen chemistry is natural, beautiful and phenomenal. They make Hazel and Gus not only one of the most memorable movie love stories in decades but two of the most likable and memorable characters to hit the screen.<br/><br/>Before this movie I was familiar with Shailene Woodley and knew she was talented so it was Ansel Elgort who really blew me away in this movie. Gus is such a remarkable character. You fall in love with him and his humor and his spirit. He is more relatable and memorable than Lloyd, Duckie, Landon, Noah,etc and Ansel brought Gus to live perfectly. His performance will make you laugh, and cry like a baby.<br/><br/>This movie is worth checking out more than once and is not just a movie for young adults.<br/><br/>It's one of the best love stories and movies in years."

It was a great movie with wit, character, a structured script, and comedy. Although I haven't cried in a movie since Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close back in 2011, I did cry while watching this tear jerker being played out by these amazing faultless stars.

"iwakura-21901","4","1","2","7 February 2019"," Shallowness with a halo
","I had very high hopes for this highly acclaimed film. After all, a mature theme (cancer), starring Shailene Woodley to boot (the girl from the Divergent series), what could go wrong, right?! This, to be precise: ""Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they meet and fall in love at a cancer support group."" Because, yeah, they're not falling in love, are they?! It starts with Gus 'accidentally' bumbing into the girl: he doesn't immediately pull back, but keeps pressed against her. That's your first clue: that isn't love, but teenage lust (and severely lacking in subtlety, at that). Then enter the session room; the boy can't take his eyes off of her, literally, and 'Mr. swooney' himself keeps glancing at her, all the time, even when she tries and break eye-contact. She doesn't seem to mind (from anyone uglier, his behavior would, for sure, have evoked a #metoo moment). Then they go outside, and the boy keeps up his act, heavily coming on to her again, pulling out all the charm stops.<br/><br/>At that point, I was already too disGUSted (pun intended) with the movie. Sure, Shailene Woodley is quite attractive (even with tubes up her nose), but this was not supposed to be flick about 'pretty girl meets handsome boy', was it? And yet, all the opening teenage lust ruins the premiss of the entire film for me, as it uses cancer as a disguise for what turns out to be just two attractive people instantly 'falling in love' (read: lust). And that undermines everything mature about this film, and only resoundingly underscores the shallowest message of all: a pretty boy meets a pretty girl -- despite their dismal circumstances masking it as something else. If the girl had been ugly -- or just mundane even -- and they'd still have fallen in love, that would at least have been something. As it was, though, it was just shallowness with a halo."

","This book touched many millions of teenage hearts around the world, so it's not surprising then that eventually Hollywood came calling wanting to adapt John Green's words to film.<br/><br/>And it's an honest attempt actually.

"TheBlueHairedLawyer","7","1","2","18 February 2017"," Great film to sit through, if the pretentiousness doesn't get you first.
","There are already hundreds of reviews for this film praising it as some beautiful and heartbreaking journey between two kids in love, and you know, those reviews are right. The Fault in Our Stars is absolutely incredible. If you want hours and hours of text going over how absolutely incredible it is, it's not too difficult to find the 10-star reviews. This is in my opinion a pretty good film with a lot to offer.<br/><br/>It's also incredibly pretentious. Its beginning introduction narrated by Hazel tells you that ""movies should tell the truth instead of romanticizing terminal illness"". And then it does exactly what it says movies shouldn't do, all while introducing two young adults who talk as though they're reciting poetry every time they open their mouths. If you really want the truth, people don't speak this way or act this way. Augusten was the most annoying character in a film I've ever come across in a long time. Every normal conversation between him and Hazel dissolves into geeky pop culture references, video games and philosophical musings. His pseudo-intellectual routine yet childish attitude just makes him seem ridiculous. Hazel herself is so apathetic that it's simply unrealistic. They have many wonderful on-screen moments together, but the pretentiousness got on my last nerve every time. The similar 2003 film 'My Life Without Me' (also about a girl dying from cancer and falling in love) did it the right way, showing real human beings without watering them down under nerd culture and lame jokes.<br/><br/>The great moments in this film however far outweigh the lousy ones. Issac, who has gone blind from retinal cancer, is perhaps the most realistic of any of the characters in the film. He bring initial comic relief to the story and later on profound sadness. Augusten does often drop the show-off attitude and prove himself to be an excellent person, whether taking Hazel on picnics to an enormous artists' rendering of a skeleton, to getting her on a tour to meet her favorite author in Amsterdam which strays from its route and ends up becoming a tour of Anne Frank's house. There's a lot of value to The Fault in Our Stars as a film in general, however the ending is very harrowing and this is not a story for everyone. It's going to be a magnificent masterpiece for some viewers, and a morose kick in the pants for others. Either way, whichever side of that spectrum you happen to fall on, this is still a story worth pursuing."
"kristinator1","4","1","2","20 February 2016"," Disappointing if you've read the book
","Despite it being a cute movie, whenever I read a book first, the movie falls short. In the book, Augustus is a charming and seriously witty guy....and his relationship with Isaac is hilarious. The movie leaves out some of the most clever lines and replaces it with...nothing. It's not a terrible movie, but I think the script was a little flat and missed the essence of the characters described in the book. I feel like they just blew through the entire movie too quickly, like they were trying to cram it all in. If there was too much in the novel to make a movie, they should have picked some of the key scenes and developed the story around that rather than barely scratch the surface. The book gave so much to work with. I'm disappointed, to say the least."

","""The Fault In Our Star"" is the romance movie. This movie talked about two teenage cancer patients that fall in love with each other. A girl, Hazel Graze has lung cancer and a boy, Augustus Waters lost one leg with cancer. They met at a Cancer Support group and knew each other and their health problems. In the final part is so sad as the author of this movie ""John Green"" put Augustus Waters dead. Hazel Grace is my favorite character because she's strong and brave even she has lung cancer since she was young but she never given up. I really feel real to her. My favorite part of this book is when Augustus confessed his love to Hazel Grace, which I felt so happy for them. The sad scene is on the final part, Hazel Grace reads the letter that Augustus wrote for her after he died. This book made me cry so hard and it never keep me from turning the pages. I really wish the final part won't end like this that I hope Augustus Waters is alive and have happy ending with Hazel Graze. I would like to recommend this book for everyone especially for people whom like book with relationship and dramatic."

I was curious as to why this movie is so good and at the same time makes you cry. I don't regret watching it at all. It is very satisfying movie, that will bring you to tears. Every time I watch it, it does really touch my heart. It shows you the meaning of life. The movie is hilarious, beautiful and heartbreaking all at the same time. The casting is great, the acting is great and it feels real. The acting was brilliant and made the whole film work. Each character was likable and had arcs. The effects are great as well. It is one of my favorite movies of all time. I've read and watched the movie many times but I still won't get bored. I have to give most of the credit to John Green for writing an amazing book. I highly recommend this movie to everyone especially teens. See it! Don't miss it! Or you will regret that you missed best movie of all time!"
"Cathex","2","1","2","12 October 2015"," Whose Fault is This Film?
","The fault in not in the stars, but in the minds of this films creators.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Josh Boone. Despite being pictured on IMDb with a Bob Dylan T-shirt, his films are usually the equivalent of teeny bopper pop songs, all sparkle and no soul. He also uses the same formula for every single film. It's his little bag of (cheap) tricks which is as follows - <br/><br/>1.Make sure your love story has a bit of death in it so that love becomes more important.<br/><br/>2. Keep everything very superficial in terms of thoughts and feelings and instead just use clichés to achieve empathy.<br/><br/>3.Throw in as much of your own musical taste as possible because everyone should have to listen to your ipod when they watch your film.<br/><br/>4. Set you pretentious melodrama in white middle class America, making sure everyone is rich and good looking, cos no-one wants to watch ugly poor people crying, that's just awkward. <br/><br/>And hey presto, you've got a Josh Boone film. <br/><br/>But I wanted so much to have something good to say about a movie that sets out to empathise with people who are terminally ill, but instead I found myself actually angered by this films approach to such a serious issue. <br/><br/>Despite being diagnosed with cancer, both of the main characters seem totally fine, very happy and to be honest in complete denial. I'm not saying this kind of movie should be a total downer, but nor should it be a disneyfied dose of shallow distraction.<br/><br/>If that is the case however then we are left with a question of some moral implication, namely, does this movie make light of the kind of suffering and depression involved in diseases like cancer, or is it simply trying to provide some light distraction? My view, was the former. <br/><br/>Even as a film for teenagers a blanket whitewash of teeny charm, axiomatic platitudes and pseudo-morality is hardly a responsible framework of material for a film that supposedly aims to help, lacking as it does in any sense of emotional maturity or intellectual depth.<br/><br/>I am glad however that they donated a large portion of money to cancer charities. For that, this film is forgiven. But honestly, show a Boone movie to a struggling poverty-stricken member of any society, who actually has real problems, and you'll have a riot on your hands. <br/><br/>If you want a serving of insincere and self indulgent sympathy then this film does the trick."

","This is my first film review here. Actually I will not review much but just share my feelings and observations and the film very shortly.<br/><br/>1. The theme is poor; a very cliché subject to work on. 2 The script is very poor; many meaningless conversations. 3. Casting is poor; characters do not match at all. 4. Acting is extremely poor; You never get into the film as you cannot get rid of the feeling that they are only ""acting"". Especially Augustus and Hazel's mother (and up to a point her father) were very far away from being real. Also the mimics and the toning of the conversations were ridiculous.<br/><br/>I think high rating of this film come from teenagers which may be the target of this film.<br/><br/>I gave a 6 to this film but I am too much generous, I should say.."
"simaoguedes-1415926","4","1","2","10 September 2015"," Well... Not so good...
","This was really not a very good movie — but I cannot say it was a very bad one either. It did show some interesting things, but it was still perhaps not worth it.<br/><br/>Let me start with the good things. To begin with, it really is kind of an interesting love story. This is rather notable and, I must admit, it leaves me wanting (because I am a 16-year-old who has never had a girlfriend).<br/><br/>I appreciated some of the things said. For example, near the end, Hazel's speech regarding infinity does provide some matter for thought. Augustus's metaphor regarding the cigarette was notably interesting as well. Thus, I cannot say I left the cinema the same I entered.<br/><br/>Now, for the bad things. The whole idea of this love story is kind of cliché. That is one thing. They meet in an unusual way, she thinks he's a jerk, but then, somehow (I'd like to know how!) she likes him, and so on.<br/><br/>By the way, what were the guys' parents thinking about when they chose their names? Hazel and Augustus? Really?<br/><br/>And then, of course, we could not have a good movie without having someone dying at the end!<br/><br/>Furthermore, of course, this film contains a few swear words, which, for me, always decrease a film's quality. It also encourages premarital sex.<br/><br/>In all, it has a few interesting stuff (I'm not telling you not to watch it), but it has quite some bad things as well. You can watch it if you want but, if you're like me, do not expect much."

","I had no expectations towards this film, based on the reviews I thought it's the kind of movie you have already seen without actually seeing it. However, falling in love is so beautifully depicted in this movie that I'm not sure I have seen anything like this in recent films. The two main characters (and the actors) are absolutely lovable just for what they are, for their silly jokes and meaningful thoughts. Some scenes are so powerful that you'd want to be in their place despite the cancer/dying background. It certainly had an impact on me, at least. And I was once again persuaded how great actor Willam Dafoe is, and it was also nice to see Lotte Verbeek from Nothing Personal"
"robertrwilhelm","4","1","2","15 June 2015"," The overly tear-filled final 30 minutes ruined it for me. Sorry.
","Many will likely disagree with my rating of ""The Fault In Our Stars"", and I am understanding of that. This movie was recommended to me by almost everyone I know that had seen it in its opening weeks. I was told that people ""couldn't stop crying"" and that it was ""the saddest movie I've ever seen"". Now to be clear, I'm sympathetic of those suffering from cancer and their families and friends. I myself have had several relatives diagnosed with various types of cancer. I also understand that being told someone very close to you is dying is a very difficult and sad situation. Again, I've been in such a situation myself. But despite my sympathy I cannot give this movie a good rating because of its layout. I saw it as a nice romantic movie deserving of a 6/10 rating through roughly the first 1:25:00. But then there is a moment in the movie where Gus informs Hazel of his condition, being diagnosed with incurable cancer throughout his body. This scene signals the beginning of a 30 minute sob-fest for the rest of the film. I personally don't enjoy watching people cry for about half-an-hour. The drawn out ending ruined it for me and dropped the grade two points resulting in a 4/10."

So I finally got around to watching this off HBO GO awhile back. <br/><br/>Woodley, who really impressed me with her performance, stars as a teen cancer patient who meets Elgort in a cancer support group. They use the ""grant a wish"" program to get her to Europe to meet the author (Willem Dafoe) of a book she is obsessed with, and he doesn't meet up to her expectations. Oh, such is life. <br/><br/>Now I liked this movie, don't get me wrong, but I am only giving it a marginal recommendation due to how forced it seemed at times. In fact, I really just found the stuff with the author to be kinda forced. Willem Dafoe- great actor- don't get me wrong, but I thought the story of the two teen cancer patients was really enough to fuel this movie along, and didn't really think it was necessary. Yes- I know- based on a book; but that's just the direction I would've went with. Rising star, Nat Wolff, also stars as their friend who has his own set of physical issues to deal with."

","Adaptation of the bestselling book of the same name about a terminally ill 17-year-old who falls in love with a cancer survivor that she meets at a support group. All cast is very likable, with admiral performances by leads Woodley and Elgort, and an exceptional supporting appearance by Dafoe. A real plus for not spoonfeeding the audience; but for a story that insists on being honestly sad, it certainly lines itself up for convenient tragedy with a turn-of-events that is quite predictable to the more observant viewer.

"meeza","9","1","2","11 March 2015"," Not faulty at all!
","There are not too many faults in the emotional ""The Fault in Our Stars"". The movie is centered around Hazel and Augustus, two teenagers with cancer who form an exceptional friendship and romance. It is based on John Green's best-selling book which made plenty of green in the literary world. The ascending Shailene Woodley marvels again with another solid performance, here as Hazel; Shailene fortunately has not diverted herself into the poisons of Hollywood demise. Newcomer Anton Elgort is an unfaulty star-in-the-making with his work here as Augustus. And I also thought Willem Dafoe was stellar as novelist Van Houten; but a Dafoe performance is usually outstanding just at default. Josh Boone's direction of the film was authentic as he did not convert ""The Fault in Our Stars"" into a weepy Lifetime movie by incorporating a myriad of themes in the picture. I loved how love for a novel became a potent point in the movie; yes, I even read into that. Sure, this type of film will bring the handkerchiefs and kleenexes out, but I refuse to call ""The Fault in Our Stars"" a tearjerker. I rather describe it as a strong movie about the power of love; and maybe I am reaching for the stars, but last I checked, there is no fault in that. ***** Excellent"

"diaz3","9","1","2","24 February 2015"," The Fault in Our Stars: What's The Buzz All About?
","The movie, The Fault in Our Stars, was originally based of the novel by John Green. This comedic drama is an excellent and accurate portrayal of the novel. Production elements that are included enhance the overall movie and add depth to the plot and characters. The protagonist, Hazel Grace, played by Shailene Woodley, takes part in many voice-over scenes. She reflects on the events going on in her life, therefore cueing in the viewer to the emotional side of her brain. This voice-over technique is beneficial because it gives her character an introspective trait. In a dramatic movie, introspective characters are essential to allowing the audience to feel the ways the characters do, as a narrator would do for the reader of a novel.<br/><br/>The actors chosen for this movie did an exceptional job of capturing the emotion felt in each scene. Some scenes between Hazel and Gus, played by Ansel Elgort, were playful and filled with the youth and innocence a teenager carries while others were saddening and haunted by the gloom of nearing death. Both of these strong, yet opposite emotions were carried out in many of the scenes. The movie provides a good, clear message to people who are going through a tough time like the main characters. The characters both find something to look forward to in their lives that seemed to be flooded by negativity. This idea is significant to the movie and also significant to people experiencing similar feelings.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, this movie captures two teenagers trying to live a positive life after being effected by cancer. The on screen chemistry between Gus and Hazel is impeccable and the loss of Gus brings instant tears to your eyes. This young love is a great one and the characters chosen for the roles portrayed the characters in the book accurately. Their chemistry together proved to get them through the worst of situations and undeniably sad ending never ended their love for one another.<br/><br/>Speaking of good acting, Hazel grace truly captures the anger of a teenager who has loss respect for a role model. When she meets Peter Van Houten, played by Willem Dafoe, she finds out he is a drunk. He is openly rude to them and blatantly offensive towards their sicknesses. The scene is very powerful with lots of emotion and frustration. Hazel perfectly reflected the part of a flustered teenager trying to express anger, while Gus tried to bring her back to earth and turn the situation into a position one. Later, the movie reveals Peter Van Houten's anger stems from him losing his daughter to cancer when she was a young age. Still, his actions were unacceptable and Hazel's anger was justifiable. The emotional aspect of the movie added new depth to plot line.<br/><br/>On a separate note, the soundtrack was fitting for the movie and some of the songs took off and hit the top charts. The music for movies is important because it sets the mood for the upcoming scenes. In this case, each of the songs expressed either positive or negative emotion. At the peaks of the movie, for example, their trip to Amsterdam, the song is very upbeat and provokes positive energy, which reflects what the characters are all feeling. The use of music enhanced the movie greatly.<br/><br/>Out of all the elements that were used in this movie to make it a great and memorable one, there is one aspect they didn't really touch on. Both Hazel and Gus had cancer and were going through treatments. The movie failed to go in-depth about the medical side of this story and touch upon what was entailed by each of their cancers. To make this movie more relatable and down-to earth the producers could have added facts and information about thyroid cancer, which Hazel had, and the cancer that Gus had. There were several other characters involved, for example Gus' friend or the other kids in the support group, who also had cancer that could have been further explained.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9.2/10"
"asmccarter96","10","1","2","22 February 2015"," Hazel and Gus are two teenagers with cancer who try to pursue their dreams and wishes together, even when their bodies don't seem strong enough.
","The Fault in Our Stars was released one June 6, 2014 and is based on John Green's bestselling novel that was published in January 2012. Shailene Woodley plays Hazel Grace Lancaster and is paired on screen with Ansel Elgort, who plays Augustus ""Gus"" Waters, to form a couple of star- crossed lovers. The choice in actors to play the roles in this movie is what brings the love story alive. Woodley portrays Hazel with what seems like an effortless grace. Hazel is a teenager who is facing death, therefore she is reserved and does not possess an over the top attitude. Woodley depicts this to her viewers with ease. She appears on screen with minimal makeup, close-cut hair, and a low key wardrobe. Woodley stays away from overly dramatic tactics and ""rarely oversells her character's goodness and witand manages to convincingly convey terminal illness without invoking easy pathos"" (Barker). Being able to not overly sell the cancer side of the story is vital to the success of her role. It would have been easy for Woodley to rely solely on the sympathy from the viewer for the cancer but she strives to make the viewer feel for Hazel as a person and the relationships that she has, not for the battle she faces. Woodley never gives the impression that she is striving for the audience's approval, just as Hazel never strives for anyone's approval, which causes the audience to feel for her character even more. Though Elgort and Woodley form a seamless bond on screen, he does not quit match Woodley's naturalism with her character. At first glance Elgort's "" cocky, smirking self-confidence"" (Barker) never quite meshes with Gus but Elgort is charming enough to cause the viewer to look past this. Gus is described in the New York Times as a ""perfect romantic hero"" (Scott). Gus is a boy who wears his heart on his sleeve and keeps an upbeat attitude, despite his situation. Elgort constantly has a goofy smile, is full of chivalry, and has a mischievous modesty about himself. All of these characteristics are what make the viewer fall for him fall far him, even before Hazel does. Elgort shows Gus's quirkiness to his viewers and that makes him adorable in their eyes. This bond between Elgort and the viewer is what sells Gus on screen. Elgort uses his own light hearted attitude and sense of humor to bring these attributes of his character to life on the screen. The two actors not only star in this movie together but are costars in the movie Divergent. The two became very comfortable with each other on the set of Divergent. Elgort reported that ""Hazel and Gus are best friends and that's their relationshipit's a really really close friendship and me and Shailene have that, and to have that to build on is so helpful"" (Kirby). The two having already become so close on an emotional level is evident on the big screen. This relationship is what allows the two to bring the relationship between Hazel and Gus alive. Director Josh Boone states that he ""trusts his actors to carry their own dramatic weight"" (Barker). Woodley and Elgort did just that. Being emotionally attached to the other person off camera allows their emotions that are presented on screen to be raw and moving. Though the story of Hazel and Gus is a heartbreaking love story, it is one that is simply irresistible. The Fault in Our Stars is rumored to be seen as this generations love story. It compared to the film Love Story, which also tells the tale of a tragic romance that is tainted with cancer. Hazel appears ""to become more beautiful as death ostensibly approaches"" (Slotek) just as the main character did in Love Story. Her beauty growing as tragedy approaches is due to her interaction with the other characters. Woodley portrays Hazel with elegance even when she is watching the love of her life wither away, whether it be away in a gas station parking lot or when she speaks from her heart at his ""prefuneral"". It is because Elgort allows Gus's love and goofiness to come through that it seems okay for him to pass away. Haze tries stay strong and hold back her hurt but it is still evident, which is contribution to her growing beauty. She is strong on the outside for the one she loves but is dying on the inside, literally and figuratively. Her pain is beauty. We see the emotion erupt from Hazel when in Amsterdam and many other scenes throughout the movie. These scenes are full of raw emotion but Woodley presents them so well we are not distracted by poor acting, but allowed to see the naturalism flow and depict the true beauty of Hazel. Though they are doomed from the beginning they still manage to find their always. The actors allow their viewers to see the two teenagers fully embrace the meaning of living instead of just being alive as they fight to pursue their dreams and wishes, despite their circumstances. Choosing these two actors are a key part of the movies success."

","First of all, I would like to say I was completely torn by this movie from the perspective of this young boy who is desperate but so singular and unique, and this beautiful young girl, also somewhat desperate, who thinks her insecurities and cancer make up the reason she had no friends. The movie completely did its job overall, and split me in two when one was pulled away from the other in agony. I would've and didn't expect anything less than what I got, a beautiful, meaningful, very- believable movie with one of my favorite actresses and actors. If you are sitting at home reading this, there is no reason you shouldn't watch this movie. It changed my outlook on love stories forever.<br/><br/>Amazing book and movie, and I think the actresses and actors used to portray the character couldn't have been better picked. Absolutely stunning lines to rip your heart out, and an amazing story.<br/><br/>This movie was amazing and awful and happy and terrible in the perfect ways. 9 1/2 out of 10.

It's one of the best movies i've even watched, it made laugh and cry, it just simply made me happy. And it's really amazing. I've given almost half the movies i've watched 10/10, but this is the one that truly deserves it. And if i could give this movie a 100 i would, i got so obsessed over it. If you want to watch a romantic movie that'll just make you smile and cry, i really suggest this. It's not like all the cancer love stories or whatever. It's just kind of different, people might say that i'm over rating it, but i sure am not. Everybody has a different taste in movies. But if you like romance, you'll love this movie, i hope."

As i expected the movie would be, it was worth my expectations. Though some facts are skipped in the movie, the movie is incredibly awesome and the part played by the Shailene Woodley as the Hazel Grace is perfect including her voice. It reminds me the quotes in the book. Indeed, John Green's writing is adorable that contain much of interesting and funny quotes. I was much eager to watch it, and now i am curious to read its story again and to remember its quotes. As i finished watching it, i jumped into IMDb to write a review about it.

Obviously I'm talking about those who haven't watched this movie because if you have you might not need to read reviews about it because i expect you have a very crisp idea of this movie so to those who haven't watched the movie, here is my review.<br/><br/>At first i thought to myself, like i would when I'm watching Romantic movies , ""Oh this is going to be one of those girl meets perfect boy movies...but truth be told its very different. From the way the couple use humour and a slice of wit here and there really lays a good foundation for the movie unlike any cliché Romantic movies I've watched in a long time, It's a story of self imperfections and how love is able to bring even the greatest imperfections together in one passionate tale of two lovers. The movie is one of kind being that it is one of the first Romantic movies to ever make me cry, and i'm sure it will make you cry as well. Last of all the main reason why i would highly recommend this movie is the simplicity and the way the whole storyline and events are not forced but are neatly layered in order to make a well written movie that does not disappoint. The Fault In Our Stars is definitely one movie that is worth watching and along the way you will learn a lot of things about love."

If you can predict the end it means that you were listening and watching every detail. <br/><br/>Actors were playing amazing. I believed every moment, every step. Actually I am that kind of person who doesn't cry. Especially when someone is next to me. But this time... I couldn't hold myself anymore. For a moment my eyes turned into a waterfall.

","This is better than A Walk to Remember, not that they should even be compared. I was opposed to the concept of the novel, and waited until long after my friends raved about it to read it. Then I did. I absorbed it in one night. I say absorbed because this story is not one that empties you, takes your tears and leaves you devoid of emotion. This story fills empty places that you didn't know you had. It reaffirms that life is precious and shot. Love is pure, timeless, knows no boundaries. All of the complications we make our lives have are not necessary-- we should all look at the world like Augustus Waters, size what we want, and love it with everything we have."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","5","1","2","24 January 2015"," Painfully smug.
","Now when a film tells you it's more honest than other films you can tell it's full of crap. Just because it has a morbid premise doesn't make it anymore real than the rest of the teenage melodrama. The Fault In Our Stars is painfully smug as it relishes in its idiotic quirks. Each one deserves a ferocious eye roll. Its Manic Pixie Dream Boy Ansel Elgort encapsulates everything wrong with its smarminess, contrivances and pretence. Thank god the film got bored of him by the second half. And we're trapped with these two characters, only offering us a Laura Dern or Willem Dafoe to look at occasionally. I quite like its fantasies and it has a few decent moments where actual obstacles confront the characters without the film opting for easy solutions. But they're swiftly ruined by baffling decisions such as having an audience clap for their kiss in Anne Frank's house. When it isn't schmaltzy, the film revels in its trivialities and indiscernible philosophies. Shailene Woodley's conviction of the trite material is decent, but the film has such an ugly production that there's little to redeem it above mediocrity.<br/><br/>5/10"
"omarzm","10","1","2","20 January 2015"," The Fault of Our Starts story and characters review. Some spoilers are included though.
","The Fault in Out Starts. What a movie!! The way the characters portrayed their roles made me feel like i am in their places facing the same dilemma they are.SPOILER AHDEAD. One thing that made me in love with this movie is how Hazel knew that one day she would eventually die,probably young, but still she embraced here destiny and was living her life almost normally. It was also one of the very few movies that made my tears go down. One of the most sad moment is when they were sitting on the bench and Gus told Hazel about his new cancer and she just said ""so unfair."" Understanding the title itself will make you sad. It explains that what happened to these young lovers was not of there own doing, but was that of their fate and destiny. Hazel wanted to ""limit the casualties"" but avoiding being loved by people and thus making them escape the suffering of getting they hearts broken when she dies. But this suffering and pain were getting closer an bigger to Hazel herself upon hearing Gus new diagnoses. The eulogy that hazel wrote for Gus was sentimentally devastating for me, one of the saddest scenes in both the movie and the book. Hazel was expecting yet very scared of the moment when she hears the news about Gus's death. But these expectations were not enough to hold here tears though. As she saw her parents coming up to her roam in the night, she fell to tears. The way Hazel parents dealt with here condition was also fascinating. They weren't always crying and sad,at least not in front of hazel. The character of Gus symbolizes a hell lot of things, living life as if it is the last day, embracing your destiny no matter what it is, living the 'now' and not caring about 'later'. Gus changed the life of Hazel forever, in his life and death. He showed Hazel that she is not alone in her fight, that he will always be there for here. He taught here the meaning of love and,unfortunately, the meaning of losing someone you love. Through the character of Isaac, the author showed how people change from around sick people, the act as if they want you but finally cannot take it anymore, which is funny because your the one suffering here. The Fault in Our Starts. A book about too young lovers who met at a cancer support group and fell in love. Their destiny however held much pain coming for the two lovers in the journey through their limited days of life that they had left. I hope people would know that real people, not just in novels, face these problems and sad luck. Parents loosing their children, a husband loosing his wife,........ Be thankful for what you are and who you are. be thankful that there is no FAULT IN YOUR STARTS. be thankful for your health, and live every day of your life as if it is the last, because some where, someone unfortunate is wishing that he had a bigger INFINITY like yours than what INFINITY he has."
"jeffreygwilliams","8","1","2","17 January 2015"," Out of the demographic of the movie, grading on a curve
","I am completely out the demographic of this movie but I ended up watching this.<br/><br/>This is obviously a tearjerker meant for primarily teenage girls, so adjust accordingly.<br/><br/>But I will say this movie has a really good heart and solid message. It's refreshing to see a female teen character who attracts a guy through her smarts and wits. It's also refreshing seeing a male character who isn't all horned up and actually believes in courtship and respect. <br/><br/>A special shout out to Shailene_Woodley, who has an amazing and convincing performance. <br/><br/>If you are parent of teenagers, I this would be a mostly positive movie for kids to watch. There is just old-fashion courting that you never see in teen sex comedies. It almost has a religious feel and overtones but avoids that path. This will certainly be a 'classic' movie in a young adult genre."
"Rickting","8","1","2","17 January 2015"," Not the clichéd weepie you're expecting
","The Fault In Our Stars wants to make you cry. And it succeeds with a vengeance. It'll boost Kleenex sales for sure. near guaranteed to have everyone in the theatre sobbing, TFIOS is a devastating tear jerker of a movie. Grown men, you'll cry as well. A love story between 2 cancer patients played by Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, this is based on a popular book which I haven't read but would now like to. I usually avoid this kind of thing since many romantic films (Endless Love I'm looking at you) are nothing more than 2 dimensional formula sheets which aren't even remotely touching, but TFIOS is a relatively rare exception. It's not a perfect movie and is admittedly supported by a somewhat clichéd framework. Ansel Elgort's character is a bit unrealistic and very occasionally they seem to be sugarcoating the story. Also, the first kiss happening in the Anne Frank museum seemed questionable. The film believes it's subverting romantic clichés even though in many ways it isn't and this is slightly off putting.<br/><br/>Mostly, however, this is not your typical weepie. The film is surprisingly humorous and although the key emotional moments hit hard, there is a sense of hope and lightness to the story as well. The screenplay has clearly been written with skill, and the lovers at the centre of the story, both played excellently, have very strong chemistry throughout. The visuals and direction further enhance the film and although it does go into a truly heart-breaking third act, the journey there is one of hope and celebration, managing to find a balance of happier and sadder elements. This is likely the best love story of 2014, and its target audience will love it. It's not as smart as it thinks it is, but the effectiveness of its emotions and screenplay are unexpected and borderline gut wrenching. Deservedly a very successful film, this is a love story which can appeal to those who aren't a fan of this kind of thing. Just bring the tissues.<br/><br/>8/10"
"tinker-bell_14","10","1","2","25 November 2014"," The Fault in Our Stars
","The Fault in Our Stars is a romance and drama movie based on the novel of John Green. This movie was release on June, 6 2014 and has been directed by Josh Boone (Stuck in love, 2013). The principal actors in The Fault in Our Stars are Shailene Woodley (Divergent) who played Hazel Grace Lancaster and Ansel Elgort (Divergent, Carrie) who played Augustus ""Gus"" Waters. The acting of this two was amazing. The chemistry between Shailene and Ansel was unbelievable, they transmitted us so many emotion in a short time and they represented the character of the book very well. The transmission of their chemistry in their character make the story looks very real, serious and sincere. I read the book before watching the movie and the story is almost the same. All the important elements and details of the book are there and also more. For all the readers, we could not ask better. Even if the characters are sick, we can associate themselves to this characters and it makes the movie very sensitive and moving. I think that the best quotes of the movie and the most moving is ""You gave me a forever within the numbered days""-Hazel Grace Lancaster. It's one of the best movies that I ever seen and I encouraging people to see it because it's make people think about real life and all which surrounds it."

Akin to Tom Hank's performance in Forrest Gump! Ansel Elgort's performance is equally Spectacular! Nat Wolff's performance was Great too! Shailene's performance was what draws people into the movie. She becomes and ultimately IS Hazel Grace! With a few True Stars you can see it in their expressions and mostly see it in their eyes. Rowan Blanchard's performances as Riley in Girl Meets World is similar. Shailene is a star that has not reached her full potential!

The director did an excellent job with each scene, each contrast that made me want to watch it just a little more with each passing minute. As Gus hoped, I hoped; as Hazel hoped and dreamed, and cried, so did I. In many ways, it was an exploration of all our selves; insecurities and death, literally and figuratively. What made it incredibly relatable was the age range of these actors through which the story was portrayed; were it an older cast, it would not have been as impactful."

The movie stuck to the book the way any adaption should, and the actors were perfect for the parts they were chosen to play. One of the few movies adapted from a book that I have thoroughly enjoyed just as much as when I read the book itself, as it wasn't butchered when made into a film as many book to film adaptions are.

","The film has gained a lot of popularity among the young audiences. The reason is obvious, the agony of young star crossed lovers depicted through few emotional sequences. To be fair, the film doesn't create the flair of a nice melodrama. Perhaps due to lack of a better script, the characters somewhat don't appear sympathetic which they ought to be. However in certain instances, the film does work; and particularly, the performance of heroine overshadows the hero's role, which unfortunately doesn't look very natural. Nowhere the signs of disability or the affliction appears in the hero's character. The biggest flaw in the script of the film was its failure to depict the dreadfulness of the cancer they are ongoing which makes the film appear not more than a feel good time passer. The affliction of the disease and their scorn or desire with life doesn't just come in this teenage romance. Only the sequence shot in Anne Frank's museum catches the agony of the protagonist.<br/><br/>Rating: 1.5 stars out of 4"

Yes I know this is a work of fiction, but there are real people out there dealing with the diseases these characters have to deal with.<br/><br/>Shailene Woodley does a very good job as the main character and I for one believe she will continue to get better as she grows older.

Audiences may have expected, Shailene Woodley to deliver one of her best performance yet but Ansel Elgort, the guy who portrays Augustus Waters brings such warmth and vulnerability to his character that one might be unable to help themselves but wish to have a friend just like Gus. So for those who love romantic dramedy with a twist, this is definitely the movie for you."

","This was by far one of my most favorite movies. I haven't heard anyone say that they didn't like it yet. The story line is amazing and so are the actors. It's a movie I can't forget... Not to mention I did shed a few tears here and there but that's how great it was. There was so much chemistry in the movie, it was so romantic. I even learned a few things in the movie. But I expressed many emotions while watching this movie. I recommended it to some of my friends and they really want to see it now and I wouldn't mind going back with them to watch it too. I want to thank John Green for not only making a great book but also a great movie.It's a great movie to see with friends, family, or if you're in a relationship and want to see a movie together."
"sesht","Null","1","2","4 July 2014"," What did you expect with that title?
","What could've been a maudlin, mushy exercise in wishy-washy-weepy fare turns out to be thoroughly entertaining, engrossing and emotionally fulfilling. <br/><br/>Aided in no small measure by the tight screenplay and the source work, the key lead performances and their collective as well as individual predicaments hold mainstay throughout, without even treading into sentimental territory. Sure, there are tears shed, but nothing that wouldn't be happening in scenarios such as this one out in the real world. Shailene Woodley, after her 'spectacularly divergent' turns in the recent past, owns this along with her non-Divergent brother who plays the lead here opposite her - Ansel Elgort. Cocky to the point of being annoyingly arrogant, he dials that stuff down just enough for us to care for the fate of the protagonists.<br/><br/>Even though a couple of themes explored here seem far-fetched, the characterization never allows us to wallow in despair, and the various instances during which emotionally distressing events are handled with flair and humor make everyone tide over the difficulty of handling near-death situations while interacting/living with palliative care-worthy patients.<br/><br/>The score keeps things lively, and along with '500 days of summer', will make a good addition for collectors. <br/><br/>Laura Dern and Sam Merlott provide adequate support with the limited material they're handed, but Willem Dafoe still proves that he will always be a scene-stealer, no matter the grotesquerie he inhabits in front of the camera, chewing up everything else with each word he utters. <br/><br/>I generally look for originality whenever I try to watch a movie, but watching this one, though every beat is predictable and by-the-numbers, it made me appreciate what a well-written screenplay could bring to the table and make something worth enjoying, appreciating the finer nuances of each aspect of film-making. Sure, its not 'As good as it gets' (in more ways than one), but for now, it will do."

","For everyone who has waited for this in a long time: It would be amazing to finally see a movie turn out to be so much like the book. They use the little quotes, the big lines everything. Okay not every detail can be in it but we must forgive that. Look at other movies which don't even come close to the book. No this Movie is a good one. It is obvious that John Green was at the set and helped out if it wasn't going the way the book was going.<br/><br/>However compared to all the emotion in the book, I must admit that in the movie it was barely. Of course I cried, I'm a girl come on. However I didn't really cry because of what happened on the screen but more because I thought how that felt when I read it in the book. I think that they could have done a much better job with the emotions. There were a lot of people crying in the cinema, so I doubt if they agree with me but I found it all with all a bit emotionless for the person who watched it. It was for example just Hazel crying. To me it was nothing more. <br/><br/>Still I have to give one compliment for the way they use text messages. Absolutely brilliant. I'm just a bit disappointed because I thought it would be a real tear- jerker but it wasn't."
"kikigalbreath","7","1","2","9 June 2014"," Really Good Movie, but Missing Some Things...
","I've been really excited to see this movie, especially since I read the book before hand and absolutely loved it. However, I saw the movie this morning, and it surprised me a bit. While it was a good movie, and I loved Augustus Waters' portrayal by Ansel Elgort, I felt it was just missing something. Maybe for me, it wasn't as good as I expected it because I loved how the book focused on both the love story between Hazel and Augustus, and the time when Augustus was dying and died. I honestly feel that Hollywood wanted to portray the love story as the main focus (which is is even in the book,) but washed over the cancer part a bit more than they expected to. Another thing that concerned me was that I didn't cry. Now, I am a very emotional person, but I guess that me not crying was a combination of me already knowing what was in store, and the fact that the funeral scene wasn't very convincing to me. When I read the book, I literally cried myself to sleep when reading about Augustus' death and his funeral. I felt that in the movie, he tells Hazel that he's dying and then bam, fifteen minutes later he's dead and the movie's over. I'm not saying that this was a bad movie, because I really did enjoy it. I just felt that there were somethings missing from the book that made it so alive and wonderful to read. Also, what happened to Augustus' previous girlfriend? Just curious..."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Having not read John Green's book, and missing his targeted demographics by gender and a few decades, the narrator's very early criticism of my favorite teen movie ""Say Anything ..."" had me quickly questioning whether I was going to make it through this one. The greatness of Shailene Woodley soon won me over and I was all in.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a teenage girl named Hazel(Woodley) who was diagnosed with cancer a few years ago, and has remained alive and active thanks to an experimental drug. She is an exceptionally perceptive girl and carries the burden of worrying about how (or if) her parents (Laura Dern, Sam Trammell) will carry on after her death. She attends a teenage support group to keep her parents happy, and bumps into a friendship with a spirited young man named Gus (Ansel Elgort) ... a self-labeled one-legged 18 year old virgin cancer survivor.<br/><br/>You guessed it ... this is a tear-jerker. But it's even more of a love story. Specifically, it's a story about the joy in finding someone to love. While the cancer is ever-present, it's the love story that captures our interest. When the story veers from that, it suffers. The trip to Amsterdam and the segment with Willem Dafoe seems out of place until it's eclipsed by the final scene at the Anne Frank house. I understand the point, but it struck me as forced emotions ... in a movie that was not lacking emotion.<br/><br/>Regardless of all of that, the reason to see this is the genius of Shailene Woodley. Neither she nor Elgort are teenagers, but they perfectly capture the adorable balance between awkward and witty. Woodley's range is staggering (The Descendants, The Spectacular Now, Divergent) and she and Jennifer Lawrence should be blessing us with their talent for many many years to come.<br/><br/>The screenplay was co-written by Scott Neustadler and Michael H Weber who also co-wrote both (500) Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now. Their feel for dialogue and budding relationships is spot on, delivering a level of respect to both sexes. This film is very sweet and filled with grace, and tainted only by the saccharine musical choices and the Amsterdam sequence."

I am a sucker for romance movies and this one outdid them all. This is one of the best love stories of the decade. It's not about cancer, never once in the movie have the actors asked you to pity them because they have cancer. It is a beautiful, tragedy, a movie worth seeing, I'm sure that no matter how many times you see this movie, more than a single tear will slip your eyes. Shaileene Woodley and Ansel Elgort have this chemistry that you envy. I cannot fathom how beautiful this movie is, if you buy the soundtrack after watching the movie, even the soundtrack will make you cry.

This movie was beautifully portrayed. August Waters, why are you so perfect. <3 John Green did a phenomenal job at tricking people to get attached to August Waters rather than instead of Hazel. Even in the book you expect Hazel to die, not Gus. This movie also strays away from conventional movies that end on happy notes, or on a sense that everything is OK. You get a sense of incompleteness and pain. I cant imagine what someone going through cancer must actually feel, however this film made me realize how much more they lose. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!"
"zainabkmoosavi","5","1","3","20 August 2014"," The fault with TFiOS
","The book original book The Fault in Our Stars, is a beautiful work of art that many people do not understand, the see the mask of the love story that is used to explain the beauty of life. In the book, both Hazel and Augustus fall in love each other because of their personalities and how they have similarities and how they share similar ideas about life and death. In the book it shows how they fall in love with each other not because of looks but because they can have actual and real conversations with each other the one that one can only have with someone who really knows them. In the movie it does not show them falling in love for these reasons, instead it becomes your typical cliché love story. Augustus Waters is supposed to be more than a pretty face, he is supposed to be a guy who has a deeper meaning of life and how death is inevitable. The movie does not show their relationship and how it develops. In the book both Hazel and Gus have great relationships with their parents. Hazel mom tries to make the best of everything and is more like a friend than a mom, I could not see this in the movie. Also in the book, Hazel and The Waters become close and have a relationship of their own, his parents love Hazel and what she does for Gus, in the movie they look at Hazel as if she is a stranger. In the book, Isaac and Gus have an almost brotherly relationship. They joke around with each other and understand each others wants and needs. In the movie it shows as if Hazel and Isaac only became friends because of Augustus, which is not true. John Green uses many literally references in his books. The poem about the Red Wheelbarrow was there and that is a key part, except Hazel does not write poems, and Gus notices that. The poem that was supposed to be recited in the airplane on the way to Amsterdam is also missing, which is also a key poem. Hazel and Augustus also have more of a correspondence with Van Houten, which is not shown in the movie. The thing that annoyed me the most about the movie, is that the biggest and major quote the one that the book is based on is missing. The Julius Caesar quote. There are some characters that are missing from the movie and I understand that they could not fit all of them in because then it would make the movie to long, but I feel that Caroline Mathers is a really important person in the book. After reading Caroline's page after she died, Hazel realized that she was a ""grenade"", she also learns why Augustus stared at her when they first met, because she looked like her. Kaitlyn, who is one of Hazel's non cancer friends, brings realness to the book. In the movie, before Hazel meets Gus, its seems that she is depressed and once she meets him her life becomes perfect, it also shows Gus being her whole entire life. In the book, Isaac and Gus are not her only friends. Every girl needs a friend that is a girl, so they can be understood. Hazel talks to Kaitlyn about things she is not a expert in but Kaitlyn has more experience in. Overall, if I had not read the book and memorized it, it would have been a good movie, a bit cliché for my taste but a good movie."

"MovieGrok","6","1","3","17 August 2014"," Good introduction to a very difficult movie topic with minor hiccups.
","The target audience for this film is teenagers and parents, although anyone can go see it. I went with a group of friends 2 male and 3 female. For younger audiences the film is a drama romance that touches on death, cancer, love, and teenage angst all the while weaving in out the experiences of people who struggle with terminal or a debilitating illness. The film is worth seeing but a little buggy. <br/><br/>It is slightly offensive to people of faith, and portrays religion as either kitschy schlock or something to be privately disdained. Not that religion can't fall into the stereotypes that the film portrays, but it would be nice for once for Hollywood to show at least a glimpse of the way the Christian faith is actually been practiced historically instead of the disdainful white suburban stereotypes. <br/><br/>And the male character comes off as overly sanitized in manners, motive, and his completely nude free manpad in his moms basement. Girls may find Gus to be a heart throb but in the real world and in the film there is a sense of unrealism to think that he being 18 has never had sex, and that him withholding his new cancer results from Hazel until AFTER they had sex was altruistic. The odds are more likely, in this day and age, that he has watched tons of porn and 50% of his feelings are tied to just looking for mindless jockish release. <br/><br/>It may have been me, but the vibe I got in the theater is that they shouldn't have had sex. No one cheered or seemed relieved or happy. IT was dead quiet and everyone seemed to be thinking don't do it. The kiss in the Anne Frank museum was actually more of a crowd pleaser. It just seemed that If two people are both seriously sick and have health complications, having sex could be difficult if not disastrous. If I was Hazels father I would have been furious over him putting her at risk like that. <br/><br/>And it's not like they can show him putting on a condom either, so basically the message is if your dying it's OK to have unprotected sex, just don't tell your partner your dying. What is real love anyway? Think of the long term heartbreak created by physically telling someone that you love them then an hour later breaking the news that you'll be dead soon. Would it be a surprise that so many young people today are sexually burned out and emotionally numb by the time they hit their 30's ? <br/><br/>Aside from this the film feels a little condensed and the perspective is entirely that of two rich white kids. I understand a film is a film and you have to pick an angle and time limit but you could almost retitle this movie, ""The Fault in Our White Suburbs"" or ""Suburban heart ache for the first time"". It just seemed a little too lily white and privileged. I mean Hazel gets to meet her favorite author, go to Europe, date another rich white kid, and text on her I-phone from her wealthy family home, with lovingly rich card board parents. It must 'really' suck to have cancer if your black or poor. But I understand again it's a movie and tickets must be sold. <br/><br/>At face value it's not a terrible film and designed to be a tear jerker, most females in the audience seem to cry at least once. And if you have cancer or have a child with cancer the film can provide some sense of common experience with others around the country or world who are struggling with the same emotional roller coaster of anxiety, fear, and existential grief. So despite it's few quirks, affluent centric characters and minor flaws, I would recommend watching this movie."
"KineticSeoul","10","1","3","13 August 2014"," Not a typical teen romance film
","These days with so much emphasis being put into movies with high-tech special effects and things going boom. It's refreshing to have a chance to watch a gem of a film such as this one. Now, I am not one of those audience members that are into romance movies much (maybe during my younger days), especially teen romance movies. But I am so glad I got a chance to watch this teen romance movie. Lot of teen romance movies or dramas these days seems to go into that really sappy, pretentious, delusion direction and just misses it's mark. And seems to target the audience members that likes to eat a bucket of ice cream while watching some superficial cardboard cutouts input on what love is in order to feel that sense of sweetness in their lives (which is understandable). However this movie is like a romantic poetry on screen, this is a bold statement but I would even go as far as calling it modern day Shakespearian story work. Mainly because the story is so well written and it delves into the mindset and the core if the matter when it comes to emotions and heart. So when it comes to the story it's about 2 people dealing with cancer and the relationship between one another. You can let reality crush you and live in denial while trying to forget by means possible or you can stand and fight through and seek (and these are two characters dealing with cancers!). It also wasn't forced to get emotions our of the audiences or did it seem self-indulgent like some art house movies. Sometimes when it comes to movies like this, even the serious scenes sometimes comes off funny because of how cheesy it is, however that wasn't the case for this film. When it came to the funny parts the audiences in the theater was laughing, during the cute scenes they were all chuckling, and during the sad or serious scenes it was dead silent. That my friends is movie magic, as a matter of fact I ALMOST cried...That is a lie, I actually did cried then looked around to see I wasn't the only one in order to not go in that guilt trip. Thankfully, I wasn't the only one, but even if I was the only one, it's okay. Augustus Waters is now one of my favorite leading male character in this genre. He is just so charming, humorous, witty, knows how to use sarcasm in a non-demeaning way and above all the guy has integrity. The couple in this film was so likable, cute and the chemistry was so uplifting that I wanted to get out of my seat and root for them. Overall this is a movie that really tugs on the heartstrings and is not just another teen romance movies that Hollywood seems to be chugging out these days. If anyone including teens and even elders are looking for something to do during date night, check this film out. It will make you fall in love with movies all over again. As a matter of fact this is probably my favorite film of 2014. Oh and the soundtrack is fantastic.<br/><br/>10/10"
"mr-mrs-coop","9","1","3","11 August 2014"," Great film, thought provoking & sad
","It was sad but not for the reasons I'd thought it would be, yes the main girl character - Hazel Grace Lancaster (or something like that) is sick and dying and yes she and the boy Augustus Waters(Gus) fall in love but the love isn't instantaneous love, it is a slow growing love formed around a friendship as described in the movie ""I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once."" It was beautiful to watch develop and I think the cinematography really displayed it so well I felt the excitement, nerves and flirtation.<br/><br/>The thing that I found saddened me was not the fact that Hazel Grace was sick it was more her obsession around what happens when she dies, is everyone going to be okay? It made me think about the comfort we provide to the dying verses what they need from us. It isn't necessarily to provide comfort that they will be OK or we are here for them in their time of ""need"" but that WE will be okay without them. Another line that stuck with me was after the funeral and Hazel had chosen not to read the words she had written she said ""a funeral is not for the dead, it's for those that have been left behind.""<br/><br/>Another thing I found saddening and thought provoking was a conversation late in the film between Hazel and Gus about his fear of oblivion, or being forgotten - he wants to be great, remembered as a hero and have stories written about him and she replies that isn't her love and admiration enough. I found it thought provoking in respect to my own craving for stardom and admiration. It made me question myself and my own relationships with people. Isn't it better to be deeply loved by one person than adored or known by many? Isn't one persons total love and admiration enough? What more do you want in life?<br/><br/>I found this film was layered with so many thought provoking moments and I was still quiet emotional an hour after I'd seen it. The emotion I was expecting (after all that's why I went to see it), it just wasn't the way I expected to feel. I really enjoyed the film ."

","A few friends had recommended the book to me, but since 1. I already had a long to-read list, 2. I have had heard that a movie is coming soon, so I decided to watch the movie instead. Okay, so the date of its worldwide release came and went, without any mention when it's going to release in my country. So, after a month or so later I had already almost forgotten about the movie, but just by chance I had a glance on the name ""The fault in our stars"" in movie show timings in today's newspaper, so just decided to watch it right away. Okay, to the movie 1. Story: okay, so there wasn't anything new to that; I mean, there are already A walk to Remember, Restless and Keith, so, there really wasn't anything I would say that could have blown people's mind. 2. Acting: Good job everyone! I have seen The Descendant, and Shailene's acting was really good in that movie, and here, I wouldn't feel shy in saying she has done a better job. Brilliant! And especially, though I don't want to say it, ""she really looked sick"". The guy, playing Augustus, was also good, but initially I was reluctant to accept his character, but with time it got better. Or it's his good acting that put me on ease. Other characters, well, what I can say about the veterans, except for their appraisal. And William Dafoe, as always, ""never fails"" to make audience hate him. I particularly liked his character and his word. 3. Direction: It was good. The movie was full of little things that really made the whole thing compelling and be felt. Screenplay, at couple of times, there was a little awkwardness, but overall good, or maybe it's the acting that took care of everything. 4. And music too was nice, but they could have included more appropriate soundtracks at a couple of places. :) <br/><br/>And if I decide to go into the details and dig out the dialogues and all, then, apparently, I will be praising the book. So, I'll just stop here by saying that although the story really hadn't anything new to it, yet the movie was good and perfectly watchable, and probably, for some, it could be a great experience. <br/><br/>PS: Since it includes a tour to Anne Frank House, I have to read the book now."
"abouhelier-r","10","1","3","25 July 2014"," Movie Vs. Book: TFIOS
","Hazel and Gus are two teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps then on a journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous given that Hazel's other constant companion is an oxygen tank, Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they met and fell in love at a cancer support group.<br/><br/>The Fault in Our Stars is based on the New York Times Best Seller novel published in 2012, and written by John Green. At first I was a little bit worried to walk into a theatre for another book adaptation to a movie because (1) I loved the book and (2) there are so many of them nowadays. It became a proper trend; but gratefully TFIOS is different. This is a love story. It's a story of joy, devastating loss and most of all, life. It will make you laugh, rejoice, think, feel and will expend your heart with gratitude and humility, as well as change forever the way you hear the word ""okay"". YES it will make you cry! If you are one of the millions of people who have read TFIOS, you know this already. If you're not, prepare yourself as you will not walk away from this book, or this movie unaltered. I cried for the whole movie, if we're being honest. What struck me the most is that I thought I would leave really sad, but instead I felt hopeful and inspired. This movie is an encouragement. One of a kind you can take down into the darkness and it would still give you light. Personally, I read TFIOS the way Hazel falls in love with Gus: ""slowly, and then all at once"". I started out reading it a chapter at a time in between the papers I was grading and then I gave up on grading and read straight through till down. The strength of the film clearly comes from John Green's novel. The beauty of the book, and now the film is that it's a Young Adult novel that brought teens back to reality, which is good after years of popular YA fiction novels and movies revolving around vampires,wizards, deadly games and dystopian universes. That isn't just a ""movie"", Hazel's voice over intones over a close up of Shailene Woodley expressive eyes; but a document that dares to stare terminal illness baldly in the face rather than hide behind euphemisms. TFIOS' end is not that sad if we think about it for a second, it's uplifting and hopeful. It's emphasising the importance of making your days count, even if you have very few left. The movie manages to imitate those different feelings and does a great job of accurately bringing the book to life, thanks to a smart screenplay and dialogues. Plus, there are some aspects of this half-dreamy, half-earthbound romance that the director Josh Boone gets just right. Obviously certain scenes are cut but oddly non of these scenes are particularly crucial to the plot. However they may have helped to add some depth to the character. Mostly, I feel like the movie didn't really missed of anything. In fact, the most important aspect of this romance is the character's chemistry. Shailene Woodley (Hazel) and Ansel Elgort (Augustus) created two vibrant, believable parts filled with humour and intelligence. Hazel is clearly not afraid to die but she's scared of getting too close to people, and what they're going to do, how they're going to live without her. That's probably why it's so interesting to see how her parents deal with the fact that their child is dying. On the one hand Shailene Woodley embodies perfectly Hazel. She's her. She's funny, sarcastic and cynical. On the other hand, not to disrespect how amazing Shailene is in the film but Ansel Elgort is a real star. He's kind of the revelation of the movie. Gus character is tough as his heroic journey goes from strength to weakness, instead of the usual hero's journey from weakness to strength. He seems to have perfectly understood Gus in deep ways. He's brilliant. His character appeared like the best human being ever. By that I mean if everyone was like Gus there will be no problem at all on earth. Once again it's demonstrating how important is a strong supporting character in romance as they are are both overcoming the fact that they're dying of cancer (almost) together. Indeed, cancer provides the butt of the film's most funny jokes, provides the power with which the story starts to squeeze the viewers first tears. <br/><br/>Read the end at http://strangersinp.blogspot.fr/2014/07/movie-vs-book-fault-in-our- stars.html"
"jadepietro","7","1","3","7 July 2014"," To A Fault
","This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>No, the fault is in the story, a simple tale of two teenagers coping with The Big C. Based on the popular YA book, the film, as well as its source, is marketed for an adolescent audience, which is certainly not me. While the subject is adult and serious, the treatment is purely superficial and saccharine. Let's begin to count the ways this weepie manipulates its audience and is a disservice to any cancer survivor:<br/><br/>￼1. The Stereotypical Young Lovers: As with all romantic films, the couple must be good- looking and adorable, but more so, the two doomed partners need to be brave and stoic as they buck the odds to keep their love alive. Here, for your approval are Hazel (Shailene Woodley) and Gus (Ansel Elgot), two teenagers who meet cute at a cancer support group and fall head over heels in love. They suffer, as they must, but as one character ruefully points out,""Pain deserves to be felt."" Unfortunately, I felt the pain and suffered as does the audience as they spout positive bromides about survival and love rather than real teenage conversation.<br/><br/>2. Dumb Plotting: Director Josh Boone helms the story fairly well, amid all the suds. The screenplay is based on John Green's popular novel and Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber rarely stray from the source material. Both set these lovers on a absurd journey to Amsterdam in order to meet a writer (well played by Willem Dafoe) whose book inspired them to move on with their lives. (This particular section of the film is where I gave up all hope for any sense of truth to enter the picture. Especially cloying is a scene in the Anne Frank house that defies any resemblance to reality.)<br/><br/>￼3. Inconsistent Acting: The Fault in Our Stars does have one stellar performance at its core which slightly elevates the movie. Ms. Woodley is the perfect heroine to play Hazel, bringing nuance and a fine degree of distinction to her melodramatic role. She keeps the mellow at bay and is convincing in her dramatic turns. This talented actress invests in her character and so does the moviegoer. Not the same can be said about her co-star, Mr. Elgort, who brings his puppy dog eyes and handsomeness to the forefront. No subtlety here. It's a surface performance without much depth, a look-good-and-read-your-lines performance. This throws the whole love story out of kilter. (Strong support is also given by Laura Dern and Sam Trammell as Hazel's devoted parents, less than good support by Nat Wolff in the thankless role of as their wacky sick friend, Isaac.)<br/><br/>4. Unrealistic Treatment of an Illness: The film is relentless in its shallow depiction of its disease, always looking at the sunny side of life and looking away from the harrowing effects of cancer. Dying is such an unpleasantness, a mild interruption of life in The Fault is in Our Stars. For every realistic display showing the effects of this debilitating illness, there are an infinite number of life-affirming uplifting moments that overplay the characters' circumstances. The couple's grim fates are always just out of reach, but rarely seen in the true context of death. Death is ugly, but not here. The film doesn't want to be too much of a downer after all.<br/><br/>￼5. A Slow Death Indeed: In conclusion, romantic doom is profitable in films. Screen junkies love a good cry. Look at some past winners in this tear-jerking category: An Affair to Remember, Bridges of Madison County, Ghost, Titanic, The Notebook, Dr. Zhivago, and the granddaddy of all soapy romantic movies, Love Story. The rare few that merit our tears can even be exemplary movies, films that have been sensitively rendered: Gone With the Wind, Brokeback Mountain, Brief Encounter and the two films that always do me in, Casablanca, and Roman Holiday. Those films have the words and pictures and stars in perfect alignment. Just as many soap operas before this, The Fault in Our Stars tries hard but it doesn't earn every drop of moisture lodged in those tear ducts. It may get that whimpering reaction by its final scenes, but that's mostly due to the luminous Shailene Woodley. <br/><br/>Well, I guess every generation needs a Love Story. But as for me...I'll always have Paris or Rome. GRADE: B-<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com<br/><br/>NOTE: The film poster uses a clever tag line along with the subtle oxygen tubes to hint at the plight of the lovers. It is concise storytelling with the teenage actors as the film's primary draw for its young audience. The poster outdoes the film."
"netherfield2000","9","1","3","6 July 2014"," Audio Book Version and Movie
","I had been listening to the audio book version of The Fault in Our Stars. It was amazing. The only problem was when I got to the last chapter(s) when all the really sad stuff happens. My choice was to go into my doctors appointment (relatively) on time, or finish the CD/Book. The doctor was running late, luckily and called me. By this point I was crying my eyes out. I tried to explain to her that, no, I wasn't in pain, but the character just died. I was so invested in the story that I was boo-hooing to the doctor about it.<br/><br/>The movie was just like the book. The only thing that I didn't really like was the fact that Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley (mouth-full) do in fact look like brother and sister. I know they played such in Divergent, but it was a tad odd. Also, the character who was half blind, sorry, forgot the name, wore these cheesy looking sunglasses the whole time. I really don't know sunglass brands, but these looked like freebies given away at a trade show. I read the actor wore blinding contacts the entire time, so what was the point? Boo Hoo at movie too."
"ahegartystoneham","8","1","3","6 July 2014"," Not Quite as Good as the Book
","This movie struck my interest before I even knew there was a book, so I decided despite how eager I was to see it, to read the book first which is unlike me and I am so glad I did. It is a difficult task to turn a movie into a book because the readers will never be satisfied. If you read the book then you know that the movie leaves out many parts. I believe the movie would have been a lot better had there been more narration by Hazel because a large percentage of the book she is narrating and is funny and witty and you don't get to see that in the movie. Also one of my favorite scenes in the book when all of them are together and Gus is dying and they are still cracking jokes about how is good looks blinded their friend Isaac. It was that sort of thing that made you fall in love with them. Now don't get me wrong because I'm being a book snob, this movie despite these small flaws, that only those who read the book would see, is beautiful, I still cried my eyes out just like I did when I read the book. The casting is great and you fall in love with Gus as hard as Hazel does."
"louis_sound","10","1","3","4 July 2014"," It's a good life, Hazel Grace
","The Fault in our Stars.<br/><br/>I read the book. I fell in love. Then I fell in love with a person. Then I proceeded to pass it onto my loved one. She fell in love. I fell in love with her falling in love with this lovely book.<br/><br/>Anyway.<br/><br/>My biggest hope (and fear, simultaneously) was that the movie would a) have the wrong casting b) not follow the book and cut and slice into the plot c) ruin the former experience of reading<br/><br/>Turns out I was wrong on all 3 levels.<br/><br/>The Fault in Our Stars has what I consider the most perfect casting for this movie. Everyone more or less converges with their story counterparts and has their story to tell. Each character is memorable by means of acting performance and facial/bodily expressions. Character development here is as intense as was the case with the book.<br/><br/>Okay, so enough about acting, what about my blunt (and totally biased) opinion?<br/><br/>The movie was plain brilliant. I hardly ever cry at movies, even less so when I am in the company of others. I was, I did and I did it a lot (in this case that is not a shameful feat). Hazel Grace, cancer patient and realist versus Augustus Waters, former cancer patient and idealist. The chemistry between the two persona is astonishing and utterly fascinating. I think everyone is a mix of those two dispositions, and we struggle to choose which one to rely on... rendering both persons very easy to relate to. The movie pierces fixed ideas ostensibly set in stone on cancer and adds ideas of its own. Of course, kudos go to Green for the original work, but the movie manages to convey the same defiance, which I believe is a rare occurrence. Does cancer have to define your life? No. Is everyone fighting a brave battle? No. Is it okay to glorify the dead? No. These are all very controversial topics but I agree with each and every one of them to a differing degree. Questioning these delicate topics and considering the way outsiders see cancer vs how cancer patients look upon it is a very needed debate in contemporary society.<br/><br/>The movie managed to pinpoint what made the book so true to life and expand on it, without deviating from the main plot. <br/><br/>Excellent. Intoxicating. Life-changing. Go see this movie now. Or see it again. It matters. It deserves it."
"erinkay641","10","1","3","29 June 2014"," As An Avid Fan Of The Book, I Was Thrilled With The Movie
","Wow. I just left the theater, so I'm still a bit teary. This movie did what is so rare in movie adaptations of books nowadays - it stuck to the story faithfully. The acting is excellent and the pacing is great. At first I was unsure if I liked the lead actors because they were so different from what I pictured when reading the book, but they quickly proved themselves. Ansel and Shailene play off each other very well and they did the characters justice. I was a blubbering mess for the last thirty or forty minutes. The story is beautiful and it carries such a great message. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone!"
"dareent-amethyst","8","1","3","27 June 2014"," Great entertainment
","The fault in our stars is amazing! I was very excited when i first found out about this movie, but when it finally came out i read many bad reviews, so despite how excited i was, i prepared myself to be disappointed when i went in to see the movie. But i wasn't disappointed at all. The fault in our stars is basically just another ridiculous teenage love story but what makes it different than the rest, or better if i should say, is that it's realistic. It's realistic in the sense that life is a bitch and that it doesn't always have a happy ending. Its realistic in the sense that pain, death, and all other bad things are inevitable. That you will get hurt and you don't have a say in it but you do have a say in who will hurt you. I enjoyed this movie so much, i laughed and 'aawwwwed' and cried. It was a little boring at the beginning because the dialogues were a little too long in my opinion, but overall it was great. I give it an 8/10. Although i know why there are some bad reviews- this movie is not for everyone. Its mostly for girls. I dragged my brothers to watch this movie with me and they complained the whole time . If you're someone who's looking for a romantic drama that can make you cry, go see this movie."

The boy becomes worried when the girl becomes delusional, making outrageous claims such as ""I'm a grenade"". The boy knows this to be false seeing as she is not small, metal and oval, but she does wear a pin in her hair one day. This is confusing for him. (Spoiler Alert)But then the boy dies and the girl realizes she was a girl and not a grenade the whole time. The she reads a book. We don't find out for sure if she dies, but come on, she definitely does, rendering all her feelings pointless.

"purplepassion12399","9","1","3","22 June 2014"," One Sick love Story!
","Okay? I know that I'm late writing a review for The Fault in our Stars, but I forget to so here we go. I read the book before the movie which was my goal and I'm really glad that I did. And this is also the first movie I've seen twice which is really cool because it's a movie worth seeing multiple times despite Augustus death. So if you already didn't know this movie is about this girl named Hazel Grace Lancaster(Shailenne Woodley) who is forced to go to a support group by her parents and doctor's behalf. But one day a handsome guy named Augustus Waters(Ansel Elgort)meets Hazel at support group since Issac(Nat Wolff) invited him, and their love story was just the beginning. I was really impressed on how this the movie turned out. Th music went well with the scenes, the actors/actresses did so well with there parts mainly Shailenne, Ansel, Nat, and William Defoe.The Rotterdam trip, Augustus funeral, the cute text messages, Hazel's flashbacks of her procedures,There date dinner. I think the only things that I was kinda disappointed at not seeing was Katiyln, Hazel desperately trying to find Augustus eulogy ,and Augustus brothers and sisters. But you can't fit everything from the book into a film. But overall this is a must see movie that will not only make you cry, but laugh, and smile all the way through. Thank you John Green for this little movie that is a one sick love story!"
"mbelt","10","1","3","22 June 2014"," John freaking Green
","Back in 2012, I read the book for the first time. Little did I know that a little more than 2 years later that I would be seeing John Green's creation come alive on the big screen. <br/><br/>What I LOVED about this movie, and should really be the ""norm"" for all other books turned into movies is that it was incredibly true to the book. And what was left out of the movie, was at least reference in someway or another. Examples: Gus has a poster of the movie ""V for Vendetta"" above his bed - talked about briefly in the book - and Hazel and Gus sitting on the swing - referencing back to the ad they created to sell the swing set in the book. After this movie, I want all movies made from books to have the author sitting right next to the director THE WHOLE TIME.<br/><br/>This movie made me go through a whole box of Kleenex in less than 2 hours. Definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year (so far)."
"predfordam","9","1","3","22 June 2014"," What a surprise!
","Now let me get something out of the way first. I am a 15 year old male who went to see this movie with 4 other guys. We wanted to see what the fuss was about as none of us had read the book. Also, none of us expected ourselves to cry. Well weren't we in for a shock.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. The two leads (Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort) were superb, their realism that they brought to each of their roles worked well and they had a fantastic chemistry between each other which really complimented the movie's storyline. I thought the script was great as it isn't your usual YA sappy romance story, with an overall less cliché feel. However near the beginning I did think the script was a bit cringe-y with the staring and what not, but as the story progressed and became deeper so did the writing become more mature.<br/><br/>As much as hardcore fans of the book say to read it first, I really enjoyed this movie by going in knowing next to nothing about it, and I feel that made the twists all the more hard-hitting. Some scenes brought me to tears, where as others made me laugh with awkwardness. Me and my friends all left the cinema broken and shocked. We now have a pact never to speak of it again. Oops."

","My teenage daughter gave me the book a week before the movie came out. I knew it was teen fiction, and I also knew that a lot of young people (especially girls) were waiting for the movie release with bated breath (and stocking up on tissues in anticipation). I finally went to see the movie with my daughter and it was lovely - though you could probably have sailed out of the movie theatre on the river of tears going on around us by the end of the film.<br/><br/>This is a very faithful adaptation, though it leaves out a lot of the philosophical stuff in the book (that really wouldn't have translated well on screen). The lead actors were excellent and it was interesting that this movie (with a modest budget) out-sold the latest Tom Cruise blockbuster on the same opening weekend.<br/><br/>These 2 young lead actors are definitely worth watching again."

It's beautiful how light of a film it is, despite one of it's major subjects. It includes comedy, romance, passion - everything that can make a person feel...good!

","Okay, it's manipulative. On the other hand if you choose to watch a movie that you know revolves around two young kids, both terminally ill, who fall in love, a love that by definition has nowhere to go, and when the lovers in question are teenagers rather than, say, sixty year olds, then you shouldn't be surprised to be manipulated. My feeling on this is I'll sit still for a little manipulation provided it's being done by pros so that it's polished to a high gloss and acted to a high standard. That, in short, is what we have here. I singled out Shailene Woodley as the best thing in The Descendents a couple of years back and here she lights up the screen and though once again she is the best thing on view the support is light years better than she got in The Descendents so that overall Woodley takes the movie but only by a nose from the rest of the cast. It was probably slightly unorthodox to have a leading man (Ansel Eghort) so stunning as to be an amalgam of Tom Cruise, Tyrone Power, Gregory Peck, Robert Taylor etc and cast him opposite an actress like Woodley, who is NOT chocolate box pretty a la Liz Taylor, Audrey Hepburn etc and make us wait to see that she is Beautiful once she starts to act. For that matter it is inconceivable that a babe magnet like Eghort would be a total singleton. This to one side all the cast are totally believable and we can even forgive the heavy-handed metaphor of a visit to the home of Anne Franck in Amsterdam.Arguably a slick rather than a chick flic but then again why not a Slick chick flic."
"ddoyle2017","9","1","3","19 June 2014"," Pretty Good
","First of all, I don't think this movie deserves the reviews that it has been getting. I know this novel isn't the most dramatic thing in the world, but I still think that a few of the scenes in the movie could've been a little better. For example, the Peter Van Houten scene was too crammed. In my head, I envisioned the room being big, with a gray sofa on which Peter Van Houten was drinking and talking to Hazel and Augustus. In the movie, there's this guy in a wooden chair talking to Hazel and Augustus in this room that is so small. Hazel and Gus are sitting on the couch that I envisioned Peter would have been sitting on. Anyway, enough about that. I did like the acting. I thought that Shailene Woodley did an incredible a fat job of portraying Hazel Grace Lancaster. She did a great job in the scenes where she had to cry or be very happy. I think those emotional scenes, she did very well on. On the other hand, I think that Ansel Elgort could've done a better job in those emotional scenes. I don't know if that is his way of portraying Gus' sense of humor, or if that is just fine that they cast the wrong guy to play Augustus Waters. For example, in the scene where Gus calls Hazel asking for help when he's at the gas station, he kind of just threw up. I think they could've done a better job of having him be throwing his body around in pain or crying. That's just what I think. You guys might disagree with me and think that Ansel did a good job, but I just think they could've found a better Augustus Waters. Let's go back on the topic of Peter. I imagine Peter as being a fat, obnoxious drunk. With their choice of Willem Dafoe as playing Peter Van Houten, I think it ruins the point of the character. Willem is kind of a skinny guy who has a beard and kind of looks obnoxious, but I think they should've gone with someone who had a little more weight on them. Plus, Willem didn't give me the vibe that Peter Van Houten gave me when I was reading the book. It must sound like I'm a pretty negative guy, but here are some good things about the movie. I like how Hazel is narrating throughout the story. I liked all of Gus' jokes and how he would annoy Hazel. I also like that they spent a great deal of time in Amsterdam. The movie really spent a lot of time there, which I thought was great and further developed Hazel and Gus' relationship. I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 because it's just such a good story. I hope you guys found this review useful, and be sure to think about all the suggestions that I made to the movie."
"ivanvv","10","1","3","18 June 2014"," The Answer
","It has been said that the movie is a sick love story. To me, it's a realistic love story. Love must count no matter the length of the time. Death also doesn't mean to an end. By the poetic name of the movie, stars refer to the concept of death in western culture in which death is an ultimate end of one's life. There's nothing more after one's life. When we look close to the storyline, the whole movie emphasizes the fragility of human life and the purity of love. The pipe and the conversation when Peter Van Houten plays funky rap music to Hazel reveal that love is a feeling than an answer. When people look for an answer like Hazel, they will be emotional and hurt themselves. The death of Gus can mean the end of love or the start for Hazel to learn to love, and the answer is from us. The fault seems to be the only answer of death."

Of course Hazel dreams of going to Amsterdam to meet an author called Peter Von Hutton(Willem Defoe)who wrote her favorite book,and her mom and her dad decide that she can go on behalf of the hospital that she goes to get herself looked after.

But overall I was glad I got to see this today as the acting was brilliant,the story has been done before in the past,and this is based on a novel(I don't read any books at all on books turning into movies like Nicholas Sparks novels like Dear John,The Lucky One etc) but this was a good movie and a real tearjerker. I wept at a few scenes particularly at the end of the movie and like I said before the acting is very well done,especially Woodley's performance which hopefully will give her a few awards for this film alongside the guy that plays Gus(who was very handsome indeed).<br/><br/>Overall its a 9."
"biochemist","9","1","3","16 June 2014"," I Really Really Enjoyed 'The Fault in Our Stars'
","First off i must say that i have not yet read the book by John Green. I remember watching the trailer to this movie months ago and thinking that i wasn't completely sold on it. <br/><br/>However, i do know one thing. I do enjoy watching movies starring Shailene Woodley. She is a fantastic actress. I remember seeing her in 'The Spectacular Now' and thinking how great she was. I actually didn't care for that movie, but i did like her performance. She was believable.<br/><br/>'The Fault in Our Stars'... is a great movie. Once again i thoroughly enjoyed Shailene's performance. She just plays the role of the average girl in high school/college so well. She's beautiful, but it's not only her looks which carry such a movie. Her character(s) in these coming of age movies really shines because she gets it and does it (acting) very well.<br/><br/>I felt like this movie was divided into three acts. In the first act, i struggled a bit to find the characters believable, specially Augustus. I felt like his character was trying too hard. It wasn't until the second act when i realized the characters started to grow on me and i found the characters believable. <br/><br/>The third act in the movie is fantastic and really proved to be the strongest for all the characters involved. You really feel for these characters and you're thoroughly invested in their journey together. <br/><br/>The writing is fantastic. Now that i know how much i enjoyed the second and thirds acts, i'd like to revisit the movie again to enjoy it all over again. It could very well be that i didn't ""get it"" from the beginning because it may have had hints of a clichéd teenage coming of age movie with no substance.<br/><br/>This movie is different. There is plenty of substance. The focus is kept mainly on Hazel and Augustus' relationship. These two carry the movie without the need of a big supporting cast. Shailene's performance is fantastic. You really feel for her and her struggles. Specially if you've every known someone who's battled cancer at a young age, specially a teen in high school dealing with the pressures of friendship, fitting in, dating, sex... all of which come with peer pressure. Its all relatable.<br/><br/>By the time the third act shows up on the screen, i dare you not to shed a tear or a few. This movie really pulls at the heart strings and it does so wonderfully because of the fantastically written script (and book i presume). This movie (book) contains some great messages. Enjoy!"

Also, I found it had for me an annoying 'life is beautiful' postcard-y sense about it for such a difficult topic of kids dying of cancer. There was little difficulty or real conflict in the first three quarters of the movie. Laura Dern's talent was completely wasted. Willem Dafoe put in a fine performance as a crotchety, hateful writer, but it wasn't enough to add any real depth to the movie.<br/><br/>I wish I could say I liked it more.

","I don't cry very often - in my group of friends, I'm known as having a heart made of ice. Before I watched the The Fault in Our Stars today, I could not remember the last movie I've cried to, the last one being at least three years ago.<br/><br/>The Fault in Our Stars is a very good movie for the right audience. I'm luckily in that audience, being a 15 year old girl, having read the book also. <br/><br/>In a very specific scene with Hazel talking to her parents about when she'll die of the tough lung cancer she had, it reminded me of what I was doing through doing my half-depression some time ago. There, I dealt with the same feelings - about being forgotten, leaving people behind, and death in general, which I struggled with accepting. Just there, I felt so connected to these characters, even though I don't have cancer, and never have - but it just felt so real, and that's where I cried in the cinema for the first time in my life.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is very, very good. It felt honest, it felt realistic. The script could easily have made this movie into one big sap with soaking cheese, but with the very talented actors and amazing directing, the film avoided that.<br/><br/>Of course, this isn't for everyone. I would say it's mostly for teens around my own age, and if you find yourself having a need to break your own heart and think about your role in the universe, go see TFIOS. And of course everyone else who's interested. I wasn't disappointed, something I tend to be watching book- to-movie adaptations. <br/><br/>If I was John Green, the author of the book, I would be very, very proud."
"con-constanti","9","1","3","14 June 2014"," ""It's just a metaphor""
","with being only half interested in watching the film but yet being dragged by my other-half, my expectation for the film was not at a high, i haven't read the book nor even picked it up yet the film seemed flawless in perfecting the beauty of flawed life. The movie is a roller coaster of emotion in its self that takes you on a journey of many feelings and emotion, knowing that cancer plays a role in who the characters are we are immediately set up for a doomed laps of events, this just helps draw us in as we can only wish for the best outcome like any other love story. <br/><br/>To my understanding john green has created a perfect life within a limited time line or what is as close as perfect can get for these two lovers. something so thoughtful and emotion grabbing has been successfully portrayed on the big screen. the acting was exceptional, both play a convincing role with unmatched chemistry for one another, i give it 9/10 as it does nothing but draw you to the unbound love and affection of such a heartbreaking film, I'm not generally a crier but this almost got me there. the movie is brilliant yet not perfect as most movies aren't but remain exceptional, within moments of hazel and Gus meeting its easy to love how easily they fall in love. If you aren't careful you will be hooked in moments and enjoy every minute of it.... but that wouldn't be so bad."
"phd_travel","8","1","4","23 July 2014"," Surprisingly touching
","You may think you have seen enough terminal romances but surprisingly this one works. Even though you can expect some predictability and clichés, this tear jerker romance is engaging and watchable. It doesn't get too cute too often. Good twist.<br/><br/>Good job on how they made up Shailene Woodley to look tired around the eyes but not too sickly. For this kind of role she is quite dignified and restrained. Ansel Elgort smiles a bit too much at first but later on his sad face is touching. The trip to Amsterdam is enchanting and the valiant visit to Anne Frank's house is quite touching. At first I thought that the pairing would be strange with the sibling casting in Divergent but didn't really figure because the settings are different.<br/><br/>The Willem Dafoe writer thing is a bit annoying but it's good contrast so show how in real life everyone isn't all sweetness when it comes to cancer. The bitterness and bile are the reality check in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall worth a watch."

","Oh my goodness this movie is so freaking great. Like I was just hooked ever since I watched the trailer. And then watching it and the title came I couldn't take my eyes away. Its like watching that I just don't want to watch anything else. That is the greatest movie I have ever watched other Passion of the Christ. Seriosuly that is such an amazing love story and how the actors chemistry in the movie worked so well together making it seem like it was real that I had to remember that it was a movie. Like I just can't believe it. BLEW ME OUT OF THE WATER! I've been looking for the book and can't find it so that right there should tell how amazing this story is. I probably will end up reading it as much as Hazel has read An Imperial Affliction. That is just amazing I seriously cannot stop thinking about the eulogy scene when Hazel described her feelings for Gus it was just incredible. And I can't forget Isaac's when he never wanted to see a world without him in it. It was just incredible and how it ended with ""Okay"", just sealed the deal for me. I'm a guy, a straight guy. But I am literally a sucker for this movie. I just don't care it's incredibly a masterpiece. I'm going to watch this again actually if I have the time and even get me started when the DVD comes out.. it will never leave my DVD player. Thank you so much Shailene for your acting in this it was superb. It also made my crush for you even bigger since Divergent. Seriously that was amazing. The emotion into every feeling in every scene was just incredible. It's just impossible for me to think of anybody else playing Hazel. Dude, Ansel, that was seriously some awesome acting for real. The character you brought to life was just amazing. Hilarious, always keeping a smile no matter what, on every one's face. Just incredible. Seriously, congratulations on this movie it was perfect. I save my 10 for this..."
"rannynm","10","1","4","16 June 2014"," A Summer Love Story Unlike Most
","Never have I seen a movie so heart wrenching as this one. The Fault In Our Stars is an exceptional movie that will have you crying, laughing and anxious all at the same time. It is based on the amazing novel written by John Green. In this movie, Shailene Woodley plays Hazel Grace, a girl diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. Ansel Elgort plays Gus Waters who is diagnosed with cancer as well. They fell in love with each other the way we fall asleep, slowly and then all at once. Their journey goes from meeting their favorite author in Amsterdam to rushing to the hospital for immediate chemotherapy. This movie shows the hardships of being in love and fighting for your life in such a beautiful but realistic manner. I absolutely love this film.<br/><br/>There are so many great aspects about this movie that it's hard to highlight a few. However, one of my favorite things is the whole plot and its meaning. It creatively captures a teenager's perspective of love but also of dealing with cancer. It reaches out to a younger audience but still allows an older audience to enjoy it. John Green knows how to grab the audience's attention by intertwining the two most heart- wrenching aspects of life - love and death. Another thing I really love about the movie is how well it depicts the book it is based on. I read the book a few months ago and I loved how the director put in just enough of the details to keep its authenticity. I didn't feel like there was anything missing. Overall, this movie is extremely great and I want everyone to enjoy it as I did.<br/><br/>My favorite character is Hazel Grace Lancaster. Hazel is witty and smart but also strong and understands things. She teaches Gus a lot about books and how not to be afraid of oblivion. Hazel knows she's going to die but she accepts that and she wants her parents to accept that too. I think a lot of teens going through love or even pain can relate to Hazel Grace. <br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Hazel, Gus and Isaac go to Isaac's ex- girlfriend's house. Isaac's ex-girlfriend, Monica, dumped Isaac because he was going to have eye surgery which would leave him blind. Right before the surgery, Monica dumped Isaac and never even asked if he was okay. Hazel, Gus and Isaac want revenge so they go to egg her house. This part is so funny because Isaac is blind and he can't see where he's throwing the eggs. This struck me as so funny because he's throwing the eggs in the bushes and at the trees but Hazel and Gus try to keep his spirit up by giving him encouragement. It is just a funny scene. I recommend this movie for ages 12 to 18 because it is a lot to comprehend and some of the information about death may be too much for young children. I am 14 and have never cried so much in two hours. This is an amazing movie and I give it 5 out of 5 stars. This is a great movie for teens to go out and watch with friends. It comes out this weekend so make sure you get to watch this movie, you won't regret it!<br/><br/>Reviewed by Jailene A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more film reviews, go to kidsfirst dot org."
"babydoll1921","9","1","4","14 June 2014"," Wow.
","I saw this film late one Thursday night and I was blown away by the storytelling of the film. Not only was it captivating it was also immensely emotional. There were a few faults with it, but not enough to warrant it even close to being bad. The characters of Hazel and Augustus had such great chemistry that it didn't even feel as though you were in the cinema. It felt as if you were watching the life of someone else. My only problem with this film was it didn't quite flow as well as it could have. It jumped from scene to scene and the transition scenes were rough. But that might have been the intention. That was the only fault that I was able to find with it. The story was great and it followed the book more of less (other than rough scene jumps) and it had me crying even after the movie was over and done with. All in all it is definitely a movie to be seen by all ages and by both men and women."
"Ryan_hawbecker","10","1","4","13 June 2014"," The Best Movie I Have Seen This year
","I read the book The Fault in Our Stars earlier this year and loved it. It has become my favorite book I have ever read. So, I had pretty high expectations going into this movie. This is a fantastic film Shailene Woodley is one of my favorite actresses and she does a terrific job playing Hazel. She has amazing chemistry with Ansel Elgort the scenes with the two of them are a lot of fun. The romance between the two of them was believable and never felt forced. Shailene does a great job with the emotional scenes and had me tearing up a few times. I truly believe she should be nominated come Oscar time. Ansel Elgort was also great as Augusts Waters I liked how much he cared for Hazel. The most difficult scene to watch took place at a gas station. He does an amazing job in that scene and I don't think it would have been the same with another actor. This is a very special film and one I hope a lot of people take the time to watch"
"umania333","10","1","4","13 June 2014"," Absolutely fantastic
","You laugh, you cry and you are left emotionally distraught for the next week. The scene where they land in Amsterdam is really upbeat and you can't help but smile. Every time Ansel smiles, you smile. And every time Ansel cries, you cry. This book is very true to the book and if it does change something, it is either very small or you don't even know it was changed. I thank John Green for writing such a great yet heart-wrenching story. I think the casting was amazing, and the whole movie team should be very proud of making a great movie.<br/><br/>Additionally, this movie requires A LOT OF Kleenex. I left the cinema with my eyes all red and puffy and this morning i still felt the same. This movie basically ruins you, but in a good way 😝"

","I knew this movie would be good, no not good - amazing, breathtaking, astonishing, heartbreaking, special, or just something in between that. Reading the book, I found myself non-able to stop. So I had very big expectation for this movie, and God help me I was positively surprised. <br/><br/>Not only had they chosen actors who fit very well with their characters, but they played amazingly with each other. Nothing felt awkward or not right. Shailene Woodley (though I had my doubts) was the perfect Hazel Grace. She knew how she should react, how she felt, how her whole world was supposed to be. It was a pleasure watching her play that role. <br/><br/>I actually thought that I would start crying as soon as the movie started, as soon as the worlds ""The Fault In Our Stars"" would appear on the screen, but I didn't. The beginning was as lovely as the book's beginning. Everything was down to earth and you started to get an idea of what it was like to be Hazel Grace, what you go through when you have cancer and what your priorities are. It is not easy, especially when you're as sick as she is.<br/><br/>But she soon figures out that there is more in life than just cancer, and that thing is Augustus Waters. And their time together is absolutely heartbreaking, but true. I have to say that the journey they have, is why you need kleenexes. It is nothing but real, true and sad, but the thing is, sometimes you need that. You need something that might not have a Hollywood ending, and if you seek that, then this is the movie for you. But please, I was very grateful for my Kleenex, you should have some near you - just in case."
"Hellmant","9","1","4","10 June 2014"," I don't usually go for cheesy teenage melodrama or painfully bad tragic love stories.
","'THE FAULT IN OUR STARS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>A romantic drama film based on the bestselling book (of the same name) by John Green. It stars Shailene Woodley as a 16-year-old cancer patient who falls in love with a cancer survivor (played by Ansel Elgort), that she meets in a support group. It was directed by Josh Boone (who also directed the 2013 romantic drama flick 'STUCK IN LOVE') and written by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (the duo also wrote '(500) DAYS OF SUMMER' and 'THE SPECTACULAR NOW', which also costarred Woodley). It costars Nat Wolff (who also costarred in 'STUCK IN LOVE'), Laura Dern, Sam Trammell and Willem Dafoe. I don't usually go for cheesy teenage melodrama or painfully bad tragic love stories but this movie isn't either of those things. It's actually a well made and moving film that offers up another stunning performance from Shailene Woodley! <br/><br/>Woodley plays Hazel Grace Lancaster; a 16-year old cancer patient who lives in Indianapolis, Indiana with her parents (Dern and Trammell). Elgort plays Augustus Waters; a 17-year-old cancer survivor who rid himself of osteosarcoma by having one of his legs amputated. The two meet at a cancer support group that Hazel's parents force her to go to. Augustus is there to support his friend, Isaac (Wolff), who's now gotten cancer tumors in both of his eyes. Augustus immediately takes a liking to Hazel, after running into her outside of a meeting, and then proceeds to stare at her and hit on her (after the meeting concludes). The two watch a movie together (at Augustus's house) and then recommend books for each other to read. They continue to develop a relationship as Augustus tracks down the author (Dafoe) of Hazel's favorite book (a book about a cancer patient much like herself) and they attempt to get answers from him about the book's inconclusive ending.<br/><br/>I'll start by saying I'm becoming a huge fan of Shailene Woodley. Much like her buddy (Jennifer Lawrence) I find her to be a very inspiring and likable person (in interviews at least) and also think she's an amazingly talented actress. She's once again excellent in this film and delivers an Oscar worthy performance; she's also the main reason I wanted to see this movie. I haven't read the book and if Woodley wasn't in the movie I probably would have had no desire to see it either. I'm glad I did though and Shailene is the main reason but it's a good film in many other ways as well. Neustadter and Weber are great film writers; I love their other work (especially 'THE SPECTACULAR NOW') but they also obviously had good stories to work with (adapt). Boone is also a good director; I loved 'STUCK IN LOVE' and look forward to seeing many more movies from him in the future. The supporting cast is all decent in it as well but Elgort is especially a great match for Woodley; the two have beautiful chemistry together and they do make the story seem romantic (which is a little odd considering they played siblings in their last film, 'DIVERGENT'). The movie is touching (and funny in places) but I'm sure it's even more moving for those who can more directly relate to the subject. It deals with the issue in a seemingly effective way and never feels forced or overly done. Although the film might look (to some) like it reeks of the bad taste of similar themed movies, it doesn't. It's a well made film and another triumph for Shailene Woodley.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xzh1FLmMq4"
"jacob-m-ford97","8","1","4","7 June 2014"," Fault in Our Stars Review
","The Fault in Our Stars is a story about young life, love, and living while you can. Based on the 2012 novel written by John Greene, this film tells the story of Hazel Grace and Gus, two teenagers living with different kinds of cancer. Hazel, the more pessimistic of the two, knows she has limited time left and chooses to let the clock tick without making something happen. The story begins with Hazel meeting the charismatic Gus at a stereotypical support group. Gus immediately chases after her affections and what follows is a beautiful story of what life is like for the not-so-typical American teenager falling into the arms of young love. <br/><br/>Leading this small but powerful cast is the phenomenal Shailene Woodley, in the role of Hazel Grace. Woodley practically carries the film on her shoulders being the entire focus of the film, and she does an incredible job of it. The emotional ups and downs her character endures over the course of the story were hard ones to keep up with, and hard ones for a 16 year-old boy to relate to, but I was immediately taken by the power of her character and the realities she faced, and the realities actress Shailene Woodley portrayed so well. In my opinion, Woodley's performance is by far the best seen in a 2014 film so far, and will be hard to top. Starring opposite Woodley is Ansel Elgort, playing the bold and practical Gus. Elgort's performance honestly put me off a bit. The character he developed was great, however it did not match the screenplay he was given beforehand, which made the character of Gus difficult to relate to. This was minor, however, and in no way took away from the whole of the film. Also starring are Laura Dern and Sam Tremmel doing an excellent job as Hazel's parents, Natt Wolf as Gus' best friend, who's purpose was honestly difficult to understand, and Willem Dafoe as Hazel's temporary idol Van Houten. Josh Boone took the director's chair for this picture, whose screenplay was provided from Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber adapting the novel of John Greene. Neustadter and Weber did an excellent job with their adaptation, keeping necessary story plots, eliminating portions that would fit well for a book but would struggle on the screen, while holding dearly on to the abstract and poetic words of author John Greene. Director John Boone's work was hardly noticeable in this film, which is always debatable whether or not that is a good quality. Here, I believe it was. What Boone did allowed the viewer to step into Hazel's small world. A small world filled with countless infinities. There were no extraordinary shots, camera angles, or certain scenes that left watchers breathless; instead, we were there with her. Sitting on her bed waiting for those special texts filled with so much more than a three word message, climbing stairs that felt like both an impossible mountain and the finish line of a marathon, and seeing everyone you care about so much love you more than you can imagine. The work done by these filmmakers did not take us anywhere special, but they allowed us to see life here on earth at its fullest: valuing the people you're with above anything else, whether it's in the form of romance or friendship and especially family at its very best. The Fault in Our Stars is not a movie about cancer. It is a movie about love in all of its truest forms. So as I sat in the theater watching the credits roll with other viewers walking past me wiping their eyes, I smiled. And that's exactly what a movie should do. I give The Fault in Our Stars an 8.6/10."
"thealphakeno","9","1","4","7 June 2014"," A book that comes to life
","The Fault In Our Stars was literally a book comes to life. It was a great movie but for a non-book reader it was a purely perfection. I read the book before they planned to make a film adaptation of it and I can say to you that it tore me apart that time. The book did well making me cry like a baby girl as I read it.<br/><br/>I rate it 95% for its perfect plot. The acting was great although I never imagine Shailene as Hazel and Ansel as Gus, but they still did the role right. For a typical Romance/ Drama/ Comedy movie, this is entertaining and it will be more, if you haven't read the book first. The problem is that I know what will gonna happen so in my case or the book readers, there is no suspense at all.<br/><br/>There is just a little disappointment when the scene from the book, most are tear jerking scene and my favourite scene are missing. Most of it is those unforgettable lines and quotes which I was hoping to see in the big screen.<br/><br/>The first was Isaac's talking computer. Those moments are funny yet it was not including in the film. John Green's cameo is missing too and the complete scene of the funeral where Hazel opens the casket. The lines like ""My thoughts are stars I can't fathom into constellations.""; and ""I love you present tense.""<br/><br/>Moreover, you will enjoy the film. I just can't decide whether you need to read the book first before watch the movie, but I can tell you the book brings you lot of emotion and tears."
"stephiefour","10","1","4","7 June 2014"," Best Movie of All Time
","I am a fourteen year old girl, so my opinion may not matter to many people looking for a true review. However, I do believe that out of many of my friends and classmates, I am able to write an honest review without my teenage personality getting in the way. With that said, I recommend, if you are looking for a legitimate review before you watch this movie or spend money and time watching it, to read this review. I will not include any spoilers because I hate when that happens to me as well. I read the book about three months before this movie came out. It was before they released the trailer for it too. I simply read it for a class project and not just for the upcoming movie. To be completely honest, this was the first book I read that has a movie that goes along with it. When starting the book, I did not expect to love it as much as I did. To put things in perspective, I have read it five times and highlighted and annotated the whole thing. But that's the book, not the movie. My point is, I really think that you should read the book before watching the movie. If you haven't, please do because you will appreciate the movie so much more. I went to the movie in theaters the day it came out with friends. I did not buy the tickets online because I truly didn't expect it to be really crowded since they had so many times that night. However, the line was unbelievably long to just get into the theater! And no, it was not just teenagers. I love that. I loved how this book/movie did not just target teenagers like critics and people may say. There was so many ages there! Old, young, college, 30s; every age. I also probably saw at least 15 people I knew from my school alone. The reason I tell you this is that this book/movie is for everyone! Now to the movie: it was incredible. I won't spoil anything like I said earlier. the acting was fantastic. I felt everything the characters felt. It had every single person in the packed theater laughing every 30 seconds and then crying their eyes out every other 30 seconds. It was a roller coaster of wonderful emotions. It went EXACTLY with the book (with minor changes that didn't change the plot or storyline so it didn't annoy me at all, I actually liked the small changes a lot). It took so many direct quotes from the book and it made it feel like this genius book that I love came to life! Another thing I loved is how the actors/actresses they chose matched how I invisioned each character in my head! Like I said before, I read this book before any news was said about the movie. I especially liked Ansel Elgort (Gus) because he was the perfect Gus in my mind. At first I was skeptical with him, but once he made his first appearance in the movie, I knew he was absolutely perfect. What made me so happy as well, was the setting of each scene. I feel like every scene that they were somewhere different, was just beautiful. The sky was never gloomy, the places were lively, and just overall gorgeous. Not every movie always has that and it really added to the feel. I cried so much from beginning to end that my mascara ran down my face. Luckily, I went home right after. It was actually embarrassing at some points because I wasn't sobbing, I was full on crying. My mouth was quivering and I was breathing heavy and my nose was running. This movie has to be one of the best, if not THE BEST, movie I have ever seen. I am definitely going to see it again in theaters and buy the DVD when it comes out. Absolutely beautiful. I am quite sad now that it's over but, the world is not a wish-granting factory so I guess I'll have to live with it."
"marlieiskool","10","1","4","6 June 2014"," Go F*** Yourself.
","I would like to say go f*** yourself, John Green. This movie, this book was fantastic. (you thought this would be a hateful review, right? Well, no.) I cried, and god damn cried threw all of the movie. It gave me a sense of hope that you can find love anywhere in any situation. I've loved this book, and was sceptical about the movie since a lot of movies that were formed from a book is never that great but this, this went above AND beyond. I can't say how much it felt when I saw it was almost the same as the book and the actors did a great job making the characters come to life. <br/><br/>Hazel (Shay): Can I say that Shayilene Woodley was the PERFECT girl for Hazel. I'm not going to lie- I did have my doubts about her but overall, I loved her performance and felt the connection to her character. She did Hazel well. <br/><br/>Gus (Ansel): He was my favourite out of all, to be honest. His emotion, his expression. I literally felt like Gus was actually real, and out there, you know? I can't stress enough that if someone else was playing Gus then I don't think it would be as great as it is.<br/><br/>Isaac (Nat): Can I say the hell is wrong with Monica? Isaac was sweet, and hilarious. He believes in true love, and was the most awesome character(He's my second favourite BTW). He, Nat, is extremely gorgeous (my legs are always open, Nat ;)). I don't understand how she didn't want to date a blind guy, I mean, just because he's blind doesn't mean anything.#SMH<br/><br/>I loved this book, the characters and the movie. If you are having doubts, you shouldn't. It's the best I have EVER seen. The scene where they were sitting on the park bench and he was telling her- Oh god, I cried like a f***ing baby. It was so real, so realistic, I thought I was watching a documentary. Koodos to the director, the producers and the cast. i loved it!"
"misha1998","10","1","4","6 June 2014"," Woodley delivers her finest performance of her career in one of the best films of the year.
","The following is a review of one of the best films of the year. Everyone was literary sobbing in the theater once the film killed off Augustus -- it would most likely be even more sadder if they showed it on film. But you can still feel the emotional effect of the film's characters because they look and feel so real. <br/><br/>The film has one of the finest performances of Shailene Woodley's career -- she deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Williem Dafoe, while he has a very short role as Van Houten, his performance haunts us because his downfall can happen to anyone. Laura Dern, who I have not seen since watching Blue Velvet did a great job in her performance.<br/><br/>This is very much like the ""Citizen Kane"" of all romantic dramas. The film is a mystery, a romance and a comedy. It is also a tragedy, much like Romeo and Juliet. <br/><br/>The ending to this review: I urge you to go see this. This is a great movie, all in all.

","I saw this in the Philippines where every seat was taken and people even sat on the floor and at the back they were standing. I sat in the front row as I often do for quiet but every seat filled there too. Somehow the locals knew it was good even second day of release. I was told the book was very popular there. In fact people were calling out the names of characters as they made their first appearance. The ingenuous response of the Filipino audience was almost as touching as the movie itself. I am a bloke and even before I felt sad, tears were streaming. I have never experienced that before. Weeping before the sad bits came. I can't account for it. And I usually don't cry being a man and all. If you don't cry during this you would have to be a sociopath. It is beautifully put together. What a movie. It is corny of course but sophisticated heartfelt corn and not actually overdone. The acting has been acknowledged as great and yes the female lead was excellent. But I was most impressed with the male lead Ansel Elgort. This guy for me stole the whole movie with his performance. He was magnificent especially since he was only19 when he did this movie. All the acting and photography was excellent. William Dafoe also did a great job as you would expect. I thought Hazel Grace's mother was performed exceptionally well. As I came out of the show holding back the tears there was a long line of people waiting for the next session."
"ThomasDrufke","9","1","5","7 June 2014"," Lives Up to the Hype, and Bring Your Tissues
","I think in terms of being able to portray real emotion on screen and capture the perfect amount of sadness with just one face, there is no one better in Hollywood than Shailene Woodley. Whether it's the one short scene in Divergent or the near 10 scenes in this movie, she is perfect at crying. And for the most part, the entire cast executes as well. Ansel Elgort was surprisingly great as the cocky but truly caring Augustus Waters. Laura Dern perhaps had one of the best performances of her career and even Sam Trammel, Nat Wolff and Willem Dafoe shined in their small but significant roles. As much sadness as this movie will bring to people, especially those who have had or know somebody who has had cancer, it can also be very uplifting.<br/><br/>From what I hear, the movie is nearly a perfect transition from book to film, and I can say there isn't much they could have done better. It does take awhile for the emotional scenes to hit, but when they do it's hard to hold back the tears. Also, i really liked how the trailers gave us the gist of the story without showing too much. I was surprised a few times with where the story went, and I compliment 20th Century Fox for giving us a great marketing campaign.<br/><br/>The chemistry within the entire cast was impeccable. If i'm comparing it to Spectacular Now, I would say this movie has the edge in balancing emotion with slight humor, and even being more gutsy. As Shailene Woodley said, there aren't many movie posters that show a beautiful girl using an Oxygen Tank. They very easily could have taken Shailene Woodley and Elgort and just left out any signs of cancer. Woodley has a bright future and if she keeps choosing her roles wisely, then she will one day hold an Oscar.<br/><br/>Like I said there are roughly 8-10 scenes where you may cry, and for a film to do that and still manage to be uplifting at the same time is quite the accomplishment. It's one of my favorite movies of the year so far, and for the performances and near perfect directing it should be seen in theaters.<br/><br/>+Woodley is getting better and better <br/><br/>+Emotional scenes hit the exact right amount of times <br/><br/>+Few surprises <br/><br/>+Depressing, but still manages to be uplifting at the same time.<br/><br/>9.6/10"
"AbigailBirkhimer","10","1","5","7 June 2014"," My new favorite movie of all time
","I can't even put words to how much I loved this movie. I went in expecting to see an amazing book turned into a bad movie, but I was so wrong. Shailene and Ansel had such great chemistry! Their performances were Oscar-worthy. The rest of the cast did a great job too! When Shailene/ Hazel cried over Gus, I too was bawling (as was the rest of the theater). Ansel played Gus in such an amazing way that even before the sad parts came I got teary eyed. This is also very true to the book. I have been a nerd-fighter (John Green fan) since 2012 and I could only spot a few minor changes. Nat Wolff was surprisingly a great choice for Isaac. During the trophy scene he was hilarious and the whole theater was giggling. Warning: you will need two boxes of tissues at least! If this movie doesn't win at least an Oscar I will be shocked. Everything about the movie was perfect! Definitely my new favorite movie!"

","The Fault In Our Stars. Another book turned movie in recent years due to peoples inability to make stuff up themselves. <br/><br/>We have the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster played by the lovely Shailene Woodley (who seems to be on her way to becoming the new Jennifer Lawrence. She doesn't really need the replacement already but I digress) and Augustus Waters played by Ansel Elgort. <br/><br/>Now to be fair I did read the book but I went into this strictly to see how well it was as a movie and you know what? It was actually pretty enjoyable. You can tell it's definitely aimed at the young adult/teenage audience with it's attractive young actors, teenage humor and well... young love. Do these things take away from it for adults? Wellll if they didn't read and enjoy the book then most likely. I sat in a packed house of teenage girls, their mothers and boyfriends who looked like they really didn't want to be there. I left the theater and didn't hear anything but weeping from about 90% of the crowd. <br/><br/>Alright let's look into the story. Hazel is a young cancer patient who's lungs don't work properly but doctors have given her an air tank to drag around and help her breath. She goes to cancer support groups where she meets Augustus Waters, a young, philosophical man who lost his leg due to his cancer. Over time they begin to develop feelings for each other. She shows him a book that she loves and he decides that he will use his make a wish foundation wish to let her meet the author of said book. Upon meeting him he turns out to be a drunk who wants nothing to do with them. To make up for what the author did Augustus takes her around Amsterdam to see the sights and she admits that she has fallen in love with him. The next day he admits that his cancer has returned with a vengeance and he doesn't have long to live. Hazel and her friend Isaac (played by Nat Wolff, who actually does a great job in this role)write Augustus eulogies before he dies so that he may attend his own funeral. Augustus sadly dies 8 days later and at his funeral the author returns to give Hazel a letter that Augustus wrote for her. <br/><br/>A very long and complex story gives you enough humor and tear jerking moments to keep lovers of the book and lovers of the romance genre satisfied. Along with that, it follows the source material very very well. John Green himself said the movie followed his book very well. They leave out little details but they're all forgivable. A movie that follows it's source this well is a rare find these days but I'm very happy with the final result. An A+ book gets an A+ retelling on the big screen.<br/><br/>What about acting? People are saying Shailene Woodley gave the best performance and I won't deny that she did a great job portraying Hazel but honestly to me the stand outs were Ansel as Augustus and Willem Dafoe as Peter Van Houton (the drunk author). My guess is most males are going to say Ansel was just playing the pretty boy role that anyone could do but honestly I thought he was a very enjoyable person to watch. I laughed at all his jokes, I felt myself welling up when Hazel finds him slowly dying at the gas station. Willem Dafoe also was very enjoyable to watch, he makes a good drunk, I'll give him that. One of the big surprises here out of everyone was Nat Wolff as Isaac. You remember him? From The Naked Brothers Band on Nickelodeon? That guy has really matured and grown as an actor and I'm glad. It's good to see child stars grow up to do good things. <br/><br/>The verdict. The Fault In Our Stars is a faithful, light hearted, retelling of a great novel. <br/><br/>a solid 9/10 for me."

apparatus as just part of her person now. Her parents naturally worry about 
over straining herself, but Woodley is determined to lead as active a life as she
can.<br/><br/>At a cancer survivor support group she meets Ansel Elgort who has really made
quite a name for himself since this film came out. Elgort is a former basketball star who lost a leg to cancer. He is so incredibly quirky and charming in this
part I'm surprised he didn't get Oscar consideration.<br/><br/>The two make a trip to Amsterdam to visit an author they admire. Willem Dafoe however has less than meets the eye, still they have a good time. When
they visit the Anne Frank house the symbolism is certainly not lost on the
viewer.<br/><br/>The title is a play on Cassius's famous quote from Julius Caesar about the fault
not lying in our stars but in ourselves. There's no fault here for Woodley an

","A terminally ill girl suffering from lung cancer meets a boy with a very difficult condition of his own who is about to change her life forever. A very close friendship is born between the two but it will not remain as such for long. As they spend more time together and understand each other's situation, their relation evolves, making the final part of their life more than bearable. As a final wish, he takes her to Amsterdam to visit the author of her favorite book but their adventure will not be without obstacles as illness never sleeps.<br/><br/>It's a movie which follows the lives of two teens, deeply traumatized by their condition, who manage to find comfort in each other's arms, struggling every day not to lose faith. Their drama is presented in great detail, from the moment they first met, going all the way to Amsterdam in search of answers regarding their book. We're faced with two very complex characters, very well designed and described, not to say how they're excellently played by their respective actors, who transmit a plethora of emotions, making themselves extremely pleasant throughout the movie, despite their illness. You're bound to burst into tears many times throughout, as you'll find it extremely hard to see their struggle.<br/><br/>The plot is very well designed, managing not to be predictable or linear, bringing something new and quite unexpected with every occasion it gets. The unique atmosphere it creates simply draws you into it, keeping you attracted, interested and curious about the faith of the two. It generates plenty of drama and thrill along the way, but also raises the mood and even makes you laugh once in a while. The end to their story is as unexpected as it is tragic and sentimental, but in a good way. I cannot express the emotions I felt during this movie, every single word simply being insufficient in providing any explanation.<br/><br/>Overall, it is very dramatic but at the same time it brings laughter when you least expect it and romance in its purest way. This movie can cause a lot of tears but it will also bring warmth in one's soul if he or she lets it. It's simply breath taking in every aspect, from its gorgeous story to its presentation, cast and finale. Make sure you don't miss this wonderful masterpiece!"

","The Fault in Our Stars is a world-known book written by the best- seller author John Green. The movie was released after two years of the book's debut, in 2014. A lot of people may say the book is incredibly better than the movie, and I will agree in some parts, but the movie is actually a sweet rom-com that will make everyone want to fall in love after watching it.<br/><br/>First of all, the choice of actors was extraordinary. They thought really carefully about how faithful it could be and tried their best. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort make the perfect couple as Hazel Grace and Augustus Waters, their chemistry is tangible. Concerning the plot, I had my worries about straying too far from the book, but they just nailed the adaptation. John Green himself kept up with the recording of the movie and that says something about the truth of the movie.<br/><br/>Besides being similar to the book, the movie is well-written and has nice photography. In addition, the scenarios are very beautiful and well-chosen. Also, the soundtrack fits perfectly the kind of romantic and sad story that is being narrated, and it makes you feel way more emotional about everything. <br/><br/>I thought about this movie a lot after leaving the movie theater and I couldn't decide if I was angry or happy about the movie being so good. I know a bunch of people criticize a movie that doesn't have a complex and deep background, but this movie is the perfect movie to watch by yourself at home on a Friday night. You will get involved with the lives of such innocent characters, who believe in love and who can fight everything to have a little piece of it.<br/><br/>If you're wondering about the story itself, I can tell you something to make you want to watch the whole movie. So, it's kind of a simple love-story, except the main characters have cancer and they're just teenagers, which just make you more immersed in their universe. Other than that, the quotes you get from this movie makes you want to go to your diary and write them down. Plus, along with the heartbreaking love that Hazel and Augustus live together, there are lessons about friendship and family and how it is great to be surrounded by people who care about you. <br/><br/>With all that in mind, I think people will hate this movie or absolutely love it, and I'd much prefer if they do love it. Maybe it is just another romantic movie, but, I mean, who doesn't love romantic movies, right?"

","The Fault In Our Stars is a film directed by Josh Boone based on the John Green novel of the same name (The first time his novel is adapted to a film). <br/><br/>Now let me confess I am not a person who see's romantic films. I would rather watch films of action genre. Even when I read a one line summary about the film I wasn't ready to see it. Because I thought it would be overly melodramatic. But then many people said me it's actually not that. And when I saw the film I thought how wrong I was. <br/><br/>Plot: Hazel and Augustus meet at a support group and fall in love with each other.<br/><br/>Story: If you see the film, in the very first scene only you get a hint at the ending of the film (I actually guessed the ending of the film and YES I WAS RIGHT). The story has basically nothing new in it. The setting is little bit changed to 2 people who are actually battling for their life. I also began to guess some of the scenes. Which is the only ""fault"" in this film. But still I was feeling joyed and excited in every scene that I was seeing. That is the magic of the screenwriters and directors. They create a world in which you love to swim. That is why the film actually caught hold of me (even though I knew most of the scenes). <br/><br/>There are many things that differed from the novel. But I will highlight the 2 which I thought were important: 1) Ansel died quite quickly in the novel. 2) Hazel forgives van Houten during the funeral scene. The reason I highlighted these 2 things is because I liked the way these two things were not shown in the film. Because actually the essence of the film quite die.<br/><br/>Now since I saw an extended version of the film, I would actually give light on some of the scenes that was not in the theatrical version: 1) The first would be the scene where Hazel tells her Mom that Gus is ready to take her to Amsterdam and after the scene they go to the doctor to ask for permission which she declines. I guess this was quite important to show the care of the mother for her child. 2) Another one is toward the end where Hazel takes Gus to the hospital and on the way she recites the poem ""The Red Wheelbarrow"". This scene is too important as it tells more about how strong is the relation between Gus and Hazel.<br/><br/>Acting: Shailene Woodley is actually the main protagonist of the film. She did an excellent job as Hazel. As the director had said once, Within ten or fifteen seconds of Shailene's audition, I knew she was Hazel. She held up her script pages and just her eyes were peeking over them."" I couldn't see anyone as more convincing as her. I would also say the very same statement for Ansel (as Augustus). He too was very good. William Dafoe as the alcoholic author was great. And the rest of the supporting cast too especially Laura Dern as Hazel's Mother. She killed it with the emotions as a mother whose child is suffering.<br/><br/>Favorite scene: I guess it would be the scene where Hazel and Gus meet after the support group session for the very first time. Then Gus puts a cigarette in his mouth and Hazel is surprised. The reply to Hazel in that scene was actually something that grasped and fascinated me a lot.<br/><br/>Verdict: I loved the film a lot. As I said, the only ""fault"" in the film is that I have seen things like these many times. But still I enjoyed the film. <br/><br/>SO I would give it a 9/10."

But then, some typical Americanisms appeared (e.g. related to eggs and funeral rehearsal) and when one started to guess the ending, then it was not that catchy anymore, at times even protracted (in the Anne Frank House, for example).<br/><br/>True, I realize that I do not belong to the target audience, as well as I have never experienced respective issues in my environment, but I often felt that the movie in question was made for attracting audience and making big money, vis-à-vis e.g. 50/50, dealing with related topic.

"brchthethird","4","0","3","11 February 2015"," An overly contrived and deliberately depressing slog
","Based on the best-selling novel by John Green and starring Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, THE FAULT IN OUR STARS is an occasionally poignant, but contrived, story about love and life. The plot is really easy to summarize, as it follows the basic YA formula of having two people who are quite different enter into a romance with each other. The only difference, and what I feel to be most contrived part of all, is that both of them have cancer. I wouldn't necessarily call myself cynical, but this seems to me like one of the cheapest ways to get audience sympathy. I suppose John Green set out to write a ridiculously depressing tearjerker of a novel, and for its target demographic it seems to have worked like a charm. However, I am not so easily swayed and this film didn't work on me the way it might work for others. That's not to say it wasn't well-made or well-acted, because it is, but the story felt deliberately constructed to get a certain reaction and in that respect, again for me, it failed. Neither one of the leads was particularly likable or interesting to me, and some of the dialogue they were given to say felt odd and unnatural: stuff I can't really picture teenagers actually saying. I also thought that the voice-over was a weak point, as it kind of gives away the endgame a little too early and removes tension about the main character's survival. Still, it wasn't all bad. I did enjoy the segment of the film in which Hazel and Augustus travel to Amsterdam to meet the writer of Hazel's favorite novel, ""An Imperial Affliction."" I won't spoil the cameo for those who haven't seen the film, but I enjoyed his character and the brutal honesty he portrays, despite him being somewhat of an a-hole. I also did appreciate some of the conclusions that the film draws about the relationships we have with others and what we leave behind. It's just a bit sad that the film wallows in so much misery and self-pity to get there. Not having read the book and not usually liking this type of film, I already know that this probably wasn't meant for me. Still, I like to go in with an open mind and give certain things a shot, especially when they're generally well-received. I'd hesitate to call this a bad film, but I will say I didn't like it. Fans of the book will probably love the hell out of this, but I was left mostly cold."

To me, this movies was amazing, beautiful in all ways."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","0","1","30 December 2014"," Could change the way films address people with challenges and differences
","The cure for cancer is still an exhausting search, but the cure for bad movies about cancer has finally taken affect. A few years ago, Jonathan Levine's ""50/50"" changed the portrayal of and dialogue about cancer in movies. Fast-forward to 2014 and the TV show ""Red Band Society"" and this film adaptation of John Green's ""The Fault in Our Stars"" are normalizing cancer in teenagers. It's a weird trend to highlight, but if Hollywood can start treating other ""taboo"" subjects the same way, there's hope for film as a meaningful teaching tool yet.<br/><br/>""The Fault in Our Stars"" begins by essentially scoffing at picture-perfect love stories. Its narrator, Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a Stage IV thyroid cancer survivor not even 20 years old, warns us that this story will not have a happy ending. She's right, but that said, you won't be blindsided by some Nicholas Sparks tearjerker move either.<br/><br/>Hazel doesn't know her timeline, but she knows her cancer is terminal. She carries an oxygen tank with her everywhere she goes, including a support group that she only attends to keep her mother (Laura Dern) and father (Sam Trammell) happy. But it's there, ironically, where she meets Augustus, or Gus, (Ansel Elgort), an osteosarcoma survivor with a prosthetic leg and an impressively positive yet realistic attitude about life. Both of them witty, sharp and sarcastic, Hazel and Gus become fast friends and their romance grows in spite of Hazel's best intentions to avoid falling in love.<br/><br/>There's a terrific sense of humor and approach to cancer in this script that even makes ""50/50"" seem dated. The characters are not defined by their illnesses but by their attitudes toward life, the way they cope with the ups and downs. Hazel and Gus are surprisingly mature for their age, partly because they're written so well but also because they've been through a lot and ripened at a young age. They still feel like teenagers though, and that's key.<br/><br/>Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, writers of the outstanding ""(500) Days of Summer"" and ""The Spectacular Now"" nail it again with the chemistry between Hazel and Gus. Obviously much credit belongs to Woodley and Elgort, but these writers know how to craft real, authentic dialogue. They so effortlessly evoke our own memories of love and life's challenges at a young age in addition to creating compelling drama.<br/><br/>They've also got modern teenage relationships down pat. There's just enough use of phones here to make texting a meaningful component of Hazel and Gus's relationship, but not so much that the movie is overbearingly ""contemporary."" Director Josh Boone handles these scenes delicately and in a way that's true to those who have experienced romance develop through text. But anyway, these characters are in the business of making real connections; after all, they've been through more hardship than a majority of kids their age.<br/><br/>The movie is the story of their relationship, which doesn't become a romance for them as quickly as it does in the audience's mind. Trained to know in movies when two people should fall in love, we are conditioned to look for a first kiss scene well before it happens in this movie, which reflects the inherent, largely unspoken challenges of Hazel and Gus's relationship. As much as teens will gravitate toward this film, it's the adults — who know the heartbreak, who know what teenage romance is like, who would likely tell these two to be cautious — that will most appreciate the story's attitude toward love and relationships. In a lot of ways, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" could be a great film for teens and their parents to begin to have conversations about these things.<br/><br/>Even though the opening narration insists that the story won't sugarcoat anything, it doesn't mean it's free of melodramatic twists that ratchet the drama and sadness up to 10. The approach to scene work and dialogue and characters is more authentic, but the plot doesn't exactly follow suit. In the story's defense, however, we'd have a very boring film on our hands without something to really challenge these characters. Even if you might argue their lives have been challenging enough, it's still a movie.<br/><br/>Thematic richness is another strength of ""The Fault in Our Stars."" It's an emotionally deep and resonant film just in the way it handles cancer, but it also presents difficult concepts and subplots that even further inform the core story. When Gus uses his ""Make-a-Wish"" to take Hazel to Amsterdam to meet with the author of her favorite book, this seemingly tangential segment in their larger journey brings a surprising number of new layers and ideas to the story, including the author's unexpected reaction and a visit to the Anne Frank House.<br/><br/>""The Fault in Our Stars"" is one of the films changing the way we look at major issues. There's nothing politically charged about cancer, but films wanting to approach anything from race to sexual orientation could certainly adopt some of the techniques here to approach those issues in authentic ways. Teaching tool or not, it's still a quality coming-of-age story right next to ""The Perks of Being A Wallflower.""<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"

","I hesitated for quite a while before watching this movie, exactly because of the great reviews it has been getting and because I have often been let down by highly rated movies. But not by this one. I then hesitated for a while whether I should write a review, as I don't ever do, but I have been so surprised by the mixed reactions to this film, I decided I should.<br/><br/>The script seems to be one of the big deal breakers for those who did not enjoy the film. Sure, I too was at first put off by Gus's character and I questioned the likelihood of the debacle with the author. However, I do not feel the film can be said to have a ""nonsense, unrealistic script"".<br/><br/>No part of this movie can or should be taken out of the context of the fact that it deals with terminally sick teenagers, who are played I think very, very well by Shailene and Ansel. Their sickness is an integral part of their lives and so the Anne Frank scene, for example, made complete sense to me, as her story forms in a way the answer that Hazel was looking for. <br/><br/>Cancer is an emotional roller-coaster and that is what the movie gave us: happiness, sadness, laughter, tears and frustration. Sidenote: I lost my mum to cancer when both she and I were still far too young and I can recognize much of her and the course of the illness in this movie, so I can only say I found the movie/storyline realistic and relatable.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can call it a masterpiece, or the best movie in I don't know how many years, but I feel it was truthful. It's not a movie I'll say I enjoyed watching, but I'm damn sure glad I did. It is worth seeing. And it left me, at least, with something to think about."

","I did give this a 10 and here's why. This movie was real, it was not faked and not filled with teenage fluff. It touched me as a mother and a woman. I wanted this girl, who was given a horrible dose of life, to love life. Experience everything that she could and be happy. As a mother I saw what I would want for my daughter. I would want her to love her hardest and die knowing what that felt like. As I woman I want to be loved like she was. This movie spoke on levels that most of us can't comprehend. I have never been so sick that I have had to stay the night in a hospital. I have never had to be rushed to the er by a loved one or have people terrified every time I call their name. The person that this book was based on knew all of those things. She may not have had a teenage romance before she passed but her memory will live on because of who she was. The movie made a point to tell you that this was not an ordinary teenage love story but it was an exceptional one. I hope when you decide to watch this movie you go in ready to let go of what you know about people and clichés and just be a part of Hazel an Gus. Be strong, scared, loving, compassionate and vulnerable. Be so happy you have another day to be great and enjoy it."
"dee.reid","10","0","1","8 December 2014"," A near-perfect ""Fault""
","In our current 2014 Hollywood wasteland of an endless barrage of big-budget superhero movies (of which I'm a sucker for), Hollywood's other big obsession seems to be adaptations of popular teen novels. Earlier this year, I was gosh-wowed by ""The Spectacular Now"" (2013). Now I've just sat down and watched ""The Fault in Our Stars.""<br/><br/>I just needed a break from the big-budget superhero movie hoopla, you know? ""The Fault in Our Stars"" was a perfect distraction until ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014) is released on DVD tomorrow. I've been eager to watch ""The Fault in Our Stars"" for some time now, and let me say that I wasn't disappointed. I knew what the story was about, and wasn't disappointed by the final result. I was thoroughly pleased by this teen love story that like a lot of teen movies of late, invents its own language, lingo, and philosophical outlook on life as it goes along.<br/><br/>Adapted from the book by John Green (which I intend to begin reading later on this afternoon) and admirably directed by Josh Boone, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" tells the story of Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus ""Gus"" Waters (Ansel Elgort), two teenagers who meet in a support group for teen cancer patients. Gus is a survivor fully intent on living a life worth remembering, but Hazel is battling terminal stage IV lung cancer, and knows that her time is finite (after being granted a few extra years via an experimental cancer treatment) - while being cared for by her loving parents Frannie (Laura Dern) and Michael (Sam Trammell). Over time, however, Hazel and Gus develop a close friendship that gradually blossoms into a full-blown romance. And somewhere in there, too, these two also learn to fulfill their greatest dreams and aspirations.<br/><br/>One of the key reasons I was so eager to watch this film is because I have personal experience with the film's subject matter - which is life with cancer: I lost my mother earlier this year to lung cancer, and in the remaining two weeks of her life, which were spent in the hospital, I visited her everyday and in her final moments, I did my best to make it clear to her that she was the greatest mom her only 29-year-old son could ever ask for. This was something I hoped I would not have to deal with until much later on in my life, but you never know what curve-balls the universe is going to throw at you. And I've moved on quite quickly and easily from the grief of having lost her so soon and so suddenly.<br/><br/>Getting back to the film, of all the teen romance novels made into films over the last few years, this is the one that appears to have struck a chord with me the most. I couldn't help but feel that both Hazel and Gus are such strong, positive characters - making the most of whatever time they've got together and having no regrets about anything they do. Shailene Woodley appears to have an amazing future ahead of her in the movies, if only she can get past her persistent casting in adaptations of teen novels. She was quite amazing in this picture, as was her co-star Ansel Elgort, whom I've never heard of before, but he was quite phenomenal in his acting performance here. I admired his upbeat demeanor and humor and the way he was able to keep Hazel on her toes constantly during the course of their romance. But like life, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" throws us a curve-ball an hour-and-a-half into the picture.<br/><br/>I knew that this movie was going to end the way that it did, but I was not expecting the curve-ball it does end up throwing at us - it's something that truly catches you off-guard and comes straight out of left field, and makes you think about the special kind of cruelty that's dealt by the stars to some people in this life. But what's most admirable here is the way the two teens deal with it, with hope and humor - rather than gloom and despair.<br/><br/>I'm glad that I had the chance to watch ""The Fault in Our Stars."" I'm sure I'm going to love John Green's book. Right now, I'm listening to the soundtrack, which is also worthy of special mention here. I'm not a fan of any of the artists on it - it's largely, mostly a mix of indie musicians I've never heard of (with the sole exception of Charli XCX and her song ""Boom Clap,"" which I honestly can't stop playing) - but it fits the film perfectly. Many of the songs came from Josh Boone's personal music collection (while others made themselves known over the course of the film's editing process), and I can find no fault with his choices. It's equally as amazing as the film that inspired them.<br/><br/>Keep playing Charli XCX's ""Boom Clap"" like there's no tomorrow (which is what I'm doing)!!!<br/><br/>10/10"

"Vartiainen","Null","0","1","29 November 2014"," Bittersweet and darkly humorous love story
","I have not in fact read the book, so this review is based solely on the merits of the film on its own. And I gotta admit, it's a fine movie. Sure the whole message of the film is a touch convoluted as it all starts with the whole speech about how this is not some overly romantic love story coated in saccharine. And yet it kind of is, at least it starts to be as soon as we meet Augustus (Ansel Elgort), one of the savviest, most perfect 18-year-olds ever seen in cinema. And yet that dichotomy doesn't really bother me, because teenagers do that. They think their sufferance is special, unique, and they draw strength from that. It feels real that way.<br/><br/>As a whole this is one of the most touching love stories I've seen in a while. A lot of that is due to the phenomenal chemistry between Elgort and Shailene Woodley, playing the main character Hazel. You totally buy that these teens are in love and the movie wastes no time in getting them together, starting the saccharine. In some movies this would be rather Disney-esque, but here it seems more like a stylistic choice. Like they wanted to focus on the actual relationship instead of how it started. And that relationship is very fine. Full of sarcastic humour, snarkiness, tenderness and some really good conversations, it's a romance you won't get tired of watching, no matter your age or gender.<br/><br/>The script is also very well paced, the rest of the cast is equally talented, the story contains enough joy and sorrow to reach you and as a whole it's a pleasant way to spend an evening. Definitely recommended for all. And now I kind of have to read the book as well."

The 2+ hour movie traverses through the graphs of emotional lows and occasional highs in their lives, or probably the efforts made by them, their parents and friends to create those highs, moves us inside out. It is also about the very sensitive element of parenting the kids with such diseases and dealing with very delicate mindset of such kids. It's also about the caring, the enthusiasm, and the determination to realize self and others dreams during the curtailed span of life. <br/><br/>BFB (Bang For the Buck): A very apt title. Both the leads were played by very young actors Shailene Woodley (Haze) and Ansel Elgort (Gus). While Shailene has potential to become the next Jodi Foster or Sandra Bullock, Ansel definitely is the next Leonardo DiCaprio. Even after knowing the movie consists of some traumatic situations, you'd watch it for their outstanding performances, and for occasional lighter and humorous moments, for their funny friend Isaac (played by Nat Wolf) and a cameo by none other than William Dafoe.

They weren't together for so long, and the little fight/argument that they had about Gus being famous and all was enough.<br/><br/>I liked the stars references too. The text messages would pop star- shaped.<br/><br/>The speeches/eulogies were incredible. <br/><br/>A big part of the film is sad but it's just because it is realistic. The parents knowing the chances for their daughter, they are on alert every single moment but they give her freedom to enjoy her time, as Gus parents do.<br/><br/>The vulnerability and fears of Gus -the cool guy- felt pretty natural too.<br/><br/>Dafoe was a little more cruel that he had too i think for no reason to treat the couple as he did.<br/><br/>Even that the movie has a runtime of 2+ hours, it fulfills this time with enjoyable moments and good scenes, and i say that because many times i think some movies are longer than they should be.

","The director might be soaring after back to back success. Interestingly, both the films dealt with writers, but the main themes were romance. He's just a two movie old and now the movie goers can expect eagerly for his next venture. This movie was based on the teen novel of the same name about a 16-years-old cancer patient.<br/><br/>Hazel Grace, who is battling between life and death is also a strong fighter against all the odds. When her mother sends her to attend the group therapy she meets Augustus Water, a fellow member. As she is being sarcastic, Waters finds an interesting character in her. A friendship develops and they spend more time together. Even knowing there will no future together, the relationship progress and how everything ends is the rest.<br/><br/>Usually cancer themed movies are called tearjerker films. Surprisingly, this movie's aim was different. Of course emotion strikes, but the story narration and character developments were the basic goal. Three-fourth of the movie was well told story about teen romance. The afterwards account begins with a twist which were portrayed in the usual manner. Like all the movies, kept sentiments in the last part. The last quarter was very predictable, but they avoided cliché as much possible.<br/><br/>''Apparently, the world is not a wish-granting factory.''<br/><br/>The parents' role was kind of mysterious one, that diverts viewer from their anticipation. Interesting it also creates some doubts. Compared to the previous movie 'The Spectacular Now', Shailene Woodley looked completely different. That means the physical transformed to look a perfect 16 year old was amazing. Her performance as well gives an impression that the Hollywood's future Academy award grabbing the female lead is on making. At this rate she can do that like Jennifer Lawrence did.<br/><br/>As for the lead actor, it is a good breakthrough and expecting the same result from his next movie as well. This movie, which runs over a 2 hour was smartly sliced the contents and organized those on the right spots. Many had agreed it was a fine cinema transformation from a book. So you can try this, but be careful because nowadays most of the teens movies are overrated because of the overwhelmed teen audience. The warning meant only for the older people. I'm sure the youngster will love this movie, I mean most of them."

The movie runs for more than two hours but you hardly feel it due to the emotions flowing around. It's a beautiful movie just like the Nicholas Sparks stories that we instantly fall in love with. One of John Green's greatest turned into a movie!"

","The first time I heard of this movie was on the front page of IMDb, where new movies displayed as in a showcase. To be honest, I am not a big fan of sad, romantic movie, so I decide to ignore it. While today I was watching a video clip consisting of footage of billboard top 50 songs, all of a sudden, this song, Boom Clap coming on my screen. It's hard not to be attracted by the music video for some certain reasons. First of all, that singer has a peculiar image; then, I find the song rather catchy. So I watched the whole video for like, twice. And I cried.<br/><br/>I don't know why this happened. Listening to music was supposed to be amusing, but I just couldn't control myself when I saw two young people hugging and kissing each other wearing a ""I am in love"" expression that can literally drown you in their face. The second I saw the smile on their face, puddles of tears coming out of my eyes, and by that time I don't even know any plots of the movie. Just few seconds and couple of scenes in this film can make me act like this. I'd better see what the entire movie can do. <br/><br/>The result is just as what I have expected. I cried. I cried so hard that my dad thought I was having problem with my upcoming test. I haven't cried so hard for a movie, or anything, for years.(The last time I did this was when I watching Hachi as I remembered).<br/><br/>People all tend to be moved by strong and beautiful love. No matter what kind of love it is. Sometimes it is the love between families, like Hazel and her parents. Sometimes it is the romantic love that Hazel and Gus shared. Frankly, I don't buy things like true love. However this movie, one of the saddest one that I have ever seen, really helped me regained the faith for finding a person who is there for you, who can give you the best love ever, the love you never ever dreamed of before, the love and forever that only happened once in your life within the numbered days. It's the shield for you to fight while it hurts you with every breath you take. As it said in the book:"" Pain demands to be felt."" <br/><br/>""I am in love with you. And I know that love is just a shout into the void, and that oblivion is inevitable, and that we're all doomed. And that one day all our labor will be returned to dust. And I know that the sun will swallow the only earth we will ever have. And I am in love with you."" <br/><br/>I bet I would cry every time I watch this movie."

","Someone did a great job over this film. Emotions, emotions and emotions. It's hard NOT to get sensitive, which is the whole point.<br/><br/>It represents people dealing with serious illness and the audience tries to feel the way they do. I think the actors are just perfect for both main characters. They did a great job as their feelings were so believable. The story line was very interesting as it's completely different perspective of an illness than the way it's usually presented.<br/><br/>The love story element of the film, brings the idea of appreciating the people that are close to us as you never know when it's time to say goodbye. In addition to this, this also gives hope to those who are seriously ill for love and to try new things even though the diagnosis is clear.<br/><br/>The cinematography and sound in this film is great and it really appeals to the storyline as well as suits both characters in terms of their personal thoughts. <br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a very positive film to watch even though it's mainly about cancer. It tries to give hope and remind us that love is the most important aspect of our lives, and this is what makes each individual full of optimism and happiness."

","The fault in our stars plot is widely known to everyone whether they have seen the movie or read the book. Having read the book a year ago I was prepared for the story, but still had forgotten enough since reading to make some of it still a surprise to me. I enjoyed traits of some of the characters ie van houten but found most of the characters a bit thin with not many layers. However, this movie does describe the idea and feelings surrounding death and illness unlike any other media I have seen before which is extremely liberating. The character choice was spot on, being practically what I remember imagining while reading it. Augustus's monologues are brilliant and his and hazels relationship is truly touching. Very good movie, heartbreaking moments with some beautiful words and friendships, but at the end of the day who doesn't like a dose of lovey cheesy moments."

","Ratings actually do not tell us the reality about a movie or a show and then they are subjective. To me The BraveHeart is the Greatest ever movie and I really liked Robin Hood(Starring Rusell Crowe) but the film has been bashed all over the internet especially here on IMDb and further more Robin Hood was not a Box Office charmer also, So what all this did not stop me from liking the movie,loving it and time and again watching it. The Fault in our stars is an typical Hollywood romantic flick with not many but 2-3 good emotional scenes (like the one where Gus tells Hazel that his cancer is recurring and they are sitting on a bench in Amsterdam-This scene was actually very good.) May be I had too high expectations from the movie(which I shouldn't have) I'd rate it a generous 6.5 .Though my ratings will hardly matter to it now."

","I want to enter just the words I will keep with me from that film.. A metaphor is what keeps us going, we should care less for oblivion, we should enjoy a days-long eternity, we should daily force hope to be live everywhere inside us. There are no untold stories or unspeakable fate. We 're just experiencing our lifetime scenario. See that great film and you can decipher those words' meaning..... This is a real breadth of life even when the 'expiration' date is reaching out. I haven't read the book yet, I started from the opposite side, watching the film. From the technical viewpoint, is a well directed story keeping up the limits to avoid sadness overflow. The actors were excellent"
"CMTiago","7","0","1","31 October 2014"," Good, but underwhelming
","I must say that The Fault In Our Stars caused a certain feeling on me that I'm not accustomed to, since I'm still trying to figure out my emotional reaction to the film. On one hand, I enjoyed the story and the movie flows in a good way. On the other I feel a little underwhelmed by the effect the movie was trying to convey. Cancer is always a tough subject, especially at a young age as is the case in this movie. In a way, I related to the characters, but didn't care enough to cry at the end. Unfortunately I have experienced one side of this disease, as I saw my Grandfather pass away because of it. Still this personal heartache wasn't enough for me to end up loving the movie.<br/><br/>In terms of execution, I have no complaints, as the movie is expertly directed, written and acted. Shailene Woodley & Ansel Elgort handle their roles in a great manner and make the romance more believable. There has been some Oscar talk for Woodley's performance, and personally I wouldn't mind seeing her nominated.<br/><br/>I guess that by the end of this review, I have decided upon my evaluation of the film. So, in the end, I believe that a movie like The Fault In Our Stars is primarily a ""chick flick"", as its marketing strategy pointed out that. However If you're looking for a good story and may, or may not, have had a personal encounter with cancer, I would most definitely recommend this film. Speaking for myself, I think it's a nice enough movie to feel like you haven't wasted 2 hours of your time, yet ultimately the story failed to fully grab me in a spectacular emotional fashion.<br/><br/>Rating: 7,5/10"
"James_De_Bello","8","0","1","21 October 2014"," 8.5/10
","The Fault in our stars has its stumbles and problems, but most importantly it is a movie that will speak to each one of its viewers in a very personal way and by doing so it will produce very different opinions. This is due to the fact that the film treats its material in a unique way and, to the movie's merit, it has the balls to say this is the way we're going and we're sticking hard to it, by doing so the experience that everyone will take out of it will be very subjective. Because of this I feel it is very hard to talk about this movie looking at it soley as an art piece; it touches thematics that are close to every human being and comes out victorious in its intent to offer a prospective from which each one of us can take what he or she wants and think about it. Meaning that as much as the film can be liked or not, I contend that every judgment will be surely influenced by the relation that the viewer had with the film's tone and the themes involved: so if you were able to take something special out of it you will probably see the whole picture on a positive light, if instead you didn't feel in anyway moved or interested you'll probably see it on a total different light. Yet this isn't due, in my opinion, to the fact that the movie is good or bad, but it is because it has its way of going and you will be either in, out or mildly in on it, however I invite you not to blame this on the artistry and to value the filmaking craft on a different level: this doesn't mean that you must like the movie, but only that I see two sides of judging it here and I don't feel like they should be mixed.<br/><br/>Regarding the movie's treatment of its story, I believe that The Fault in our Stars had the potential to reach the greatness of its similar ""50/50"" but comes a bit short in that. It most certainly touches equal emotional heights and curiously it touches them more frequently, but, other than banally having singular moments that will plainly take you out of it (yet they don't count too much), it has a subtle convenience about itself and tends to privilege sentimental storytelling over realistic storytelling. I am not against ""sentimental storytelling"", everybody needs and loves believing in the fantastic: reason why the movie doesn't fail by being sentimental, but it clearly isn't what the film was going for, that being more realism. I didn't feel comfortable one-hundred-percent in being carried away by the narrative in the first 45 minutes and this is probably due to Gus' character (not the performance!), it didn't feel safe for me to give the story my suspension of disbelief in the start, I truly believe this was the script's fault, yet most thankfully after the first act and a half this problem quickly dissolved and boy was I on board from there onwards! The narrative had its problem, but from the tone and the treatment-of-material perspective I was totally in. The film has a very wide array of themes: family, love, friendship, disease, death; it could have failed so badly in its intent to touch on all of those, yet the balance of every element inserted both in drama and comedy was astonishing. The movie made me both laugh and cry multiple times, it is so gut-wrenching yet never stumbles in melodramatic or pretentious territory and manages to maintain a very noble intention and heart. This culminates in the last 30 minutes which touch amazing dramatic heights and had a true impact on me. Hats off to all of the actors that all had their moment to shine and did so, still maintaining a solid quality throughout despite some characters feeling somewhere and somehow unconvincing. Yet this didn't really matter on the whole because I found myself truly caring for everything and everyone and being involved, connected and sometimes reflected by the people portrayed. Josh Boone surely deserves lots of merit for the success of the movie: his direction is very, very solid and keeps everything going without having any really important stumbles.<br/><br/>Yet nothing and nobody deserves the praise that Shailene Woodley deserves here. I can now salefy say that she is the best actress working today alongside Jessica Chastain. I will also go as far as saying that this performance is Oscar worthy. I truly don't have many words that can explain how much I loved this performance. I might as well go on and just write a love letter to her instead of describing how wonderfully awed I felt by her. Frame after frame all I could think of was just how dam spectacular she was. She is the reason this movie succeeds in every single aspect. Without a performance of this caliber you would have half if not less of a movie. I don't know how to put in words how much I was riveted by this particular performance, I knew she was totally brilliant before, but this really was powerful. I actually came as far as thinking that Shailene Woodley would really die (it's no spoiler, we all know Haezel has terminal cancer) because of how convincing she was in the role. I have rarely ever been affected so deeply by an actor's craft and as superficial as it might sound I am honestly saying what I really thought. Thank you Shailene for your acting talent, this is the reason I love going to the cinema.<br/><br/>In the end ""The Fault in our Stars"" hit the right buttons for me and resonated on multiple levels. Plus it had very deep emotional affection and in spite of its many minor incoherences I found myself totally won over, this is one of the best of the year."

","The Fault In Our Stars tells the story of two kids, who are both recovering from cancer, falling in love. This could have so easily become a cheesy, sentimental tearjerker like so many other movies featuring love and disease, but the way the story is told is beautiful. <br/><br/>It is actually a very adult movie, it's smart, funny and sad. The script flaws effortless and leads you inside their story and the people around them. All dealing with the aftermath of their disease in their own way. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort have a great chemistry together and they deliver every line perfectly. (Well, maybe only the sentence about the Dragon Carrot Risotto being human, that was a weird one, and Ansel Elgort clearly had a problem with it.) They stay far away from being pathetic victims, and give many layers to their characters. <br/><br/>Also the supporting cast is making this story really work, especially Laura Dern as the caring, sensitive mother and Nat Wolff, who gives a great comic performance as the best friend of Gus. The cinematography is beautiful. For instance: I love my hometown Amsterdam, and they did a great job showing the beauty of it. This is the Amsterdam I know so well and love so much.<br/><br/>And of course the scriptwriters and the director did a fabulous job with this movie. It's not a cheesy, sentimental tearjerker: but man – did I cry! I don't know the book, and I don't think I ever will. And I don't care.

","Watching 'The Fault in Our Stars' I noticed that I had experienced many emotions throughout the movie. After every upsetting scene you think it'll be over, however it gets worse. In the scene where Hazel-Grace (Shailene Woodley) is lying in bed asleep, she gets woken up by her lungs failing her, this is because she is suffering with thyroid cancer that has spread to her lungs. She gets rushed to the hospital and wakes up in the ICU alone. She is then told that she doesn't have a brain tumour but her lungs had filled up with a fluid and they had to be drained. Augustus (Ansel Elgort) is waiting for her; however Hazel does not want to see him. This is a heart- breaking, waterworks scene because of her rejection towards Augustus and her almost dying. The actors and actresses are a perfect fit for the type of film, because I read the book and pictured how they would look by the way John Green described them to be. Shailene Woodley is a strong and talented actress, you can see many emotions she has expressed in the film from her disease, and however the love that Hazel and Gus share is unbreakable. Where the film is based on a true story it does mean a lot more to the audience as this is what does happen, it's not just some other love story, it's a life story. I recommend seeing this film, as it does match the essence of the book."

I just like how it's true to show that pain is really an ugly feeling but it can make you feel stronger every time you surpass those excruciating moments in your life. Although it is based from the book I must say that the movie is great. I haven't read the book but I guess the movie made justice to the book. I never liked reading books until Just recently I started to read a fiction novel and I'm liking it. And I might read TFIOS book too because of this movie.

","I found this one on DVD from my local public library. It is a good movie, although it has a few too many very slow-moving scenes. It deals with teenagers with illnesses that will likely take their lives all too soon.<br/><br/>I became a fan of young Shailene Woodley when she was the lead in that teenage TV series in 2008. She is a very pretty girl who also looks very innocent. While she might not have looked ""rough"" enough for the role in ""Divergent"", here she is perfect as Hazel who has been fighting a type of cancer and weakened lungs. So much so that she has an oxygen machine with her everywhere.<br/><br/>Young actor Ansel Elgort is an interesting pick for her love interest. In their last movie he and Woodley had the role of siblings in ""Divergent"". Here he is Gus, a cancer survivor with an artificial right leg. Hazel and Gus met at a support group meeting.<br/><br/>The focus of the story is Hazel's, seeming to accept her fate and not understand all the fuss everyone else is making, particularly her parents, Laura Dern as Frannie and Sam Trammell as Michael. But her meeting Gus causes her hope for the first time, he falls in love with her and she eventually with him, even as she does not understand why.<br/><br/>An interesting development involves Willem Dafoe as Van Houten, Hazel's favorite author.

","I'd hardly know where to start without giving away spoilers. Even after this long there are those who have not seen the movie ... or read the book. The film does a marvelous job of bringing the book to the screen with its themes and viewpoint intact. For that the filmmakers deserve much praise. The production values were high, the direction tight and on target and the locations, sets and music complimented rather than distracted. It goes without saying that the acting was talented and spot on. To begin, I especially liked Laura Dern. She's always good but I especially enjoyed her here. She reminded me exactly of some of the cancer mothers I've known and she did it with dignity and grace. Thank you Ms. Dern. I can't comment on the part played by Sam Trammel. I can't because his character is me. I should mention that unfortunately, for me, this subject matter was a bit too close to home. Once you've been down this road the world can never look the same again. That has to bring me to Hazel Grace; and the young talent who played her: Shailene Woodely. Ms. Woodley gave beauty, sensitivity, dignity and grace to the most difficult of characters. I could give in to my ceaseless grief and anxiety and say something mean-spirited about her performance because; after all, she's actually healthy and strong and is likely destined for a long, happy and successful life. How could she possibly begin to grasp the gravity of her character and the all-to-real physical pain and mental anguish that her character had to live with every second of her life? But, to her great credit, she pulled it off. At least she did for this film-goer and that's enough of an accomplishment for her young life. I'm glad I didn't have to cut her any slack; she had that line as taunt as it could be. The real question left for this film then, is if they did right by all of the very real Hazel's and Gus' out there. In the final analysis they did as much as could be covered in the short flash of time that is a film. It's perhaps all most audiences could take as well. It was very hard for me to sit through as it was. Had they struck a mark any closer to the source I don't think I could have lasted the film. My own family's experience was far worse than this. My oldest daughter had a brain tumor, the same kind as John Travolta's character in ""Phenomenon"". I guess that's ironic in some way. The only good thing I can say about that is that she very quickly lost the ability to understand what was happening to her. Another irony is that patients like her were mentioned in the book this film was adapted from. It said, ""... Her brain cancer was of the variety that makes you not you before it makes you not alive."" That was the sole blessing in it; a perverse kind of mercy. But enough about me. See the movie. It's bound to give something to each one who sees it. If it does, do yourself a favor and read the book. It is better than the film ... all books are."

","This is the first review I have ever written, and I thought this film was enough to make that change. I have read 'the fault in our stars' book, it blew my mind. I was sceptical about the film whether it would ruin it for me and how the book touched me, but I was wrong. This film physically made my heart hurt, it was utterly beautiful. I think the actors were perfect for this film, it was hardly altered from the book so it did not ruin it. I'm a hopeless romantic any day of the week, but this film is more of a reality to the perfect love which is even better for any romantic out there. I have personally lost many family members to cancer, and even though the medical terms are fictional, the relationships, the heart break the day to day suffering is real. So for me this film did it all, its powerful, it's beautiful and most of all its touching. For anyone wanting that perfect heart warming,but heart wrenching film all at the same time this is a must watch."

","I really liked '' The Fault in our stars''. its more than just a 2 hour time you spend watching, in fact it is a whole life experience summoned up in the movie. the whole scheme is so uplifting even it is hard to resist crying in some scenes. the main points I think it caught my attention are the following :<br/><br/>1. When Hazel replied to Gus in the support group when he said that his greatest fear was oblivion to tell him that all people is going to die someday and no one will remember Cleopatra or Mozart... really tells you how she not even think the way most of dreamers do and that she is humble minded yet so wise to know that difference.<br/><br/>2. The restaurant act in Amsterdam shows the very opposite yet corresponding way the couple think.. like they close their circle together, they complete each other ...He would believe in afterlife because it's the point of all this life,thats how he proved his belief towards what happens when u die and life ends.. on the contrary she always asks why should even be a point of life ..why should it be linked to a truth anchor to tell you how you did back when you was alive.<br/><br/>3. when they met with Van Houten and he told Hazel that she is childish wanting to know what will happen next is really the best way to show that those sick ''children'' in front of him are only physically sick but their minds are not ..on the contrary he us healthy but with sick mind..indicates that those sick dreamers won't live along us for a long time because they are so pure and heavenly fiction minded that the writer of the novel himself can't find the end of an importance.''maybe because it's his daughter also''.<br/><br/>4.the way Gus keeps pushing Hazel forward seems like she is going to die and his lost leg is not an issue as her lungs thing..sooner you realize that he is the doomed one and she is way too healthy compared to him.<br/><br/>5. the paradigm shift Gus has realized that you should be remembered and loved by only one not millions ..but deeply not widely ... so he learned his life assignment and knew she was right from the very beginning. That explains why he already died. <br/><br/>It is a life changing movie that can replace so much pain and experiences by just realizing the very simple fact: Yes you should be remembered , but only by the ones who you love. not millions because after all, we are doomed."

I just want to say that I think these are the kind of stories that should be enforced, not revoked. This movie is captivating in that you want to just watch, but instead you're held closely, cozy in the web. It's riveting, because it's so simple but induces your conscious. The grade was peaceful, the dialogue was written for the story, not the moment. This movie just does it for me. I'm not good with descriptions, but this story is told very naturally, and I think it's best had on a nice winter night by a fireplace, with a window cracked.

","Plot<br/><br/>Hazel (Shailene Woodley) has cancer and may die of it. The prospects don't look great. Her mother (Laura Dern) is worried about her and thinks she is depressed because she keeps rereading the same book so she instructs Hazel to go to a cancer support group. During the course of a meeting she is introduced to Gus (Ansel Elgort) and Isaac (Nat Wolff). Gus makes a pass at Hazel who looked intrigued by the offer, but not all together moved by it. Slowly Gus is successful in winning Hazel's affections after agreeing to read her favorite book. It is after this time when Hazel confides in Gus that she tried to contact the author and was unable to get a reply. Later when Gus tries contacting the author he gets an invitation to meet the author himself at his home in Amsterdam. Hazel is delighted in having the opportunity to talk to her beloved author in person and discuss what happened to the characters in the story she was reading after the book was finished. Only she doesn't know if she can make the trip because her doctors told her she is too sick to go and her mom told her they might not be able to afford it.<br/><br/>Character Development<br/><br/>The impressive trend of this film is that the whole cast goes through a transformation of one kind or another and unlike a great many films, this film's time-line leaves room for that to happen. The two leads spend much of the screen time with one another and slowly build a relationship. An interesting element of the storytelling involves superimposing text-ting messages and emails onto the screen instead of having the audience read over someone's shoulder. And then there was a tender moment when the couple picked one special word they would use to signify their love.<br/><br/>Acting<br/><br/>Impressive acting all around, though Nat Wolff's character was at times very irritating, but I don't know how much of it is the actor's fault and how much of that is the writing. I think it could swing either way; most likely something that the director (Josh Boone) could have squared away if he had the means. I also thought that Sam Trammell's character was underutilized, but that would be another problem with the writing. He had a couple poignant little scenes, only it wasn't much. He was left behind a great deal of the way. Willem Dafoe was another actor that was underutilized, though that had to do with the fact that he was given a small role. I know it is said that there are no small roles, only small actors; yet the honest truth is that he had a small role and he did the best with it that he could and he did show some growth.<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>There are a few unforeseen twists along the way that keeps this rather weepy tale from getting stale and they all work within the logic framework of the story and are quite clever in their design. Nothing can be taken for granted here and about anything could happen. One thread of the story goes one way and just when you think it has run its course it continues along the same path in the next scene. Generally I was entertained for the most part, yet there were moments and some unpleasant stretches of time that began to lull a bit too much or irritate. I could definitely notice this awkwardness because when things began to fall into place in the end and I could feel the difference in the storytelling. The energy was palpable when they made the effort."

","In what some may call the tear-jerking film of the summer based off of the best selling novel The Fault In Our Stars, Hazel Grace (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus (Ansel Elgort) take us along side them as they endure their emotional and heartbreaking journey. Hazel, who's history of cancer has left her lungs weak, now supports a new fashion accessory of an oxygen tank; much like Augustus's, prosthetic leg he was given from his cancer. When the two young and naive cancer patients meet at their weekly support groups, Augustus instantaneously falls in love with the sarcastic and smart ass character played by Woodley. The writers do an amazing job of making the audience connect with the movies in more ways than one. <br/><br/>This unconventional love story portrayed by these two characters is one that is unfamiliar to this genre of movies. Completely original and dramatically unlike any other love story, it leaves you fighting back tears one moment while suffering from a gut-wrenching laugh in the next; all the while feeling the same pain that the characters on the screen display. When Hazel suffers from taking on a flight of stairs, you see the pain and struggle within her, while seeing the love Augustus has for her as he stands by her side. It is truly interactive in the sense that these actors have done such an extraordinary job in making the audience experience the aura and ambiance this film gives off. <br/><br/>The actors behind the screen play a huge role in why you may find yourself relating the story to your own life as well. Perhaps the circumstances are not as severe; but the principal of being able to fight for yourself and the ones you love is not a foreign idea. The way Woodley plays Hazel so naturally and effortlessly in the film, makes her engaging. Us as an audience automatically are overcome with empathy and sympathy. Elgort plays the approachable and charismatic Augustus and he undoubtedly does the character justice. He draws you in with his clever wittiness and his ironic comments, such as, "" Hazel Grace, it'd be a privileged to have my heart broken by you"", while maintaining the image of prince charming. What girl wouldn't want to hear that, right?<br/><br/>The script that was made for this movie is one that cannot be matched. Some may be hesitant on seeing the movie because they may have fallen in love the book so much, but surprisingly it pulls the lively and alluring chapters directly off the page and on to the big screen. To be able to match the tone and atmosphere of a novel in its follow up film is something remarkable and very hard to accomplish. The amount of voice and detail that was put into the script is something that should not go unnoticed. <br/><br/>I applaud the writes, actors, editors and directors of this film because it was truly one to remember. They allowed us to step inside the movie along with them and fully connect with every scene. It truly is an eye opener and makes the audience wonder about many things. As Augustus says, ""You don't get to say if you get hurt in this worldbut you do have some say in who hurts you."""
"l_rawjalaurence","9","0","2","23 September 2014"," Groundbreaking Study of the Experience of Cancer
","FAULT IN OUR STARS is a quite remarkable film, if only for the stunning performances of Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort in the leading roles as two teenagers suffering from terminal cancer. There might have been a temptation to sentimentalize this story in the manner of LOVE STORY (1972), but director Josh Boone manages to create instead a story of remarkable poignancy while remaining aware of just how destructive the awareness that one has cancer can be. <br/><br/>It's often difficult to explain to non-sufferers the effects of cancer, not only physically but emotionally. Despite the well- meaning intentions of her parents (Laura Dern, Sam Trammell), Hazel (Woodley) cannot really communicate her true feelings to them. She is not simply an ""Ugly Duckling"" whose illness renders her somehow 'different' from her classmates; she is a living, breathing person who wants to be regarded just like anyone else. The fact that she has an illness is irrelevant; in the limited time she has available, she wants to live life to the full. This is precisely what Gus (Elgort) and fellow cancer-sufferer Isaac (Nat Wolff) understand, and hence the three of them become almost inseparable. When Hazel and Gus are together, they not only gain strength from one another but learn how to treat the world on their own terms, and not necessarily listen to their parents. Boone's handling of these sequences is quite brilliant, especially the sequence where the two teenagers hug and kiss in bed.<br/><br/>In the end, however, the realities of cancer leads to a sad ending; but is it really 'sad'? According to a non-cancer suffer, it might be considered as such, but to Hazel it represents something else, something intangible. She might experience severe emotional distress, but that experience gives her a renewed faith in life. Cancer requires people to rethink their lives and try to approach each day in different ways, to reconstruct themselves and to become more mindful of the world around them. This is what Hazel manages to do, which is why we feel so supportive of her.<br/><br/>FAULT IN OUR STARS is perhaps the first movie I have seen to approach the experience of cancer in a way that non-cancer suffers might understand. It is a groundbreaking piece; if it could be shown to anyone and everyone who has encountered the disease, it might change their lives for the better."

","Firstly, I am not one to EVER right a review for a movie so me actually doing this is sort of a big deal. Before this movie, I thought it was going to be one of those teenage love stories that are usually an epic fail, but I was wrong. This movie was a lot more than a love story. It was a true outlook on how cancer can play its scary role in a teenagers life. Hazel and Augustus did so much more than show me a short but amazing love story. Hazel despite her illness, was still a normal teenager. And that Augustus, he was everything but normal. These two have really inspired me and touched my heart. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a different view of life because it sure changed mine. It wasn't hard to rate this movie a 10. And just a tip, make sure you have a box of tissues near you. Trust me, you'll need them."
"konix","8","0","1","22 September 2014"," A wonderful movie about the power of love and value of life
","(contains spoilers)<br/><br/>Is life worth living even when we know death is around the corner? Does life need to have a transcendental meaning to be meaningful?<br/><br/>The wonderful motion picture ""The Fault in our Stars"" attempts to answer these timeless questions by focusing on the love story of two terminally ill teenagers.<br/><br/>Teenage love should be filled with the joy and exhilaration of knowing that the best days of your life are ahead of you: never-ending romantic evenings, marriage, parenthood and aging in the comfort and warmth of each other's care. It should not come with a time bomb that says that all of a sudden either you or your lover will die at a few hours notice.<br/><br/>In the case of Hazel and Augustus, madly in love yet hopelessly ill with cancer, the question is: why should they invest in their relationship if they live on borrowed time? Heck, why should they really invest in anything at all? The more they attach to life, the harder it becomes to let go of it.<br/><br/>Augustus is obsessed with leaving a legacy, with being remembered through the annals of history. Hazel isn't able to engage whole-heartedly in any activity and spends each day simply going through the motions. As she puts it at the beginning of the movie, ""depression is not a side effect of cancer; it's a side effect of dying"".<br/><br/>By finding each other, the two teens discover that love can bring meaning to both of their lives, no matter how short-lived. Augustus understands that he doesn't have to be a Mozart or an Einstein to have a life worth living that doesn't need make his mark on all humanity to feel fulfilled: his legacy will be treasured by Hazel, by his friends and his family, that's all that matters. On her part, Hazel discovers that love can fill even even the shortest life with meaning and can make every last minute worth living.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with memorable, amazingly touching scenes. Perhaps the one that resonated with me the most is the romantic, five-star dinner in Amsterdam, complete with bottles of champaign and the chef's full selection of delicacies. Hazel and Augustus savored every last bite, every last drop of champagne and every last instant of each other's company. For one night they forgot their existential plight; for one night they were able not to think about what awaits them around the corner, about never being able to fulfill their dreams of being a ""normal"" young couple. What is so touching is that their tragic circumstances forced them to grow up very quickly, to go through the various phases of their relationship in fast-forward mode. You usually don't have a candlelight dinner at sixteen, in a dark suit/long gown, overflowing with champagne; but then again, you are not supposed to be terminally ill at sixteen either.<br/><br/>The message is inescapable, and I think the analogy with Ann Frank's death – which the movie pointedly makes – is not far fetched: Ann was able to find love and beauty up until the moment she died; Hazel and Augustus had that same strength.<br/><br/>Hopefully, we too can abandon our own delusions of leaving a legacy of some consequence to humanity and focus instead on leaving a tiny – yet infinite – legacy to those that really matter in our life, however few; hopefully we too can learn to appreciate every minute of our life, however inconsequential and ephemeral.<br/><br/>Two quotes come to mind: ""for the world you may be nothing, but for someone you are the world"" (anonymous); ""It is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual than to labor diligently for the salvation of the masses"" (Dag Hammarskjold)."

","The Fault In Our Stars stuck in my sights since the huge success of book. I could see it everywhere I go and I love bookshops. Frankly, book cover is truly original and catchy. But I'm not really into these teenage dramas and never read it. However, I did consider watching film because of two leads: talented and beautiful Shailene Woodley and newcomer Ansel Elgort.<br/><br/>Golden Globe nominee Woodley (The Descendants) plays a girl, Hazel Grace Lancaster, with thyroid cancer, who's been diagnosed of disease in early age and since then her life mostly happens in between home, hospital and support groups. While Elgort's character, Gus, is an ex basketball player, cancer survivor with an amputee leg. As they meet at the most boring support group meeting, their friendship gets a weird and interesting start that turns into unconditional love (whatever it is). Even from the very beginning we all know that this is not going to work, because any of them can just die and leave another behind. Gus and Hazel knowing this are truly having the moments of their lives, making all their dreams come true, which includes trip to Amsterdam - a place where the author of Hazel's favorite book lives.<br/><br/>The Fault In Our Stars is a pleasant movie to watch and mostly because of main characters and actors. Hazel Grace and Gus are the most real people among other hundreds of teenage dramas. They are real with their problems, personalities, aspirations, the way they love, etc. Shailene and Ansel manage to just fit the bones of this couple and turn their personalities inside out - making them easy to read, understand. However, good parts of writing does not go further, since the rest of story is just another A Walk to Remember. Hence, it does not bring much new to the table. The end is predictable, it says nothing new.<br/><br/>I'd say Shailene Woodley's performance is surprisingly good. Surprisingly because The Fault In Our Stars does not seem one of those movies with brilliant acting. But she makes her character so nice, so good to know, so perfect to watch, that I can not resist thinking that Shailene actually was great here. Hazel Grace has some emotional breaks, a lot cries, drama, fun, laughs and Woodley deals with this huge palette of emotions quite impressively. <br/><br/>Ansel Elgort's portrayal of her sweet, gentlemen boyfriend is no less good. He, to the contrary, is more fun, not dramatic, easy going.<br/><br/>Since, The Fault In Our Stars fails to deliver something new, extraordinary or refreshing, it's a nice one time watch film, with impressive performances that is not going to be remembered too long."

Their chemistry is something special and they absolutely lift this movie up on their shoulders and carry it. The supporting cast is also strong, particularly Laura Dern.<br/><br/>Manipulative? Sure.

","The Fault In Our Stars was good. It was well acted, good story, very sad and moving at times. I fully expected (and maybe looked forward to) blubbering my way through it watching star-crossed terminally ill teenagers falling in love. I expected it to really impress me after If I Stay barely failed to impress me. The problem with The Fault In Our Stars is that I waited so long to see it and people talked endlessly about it. I knew every detail and people emphasized how sad it was and the characters and the book and you just heard about it constantly since the day it released in theatres. So by the time I finally sat down to watch it, it felt like I had almost been there and seen it. It was sad but maybe because the expectations is that it was desperately, soul wrenching sad that it underwhelmed me. In fact, for a story that seems to be very, very popular we have seen all of this before haven't we? This is not a new concept. Love Story? A Walk To Remember?...even The Notebook in some respects. Two young people inadvertently meet, he is the pinnacle of manhood and she is this adorable young, naive but sexy young girl and death will tear them apart. It is intense and the film is indubitably sad. Right from the opening monologue you know this isn't going to be a happy story.<br/><br/>It appears as though Shailene Woodley is becoming an ""It"" girl in Hollywood and I can understand why. I don't necessarily think shes an amazing actress but she has a very down to earth quality and her performances are solid and you relate to her. She's very ""girl next door"" in all the right ways and for this role that is nearly perfect. She draws you into her world and you feel everything she does. Ansel Elgort is very similar. I don't necessarily think he'll ever win any Oscars but he is insatiably fun in the movie. You instantly understand her attraction to him and he's genuine and free spirited and teaches her about life. The two of them together are excellent. The key to a film like this is passion and chemistry and they've got it pretty good. It isn't amazing but its solid. Laura Dern and Sam Trammell are good but underused as Woodley's parents. I think I would have liked to have seen more interaction between Woodley and them in regards to her own illness. Both are good actors. A surprise cameo and a great addition is that of Willem Dafoe as an angry writer who Woodley idolizes until discovering how full of hate he is. Dafoe really stands out being such a near-legend in his own right.<br/><br/>I hate to be so pessimistic but I can't help but feel The Fault In Our Stars is one of those movies that everybody loves because everybody loves it. It happens to be the latest ""fad."" I feel that its actually not really age appropriate for its intended audience but I get that Teens now are a lot more intense than they once were. For this to have such a high score on IMDb doesn't make sense to me. It is a GOOD movie but it is far from a GREAT movie. Its tried and true material done again in a decent way with a decent cast and no more or less. Josh Boone who directs has very little big screen experience but that being said he does a very good job and I'm certain his career will skyrocket after this. So look at it this way...teens are in love with this right now because everyone is talking about it. If you have seen your fair share of romances you will enjoy it and much like me you'll think...oh that was sad and cute...but memorable? Hardly. Just a good movie to entertain. 7.5/10"

The suspension of disbelieve kicks in early and you are transported to the world of Hazel and Gus hopelessly. I am one of those who has read the book and I had great expectations from the movie. I was a relieved man that the movie did justice to my imagination.<br/><br/>There are few reasons why the viewer will watch the movie till the end. One, it's smart. The conversations between Hazel, the optimist who wants to leave a mark in the world and Hazel, the pessimist who believes that everything finally ends in an oblivion has the right formula for some very fresh rhetoric.<br/><br/>Two, even if it'a pathetically sad movie, the characters who are suffering in it do not indulge in self pity. They are unabashed about their illness and they also find room for humor. <br/><br/>Three, it has a positive message saying that life is made out of small and big infinities. Hazel is grateful to Gus for giving her their small infinity.

","I've seen many films, but don't write reviews nor have I got the literary skills to do so, but this one gave me a burning desire to put many words out even though it's hard to find ones that might be sufficient for this epic story. This is just my feelings sorted in the order they pop inside me rather than a review. I don't have to write about all the good writing, acting and performances along with charming set up of deeply sentimental scenes coated with highly emotional songs. These are all obvious, some people would still claim it as a teen movie or another sad love story for a dedicated audience, but truth is I've never come across a fiction that induces such noble thoughts and emotions and never felt such feelings for a fictional character before. Most common way of hypnotism is the state of mind that you are really fascinated and moved to an alternate state of consciousness by something that is made up...and this movie does that. I'm an average man on his late thirties and usually don't cry for a movie nor like sad stories, but also never keep myself from simple pleasure of admitting it..proud to confess bursting into tears on their eulogies which could have been their vows...not just because their limited infinity or the ending that set my soul fire but because how real and how utterly great their love was..and their way of celebrating it..couldn't't't resist to envy...maybe I aspire what I lack in my life but everyone relates to it one way or another...I want my own Hazel Grace...Mesmerized by whole realness of it...<br/><br/>...as for real life I wish for once people would kill bias and consider this as a worthy piece of hypnosis business of motion picture industry. Along with all characters, Hazel Grace was uniquely real and endearing thanks to Shailene Woodley giving her life perfectly...and won't be surprised (rather will find peace) if she or movie gets showered with awards other than reactions of us...Like many, I also had a tendency to save my 10 always for something higher..up until finding myself re-watching it over and over..so yes this is my first ten and I like my choice of Ten!...OKAY."

","Such a deep meaningful movie. It just makes you heart stop every single time and appreciate what you actually have got in this life, how lucky you are to be alive and so many troubles suddenly seems stupid and small, when you understand the beauty of being able to live healthy and full life. So sad story, but, at the same time, so unbelievably beautiful and pure. I normally do not like any types of drama, but this film is now one of my favorites. Thank you so much for this, it really helped me to see so much clearer what is really important in life and give a new perspective on things that happens around me. Thank you, and thanks to the actors for such good performances, you are great!"

","I have watched a lot of movies, a lot.....and this movie is the best ever romantic movie I have ever seen. The cast is just perfect, the chemistry, the emotions all perfect. The pace of the movie is excellent and it all the events which take place are at the right time. <br/><br/>However, the sheer superb performance undoubtedly comes from Shailene Woodley, she is literally head and shoulder above the rest of the cast. Whether it is her acerbic wit, acceptance of her fate, emoting through her eyes, or delivering gut-wrenching moments through emotionally harrowing sequences and monologues, Wodley, quite simply, knocks every scene and dialogue out of the park. <br/><br/>This is an exceptionally young talent and can be easily counted among the decade's best performance from an actress. Shailene Woodley is surely a superstar in the making."

"zhaohan_dong","8","0","1","12 September 2014"," Quite moving story. But somehow with goofs and failure of twists.
","The story of those teenagers just at my age, has taught us a lesson. It's little difficult for me to understand that story fully, since I'm a teenager too, but not a patient of cancer, or at least not diagnosed. Their situation is really hard for me to be fitted in with.<br/><br/>But after reading a few reviews, I get a sense of a larger scale, that I don't need to be with cancer to catch the means behind the shots. That the death might be the best way of being remembered and loved. Gus passed away, as a great boyfriend and a great friend, a lovely son. He left us a handsome figure. His girlfriend, Hazel, remained in love with him, maybe ""always"". For Isaac, though he was not died, he lost his girlfriend Monica, with their ""always"" became a fake. If Isaac died, he could be remembered by Monica forever, be with love until his last day, like Gus.<br/><br/>Another thing is that it's so heart-breaking to expect that someday, your love will die. It's totally different from dying from accidents. You're taking everyday preciously, knowing everyday might be his/her last day. I can't stand that. But that's what they did in the film.<br/><br/>So, now, a little bit of filmmaking. There're a lot of music in the film, some of them are quite well, while others are lack of proper emotions. In the start, the music does a great job of building the atmosphere. But in the end, when Hazel opened the letter from Van Houton, the music gave me a kind of absurdity, not so contemplative as an end of a film.<br/><br/>For their trip to Amsterdam, to me, the plane took off as soon as the flight attendance got away with the Captain's announcement. That's too quickly that hardly no one can get prepared for take off.<br/><br/>And the letter from Van Houton again. He gave Hazel a letter after Gus' Funeral. It seems like the director and the writers tried to present us a strong twist, about the aloofness of Van Houton superficially, and the real means of him. But I didn't cry since I didn't care about his words. Those are trivial to the film, I thought. I haven't read the book yet, so I can't prejudge it's whose fault. But surly, it can be improved for a better film."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""The Fault in Our Stars"" (2014) is simply beautiful picture. Great acting by all involved, and especially by my favorite star of recent years Shailene Woodley this is an involving picture from start till finish. I didn't found it very predictable, sure, if you are watching a lot pictures, you will now where it's coming, but still i was captivated from start till finish. On it's core this is a romantic picture, with unusual characters. This picture is not about cancer either, it's about embracing your life in every step, no mater what - this is i think is a point of this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, flavorless acting especially by both leads (and another standout performance by Shailene Woodley), nice script, refreshing love story and nice drama - this picture is simply a joy to watch, and yes, don't forget to have some handkerchiefs - you will need them, 9/10."

","I am so glad I saw this though it appears to be a tear jerker. Well it may, but it also gives you lots of hope. It flies in all accounts: perfect story, script, casting, acting and inspiration. I cried and laughed and felt satisfied even though I was not sick. <br/><br/>We can learn so much from kids and yet these are not really kids. As young adults they have the purity and positive drive of kids who just live for the present and seize the moment. Yet on the other hand they are about to become adult and have the maturity to love and care for the people they deeply love/look up to/admire. Beautiful story setting. Very realistic and positive outlook for life. Inspirational for all ages and of all conditions. Life maybe short but still good. It is important to vent and have a support system who accepts you as who you are and on your side at all times. <br/><br/>Excellent casting and acting, especially the three youngsters who have to brave cancer. Guz (Ansel Elgort) is so charming with his sincere smile that you just want to hug and kiss him. Hazel (Shailene Woodley) is very cute and sweet and had a great sense of humor. She also displays a strong sense of confidence. Yet when they weep you really feel the ache inside them and cry with them. Even when Issac (Nat Wolff) loses his eye and has to wear sunglasses, his facial expressions made me cry. <br/><br/>But it is not a sad story. Death is all around us. We are all going to die. Yet before that day comes, we have to live well and full and have a good laugh about it. These teenagers with terminal illness show us exactly how to do it. As mentioned in the movie, pain demands to be felt. So is love, sadness, anger and all kinds of emotions because they are what make us human. No need to worry about whether we would be remembered because we would not know then. Let's focus on this life.<br/><br/>Have not seen such a good movie for a long time. I would give it an 8. Really looking forward to read the book."

"amsby17","8","0","1","7 September 2014"," Ultimate tragic romance
","Director Josh Boone took on the challenging and all-too-common theme of young, tragic love with The Fault in Our Stars - so he had better get it right - and he did. In fact, it's refreshingly one of the best if not the best attempt at capturing this difficult and emotionally swept up idea in film. Hats off to stars Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort who add a truly beautiful, touching and sentimental movie to their portfolios. Waterworks guaranteed.<br/><br/>Woodley plays Hazel - a 17 year old girl who's already running on borrowed time. Her devoted parents (Laura Dern and Sam Trammell) try to manage; having dealt with their daughter's illness since she was 13 and their longtime weariness shows empathetically on their faces. Life lacks luster for young Hazel whose situation is pretty grim. Mom and Dad send her to a support group for teens with cancer - and it's there that she catches the eye of Augustus (Ansel Elgort). He's also been struck with an affliction that has taken part of his leg; although when he meets Hazel he is currently in remission. He's adoringly innocent, playful and forever charming - and completely smitten with Hazel. She's cautious per her situation, but ultimately can't help but fall wonderfully head over heels for him. It's the value of this relationship that the characters discover and it's their definition of what makes a significant life that is forever altered.<br/><br/>There are some obvious short-cuts to the audience's heartstrings being used in The Fault in Our Stars - let's not deny that - but it's quickly forgiven in this honest and gut-wrenching romance because it's just done so well. The premise allows the teen coupling to be intensified without making it ridiculous. The character's simple lives transpire to a higher plane with love, and their longing for more of what they just can't get is the ultimate tragic romance."

","I'm 99.9% sure there are no spoilers. But I marked it as such just in case something I said gives something away for you. I tried my best not to give anything away.<br/><br/>I believe that books are better than the movie made for the book. However, this was one of those rare exceptions. The movie was just as great as the book! I do however, have some complaints about them changing who says what or certain things that happened in the book but didn't happen in the movie that should have.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the cast. I am really disappointed that they didn't stay true to Peter Van Houten's appearance as described in the book. But he did stay true to character in many other ways. (This is not a spoiler since he's seen in the trailer). I kind of expected different parents for Augustus though. They were not what I expected but still just as sweet. I only wish they had more screen time. Hazel's parents were the absolute best. You could see the love they had for their daughter and how much they wanted to see her happy. Hazel and Augustus! Oh my gosh. The two actors (actor and actress) seemed to have this amazing chemistry. Sometimes I would forget that it was just a movie and that they were just acting. That's how convincing they were that they were in love. It felt like they were actually together off screen as well. <br/><br/>Due to the amazing cast choice and sticking to the story despite the few changes, this movie receives a 10 out of 10. I absolutely loved the book and I'm so glad the movie was just as good as the book. Since I cried reading the book, I knew I would cry during the movie as well. I was right. I did cry. I cried uncontrollably. It's such a touching story. <br/><br/>I read in the discussion boards that someone felt they romanticized cancer. I don't think that's true at all. I felt the book (and the movie) went into detail about what cancer is really like. The author even did his research to ensure he explained it correctly. The story does however, focus more on the love and friendship between Hazel and Augustus as well as what their lives were like dealing with cancer. Their lives were nowhere near easy. I felt that I had a better understanding (at least a little bit) of what some people with cancer go through. But I do feel like they could have made the effects more visible during the movie just as the book was very descriptive about it.<br/><br/>Like always, I do recommend reading the book first so that you will have a better understanding of the movie. Happy watching movie lovers!"

The acting is so good that you can't omit it without noticing. Shailene Woodley (the girl) is so cute, adorable, you want to hug her and fell in love with her right away! Everything she does feels extremely real and loaded with honest emotions. Ansel Elgort (the boy) is the exact copy but in a male version.

The movie is about a teenage girl Hazel Grace with a terminal cancer and have not much time to live, meets Gus who also suffers from cancer.

","I started watching this movie being recommended by one of my friends. Good thing is that I didn't see the rating of this movie back then because that makes my vision and expectation specific. So, only knowing that it's a romantic movie released in 2014, I clicked the play button.<br/><br/>And that was that.<br/><br/>Once the movie started, I was totally into the movie and that's what surprised me! The whole thing was so real! The plot is the kind you can somehow predict, but then what makes it so special? I guess it's the acting. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort portrayed the two star-crossed lovers Hazel and Augustus so well that I couldn't but feel their emotion. The script is simple yet enough at what it does. The direction, cinematography and editing are so coherent that no scene seems out of place and that's also another reason to keep you stick to the movie till the end, or even more. And about the soundtracks? I don't need to say a word about the soundtracks during the movie but the song ""All Of The Stars"" by Ed Sheeran during the ending credits is such a song you'd surely love to listen after such a movie. After the movie ended, there was this whole movie flashback in my head and I was left with the feeling that yes, some infinities are simply bigger than other infinities.<br/><br/>One last thing, probably you wouldn't regret now if you don't watch this movie but once you've finished watching, you'd know that you surely would have regretted not watching it.

","I am going to start off this brief, two-paragraph review by saying that I originally had no intentions of seeing this movie, period. This movie was obviously not meant for guys, particularly ones my age, and instead was meant for the young, teen-girl audience. So I figured, ""why bother?"" That being said, I did end up seeing it, and I actually thought it to be a very good film. The characters were given a LOT of depth, Shailene Woodley gave one of the best performances I have seen all year, and the story is not just a typical cancer story. Instead of having the lead characters fine and healthy throughout half the film and becoming sick towards the end, this film is about people that have already moved into the acceptance stage of their illness, and how they learn to enjoy what little time they have left in life. It is a very well-paced movie, the dialog is fine, you will cry at some pointI did, and it has Willem Dafoe (if only for about five minutes). <br/><br/>This film had so much going for it that I really have nothing major to hold against it. The acting was very, very well done, the editing is spot on, and nearly all of the technical components of the film were in top form. All the complaints that I did have with it were extremely minimal, and most of them were fixed by the end of the first act anyway. Because of this, I have to applaud ""The Fault in Our Stars""; it was not meant for my demographic, yet it made me enjoy the movie anyway. There really is not a lot I can say about this movie without sounding cheesy or weird so I will let my rating speak for me. <br/><br/>I am going pretty high on this initial rating (although it may change later on): 9/10."

Part of this is because of the leading actors. The girl is a strong character who forgets her disease to follow a dream, while the boy is a fun character whom everybody would like to have as a friend. And there's plenty more great characters in this movie, especially Willem Dafoe in his role as the writer of the book that inspires a trip to Amsterdam. Ah, and to see Amsterdam in this movie, it's wonderful. I live ten miles from Amsterdam and have been there too many times to count, so it's funny to see a movie about people whom it mattes so much to, to go there. The city looks grand, and it's a great supporting character. All in all, great picture."

","This Film portraits the tragic circumstance of two young lovers who both have cancer and are doomed with a short lifespan, never the less they still love each other deeply. Based on the novel by John Green, the film manages to project a plethora of messages through good acting both from Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort.<br/><br/>The movie bewilders viewers while trying to make them understand the hopes and aspirations of these wonderfully portrayed characters, although it becomes apparent that all those prospects and ambitions that these youngsters exhibit are never coming to fruition because seemingly, death is what governs their lives.<br/><br/>In reality though as the film progresses we understand that death has minimal hold on these people, love is what really drives them. Their love will not last long but it still is an infinity by itself, at least to them. Just like it is explained in the movie, some Infinities are smaller than others, but they're still classified as infinities. A wonderful message.<br/><br/>The film's director, John Broone, manages to explain viewers the story of these two people in a respectful manner while keeping fancy camera work out of it. The Cinematography is not what I would like to focus on as it is not the strongest trait of the film and does not enhance the story telling of the film.<br/><br/>I liked it, and its actors. As such I give this movie an 8/10 and warn viewers to bring handkerchiefs to watch it."

","well this is my first movie review ever though i have watched hundreds of them if not thousands ... this can give you an idea how much i might have liked this movie ... The movie is a ""vanilla love story of two cancer patients"" as told by most people. But actually it is a beautiful metaphorical presentation of pain and survival instinct hidden inside every one of us. Pain is meant to be felt and that's the truth. Writers have done amazing work by painting out the darkness of life with such bright colors that it doesn't scare you but gives you a push to find you path out of shady roads. Every member of the Cast group have done more than justice to their role especially, Ansel Elgort and Shailene Woodley. The two just comes out as the perfect couple though each one's role were missing some parts according to worldly definition. Couldn't ask for more from the director Josh Boone. Such as impeccable presentation of truth, which we all try to ignore in our indulgence for whining and pity, is worthy of applaud.<br/><br/>Net Net - if you want to fall in love with life, watch it. There is something for you."

","Out of all Cancer/malady movies, I like this the most. The Fault in Our Stars is a heart-breaker for sure, but it's also a sweet, romantic film full of sudden warmth and humor. It gets everything right about being young and in love for the first time. There's a moment when the breeziness powering the story goes away and medical reality takes over, and Elgort's performance goes to a surprising new place. Well comparing to ""A Walk to remember"", ""Now is Good"", ""Safe Heaven"" and other Cancer survival movies, They all are pretty much the same. The grief at the end, Make us viewers cry. I mean the character they put an end to and the suffering of their beloved ones. A person just cannot resist to not to cry at the end of the movie."

","Well, I've waited for so long to see this movie, because Tumblr was all over with it and I was just curious. And it was a movie that I could kept watching until the end. The character of Augustus was just amazing, he was strong and special. This is the right word for it. He was special. And I wasn't expecting him to be the one dying in the end, he made us feel that his struggle was over. I have found it a little unrealistic, Hazel's parents dealing with the thought of losing their only child like that, thinking that they'll just can live with that pain. I mean I don't have children but losing a child by cancer is just doesn't make a parent think like that. I don't say that it wouldn't be the right way of thinking.. it would make grief a lot easier to deal with for humans but our consciousness is far from this level right now. Pain, loss and grief makes us blind and this is just the way it is. But then, I just felt sorry for both of them. And in the same time I felt guilty for feeling sorry for them. I couldn't really relate to the struggles of the characters."

Their heroes grow, develop, the certain vital stages pass, become stronger.

I am also a male and I felt the almighty feels.<br/><br/>When I first heard about this film I shrugged it off as one of them ""not as good as you say it is movie"" oh how I was wrong. <br/><br/>I really felt for Hazel in the last part of the film you could easily make a connection with her feelings even though she was trying to act strong and put on a brave face it was amazing the acting skills of this woman are amazing and all credits to her.<br/><br/>Now Augustus the wise cracking 18 year old who brought the comedy the this wonder of a film. The way he could make the bad things seem good by adding a joke or being sarcastic really help lighten the mood of this feel his attitude in this made me think of my favourite quote of all time.<br/><br/>The storyline was amazing but sadly a little bit predictable what is like most films in this genera but that was its only fault wink wink. The way this was edited was amazing the clean cuts the perfectly placed music added to the atmosphere and overall experience of this first class masterpiece not many films like this make it to my top 1% and this one will take a long time to get knock off I would like to leave you with a quote that sums up this film to me in a paragraph. <br/><br/>The longer I live, the more I realise the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me, is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, the education, the money, than circumstances, than failure, than successes, than what other people think or say or do. It is more important than appearance, giftedness or skill. It will make or break a company...a church...a home. The remarkable thing is we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day. We cannot change our past...we cannot change the fact that people will act in a certain way. We cannot change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude. I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to me and 90% of how I react to it. And so it is with you. We are in charge of our attitudes.<br/><br/>LC"
"DareDevilKid","9","0","1","25 August 2014"," Way More than Just a Tearjerker - A Romantic Masterpiece
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4/5 stars<br/><br/>""The Fault in Our Stars"" had amazing pre-release hype, and it lived up to its expectations by all counts. I haven't read John Green's immensely popular novel - and now that I've seen the film, I don't foresee myself reading it in the future - but if the movie has adhered closely to its source, I can see why Green's romantic yarn is so loved. The plot is centered around Hazel and Augustus, two teenagers who share an acerbic wit, a disdain for the conventional, and a love that sweeps them on a journey. Their relationship is all the more miraculous, given that Hazel's other constant companion is an oxygen tank, Gus jokes about his prosthetic leg, and they meet and fall in love at a cancer support group.<br/><br/>Speaking solely from the film's perspective, ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is nothing short of a masterpiece that leaves you with a lump in your throat, teary-eyed, and an almost palpable aura of love engulfing our senses. The Direction is exceptional with a smoothly-flowing narrative that draws you completely in and keeps you emotionally engaged. The writing is of the highest quality with beautifully fleshed out characters that you genuinely care about and want to invest time in, and the dialogues are witty, satirical, and emotional without being mushy.<br/><br/>Lending depth and gravitas to the seamless narrative and incredible writing are the cast of talented actors - irrespective of the length of their role, every actor does a fine job and their performances remain etched in our psyche long after the curtain comes down. Laura Dern as Hazel's (Shailene Woodley) mother and Nat Wolff as Gus' (Ansel Elgort) best mate stand out among the supporting cast, while Willem Dafoe is hauntingly terrific as usual in a bit role. Ansel Elgort is easy on the eye - though he comes across as effortless charming throughout most of the film, he ends up displaying his range towards the end and packs quite a meaty punch in the dramatic and emotional scenes.<br/><br/>However, the sheer standout performance undoubtedly comes from Shailene Woodley, who's literally head and shoulder above the rest of the cast. Whether it is her acerbic wit, acceptance of her fate, emoting through her eyes, or delivering gut-wrenching moments through emotionally harrowing sequences and monologues, Wodley, quite simply, knocks every scene and dialogue of hers out of the park. This is an exceptionally young talent who's not only delivered an act worthy of an Oscar nomination, but it can be easily counted among the decade's best performance from an actress. Shailene Woodley is surely a superstar in the making.<br/><br/>""The Fault in Our Stars"" brings warmth to our hearts, makes us believe in the power of true love, and shows us that even in the most trying times, life can through us an unexpected, enchanting curve ball. It is definitely one of the most touching, emotionally haunting, realistic, and magical love stories ever, and will eventually go down as one of the best romantic movies of all time."

","In a way it hurts me to say this but I liked the movie way more than book. This is the best book adaptation to a movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The book seemed less dramatic than movie. When reading I laughed quite a lot and didn't cry even once. Honestly, the book to me seemed pretentious and disappointing. On the other hand watching the movie I did laugh a few times but my face felt more like crying than smiling.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I was quite surprised to see John Green in the movie himself. But, I guess, if he was working on the set anyways, why not appear in a shot as well?<br/><br/>One of my favorite parts (not related to movie or novel) was the scene at a café where on the table were two giraffes who love giraffes. I was so geeking out about this vlogbrother reference.<br/><br/>Actually, when I think about it, I am not sure I like the plot.

But this time, I have to speak up.<br/><br/>This movie is, like it says in the title, the first movie that I've ever cried to, and I've seen some sad movies. However none of those movies have ever felt so realistic. Even those who were based on a real story. This one however, did. <br/><br/>I could probably go on and write 20 pages on how good the chemistry between the actors is, or how well the movie was written and such. But I'm not going to. Because that isn't what makes a good movie in my honest opinion. It is the feeling you get when you watch the movie that matters. <br/><br/>when watching The Fault In Our Stars, you get the feeling of joy and humor. But also great sadness and sorrow. All this combined with the feeling that you belong in this movie, that this is something that could happen to you or your loved ones. Combining each of those elements is not an easy thing. A few, if any movies have done it. Until now.<br/><br/>No matter if you are an action fan or fantasy fan. No matter what kind of movie you like, you should watch this movie. You will probably feel a great pain in watching it, since it reminds us of all the sad parts in our lives. But it is worth it because honestly pain demands to be felt."

I normally will reject plots that I can see coming but with this story it was journey of getting there that made it suffer-able. <br/><br/>Two more quick points as this is one I would highly recommend for my friends that are softhearted enough to admit as guys we enjoy a good love story as much as the girls do (now and then). I must say the character build up was very well done and acting on both sides was phenomenal and worthy of award consideration my issue is with the bigger picture of how a story like this could very easily have had a deeper meaning. <br/><br/>This was done on a strictly naturalistic level and the lack of ""God"" is very depressing because truth is so very taboo on the silver screen.

They made this,this very good movie with great advertising and from an important and wonderful writer with famous books and served by new breakout stars such as Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort and Nat Wolff.( That was a pretty long sentence, I know.)

I guess the book was very emotional. And I'm guessing that people BEGGED people to make it a movie. And to tell you the truth since that's what I've been doing all along, is that I don't think ANYONE should hate it or regret watching it. Although I honestly don''t think it'll leave a mark in the world.

","The Fault In Our Stars (directed by Josh Boone) is the screen adaptation of the bestselling book of the same name (written by author John Green). Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) is a long-time cancer survivor who carries an obligatory oxygen tank wherever she goes. Concerned with her daughters depressive state (for reasons known to us), Hazel's mother, Frannie Lancaster (played by Laura Dern) lovingly pushes her to attend a cancer support group. While attending said support group, Hazel locks eyes with Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort) and from then on, a blossoming relationship begins.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: Drama central. From this, I mean the all the talk of dealing with tragedy, cancer, death and consequently having to do so at such a young age. The main characters, Augustus and Hazel try to uncover their lives impact, the meaning behind life and aim to experience their short times on earth together. Laura Dern delivered a splendid and non-standardized portrayal of a parent with a terminally ill child. <br/><br/>Funny bits. So that audiences do not sob throughout the entire movie, The Fault in Our Stars has incorporated dashes of comedy. Especially seen in the encounters with their mutual friend Isaac (Nat Wolff). I'll admit that a few of the sickly sweet dialogue between the couple made for some chuckle-some scenes.<br/><br/>THE BAD: Anne Frank's exhibition. Ugh, people actually watched them kiss and started clapping and cheering. I've read other people's takes on this scene being quite fitting considering Anne Frank's narration was playing as Hazel struggled to make it up the stairs of the exhibition. I do not agree. Why would a crowd of people surround you and applaud you, no matter the situation. It felt unrealistic and out of place.<br/><br/>That cigarette close to death metaphor. Hearing the explanation, once was enough. It can only be described as an agonizingly reoccurring bit. Augustus never failed to have an unlit cigarette hanging out of his mouth (being seated on an airplane, rocking up in a limo etc.) <br/><br/>Willem Dafoe. Why Dafoe, Why?. I'm accustomed to seeing him in the less mainstream films (such as Lars von Trier's Antichrist and Nymphomaniac). This appearance is simultaneously unnerving and baffling to say the least. He plays Peter Van Houten, a caricature of a peeved off writer whose last book had caught the admiration of lead character Hazel. Subsequently, the two teens travel to meet him in a scene that can only be described as saddening and utterly bizarre. Eventually, he's villainous behavior is given an explanation in an attempt to give his character depth."

","I tried to avoid the book because of all the hype. That doesn't immediately make sense but what I mean is, I have a sister who reads and watches what other people suggest, but never me, her older sister, who previously suggested many of those books, films etc. Basically reading and watching things that are a craze. However, when I was invited to go see the film i felt inclined to read the book (everyone knows the book is always better) I decided this too late and it was film first. I was impressed by the 8.4 rating for a ""tear-jerking romance"" but was let down. I don't know whether to feel bad for not finishing the book or glad that I didn't already know the ending. It was sad yes...but in a morbid, pessimistic way. Although I will admit that I teared up when Hazel hears the news about Augustus and is believably heartbroken. However, I felt more compelled to produce tears by my friends and the rest of the cinema! Everyone glancing at each other through watery eyes clutching tissues to their faces and smiling in an embarrassed ""it's so sad omg isn't it?!"" way. Initially I wasn't keen on Elgort as Augustus, I imagined him completely differently and he seemed much too cocky and then ""I'm a Virgin"" shy. Woodley is suitably pessimistic and I later warmed to her realistic portrayal as the cancer patient who needed someone like Augustus to make her life consist of more than just illness. Dafoe is great as the moody, alcoholic author who is angry and bitter and wants to be left alone. It was refreshing to see how the wrath of this bitter man brought out the best in the actors and allowed you to feel for the characters rather than just feel sorry for them. The parents, much too smiley/sad/smiley that's the best way to describe it really. I liked it, it was cute, I think I should have read the book and maybe I could have imagined the left out parts together with the film adaption and felt stronger about it. I think that it is a lovely romance but not a great one. For me, I preferred The Notebook.... so 7.7 maybe a 7.8 because it's better than a lot of recent romantic films that miss the mark so often."

","Wow. I don't even know where to begin.<br/><br/>This film is a truly epic story that sucks the viewer in and doesn't let them go. I have rarely come out of a film feeling so emotional, beaten, battered and bruised. What a beautiful portrayal of life and some of its purposes. I thought the acting was outstanding throughout and the soundtrack and cinematography were spot on, all adding to a thoroughly brilliant movie. <br/><br/>I particularly appreciated the effort to stay true to life - this isn't your classic Hollywood blockbuster, this is a beautiful portrayal of two extraordinary yet ordinary lives and you cannot help but become involved in the story as it unfolds.<br/><br/>I always think a good film should lure the viewer into truly caring about the characters and their lives. This did that with almost unrivalled success. A must see."
"vistheindian","7","0","1","22 July 2014"," Not just another teen romance
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Hazel (Shailene Woodley), a terminal cancer patient and Gus (Ansel Elgort), a cancer survivor become friends after meeting for the first time at a cancer support group. Despite the overwhelming circumstances they both have been dealt with, through their friendship that grows into love, Hazel and Gus triumph over the fear of death and oblivion. The Fault In Our Stars is a surprisingly touching movie that is actually smart. Its incredible two leads bring such realism to their characters that make them and the story all the more relatable. A beautifully heartbreaking and heartwarming movie that deserves more recognition.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>Well, I'll be honest when I saw the trailers and saw that this is yet another teen romance novel adaption, I couldn't care less for it. But then slowly I started to hear some good buzz so I got curious. I knew I wasn't the target demographic, this was made even clearer to me when I realized there was literally one other male in the entire cinema (no exaggeration) and he was there with his girlfriend. So I was the only single male in his 20s watching The Fault In Our Stars. Which is a shame because I enjoyed the movie and think more people should go out and see it.<br/><br/>There is a reason why some people avoid movies that are based on teen romance novels, because they tend to sugar coat and glorify the love aspect of the story and ignore realistic hardships that comes with relationships **sneeze** Twilight **sneeze** (sorry, allergic too crap movies, can't help it). But let me be absolutely clear, The Fault In Our Stars is not that kind of movie. Both Hazel and Gus are instantly likable characters. They are witty and smart, and that comes across very well thanks to the strong script. Gus especially is this extremely optimistic person and by being with him Hazel finally feels like she doesn't need to be defined by her cancer. At the same time Hazel helps Gus realize to cherish the memories he makes with the people he loves. All of what I described doesn't happen in an instant, it all takes time just like it would in real life. That is why when they eventually fall in love and see them suffer with cancer together, it is completely believable.<br/><br/>This is not a movie that only people dealing with cancer or people who know others with cancer will relate to. Everyone will be touched by the story of Gus and Hazel. I could hear half the theater sniffling and in tears, and understandably so.<br/><br/>So I must say if you are on the fence about this movie, I say give it a chance. It may not be a perfect movie but it doesn't have to be. I am thankful I gave it that chance.<br/><br/>P.S. I know I have male friends that feel like they will be dragged to this movie by their significant other. So guys and girls, if you feel the same way, trust me this is a pretty good one to be dragged to.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"

","The Fault in Our Stars put a smile on my face from start to finish, mainly because I had read the book. It does the book justice in wonderful fashion. The characters are very well put together in the film. Isaac in particular gets a lot more of personality and more funny moments in the film than in the book. Props to the writers for that! Also, the film has a wonderful sense of pace. It is able to blend the same realistic humor and drama together from the book seamlessly well. It was also very creative with its visuals as well. For those of you who don't know, the book the film's based on contains a lot of texts and emails during Hazel and Gus's conversations. I like how the movie didn't stick to one style. Sometimes thought bubbles filled the screen and other times the camera showed the screen Hazel was texting on. That being said, do I think this movie is flawless? No. For starters this film has A lot of pop songs. Like I mentioned in my Divergent review, props to them for actually using their soundtrack, but they didn't need to include so many to begin with. Also, the film makes certain parts a lot more sappy and therefore more clique than in the book. It's ironic how much the film tries to stay AWAY from these cliques but sometimes falls right into it. It's almost as if the film was originally made in a unique way, then the director thought ""Wait, this film still needs to make money"" and decided to add a hint of Hollywood cheese. Either way, this movie was a lot of fun to watch. I can overlook its flaws to be very content with this one. There are few faults in these stars."
"georgecoffeynewyorker","7","0","1","3 July 2014"," Powerful stuff
","Well the movie was quite interesting but hugely emotional. The plot was quite simple, but complex at the same time. From what I could gather it was initially suggested that one of the lovers, which I will outline in due course, was dying of cancer. However as I rightly pointed out, it was actually both of em. Hazel(Woodley) is dieiing of cancer. Not sure the exact medicinal name. She has an Oxygen Tank to help her around. When she was a kid, she had an episode whereby her lungs were fluidly. She is being put on tablets as an experiment to absorb the fluid in her lungs. So afterwards, we see that she is highly depressed and her Mom suggests a Cancer Support group in an Episcopal church. Here she meets Gus(Augustus Waters - what a lovely name)(Elgort). He's some babe alrite. So precious. He too is dying of cancer. We are introduced with him as in he comes in with a mate of his Isaac(Wolfff). He too has a medical condition, in his case the Eyes. He eventually goes blind. Gus however is dying. His cancer has affected his leg and hence has a Prosthetic leg. Isaac's girlfriend Monica dumps him when he goes fully blind, sighting she can't deal with a person being blind. Gus and Hazel go out with each other and develop romantic feelings for each other. He uses a lovely metaphor with cigarettes. He is about to light the cigarette. He continues that if he DOESN'T light the cigarette that the cancer cannot be made worse ""You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing. A metaphor."". So it is revealed that Hazel is book reader ie a book worm. She has this particular book that's of interest to her. She wants to head on over to Amsterdam, where the Author is living. The scene of where Gus was on the plane and was told that was ""his first time"". I said to my friend, I can totally sympathize with him. As the plane was taking off, I felt I was actually on the plane. It went right through me. I just have a fear of flying especially with the taking off. Even the thought of it, makes me wanna vomit. I just can't handle it. Ill prob need Valium to control my anxiety. As Gus was taking off, on the plane, I felt his pain and excitement, I was the same. When the plane was moving, he was smiling and excited and likewise myself. When the plane reveed up to take off, He started to get anxious like me. Gus was so me(ahem the plane scene that is). Then he said about the scenery looking out the window. Yep you guessed it. Same with me. Shame I couldn't take pics on the plane. I think these days, you can. Then shortly afterwards they arrived safe and sounds in Amsterdam. They came across Peter Van Houten(Dafoe) who is the book author that Hazel is madly in love with. She wanted to know the ending of the book. He insulted her to the hills with particular reference to her illness. I was so crushed to hear such words. That she is "" failed experiment in mutation."" HE was such an ass. Gus reveals to Hazel that his cancer has come back with a vengeance. And hence he set up a ""Pre-Funeral"". He wants her to read a eulogy. Sadly Gus passed away. The cancer ate up his heart, previously his legs went. The scene where she was crying her eyes, lots of emotions came to mind. Namely my mom's death(which obv hasn't occurred) and my exs breakup as my heart was giving out to me with the stress of the breakup."
"nicolechan916","8","0","1","20 July 2014"," Great acting that brought the depth of the characters out.
","I think this is the first time in history where I have liked the film better than the book. With all the hype surrounding the book and everyone who read it saying that they cried and loved the book to death, I just didn't see what it was all about. Sure it's a sad story and all, but it didn't make me cry and I didn't get it. However, watching it on screen made a significant difference.<br/><br/>The cast I feel, was absolutely a perfect match for the characters, and the acting was superb. The chemistry between everyone was just spot on. Maybe that's why it did even more justice to the book. I feel that that's the way film adaptations of books should be; to bring the characters to life so that readers/the audience gets an insight to the characters which will have a stronger impact. However, I feel that this will be one a in a million.<br/><br/>The film followed very closely to the book, but I feel that they made Gus the main witty person. In the book Hazel was equally as witty and the banter between them was what kept the dialogue fresh.<br/><br/>And it's not really a problem I have, but more of a questionwhy would the parents let her drive? I mean, I guess it's OK for people with cancer to drive as long as they're not in a critical stage, but she has problems BREATHING. Isn't that incredibly risky? She already has cancer why do they want to risk her dying earlier due to a car accident? I'm thinking the answer to my question lies in the bookbut I can't remember. Maybe they just want her to do whatever and live the rest of her life happily. It just seems pretty risky to me.<br/><br/>The ending for me, was really well done. It basically summarized what the whole story was about in one word. A very well made and edited film.<br/><br/>Read the full review at championangels.wordpress.com"

","Took five minutes to get I to the film but then was totally gripped. Such a sad but powerful movie which makes you leave the cinema feeling sorry for people in that situation and how lucky you are. The two main leads played the part brilliantly and had so much chemistry. The sidekick was a bit bizarre is parts and not that funny esp.<br/><br/>Apple clearly sponsored the film and was great marketing for them. Did not see it coming when Gus told Hazel he was actually dying. Very powerful and upsetting. It would of been nice if they got engaged in Amsterdam and married back in USA. It was nice the author came to the funeral at the end.<br/><br/>Overall a great movie and left the cinema shocked and moved at the story."
"arvindsasikumar921","9","0","1","18 July 2014"," Real hard to keep out the tears
","I stepped into the theater hoping for a good movie. I had seen the ratings on IMDb and 8.4 was a very good score for a romantic drama. I must say that I entered the cinema hall with high expectations but guess what? I came out more satisfied than ever, literally trying hard to keep my tears from rolling down my cheeks.<br/><br/>This movie portrays the romantic life of two cancer patients and it is as good and as realistic as it gets. No useless stuff, no made up scenarios - it all seems natural. I haven't read the book so I had no idea what was coming and whatever was thrown at me, I found it really good. I couldn't predict how it would end (atleast not exactly how it actually ended) and it was a pleasant (though sad) surprise. The story isn't sad - You start with 2 cancer patients, you know how its gonna end. But the love that bonds the lead characters even in a time of unbearable difficulty and to know that it will not last long is heart breaking. Even much before the movie ended, I was contemplating as to what will happen to the characters later on in the story.<br/><br/>If you are looking for an amazing romantic drama, this is the best and the most realistic as it will ever get. For those who cannot hold back their tears, make sure you bring lots of tissues along, you'll need it."

The carefree and confident Gus is reduced to tears and fear as he faces his own mortality and it is then that the inspired Hazel comforts him and frees him of his fears..in return of a small infinity that he gifts her in her numbered days with him, she gives him immortality in her thoughts. thats a heavy duty yet significant message and yes it makes one wonder, that women afterall are the stronger set and bear the ultimate brunt. He was the cool and confident guy and even sweetly cocky when he really got scared when his time came to face the challenge. and she who had been so cynical adapted to life after love and showed him the real import of what he had taught her. yes it gets so beautifully tangled that you are at once depressed, hopeful and thrilled. sounds like life does it..thats the movie for ya."

"YJLcool","8","0","1","14 July 2014"," A heartwarming, touching, beautiful romantic drama comedy film
","Based on the popular romantic novel by John Green, The Fault in Our Stars is another story about a pair of star-crossed lovers who care immensely for each other but couldn't be together due to their unfortunate circumstances. I believe for those who have never read the book or watched the trailer would assume that this film to be those weepy, sappy melodramatic mess, right? Well, not exactly.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film is a heartwarming and touching love story wrapped in exceedingly witty dialogue and memorable one liners, successfully preventing itself from making its way into melodramatic territory. The comedy and romance is well-balanced. The film is also slightly mature and wise in its content and character perspectives: What is oblivion? Is there any meaning or purpose in life? Can we truly outlast death by being remembered by everyone in the world? What should we actually seek in our short life?<br/><br/>The main female lead, Hazel, who suffered through cancer most of her life, doesn't anticipate much from her life, as her days are numbered. Out of nowhere, here comes Augustus, a surprisingly charming cancer survivor who's seemingly optimistic about his future. Augustus's charming smile and his relentless devotion of love for Hazel captured her heart. They're both equally smart and the on-screen chemistry between Shailene (Hazel) and Ansel (Augustus) made their instant connection believable.<br/><br/>Shailene and Ansel both provide convincing performances as a couple. The romance was subtle, feels honest and realistic for the audience to emotionally invested in them. Their affection for each other deepens as the film progresses and it's heartbreaking to see that this relationship doesn't last. (I don't think I'm spoiling it, as we all know what we signed up for even before watching it). The film doesn't overly exploit the romance drama that's usually comes with the chronic disease, which is commendable. Rather than making it the typical depressing melodramatic tearjerker, the film has a bittersweet ending with surprising depth and meaning about life.<br/><br/>The eulogies written by the leads for each other is thought-provoking and heartfelt at the same time. I have a few gripes about the film though...I would appreciate if the film adds more scenes about their cancer sufferings. Cancer is not a joke. The film seemingly gives an impression to the general audience that stage 4 cancer sufferers can still live and converse normally like many others without the repetitive time-consuming treatments, dealing with severe side effects from drugs or countless hospitalization. The film does feel draggy a bit in some parts as well. Overall, despite some shortcomings, The Fault in Our Stars is still undeniably a decent romantic drama comedy that's well worth your time and money.<br/><br/>http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/07 Rating: 8/10"
"raulfaust","8","0","1","12 July 2014"," Counting stars
","Well, as the movie began, I really had my doubts whether it would be any good or not, mainly due to the quite fast-paced plot and the exaggerated character of Gus. I mean, he was only eighteen (or twenty?) years old and acted like someone too mature for his age; he was just so-good at everything. He was intelligent, well-bred, humble, good looking and so on; his character felt too unrealistic for me, and I believed the whole movie would feel that way. However, I got the opposite; everything else felt credible. The characters are well written, with highlights to Van Houten, whose quotes are funny for being too absurd. The directing is highly professional, delivering lots of intense scenes, like almost all involving the main couple. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort are also very professional, and I can't find words to express how proud I feel for them. They, along with the marvelous directing, are what make this film so intense, sentimental, romantic and somehow, sad. I didn't feel like crying for any moment, but I heard that a lot of people did, so that's a proof of how realistic the story looks like, even if using a clichéd main plot. Some people may consider it to be an overly-sentimental picture, but I believe there are films more appellative than this in the genre. Therefore, if you're going to watch it, keep in mind that there will be some (or a lot of) romanticism. All in all, it's another great surprise in 2014!"

","I have not read the book that the movie Fault in Our Stars is based on but I have heard good things about it. The movie is good. Interesting in a world of social media and the information age, the one thing this generation is striving for is love and human connection. I watched this film late one night with a room full of tweeners and a bit older crowd. I heard the girls swoon to the characters and even shed a tear or two. The story revolves around two teenagers, Hazel and Gaus, who both are diagnosed with terminal disease. They don't focus on their limited time or share in their anger that they will never grow old but fate has it they find each other. This combination of souls are the ideal of any romantic and what Hollywood seems probable on the big screen is often not true in real life when mixed up with the complexity of life. There are some very touching scenes and even an old cynic like me was warmed by this movie that rekindled my inner yearning for a happily ever after."
"aahari5","10","0","1","12 July 2014"," A Heart Breaking and Beautiful Film
","Calling The Fault in Our Stars a teen flick might sound a little bit stereotypical. Yes, the primary target audience of this film is young adults, but there are so many heavy emotions and relatable themes that it can even appeal to an older audience as well. All of the issues that the film covers are real and tragic and we as an audience can feel for the characters and even grow to love them.<br/><br/>Watching Hazel and Augustus cope and struggle with their terminal cancer diagnoses feels so powerful that it appears as though it is really happening. Their love for each other grows even as their conditions worsen. You can feel the pain that they feel and the deep bond that they share.<br/><br/>As I sat in the theater with my girlfriend next to me in my arms, I realized that life can end at any given second. She is to me what Hazel was to Augustus. Perhaps the greatest lesson that I learned from this film is that if you love someone, let them know it. Spend every second you can with them and make them the happiest person in the world, because tomorrow it could all end. The relationship between Augustus and Hazel did not feel real... because it was real. There was no acting. It was genuine and heartfelt and we could feel the growing sense of sorrow and pain as Augustus' health began to rapidly decline. We grew to love them as human beings, not characters, and were torn apart when the ending of the film arrived.<br/><br/>I love this film. I love it because of its heartfelt lesson that life is beautiful and that one should love it as they love the person that they wish to spend it with. This is a film that needs to be seen because of its sheer power and its message."

"estebangonzalez10","8","0","1","7 July 2014"," Balances the melodrama with humor and romance really well
","""You gave me a forever within the numbered days, and I'm grateful.""<br/><br/>The Fault in Our Stars is one of those rare romantic melodramas that succeeds thanks to its talented cast and its believable script. Considering how easy it could've been to emotionally manipulate and exploit the audience with the material, director Josh Boone did an excellent job of recreating a tender love story while avoiding clichés and one dimensional characters. I was unfamiliar with John Green's bestselling novel which this film was based on, but I had high expectations for this film considering the script was adapted by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber whose work in 500 Days of Summer and The Spectacular Now I highly admired. The Fault in Our Stars didn't disappoint thanks to yet another powerful performance from Shailene Woodley (in my opinion her best work), who played her character in such a natural way that she made the story feel believable. Considering the subject matter this film could've been over manipulative, but it never feels this way thanks to a smart and intelligent script and some strong performances. The film balances these dramatic moments with grace and there were also some very funny moments that helped lighten the mood when things got grim. This isn't like other cancer dramas (I'm mostly thinking of My Sisters Keeper here) which have mostly failed by being too exploitive, because this film handles the material with grace. It's still a heartbreaking film, but it is much more natural in the way it approaches the material. This is one of those rare chick flicks that guys will actually enjoy as well.<br/><br/>This love story is narrated by Hazel Grace (Shailene Woodley), a teenager who has been diagnosed with stage 4 thyroid cancer and has to carry an oxygen tank with her at all times in order to breathe. In an effort to get her out of the house, her parents, Frannie (Laura Dern) and Michael (Sam Trammell), convince her to join a cancer support group. Despite thinking it's a waste of time, something good comes out of it when she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort). He happens to be there supporting his friend, Isaac (Nat Wolff), who has a tumor in his eye and is about to lose his sight. Augustus himself is a former cancer survivor who lost his leg and is now wearing a prosthetic one. From the moment they bumped into each other at the support group, he just can't take his eyes off her and easily wins Hazel over with his charm and wit. The two become good friends although their relationship seems to be a bit more limited by time than most other couples.<br/><br/>In order for a film like this to work it is important that the two main characters share a strong and believable chemistry together. The Fault in Our Stars makes the most out of this thanks to strong and natural performances from both Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort. The chemistry between the two is amazing allowing the relationship to feel authentic and captivating at the same time. We've all seen what Woodley can do, and she has been amazing in every film she's been in, but this is, in my opinion her best performance to date. Ansel Elgort on the other hand completely took me by surprise as I wasn't too impressed with his work in Divergent, but here he is incredibly charming. Nat Wolff, who was one of the main characters in Josh Boone's previous film (Stuck in Love), has an important supporting role here considering his character helps break some of the dramatic tension with several laugh out loud moments. Those scenes really helped lighten up the mood and made this a much funnier film than what I was expecting. Laura Dern and Sam Trammell are also convincing as the parents who are dealing with their daughter's condition. The scenes that really didn't work for me however, were the ones involving Willem Defoe as the author of Hazel's favorite novel. Those scenes were just too weird and took me out of the story, but it's my only complaint for an otherwise incredibly captivating and tear inducing romantic drama."

","While one might step into the theater expecting just an amazing love story of a young couple, you might actually leave the hall with whole lots of additional surprising beautiful thoughts. It brilliantly combines humors, love, inspiring and heartbreaking moments of the two main characters who suffer from cancers. Other than the love of the adorable couple, it is also well balanced with the sweet family relationship and friendship; which all of these elements are switching well between the fictional and the medical parts. Both Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort spark a great chemistry, they immerse well into the characters and illustrate the audiences with different level of emotions. The film does not use much of scores, instead choose to manipulate musics that indeed fit the story perfectly. It may also be one of the most pathetic film with sad moments and cancer suffering, but the true beauty of this film is its beautiful metaphors and soul-salving quotes that remind all of us not to give up easily, as life is always amazing for everyone."

","I have looked after young people who face death from cancer. This film adaption of a much loved book deals very honestly but sympathetically with these themes. Went with my daughter, who is not much older than the main characters portrayed in the film. A lot of my emotion came from realising again how I need to value our relationship in the present, as you never know what is coming. Was very funny in parts and the leads played this strongly all the way through, really believed in them as people. Have thought about it quite a bit afterwards, which is always a mark of a good film for me.<br/><br/>Some of the character development was really well judged, the guy leading the support group appeared to be a stereotype but then a later scene shows his ability to cut to the heart of an issue.<br/><br/>I thought the parents were not very well developed, particularly Gus's parents but the film was already long enough and focusing on the leads was probably the right choice.<br/><br/>We went on a 'habit breaker', just turning up and seeing what was next on at our local cinema.

","when i read the book i rated it 4/5 for a reason: i really really liked the books but in my opinion there is a lot of philosophy that can be removed . meanwhile, i watched the movie and i can say it's amazing : it's the first movie i like more than the book . usually i don't like the movies because they are nothing compared to the books . but this is an exception: the movie is so much like the book, nothing new is created . it's typically like the book but the only difference is that in the movie they have deleted a lot of the philosophy i didn't like and they kept the amazing ones . so it's worth a 10/10 and it's the first movie i rated it more than the book"

","3 1/2 out of 4 stars.<br/><br/>John Green's novel ""The Fault In Our Stars"" has been a big hit for the past couple years. It tells the story of two teenagers with cancer who fall in love. It was only a matter of time until it was turned into a movie and fans of the book will not be disappointed by the film.<br/><br/>Josh Boone's 2014 adaption of ""The Fault In Our Stars"" stays true to the novel thanks to its writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber (who also wrote ""500 Days of Summer"" and ""The Spectacular Now""). There were one or two changes from the book and some things had to be eliminated. If the film had an extra half-hour or hour, it would be exactly like the book. I have read the book and the things they had to take out make sense. <br/><br/>Boone's adaptation works very well thanks to its strong cast. Shailiene Woodley is great as Hazel and she has great chemistry with Ansel Elgort (who plays Augustus). Nat Wolff, Laura Dern, and Willem Dafoe are also well cast. Although it can be sappy at times, the cast makes the line works and we can care about these characters.<br/><br/>The film does have its faults, though. The editing is awkward at times and I thought the exposition seemed just a little rushed. The music is good for the most part, but there are awkward moments where the music doesn't work (""Boom Clap"" by Charli XCX being the strangest). However, there are moments where the music fits perfectly, like Ray LaMontagne's ""Without Words"" and M83's ""Wait.""<br/><br/>""The Fault In Our Stars"" is effectively brought to the big screen. Fans of the book and people who haven't read it should enjoy it. It may not be a movie for everybody, but it's a solid adaptation."
"DoctorMike1","9","0","2","30 June 2014"," Went to see a real life type movie and was not disappointed.
","Not all movies are Academy Award caliber.<br/><br/>The characters fit their roles. There was no Pam Anderson or similar male lead playing a cancer victim. Yes there were a few awkward scenes. Ones that made you think why did they do that. But, the message of the movie was one that made you feel decent human emotions.<br/><br/>If you want to critique a movie based on some higher cinematic criteria, something other than reality, then review Edge of Tomorrow or Transformers. Don't get me wrong, when I want to escape reality I head for the science fiction or 3D animations and enjoy my time watching these movies.<br/><br/>When I want to see a movie that I think is an Oscar contender I go see that movie with that thought in my mind and review it accordingly.<br/><br/>When I watch a movie intended to make us think about God, life, caring for each other, then I want to see something such as The Fault in Our Stars.<br/><br/>When I want to see a movie that makes me somehow feel good about humanity, that lets me think that we are not all self absorbed, money grubbing degenerates, then I go see a movie like The Fault in Our Stars, Heaven Is for Real or God's Not Dead.<br/><br/>Watching these movies makes me walk out of the theater feeling good and wanting to make a difference in people's lives.<br/><br/>And, when I review these movies I do so thinking did they reach their target audience? Did they make me experience the emotions that fit the storyline? Did the movie bring me back closer to the people around me? And if I answer yes to these questions, then the movie was worth seeing and recommending to others.<br/><br/>If that's what you want to experience then go see The Fault in Our Stars."

","I was waiting forward for this movie simply because I read the book and the trailer looked promising. As a reader, I found it represented the novel quite well despite the fact that (of course) some parts didn't make it to the scene, including my favorite line about Amsterdam, freedom and sin. Those beautiful actors played their part beautifully, although some scenes that were supposed to be ""painful"" didn't seem as painful as it should be. Yes, my emotion as a spectator wasn't built as strong as when I read the written version. I was a bit moved while Isaac was reading his eulogy but not a single tear was shed. I came into the cinema with a pack of Kleenex and it remained full until the end of the show. Anyway that ""Okay- Okay"" part nailed it, it made me walk out of the cinema smiling :)"
"roy-kane-rk","8","0","1","28 June 2014"," A great film, just not exactly the same as the book.
","All in all it was a great movie. Being a fan of the book, seeing Shailene Woodley as Hazel was disappointing. I personally didn't think she was a good choice. Still a pretty good adaptation of the book. I just have a few complaints: In the book, Gus had an ex-girlfriend who died of cancer named Caroline Mathers. Gus being in a prior relationship contributed greatly to the story. Also, in the book, Hazel has a friend named Kaitlyn, I don't recall Kaitlyn being a character in the film. A few more forgotten characters, Gus' sisters and nephews. All in all a great film. However, having read the book a few times, I was dissatisfied with the character neglect."
"xSaracasm","7","0","3","28 June 2014"," Sick movie! Quite literally
","This movie is about a cute (sick) love story of Hazel Grace and Augustus, two cancer-stricken teenagers who met in a support group. It's not entirely a unique kind of love story, but at least it's not about vampires , ahem.<br/><br/>Having read the book before seeing the film, I have to say I have a lot of respect to the director for staying true to the book. While I'm happy the film didn't stray too far from the novel, I feel like everything was rushed and compressed into this 2-hour movie.<br/><br/>Good news or bad news?<br/><br/>Okay bad. One, I was a little disappointed that the movie made it seem like Hazel's life only revolved around Gus. Sure it's a love story, but people don't stop having non-cancer friends once they get cancer. Hazel has a life outside Gus; she goes out with friends, she goes to school.. Or something. Which leads me to my second disappointment. The author, John Green, had a cameo in a mall scene (where Hazel hung out with someone other than Gus) but it was deleted. I mean, the movie would not be possible if it weren't for freaking John Green! Third, the film almost completely neglected the video game books that Gus, and eventually Hazel, were so obsessed about (not that it mattered that much). And finally (this part goes for the novel cause it wasn't included in the film), I just don't see anything alright with the idea of Gus being interested in Hazel the first time he saw her because she looked like his deceased ex-girlfriend. At least that's how I see it from how it was written. Anyway, the last piece of bad news probably made the movie a little better because it wasn't included. Moving on..<br/><br/>The good. The film stayed true to the book. The support group, Isaac's breakdown, the Funky Bones, the Anne Frank House kiss, the steamy you- know-what-they-did scene, the pre-funeral... I could go on for another 30 minutes describing how beautiful those scenes (and more) were brought to life. These scenes were how I imagined them as I read the book, if not better. I love how the mood of a certain scene translates to my own as I watch it, so good it gave me goosebumps! Oh, and it's true what they say that you have to bring tissues, the entire theater will cry. Hell, I usually feel embarrassed if I feel like crying over a movie, but with this one? Go ahead, no one's gonna judge you."

Hazel lets Augustus into her life, knowing the consequences and knowing its not the best idea, but she does it anyway, fearless, hazel is a fictional character, but she could never be more real, her personality is real, her personality is as real as it can be, real means fearless, or strong enough to get over your fear thank you John Green"
"Pharmacat","6","0","2","27 June 2014"," Trite, predictable, depressing ... but not without merit
","Given the reviews, and even the preview, I expected so much more from this movie. <br/><br/>The movie is about 2 teens who meet and fall in love; all the while cancer is hovering ominously in the background.<br/><br/>Despite its predictability there is much to appreciate in this film. I was engaged from start to finish; the film feels like it goes by quickly. Occasionally it's amusing, usually due to Gus' fantastic wit. Gus is a teenage girl's dream: he's super-confident, with a very open stance to life shown even by how he stands; he looks like a portrait of style and health in his signature leather jacket; he's incredibly, surprisingly funny at times; and most distinctively, he won't be discouraged or deterred or successfully rebuffed by any amount of stonewalling or reluctant rejection from Hazel, but is utterly determined to wear her down with his persistent affection. <br/><br/>Magically, (as though a Hollywood screenwriter wrote a script for him!) he knows just what to say to slither his way through the 1 narrow crack in Hazel's heart, as the trailer shows. This feature could either be a pro or con. On the 1 hand, the screenwriter knows what teens want to hear and see from a teenage boyfriend. Namely, a guy who is totally crazy about you- without you doing anything, and apparently, even though he barely knows you! <br/><br/>I really enjoy Shailene Woodley as an actress. She seems habitually cast in the role of a young woman who could easily be a wallflower, with a subtle/quiet personality, but who, upon examination, has an endearing way about her. Shailene as Hazel is as winsome as she could be, within the constraints of the script and plot (which is also true of Gus' character). Her mannerisms are natural and as always, she's a sympathy- garnering, enjoyable character to watch, though I didn't see the sense of humor that Gus compliments her on, nor any special or distinct qualities that would cause me to view her through Gus' ostensibly enamored eyes. <br/><br/>This movie was pure sap through and through. Some viewers like this, but for me it felt very heavy, enclosed, even suffocating. Basically all love stories center on 2 people, looking at each other. But when the 3rd main character is cancer, which is present from the start and eventually separates the characters, that is a surefire formula for a very heavy drama. Added to this mix is the story's apparent philosophy of nihilism, positing that there's nothing out there and nothing thereafter, only this life. (This makes one question, what if Gus had never met Hazel? What about the tons of kids who die of cancer without much love in their lives; were their lives then just a drop of water in a huge pool, leaving ripples for a few seconds then leaving no sign of ever having existed in any significant way?) I left the theatre quite depressed and somewhat annoyed by the cloying heaviness of the movie. <br/><br/>As other reviewers have stated, the plot line follows a familiar course, and one gets a sense of deja vu: haven't I see this before? This makes me sigh and wonder why this film couldn't have been more creative, mixed it up more. <br/><br/>Also, even after 2 hours, I still don't feel like I know the characters, since the plot focuses on their obsession with a book and meeting an author, but we are given no insight into the psyches of these characters in many major areas of their lives. I feel like I'm given a glimpse into the romance of 2 characters, but that major pivotal information is left out that would enable me to understand them better and care more about their story. As a result I cared very little about whether their love would endure or be terminated early by cancer or other circumstances.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a better teen romance, I recommend Shailene Woodley's ""The Spectacular Now."" That movie is much better at opening one's mind to embrace life, instead of closing our minds with a predictable plot and depressing philosophy."

I do give a congratulations to Josh Boone, Scott Neustadter, Michael H.

The Fault in Our Stars is worth seeing but I do recommend that you see it either(A)on your own or (B)with anybody that is not a teenager girl that read the book and says,""This is going to be best movie ever!"", until Mockingjay comes out in the fall, because she will ruin it when she stars crying in an obnoxious matter at all of the obvious parts of the movie.

","Teenage terminal cancer sufferer Hazel, attending a support group under protest, meets the sparky, entertaining and attractive Gus, also a cancer sufferer, but in remission. The two of them find much to like in each other, and emotions grow.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book on which this film was based. Taken solely on its own merits, it is a rather likable and entertaining take on a very serious subject as it tries to draw a distinction between, one one hand, who people are and, on the other, the handicaps under which they may live. The performances are universally good: the quality comes in little moments, well-written, which give the actors a chance to shine (for me, the best of these was the moment when Gus' supreme self-confidence cracks when Grace is about to see his amputated leg for the first time). Shailene Woodley as Grace gives another great performance, of a quality able to carry the film (albeit she doesn't need to due to very able support by Ansel Elgort as Gus). Woodley has the quality of being both beautiful and ordinary at the same time, which makes her a compelling screen presence, and the fact that she can act doesn't hurt, either.<br/><br/>A film about teenagers with terminal cancer is never going to have a conventionally happy ending, but this film does well by a) delivering a positive ending, b) entertaining us throughout, c) giving us some surprises along the way, and d) playing fair with its subject matter. If I had one criticism, it would be that ugly people get cancer, too.<br/><br/>I left the cinema dry-eyed, but I suspect that many may not."

","If A Walk To Remember and My Sister's Keeper had a baby, this would be it. The Fault in Our Stars is just like any other cancer love story. One of them has cancer (or in this case both), and one dies before the other can do something amazing. It just seems like the whole scenario is overused. At least this didn't glamorize having cancer like most of those movies do. It showed how hard it was, instead of everybody trying to make the situation better. Even though it had the ""Star-crossed lovers"", it wasn't a total cliché. The only problem was with the dialogue, and the whole thing with metaphors. Not everything is a metaphor, and nobody talks the way Augustus does. And news flash, nobody just puts a unlit cigarette in their mouth, just because it's a ""metaphor."""

","I'm not writing this review because I loved the film, I'm simply writing this to argue the 1 and 2 star reviews it got. The plot was clichéd and done before and boring, it wasn't, it was something a big different, it pushed some boundaries and encouraged laughter, acceptance and empathy out of the audience.<br/><br/>People on here are saying a girl who from 13 knew she was going to die, they call her pessimistic, I mean come on, I bet those people moan about pointless day to day worries such as money, possessions and work. Dying of cancer is a real problem! Get a grip.<br/><br/>It was well acted, funny in parts, it also pulled at my heart strings and I cried a few times, sure in some parts it's easy to predict!

","I mean, wow. From the moment it started I was immediately sucked straight into the beautiful and traumatic world of these two characters Hazel and Augustus. Now, I have read the book, and the book is so incredible it made me doubt how this film would turn out. I had very high hopes for this film and was incredibly scared they were going to ruin the book. I could not be more wrong. I cried so many times and was completely 100% captivated. It is definitely the best film I have seen this year, beating out my love for Captain America: The Winter Soldier.The chemistry between the characters was so captivating and incredible was so heart-grabbing, and I cant even begin to speak about the casting department without getting overwhelmed! They could not have casted a better cast for this film. Shailene Woodley, Ansel Elgort, and Nat Wolff are so extraordinary in this film, that word does not even do them justice! They 100% absolutely created such emotion, comedy and beauty straight up. I am a particular fan of Ansel Elgort, and the way he played his character Augustus Waters. It reflects the character in the book perfectly, down to the captivating smile and quick wit, he really made the character come to life and made the film incredible. Ansel made this film funny and witty and made you instantly fall in love with the character. The chemistry between the whole cast was stunning and really showed in the film, it made it seem so real, which is what this film intended to do, the actors brought such emotion. Issac, played by Nat Wolff, was so funny, intentionally and unintentionally, he was brilliant, I would argue he made the film completely what it is, brilliant! All the other characters were casted perfectly, and again, consistently with the book. They did miss out a few scenes from the book in this film, which I expected, but they managed to only cut out minor scenes, the film was extremely close the book and was just, lacking a better word, perfect. It moved me, and everyone in the cinema, including the guys, I recommend everyone goes and see it, you don't have to read the book to be moved by this film, but the film will make you WANT to read it, it is that good. Even the soundtrack is incredible and the camera work is just exquisite! You are under direct orders to go and see this film, just make sure to take lots of tissues, its a non-stop heart-wrenching, tear-jerking, beautiful romantic drama, and with the help of some incredible acting and directing, it is also a little comedic!"

"shawneofthedead","6","0","1","26 June 2014"," A very faithful adaptation of an affecting but troubled novel.
","These days, young-adult fiction is everywhere: dystopian stories of moody youths undergoing strife, war and heartache, as in The Hunger Games or Divergent, are dominating the bestseller lists and popping up in cineplexes. What's so unusual about The Fault In Our Stars, an adaptation of John Green's best-selling novel, is that it locates the dystopia and war within the bodies of its teenage protagonists. These kids aren't battling an evil regime or fascist overlords; they're struggling to survive against the merciless onslaught of cancer. Green's book is a bit of an odd beast: touching but manipulative, genuine and fake, all at the same time. The resulting film, being hugely faithful to its source material, thus manages to pull off the same curious trick of overwhelming and underwhelming the viewer, often in the same breath.<br/><br/>Hazel (Shailene Woodley) has been living with - or dying of - terminal cancer for years. Her concerned parents (Mike Trammell: under-used; and Laura Dern: wonderfully sympathetic) fuss around her constantly, wanting her to live what life is left to her after the treatments and exhaustion have taken their toll. And so Hazel attends a support group for kids stricken with cancer. One day, she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a charming, sweet kid whose remission came at the price of a leg. They share an immediate connection, one that deepens as they bond over Hazel's favourite book: An Imperial Affliction, penned by reclusive author Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe). Knowing how much it means to Hazel, Augustus resolves to get her the answers she seeks about the novel - even if they have to travel all the way to Amsterdam to get them.<br/><br/>If that sounds like a recipe for melodrama, that's because it is. There's plenty of that in store, of course, because these kids are dealing with the worst and most traumatic of experiences, at a time when they should be healthy and carefree. But the film, as did the novel, does a pretty good job of maintaining a spark of cheeky life amidst all the doom and gloom. Hazel and Augustus trade banter as easily as they do insults, and the affection that grows between them is as entertaining as it is affecting. Woodley and Elgort share a gentle chemistry that works very well, whether they're in the throes of first love or battling through the trenches of disease side by side. Their friendship with Isaac (Nat Wolff), the boy who loses his sight to eye cancer and his girlfriend to her self-absorption, is wonderfully bittersweet too - together, the trio ride the lows of Isaac's depression, and the highs of his tiny moment of vengeance.<br/><br/>But, for everything that feels raw and real in the film, The Fault In Our Stars also comes across as overly plotted. Hazel and Augustus are designed specifically to break your heart and swell your tear ducts, which is why their relationship can sometimes feel painstakingly constructed. They are, quite literally, made for each other, which weighs down rather than frees the story in which they find themselves. Their interactions with the troubled, prickly Van Houten also lose some impact in the move away from the page, where his words, ideas and general depravity can take fuller form. In the film, Dafoe ensures that Van Houten remains tough to like, but the character's rougher edges are sanded away in a half-hearted bid for redemption.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the film - which lifts entire lines and scenes wholesale from Green's text - triumphs and suffers where the book does. The relationship between Hazel and Augustus, when stripped to its core, is a heart-breaking/warming account of a soul-deep connection that matters all the more for its tragic brevity. There's a lot of welcome, saddening depth in the film, too, about the everyday heroism of children being forced to live on the brink of death everyday. But this is also a deliberately manipulative tale, one that hinges on an awkward twist (present in both book and film) that practically dares you not to care and cry about what's going on. It's an effective tactic, for the most part, but one that doesn't earn so much as exhaust its audiences' affections."
"kez0","9","0","1","25 June 2014"," Faithful and Detailed Adaptation
","I was finally able to see The Fault in our Stars at the theater, and I was beyond pleased with the movie adaptation of a book that I thoroughly enjoyed and reread multiple times. Movie adaptations aren't always faithful or as satisfying as a book, seeing as they are understandably a different medium, and therefore different story than their book counterpart, but The Fault In Our Stars was an adaptation that I felt was complete and matched the novel by John Green very well, while also adding extra details that I felt added to the love, and life, story, of two teenagers who as asserted in the movie, are more than just their illness.<br/><br/>A basic overview rating from me: Casting/Acting- I found casting to be very well done, Shailene Woodley playing a spunky yet sensitive lead, alongside talented Ansel Elgort who played a confident, contemplative, and very romantic Augustus Waters (initially I wasn't too sure if Elgort could pull off this character, but he actually blew me away with his performance and even brought more to the character in my opinion.) I also really liked the parents, along with the fact that the teens in support group were actual cancer survivors.<br/><br/>Cinematically- Costumes were modern and typical to what one would expect to see in today's world: not too ""fashion"" conscious or anything, but added to the characters personalities. Settings were realistic, and ***SPOILER*** Amsterdam was beautifully portrayed (a favorite cinematic scene of mine being the champagne scene).<br/><br/>I actually didn't cry as much as I expected- although tears were shed, just not always at the ""expected"" parts. I believe this was due to the fact that I had read the book and knew the story line well prior to seeing the thankfully similar movie. I actually cried some during the scenes between Hazel and her parents- an odd occurrence seeing that I as a teen and not a parent and would typically connect more and pay attention more to the teen characters of the story. However, the actual relationship between Hazel and her parents is swayed based upon how a person reads the book, and in the film the actors portrayal of parent-child relationship was a lot more poignant for me because of actually visually seeing their emotions and actions.<br/><br/>Seeing the film, however, added to my understanding and love of the story. Many visual details and connections could be made through this medium of storytelling that wasn't always as noticeable or possible in print.<br/><br/>****MOVIE SPOILERS BELOW, EVEN IF YOU READ THE BOOK*** The Eulogy scene in the church had me crying- partly for Hazel's speech, but mostly when I saw Gus cry. From the book, and also his comment later, I knew that his tearful reaction was because he was picturing the world without him and Hazel Grace not being together, which he affirmed in his eulogy for Hazel. It was heartbreaking for me to watch some of the anguish a young person has to knowing his time, and subsequent world, is limited.<br/><br/>As soon as Birdy's ""Not About Angels"" began, the tissues came out of my purse yet again. The connections and implications of this song brought out even more emotion due to its direct lyric connection to Gus's questions on Hazel's beliefs at the restaurant in Amsterdam (""What about God?"" her answer being no, along with answers saying she doesn't believe in angels, but she's unsure in an afterlife). In that scene at the restaurant, Hazel states she doesn't believe in angels, but now that Gus has passed, she is considering the question again: ""What about angels?"". Does she know have faith that Gus could be an angel watching over her? <br/><br/>From every angle, I believe there is a perspective and emotion that every person in the audience is capable of finding in this movie despite its label as a young adult book adaptation. Even though it is a story involving cancer, it does have many cute, romantic, and even funny scenes and dialogue. Parts of this movie will be difficult to watch though: it is a story about two teens suffering from a world of cancer, of course. But in the words of John Green in TFIOS, ""Sometimes, you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book."" (or in this case, movie). But don't for a second think this movie is only about cancer; it is about life."

","I quite liked this movie. The acting was great. It was funny,sad and sweet all in one. I loved that all the characters felt very real. The movie can be very tense at times.Hazel and Gus are a very believable couple and they do not just hop into bed either,it takes awhile for them to get there. One of the best parts of the movie though was the portrayal of Hazel's parents. They were loving and supportive,one of the best parents I have seen in a movie! In fact the only fight they really have is because Hazel (as a only child) is worried what will happen when they she dies and they no longer have a child to look after.This is a beautiful film and life and love."
"judyjholland","8","0","1","25 June 2014"," Great Performances But A Bit Sappy (Scene Set Up, No True Spoilers)
","I was one of those people who had read the book before seeing the film. Unfortunately, when readers read a good book, they can use their imagination and create whatever visual they want in their heads and it takes that book and story and makes it wonderful for them. Whenever the movie version is made, the director knows people have high expectations and has to make the characters from the book come alive and be utterly believable. I am NOT a fan of Woodley. She is overexposed and like Lawrence or Stewart, keeps appearing in too many movies back to back, BUT......she was excellent in this role. How difficult to have Ansel play your brother in the movie Divergent only weeks before, then have the guy appear on the screen as your love interest next. This is the stuff that makes me crazy about Hollywood. The same people appear too often. With that being said, they both portrayed the ill teens in an excellent manner. Laura Dern was a bit over the top for me and too sappy. I love Trammel and thought he was in the background too much. The first half of the movie seemed too slow and draggy for me, but then I also knew what was coming so I stuck with it. It's the last half of the film that grabs the audience. The moment he takes Hazel outside and sits on that park bench in Amsterdam. THEN, the movie gets good. If there aren't at least a couple of Oscar nods on this, I'll be surprised because the film deserves them. Some reviewers didn't like the music that would swell up during certain scenes but I actually didn't notice the music which is a good sign that the film has you in its grip. 8 out of 10 for me, only because of the slow first 45 mins in the beginning and some truly sappy moments."
"bdl7431","7","0","2","24 June 2014"," Largely formula but with some interesting twists
","Let's be honest with ourselves - this is a love story in the same vein as Romeo and Juliet and, well, Love Story.<br/><br/>OK - spoiler alert ahead<br/><br/>The move concerns two teenagers who are both fighting cancer. The girl - Hazel - has a cancer that is slowly destroying her lungs. The boy, Gus, lost a leg to cancer. Hazel starts out as tragic, but learns to live again by her relationship with Gus. Gus is an unusual character. He refuses to be overwhelmed by his cancer, or at least tries to make his mark on the world.<br/><br/>This is pretty much the film. It would be just another piece of mindless fluff designed for a female audience (and to be honest with you, there were about 20 women to every guy in the theater)except for the teenagers' wit. A classic line is when Gus, Hazel and a third boy, Issac (he lost both eyes to cancer) decide to egg the house of Issac's ex-girlfriend. When the mother of the girlfriend comes out, Gus announces that between the three of them they have 5 legs, 4 eyes, two pairs of working lungs and the mother had better get back in the house. <br/><br/>There is also a meeting with an author of a book that holds great significance to the teenagers. They arrange to meet him in Amsterdam. Not surprisingly, to me anyway, the guy turns out to be a total jerk. <br/><br/>Still, the film is not without some heavy handed references to living in the face of death. While in Amsterdam, the kids go to the Anne Frank museum. Obviously, Anne Frank is a teenager who faced death at a uncertain time. While in the museum, some quotes from Anne Frank that are relevant to the film are conspicuously presented. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, the film doesn't drag, thanks to the humorous bits nicely spaced into the film. It is largely formula, to be sure, although having the boy die instead of the girl was a bit of a surprise. So while it is good, it really is not anything spectacularly special either."

I thought I would be disappointed because sometimes movie adaptations can go horribly wrong, take The Mortal Instruments for example. <br/><br/>I was so happy when I heard there was going to be a movie out, like finally this story is coming to life and everyone can see how amazing all these characters in the book are! It was so beautifully done, the way the music fit in every perfect scene and each of the cast played their role so beautifully and perfectly. I'm so thankful for Shai, Nat, Ansel for playing the main roles incredibly and just taking us all on this roller-coaster ride! <br/><br/>The great thing about this movie is that you can get emotionally attached to it, the way the characters, such as Hazel, lets you in on her story and just makes you believe that you're really there witnessing it. This movie is definitely a tear jerker and it will break your heart, so be prepared! This movie was phenomenal and it was a privilege to get my heart broken again, but this time by the movie. It was done amazingly well and thank you Josh Boone for making such an amazing story come to life. <br/><br/>You can really connect with this movie and especially the characters, the way they are portrayed in this movie is just sensational and they bring such life to this story and it's so beautiful and so lovely!"

","There are so many critical reviews about this title that I shouldn't probably take my chance at doing it, since I am pretty sure that all I would have to say has already been mentioned by others, more gifted than I am at analyzing and defending their point of view from a movie- critically-at-ease perspective. The movie managed to touch me, to transport me, just as it did to so many viewers, according to what I can read here, and that's the point for me. So it is well-worth a ten. The script, the directing, the acting, they are all in harmony, just like a well-performed symphony where everything is there where it needs to be in order to get the audience well and beyond time and space. The point of my review is simply to suggest another great movie I have seen that was reminded to me by ""The Fault in Our Stars"", well, a different movie that is being so much in tune with this one, from a different perspective, of course, and that is ""Hasta La Vista"". So I would end by saying just like on the site of IMDb: if you liked ""The Fault in Our Stars"", you may also like ""Hasta La Vista"", a Flemish movie of 2011. Give it a try."
"lopezmaggivonkarma","7","0","1","22 June 2014"," ""The Fault In Our Stars"" My Modest Review
","These are films for receiving any luck. Although based on a bestseller, the story about a character affected by cancer should not receive much attention in cinema considering the invasion on TV about this kind of telefilms. But nevertheless took the Box Office arriving at 1st place and temporarily blurring the attention of ""Maleficent"" on the public. But it would not be big news if it were not also surrounded by laudatory reviews in specialized media Journalism<br/><br/>And truth, ""The Fault In Our Stars"" feels like a TV movie but more budget. Follow the outline of a TV movie, with characters who are collaterally developed (only get voice and presence when sharing scene with any of the protagonists), and characters which we see for a moment and then not see them again during a considerable time, which is a symptom of direct-to-DVD films which are poorly edited or unprepared (eg ""Lol"" featured Miley Cyrus). That's why (warning: little Spoilers in the next sentence) the appearance of Willem Dafoe in the funeral is meaningless, and the meeting between Shailene Woodley and Nat Wolff in the end has no coherence, since they are not strictly friends but their friendship is only appearance maintained by the link gave by Ansel Elgort; then only serves as a Deus Ex Machina to Wolff advise about the letter. The worst punished is Sam Trammell, who not only has little presence but even his acting is not convincing, looking more like a adult friend than a father. But what really superfluous are the flashbacks of the protagonist as a child, which are completely standard and could have been omitted<br/><br/>The problem of ""The Fault In Our Stars"" is not to follow the steps of a television drama. Here's Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort, in a truly bizarre turn of events have gone from being brothers in the hit ""Divergent"" to be dating in this film; although there are not too creepy innuendos that could emphasize this Pseudo-incest? And in case of Woodley, her performance is not just good but brilliant; what is even more remarkable considering her poor performance in ""Divergent"". Elgort is pretty good but pales in dramatic moments and must contend with an overly indulgent script<br/><br/>And is that part of the errors is the script focused over Elgort, incurring in the vices of the new Hollywood cinema. Apparently, there is now a very strong belief in business where the adolescents should be very confident and loving for the public to sympathize with them. While the interpretation and charisma of Ansel Elgort do not bother, the script is so desperate to make him a lovable character who flooded in a sea of â€‹â€‹improbability. Of course, as soon as he meets the girl, Elgort does not remove the look in her, and even the first day invited to his house where she accepts the invitation (Who said that a woman is difficult to conquer?). Not only do these exaggerated first steps, but some improbable nonsense for a teenager like lending a friend trophies to destroy them or the cigarette metaphor, which is good in theory but in practice is shameful. Moreover, in any case, would be fine the nonsense about the cigarette within the protagonists circle, but the desperate script does not conform and decides to cross barriers: so, they tell the cigarette metaphor to a stewardess (as if the stewardess mattered actually she does not care)<br/><br/>This review continues on my personal Tumblr (Reviews and the city tumblr), which has no commercial purpose now"
"az95","7","0","1","22 June 2014"," The Fault, Dear Brutus, is not in our Stars, but in this Film Adaptation
","I'm not exactly sure how I feel about The Fault in our Stars' film adaptation. On one hand, I thought the casting was perfect (especially Gus and Issac), and I loved that the movie remained completely true to the novel, but on the other hand, the movie didn't really resemble the novel at all. Never would I willingly read a book or watch a movie about a romance between two teenagers with cancer--the whole concept just reeks of cheap sentimentality. But I read TFIOS because I was familiar with John Green's work and I knew that his take on cancer wouldn't be your average, clichÃ©d cancer story--and of course, it wasn't. For all its pretentious, unrealistic dialogue and overcrowded metaphors, the book managed to turn a clichÃ©d concept into a witty, cynical, but ultimately hopeful story that evoked Sisyphus (hence the hamster in An Imperial Affliction being named after the mythological figure): cancer was Hazel and Augustus' rock, but it was their rock, and they made the best of it. The point Green makes in the novel is that Shakespeare's notion that ""the fault...is not in the stars, but in ourselves,"" is pretty much BS. The fault IS in our stars, in a seemingly random, chaotic universe that hands out cancer to undeserving kids.<br/><br/>I didn't get that depth from the movie at all. While I enjoyed watching Hazel fall in love with Gus slowly, the movie went down hill when she fell in love with him ""all at once."" The film suddenly turned into what Hazel's voice-over kept insisting it wasn't: a gooey, tragic cancer story. The trouble is that I don't know how the script or direction could have been altered to give the movie the book's poignancy. Like I said, it was completely true to the novel. Maybe they could have made Hazel's mom less of a horribly stereotypical mom (she was the worst part of the film, in my opinion). Maybe, just as Hazel can't breathe without her oxygen tank, John Green's story simply can't thrive without his prose."

It's also my favourite book of all time. And I'm going to say something about this film that I rarely say about book-to-screen adaptations. This film really done the book justice. Ansel Elgort was perfect as Augustus, and Shailene Woodley was perfect as Hazel. They kept all the best parts in the book, and while they could've, they didn't reduce it to some rubbish chick-flick. The beauty and the integrity of the book was there in the film and any fan of the book will be pleased with this film. I strongly recommend it whether you read the book or not."
"Yesh4","7","0","1","22 June 2014"," Not bad but over-hyped
","I was so excited to see this movie and I do love sad movies but I didn't like something about this movie. Like when I normally watch a sad movie I feel depressed and will think about it for a while but I just didn't think too much about this because it was too depressing. It laid it on waaay too thick; it did not need to be that depressing I didn't see the point. But the movie was smoothly engineered to make the audience sob uncontrollably and yes it achieved it for most people. Literally you could hear the whole theatre sobbing, I think I was the only one that wasn't crying but I never do anyway.<br/><br/>Acting by Shailene Woodley and the people who played her parents and the guy Isaac was really good too. Some parts were really funny as well, surprisingly. And it was filmed really well, in terms of how it all looked.<br/><br/>Overall, it's worth a watch to see what the hype's about but it is overlong, pretentious dialogue, depressing, great acting(a lot of crying in to the camera-type shots),often funny, very saccharine and predictable(even though I had not read the book). Personally, although it was not bad,I would definitely never see it again."
"filippobrancaleoni","8","0","3","22 June 2014"," Sugar-coated: the book is way more sad. Great adaptation anyway.
","I know a lot of people don't like book/movie comparison but I am sorry and here you go. The Fault in Our Stars is a very good movie adaptation of the book with the same name. I quite enjoyed the movie and I really appreciated some details and effort in the production: the V for Vendetta poster in Gus' room, Hazel's Chuck Tailors in Amsterdam and the almost-the-same-as-book dialogues. I liked the actors, particularly Van Hauten, portrayed by the amazing Willem Dafoe. Definitely the good details overwhelm some cringe-worthy things, like Hazel's room: terminal ill kid that need a O2 bottle everywhere she goes, gets tired super quickly, need elevators to get around in buildings (the Anna Frank scene underline how big of a deal was for her) and then you put her room on a top of some STAIRS under the roof? Seriously? The movie until Amsterdam was almost flawless adapted. When it came to the last part of the movie, I was kinda sad with some choices. I understand that they wanted this movie to be liked by a very young kind of public but I kinda preferred the much more adult approach of the book. I didn't like the death approach: in the movie it's too light taken, it's not spoken enough, is not conscious enough and the character of Hazel it's too much joyful. The illness of Gus is too simple, it's not enough dramatic and it's way, way to fast. In the book the whole part of Gus dying is a 4-5 chapters heart-breaking marathon: his physical along with his personality deterioration is slow, painful, inevitable, hard to read. His mind suffers from the cancer as his body, and it is shown to us by the powerless and in-love Hazel. Gus in the movie was looking too sharp, too brilliant and too much in a good shape till the end. A lot of powerful and heart-breaking scenes are missing from the adaptation. I am unsure if rate 7 or 8. I might change my rating later on. Said this I still think it's a very good movie and I think anyone should watch it, but most importantly: READ THE BOOK."
"howard.schumann","9","0","4","21 June 2014"," A poignant character study
","Now the top grossing film in the U.S., The Fault in Our Stars, Josh Boone's drama of cancer-stricken teenagers can be overtly manipulative and traverses a thin line between honest sentiment and maudlin sentimentality, yet it succeeds where others have failed because of the authentic emotion generated by its lead actors, Shailene Woodley (The Descendants, The Spectacular Now) and newcomer Ansel Elgort, who display a rare chemistry together. Based on the best-selling novel by John Green and adapted for the screen by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, on the surface the film is about cancer but is, in reality, more a poignant character study of the thoughts, feelings, and connections that teenagers make with each other and the world. <br/><br/>Told from her point of view, 17-year-old Hazel Grace Lancaster has had thyroid cancer since she was thirteen. Because her lungs are prone to filling with fluid and interfere with her ability to breathe, she has to carry an oxygen tank with her at all times. Hazel is mature for her age and, in Woodley's remarkably expressive performance, conveys a nuanced emotional range running from a resigned cynicism to a witty commentator on life but always with an innocence and intelligence. In a voice-over that begins the film, Hazel tells us that ""this isn't just a movie, it is the truth, sorry."" <br/><br/>It is a bold claim that, in spite of the filmmaker's sincere attempt, does not always live up to its promise and there are as many false notes and genre clichÃ©s as there are moments of lived-in reality. Concerned about their daughter's depression, Hazel's mom Frannie (Laura Dern) and dad Michael (Sam Trammell) encourage her to go to a cancer support group at the local church. When her mother tells her that she knows that depression is a side effect of cancer, Hazel jumps in and says her ""depression is not a side effect of cancer. It's a side effect of dying."" This oh, so clever remark might seem pretentiously literary coming from someone else, but when Woodley says it, it feels just right. <br/><br/>Hazel reluctantly attends the support group and shares her observations with other cancer survivors but one in particular catches her attention, a tall, good-looking boy of eighteen named Augustus (Elgort), whose battle with cancer has left him with a prosthetic leg. Gus radiates charm and sincerity and tells the group that he is there only to support his friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) who is in danger of losing both eyes to cancer. Both Hazel (he calls her Hazel Grace) and Gus relate to each other in a thoughtful way and even the most potentially awkward dialogue comes across as natural. When he tells her that she is beautiful and later when he looks in her eyes and tells her how much he loves her, it sounds deeply felt and authentic. <br/><br/>The two talk about their favorite books and what their life is about and the imminent spectre they face of an early death. He tells her that he plans for his life to have a meaning that will remembered through the ages to which she reminds him that there will come a time when none of us on the planet will be remembered. Hazel says that her favorite book is An Imperial Affliction, a novel about a young person with cancer which he agrees to read but is dismayed by the fact that the book ends in mid-sentence. They send each other text messages, and their affection for each other grows exponentially until Hazel decides they should be ""just friends."" <br/><br/>She tells Gus that she is keeping her distance because she is ""a grenade likely to explode and wants to minimize the casualties,"" but Gus has fallen in love with her and is not about to let go, whatever the consequences. He invites her to go to Amsterdam with her to meet the author of the book, Peter van Houten (Willem DaFoe), to ask him what happens to the other characters after his book ends. Their trip to Amsterdam to meet van Houten, however, though beautifully photographed by cinematographer Ben Richardson, turns into a near disaster, though it ultimately serves to bring them closer together.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the entire middle episode feels leaden, highly improbable, and incongruous with the tone of the rest of the film. Hazel and Gus' subsequent visit to Anne Frank's house, while well done, also does not ring true. If the ending is predictable, the tears it evokes are earned because we care deeply about the characters we have come to know and identify with. Author Washington Irving observed that ""There is sacredness in tears. They are not the mark of weakness, but of power. They speak more eloquently than ten thousand tongues."" If that assessment is valid, then The Fault in Our Stars, for all its flaws, is the most eloquent film of the year."

However, I do appreciate the refreshing writing of Mr. John Green, because he delivered a wonderful book to millions of shelves, and wonderful words scanned millions of eyes. The Fault In Our Stars is heartfelt and beautiful! It is one movie I've seen sticking true to the book and with that being said I only have minor complaints of things that were altered in the movie: 1. That funny scene with Issac and Hazel in the hospital. 2. The swing set ad, which may come across as a movie mistake because it was never mentioned and gone at the end of the movie. 3. The ambulance passing in the gas station scene. 4. Eating outside in Amsterdam 5. The argument with Gus and his parents. 6. Kaitlyn. 7. Gus's family 8. The whole ANTM obsession. 9. Gus's ex girlfriend There's more but I wont ramble on, I get it, things have to be altered. This is such a phenomenal book and movie. I love it! You will too. Don't forget..

","I've seen many book adaptations; Harry Potter, Watership Down, Secret Life of Bees, Perks, Scott Pilgrim, etc. I've never hated a film adaptation of a novel which I've cherished (save for Percy Jackson - why, Chris Columbus, why?!)Despite having liked each book adaptation I've seen in their own unique way, The Fault in Our Stars (aka TFiOS), has to be the best adaptation of them all.<br/><br/>Almost everything about this film is perfect. Ansel and Shailene brought my favourite literary characters to life in a manner no other actors ever could. They ARE Hazel and Gus. I particularly loved Ansel; he captured Gus's character perfectly, he was the exact Gus of my mind. As another member on the IMDb board mentioned, he even seemed to act a little like John Green - eccentric and giddy, yet reserved. After all, John did create Gus, it's natural there'd be a bit of his essence within him. Some critics have been unfair in re Gus's character, with IGN calling him a manic pixie dreamboy. That he is not, at least not to me. Ansel played the part so well, capturing every side of Gus. It was as if Gus walked straight off the page and in front of the camera.<br/><br/>Shai was amazing as Hazel. She portrayed her extremely well - she kept Hazel true to her form, that being she was humble yet elevated, positive yet realistic, grounded yet not without fantasy. Shai captured Hazel's mature stature, her girlish charm and her witty personality, all while treating her hamartia with respect, with her fear of exploding bubbling in her eyes right under the surface.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe surprised me. I thought he was going to be a terrible Van Houten. He was not. Dafoe was Van Houten as Elgort was Gus. He was incredible. Van Houten, if you've read the book, is a right a$$hole, but he does extract sympathy, and Dafoe brings both the bitter, mean-spirited drunk and the sorrowful, depressed man who's lost his way right to the table. Dafoe captured Green's semi-antagonist an in a way I never thought he could. I regret doubting him.<br/><br/>Laura Dern was lovely as Mrs Lancaster, and Nat Woolf was hilarious as Isaac. I wish ol' Isaac had more screen time, and that his bond with Hazel was deepened a little. He had the best one liners; the whole trio did. The only disappointment, to me, was Sam Trammell as Mr Lancaster. He seemed very underdeveloped and his character didn't have many lines. It was a shame, since himself and Hazel had a great old repore in the book.<br/><br/>Some things from the novel are omitted, of course, others added. All in all it's the most faithful adaptation I've ever seen. Faithful in the sense that not only is it loyal to the source material, but it captures the message, themes and spirit of the book in ways that I've never thought possible in a film adaptation. You can sense John Green's eccentric yet humble personality oozing from the characters, the core message of the film is not lost in translation. The actors and filmmakers put their blood, sweat and tears into this production in order to transform a beloved book from print to film reel without anything vital being lost in the process. They've succeeded, in my book.<br/><br/>This is the definitive TFiOS. It was a privilege to have my heart broken by this film, and I look forward to it doing so many more times in the near and distant future.<br/><br/>Okay? Okay. :)"

"TheConnoisseurReviews","8","0","3","10 June 2014"," An emotional ride that celebrates life
","""The Fault In Our Stars"" is an incredible ride of emotion from start to finish. It's a touching love story that really pulls on the heartstrings and manages to make prolific statements on life and what we as humans should do with such an amazing gift. That we are not bound by the life we are given and we can do whatever we want so as long as we don't let our circumstances bind us.<br/><br/>I am really impressed by this films script and how thought provoking and heartfelt it is. The relationship and the genuine emotions are so well written that not for a second I don't believe what they are saying or feeling towards one another. I also enjoy how it doesn't take a strong sentimental or sappy approach on the subject matter, as these characters are really sick and it could have come off as trying way too hard or manipulative. The script instead focuses on celebrating life as apposed to the darker side of death.<br/><br/>The director, Josh Boone, does a good job with handling everything that is going on and directs the cast well, as they are the strongest parts of the film. I really enjoy some of the stylistic approaches in the film, such as how they show the text messages. One small fault in his directing is that the film gets a bit conventional near the end and it manages to lose some of its magic. The soundtrack is well used and really drives the movie home. It's filled with upbeat and fun songs that really makes the film feel like a celebration of life.<br/><br/>The cast is top class and they truly give some wonderful performances. Shailene Woodley gives a magical performance that conveys genuine happiness and heartbreaking sadness. She easily portrays so many emotions realistically and convincingly. Ansel Elgort plays Woodley's love interest and if not done by such a good actor, he could have come off as annoying and in your face. His character is a bit loud and egotistic, but he is a nice guy and really loves everyone, who he encounters. Woodley's and Elgort's on screen chemistry is incredibly good. I really bought their relationship and felt every pain that they felt. The actors are a true highlight of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, ""The Fault In Our Stars"" is a really good movie that is a fresh of breath air in this summer blockbuster season filled with high octane action and ridiculous special effect. It's a emotional ride that does not force it's message or manipulates its audience. It is a genuine movie that shows a brighter side of life and death. While the film does get conventional in it's third act, it still ends on a high note. I give it an incredibly high 4/5"
"mistercsays1","Null","0","3","10 June 2014"," Shailene Woodley Shines
","Shailene Woodley is so hot right now. Young adult fiction is so hot right now. Put them together and you should have a solid gold certified success, right? Well, not quite. Don't get me wrong, Woodley is terrific as cancer-stricken teenager Hazel in Josh Boone's The Fault in our Stars, the cinematic adaptation of John Green's popular YA novel of the same name, it's just that the movie doesn't always live up to the quality of her performance. Woodley wowed all and sundry with her Golden Globe-nominated performance as George Clooney's recalcitrant daughter in The Descendants and then backed up with a sparkling turn in The Spectacular Now before detouring into blockbuster territory with Divergent. With a screenplay by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber â€“ the duo responsible for writing The Spectacular Now and the excellent (500) Days of Summer â€“ The Fault in Our Stars is about real teenagers doing real things and therein lays its strength. <br/><br/>Of course, many real teenagers can be very annoying and teenage boys in particular are often cocky and self-assured to the point of being obnoxious. Gus is such a creature. Played by Ansel Elgort, who also featured in Divergent, Gus has good looks, charm and confidence in spades, all of which he uses to ingratiate himself with Hazel. The two meet in a cancer support group; he has lost a leg to the disease, while she has damaged lungs that requires her to be permanently attached to an oxygen tank. By no means a shrinking violet, Hazel is intelligent, witty and self-deprecating. She demonstrates maturity in balancing the seriousness of her situation with her desire to experience life to the fullest. Furthermore, she understands and appreciates the burden that her illness has placed on her parents, both financially and emotionally. Gus, on the other hand, is prone to make light of his circumstances and seems happy enough to grasp every advantage that comes his way as a result. Having survived a brush with osteosarcoma, perhaps Gus has every reason to embrace life to the full and can therefore be excused if he occasionally comes across as a bit too glib about his experience and what it has cost him (such as when he allows his friend Isaac to smash the basketball trophies that adorn his room). His so-called metaphor though, which consists of an unlit cigarette dangling from his mouth almost all of the time â€“ ""you put the thing that does the killing right between your teeth, but you never give it the power to kill you!"" - comes across as pretentious and is infuriatingly annoying. <br/><br/>The duo bond over vocabulary, Venn diagrams and literature, but it is their mutual love of a novel titled An Imperial Affliction that seals the deal. The story resonates with them through their shared experience with the central character, but they are frustrated by the ending and set out to contact the author in search of answers. Gus cashes in on the benevolence of an organisation akin to Australia's Make-A-Wish Foundation to enable him and Hazel to meet Peter Van Houten (Willem Dafoe), the author of An Imperial Affliction, who is living in self-imposed exile in Amsterdam. However, Van Houten is a bitter man with no interest in indulging these two young people in their quest for answers. Dafoe is great as the rude, dismissive Van Outen and it is somewhat disappointing that, late in the piece, there is an attempt to redeem the character somewhat in the eyes of Hazel and the audience. Why do filmmakers (or authors for that matter) find it necessary to dilute the venom in such characters when they are almost always more interesting and believable when they are at their most despicable? <br/><br/>Woodley seems much more at home in smaller-scale productions such as this which rely more on acting than acrobatics. She is a naturalistic performer who articulates the emotional roller-coaster of Hazel's experience to perfection. Whilst Elgort is serviceable as Gus, the problem lies in the character more so than the performance. Sure, Gus seems like the type of boy you would want your daughter to bring home, but he is just too good to be true. Laura Dern and True Blood's Sam Trammell are fine as Hazel's parents, while Nat Wolff provides comic relief as Isaac, a fellow cancer patient who is more upset at losing his girlfriend than he is about losing his eyesight. There is nothing showy about Boone's direction of the drama and he lets the story, which no doubt will have people reaching for tissues, play out without it ever becoming manipulative or overly melodramatic."

THE FAULT IN OUR STARS teaches us that, ""There's no ""I"" in cancer,"" at least when it strikes youths of a certain age. These sufferers spend most of their time kissing each other because, unlike adult victims of the disease, they never have ""cancer breath."" The constant sniffling from the young audience surrounding me prove that it is very sad when young Americans glowing with the pink of health actually are dying of cancer, even though they get to go to Disney World AND Amsterdam. Of course, for every ONE fatally stricken U.S. cancer youth there must be a hundred or a thousand more youthful Africans and Asian lives snuffed out (by Ebola, AIDS, war, and starvation) with a degree of ""oblivion"" unimaginable to FAULT lovers Gus and Hazel.

"ethelgracekeebobis","7","0","3","9 June 2014"," The Fault in Our Stars is a modern-day fairytale whose characters struggle through a deadly but captivating journey
","John Green.<br/><br/>How should I start this review?<br/><br/>First and foremost, I have read the book even before the ""movie tie-in"" book was published and I have never come across John Green's books before I read this one. What captured my attention on this (which made me buy and read it) was the beauty of the cover (which was also the reason why was I addicted to The Selection series); I thought it was cute.<br/><br/>So, as the movie was announced, I got excited. I looked forward for posters, promotional videos, behind the scenes and even the official soundtrack.<br/><br/>The movie was released on the same week as of Tom Cruise's Edge of Tomorrow. I had foreseen the possibilities of it beating Edge of Tomorrow's sales on the opening weekend, and it really did! Film makers should be more careful on choosing the rivals of a film's opening week before releasing them. <br/><br/>The movie was great. I agree that this film really stayed true to the book unlike what happened to Percy Jackson (trust me, do read the book instead, if you haven't seen the film).<br/><br/>The main stars made me believe that fictional characters can have life in motion picture despite the ""imaginary"" motion picture a reader envisions from words. Both characters had delivered their lines well and gave justice to the book. Shailene was good and Ansel was simply Gus. There's nothing about him that you couldn't disagree more of the fact that he really is the perfect Gus. He's charming, cute and funny as well. I can't literally say which scene of each character is my favorite but one of the really funny ones that I can think of as this moment is the trip to Amsterdam. Ansel's Gus portrayal on the ""Oh my gosh, we're flying"" was really comical! It was one of the scenes that you would really pity the boy who'd never been in an airplane before but still feel sorry to the boy for not being able to be in an airplane before. It's a bit confusing but you'd understand when you'll see it.<br/><br/>I like how the film was mostly about Hazel and Gus, despite being the lead, important characters who I think really did own the entirety of the film's chemistry. But I was looking forward to the Isaac scenes. Unlike in the book that Isaac was often mentioned, the film featured Isaac only in the first few and last scenes. One of Isaac's best scenes is the part where he sang his lungs out after Monica broke up with him and the part where released his heartbreaking anger breaking Gus's trophies (while Gus and Hazel were talking about AIA). And one last thing about Isaac: I think it was really cute when Isaac was pronounced like ""eyesac"" sine I had always pronounced it as ""eye-suh-uck"", which I typically use referring to friends' names and the Bible character.<br/><br/>The egging scene was short but fun. I expected to have it a bit longer though. It was focused merely on Hazel and Gus despite I have imagined it to be fun as Hazel watching the bestfriends bond.<br/><br/>Patrick was well played. Like the book, he was the funny, divorced guy leading the Support Group, talking about the Heart of Jesus. But I think one of the things they missed about Patrick's character is the humor that he brings whenever he mentions the deceased Support Group members in his prayers. I think the film producers didn't think of it as important though, but I really think it was funny.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe was a good choice of Van Houten though I kind of pictured him like a proud, fat, bastard. Willem delivered Van Houten's meanness well though. Aside from Van Houten, I never thought Lidewij was pronounced as Lee-duh-vie; and I was also looking forward to seeing how big and handsome her boyfriend is because before the end of the book, she mentioned that she needed to bring her boyfriend along to check Van Houten's mail for Gus's letter. In the film, it was Van Houten himself that delivered the letter during Gus's funeral.<br/><br/>Speaking of letters, maybe it was just me or did anybody else notice that the explanation of the title wasn't mentioned? Or maybe there was just something else important that connected the film's plot to the title. Maybe.<br/><br/>Anyway, I feel bad for not really crying at the end of the film. Though there were really emotional and touching scenes that I think would be better in the film, it only made me almost drop a tear. Dropping a tear and crying aren't the same, technically. But anyway, I didn't really cry like I did in The Last Song. I'm not saying that this isn't a good film, maybe it was just because The Last Song was more about families and stuff. Another reason I suspect I didn't cry: I've been listening to the OST (and found it incredible) since it was released and this is the side effect of it.<br/><br/>Also, I think the film makers agreed to omit mentioning green jokes of Isaac and Gus, which I think isn't a big deal. They also omitted the mentioning of the real movies Gus and Hazel watched, which I think wouldn't justify why Hazel told Van Houten that she reminds her of other people (after funeral part).<br/><br/>For me, The Fault in Our Stars is a modern-day fairytale whose characters struggle through a deadly but captivating journey.<br/><br/>Then you might ask: Why a fairytale when the ""supposed"" Prince had died and there wasn't really a ""happily every after""?<br/><br/>Here's my answer: Despite all the odds, they both fought to be loved; Despite all the odds, they both fought to be cured for love; Despite all the odds, they both had their ""infinities"" and were in love.<br/><br/>Go see it!"

I would honestly rate it more if I possibly could. From the second the movie started, I was sucked into the world of Hazel Grace Lancaster. Although the overall plot may sound just sad, I can honestly tell you that I and everyone in the theater laughed sooo hard at every joke that was included in the movie. Every moment was on point. Tears were everywhere by the end. It was amazing. It was perfection. I loved how it ended because they didn't leave us hanging at a depressing spot, but a happy one.

","All too often, I see melodramatic cancer movies (i.e. MY SISTER'S KEEPER) that try so hard to make you cry and just relieve the target audience of the book. So many of these films along with the other horrible love stories eventually become the same level of cheese as anything you'd see on the Hallmark channel you watch to get a few laughs in your days. But in THE FAULT IN OUR STARS (FIOS), it may be the sense of self- awareness it has, or the beautifully crafted characters, director Josh Boone finds a way to make a genre- defying love story that will undoubtedly stand the test of time.<br/><br/>Hazel Grace Lancaster, presented in the Oscar-worthy performance by Shailene Woodley, has established herself in the beginning as a cancer patient who has long since come out of the acceptance stage of dying and transformed into the waiting stage, which makes for an extremely interesting and immersive character to gain a mind set. Never has a simple love story delved into such raw human emotion and been so genuine in presenting true human thought process. When Hazel is introduced to Agustus Waters, played by Ansel Elgort, she is given a ""little infinity"" that blows any charming a man has ever done to a woman in a movie. A series of events happen, and a depressing final act ensues, but for some reason, you come out of the theater feeling refreshed. Relieved that is, that there is still some hope in the romantic genre, that films still know how to develop multiple-leveled characters all the while creating an iconic film still accessible to the mainstream audience.<br/><br/>The major, and only flaw, this film has is in the character Agustus. While he is very touching and genuine as the recovering cancer patient, he seems to have a tad but too much self-awareness of exactly how charming he is. I don't want to use the term cock to describe how he comes across, but in some instances, that's the only term I can describe his reactions to lines of other characters, etc. He has one scene in particular that is supposed to be sad but I couldn't help but burst out laughing from the facial expressions. But other than that, FIOS is a leap forward in the romance genre and will provide grief for all romantic films to come since they will not be able to live up to this film. GRADE: A-"
"kathy-huff65","10","0","4","8 June 2014"," Sweet tearjerker that rivals The Notebook
","Beautiful film with exceptional acting by the entire cast. Shailene Woodley should expect an Oscar nod for her performance. I was prepared to have tissues ready for this film, but I did not expect to need them throughout the entire movie. The plot, while some feel that it's already overdone, was fabulous, telling the story of cancer through the eyes of teenagers who had never really had a relationship. If you were not moved by this movie, something is seriously wrong with your moral character. It moved well over the topics of death, religion, point of view from the parents and friends and had a lot of symbolism of how it may be like to know you're terminally ill but never know when life will be over. Best money I have spent in a theater for myself and my daughters since Divergent."

The first time was after Disney's ""Frozen,"" which I saw in January. And the second time was after this film.<br/><br/>And I didn't expect it, either. I mean, sure, I knew I was gonna like it. I read John Green's novel this past winter and I did quite enjoy it. So yes, I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I thought it was gonna be good. But it wasn't just good. It was incredible. Not only was it probably the most faithful book-to-movie adaptation I've ever seen (save for those bazillion Christmas Carols), but it was one of those movies that was both heart-wrenching and heart-warming at the same time. Not many films can do that, and this one pulled it off superbly."

"RforFilm","8","0","3","8 June 2014"," The Fault in Our Stars in a cute love-sick story that's funny, sad, and satisfying a cure for a good romance.
","Nobody likes getting sick. It's unpleasant, it changes our daily routine, and we're brought down to a level in which our souls have been weakened by the disease, making us feel bad about ourselves and giving us an everlasting fear that sickness can strike at any moment. No matter how healthy we try to live, we aren't invincible and we could drop dead at any moment from something that scientists have yet to discover. That's what's troubling about the universe; the air and land we breath has so much we don't understand that were still young at fighting. <br/><br/>One such disease is cancer. This has been around forever and people to this stay still get sudden announcements from their doctor that they too have become one of millions of people with a disease they have yet to find a cure. Technology has gotten better, but most cancer victims are stuck to taking chemotherapy as a treatment, but it's no guarantee. I think that people with cancer or any other kind of sickness wants the world to know that they are regular people like us with interests, family and love. Two teenagers reveal their love-sick story in the adaption of the critically acclaimed novel, The Fault in Our Stars. <br/><br/>Hazel-Grace Lancaster (played by Shailene Woodley) is a sixteen-year-old cancer patient who has had this curse ever since she was a little girl. She has gone through many treatments and has had a couple of encounters with death. Fate has kept her alive as she struggles to live a normal teenage life. At the insistence of her parents, she attends a support group for teenagers like herself, yet doesn't find much that interests her. This changes when she gets stares from a new addition to the group, Augustus Waters (played by Ansel Elgort)<br/><br/>He has a rebellious spirit that many of the other cancer stricken teenagers lack that intrigues Hazel, yet she writes off his affections and ask that their relationship only remain friendly. As the weeks pile on, their texting sessions become longer and the two get to know each other, including Hazel's dream of meeting her favorite author, Peter Van Houten (played by William Dafoe). Augustus uses his wish from Make-A-Wish to take her and her mother to Amsterdam, where romance finally draws the two to each other. The trip goes well and they continue to prosper their relationship, until one of them hits further complications (I won't be the one to say who).<br/><br/>The Fault in Our Stars could have gone a million ways wrong from adding a dumb misunderstanding to having them instantly fall for each other right on the spot. Love stories are like horror films as few of them are any good, but this one is a very good love story. Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort have some excellent chemistry that makes them look very precious together. It's a real relationship where they're seen talking to each other about this stuff and how far is too far for this kind of love.<br/><br/>It's a rare mix of funny and sad. Just how sad is The Fault in Our Stars. It never reaches a point of phony smultz, but rather heartbreaking facts of life that our characters have no choice but to face them. I'll say that I enjoyed 50/50 a little better then The Fault in Our Stars as it is missing something that was needed; more scenes with Augustus on his own. We get a lot of scenes of Hazel watching TV or reading, but I never got more out of Augustus then that he used to play basketball and he's a rebellious amputee. The best way to describe the movie is something that I also used with Her had last year, cute. It's a cute story that I sure plenty of people are going to bring tissues with before they watch.<br/><br/>I'll give this eight and a half cityscapes of Amsterdam out of five, as both characters would have loved this. The Fault in Our Stars is a nice love story that the books fans are gonna love and will become as much of a valentines staple as 500 Days of Summer and Love Story has become."

","A couple of months back I read the Young Adult Novel ""The Fault in our Stars"" by John Green, in anticipation of the movie. It is the story of Hazel, a teenager living with cancer. At the start of the story, the cancer is seemingly terminal, but she has survived for the time being. Her mother makes her go to a support group in the basement of a Church - To get out there, live life, make friends, etc. In this support group, she meets Agustus, also a teenage cancer patient, in remission, who has an amputated leg due to his illness. The two fall in love, and I will stop there.<br/><br/>If you have not read the book or seen the movie, your mind can imagine where the story goes. I won't spoil it. For those who have read it – It is a good adaption of the book. <br/><br/>The First Half of the movie while not bad, is not perfect at times – the Second Half Shines! Shailene Woodley, has some very strong individual scenes as Hazel. She is one of the most popular younger actresses out there (lead of the ""Divirgent Franchise) and it shows why in those scenes. She is bubbly when she needs to be, and can turn serious when it's time. I think she hasn't even become the best she can be yet. Ansle Elgort's Agustus is as likable and charming as you want him to be. Laura Dern is very effective as Hazel's mother, and in his brief turn – William Dafoe is effective as Van Houten - The author of ""An Imperial Infliction"" - a book that ended with some unanswered questions, which Hazel and Agustus desire to get, prompting a desired trip to Amsterdam to meet him.<br/><br/>I know it is cliché - Suffice it to stay – If you have a heart, you will not helped but be moved – And you don't have to have read the book. 3 ½ out of 4 Stars!"
"moviexclusive","8","0","3","8 June 2014"," Bring tissues. A lot of them. This is one smart, witty, and edgy romance that, we warn you, ends in genuinely bittersweet tragedy
","Kudos to John Green for proving that popular young adult fiction need not always be set in dystopia (think 'Divergent' or 'The Hunger Games') or the supernatural (need we mention 'Twilight'); rather, his bestselling novel is a love story between two witty, engaging teenagers with cancer, and before you go thinking that this is no more than Nicholas Sparks for a younger crowd, trust us when we say that it is nowhere near that. Instead, as those who have read the book will stridently attest, it is wise, warm, funny and touching all at the same time, and the best thing one could say about this film adaptation is that it retains all these qualities which made the book such a sensation.<br/><br/>Going into a story like this, you know that it is bound to turn mawkish at some point, especially as it deals with the inevitable progression towards death of not one but both of our endearing protagonists. What makes Green's novel - and by extension, Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber's screenplay - such a winner is just how it earns each and every drop of your sympathies for the two leads, Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) and Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), so much so that when it does play that tug at your heartstrings, you'll not begrudge for every tear you shed. And oh yes, unless you're defective (and we say this with not a single hint of spite), you'll be moved to tears by this story of dying love.<br/><br/>Preserving Hazel's narration of the events that follow (and clearly benefiting from the strength of Green's prose), our first encounter with Hazel is through the thoughts in her head. As a teen, she came perilously close to death, but an experimental treatment has managed to beat back the cancer, and so she goes around these days with a tube inserted into her nostrils that's tethered to an oxygen tank she lugs around in a trolley bag. It is at a support group for cancer patients that she has her 'meet-cute' with the strappingly handsome Augustus, a basketball player whose career was cut short when cancer took his right leg and where a metal support now resides.<br/><br/>Both are immediately taken to each other, and it's not hard to see why. Not only do they match each other in intelligence, they are just as whip-smart, making an instant connection as they trade barbs with each other - and yes, in case there was ever any doubt, fall in love. Most prominently, they bond over their rejection of the usual 'cancer story' sentiments', finding much to talk about in Hazel's favourite book 'An Imperial Affliction' by the reclusive Dutch-American author Peter Van Houten, which just happens to be about living with cancer. Hazel counts herself as Van Houten's biggest fan, so Augustus takes a chance and tries to reach out to Van Houten himself, who unexpectedly replies to the latter's fan mail.<br/><br/>One thing leads to another, and pretty soon Hazel and Augustus are travelling to Amsterdam to meet Van Houten (Willem Dafoe) in person - better still that it is an all-expenses paid trip sponsored by Augustus' Make-A-Wish type foundation. We won't spoil the surprise for those unacquainted with the story, but suffice to say that the trip marks a turning point in their relationship not only because it deepens their personal affections but also in how it gives them an unexpected lens by which to re-examine how they have come to terms with their condition. It is a sobering turn of events no doubt, and even more so when you consider on hindsight what happens after.<br/><br/>Does one or both of them die at the end? Well, certainly. Death is pretty much written into a story like this, so in that sense, it is still an unabashed tearjerker. What differentiates this from the rest of the sappy melodramas is its refreshing sense of honesty about the real- life issues it confronts. Yes, it doesn't sugarcoat the realities it wades into - the disease, mortality, and the impermanence of our temporary existence on this earth - and instead deals with them with insight and self-deprecating humour; in particular, the recurring theme of oblivion makes for a heartbreaking moral search by one of our protagonists to find meaning in suffering.<br/><br/>To his credit, director Josh Boone handles the material with sensitivity and restraint, but he doesn't add much to the cinematic language that Green's book was already brimming with. Instead, the real stars here are Woodley and Elgort, who embody the amazing chemistry which Green describes between Hazel and Augustus. This is easily Woodley's standout role, bringing just the right mix of strength and vulnerability, resistance and acceptance, to make Hazel a living and breathing character that invites her audience to feel her struggle and share in her fate. Her 'Divergent' co-star Elgort is confident but stops short of ever becoming cocky, but most importantly makes for an extremely appealing couple with Woodley.<br/><br/>The best assurance we can offer to fans of the book is that it remains faithful to Green's tale, and by that we mean it is equally sharp, funny, and well-observed. It is also a weepie all right, but one that earns its emotional kick with wit and earnestness. At no point does it ask for any pity from its audience; instead, it regards its characters with the respect and dignity that they deserve, acknowledging their everyday struggles and the uncertainties that the disease has on their relationship. It's not always you get a cancer picture that you get characters saying lines like 'pain demands to be felt' or 'life isn't a wish-granting honesty', but that is also the reason why 'The Fault in Our Stars' rises above the trappings of its genre to become something exuberant, perceptive and genuinely stirring."

","I read The Fault in Our Stars about 2 years ago and had not revisited the book before seeing the movie. I remember the majority of the novel and was pleasantly surprised to see that the movie stayed fairly true to the book. <br/><br/>This movie brings out every emotion. I cried (A LOT), laughed out loud, and got chills on many occasions during this movie. I think that everyone that read the book will probably cry a little bit more because you have read the book and know what to expect and what is going to happen next.<br/><br/>The actors played their roles amazingly. The personalities of both Hazel and Gus were brought out perfectly through every scene. Not one scene seemed forced or awkward. The scenes connected smoothly and made this movie seem like real life. I felt as though I were watching the life of Hazel Grace unfold as if it were a true story. <br/><br/>Everything was perfect about this movie. Definitely the best movie I have seen this year! The emotions and wonderful quotes from John Green's book were all there. I couldn't have asked for a better adaptation from the novel. What a beautifully made movie. I want to see it again right now! And you all should see it too. 10 out of 10!"

","As someone who loves books and reading, I'm not sure whether I should be excited or worried when a book gets made into a movie. Sometimes the movies don't live up to the fans' of the books expectations and never does the book the justice that it deserves. When you're reading you create a picture of what you think the characters and scenes in the book should look like and when you see it on screen you can either be disappointed or happy with how it turned out. <br/><br/>I'm always bad at describing movies to others because how do you say The Fault in Our Stars is a romantic comedy about two teenagers who have cancer fall in love without it sounding like it could be another sappy love story? But, the truth is, The Fault in Our Stars really isn't another sappy love story at all. This is the type of book/movie that will make you want to read/watch it over and over again and share with as many people as you can so they can enjoy it as much as you did. <br/><br/>Not to my surprise, this movie was wonderful. The movie completely did the book justice and followed it in the way I thought it would. I was happy to find that many of my favorite quotes from the book were included in the movie. I definitely cried while reading this book, so I was prepared when I saw the movie. But, being prepared really didn't help in the end, considering the fact that I was almost crying before the movie actually started. <br/><br/>Shailene Woodley and Ansel Elgort had amazing chemistry throughout the movie and I really believed that they were Hazel and Augustus. My favorite kind of movies are the ones that make you just sit there and think about them after they have ended. This was one of them. To me, this isn't a movie that you watch then continue on with your day. This is the kind of movie/book that will stick with you for a very long time and you will come back and think about it over and over again. <br/><br/>Even though I would recommend on reading the book first, this is a truly beautiful film that will make you laugh and break your heart at the same time, and you will still love it. <br/><br/>""I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once."""
"rgkarim","9","0","3","7 June 2014"," There is Very Little Fault With This Movie
","Movies about terminal illness, so passionate, so well done, but somehow so sad. Yet for some reason we are drawn to them like moths to a flame, often for the quality tales they spin, and the emotions they stir up. This week The Fault in Our Stars released, another movie based on, yes you guessed it a book. So naturally after coming off my latest science fiction high, it was time for me to return to my local theater and calm myself with this drama/romantic tale. What did I think? As always, please read on to find out. <br/><br/>For those who haven't seen the plethora of trailers, or read the book, this movie is the story of Hazel (Shailene Woodley) a girl who suffers from cancer and the associated depression that follows. Just when everything seems lost, a charismatic man named Gus(Ansel Elgort) enters, whose positive outlook and bright spirits send them on a journey of self discovery and wonder. I know, the story sounds like all the other terminally ill stories, but that doesn't mean it's not worth checking out. The Fault in our Stars is an incredibly passionate movie, filled to the brim with amazing scenes of beauty, wonder, and emotion. <br/><br/>It all starts with the characters, who at first are like yin and yang, opposite approaches to the same situation. Woodley's portrayal of Hazel was fantastic, the dismay and depression flowing out of her so naturally, it was as if she herself was suffering from the disease. It was so refreshing to see her not playing an overly whiney, teenager as I've seen in her past roles, instead showing the true abilities she had beneath. Yet the character that really brought the movie to me was Gus. This man's positivity and will were infectious, brightening up the negative energy of the situation and keeping the movie fun despite the dire outcomes that awaited. Elgort was like a low key Jesse Eisenberg, arrogant, but not as much of a jerk that makes him lovable. The characters are strong on their own, but together they evolve into a duo that breathes so much life into the movie and hooks you into the two-hour ride. Even when they are not speaking, these young actors portray their feelings in simple gestures, an eye roll here, a smirk there, that translates the thoughts going on in their minds.<br/><br/>Supporting the characters is a some creative dialog, that was synthesized from a variety of styles to help get the point across. At first it is nothing more than the ire filled thoughts of a cancer patient that reflects the suffering they face. Depression eventually turns into casual conversations when Gus arrives, balanced in comedy, romance, and other emotions that continue to shift as the story unfolds. What could be a laugh fest at one point can turn into a sobfest at another, but one thing that holds constant is the realism of the movie. Unlike some movies, there is no magical word, saying, or moment that erases all the hurt, but instead a realist approach to handling the cards life deals you. I for one can learn a thing or two from what this movie preached, and perhaps if you open your eyes you can see it too. <br/><br/>To help sell the point, the cinematography exploded with symbolism and emotion at the time of the scene. When the characters were down, the camera maximized emphasis on the face, if they were trying capture love, the scene focused on finding romantic imagery to bring out the scene. The musical score they selected only further enhanced the feelings, somehow working behind the scenes to synergistically pull at your heartstrings. You would think I would have gotten annoyed by all of this repetitive themes, but somehow they balanced all of this and kept the pace going, avoiding the cheesiness many romance movies contain in my eyes. <br/><br/>Of course what I consider cheesy, others find to be inspiring and beautiful. Being the robot I am, I did not cry in this movie, mostly because I knew what the ending would be well into the movie. Despite the lack of tears, I'll admit that the movie still moved me sending my emotions on a roller coaster ride. As for the other audience members though, the water works flowed through the entire movie. What do these observations mean? It means that you can experience a variety of emotions and learn a lot of things from this movie, which can mean multiple watches of this movie, though the tale will still remain predictable. Another warning is that there are some very tough struggles in this movie, perhaps not appropriate for those with a personal connection to this story. If you're like me though, you'll be able to find happiness in this tale, hopefully being inspired rather than depressed. <br/><br/>Surprisingly The Fault In Our Stars impressed me despite the fact it is a story I've seen before. The balance in it impresses me the most, brought to full force with the wonderful acting the cast has to bring. Yes, it is a predictable ending, but the delivery is so solid, I can't really dock it too much. I strongly recommend checking out this movie, hoping that you will take away something from the messages crammed in this movie. Those who have less control over their tears, are warned to bring tissues, or at least the supporting arm of a loved one to get you through the journey. My scores are down below:<br/><br/>Drama/Romance: 8.5 Overall: 8.5"
"JoeyCelia","9","0","3","7 June 2014"," Okay, it wasn't a bad as I thought it was going to be
","The Fault in Our Stars is a tragic love story from the beginning to the end. Going into the movie there was many questions I had...<br/><br/>Do I have to read the book?<br/><br/>Are the actors going to be awkward?<br/><br/>Is the movie going to be awkward?<br/><br/>Is it going to be like every other love story?<br/><br/>And honestly, coming from a guy who isn't really a fan of spending money to go see chick flicks... The answer to all of these questions is no. The movie was great with an outstanding amount of emotion played by all the characters. Ansel Elgort did a great job in this movie. I think he was outstanding just like Shailene Woodley. Nat Wolff as Isaac added a much needed laugh to some pretty intense scenes. This movie is filled with some pretty intense scenes. The only reason I won't give it a 10 is because it wasn't one of the best, and some of it was dragged. It was a long run time. But you know what, pretty solid movie and I would go see it. Just make sure you bring some tissues with you because things can get really sad... really quick. Okay."
"leafshadow231","10","0","4","7 June 2014"," The ""Love Story"" of 2014
","I will not spoil the movie for anyone. The movie is great for several reasons: it is a simple love story that occurs in an unexpected scenario, and emerges as the true stories of real love, where that are, with only look, feel they are known to always come up. I say it's the Love story of 2014 because it reminded me of Love Story with Ali MacGraw and Ryan O'Oneill (1970), a story of tragic love like this and it was all a success in those days. Elgort and Woodley performances was very good for a drama. I like a lot of the naturalness of both. With a budget that is a fraction of the budget of dozens of movies that are made every year, I seem to manage to create the perfect environment to frame the story. The picture is good, the acting of the kids is good, the direction is good. Willem Dafoe accomplishment that people hate him... again! Anyway, it's a drama that appeals to the reality of thousands of people suffering from cancer, that in their anonymity have the pain and anguish. Well achieved."

"andangr2424","9","0","3","7 June 2014"," In love With This Small Infinity
","Being that i very much enjoyed the book when I read it about two years a go, I was very nervous for the cast to be released. When it was, I felt that the casting choice for Hazel was appropriate. I had seen other performances by Shaliene Woodly and had admired her before her casting, however, I had never heard of Ansel Elgort and questioned his casting for the role of Augustus. After seeing the movie, I realized I should have trusted the casting directors and of course, John Green's judgment. I went into the movie expecting some over-hyped,average teenage girl movie, and what I witnessed COMPLETELY EXCEEDED my expectations by far. The casting was PERFECT, and I did not feel that the movie was a disappointment to the book, which is how I had assumed I would feel. Although I wanted to rip my heart out of my chest, and throw it on to the freeway for millions of cars to run over, the movie had some comical moments that really made you laugh out loud. It is definitely a tear-jerker, as the book was, but that is practically a given.It gave the audience a great pain, and that pain definitely demanded to be felt. There were also parts of the book that I was disappointed to see had not made the movie, like Hazel letting a young girl wear her oxygen tubes, and when Gus discusses his ex-girlfriend, however, I understood that they could not be portrayed due to strict timing. As for the movie overall, congratulations to John Green, Josh Boone, the cast, and everyone else for successfully bringing one of the greatest romance stories of all time to life. I COMPLETELY recommend and I can not wait to see this movie about twenty million more times."

","The Fault in our Stars (or Tfios), is a faithful adaptation of the book by John Green. Green was inspired to write the book after working in a hospital setting with sick children and young adults, when he was contemplating being a chaplain.<br/><br/>Tfios, like the book, shows cancer patients as your everyday person, not as just victims of misfortune. This movie had two strong lead actors portraying Augustus and Hazel.The actress who played Hazel's performance is especially memorable.<br/><br/>Though the third act dragged (as some critics agrees) a little, it was so minimal. At no point during the 2 hours+ length was this movie dull. The movie has enough comedic touches to give a delightful viewing, with also a lot of highly emotionally-charged scenes. It really shows a realistic inside view of people who live their lives with a ""foot in the grave"".<br/><br/>The love story is central. It is really incredible that these situation surely happens in real life; where two people with highly limited life spans find each other and are meant for each other, as compared to people that are healthy and live a long time that may never find or appreciate that kind of love.<br/><br/>The movie is powerful. It is hard not to be emotionally affected, and moved by it. I highly recommend it."

","I have read the book and loved it, so I automatically knew that I would have to watch the movie. I bought the early showing tickets, and when I got there I was totally unprepared. It started off beautifully. The cast was remarkable, the script was amazing. The script was quirky and funny, but with such inspirational words, left you thinking about the words over and over. The last half was more intense and very emotional (well, for me) and makes you think about the mark you leave on the world. It also makes you appreciate the life you live and to cherish the time you have, and to live life to the fullest, and delivers this message through remarkable ways. Augustus' death was very emotional, but sent out a great influence for young girls dealing with relationships. I mean, Hazel was definitely sad, but she reminded you to move on, to not grieve, and to not forget about the life ahead of you. I left the theater feeling like I had to do something, that I had to leave my mark on the world. I definitely recommend this movie (and book!!) to anybody wanting to appreciate life a little more. Hope this helped."
"dpitz","9","0","3","7 June 2014"," The world is not a wish-granting factory
","This movie is a beautiful adaptation of John Green's beautiful novel. It could be better, I admit, but it did not disappoint my great expectations about it.<br/><br/>Hazel Grace is a 17-year-old girl who was diagnosed with cancer when she was only 13. She knows that she will die soon, so she considers herself to be a ""grenade"" and thinks that her life is boring, since her routine is based on taking medical exams and watching TV series and reading (always the same book) are her best sources of fun. Like any teenager, she wants to have a normal life and friends (which she does not really seem to have).<br/><br/>Her life changes for the better after meeting Augustus Waters, a boy who also had cancer and wants to do something good with his life and not just wait for the worse to happen. They immediately fall in love and start living their own infinity, even though they know that ""some infinities are bigger than others"".<br/><br/>What I like about this story is that Hazel and Augustus accept their condition and even make fun of the ""privileges"" that they have for being sick, instead of putting themselves in a condition to make people feel sorry for them.<br/><br/>This is a touching and very, very sad movie. You will probably not be able to stop at least a few tears from falling if you watch it with an open heart."

","I have never written a review for a movie before, but this one has gotten me to do so. The movie to me was literally a roller-coaster of extreme emotions. Ups and downs. Ups and downs throughout the whole movie, and this is probably one of the best, if not the best, movies I have seen during my entire life. This is a fiction, and John Green states that before anyone reads the book, so anyone is looking for any kind of realistic feelings about realistic relationships and what not. This is not your type of movie, I can guarantee you that. However, it gave me some real, emotional feelings while watching it. For example, when Gus tells Hazel about his cancer coming back, Shailene's acting is so perfect in that scene. She leans her head on his shoulder and silently cries because she knows it's too unfair, but she also understands that cancer isn't no games. Overall, I loved it!"

","Perfect casting, perfect quoting, and adding humor at perfect places make an almost-perfect movie. Despite small detail differences(wasn't Monica's car pink in the book?), the movie follows the book's path. Go out and watch this, you won't regret it. It was everything I imagined when reading the book, if not more. If you go and see it with lots of people in the theater, expect people to be crying around you, if you're not crying yourself. This movie is beautiful because you can see the true meaning of what I'm sure John Green intended the book to show: ""The world is not a wish-granting factory"", ""Pain demands to be felt"", and ""Some infinities are better than other infinities"". And if you haven't read the book and are planning to go see the movie, it's still worth it. But you may be confused at some parts, because it follows the book pretty closely, but doesn't have as much narration, since in the book, the story is told from Hazel's perspective. In the movie, it's more objective."
"noellelizabeth12","7","0","3","6 June 2014"," A beautiful little infinity
","I was thoroughly amazed by this movie. I read the book a few months ago, knowing that a movie was being made, and fell in love with the characters. After reading the book and loving it so dearly, I couldn't wait to see how they put the movie together. When Shailene Woodley was cast, I don't deny that I was a little iffy about that decision. Her looks are perfect for the role of Hazel, but Shailene is seemingly too ""cutesy"" to play such an old soul. But I can admit that I was wrong about Shailene. She played Hazel almost perfectly. <br/><br/>There are two things I would criticize in this film. The first is minor, which was the way Hazel and Augustus met. They never bumped into each other in the book, but having to explain why Augustus stared at her for such a long time in the Literal Heart of Jesus would have taken more time and more money to film, so I understand their reasoning with that one. The second criticism I have is that Hazel was much too happy throughout the majority of the movie. Her eyes glimmered too much and she smiled much more than she had in the book. Her attitude was too positive for the role of the Hazel Grace I grew to love within the novel. Though the aspect of Augustus cheering her up as they fell in love with each other could have made her happier, it wasn't like that originally. I wanted a darker Hazel than I got. <br/><br/>Other than that, I don't have a single negative thing to say. Ansel Elgort is a dreamy one-legged Augustus and he played the part perfectly. The gas station scene was the hardest scene to watch, as he realizes that he can no longer do normal things. Watching him realize that he's dying is heartbreaking, especially after you grew to love him so deeply over the course of the film. I was in awe of the beauty of this movie and will gladly watch it again and again."

","Having read and loved the book twice, naturally I was very excited to see this film. But my initial thoughts were quite different to how I feel about it now. Of course, it is a tear-jerker. It's a cancer story, what do you expect? I was still crying after I left the cinema, trying to process what I had just seen. I loved it, but now that I've had the chance to think more critically about it, there are things that I would have done better.<br/><br/>My first impressions are often wrong and no exception was made for Ansel Elgort. I honestly was not too keen on him playing Augustus but kudos to him, he did a wonderful job. Shailene did everything I thought she would and more, she was fantastic. In fact, all the cast were great, no fault in the stars! <br/><br/>There were just some issues with the plot and things that were left out that I felt were important. I was excited to see the mall scene, where Hazel is approached by a little girl who asks what is in Hazel's nose (her cannula) but we didn't get to see that. Half of the swing set scene was missing (Paedophilic swing set seeks the butts of young children) which for some reason I was disappointed about, and the 'snow' in Amsterdam would have been visually amazing but Josh Boone decided against it. While these are all little things, being a big fan of the book it is my job to be picky about them.<br/><br/>A visual technique that I didn't enjoy was the display of text messages in the book's font. It made me feel uncomfortable for some reason, but I can understand why it was done; Hazel and Gus' texts are important in telling the story and it was an easier way of showing them, rather than constantly cutting to shots of Hazel's phone.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this film a 9/10. It has the right amount of happiness, humour and heartache. I was going to rate it an 8, but Elgort's performance pushed it up that bit further. Book-lovers, you will all love it, okay? Okay."

I went to see the movie last night and was blown away. With every movie that they adapt from a book they take things out and add things in, yet what they took out wasn't too important, (No mention of Caroline Mathers what-so-ever, they take out Kaitlyn completely, etc.) it still left a bit of disappointment. The director kept true to most dialogue between the characters so I went in and could practically quote the movie. I was impressed with all of the actors and they way the presented their characters, it truly stood true to the book. I like to believe it's so good because John Green, the author, was able to come on set and offer advice on hoe to portray all of his characters.

The story is important to me on so many levels, and as a result I was immensely nervous walking into the theater.

It did not disappoint. <br/><br/>It was noted above my review, but for those of you who haven't read the book, THERE ARE SPOILERS BELOW. <br/><br/>More than anything, the movie conveys the emotion of the book extremely well. Hazel's apathy and depression at the beginning of the book, the spark created by Augustus. The elation and disappointment from the on and off state of the trip to Amsterdam, and the absolute dread when Augustus says, ""I lit up like a Christmas tree"". It's all there, and it does all of that while being able to make you cry one moment, and burst into laughter the next just as well as the book did, or even experience both simultaneously. <br/><br/>Some scenes were cut that I would have preferred be left in, but I am happy they weren't afraid to take the film over two hours in length, if only slightly. I do look forward to seeing deleted scenes, including John's cameo, later down the road when the DVD comes out. Until then, I'll wait happily, knowing that there's one more movie out there in the exclusive club of excellent, and truly good movie adaptations of books."
"Amari-Sali","8","0","6","5 June 2014"," What surely maybe this decade's ""The Notebook.""
","I read The Fault in Our Stars years ago without any idea of it becoming as big as it would. It was simply a recommended book on Amazon and I needed something to read to keep myself from going insane due to school work. So I read chapter after chapter, finding myself so in love, and envious, of the relationship Augustus and Hazel had; hoping despite all odds there would be a happy ending amongst the infinities.<br/><br/>Characters & Story<br/><br/>Somewhere in the world there was a girl named Hazel (Shailene Woodley) who spent her time reading a book, people watching, and drowning her days in television. Then her world is shaken by this pest named Augustus (Ansel Elgort). Like her cancer he came uninvited and infected her being, finding his way in first through her eyes and mind before eventually working himself into her heart. She tries to reject his pursuit, knowing that ultimately things wouldn't end well, but after the denial that someone could find her beautiful, the short term anger which came from thinking he smokes cigarettes, came the bargaining. She would let herself be happy, and let him try his best to do so.<br/><br/>This lasts for quite some time and then depression kicks in. For as happy as they are, it doesn't take away from the fact both are cancer stricken. But there is an acceptance that they both will eventually die, but with a finite amount of time to do an infinite amount of things, why waste any moment thinking about that which is out of their control when the opportunity of love has entered their lives? Something once thought of to maybe not be an option.<br/><br/>Praise<br/><br/>One of the most difficult things when it comes to book adaptations is getting the characters right. Woodley as Hazel I admit didn't seem to fit at first, but with me seeing more and more of Woodley's work since The Secret life of the American Teenager, it is easy to see why she is quickly becoming the go to girl for films like these. As I said in Divergent, the abilities of Woodley to portray a simple character and make her into something with a heartbeat is astounding. For while arguably none of her characters seem that complex on paper, or when introduced, she pushes past that and helps us see the hope and genuine desire in each character to live a fulfilling life, making her casting as Hazel impeccable. Woodley is able to express Hazel's downtrodden nature without the shedding of tears and as jaded as Hazel is, you can see her vulnerable to the idea of being happy when Gus enters her life, and the hope he brings you can see it in every hug, kiss, and tear being like a shot of happiness she thought no make a wish foundation could ever fulfill.<br/><br/>And thankfully, while like any adaptation some things are cut or reduced, the story keeps the big moments when it comes to Gus' and Hazel's relationship which will surely put a smile on your face. For while they are a bit overly cutesy, it does remind you of the time when the concept of love wasn't tainted by past relationships or heartbreak, and it seemed like all there could be is possibilities.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>However, as I watched the film I must say that sharing the experience in a room filled with squealing young ladies really does ruin the experience. Though I could also say that it might have to do with the casting as Elgort as well. As with any film adaptation, there is the issue of what you envisioned characters to be versus what you will get with the film. And, for me, Elgort as Gus was much more arrogant and douche-like than I pictured Gus. Also, he does not have the same ability Woodley has to take a character and bring them to life. Arguably, I felt he was more so trying to charm the girls in the audience than Hazel in an effort to make himself, Elgort that is, into a heartthrob.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say as you got used to Elgort you can't be seduced by his charm, but I still had such a difficult time seeing this young man as Gus. Which leads to perhaps the biggest issue, which maybe because of me not agreeing with the casting of Elgort, and that is that despite how sad certain moments in the movie are, I didn't find myself crying surprisingly. I got teary eyed when Woodley did her thing, but for everyone else it just was this weird recognition that, yes, I am witnessing a sad moment, but the majority of the actors never fully got me to that place where I couldn't hold back my emotions. <br/><br/>Overall: Worth Seeing<br/><br/>While I have small qualms over things like casting which surely kept me from fully being immersed, though knowing what was to happen surely didn't help, this isn't to say this isn't a good movie. To me, The Fault in Our Stars has all the makings of a genuine classic for this decade, and perhaps generation. You have your usual male lead willing to do and say anything to make his love interest smile, and said love interest is a witty, smart, and sweet young woman who needs to hear, feel, and experience all the guy has to offer. Making for a film which inspires you, could make you a bit envious, and furthers your thoughts on the ideal life partner and relationship. For while Hazel and Gus' time is finite, seeing all they are willing to do for each other in these finite moments, it can potentially leave you speechless and balling in tears."

","There are film adaptations that don't even scratch the surface of the original book; there are film adaptations that blow the book so out of proportion that it isn't even about the book any more; and then there's ""The Fault in Our Stars.""<br/><br/>Having read the book prior to watching the film, I had very high expectations. Simply put, this film adaptation nails it. The screenplay doesn't copy the book word for word, but it doesn't need to. The plot, casting, setting and props are nailed to a T. And of course, as with any film adaptation, the screenplay has its own quirks but it fits so perfectly that even the most OCD of book-readers wouldn't twitch an eye over them. <br/><br/>If you've read the book, you will definitely approve of this movie. And bring a tissue box to the theatres, you're definitely going to need it. Try not to mind all the ugly sobbing you'll hear around you ;)"
"kalee-lynn-stegehuis","8","0","4","5 June 2014"," For the fan followers and everyone else too
","First and foremost, for those die hard fans out there the film does a great job of following the book. Is it just me or are filmmakers finally understanding that fan viewers really like to see the story they read visually portrayed? With that though does come some downfalls. I loved the fact that the story swayed very little from the book. But because it did so, I think the film lost some of its magic. It was less of an emotional journey as in the book readers were in the first person narrative of Hazel Grace, in the film not as much. Not just that, but there were definitely some 'pleaser lines' if you will. That is, the well-adored quotes from the book are loud and clear throughout the film, almost as if picking out the popular items from the novel and using them as items in the storyline to help sell it to the audience. It felt somewhat disconnected to me, like the story existed to tell these insights. I understand the audience will love it, but I didn't think these insights were delivered with the personality the book intended. I was surprised that the title line, the quote that identifies the reasoning behind the popular title, was left out. Unless I just missed it?<br/><br/>As for the casting, Woodley and Elgort delivered the personalities of Hazel and Augustus perfectly. Woodley had the cool and distant demeanor and Elgort did a particularly good job with his facial expressions, which were slight but delivered quite the blow. These two are going to become headlining actors after their performance in Divergent and now The Fault in Our Stars. Personally, I think both Woodley and Elgort were more suited to the roles of Hazel and Augustus than they were meant for Tris and Caleb in Divergent.<br/><br/>During the film I was most looking forward to the confrontation between Peter Van Houten and Hazel and Gus. This scene was very good! Even though Peter wasn't quite as I expected him, William DeFoe portrayed the actor with ideas I actually liked better than I originally imagined him. The scene followed as expected, but again, lost its touch of magic as we were outside Hazel's thoughts and certain things, such as Peter's assistant and the Swedish rap music, seemed underdeveloped in comparison to the novel.<br/><br/>The scene I was most impressed with actually followed the author confrontation scene. When Hazel, Gus, and Lidewij went to Anne Frank's house. Whoa! the symbolism here and Hazel's stubbornness were more dominant than what I remembered in the book. At one point the symbolism became a touch overdone, but I suppose the whole thing suited the taste of the film, following the major ideals and metaphor's of the book. Hazel's comparison to Anne Frank and their two stories, two struggles met in that house. I was impressed with the interpretations in this scene.<br/><br/>Even though I continue to say the film had less magic than the book, I understand that novel and film are two completely different mediums with two completely different ways of presenting a story. While I was grateful for the filmmakers to keep the story so close to its original script, John Green's book, I admit I wished to see a touch more interpretation. It's one thing to make the characters move and say the same things as they do in the novel, but another to make the audience feel the same way about them. Josh Boone really did a superb job directing this film, but as usual, the novel holds more emotional impact than the film was able to deliver. Of course, I still shed a tear or two. It is an emotional story after all.<br/><br/>As for the elements of film, I'm much less educated to this aspect. However, I was constantly impressed with the costumes of all the characters. Isaac's character probably surprised me the most, but it was a pleasant surprise as I realized I hadn't spent too much time creating Isaac as a character while I read. Hazel's loose, somewhat baggy, clothes suited a cancer-ridden frame of a sick child. She wore simple tees in basic, not-too-loud colors that suited her 'whatever', careful- not-to-get-too-close to anyone attitude. And Augustus wore that brown, leather jacket like a hero. It suited his athletic build – a shadow to his life before cancer, but it also reminded me of a fighter pilot, a motorcyclist, or some other action figure that perfectly suited Augustus's consistent desire for heroism.<br/><br/>While I know little about the mechanics of film, other than operating a few digital projectors at work, I really enjoyed the way this film was shot. The scenes didn't hover around the characters, but made them part of a larger picture. The images were sometimes blurred and bright – beautiful, simple, yet artistic. I don't always notice the cinematography (I hope that is the right word), but the way The Fault in Our Stars was filmed seemed another artistic filter for the story directly. It is how Hazel and Gus would have imagined it, I believe.<br/><br/>Also, the soundtrack was. amazing. There are probably about thirty seconds of film that I entirely missed (is that Ray Lamontagne? It is, I'm sure of it. Oooh! I haven't heard this song before – and so on). Again, the soundtrack was another artistic element that persuaded the film to be a touch more of John Green's beloved novel.<br/><br/>The Fault in Our Stars is a film that will please audiences whether they are John Green fans or not. It is emotional, but happy as well. You shouldn't leave sad and you won't cry uncontrollably so its probably okay for a date night movie. <br/><br/>For more, please see my original review on my blog, Rawr is for Reading - and check out other Book to Box Office Reviews"
"Matthew-WH","10","0","4","5 June 2014"," Did justice to the wonderful book by John Green.
","No movie genre makes me cry more than a movie about cancer. A Walk To Remember, My Sisters Keeper, Now is Good are a few films that destroyed me emotionally but i adore them. The book by John Green is great read and this film serves the book justice if not more so. I felt a lot more closure at the end of this film than i did reading the book. Now Is Good is so similar to this film but both stand on their own as individual films about the destruction of cancer. I think Fault In Our Stars is actually better than Now Is Good but i'd say that has a lot to do with John Green. Amazing amazing film! Broke my heart but a good movie should be able to do so. Ansel Elgort is just beautiful and so believable as the character of Gus. Shailene Woodely does a great job as Hazel too, the casting was spot on. Highly recommend this film!"
