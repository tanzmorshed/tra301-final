","I have to say, and no pun-intended: Into the Spider-Verse is a total marvel, all the way down to its stylish and diverse styles of animation to its bold, sophisticated storytelling. The visuals are absolutely enchanting. Fast, colorful, and distinct. Something Sony Animation always nails is how each character has a pronounced look and movement. With the various kinds of Spider-Men and Marvel villains featured in this story, the animators went all out to give them a unique identity. Notably in this case are Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham. Noir, whose universe takes place in 1930s New York, boasts a dark, shadowy vibe similar to Sin City, Peni Parker has a bubbly anime look, and Spider-Ham is a bouncy, eccentric cartoon character who takes full advantage of his absurd existence to deliver some of the film's best laughs. Even with these different identities, the film slows down to balance their character in a serious nature. Heck, one of the most hard-hitting, poignant lines is spoken by Spider-Ham, the breakout comedic relief.<br/><br/>Miles and a majority of characters share the same art style. I really enjoy the blend of 3D models with traditional 2D movement. It's very appealing to watch and it seamlessly matches the comic book theme. I also appreciate the stylization of certain villains. Kingpin is a character I don't think was portrayed accurately outside of the comics, just appearing as a generic, heavy-set bald brute, when he's really an enormous, borderline non-human tank. Kingpin looks excellent in this film, with his titanic body and small head with an intimidating grimace. He's a powerful force and a legitimately scary antagonist. Doc Ock is another example, portrayed as a brilliant, but outlandish female scientist with a psychotic passion for villainy. I didn't feel like I needed to know more about her character, she was such a fun villainess to watch. She really added to the suspense in some action sequences.<br/><br/>I really loved the story. I thought it was rich with charm and thrills. Granted, I did notice some familiar elements that are done to death in superhero fiction and the animation canon alike, such as surprise villain reveals and major character deaths that were obviously seen coming, and I certainly wish some characters (espeically Miles' uncle) had more screentime, but there's one fact that overshadows these flaws for me: The writing is mature. First of all, it's a Sony Animation product. If you look at this company's past work, some of it is very soulless with its marketing and panders to its audience with incessant pop culture references and juvenile comedy. Into the Spider-Verse is a welcome departure. Passion and integrity was put into this project. The writing is very grounded and treats its audience like people who want to see a genuinely captivating flick. Heck, the first third of the film is somewhat slow and nonchalant, almost like an arthouse film. I've never had such a cool, yet off-beat and engaged feeling while watching an animated film on the big screen. Nothing was forced, nothing felt out-of-place, nothing took me out of immersion. The tone and pacing is very adult, even when something excessively goofy like Spider-Ham is on-screen. It's like the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It can be dark and distressing, but lighthearted and amusing. There's a perfect balance and it never sacrifices integrity just to appeal to a niche audience. Well...there is that after-credits scene, but it was quite hilarious, so I let it pass.<br/><br/>That's the most I can say without spoiling a lot of the film. I want you to see this absolute marvel with your own eyes. To close, Into the Spider-Verse is everything I hoped it would be. This is a game-changer for both superhero filmmaking and animation altogether. Sleek, colorful, funny, emotional, frenetic. This film skillfully balances all these elements. There is never a moment that felt forced, it never talks down to the audience. It's a mature and stylish take on the Spider-Man mythos, and perhaps the best big-screen Spidey picture to date with some of the best animated visuals you'll ever see. I didn't have a single issue with this film. I was dazzled and moved throughout. Sony Animation, if this was your apology for The Emoji Movie, then apology goddamn accepted. Massive bravo!"

","A movie worthy of Stan Lee's approval. Incredible animation, great story, great message. This film lives up to the hype and honestly surpassed my expectations. The only reason I think there are some negative reviews is because you can never please everyone. However, for the vast majority of viewers, I believe you'll find this film to be great. Highly recommend seeing it in theaters just for the amazing animation style."
"Aaron_Kyle","8","251","307","10 January 2019"," Visually flawless
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is more than a pleasant surprise, which was at first a risky move for Sony judging by their recent ""successes"".<br/><br/>From the presentation alone it is easily decipherable that a lot of love and passion was put into this project, making it the visual masterpiece that it is.<br/><br/>The story, while being mostly formulaic still does enough to satisfy new and returning audiences to the superhero genre. Combined with the visual style and presentation, Into the Spider-Verse almost feels fresh.<br/><br/>The biggest issue, which is more of a personal preference is the music. The film chooses today's hip hop music over an actual musical score which is understandable but still managed to take me out of the film.<br/><br/>Another slightly smaller issue is the epilogue, rather the way the film sets it up. Press a button and save the world. It's as silly as it sounds.<br/><br/>In terms of comedy, Into the Spider-Verse does a solid job, but manages to be annoying at times with its usage of Spider-Ham.<br/><br/>On the contrary Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is worth a watch solely for its visual style and presentation. The story is just icing on the cake.<br/><br/>Final Grade: 8/10"
"soulsplosion","10","496","638","20 December 2018"," the most visually stunning film I've ever seen
","There's hardly anything I would improve about this film. The visuals, concepts, soundtrack, characters, pace, humor and animation are all some of the best I've ever seen in any film; I was worried the hype would ruin it for me, as it always does, but not even the group of kids in the theater who wouldn't stop loudly talking could ruin it for me. It is visually engaging and beautiful in every scene, not to mention with an incredibly unique art style, and is honestly something other animated movies should have to look up to for a long time. The only real issue I can think of is the flashing lights, which really alienates any epileptic audience, but even then it's done so in a beautiful and artful way."
"thinslicing","10","373","499","21 December 2018"," The better the art, the harder it is to find the right words to describe it.
","Updated review 4-9-19<br/><br/>I've now watched this movie 10 times since getting it on digital and then Blu-ray and can safely say this is a rare, near perfect movie. This is of course my opinion and I understand why this movie isn't for everyone. Let's break down a few of the reasons why for each of these points.<br/><br/>If we had a list of everything that can be done to make a near perfect movie, this movie checks every box. The visuals have been talked about endlessly. It won an Oscar for them. We know they're great.<br/><br/>The story is great, giving us a new Spider-Man with his own skills and personality that he brings to the table. The script is tight and the production is executed with laser precision.<br/><br/>The voice acting is nothing short of top notch. This is easily the second best thing about this movie right behind the glorious visuals.<br/><br/>Shamiek Moore has quickly grown on me over the ten times I've watched this movie. His range is as good as any veteran actor and he injects so much life into Miles Morales. He IS Miles Morales.<br/><br/>Chris Pine did not phone in the short amount of lines he had whatsoever. Just superb casting because he and Jake Johnson sound pretty similar. And oh boy, Jake Johnson.<br/><br/>I never understood why JJ had gotten so wildly popular over the last several years. With this movie I finally understand. I get it. It clicked. From the moment he pops up in this movie around the 20 minute mark till the end, Jake turns in one of the voice acting performances perhaps of all time. He succeeds in bringing a past his prime Peter Parker to life and runs the gamut of dramatic, sincere, intense, but above all FUNNY. Every single comedic line never fails to make me laugh out loud. Many of the gags pop into my head while I'm working or doing something else and I'll chuckle and repeat the line to myself.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld and she shines in this movie along with all the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about this movie also happens to be its weakness. For me, the visuals are second to none. Another review title summed it up perfectly. ""The most visually stunning movie I've ever seen"". Absolutely agree. And while it takes a little time - usually 10-15 minutes - for your eyes to adjust to the frame rate, some people apparently can not adjust to this. I can imagine how poor that viewing experience would be, too bad really. Another thing is since they didn't use actual motion blur, but instead chose to animate blur-like artifacts and tricks to make it seem like blur, or having images doubled and overlapped for a ghosting effect, it confuses some people into thinking they're seeing the 2 images of the 3D version without the glasses. And lastly, the sheer intensity of some of the rapid action sequences combined with visual aesthetic pushed just beyond the breaking point and then dialed ever so slightly back by the direction team, it's just simply too much for some people. I get that.<br/><br/>As far as continuity/plot holes and things of that nature, I think the movie could actually stand to be about 15-20 minutes longer. There really aren't many issues though so maybe this is just me being greedy for more visuals.<br/><br/>Original review: Sure, we can dissect and critique and praise using any number of words we choose, but in the end to actually appreciate truly great art, it simply must be experienced in the medium in which it was created. For this movie, it was lovingly crafted in 3D, and so in my opinion can only be fully realized by the viewer in 3D.<br/><br/>What is a comic book movie, and what makes it great? From the original Superman where we first saw a comic book hero fly, to Burton's dark and stylized Batman, to the graphic novel style Sin City, live action ensemble X-MEN, Spider-Man, Iron-Man, The Dark Knight, the entire MCU....all of these are comic book movies, and depending on your personal definition probably range from good to great. And they're all live action with varying degrees of special effects, and some with animation. If you had to pick ones that 'feel the most like a comic book', you'd probably pick Sin City for the overall look, and the phase 3 MCU films for a combination of visuals and capturing the tone and spirit of the comic book story arcs.<br/><br/>But they aren't literally animated comics. The closest to that would probably be the animated movies, right? Like Mask of the Phantasm or any number of the Marvel animated movies. But again those are really 'just cartoons', and I don't mean that in a bad way. They're simply cartoon versions of comic books.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is quite literally an animated comic book, and yet it is so much more at the same time. It's an explosion of comic book ink and paper, a dizzying palette of superbly rich colors, a jaw dropping display of digital artistry melded with living, breathing characters we care about, a story that is perfectly derived from the very medium in which it is being created and yet not for one single moment ever feels forced or hollow, a soundtrack fused with an endless exploration of a massive city, staggeringly sized scientific chambers, gigantic forests, and neon-electric-digital-dreamscapes of action set pieces that whir and click and come to life exactly as they do in the minds of children reading them on paper.<br/><br/>This movie is breathtakingly good in every aspect. Like-I'm-questioning-my-sanity-is-it-really-as-good-as-I-think-it-is!?!? Yes. Yes yes yes.<br/><br/>Remember the old Sega game Comix Zone? And how it was like ""oh wow! It's a comic book come to life!""? This is like that, with modern technology, cranked up a thousand times.<br/><br/>But here's the most important part - *it was all done in the right way, by the right people, at the right time*. It feels like this project was greenlit and handed to the very people who created comic books themselves with a ""here ya go, you have full creative control. Oh and by the way you have an unlimited budget! And resources! Have as much fun making a great movie as you possibly can!""<br/><br/>My first job was working in a movie theater. I took full advantage of being able to see free movies. I've built a decent surround sound system with all the creature comforts and have a growing library of movies. From the re-release of the original Star Wars trilogy, to each of the prequels and to the ongoing trilogy today, T-2, Titanic, the original X-Men, Avatar, The Dark Knight, Avengers, Avengers: Infinity War and so many more...I've gone to many, many big movie theater events for the experience. And I can safely say hands down that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse in 3D is the best moviegoing experience I have ever had. It's that great."

","Have you ever sat through a film and you knew that films would never be the same going forward? For example, Terminator 2, Star Wars.. the first Toy Story... Iron Man<br/><br/>Well this is one of those. This is a almost rather perfect film. Let me just say the the stylished animation is just top notch. It as if the comic book leaped off the pages. I've seen practically all super hero films to include the DC animated ones. This feels as if they took comic books and Playstation animation and just came up with this perfect look.<br/><br/>And the story is great.. the pacing is so wonderful. It is able to tell the story.. and an origin without boring us to tears like Zack Snyder has done in the DC universe. The story is quiet touching. And it allows us to have a pretty interesting Spider Man in Miles WITHOUT thrashing or having a Peter Parker like experience.<br/><br/>Plus our the villains are so well done..<br/><br/>But I think we will see a lot more of this type of animation in the future from Sony. I think they announced their presence with authority.. like how Dreamworks did with Shrek.. and how Pixar did.<br/><br/>It's been awhile I seen something so unexpected and so cool."

","This movie was absolutely incredible. From the animation, to the storytelling, to the characters this movie is completely one of a kind. It is easily the best looking animated movie of the year (no surprise there), but what really caught me off guard was the story they were able to tell in such a short amount of time. Each character has their own distinct personality and is given their own separate characterization without making the movie feel bloated. I knew I would end up liking this movie, but this movie has completely exceeded my expectations. If you enjoy superheros or animation you should 100% definitely watch it in a theater."
"darthakam","10","244","348","21 December 2018"," Into The Spider-verse reminds us why we love Spiderman so much, and does so in an original and humane way.
","Heads-up: I'm only going to be talking about Peter Parker in this review. I'll make a separate one for the film laterm I just feel like he deserves his own review. That's how great Peter is in this film.<br/><br/>Into The Spider-verse reminds us why we love Spiderman so much, and does so in an original and humane way.<br/><br/>I used to love Spiderman as a kid. I got obssessed with the cartoons he starred in as well as the original movie trilogy, one that actually helped me get interested in the character and marvel as a whole. But my love for this character, as most things, dissolved and it never got around to build itself up again, even after constant remakes and wonderful performances. I never felt that spark again, that love I felt for this charming dude was gone, dead.<br/><br/>Then Into The Spider-verse came, and my whole world turned upside down. I felt a fire inside my stomach. There it was, that long-forgotten love for Peter Parker, one that I thought I would never experience again, expanding continuously as the movie progressed, hitting me in all the right places.<br/><br/>I'd even dare to say that this movie made me understand the reason as to why spider-man is universally loved:<br/><br/>He's an everyday guy with super powers, that's it. He's flawed but pure at heart. He's relatable. He belongs to the people. He's one of us.<br/><br/>This movie's fresh take on Peter Parker is exactly what we needed to fully grasp that, how compelling this character can be without using any of his super powers. This version of Peter Parker is fat, subtly depressed, and tired, yet he's the most charming and lovable version of this character yet. It's something we haven't seen in quite a while, the genuine humanity that makes Peter Parker such a charismatic character, and one can only be thankful for it.<br/><br/>Spider-man is cool again, but in a totally different, and perhaps even better, way. Just your everyday dude taking a leap of faith, giving the audience who relates to his struggles courage to do the same. This is what Spiderman can be and what he should be. A character that's ours, a character that teaches you that anyone can be a hero, that's the real Spiderman. This is the true Homecoming. Spiderman is freaking back! Welcome home!"

","The worlds of superhero movies and superhero comics are not as similar as they seem on the surface. Currently, film studios are all about the ""extended universe"", seeing how many different titles and characters they can shove into one franchise (Avengers, X-Men, Justice League), making for an easy way to squeeze a few extra bucks out of their lesser known properties. Comics have this as well, of course. However, they also have something modern movies haven't really tapped into yet: story one-offs, a chance for a storyteller to create a unique tale and not be constrained by the implications on or from the larger universe. Spider-Verse gets to do just that, while playfully taking on the fun (if convoluted) absurdity of extended superhero universes.
Listen, I hear you. ""How could we possibly need another Spider-Man movie?"" Spider-Verse understands that question and has a take on it. Yes, Peter Parker is here. In fact, there are two Peter Parkers. There's also a Spider-Woman, a Noir Spider-Man, an anime Spider-Girl/Robot, and a Spider-Pig. At the center though is Miles Morales, an Afro-Hispanic Brooklyn teen who must help these other Spider-People get back to their own planes of existence. He fights with his cop dad, he adores his shady uncle, hates being simply the smartest kid in the room, and just wants to do something that matters. Being Spider-Man wasn't his idea, but hey, when a radioactive spider gives you powers, what choice do you have?
Look, I don't have any sort of hot take on this movie. It looks great, the humor pops with surprises, the voice casting is beyond perfect. It's simply a stylishly exciting and refreshingly unique take on the superhero genre, and sometimes that's more than enough."

"FairlyAnonymous","7","101","173","4 January 2019"," Visually innovative, but has a lack of focus and is overstuffed.
","As much as I enjoy this movie (and as an animator/storyartist I love the visuals!) I have to honest and say it is a bit of an unfocused mess. The reason why you should see this movie is because it is the first in what will hopefully be a trend of innovative and creative animated movies that aren't just looking over the shoulders of what Disney and Pixar are doing. This movie is its own creature and I think it deserves to be seen just for the visuals and the opportunity to hopefully support this trend...<br/><br/>However, I would only say that if the movie has some substance to it.... which it does. I recommend people see this movie, but it should be noted that I think this movie may be getting the ""Kubo"" treatment where an animated film is visually impressive to such a degree that people gloss over bad writing because everything they are looking at is so cool.<br/><br/>The first half of this movie is brilliant. I think just about everything in the first half works really well and is super effective. Miles Morales felt like a real kid with some real kid issues, Peter B Parker was funny, tragic and fleshed out, and Gwen... existed (we'll get to her later). My eyes were glued to the screen and I was excited for where the story would go as I was genuinely surprised at a couple twists and turns in the story.<br/><br/>Then, a certain moment happened in the movie where I was taken out of the film and went, ""Wait... oh shoot this is going downhill real fast."" It was the introduction of all of the other spider-verse characters. At that moment the film shifted gears into an entirely different film from the first half. Does Miles Morales fit in with the professionals? Can Miles Morales impress them? Everyone seems to hate him due to his lack of experience! Can Miles Morales take a leap of faith (which he already did in the beginning of the movie)??!?! Is Miles Morales even relevant to the story?!?!?!?! All of these sudden new themes and plot developments completely derail what the first half of the film was setting up to such a degree that it felt like a giant schism cut through the film and the second half of the film was waving goodbye to the first half.<br/><br/>I'll be clear that I have no issue with other spider-verse characters sharing screen-time in the film, the issue is that they don't add much in terms of character development or interaction with Miles. The characters should serve to help Miles grow, but in this movie they just seem like another pair of fists to punch bad guys, and there is no better example of this than...<br/><br/>Gwen Stacey.<br/><br/>Gwen Stacey has the unfortunate issue of being completely irrelevant to the story when she should be an important and vital character to Peter B Parker's/Miles Morales' character growth and should have an arc of her own. This is a character who witnessed Peter Parker (her best friend) die and Peter B Parker is someone who witnessed Gwen Stacey die in her universe! WHY DON'T THEY DISCUSS THIS!!! Peter B Parker should be surprised and excited to see someone he knew as dead alive again and she should be happy to see her best friend once more! Instead, the two characters just... punch bad guys... like everyone else. No growth or development between the two.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, Gwen doesn't even really work to help Miles Morales develop as a character. In the beginning of the film she is built up to be one of the main characters, but in the second half she doesn't develop any further than she did in the beginning. She experiences no character growth nor does she help develop any other characters. She just exists in the film.<br/><br/>I could go on for a while about all of the different weird pacing issues in the second half of the film such as Miles Morales suddenly getting super powerful and skilled out of nowhere (it's odd that people complain about ""Mary Sues"" in film but don't complain about Miles Morales going from zero to hero in one scene), or a single cut from a comedy scene to a tragic ""friends splitting up"" scene, some loose character threads such as Miles' dad telling cops to chase spider-man but we never see them do it, and many other instances of odd pacing choices and poor juxtapositions of emotional story beats.<br/><br/>But, I will end this on a positive note: All of the characters are enjoyable when they get their moment and I think the writing on the father was really good. He wasn't your typical ""larger than life"" father but a very honest, strong, but stubborn dad who has his flaws yet is very likable and reasonable. I wish him and Uncle Aaron had some scenes together and their dynamic was a bit more fleshed out, but as is I still like them regardless of the additional scenes they deserved.<br/><br/>Go see it if you want to support innovative and risky animation, but be warned that it is not a perfect film (other than visually)."

","What would you do if you could be a superhero? What if you have no choice? From the very beginning, Spider-Man: Into the Spicer-Verse is very energetic and captures your attention. This animated film has impressive visuals. The music creates a fantastic rhythm. And you just want to watch more.<br/><br/>The story follows a high school student named Miles Morales, who just changed school. He goes into an abandoned subway station with his uncle Erin and gets bitten by a radioactive spider. Ever since that day, Miles starts sticking to everything he touches. Then, he meets Spider-Man (Peter Parker), teams up with some friends from the same dimension and they attempt to save the world from the villain Kingoin.<br/><br/>The story is very original and makes the impossible possible. It takes all the abilities of Spider-Man to far and beyond with its action scenes. The film also shows a very real family atmosphere and the humor is smart. I love the non-traditional characters and how they embrace diversity. And yes! Spider-Man is Latino and surely does speak Spanish! There are also some fun new characters.<br/><br/>With this film, Marvel has created a film that celebrates comics, film and visual arts. Of course, it celebrates Spider-Man and makes this super hero relevant and contemporary. It is absolutely eye-poppingly beautiful and really pushes the boundaries of the genre with its colors, textures and camera movements. There are several different forms of animation in one film. You feel as if you are actually reading a comic book or the comic book is coming to life.<br/><br/>Naturally, the film does a very touching tribute to genius Stan Lee. I feel the filmmakers took some risks bringing new ideas to this iconic character which as been adored for over 50 years. The result is a must-see family movie that is even more appealing to new generations. I also love how this film is animated. It's so different. I've never seen a film like this one. I think it's very unique. Be sure to stay after the credits to see something very special, including another set of credits at the very end.<br/><br/>This film sets a new era in animated movies. I recommend it for ages 5 to 18, as well as adults. I give it 5 out of 5 stars and include it in my Oscar predictions as a very possible winner. This is the film parents will love their kids to watch and kids will enjoy in many different ways.<br/><br/>With great power comes great responsibility and we all can be heroes. This is the idea behind Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - inclusion for all in the vast universe and the idea that we can all be heroes by making the right choices and doing our best helping each other in our everyday life.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Zoe C., KIDS FIRST!

You feel his struggles and the pressure that he has to face in his life, with his parents, him releasing that his uncle is working for KingPin, living up to Peter Parker and Gwen and all the other spider people's expectations. You real feel for him. As for Peter Parker, I didn't like that they killed off Peter Parker from this universe at the start of the movie and then another version of Peter just comes up immediately after that. It kinda ruins the death and sadness a little. I would have liked it more if they had a couple more scene or maybe a one day jump before introducing the new spider man. But that's just me. After the Peter J. Parker, was introduced everything just kicked in from there. The whole sequence with Peter and Miles breaking in and out of that lab was wonderfully entertaining and Gwen's entrance couldn't be better. The other spider people introduced later were less useful aside from looking cool and having some memorable moments.<br/><br/>Have I talked about the animation yet? it's freaking amazing and watching this actually inspired me to work on some of my art projects that I have been putting off. From the details of the sky scrapers to the reflections and the whole climatic battle scene at the end is just beautifully done and just really really good and satisfying to look at.<br/><br/>Overall, the plot, the characters, the animation and the Stan Lee (oh, yes that was good too. Rest in peace Stan Lee, the line he delivered was also really funny and emotional as well) were just spectacular and amazing (see what I did there) and I definitely recommend this movie, even if you're not a Spiderman fan, watch it please. We need a sequel to for this movie. My hope on Sony has been restored."

","I knew that this movie would be good from the first moment I heard about it last year, and it did not disappoint me one bit. It met all of my expectations, and then went above and beyond them. The animation is a blend of CGI, stop animation, pop/comic book art and realism. The vibrant colors pop out at you, and the action sequences really enthrall. A very captivating and beautiful piece of art is this movie, and the writing choices leave nothing to be desired. The story is that of the traditional starting superhero with a bunch of twists thrown in. The movie itself actually follows past comics for the most part, with some minor changes here and there. A true Spider-Man, or comic book fan in general, will not have anything to criticize in this movie. Everything that fans want to see out of Spidey(s) is in this movie. There are multiple different variations of Spider-Man in the film, and all of them have their special moments to shine. The end credit scene just rockets this movie up past my already positive expectations, and it gets a 10/10 from me! The movie can be enjoyed by both young and old alike, and trust me, it will blow your mind! Best animated film of 2018, and one of the best superhero movies ever made. It deserves any and all awards and kudos it will surely garner."

"Zephrey","10","79","144","13 December 2018"," Anyone can wear the mask, but no one can rock it like Miles Morales
","I'm blown away, this movie is absolutely beautiful. The animation is stunning, the soundtrack is amazing and the dialogue and storyline is so heart-warming.
The characters are memorable, they all bring their own emotions rubbing off on the audience, and the humor is right on, its daring and hilarious and doesn't seem forced like you might see in some of the MCU films.
There's been 7 Spider-Man films in the last 16 years and this might be the best one yet, its pays its respect to the past films while driven on its own storyline adventure, being such a known character the movies still comes out as original.
The cinematography and animation are gorgeous, definitely oscar worthy. I'd say this is one of the best superhero origins movies ever made. Then there's the numerous amount of easter eggs, be on the lookout for those.
I can't say the movies underrated cause its be treated just as it should be, but if there's one thing that its underrated its the soundtrack, the funny thing is the soundtrack is the exact type of music Miles Morales would listen to, so I guess you could say there's a touch of realism.
In the end all I can see is go see this movie for yourselves, the visual experience is amazing, its touching and serious, funny and witty, brings more emotion than some of the superhero movies you'll see today and best of all if your sick of superhero movies this is a complete different and fresh start of the genre.

","There have been so many spiderman films, each of which was cut off from a sequel and rebooted over and over.

Into the spiderverse takes you on a sci-fi adventure of multiverse, a spiderman film we have all been waiting for.<br/><br/>The animation alone stands out to be the best feature about this film. This new style of comic book animation is top notch and a must watch especially for comic book lovers. The efforts taken in creating and rendering this film was worth it. The film is innundated with so much of high quality design, byzantine animation, one can't take their eyes off the screen and even afford to miss a scene.<br/><br/>Even though it has a small run time to it, as most animated films do, this film offers a good character development and good storyline which is unpredictable at times making you shout out ""wow"" especially if you are a spiderman geek.<br/><br/>There is an adequate amount of humor. The humor is not forced at all, it has good one liners that makes you enjoy the film from the very beginning.

"educallejero","7","30","50","25 February 2019"," Too kid friendly, but good!
","The movie is visually spectacular (with the exceptions of a handful of blurry scenes filled with blues and reds, maybe for 3D purposes?). The colours and character designs are gorgeous. The dynamics of the action and the camera work is superb. All of this is ""all time great"" level.<br/><br/>But... The story is ultra basic, therefore quite boring for about 45 impossibly predictable minutes. The jokes, while clever for a movie for kids, just didn't make me laugh. Not even one time. I'm not sure why. Also, the story lacks all kinds of depths. It's literally no sense, but I don't think is the focus of the movie, because...<br/><br/>What really works is the theme of the film. Everybody can ""wear the mask"". And they proved it by showing it, not depending on melodramatic and cliched monologues, but with the story itself, that included different versions of totally different people ""wearing the masks"".<br/><br/>The emotional bits also work well and kind of justify the boring preparation for it, developing Miles Morales origin story and his family and problems really well. Simple, but well done.
For last, the villains and its plans are just almost pointless and beyond under developed. There was probably no enough time to give them better and more coherent plans.
A good movie, visually superior with a well done and coherent message that actually works in the story (sometimes these superhero movies contradict themselves and they are about the ""problem with violence""... by using violence to solve the problem. No here. Spiderman is not white, black, female, old or young. It can be anybody. And they are good)."

I loved all the different Spider people that were added in. Miles is awesome and comes with a lot of emotions. Bring the tissues for this one!

","I had my doubts when Sony said they they were making a new cartoon Spider-Man movie, considering their last outing was the Emjoi Movie.
The trailer displayed the artwork pretty well, but still I didn't want to get my hopes up. The reviews made it sound like the best Spiderman movie ever. So I went to the movie theater and watched it with my brother. And I was, in short absolutely captivated.<br/><br/>Miles Morales is a teen protege growing up in Brooklyn with a hard nosed cop for a dad, a loving mother and an uncle, Aaron who helps him explore his ambition as a graffiti artist. The problem is the new school he goes to isn't the life he's looking for, and he is doing all he can to get out of it, against his family's wishes.But that all changes when he meets three people: a girl in his class named Gwen Stacy, a 26 year old blonde guy named Peter Parker and a radioactive spider.<br/><br/>Because of a portal opened by Wilson Fisk, the dna of. Spider-Man attracts in alternate Spider-Ma.... i mean Spider-People, dragging them all into Miles' Brooklyn neighborhood. It's up to them, including a middle aged and cynical Peter, Spider-Woman, Spider- pig, and a depressed and grungy Spider-Man Noir, to stop Kingpin from using the portal again to rip a hole in the space time continuum.<br/><br/>But that being said, that doesn't touch a bit on how hilarious, how heart breaking, and how endearing the scenes can be moment by moment. The animation and concept art go hand in hand, and gives the film a high tech, pop art appeal like nothing the world has ever seen at this scale or skill. Words can't describe the way this movie moves and feels like the best comic book ever written.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this enough. Go watch this movie right now and you will not be disappointed But don't watch it if you have epilepsy or anything like that. It gets pretty flashy."

This movie understands what Spider-Man means to people and and the universe it's build. The story features Miles Morales a character never seen in a movie before and it's captures his personality straight from the comics. The movie also features Peter Parker as a side character to make room for a new Spider-Man and I love this part of the story and how it introduces so many characters but doesn't feel crowded. The animation is also very beautiful, fluid and unique you'll never be bored. It's also very funny for kids of all ages to enjoy.

","Miles Morales has just started at a new school and is struggling to fit in. Then he is bitten by a radioactive spider and he obtains certain powers, similar to those of Spiderman. He doesn't know what to do with the powers, or how to control them, so naturally he turns to Spider-Man for advice.<br/><br/>Had some potential, initially, to be an original take on Spider-Man and comic book movies in general. The story doesn't follow Peter Parker, so is not the same Spider-Man story that's been told over and over before. Is animated, so original in terms of production (ironically, considering what comic book movies are based on...).<br/><br/>However, despite these differences, it ends up being pretty much same old, same old: a linear, action-based story. Character development is token: everything is just a set up to get to the next action scene. Plot, what there is, is what you'd expect from a comic book movie: rambling, basic. Quite unengaging.<br/><br/>Is fun at times, but certainly no more than your average comic-book movie.<br/><br/>Hardly revolutionary, despite all the hype that says it is."

The characters are all great. Miles Morales is a fantastic protagonist; understandably scared at the prospect of being Spider-Man, but excited to learn. His relationship with his father and Peter Parker are some of the most emotiinal scenes in the movie. Gwen Stacy is also a great supporting character, as are thr rest of the spider people.
The villains are fun and the action is jaw dropping.
It's also tear jerking tribute to Stan Lee.

"jetmoviereviews","10","41","77","19 December 2018"," The Spider-Man Movie Sony Needed
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an ambitious film. Sony's last few attempts with the character of Spider-Man have been underwhelming to say the least. I haven't seen a good Sony owned Spider-Man movie since 2004's Spider-Man 2. Luckily, Spider-Man: Homecoming turned out to be a pretty good film, but that was mainly Disney and Marvel Studios, so I still had low expectations. However, I am happy to say that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an awesome Spider-Man film, and an amazing film overall.
Instead of following Peter Parker like every other Spider-Man film out there, this film instead tells the story of Miles Morales and how he handles being Spider-Man. This is a bit different, however, because instead of skipping the learning and the suit making, we see his struggles firsthand. Miles makes a promise to his world's original Spider-Man that he would put a stop to Kingpin, but he has no idea how to control his powers, so he has a hard time.
Luckily, Kingpin's fancy collider machine happens to bring in some other Spider-Man, as well, so that Miles can get the help that he needs. The best part about this film is the way the characters are handled. The writers understand the character of Spider-Man, no matter what dimension he/she is from. They all have different personalities and art styles that make them stand out from each other. They did such a great job that I now want to see spin-off films for all of the Spider-Men in this movie.
Into the Spider-Verse is a lighthearted film, and is able to mix seriousness with comedy for the perfect effect. From the comedy aspect, the film, as I said before, understands Spider-Man. He is a funny character and knows how to stay calm in any situation. He cracks goofy jokes and says witty one-liners. With this movie, the different personalities of the different Spider-Men mixing together brings the comedy. On the other hand, the serious family issues bring some conflict to different characters, but in order to keep this spoiler free, I will not go in depth.
There is one issue I have with the film, but it isn't too big. Okay, the character is too big, but the issue is not. Kingpin, I feel, needed more characterization in order for me to think of him as a good villain. We learned some things about his family, but that was really it. He was a just a large man who wanted to conduct an evil plot. I can look past this, however, because the movie wasn't really focused on Kingpin. It was more focused on the Spider-Men, and most importantly, Miles Morales. Since this was done so well, I can forgive the film the Kingpin issue.
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a film that was much needed on Sony's part, because it shows that they still have good things they can do with the character. Animation, I feel, is the best format for Spider-Man, but that might be because I grew up watching the Spider-Man animated series. Overall, this is an awesome film, and definitely deserves a watch. If you are a Spider-Man fan, I believe you will truly adore this movie as much as I did. If you are a heavy critic who doesn't know much about the character of Spider-Man, I think you will enjoy this movie too. If you just like movies in general, go out and see this movie. It's worth it."
"jackgdemoss","9","23","40","17 December 2018"," The BEST depection of Spider-Man yet!
","This film was phenomenal for so many reasons. First and most importantly, it was the most visually impressive film I have seen to this day. The animation style alone had such a mystical and wonderous quality to it. The animators didn't stop there, however. They added so many little fun details that made me feel like I was watching some sort of blend between comic and movie. In addition to the gorgeous visual nature of Spider-Man, I was impressed by both the humor and the meta references. The reference to the cringey Spider-Man 3 scene and the post-credits meme reference were my personal favorites. There were tons of little details that I am sure I never truly appreciated because I have never been a consumer of comic books, but I have to imagine that this film is even more special to Marvel comic fans. The only gripe that I have with Spider-Man is that it failed to keep my attention in act 3. It was longer than it should have been, and it would have benefited greatly by cutting down 10 minutes. With that being said, this is the best movie I have seen in a few months and I hope that my review reaches someone who was not going to see it and urges them to reconsider."

I love the fact that this movie, makes us feel nostalgic about the previous big screen adaptations of Spider-Man. The animation is awe-inspiring. The comic book format of the animation is unique & is perfect for one of the most loved comic book characters. The 3D is amazing(watch this film on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX). The action set pieces, the humour & the emotional scenes are perfectly balanced, throughout. The voice-over work is unforgettable. Shameik Moore is spectacular as Miles Morales. Moore brings that much needed vulnerability to his character. Jake Johnson is outstanding as Peter B. Parker. Hailee Steinfeld is brilliant as Gwen Stacy. Mahershala Ali is perfect as Uncle Aaron. Brian Tyree Henry is excellent as Jefferson Davis. John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn & Nicolas Cage are awesome as Spider-Ham, Peni Parker & Spider-Man Noir, respectively.

","This had better win some Oscars.<br/><br/>Okay, from the beginning: this movie is excellent. It is a thrill ride from start to finish, from being inventive to charting a new story to introducing so many good characters. Miles Morales' story is unique, emotional, and above all, fun.<br/><br/>Performances: they're voice performances, so at first glance there isn't much to consider, but once you get further into the movie, you hear these actors truly commit to their characters. Shameik Moore's voice embodies Miles Morales perfectly, and Jake Johnson finally finds a character that's not a stoner; he does have fun with it. Haliee Steinfeld is exhilarating and perfect as Spider-Gwen. The rest of the cast... they're all fantastic, I just don't have time to talk about it right now. Go Spider-Ham!<br/><br/>Direction/Writing: with three different directors, you'd expect this to come off as jumbled and incoherent, but it is not that at all. The scenes are well executed, the fight choreography is exhilarating, and the way they blend animation is simply stunning. The writing was soooooooo goooooooood. Phil Lord really had a story he wanted to tell, and he didn't skip out on any opportunity; somehow, we'll be laughing one minute and bawling the next. He really left it all on the field, especially with all ridiculous avenues he decided to go down with characters like Spider-Ham, Penny Parker, and Spider-Man Noire. The best part is it all works! The villain, Kingpin, is a bit sidelined, but it doesn't matter in the end because the story is about Miles and the people in his life. There's a moment in the trailer where Miles jumps off a building and we get this beautiful upside-down shot, and that moment is somehow even more satisfying given everything that leads up to it. The combo of story and characters truly does work.<br/><br/>There's so many things I could talk about, from the immersive world to the killer soundtrack to the fact they use sound effects that correspond to the character's respective universes. You can feel the amount of time and effort that went into this movie, and you can feel that feeling of satisfaction that it paid off. It's a truly unique movie and inventive experience that is a sight to behold. (10/10)<br/><br/>Seriously, Academy, look at this movie. And give it like all the awards."
"samarkandfilms","7","30","55","29 December 2018"," great visuals, good characters but not a great story.
","The origin of miles morales is really well done in my opinion, peter b parker is an interesting character too, Gwen Stacy is also good but the other 3 spider people didn't have any purpose other than comedic relief in the story, which is fine, as long as the overarching story is good. it wasn't. Basically the kingpin wants to bring back his dead family by collecting them from a dimension in which they haven't died. maybe this would been a relatable motivation if this wasn't shown in a flash back, which just seems cheap to me.<br/><br/>For me it just fell apart in the third act in which the so far great origin story, just devolves into a, quickly press the button to save the world moment. The message the movie gives that any one can be spider-man, you don't need a costume or superpowers to be a hero is great though. Shame about the boring ending and villain."

What could this possibly be to be heralded in such a way?<br/><br/>Telling the story of a young man who is also bitten by a radioactive spider and develops superpowers. Kingpins latest dastardly scheme is tearing the fabrics of reality apart and alternate universe versions of Spiderman have all ended up in the same universe. I'm sure you can work out what happens next.<br/><br/>So the animation style is a tweak on Pixar, it plays out like a comic book and call me weird but that certainly didn't work for me. The animation doesn't flow fluidly, it looks hokey, disjointed and I found myself frustrated by it.<br/><br/>The plot is a novel concept and I liked it, the delivery however I did not. Certain aspects make very little sense, sure it's a Spiderman film so I'm not supposed to think about it too much but I did and my conclusions were migraine inducing stupidity. Did I say stupidity? Oh the stupid doesn't end there sadly, I get the multiverse concept of anything is possible but their Spiderman variant choices were bafflingly dumb and what you'd expect from a Saturday morning cartoon not a blockbuster film!<br/><br/>It tries to be heartfelt, but comes across half-assed.

It tries to be action packed but the style of animation didn't allow it to be done justice.<br/><br/>Okay I'm slating the film right now so it probably sounds like I hated it, which I didn't. 6/10 is a fair rating and suggests its above average and it is. But I'm annoyed at the acclaim that's it's been bathed in.<br/><br/>8.6 rating on IMDB are you kidding me? And the Oscars have lacked credibility in my eyes for years because of their ridiculous bias and genre-snubbing but this right here is the last bit of credibility up in smoke. I'm not saying a superhero movie shouldn't be Oscar worthy, but this silly cartoon simply isn't (And neither is Black Panther but I'll resist the urge to rant).<br/><br/>Into the Spider-Verse to me is no different than all the straight to DVD Marvel and DC efforts we see a couple of each year. The only difference here is the animation style, nothing else sets it apart.<br/><br/>I just don't get the appeal.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Some great writing<br/><br/>Great idea<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Animation hardly flows<br/><br/>Unexpectedly silly<br/><br/>Plot holes that are unforgivably stupid"

","To start with: I am an enormous Spider-Man fan. Added to this: I am a huge fan of Miles Morales. Now hearing this you may assume that I'd love anything with Spider-Man... and... I mean... you're not wrong. I don't think I outright 'hate' anything Spider-Man related. But at the same time, no other Spider-Man movie has had me writing reviews on Amazon, Fandango, IMDB, and Rotten Tomatoes singing its praises.<br/><br/>Into the Spider-Verse is (to me)- without a doubt- the best Spider-Man movie yet. And to be fair, if there was ever a movie I was skeptical about, it was this one. Sony Animation-- the same people who did The Emoji Movie and the Smurfs films-- making the first Marvel animated movie (not counting Big Hero 6)?? Was't looking too good... But DANG did they knock it out of the park! Not only are the visuals outstanding-- using 3D animation in an almost unprecedented way where it seriously looks like it is a living comic book-- but the cast, soundtrack, and story are all phenomenal. For anyone who reads the comics, there's plenty of Spider-Man fan service. For anyone who doesn't, there's plenty here to keep you thoroughly entertained throughout. It's got its moments of being down-to-earth, it's got humor, it's got heart. It's definitely a super hero film, but it's also a coming-of-age film.<br/><br/>If you even remotely enjoy Spider-Man, do yourself a favor and check this out!"

","Edit: I see a lot of people have already thumbed down this review because it sounds like people are playing the race card with this movie. ""Peter Parker is the only Spider-Man!!"" Look watch the movie for yourself, or don't see it at all. If you're really that bothered by a black Spider-Man in this movie then why are you here reading reviews? You still have the Rami films and heck you still have the Garfield films if that's what floats your boat. If you really care about good storytelling and good animation then hear me out.
Into the Spider-Verse is the hour of redemption for Sony's animation studio. I haven't been particularly happy with their recent films ranging from endless Hotel Transylvania sequels, constant remakes of the Smurfs, and of course the god awful Emoji Movie. I kept asking myself, when Sony? When will you actually use your creative talents and give us something worth our time? And folks, this is it. This is their baby. Into the Spider-Verse is not only one of the best animated films of the year, it's one of the best Spider-Man films period. I was skeptical at first too, the high ratings, the complex story, the studio, but thankfully the reviews were right on this. What this movie does so well is how it constantly engages its audience through visual storytelling. It reflects the same methods Stan Lee/Steve Ditko used when they wrote their comic stories all those years ago. You can tell the filmmakers did their homework and really captured the comic book esthetic to a whole other level. It's colorful, it's full of amazing textures, and the action is just amazing to watch. Now if the movie solely relied on this I probably would've given it a lower rating but thankfully they wrote a nice story here. We get to finally see Miles Morales come to life and while I didn't think he had the most interesting personality compared to say Peter Parker, he worked as a vessel for the audience. We got to see his Spider-Man journey in a very unique and interesting way that feels nostalgic but fresh at the same time. I do have to add that I didn't quite feel the emotional weight in this film with Miles' character arc like I did in Tobey's Spider-Man 2, but it was still emotionally satisfying for this film on its own when you don't compare it to previous films. In the end, this was still my favorite Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2. It's funny, fun, and full of heart. I would be ok with Sony owning the license to Spider-Man if they kept making movies with this animation style but still carry some depth and passion in the storytelling. Because this movie honored the most endearing thing about Spider-Man's story, and it's that anyone can wear the mask. It's that universal trait that Steve Ditko and Stan Lee created all those years ago that make this character so mythological and so palpable. And this has one of Stan's best cameos yet I promise you that. If you're a Spidey fan, or just a comic fan, or even just a fan of animated films. YESSS GO SEE IT. This is my favorite animated film of the year, if not in years, and might potentially creep into my top 10 films of the year. PLEASE GO SUPPORT THIS. 9/10."

"andreaf-78503","10","24","43","20 December 2018"," Sony's Redemption
","This movie was outstanding! After seeing The Emoji Movie last year, I had low expectations for any Sony movie coming out. After I found out this movie was coming out, I was nervous. Being a Marvel fan at heart, I didn't like the idea of a Marvel movie being put in the hands of Sony. After watching the trailers, I got more hopeful and decided I would check it out. And boy am I glad I did. This movie is one of my favorite animated movies of all time. Let's start with my favorite part of the movie, the animation. I absolutely loved the idea of an animated movie being told as a comic book. It was so colorful. Sure it was a bit blurry at times (once to the point where my friend thought we went to the 3D version on accident) but it made up for it. The part where the glass breaks from the building was beautiful. And Kingpin's body was hilarious. 10/10 for animation. Next, storyline. It was a pretty good story line, but it could've used a bit more work. The beginning was a bit confusing but I would say I was just about as confused as Miles was. One clichÃ© thing though was that if the rest of the Spider people didn't get back to the universe they would disintegrate. Very funny Marvel, very funny. One thing that was really shocking was how(SPOLIER ALERT!!!!!!!) Aaron was secretly Prowler. That shocked the heck out of me. I liked Kingpin's motivation, but I could point it out a mile away. 8/10 for storyline. Last but not least, characters. I personally really enjoyed the characters. I loved that some of the Spider characters got a chance at the big screen. Miles was my favorite by far. I also enjoyed that they had a different version of Peter Parker. The middle-aged, overweight, divorced side of him. I wished they would do a bit more character development for the other characters though. 9/10 for characters. One last thing. I found it really touching that they did a tribute to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko after the credits. They would be very proud of this movie."

","Watched Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse with my daughter today and both of us enjoyed it. Despite having seen many prior Spider-Man films before, this film felt fresh and had an uplifting message that anyone can be Spider-Man. Great animation, voice acting and music."
"user-651-726996","6","34","64","15 March 2019"," Visually Beautiful but the Good Part of the Story is in Another Dimension
","It started of well and I knew by the trailer what I was going to expect. I was waiting for something beyond my expectation but when it became weirder it definitely became a lot weirder. If you have seen episodes of The Flash, this film's story feels like meh. Apart from the dialogues, it's definitely bad writing. The main character is completely clueless about being spider-man but when the writers need him to use his skills, voila!, he knows it all, like the back of his hand.<br/><br/>People who say this is the most visually stunning film they have ever seen are those who haven't seen films. All those who have given this a rating standing at 8 point something have been blown over the visuals of this film which is great but every film's basic foot lies in it's screenplay. This is sloppy writing. Aunt May being kind of Iron Man and all. There is a moment in every new super hero film where the hero falls short of confidence and then a few scenes or a lot of scenes later the confidence is regained. Here it happens in the very next scene. What a load of BS. Spider-man sticky web sticks to his hand easily and is a disturbance for him but it is conveniently easy for the villain to break that sticky web<br/><br/>And Nicoles Cage..Are you kidding me...His way of talking makes it irritatingly meme funny. Depressing. His character was a complete waste.<br/><br/>But definitely much better than Captain Marvel.
This film is visually stunning and the animation is excellent. Kudos to the animation artists. But the writers need to write better."
"drael64","5","34","64","3 March 2019"," It's just okay.
","The visuals, while extremely ADHD are beautiful and help mask the usual uncanny valley physics that plague CGI heavy movies. That said, what is actually happening in some scenes is pretty vague, generally it's too busy.<br/><br/>The story telling is competent, when the writing isn't tripping over itself with overly concious lines, or progressive character tropes. At least unlike most such movies, the messaging doesn't entirely overtake the plot, and there is actual character development.<br/><br/>And even with those progressive tropes, there is some messaging around courage, and tenacity, typical of heroic movies that are often absent in the more wish forfillment progressive typical story telling.<br/><br/>Although for a hero origin movie, there is very little trace of self sacrifice, which is it's essential nature. Still, whilst it is somewhat hamfisted message fiction, they manage to wrap it into a plot that makes the film servicable and tucks the messaging into places where a less observant eye might miss it.<br/><br/>In general, it's safe to say this is pitched at kids. Which makes me not the target audience. It's neither good, nor bad, whilst the comic book graphic style in itself is worthy of some praise."
"donepudisrikar","9","23","41","20 December 2018"," Finally pushing Spiderman boundries
","We all grew up with Spiderman, mine was Raimi's blockbuster trilogy. This film not only nods to those Masterpieces but gives us more. It was crazy to see the Spiderman PS4 suit in there along with the post credits scene throwing us way back to the comics. Also everytime nicholas cage spoke it was basically greatness (greatness awaits?)<br/><br/>The plot while not complicated was well executed using fantastically funny internal monologues, well painted backstories, and of course beautiful action sequences which contain a crazy amount of Easter eggs btw! A Spiderverse shows the many shades of Spiderman, inspiring us as well to find our shade and take that leap of faith. I guess we are indeed Spiderman, Stan Lee. This movie makes you REALLY feel like spiderman.<br/><br/>The one con I had with the movie was that while the movie didn't want to become another Peter Parker joint, Peters arc took up a significant amount of the time taking away from the other spider people (&pig). Maybe the movie could have been longer to use the others to strengthen Miles' arc into an even more explosive finale."

8 hrs Â·
I'll run out of superlatives describing how good this movie is. Not only is it already my favorite best comic book movie but it may even be one of the best animated films I've ever seen, rivaling Pixar's best. The animation pops and brings comic book pages to life right down to the 'Kirby Krackle'. Animators have attempted this unique blend of 2D and 3D animation styles that just work wonders in translating the comic book feel to motion unlike anything before. A very visionary alternative to the 3D Pixar style that has become the industry standard since Toy Story back in 1995. It's even psychedelic in parts. They've done some clever use of dialogue boxes, thought bubbles and transitions that are unique to comic books. Every single frame is brimming with Spiderman references ranging from iconic to those obscure deep comic book lore. The screenplay is crisp and sharp too. I'd totally be okay if the current live action superhero boom ends with Avengers 4 next year (just because I'm already committed) and shifts to this format going forward. #IntotheSpiderverse is an innovative, kinetic and endearing masterpiece. If you have the option to watch only one movie this holiday season then pick this one."
"erenerginler","9","13","21","21 December 2018"," Amazing, Spectacular, Incredible, Just, BEAUTIFUL
","I'm not a person who likes to rewatch movies right after finishing them. But for this, I can say that everything has a first.<br/><br/>Let's get the obvious out of the way, the animation. I love how this movie looks. The creators really put effort in making this. There are scenes where text appears on screen. It literally looks like a comic book. And while I haven't read many comic books, I still think it looks amazing. I also appreciate how Peni Parker is drawn like an anime girl, and Spider-Ham (aka my favorite one) is drawn like a character from loony toones. But everyone has talked about the animation, so you probably know anyway.<br/><br/>The story is as amazing as the animation. Well not quite, but close. If you didn't know, this movie is about this villian king pin (if I'm getting that right) who opens portals to 5 different dimensions. Each one brings a new spider person. But the main character isn't even peter, it's miles. Miles gets bitten right before the dimension opening, and so he is a noob for most the movie. Ok I'll stop the spoilers. The emotion in this movie, while predictable, is pretty powerful. The humor, which is important to me, is pretty good. And while that mainly comes from the spectacular peter porker, there are some other good jokes too.<br/><br/>My probably biggest complaint is that the sidekicks (noir ham and peni) weren't used enough. Like I know this is about miles, and peter and Gwen play a big role in that, the sidekicks were advertised a lot too, and they barely got any screen time. Although in the final battle, peni and ham get pretty good scenes.<br/><br/>
Overall, I can't wait to rewatch this when it's on dvd, and please just go see it."

The story is your typical story, near the end it does get a little too bunched but I am more than willing to forgive it for that. The characters are excellent, I am no fan of anime at all but I loved the unique anime style and expressions Peni Parker gave, I loved the cartoonish nature of Spider-Ham, Related to the edgy nature of Spider-Man noir, Felt sympathy for Miles, emjoyed Peter Parker, and loved Gwen. The action is great, no more needs to be said. And to wrap this review up: The animation is AMAZING, never before have I seen such creative style in animation, this is the best animation I've seen ever.

For those who haven't see this film, I won't spoil any of the plot points. Getting that out of the way I loved many styles the film portrayed. The films way of creating a layered animation, in which, you can see multiple different versions of the same person or object. It mostly gave off the feel of looking through the eyes of a spider.<br/><br/>I was also happy to see in this film that they didn't keep dragging on the same story, but just using different actors or scenes. No film, like Spider-Man Homecoming, gave a new outlook on Spider-Man. With a diverse cast whom all seemed to voice act perfectly, my favorite being John Mulaney, they didn't just feel like a bland group of individuals. Instead, the film allowed for the audience to really connect with each character. I don't think that the animation ruins it, I also don't think that it would have changed the quality of the film if it wasn't animated.<br/><br/>So, what can a really say?

"TheMovieDoctorful","10","30","56","18 December 2018"," So Much More Than I Could Have Hoped
","I've waited 4 years to love Spider-Man this much. From comics to movies to video games, the last Spider-Man related story that I truly loved was the divisive Marc Webb movie, The Amazing Spider-Man 2. However, 2018 has really turned things around for my favorite Marvel superhero; from his groundbreaking video game for the PS4 to the brilliant Nick Spencer taking the reigns from the incompetent Dan Slott in the comics. Hell, even the MCU's depiction of Spider-Man (Which I despised in both Civil War and Homecoming) was surprisingly enjoyable in Infinity War, despite my thoughts on the rest of the film. The resurgence in quality Spider-Man stories continues with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse; perhaps the best superhero film since 2004's Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>The voice cast couldn't have been better. I've been saying how Shameik Moore would make a perfect Miles Morales ever since I saw him in Dope and he doesn't disappoint here. Much like Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn or J.K Simmons J.J Jameson, Shameik Moore IS Miles Morales as far as I'm concerned. He nails Morales ambition, his selflessness, his emotional vulnerability and his overall shyness in one of my favorite comic book movie performances ever. You could not have picked a better actor for this role.<br/><br/>Jake Johnson as an older, more broken (But still witty) Spider-Man who's lost his way was unexpected, but really interesting. Johnson is funny and charismatic, but has a real emotional pathos to him that takes his performance to the next level. He may actually be my favorite cinematic acting performance for Peter Parker He's a surprisingly complex character for a more family-targeted Spider-Man film and Johnson handles Parker's ascent from washed up has-been to the Spidey we all know and love wonderfully.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage as Spider-Man Noir is a joy to listen to whenever he's on screen. His deliciously hammy New York accent firing off witty 1930s one liners is something never knew I needed so badly. I found myself smiling pretty much every time he spoke. It's a smaller role, but by God, Cage absolutely does his thing and it benefits this wacky, incredibly imaginative movie wonderfully.<br/><br/>All of the characters here feel so real and human. Miles' strong sense of honor and commitment to the ideals of his role models make him such a likable and easy-to-root for lead. Long before Miles dons his iconic red & black hoodie costume from the comics, he fully embodies the selflessness, compassion and empathy that make Spider-Man such an inspirational and iconic character. I can totally understand why his kindness and capacity for good inspire Jake Johnson's Spider-Man to return to his heroic and altruistic ways he had long since abandoned. The film really does an excellent job of testing Miles' will power, the sincerity of his innate goodness, putting him through the ringer emotionally as he suffers insurmountable, but staggeringly human, losses. This is the kind of Spider-Man that I wanted to be when I grew up. The character journey that Peter Parker goes through here is easily the most nuanced and layered he's experienced in a movie. From the deadbeat loser we see in the first act, to the hopeless martyr of the second to our Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man we witness in the third, the sheer depth (And natural pace) of Spider-Man's development here is something I honestly never thought the screenwriting duo of Lord & Rothman were capable of. Even with villains and minor characters like Kingpin, Uncle Aaron and Miles' father Officer Davis are all characters whose hopes, dreams, fears and ambitions are all things I could easily describe.<br/><br/>Much like Suicide Squad, the film makes the wise decision of using its vast and diverse gallery of characters to bring in a wondrous array of different visual styles. We have the urban graffiti style of Miles Morales, the 60s Marvel style of Peter Benjamin Parker, the Marvel Now! style of Spider-Gwen, the Golden Age comics style of Spider-Man: Noir, the Acme style of Spider-Ham and the anime style of Peni Parker. It's no secret that the film's core message is that anyone with a big spine and a bigger heart can be Spider-Man, but what makes Into the Spider-Verse so impressive is that, like the best comic books, it conveys this all visually. Every one of these different styles gets their own spot in the sunlight and I feel that every viewer will find a style here that really touches them on a personal level, just as each viewer is likely to find a Spider-Man here who they can relate too and resonate with emotionally. Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse isn't merely a great comic book movie, it's a comic book brought to life.<br/><br/>I'll always have appreciation for soundtracks that really capture the musical tastes of a specific generation. They almost act as cultural time capsules of the time in which they were released. Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse very much fits this description, featuring some of the best and most atmospheric songs of Post Malone, Juice Wrld, Seezyn, XXTentacion, Swae Lee and Annuel AE's careers. I haven't loved a soundtrack to a comic book movie this much since Spawn. Just like that film, Into The Spider-Verse's soundtrack really captures the musical atmosphere of the late 2010s. It just set such an emotional tone for the film, one that's very much earned with this excellent and moving screenplay.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse is easily the best superhero film of 2018 and its place as the 2nd best Marvel film to date is unlikely to be unseated by anything else. It's a must see for anyone with even a remote love for the character and it completely makes up for the terrible depictions of Spider-Man in both Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming. It's nice to see my faith (Or, relative faith over Marvel studios, at least) rewarded."
"Kcpjhp","10","30","56","16 December 2018"," Spidey always find a way to get back up...!!!
","I'm going to review this movie first, for those people who aren't psychotic about Spidey or comics.
There is enough humor, action, dazzling visuals, drama, and most importantly... H E A R T in this film for FOUR MOVIES. If you like any of the aforementioned characteristics, you should go see this movie on the largest screen possible.
Now, for my fellow fans of the wise cracking wall crawler....this was a dream come true!!! All the character variations....all the classic villains....a nod to the TV shows, a nod to the previous films, a very touching dedication to @therealstanlee and Steve Ditko, all while telling an original story that was an absolute BLAST to watch.
I LOVED THIS MOVIE IN EVERY WAY! 10 out of 10."
"ninjaboyballer","10","29","54","19 December 2018"," THE spider man movie
","I gotta day I thought this movie was going to suck because of that awful emoji movie by Sony. Boy was I wrong. This probably my favorite spider man movie. It as great characters, great comic book action, great emotional moments, great animation. I also liked in some particular scenes they were down for using violence. In the movie a character gets crushed and another one gets shot. Although it didn't actually show any blood or anything, it's still a bit over the top for a PG movie. But I'm glad they had the balls to do that. It also feels like your watching an actual comic book. Like they have those sound effects like when spider man thwips his webs and when characters punch and kick each other and explosions go off. It feels like a panel of a comic come to life. I also like how they make peter and Gwen's backstories hilariously sad. This is actually a pretty funny movie. I was suprised that this movie was funny. I also like they have journeys for the two main characters that are wrapped up by the end of the film. This film also shows how the character of spider man is so inspirational and important. How he matters not just to the marvel universe but how he relates to people who read his stories. And the post credits scene is probably my favorite of this year. Wait till the end to see it. I pretty much loved everything about this movie except probably Kingpin. He was underdeveloped a lot and I wish he was given more to do. Overall though, Spider man into the spider verse is a blast of a film and I am going to give it a 9.7/10"
"msamiuddin98","10","29","54","19 December 2018"," Speechless!!!!

"u-66754","10","28","52","24 December 2018"," The most impressive animation this year, and a feast for comics fans !!
","This must be the most impressive animation for me this year and the whole movie is beyond my imagination!<br/><br/>Sony and Columbia really have done a great job, the music, the scenes and the spot are really excellent. As a crazy comics fan (both Japanese comics and American comics), the expression of this movie undoubtedly wins my heart. At first I was a little worried about the fusion of 3-D and 2-D and lower frames, the finished movie completely removes my worry, even I prefer this form than common animation! At the beginning of the movie, I was not into the mood of it and felt kind of strange. Then getting used to it, I felt like I was in a huge comic book. Every scene's just so fascinating, like a page of a comic book. Of course if you are more used to reality TV shows and movies, you may not like this expression XD.<br/><br/>The fusion of comics in this movie, to a certain extent, is a supplement for limitation of 3-D animation. It is hard to directly (visually) show the inner side of a scene in a pure 3-D animation. The word it posts, the switching color it shows, extremely enhance the sense in that scene, such as the shot part. I think Disney's 3-D animation is more and more pursuing the sense of reality, and it is sophisticated to copy the sense of exaggeration, which is easily conveyed in a 2-D animation movie. Hope that more companies can consider more innovative expression of animation, instead of making orthodox animations all the time.<br/><br/>Back to the movie itself, under excellent background music, the narrative, the pace, the characters and emotional expressions are great, better than some superhero movies. The main topic is absolutely ""Expectations"", and the whole movie clings close to it. Miles yearns for Spider-Man and shoulders expectations from his mates. Conflicts between father and son, Peter and MJ are solved in the end. The description of growing, friendship, family and love is very touching, thanks to excellent music and pace-controlling.<br/><br/>Somehow I perceive kind of shadow of Japanese animation, don't know it is my illusion or because of Peni Parker XD. I think Sony is suitable for this kind of movies.<br/><br/>As defects, maybe this kind of expression is not suitable for some audiences. Such as dizziness in the background, I'm fascinated by this unique style personally, but I find some people think it makes them dizzy. And the plot in the middle part is kind of disfluent and averaged.<br/><br/>And, hardly count it as a defect, the final fight is so so so gorgeous and extraordinary! I was completely captured by the switching color in the background and could not focus on the fight! (My bad!!)<br/><br/>In general, I really adore this movie and hope you all guys can watch it!"

"KeimoLantio","Null","21","38","2 March 2019"," Slapstick for the ADHD-generation
","The visual style is unique and impressive, but choppy movement caused by dropping the frame rate in order to make CGI look more like hand-drawn animation. There's just too much of everything all the time. The creators should take more time and build ambience and atmosphere. The constant visual fireworks feels like an ADHD nightmare.<br/><br/>The overabundance of childish slapstick comedy gets old really fast. Too bad the creators didn't have more ambition for more compelling writing. Miles Morales is a one-dimensional and uninteresting character. Then again, that's Brian Michael Bendis' fault."

","Dear Marvel fans, since I knew Spider Gwen is dubbed by my idol Hailee Steinfeld, I really wanted to watch this Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse movie. Then happily I did watch it and my review is just short: This movie is a fascinating graphic that please your eyes! Take a very big applause for artistic department and all team that make the idea of parallel universe could be combined with the original story of Spiderman. The identity, friendship, battles, family relations of Peter Parker became clear enough for the whole story of Spiderman series itself. How we ever knew about him, what is going on in his world, and when Spiderman transform himself to be a hero, is explained more here, and with the special appearances of Kingpin and his villain team, the director could lead the plots into the fun way for everybody. This is not just ordinary cartoon, but the highly qualified design graphic with the exact scenes, special effects, and bubble conversation like a moving comic-book. Every details in this animation is clearly edited by professional film-makers with any mistakes, nor any flaws. Even for Spiderman fans, this movie is so fresh to be watched and stays in his original starting point. No matter how many Spiderman movies could ever be made, this Spiderverse perhaps the first sci-fi animation I've ever watched and what a fascinating graphic to win Golden Globe very soon. And yes, I listen carefully of what Spider Gwen said because it is dubbed by my idol, Hailee Steinfeld, who will win many awards ahead. Thank you producer, director, casts, and crew to deliver this amazing movie to us."

"classicsoncall","7","15","26","2 January 2019"," ""What would I do if I were me?""
","Uh-oh, I feel a 'here I go again' coming. As I write this, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is ranked #29 on IMDb's list of Top 250 movies of all time, right there in between ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""LÃ©on: The Professional"". Among the eighty plus comic-book based super-hero movies I've seen and reviewed, it comes in at #2, right behind ""The Dark Knight"", which means viewers give it a higher rating than ""Avengers: Infinity War"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", if any of you Marvel fans care about that. I don't know, I just think there's just something askew about that, instinctively telling me that in this case, it's not the quality of the movie that places it so high in the rankings, but the overall popularity and buzz that attaches itself to the film. But enough of that.<br/><br/>I actually thought the film was OK, not great, but OK. As far as animated movies go, I thought it was exceptionally rendered with bright, vivid colors and an interesting cast of characters, some of whom I was familiar with and others not. I actually do remember Spider-Ham from the dark recesses of my memory long ago. As far as the story line goes, it wasn't particularly new or innovative, how many threats to reality have you encountered over the course of your movie viewing lives? If it sounds like I'm trashing the flick, I'm not really, I think it's great for kids and fans of animated movies. Speaking of which, and relative to my argument above, the picture is outranked by the Japanese anime ""Spirited Away"" on the current Top 250 at Number #27, so I'm not bashing the picture for not being live action.<br/><br/>My biggest kick out of watching the movie, and I make this statement a lot about Marvel based comic book movies, was seeing writer and artist Stan Lee drawn into the film as a store clerk named appropriately enough, 'Stan'. With his recent passing at the age of ninety five, it saddens me to know that I won't be seeing him in those ubiquitous cameo spots that I always look for in a Marvel super-hero film. As one of the original creators of Spider-Man along with Steve Ditko (who also passed away in 2018), I'd like to think that Stan Lee got his own special preview showing of ""Into the Spider-Verse"" before he entered Valhalla. He is one that will be missed."

"Tivanboven","10","14","25","22 December 2018"," All I ever wanted
","In the midst of all the raving reviews, I almost feel like a fraud giving this film such a high score. However, for me personally, this does what it needs to do and more. Let it be known that I used to watch the Spider-Man cartoon in the 90s nearly every day so yes, I am influenced by nostalgia.<br/><br/>Animation
I don't think that a lot of people can deny that this is the most interesting, dynamic and artistic animation which stays true to the original medium yet. When I first saw the comic book text and thought bubbles in the trailer, it kind of put me off a little bit, but it wasn't used throughout the film, only to depict Miles' newly developed awareness. I can see how the neon colours can induce headaches for some, but to me it was perfect. Maybe take an aspirin before going in if you're probe to headaches!<br/><br/>Story
There are so many things to love! Granted, I'm not a comic book reader (contemplating to get into that thanks to this though) so all of the stories were fresh to me. I loved that (big spoilers ahead!) Miles' universe's Peter Parker actually dies in the first act. This gives great motivation to an otherwise uninterested Miles, shows the need for a vigilante, stars Miles' dad's character arc, shows the danger that Kingpin poses, allows for aunt May to show her strong side (nice change of pace from the classic worried old lady) among others. Even Kingpin's motivation can be sympathised with. I agree that the other henchmen, who are normally fully fledged bad guys, could get some more backstory though. However, for veterans of the series, the fanservice is gold. (Did anyone else get excited when doctor Olivia revealed her last name?)<br/><br/>All in all I'd say that this is a masterpiece. But does it still the hunger for any other rendition of Spider-Man? No, so -1 point there."

The last thing to say: I belive the film is overvalued. Yes, it is beautiful, new generation, so to say, BUT, I can't agree that this film has the right to stay in line with one of the best films in the World.

Everything about this film, the beautiful animation, voice-acting, character development, and music are top notch. You can tell that the people behind this movie actually care about Spider-Man and care about their craft. From hilarious references to touching storytelling, this movie is just a joy to watch. It's such a unique addition to the genre and indicates that as long as talented people are involved in making these films, the superhero genre will continue to reinvent itself."
"Artylo","6","6","9","28 August 2019"," Aesthetically Impressive, but Nothing More Than Another Origin Story
","To preface this review, one ought to know that review will not be from the perspective of an avid superhero aficionado but rather from a viewpoint of one with little to no exposure when it comes to the Spider-Man comic books, graphic novels or anything besides the Sam Raimi film trilogy and the 1994 animated series for that matter. As such, there won't really be any discussion as to the quality of adaptation when it comes to characters and how they relate to existing plot lines as compared to those of the film; however, to compensate, that would contribute to a more objective viewing of the picture on its own merits. Also of note, the film was viewed in 2D through the digital home release and not the 3D version in theatres.<br/><br/>Of course, there is no denying that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of the most aesthetically impressive animated features of quite some time. Everything from the models, to the lighting, to the shading is made with immense artistry and lends itself nicely to the diegesis of what an animated comic book would look like if one were to exist inside it. While the animation itself has its flaws in terms in terms of consistency, there was a noticeable and considerable effort put into the use of shaders in effects such as chromatic aberration, the simulation of halftone patterns in the flares of lighting and hatching instead of flat colour shading; while the animation makes use of some classical techniques, such as squashing and stretching movement, shifting between 3D and 2D through rotoscoping, and motion smearing. One could point to the visual fidelity of the film as its strongest asset - and it most definitely is; however, one could easily gloss over some of the inconsistencies, owing themselves to the bewildering amount of framerates at play in some of the scenes. The production company behind the animation process cites a variation from 24 to 14 frames per second, which some have attributed as a stylistic choice to represent a form of character development throughout the plot as movement becomes less bold and more fluid along the hero's journey. However, on first viewing, the initial minutes of the film's runtime were quite the eyesore, requiring some adjustment before being able to completely immerse oneself in the experience. Human vision still processes images individually at around the 10 to 12 mark and even if these 14 frames of animation are done ""on twos"", it feels like a slideshow most of the time. What especially makes this jarring is that two characters can be animated using two different framerates in the same scene, which would usually be a massive red flag.<br/><br/>One other contentious aspect of the film is its music. The influence of the east coast hip-hop culture is written into the DNA of the protagonist and the film's setting, and the soundtrack reflects that by making liberal use of licensed music, featuring heavy breakbeats with an electronic flair. Daniel Pemberton's score is a more classical offering, mixing orchestral and synthesized sounds to elevate moments of humor or tragedy, but taking influence from 70's funk, as well as more eastern or ragtime infused bits from different styles of animation. The main failing of the soundtrack is the use of the aforementioned licensed tracks, as they usually play over dialogue. These tracks, coming from a style of music which values quick and high tempo vocals doesn't match with the slower more narrative pace of the underlying dialogue and ends up overpowering it, making the dialogue hard to hear. The instrumental score makes great use of leitmotifs and gives every character their own theme with about 2-3 variations, which usually get played with good timing in moments of distress, surprise or in the many comedic points throughout the film, and it usually made more of an impression than the licensed tracks that just seemingly bound the main character to a stereotype more than anything.<br/><br/>The main weak point of the film is perhaps its plot development. To be brief, the film has too many characters to sufficiently develop any of them into anything more than a single archetype with slight variations. Even in the script (now available publicly), once can notice the emphasis on allusions to pop culture tropes and internet memes as a nod to veteran fans of the series, rather than an attempt to establish something more meaningful. In its defense, it does make strides on being free of the now clichéd origin story of Spider-Man, however it also makes a point to repeat it three more times than usual, rendering the whole effort of being brief and self-aware pointless, as it would have taken up about the same runtime as just going through with it in its entirety in the first place.<br/><br/>The events of the film take place in two days in their entirety, including massive character-defining shifts in confidence, ability and skill as well as long term relationships forming over a mere few hours. In the end this makes any growth from any character appear as if they embody a Marry Sue/Larry Stu archetype, who develops whatever the plot requires to progress almost instantly. Tragedies take place, which feel like obvious tear-jerker moments for characters we've merely known for a whole 10 minutes, seemingly requiring at least some familiarity of the source material or a long term devotion to the series as a fan to grasp the severity of their plight. Alongside that, characters appear in and out of places at the plot's convenience, ruining any idea of continuity, especially near the end. Even so, the relationships between the characters only have an effect in the aftermath of the main conflict, uninfluenced by everything that has happened, as if these paradigm shifts in their personal lives were going to happen regardless of their presence in the events of the film. No one ever really grows in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse; the closest thing being an equivalent to a B-plot of a parent drifting away from their child, which ultimately gets played for laughs.<br/><br/>The screenplay follows The Hero's journey to the last letter, only differing in the many references it makes to other properties of the Spider-Man franchise, which show up sporadically throughout the events of the film. Even the idea of the ""Mentor"" is present, but effectively thrown out of the window, since the trials and failures, the growth of new skills and the death and rebirth of the main protagonist happen in one single scene, skipping an entire essential quarter of the journey.<br/><br/>Everything in the plot moves with such haste that it has no time to go anywhere. By the halfway point of the film's runtime it is still tying up the loose ends of its inciting incident. As said before, it has too many characters that get introduced too quickly and in bulk. Drama is experienced and is immediately forgotten, since there is no time to dwell upon it. Motives are not questioned and are washed away.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a shining display of the skills of the talented artists and animators who worked on it, but they are used on a film with little to no direction, except for repeating the same clichés it aims to subvert in a franchise that is already becoming oversaturated by its own offerings in an attempt to reinvent itself for a modern audience, relying purely on fan-service and relatable pop culture references. It boasts a colourful cast of characters which it spends little to no time developing due to the haste with which the plot moves in an incredibly small timeframe of events. Ultimately, an experience that is pleasing to the eye with its skillful execution, but vapid in substance due to poor screenwriting choices. Nothing more than another origin story."

The only reason I didn't leave one hour into the movie is because my companion fell asleep and i didn't want to wake them up, but the movie is also painfully long.

"alexthegreat350","10","23","47","14 December 2018"," Shattered my expectations!!
","My expectations were pretty high, I knew this film was gonna be good, but not THIS good. I mean I could give this film a 10 on animation alone. Its bright colors, fluid movements almost like a music video, and those comic book text boxes across the screen were a brilliant artistic choice. I realize that with movies like this the more obvious aspects like amazing action and visuals can make me not even think about the amazing character relationships and dialogue. The triangle between Miles, Jefferson an his uncle(sorry I forget lol) felt very realistic and grounded. Miles had a specific soft spot for his uncle, which was explored early on in the film. I really enjoyed how Jefferson wasn't a hardass annoying dad, and he wasn't a softie. He was just a guy, that wasn't 100% sure how to reach out to miles, but that didn't matter because he was doing his best. Also the talent from the amazing voice acting cast was undeniable. As a huge big mouth fan I kept finding myself laughing at John Mulaney as Peter porker. Not to mention they got Nicholas cage, who felt very natural for Spider noir. Who doesn't love that guy. I was pretty happy to see the concept of the multiverse explored in this movie, and I loved the brief, but still unique and interesting takes on each of the characters universe. I would love to see a solo movie for one of these characters, but I feel like thats a bit of stretch. I also want to talk about the most grabbing and probably the best aspect fo this film, the incredible visuals. I have always been a fan of animated films and TV, because with animation, there is not creative limit. Those limits, or lack there of is clearly on display for a majority of this film. Some of the shots and scenes (Especially the final act) just look like they would be incredibly difficult and/or expensive to film in live action. Not impossible though of course because we all saw ""Avengers: Infinity War."" Any-who I was constantly looking up at the screen in awe as I watched these beautifully animated and well developed swinging around the screen. I really enjoyed watching miles grow from not knowing what he was doing at all do understanding and really feeling his powers, with the help of Peter Parker. Speaking of Peter and Miles, I love the kind of relationship they shared, almost comparable to a really cool teacher and a student who desperately anted to learn everything. Overall this film had Excellent characters and character building, stunning visuals, beautiful animation, amazing cast, and an amazing script with dialogue that felt like a real conversation, and at times, very very funny. Point is go watch this movie ASAP it truly is a spectacular, colorful, work of art."

Is the personality that matters). I found Miles dislikable, as well as Peter D. (Or B?) Parker. Other characters didn't have enough screen time to show any personality. It was long, boring, and the humor wasn't as good as other SpiderMan content. I had to force myself to watch it to the end because I already paid for it, and well, maybe it'd get better at the end. It didn't. I guess I can't understand the hype."

"crpetersen","8","2","2","28 September 2019"," Underwhelmed, but not bad at all
","Going into this movie, I had high expectations. The amount of hype this movie got upon release, the positive critic reviews, and my friends praises towards it already made me wonder how good this movie could really be, and then I saw that it won an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and a BAFTA award. So yeah, as I said, I had high expectations. And I'm not gonna lie, I was slightly underwhelmed.<br/><br/>From what I saw in the trailer, movie posters, and from what I heard from friends, I knew that this was going to be a really visually stunning movie. And it was. The visuals were easily the best thing about this movie, they were not only masterfully created, but set the perfect theme for the movie. They really made me feel like I was watching a comic book that was magically turned into a movie, and I'm so glad that this isn't just another boring 3D animated movie.<br/><br/>Now for the story. It's essentially about a handful of differently themed Spider-Mans, who have to get back to their own dimensions, except for one of them, our main character. Their obstacle, the movie's antagonist, is a giant man, called Kingpin, who lost his family in a car accident. Kingpin wants to get his family back using a huge machine, which will doom the entire planet if he uses it. And I don't want to say more, otherwise I'll spoil it, but I'll still talk about my opinions. I think the introduction of new Spider-Men, or Spider-People, is really fun and creative, and I think that Kingpin is a fantastic, honestly scary, villain. But what I don't like is the way they have to stop Kingpin: they just have to press a button on the machine, then they save the world. It's awfully simple, I don't think I have to explain how silly it is, and why I dislike it. If there was a more complex goal, this movie would've probably been a lot better.<br/><br/>Now that the most important topics are out of the way, I'm gonna address the comedy in this movie. There are a few laughs, some flat jokes, but what I'm happy with is how the comedy isn't distracting at all, except for one time, with Spider-Ham, in the climax of the movie, but that was a pretty good joke, not gonna lie.<br/><br/>The music is pretty solid, using hip-hop was a good choice, as it really gave the movie a good flow and tempo. There's not much else to be said about it, other than my opinion, which is that some of the songs were fairly good.<br/><br/>I'm gonna finish this review by saying that I hoped to watch a movie I could at least give a 9/10, but was a little disappointed. Nevertheless, it was still a solid, good movie, and I didn't waste my time at all. Would recommend to people who ask."
"digitalbeachbum","5","2","2","4 July 2019"," Funny and light
","I think this is a fun and silly movie about Spider Man and not to be taken too seriously. The action is quick and almost all non-stop, but the pig as a spider I think was a bit too much. I get the multiverse stuff and technically or mathematically every version of Spider Man should exist, including a ghost Spider-Man or a robotic version.<br/><br/>There are some fun bits in the background if you look, like the Spider-Man dune buggy which I had when I was a kid. There is even a Stan Lee cameo which is cool, his last.<br/><br/>Overall its fun, but it isn't great. They couldn't have raised the bar a bit more and made a movie by paying attention to the details."
"andrewburgereviews","8","2","2","30 April 2019"," If there exist infinite dimensions, this would still be cool in all of them
","The triple, yes, triple directed (Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman) ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" runs like a comic-book from the year 3019, a mostly stop-motion animation style executed to a revolutionary level, but also mixing noir, anime and freaking Looney Tunes-inspired cartoons. It's one of the best films ever when it comes strictly to animation, every frame filled with clever pop culture references of which I probably missed most.<br/><br/>Albeit, this is a very stylized film, even for an animation. Young, chic and cool as hell, this is a blast to watch from start to finish and, thankfully, the style does not get too much in the way of substance. But this film does not go too deep in the feel department, although for something that looks this cool and restless I was mostly satisfied with the treatment for its characters. They all lost someone or something, including the villain here, which is Wilson Fisk a.k.a. Kingpin (Liev Schreiber) even though the film does not treat him with the same sympathy as the heroes. You must argue that this is normal, and it would be, but by the end I felt for the big guy.<br/><br/>But indulge me as I get back to the animation. Its quality resides not only in its ans-amble look, but also in the design of its characters. I am still amazed by Kingpin's gargantuan look, spawning a black suit and tie with a white shirt and his imposing bald head stuck in the middle looking asymptotically close to a parody, yet it wasn't. This extreme design creates an intensity and pace that never really stops, not even in the film's quieter moments.<br/><br/>Between the ""you can do this"" and ""believe in yourself"" teenage angst there are many fourth wall moments, most notably the way it parodies previous Spider-Man materiel, especially a certain dance in the street. There is a lot of fan service here as this film's ultimate point is to symbolize Spider-Man as an ideal rather than a person. But Spider-Man is not worthy of something like this. He is too stylish and not morally complicated enough, but the effort was visible and admirable.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a hip, creative teenager with big dreams and it does not have enough patience to involve itself emotionally too much. But it pays you back with every single frame. If you are a fan of animation, this is a must-see."

Comic fans can enjoy the amount of details included for them, while general audiences still understand who the good guys vs the bad guys are without a huge backstory for each character. The different Spider-People (Persons of Spider?) could all carry their own films, showing off drastically different art styles & a great voice cast. The animation is some of the most uniquely stunning visuals I've seen on screen, looking like comic book pop-art brought to life with newsprint texture, dialogue bubbles, & fluid motion. The writing is tight with plenty of heart & tons of laughs. It's a coming of age tale about a teenager who doesn't necessarily want to be a hero but feels that he's the only one who can in his realities time of need.

I hope we more movies with the characters of Spider Gwen, Miles Morales, and Spider Man Noir to name a few. It has a great story, telling us about things in case we get stuck in sub plot. Now I it differs a little from the comic. But I expect a lot of times in comic book movies. Hope to see more Spider Verse movies in the future."
"krishkhatiwada","8","10","18","19 December 2018"," Incredible animation and a well executed story
","Summary: MUST WATCH in cinemas. Do not watch this movie on your little phone or laptop.<br/><br/>You have probably already noticed everyone talking about how amazing the amimation is, and all of it is 100 percent true. I find it hard to describe the animation and be able to justify how amazing it is, so go witness it for yourself on a big screen. The movie is funny and ""over-the-top"" in the best way possible. Soundtrack is really good.<br/><br/>Pros:
All the characters are surprising well developed considering their unequal screen time, but off course this is Miles Morales' story first and foremost and he gets to shine. His arc is great and the ending to this arc is executed really well.
All supporting characters are well thought out and have their own moments to shine.<br/><br/>Con:
I felt that a few emotional beats failed to really hit me, and be totally invested in Miles' story.<br/><br/>All in all, Spider-Man: Into the spiderverse is an awesome movie to watch and I hope we get to see this type of animation further developed and used."

","Most avid moviegoers know that in order to find a truely great movie you avoid 2 things ; superhero blockbusters and Nicholas Cage. This movie happens to be excellent whilst falling under both of the above mentioned categories.
It had excellent rhythm and manages to speed through the Spidermans' overworked origin story.
Don't watch it if you're unable to appreciate the artwork."
"kjproulx","10","40","93","11 December 2018"," Possibly the Best Spider-Man Feature Film Ever Made
","Growing up, I grew an appreciation for the character of Spider-Man that I've never been able to develop for any other comic book character. It was Sam Raimi's original live-action trilogy that hooked me and had me scrounging for more. Watching countless episodes of every cartoon iteration, and even starting to read a few of the comics, I found myself becoming a huge fan of this generational icon. Once Spider-Man 3 hit theatres, the character had lost all hope on the big screen, until Andrew Garfield took the role from Tobey Maguire, which didn't last too long, and also crashed and burned. Finally, he found his footing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, played by Tom Holland, but none of that matters when watching Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Not only is this the best that this character has been in a while, but I believe there's a real argument to made that this is possibly the greatest feature-length film based on this character, period.<br/><br/>In this film, which is loosely based off of storylines that are very similar to how this movie plays out, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse follows Miles Morales as he's bitten by a radioactive spider and develops the same (and more) powers as his hero, Spider-Man. After an event opens a portal, it's revealed that his universe isn't the only one. There are endless dimensions out there with parallel characters and creatures, all with similar backstories. From Spider-Gwen to Spider-Ham, this film explores the classics as well as the bizarre, which I fear will probably turn off some average moviegoers who haven't experienced these characters yet, but if you can't embrace a film like that, it's probably not for you anyways.<br/><br/>From the very first teaser trailer, I was very intrigued by the look of this film and how different it looked from most animated films out there today. With only a couple of notable films in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Arthur Christmas, Sony Pictures hasn't had the best track record in terms of releasing animated movies theatrically. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has given new life to that notion, because this isn't only the best they've ever produced in my opinion, but it's the best animated movie that has come out all year. The unique style leaps off the screen and made me find another layer to love, on top of the fantastic storyline and characters surrounding it.<br/><br/>Yes, the origin story of Peter Parker is the one that everyone knows. That is very much present here again, and nearly every one of these characters share similar backgrounds, but it feels as though the filmmakers expect the audience to be in on the joke of that. This movie is very meta at times, and it works very well if you're invested in the movie as a whole. At the emotional core of this movie is how these characters differ from one another and how certain circumstances can be worse than others. There are some fantastic life lessons to be learned by children here, and for that, I only loved this movie even more.<br/><br/>In the end, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse impressed me on many levels. It gives you the Spider-Man action that you've come to expect from this character, as well as giving new life to it. The character of Miles Morales has just as many layers to his story as the classic Peter Parker one, but the inclusion of each one of the side characters here fleshes him out even more. This is one of the best superhero origin stories I've seen on the big screen in years. Filled with heart, emotion, plenty of action, and eye-candy as far as the eye can see, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is one of my favourite films of the year."
"oscaralbert","9","9","16","21 December 2018"," Since they conclude with Quantum Explosions . . .
",". . . and especially because they each opened in American theaters on December 14, 2018, viewers have naturally wondered whether MORTAL ENGINES and SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE tell the same story. The quick answer to this question is a simple ""Yes."" Let's examine some of the areas of congruence . The makers of MORTAL ENGINES and SPIDER-VERSE strive mightily to make their characters more ""diverse"" than a United Nations picnic. This is quite ironic, because these flicks emanate from New Zealand and Japan, two of the LEAST diverse, most homogenous places on Earth, with immigration policies that make the USA's current White House Occupant seem like a spiritual brother to the Statue of Liberty by way of comparison. However, SPIDER-VERSE deserves a higher satisfaction rating than MORTAL ENGINES because it celebrates a hallowed past (even after ALL of its end credits have rolled), while the latter flick runs out of gas desperately seeking to set up sequels which will rival HEAVEN'S GATE II, HOWARD THE DUCK QUACKS AGAIN, and ANOTHER ISHTAR when it comes to audience demand."

","If spiderman into the spiderverse wins, the academy will officially have fallen as low as they possibly can. It is ridiculous how marvel and producers are so greedy to even think about making a completely new movie about a character which is popular at the moment. The spiderman homecoming series hasn't even ended and they're already working on new projects about the same character. It just causes confusion and in my case disappointment. This is why the amazing spiderman series never got a final end. Sure, spiderman homecoming hit the box office quite good... but was it seriously necessary to do a movie with thousands of spidermen just to take advantage of the popularity the character has? I've always disliked marvel because of their lack of passion for filmmaking. They do huge budget movies every year which only take about 6 months too complete just for money. All the movies follow the same plotline. None of them are original. Its just remakes and sequels, one after another. Spiderman into the spiderverse has been the most ridiculous project so far."

My only, tiny complaint is that the villains weren't very fleshed out, but with the multiple Spider men and women needing adequate backgrounds and screen time, I can easily look past it.

Hopefully zero spoilers!
Let's start with the visuals - Sony have taken the game forward with this animation! It's breathtaking, beautiful and really is like you're watching a living comic book. It's visually stunning and defines the quality of this film from outset. Even the dots on the screen to represent the comic book style - amazing!<br/><br/>The story is so good and does justice to bring the Miles Morales story to the fore. Mixing the characters from the multiverse is done so well - all lovable given the right amount of screen time respectively.<br/><br/>It's genuinely funny - if no one laughs when you watch it then it's probably the zombie apocalypse - the jokes are heartfelt and honest. That's not to say that this film doesn't have the feels - it does - but used in the right way.<br/><br/>Finally - the music. We all know Post Malone is a genius and this soundtrack is epic - better than Kendrick Lamar's Black Panther - and used so well throughout the film.<br/><br/>This ia a wonderful film that will make you fall in love with or reaffirm your love for Spiderman while at the same time introducing Miles Morales as the future of the Spider-verse.<br/><br/>Stay for both post-credit scenes - worth it. Also look out for Stan Lee's cameo in the film - emotional."
"Phil_M_A_Kerr","9","10","19","19 December 2018"," Spidey-sense very common in this radioactive spin on the web-slinger
","Using misaligned colour templates, like 3D without the glasses, for portions of the screen that were out of focus was a bold step. Bring them together and our eye is drawn to that now sharp part of the screen whilst everything else goes out of focus, or rather misaligned. What a different way to direct the audiences' eyes. Maybe a subliminal nod to the existence of parallel realities.
Like all good PG animations, the creators build a bit more depth into the narrative which makes the film a coming-of-age tale, leading the young viewers into the world beyond. Despair and faith, loss and hope, and all those adulty type themes are threaded through this three-dimensional ... no, MULTI-dimensional tale.
It is a silky-smooth incorporation of comic book panels, colours, and shading into a big screen motion picture.
The city slicker wit had me laughing out loud aplenty although it is occasionally too clever for this semi-rural simpleton.
This was a Tuesday night 9:30pm session with about a dozen adults and no kids so it was probably wasted somewhat without its target audience. Nevertheless, it is good to see the PG-rated teen animated epic is in capable hands.
When I was a lad we had epics like Watership Down, the Mouse Trap to enthrall is over the Festive period. I hope Into The Spiderverse delivers just as well to the current generation."

","We've got Peter Parker. We've got web-shooters. We've got a group of villains called ""The Sinister Six"". Yep, we've got a Spider-Man movie again. It used to be we would go several years between the further adventures of New York's web slinger. Now were going months. In fact, Spider-Man had a big part of the MCU epic Avengers: Infinity War back in May. So what's going on in December that requires an additional movie? You'd be surprised by how vast the comic world is that does justify another movie.<br/><br/>Like how many people have played a particular superhero, many people have played Spider-Man aside from Peter Parker. One popular addition is of another New York kid named Miles Morales. He garnered phrased for being the first half African-American, half Puerto Rican character to play a superhero. He was also noted for taking Spider-Man back to a youthful demeanor as Peter Parker in the story was getting a little old. But it doesn't stop there. There's also Spider-Woman, Silk, Spider-Noir, and even an anthropomorphic pig called Spider-Ham who operates on cartoon logic. While we don't exactly get all of them, we do get a bunch of them, along with an origin story for Miles in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.<br/><br/>Young teenager Miles Morales (played by Shameik Moore) is adjusting to a new life at a prestigious boarding school academy, at the insistence of his cop father Jefferson (played by Brian Tyree Henry) who wants a better life for his son. Miles wants to impress his parents, but finds comfort in his more free spirited uncle Aaron (played by Mahershala Ali). One night, while the two of them do some graffiti art in a hidden area of the subway, not only does Miles get bitten by a spider, but also witnesses a battle and death of the popular Peter Parker Spider-Man while spotting Kingpin (played by Live Schreiber) working on a large machine that takes affect.<br/><br/>Like Peter Parker's story, Miles starts to notice changes like sticking to walls and spider senses. He visits Peter's grave to think about what to do next. Its here where an older Peter Parker (Played by Jake Johnson) meets him and asks for help to help him return to his own dimension. While uncovering plans from Kingpin to open several dimensions, Miles also comes across Spider-Gwen (Played by Haile Steinfeld), Spider-Noir (Played by Nicolas Cage), Peni Parker (played by Kimiko Glenn) and her robot, and Spider-Ham (played by John Mulaney) who all help figure everything out.<br/><br/>As you can see, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse juggles a lot and almost makes the mistake of cramming too much for one movie. Amazingly, the script not only keeps every character listed above in check, but also makes it a great story for young Miles Morales. If your worried that this is another origin story, this is one that puts a lot of focus of Miles and his relationship with his father and uncle. I can't disclose why, but it really creates new pressure that Peter Parker never had to face.<br/><br/>In terms of the rest of the characters, I really like this side to Peter Parker that we had yet to get from the other adaptations; a Spider MAN. A man whose gone through so much and had his heart broken several times, that he's more of a broken hero that needs fixing himself. His story balanced out well with Miles. He also gets a good scene involving the aunt May of this universe, almost like seeing a living ghost that was very sweet. While I don't want to give too much away, each Spider person gets their own arc as they navigate their way through Mile's world.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the animation, which looks great. Rather then going for a Pixar/DreamWorks look, this Spider-Man story has a comic book-look that takes advantage of that fact, along with that it's also animated. Unlike a lot of live action movies where use of computers can occasionally be distracting if not done well, it all blends well, especially with the action sequences. The angles remind me of the comic pages I still turn, given the use of color and word bubbles, that never become annoying, and are used accordingly to amplify the drama and comedy. This is a movie with the rare distinction where it's all it's own.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten Spider-Man comics out of ten. This was a fun and different Spider-Man movie that we needed, even more then Spider-Man: Homecoming. It could come off as too weird for some, but given the story's focus is still on this kid's growth as a hero and a teenager, it never felt overwhelming. It was an odd example of everything accidently fitting into piece. This is an absolute recommendation. Swing in and go see it."

","This movie was really good! This is a fresh take on Marvel that we have not really seen before when it comes to a PG cartoon. This was unique and stylish and very comicy and was incredible! The Spider group made the film for me! Liev Schreiber was GREAT as Wilson Fisk! This is the first film with Nicolas Cage where I actually dug him! Everything else I have seen him in is either overrated or just ok, but I really enjoyed his role in this and hope this makes for a comeback in his career, considering for years he has been in some STRANGE movies but he worked well in this! Noir Spiderman is actually a really neat take on Spiderman! This film does things in such unique style! I mean, Peter Porker and an anime Spider character! Holy cow! This film pulls you in and doesn't let go till the credits! The story is wonderful and very personal, the characters are wonderful, the artsy style and animation is beautiful, the voice acting is legit! Go see this! It is about time Sony gets their act together and make good Marvel movies! Having an entire group sort of like the Avengers, consisting on incredibly unique Spider characters, CREATIVITY IS STILL OUT THERE! I really hope to see more of this group in the future, because they are a great team! I wish I could view this as a masterpiece but for some reason I do not. It is awfully close to it though!"

The themes of Self Identity and where we can differentiate Him with the other Spider-Men is heart of the film as it establishes this Miles as his own self, rather than another Peter clone in the Ultimate/Prime Universe(Of the Comics). The Comedic Relief didn't feel far off Noir portrayed by Nic Cage is a highlight, Peter Porker is a cartoon character what you'd expect and Peni Parker with Sp//dr (i prefer the Evangalion design of the original.) The Animation superb, The score and Soundtrack ultimately fitting (although some complain about the use of Scared in the Dark and yes it did feel off, but it didn't bother me that much. And one of note who disliked the soundtrack overall and preferred the score to be kept thought.), I have no complaints, i say this is the film to surpass Raimi's Spider-Man 2 from 2004."

","I Have loved the Spider-Man comics since being a kid, and have followed them for 40 years since.

At times the back ground was out of focus, i guess this is on purpose, but felt like badly edited 3D, but this didn't distract from the overall look at times it almost feels like a live action film.<br/><br/>It a fantastic storey which feels like its been ripped straight from the comics. It is jammed packed with the proper Spidey humour, and gives us the usual moral questions which makes up every great Spidey Character. There is great action sequences throughout, and you do get invested in the main characters emotional journey.<br/><br/>It has everything a great Spider-movie should have, but you get more Spidey for your $$. If your a fan of the whole Spider-verse thing have patience and wait till the end credits it is worth the wait."

"YungTrashcan","8","4","6","27 December 2018"," The best Spider-Man movie.
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an excellent movie, debatably the best Spider-Man movie (although I haven't re-watched Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 in a while) and so far the best movie I've seen all year.<br/><br/>The story is fairly standard for a Spider-Man movie, social outcast teenager (except this time Miles Morales instead of Peter Parker) has a bad relationship with his father, struggles to fit in at school, through a sequence of events becomes bitten by a radioactive spider, and uses his new-found powers to fight crime. However what this movie does to stay fresh is introduce the idea of multi-verses, which leads to all these different versions of Spider-Man (most notably aging Peter Parker and Spider-Woman) working together, and what that amounts to is a really great tribute to Spider-Man and all of his different comic book interpretations. I don't even read comics and I was really impressed with what was on screen, they even pay tribute/make fun of scenes in previous Spider-Man movies, like the notorious dancing segment in Spider-Man 3 (reminds me of The LEGO Batman Movie, another animated superhero film I really enjoyed).<br/><br/>This movie also has some of, if not the best 3D animation I have ever seen, putting even the most recent Pixar movies to shame. It's not surprising that Phil Lord and Chris Miller, (who made Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and The LEGO Movie) worked on this movie, considering those are some of the most creative CG animated movies in recent memory. The movie is literally like watching a comic book read in front of you, there's text that appears in the corners of the screen exactly like a comic, lines that characters say follow them as they're walking around and even something as little as someone throwing a bagel at someone else have these cute sight gags which I honestly don't even want to spoil. I could talk about how great the stylization is in this movie for hours so I'll just leave it at that it's worth seeing the movie for this aspect alone.<br/><br/>The story didn't exactly reinvent the superhero movie formula but for this movie it worked and there were tons of things about the script that played out in a really interesting way. Some of which I've already mentioned (like the tribute to the different versions of Spider-Man) but also the character of Miles Morales and the chemistry between him and Peter Parker. Miles needs a teacher to help him hone his powers, but Peter Parker is lazy and doesn't want to teach him, so that creates this interesting conflict where you wonder if he's even going to understand his powers by the end of the film. The movie also focused on the morality of Spider-Man, and whether or not vigilantes have a place in society, which felt like an idea that was left pretty much untapped in the prior Spider-Man movies, so despite the fact that this is a family movie it raises more mature ideas and themes than even the more adult entries in the Spider-Man series.<br/><br/>As well as all of the above, the humour felt smart; there were tons of funny quips and character exchanges which I really appreciated, the film has a great soundtrack (a lot of hip-hop music that gives the movie a more urban vibe that the other movies didn't have) and the voice acting is really strong, my favourite performance being Nicolas Cage as Spider-Man Noir. Really the only problem I had with the movie was Kingpin, I thought his character's backstory was sympathetic but when it came to his motivation it didn't feel fully fleshed out.<br/><br/>Really though this is one of the best comic book movies of the past ten years. It's beautifully animated, funny, and has a really strong story that in some areas is more adult than any of the other Spider-Man films. It has a true understanding of the character of Spider-Man and after leaving the cinema I was reminded of why I love movies. I honestly wasn't even expecting that much and I can't sing its praises enough."

Shouldn't this be like Amazon -- you have to be a verified viewer to submit a review. I mean, who are you kidding with a couple hundred 10's? Does anyone really believe those people who use the same view words to describe every show they review: Best Ever!, Perfect! Fantastic! My favorite of the series!
Then they proceed to use the same patented comments as if they wrote one review and used it for a dozen films.
The last clue is when a show had the rave reviews from the critics. When is the last time critics actually got a review (for an average Joe/Jane movie goer) right?
So we did sit through it, suffering a string of insults for being white and the usual teenage writer jokes. It wasn't the worst movie, but it certainly was not the 'Best Ever'."

","Apparently, the background in much of this movie is comic book pages which were printed with the blue and red inks not quite matching up. That made them ""fuzzy"". I found this very distracting, and by the time I had finished the movie, I was worn out. Also, there were endless chase scenes and endless superpowered- characters throwing other superpowered-characters around. The usual stuff, which I find silly. And it was long. And loud. I guess this entire genre is targeted at children. I found nothing interesting in this movie."

The different Spiderman/women even thought I know who they were but it was fun to see them in a short easy version of explaining their backstory in a very short time. The drama which is awesome ,which beats all the Spiderman movies on drama. This One is the king of Spiderman movies aside the Tobey Maguire trilogy and Andrew Garfield movies.

"jon.h.ochiai","10","7","13","24 December 2018"," Into the Spider-Verse: Take a Leap of Faith
","""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is astounding stylized state-of-art animation with the look and feel of 3-D Japanese Anime. The animation is visually shadowed and soulful with vibrant pastels. Not just mesmerizing eye-candy, team of Directors - Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman craft a fresh rites of passage narrative of immerging Spider-Man, half-African American Miles Morales, voiced by spirited and smart Shameik Moore. Although in Phil Lord (""The Lego Movie"" and ""22 Jump Street"") and Rodney Rothman's screenplay, Miles is one of several 'Spider-Men' and 'Spider-Women' intersecting in this Marvel superhero, sci-fi, family mashup.<br/><br/>Turns out that villain ""Kingpin"", voiced by malevolent Live Schreiber, the blockish hulking bald cartoon figure used his invention - the Super Collider to collapse the multiverse. To what ends? Honestly, I don't think even Phil and Rodney know. That might be beside the point. Because, ""Into the Spider-Verse"" is just raucous fun with a warped sense of humor and a big heart.<br/><br/>Directors Bob, Peter and Rodney introduce the Spider-Man in New York that we all know and love: Peter Parker, voiced by whimsical Chris Pine. He's the guy, who was bitten by the radioactive spider that gave him his amazing strength, agility and 'spidey sense' as in sixth sense. After an extended Superhero career of 22 years including his failed marriage to the love of his life Mary Jane, voice by Zoe Kravitz, Spider-Man dies as a Hero, doing what he loves to do: Saving others.<br/><br/>Miles is a teen attending a college prep school on scholarship: The brilliant computer geek, who chills to Post Malone. His Dad Jefferson Davis, voiced by stalwart funny Brian Tyree Henry, is a police officer, who not a big fan of Spider-Man and his ""along with great power comes great responsibility"" dogma. Somewhat self-absorbed, he unconditionally loves Miles. Jefferson even coerces Miles to say, ""I love you, Dad."" - in front of his entire school.<br/><br/>At school Miles is sweet on pretty smart blonde Gwen Stacy, voiced by wonderfully aloof Hailee Steinfeld. Their attraction is mutual. Miles derives security in his relationship with his Uncle Aaron, voiced with street gravitas by Mahershala Ali. Aaron and his brother Jefferson Davis are estranged, given Aaron questionable shady dealings. Yet, Aaron is the cool Uncle, who encourages Miles's distinct gift as the street tagger of amazing urban spray paint murals. While working one of his masterpieces, Miles is bitten by what looks like a radioactive spider. Consequently, Miles acquires his Spider-Man powers.<br/><br/>At the same time Miles meets his alter-dimensional persona in older paunchy Peter B. Parker, voiced by funny, mildly cynical Jake Johnson, who teaches Miles the ropes of Spider-Man's web-slinging. While escaping from Kingpin's facility and swinging through the snowy forests, Peter and Miles encounter sleek white suited Spider-Gwen - Gwen Stacy (Hailee). Turns out too, that Gwen is the Spider-Woman from yet another dimension. Like Peter, she also needs to return to her home dimension.<br/><br/>So it's up to Miles, who must wrestle control of Kingpin's Super Collider, to forge the dimensional pathway back to their respective dimensions. Meanwhile, Miles meets Spider-Men from other dimensions. Black and white Spider-Man Noir, voiced by off-the-wall Nicolas Cage, is from a past dimensional era. There's Warner Brothers-like cartoon Spider-Ham, voiced by hysterical John Mulaney. Life-size Japanese Anime Peni Parker, voiced by quirky Kimiko Glenn, is from the 31st Century sporting her advanced robotic Spider-Man. As Peter says, ""This could literally not get weirder."" Balancing this phase-glitched universe are versions of Spider-Man's villains: Green Goblin, Scorpion, and a few others that I don't recognize.<br/><br/>There is a whole lot of nonsense running amok in ""Into the Spider-Verse"", yet the directors resonate in asking, ""What makes a Hero?"" With surprising poignancy, cartoon Spider-Ham tells emerging Hero Miles, ""You can't save everyone."" Otherwise, the great responsibility and power become a curse.<br/><br/>When Miles has doubts that he can become the Hero, Peter tells him, ""Take a leap of faith."" Believe in the hero that's within all of us. Our Heroes arise from our belief from within, and from the love those who believe in us. For Miles that's the world-weary and wise Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker, and brave and compassionate Hailee Steinfeld as Gwen. Radiant Shameik Moore makes us believe that his Miles shall discover his own greater than self within.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is about summoning the Hero within all of us. Even more so than the amazing animation, that narrative makes ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" one of my favorite movies this year."

The movie just seemed to do everything right for me and I can't think of any flaws or really anything I have wrong with it, it's practically a flawless Spider-Man movie and the best comic book film of the year alongside Infinity War and also the best animated movie of the year and one of the best of the decade.<br/><br/>All the characters were very refreshing and a much needed change from previous comic book films and the humour and storytelling in it was just so fresh and entertaining. It was fun, creative, original and also very funny. I thought it was groundbreaking and is my favourite film of the year"

"piggulu","6","18","42","16 December 2018"," Split Personality
","Overall, I found the whole thing underwhelming. While the animation and comic book style is excellent, the movie suffers from a monumental case of identity. Excluding the parallel universe concept, it initially presents itself as grounded/realistic. Average kid just wanting to be a kid, etc. But then it heaps on unspectacular one-liners/physical gags reminiscent of old cartoons (Kingpin's design and Peter Porker) I felt like I was watching a Dreamworks animation film, and although I easily classify myself as ""young at heart"" and am always a fan of classic Looney Toons(Tunes?) I didn't find much particularly funny here. Which leads to the question: who is the main audience, young/older adults or primarily kids? It doesn't really play strength to either. Is the movie an ensemble film? Not really, Miles is so much the main focus that the rest of the could've been left out entirely or just appeared at the end and it probably would've made a tighter film. None of them get to personally shine or have a memorable moment. One can argue that's part of the charm of ""Anyone can wear the mask"" but I disagree.<br/><br/>Honestly, if it wasn't for the eye strain from the 3D then I most likely would've fell asleep."

"iamabossnotreally","8","9","18","19 December 2018"," The Best Spider-Man Film
","I had very high hopes for Into The Spider-Verse. After seeing it, it surpassed my expectations. The best part of the film is easily the animation. It has so much personality and style. I hope more animated films in the future use this style. There is also some deep and dark elements to the story as well. The film isn't scared to dig into some dark material instead of only trying to appeal to children, and I can commend it for that. Another great thing about this movie is the characters. Some of the side characters like Spider-Ham don't build that much as characters but they never seemed like lazy characters. They all have their own personality and add a lot to the film. The more fleshed out characters like Miles, Peter, and Gwen are one of the biggest surprises of this film. Most super hero films don't try to flesh out their characters and mostly just try to make them cool. This movie takes time in developing those characters to make them more likeable. Especially the process Miles went through in this film was really impactful. There are a few issues I have with this film though. For some reason, they blur out of the backgrounds for some of the shots which bothered me because since the animation was so amazing I wanted to watch the environment and take in the art. Although, it may have just been the theater screen I watched the film on. Another thing is that the film gets a little cheesy near the end, but nowhere near annoyingly cheesy. So, I would highly recommend seeing this film. It's my favorite super hero movie of the past years and my favorite Spider-Man movie."
"owkelly","10","9","18","18 December 2018"," Arguably the best Spiderman
","I first saw the trailer for this film, popcorn in hand, in the entrance of my local cinema waiting for my screening of 'Avengers: Infinity War'. At first I was scared for the investors of this film, thinking, 'Woah, an animated spiderman film? Surely this will be a flop.' I didn't change my thoughts on the film throughout the several months leading up to watching it. That is until five minutes into the opening scene. The rich, vibrant animation was an enigma to me at first. Swirling, spinning web-slinging (excuse the pun) spectacles and characters took a second to wrap my head around, but once the film had fully immersed me, I had been 'thwipped' to my seat.<br/><br/>Whenever I see a trailer for a film and I find it genuinely funny and not just in a, 'haha, hey, we should go see that' kind of way, I become worried. To me, a funny trailer indicates that all the best scenes have been used up in this promo, leaving a dull, bland shell of a movie that could have been funny. Add this to the fact that Sony Animations (creators of the dreadful 'Emoji' Movie) had produced 'Into the Spider-Verse' and you had a recipe, it seemed to me, for disaster. This was, however, in no way the case. The film had both Parody and Slapstick style comedy with a hint of Satire. Not to mention the hilarious references to various Spiderman Films and Comics.<br/><br/>You could really get behind all of the characters. Each were strong in their own field and presented a new style both in their characteristics and literally their true colours (Spiderman Noir's lack-of for example). This applied to the multiple villains as well. The new takes on Kingpin, Dr. Octopus, and Green Goblin were some of my personal favourites, plus the first time depiction of Prowler voiced by no less than the brilliant 'Mahershala Ali'. Obviously not his first Marvel Villain rodeo! If you are a fan of mid-film twists, 'Into the Spider-Verse' has got that fresh to order. I don't do spoilers, but I can tell you it will be a surprise to you.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe this film is one for the marvel history books. And hearing there is an sequel based around the female characters, I can say for certain that i will be rushing into theatres to see it."
"bigchrisdye-39927","10","9","18","17 December 2018"," One of the most fun animated movies of the year however one of the most violent
","Okay so originally I only went to see this due to the fabulous reviews but I wound up really enjoying it however with that being said the violence in the movie is hard core and I actually saw people leaving from the theater due to the extreme violence but it was a excellent movie"
"jg_1977","10","9","18","17 December 2018"," No, it's not over-hyped, it is that good.
","Wow. That's the only word that I was able to articulate after being blown away by Spider-Verse. Normally I write my reviews as soon after seeing the movie as possible, however this time, I needed to give myself a few days to make sure I wasn't just riding the high that the movie leaves you on, and that it actually was as well-made as I thought. A few days later and my thoughts haven't changed. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is not only the best animated movie of the year, it's also the best superhero movie of the year (and this is coming from someone who loved both Black Panther and Infinity War), and simply one of the best movies of the year period (not to mention the best Spider Man movie of all time). This film succeeds in every conceivable way: it's got well-written, compelling characters that are brought to life by superlative acting; the visuals are stunning and create the most immersive theater experience of the year; the action is thrilling and never gets repetitive; the story manages to be both completely groundbreaking while also paying homage to the Spider Man story we know and love; and best of all, the comedy is absolutely spot on, every single joke lands without feeling cheap or getting old. As good as this movie is across the board, I suspect it all stemmed from an impressively written screenplay. Not surprisingly, Phil Lord (and an uncredited Chris Miller), truly understands what people enjoy and relate to in the Spider Man story and brings that to the screen beautifully. What's accessible about the character of Spider Man is that he (or she) is just a normal kid who gets these extraordinary powers and learns to become a superhero. As great a character as Iron Man is, it's pretty hard for a child to relate to the hard-drinking billionaire who happens to fight crime. Spider Man is relatable because he is a superhero every person can see themselves becoming in those circumstances. And that is the thesis of this film. Anyone can be Spider Man. The introduction of the Spider-Verse actually serves this message and enhances the story, which is what made the movie so enjoyable. At no point did the multi-verse concept feel like a device for selling toys (ahem... Porgs), but instead was a natural way to set up Miles Morales. There are only two things I could think of that could get criticized in Spider-Verse, the first is its inaccessibility to people who don't like Spider Man or superheroes, and the second is its visual style might not work for everyone. To address the first issue, I suspect there will be people who think this movie is only entertaining for people who already enjoy Spider Man properties, but I strongly disagree. Taking the Spider Man aspect out of this film, there's still a lot of great storytelling at work. Within this movie is a coming of age story about a black-hispanic kid trying to fit into his almost all-white high school, a story about a father trying to relate to his son, a story about a man who has given up on life who needs someone younger and more hopeful to show him the way, and a damn good science fiction story about a multi-verse. All of these narratives work without the superhero aspect, and I think make this film completely accessible to someone who has never seen a Spider Man movie before. The second issue about the visual style I understand a bit more, as initially the visuals didn't work for me. The style is shaky and imperfect and I felt like I was watching a 3-D movie without glasses. However, I realized they meant for the look to be imperfect and rough around the edges, just like worn out comic book come to life. I think part of the problem is that in recent years, with Pixar and Illumination movies, animation has gotten so refined and smooth, that is was at first off putting to see something break out of that mold. But after about 30 minutes, my eyes adjusted and I was able to get absorbed into the world they created. In summary, Spider-Verse is a mesmerizing movie that is firing on all cylinders and absolutely succeeds. It's funny, smart, heartfelt, with a message that makes me feel as hopeful and optimistic as I did when I was a kid seeing Toby Maguire become Spider Man for the first time. If you love Spider Man, you will 100% eat this movie up, and if you don't already love the wall-crawling hero, you will by the end of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Go see this movie!"

"MarkyLouiG","10","9","18","17 December 2018"," I wouldn't be surprised if this would be nominated for an Oscar
","I am going to be blunt; this is one of the best animated films this year. First things first the animation is incredible. I love how the style that they went with, it looked cool and it's great to see something different from what we usually see from a lot of animations these days. The action that was portrayed looked phenomenal I am astounded by the work that Sony did in this film. The thing that struck me the most was the story of the film. It was honestly mature for an animation; it was serious when it needed to be serious, and it hits you hard. Every character has depth in this film. I know there are a lot of Spider people in this but I didn't feel that there was one of them that felt left out. Everyone had a chance to shine and a chance to develop properly. Even the main villain had depth in him and I massively impressed by it. And to top it all off this movie is funny as hell. You will walk out of the theatre with a massive smile on your face. There isn't a dull moment in this film.
All in all I thought this was a phenomenal film. I knew we already have a complicated universe when it comes to Spiderman but I wouldn't mind having an extended universe with this. Spider-gwen maybe or even Spiderham. It is an excellent film, and I wouldn't be surprised if this would be nominated for an Oscar and if would be, it is well deserved."

Trippy at times, the vivid colors of New York at night while spidey slings through it are mesmerizing.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't follow the same old Spiderman formula and brings the multiverse into the picture.<br/><br/>Characters are relatable, especially a 30 year old divorced Peter Parker. Other Spiderpeople in the movie are also interesting and the movie is full of pop culture references.<br/><br/>This movie has great potential to start an epic Marvel animated universe. *sigh* If only there was no dispute over character rights between studios."

"realgagechesteen","10","9","18","16 December 2018"," The Best Spider-Man Movie Yet!
","EXTRA WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!<br/><br/>This is the best Spider-Man movie yet. No, I'm not exaggerating. Spider-Man 2 is great and I absolutely love Spider-Man: Homecoming. But this film does a better job of bringing the Spider-Man universe to life than those two films (or any of the other Spider-Man films) ever did. Instead of making changes to make the character fit into the mainstream, it embraces all of the goofiness and heart that has been present in the comics for years. This film has more emotion than any Spidey flick has ever had. It has more heart than any film ever has had and it is funnier than any film.<br/><br/>Miles Morales is an absolutely fantastic protagonist and I love the parallels drawn between him and Peter Parker in this film. I found myself rooting for Miles more than I ever did root for Peter Parker in any other film. He never comes off as annoying (as Peter did in all three Raimi films, the two Webb films, and even in Homecoming). He's extremely likable and you just want to see him finally become the hero we all know he can be. Watching him discover his powers at the beginning of the film is really fun and you kinda feel bad for him. He's just fumbling around and it's really awkward for him.<br/><br/>The relationship between him and Peter is extremely heartfelt. Peter doesn't want to help Miles, but Miles wants nothing more than for Peter to help him learn how to become Spider-Man. It's not because Peter is a dick and just doesn't want to help, it's because he's depressed and has lost too much and he just doesn't want to get this young kid involved in his adventures. I kind of teared up when Peter went back to his dimension. I loved seeing their friendship develop, from the moment Miles' universe's version of Peter died.<br/><br/>Kingpin is a great villain and I really felt bad for him when I saw what happened to his family. He doesn't WANT to kill Spider-Man, but he will because Spider-Man is standing in between him and getting his family back. Prowler is also a fantastic villain, even though he really isn't a villain. His relationship with Miles was another great relationship in the film that made me love this so much. I was screaming (inside, obviously) when I saw him trying to kill Miles. He didn't know it was Miles and when he finally realizes, he's killed.<br/><br/>I could go on forever about the relationships in this movie but all you need to know is that every character relationship in this film is extremely well-developed and I loved seeing them all play out. Another standout is the relationship between Miles and his father.<br/><br/>All the other Spider-Men (and women!) are really fun to watch and are another key component in making this movie work. If it wasn't for Spider-Man Noir fiddling with a Rubix cube and Peni Parker having a giant robot spider, this film wouldn't work nearly as well as it does.<br/><br/>I'm running out of time but the last two things I'll say is that the animation is fantastic. I loved how it recreates the look of a comic book. That, and the voice cast does a great job. Also... that post-credits scene was perfect.<br/><br/>Go and see this movie. Seriously. Thank you Sony, for making up for the abomination that was Venom."
"augustdraper","10","9","18","15 December 2018"," This blew me away!!!
","I rarely ever make movie, but I had to on this one. I remember seeing the trailer for this and saying ""this lowkey looks bad."" Months go by and I start seeing reviews saying ""Best film of 2018"" This film is amazing"" so on and so on. Then I was like okay, I should go this. I saw yesterday with my film class and I blown away, like I mean blown away. The story was so well written, like certain foreshadowing and elements that came back in the end from the beginning. It was so well done. The relationships between Miles/Uncle Aaron and Miles/His father are super well done. It highlights the complexities of role modeling, which I love. Miles is such an authentic teenager and the way puberty is portrayed is too relatable in this film. Just the overall story was fantastic. The music works super well with the film, which always is something I appreciate. Sometimes, it gave me straight goosebumps for a solid 5 minutes. And let me tell you, the final fight scene!!!!!!! I'm not going to spoil it, but it's something the MCU could never pull off. It's one of the coolest fight scenes I've seen in a long time. Also, not to be political or anything, but this is the only film that I've seen where the friend zone is accepted. It's really a nice refresher of every movie that I have seen that always has the main character fall for the attractive female character. Overall, the entire blew my expectations out of the water. I was not expecting it to be this good.<br/><br/>There are only two things that are stopping me from giving this film a 10/10 is the middle part of the film. It kinda got slow for me but the first act and the third act really made up for it so I'm not really complaining. I also didn't like the Peni Parker character because I just found her annoying in like every scene she was in. However, This film is one of the best superheroes I've ever seen. Miles Morales is officially my favorite spider-man."
"ThE-STaRDoGG-CHaMPioN","1","27","68","4 March 2019"," Ignore the hype ...
","All the hype is just liberals trying to sell their ""diversity"" vision as usual. The movie is rather boring, rather annoying with it's cheesy, flashy, constantly moving (rapidly) abstract shapes in the background, like your average Japanese anime.

Quality and entertainment wise it's Saturday morning kid cartoon at best."
"jastronym","1","66","187","21 December 2018"," Strange and Nonsensical
","The current assortment of reviews tell me that this movie is almost universally liked, so I am expecting to make a lot of friends by saying that I hated this movie, in that I didn't find it made a lot of sense, had numerous plot holes, and was just plain strange.<br/><br/>By this time, there is probably not a single person in the industrialized world who knows the story of Spider-Man: radioactive spider bite, uncle dies, becomes superhero. Sure, every incarnation of Peter Parker has been a little different: Toby McGuire was an awkward bookworm, Andrew Garfield was a skateboard rat, and Tom Holland built Lego with Ned. Spider-verse features a replacement for Peter Parker: Miles Morales, who while spending his time with his delinquent uncle vandalizing abandoned stations with graffiti art, a fitting substitute for building Lego with Ned, finds himself bitten by a radioactive spider and of course you know the rest there. Why a radioactive spider was hanging out in an abandoned station was never explained.<br/><br/>After realizing what happened, Morales returns to the station to check out the spider, only to become involved in a fight alongside the original Spider-Man over a machine that opens doors to parallel universes. The original Spider-Man dies after asking Morales to help him, so Morales decides he needs to become Spider-Man's replacement, only to learn that the portal his brought into this world other spider-people from different universes: another Peter Parker, who is dumb and eats too much, Gwen Stacey as Spider-Girl, a young Asian girl from the future who has a robot, a black-and-white Spider-Man from the 1930s, and a two-dimensional animated pig. Of course, why the portal only allowed spider-people to pass and not the criminals or anyone else for that matter was never explained either, and also leads to the question on whether there are Miles Moraleses in other universes or Gwen Staceys in this one. And then, Morales has developed the mysterious power to turn invisible. Where that came from was never explained either.<br/><br/>The whole thing is bizarre, and the animation in trying to convey these interdimensional fights is so strange that it is often hard to figure out what is going on. At this point, I am trying to figure out what the public finds so appealing about this movie, and the only explanation I can come up with are the political aspects, the fact that Spider-man does not need to be a white male anymore, and when he is he doesn't need to be smart."
"sulinc","Null","12","26","16 December 2018"," Best animated movie of the year BY FAR
","First and foremost, I know everyone is talking about the animation and how the animation is great and how the animation is revolutionary and how it puts animation 10 years ahead or something. All of that is true. I can confirm all of those things. Little easter eggs are hidden in the animation, and it's so stylistic and fast. When you do a close up on a person's face, you can see little dots and circles in their face, just like in comics. I don't know whether this movie was hand-drawn, 3D CGI, or a mix of both, but whatever it was, it was breathtaking.<br/><br/>Second, the performances. Jake Johnson was so good, I will only hear him as Peter Parker. Nicholas Cage should just stick to voice acting, as he was better in this than he was in Teen Titans. I don't know how Shameik Moore sounded like a teenager, but he did. Speaking of good impressions, Mahershala Ali as Uncle Aaron sounded like a completely different person in this movie, I didn't even know he was in this movie until the credits rolled. Oscar Isaac plays a certain spoilery role, and Hailee Steinfeld is amazing as always. John Mulaney was the biggest surprise, as Spider-Ham was much more enjoyable than expected.<br/><br/>Next let's talk about the story. So original and creative, and full of twists and turns. The villains are all menacing, (especially a certain female villain, who turned up being wayyy more creepy than she had any right to be). The script is super tight, and each character uses different words, like Nicholas Cage's character, SpiderMan Noir, doesn't use any words that were made after the 1930's. Lord and Miller are probably one of my favorite duos in Hollywood right now. Their writing is so sharp and quick, and I love it.<br/><br/>Other surprises: Without spoiling, what they did to Aunt May was super unexpected, and was simply hilarious. I could never guess what the end credits scene would be, and I wouldn't want any other scene than the one we got. Speaking of scenes, the Stan Lee cameo in this movie almost made me tear up, but then he cracked a joke, which made me laugh, but made the scene even sadder.<br/><br/>This is by far the best animated movie of 2018, and possibly the best movie of the year. I can't wait for the sequel."
"sweidman-28016","9","12","26","15 December 2018"," One of My Favorites!!!
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse Review:<br/><br/>Into the Spider-Verse is a new Sony animated movie about Miles Morales, a Spider-Man, who discovers multiple versions of Spider-Man from different dimensions after an experiment gone wrong. I absolutely love Spider-Man. He is my favorite character of all time so I was super excited for this. I loved Into the Spider-Verse! Everything was definitely thought through very carefully, taking into consideration all the comics and backstories for each character. The story was amazing. It was trippy and just fantastic. It wasn't really predictable for the most part which is really good. The voice acting was really good. Shameik Moore as Miles was by far the best part. His emotion was really good and you could feel for him like you knew Miles. Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker was really good. I thought that Spider-Man was funny and just enjoyable. Mahershala Ali as Uncle Aaron was very good. Mahershala is just a really good actor and if was cool to hear him voice acting. Brian Tyree Henry player Jefferson Davis and he was a great voice actor for Miles's father. All the characters had great development. There were three Spider-Men that came later on that I really liked but didn't have too much exposition on them, but it made sense for them not to have to much. Throughout the film when we meet all the Spider-Men they do exposition on them and they do it in a comedic way and for those three they didn't need to go too deep so it worked. Also the villain of the story, King Pin, had a great design and looked like a good villain but he kind of failed a little. I could see his views after his backstory was revealed but I wanted just a little more out of him. This film had some of the best animation I've ever seen. They made it like a comic book and it looked beautiful. Also the movie is a bit trippy so some of the scenes were just beautiful looking. I could talk about this movie for a long while but I don't want to get into spoilers. If you love Marvel and Spider-Man there is no way to be disappointed. I would recommend it for sure. It'll be nominated for Best Animated Feature for the Oscars (it was nominated for the Golden Globes). It's now hard to say if this or Incredibles 2 will win. This movie has higher ratings but Incredibles 2 is Disney and they almost always win. Once again see it! I absolutely loved Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse!!!<br/><br/>My Grade: A"

","I'll be upfront, I'm giving this 1 star because of the treatment of Peter Parker.<br/><br/>They didn't do the Andrew Garfield thing and turn him into a bully.

","The Trailers to this already were pretty promising. I was a bit skeptical tho because it's still sony. Fortunately, my scepsis was proven wrong.<br/><br/>First and foremost: the animation in this film is drop dead gorgeous. The last time I saw animation this innovative, was with the lego movie in 2014. The soundtrack is surprisingly good too. The story is pretty basic, but the pacing, the action and the humor all work perfectly as a whole. Especially the student/mentor relationship between miles and old peter parker plays out exceptionally well and serves as the emotional anchor of the movie. The rest of the side characters fall pretty flat, which isn't that bad because they give more room for miles. The only one that really bugged me was Spider-Ham, who was just a bit too over the top and silly. The Villains are ok, but nothing mind-blowing. The third act disappoints a little bit because it feels a bit overblown.<br/><br/>Overall, Into the Spider-Verse is fun, action-packed family entertainment at its best, with a few minor issues here and there. Definitely watch it in the cinema if you can because of the visuals."

It seemed as if the characters as are in comic book page were moving. This thing is Very Very new Experiences
While being a fan of #MCU, the Spiderman did not take back the scary again.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10"

","In a land where every movie feels like it's trying to be Ironman, and all of the major studios are trying to play catch-up to marvel, leave it to a collaborative production between marvel and Sony to make one of the most fun and unique feeling blockbusters in recent memory<br/><br/>The story is a slightly altered but true to form adaptation of the Miles Morales origin story from the comics, prividng the same complexity and themes in his successful debut. The supporting cast perfectly intertwines the usual familiar faces with the additional characters from the alternate dimensions, leaving the pacing and focus tight and centered around Miles' arc, while also allowing every character to have meaningful moments that make their presence in the film necessary and earned.<br/><br/>Visually, this movie is stunning, and the inclusion of comic book panels and stylings makes this movie feel like it literally jumped off the page. This makes this easily the most visually distinct comic book movie ever to hit the big screen and I'm genuinely so grateful for the hard work the creators clearly dumped into every frame.<br/><br/>Stop feeling like you're getting robbed by big studios with long running franchises and go give Sony all your money for making this film, they deserve it. I can only encourage the balls that went into producing this film and it wholeheartedly paid off. The story is fantastic, the themes always relevant and the filmmaking is stunning throughout."
"MJL_Uncensored","9","10","21","18 December 2018"," The Best Spiderman Movie Ever
","Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse is Sony's latest attempt to cash in on their license to Marvel's Spider-man franchise (like Venom), is one of the best non-MCU affiliated endeavors Sony has ever produced. While Venom was a refreshing update to the character's origin story, after the disastrous outing in Spider-man 3, it still lacked the presence of his most crucial adversary-Spider-man. With the infectiously fun Tom Holland's take on the web crawler side-lined till 2019, Sony needed to keep their only superhero franchise in the public sphere. However, this time, they took the bold step of animating the Spider-man franchise with a story centered around his multiverse doppelganger-Miles Morales.<br/><br/>For those who are unfamiliar with Miles, he's an Afro-Latino character introduced in the comics world in 2011 as Marvel experimented with shedding their homogenous base and reached out to attract readers of all cultures. In Spiderman-Homecoming, he's briefly mentioned by Donald Glover's modest take on The Prowler. He even appears in Sony's newest PS4 Spider-man game, so the ground was tilled in advance of his arrival. Moreover, his appearance is nothing short of spectacular.<br/><br/>Miles is a charming teenager with loving parents who are willing to send him away to ensure he receives a world-class education and the best chance at success in a dangerous world. He is the by-product of Gen-X age parents who were reared the same way. When he discovers his powers after the all-to-familiar radioactive spider bite, he has a chance encounter with the real Spider-man and soon has his entire world torn apart (literally) when an experiment by King Pin sucks multiple versions of Spider-man, into Miles reality. These multiverse Spider-people include two female versions of the acclaimed hero, two additional male versions, and a Looney Toons inspired pig version. It sounds like a recipe for disaster narratively. Surprisingly, the story works amazingly well. Moreover, that's not the only thing that works well in this film.
Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse blends the beauty of 3-D animation with the stylized look of ink to paper art. The union creates a fascinating phantasmagoria of lucid animation that will leave you in awe of its quality for the first half of the movie. When you're done being mesmerized by that, there's still room on your plate for a heartfelt story about friendship, discovering one's purpose and the love of family - all the things you've come to expect from this franchise. There's enough heart in this movie to make you care about the stakes in this film-which are felt early on and repeated later in the movie to remind you that this isn't a rated-G film.<br/><br/>Now, it would be irresponsible to ignore Stan Lee's overriding message that the diversity of the Spiderverse (or Marvel in general) is a good thing in an era of diversity resistance. Miles parrots this, and so do all the other versions of Spider-man. Moreover, it's true. There's enough room in this world for multiple versions of this superhuman and we should all welcome updated take on the character when they're done this well.<br/><br/>This film is a dazzling display of style and story. The tongue in cheek narration finds a way to celebrate the ups and downs of the Toby McGuire & Andrew Garfield Spiderman eras. Also, it's as much of a nod to the past as it is a celebration of the future of this franchise. Now, if Sony can find a way to make its villains as intense as they were in this movie-in their live-action films-they will be able to milk the franchise for all it's worth."

","""Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse"" (2018 release; 117 min.) is the latest version of the Peter Parker /Spiderman story. After a clever opening montage with the Columbia/Sony/Marvel logos, Spiderman introduces himself to the audience: ""There is only one Spiderman, and I'm it!"". We then get to know Miles Morales, a teenager who admires Spiderman, and does not like attending school at the elite Brooklyn Visions Academy. His dad is a cop at the NYPD, and does not care much for Spiderman. One day Miles visits his freewheeling uncle, and while Miles is working on mural art, he is bitten by a spider. He wakes up the next day having grown taller overnight, and with a lower voice, and with strange powers. Could there be more than one Spiderman? At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: when a movie requires not one, not two, but three directors, it typically is a very bad sign, but in this case it turns out to be the exact opposite. Among the never-ending stream of comic book heroes live action fare, often with dubious quality (this week's Aquaman looks particularly bad), here comes a computer-animated film that has been freed from live-action shackles, and as a result is the freshest offering in the comic book superhero movies in a long time. The animation is dazzling, the characters are in-depth, the story line is complex and engaging. When I saw the movie's end credits, I saw all these big names for the voices (Nicolas Cage, Hailee Steinfeld, Lily Tomlin, Zoe Kravitz, Liev Schreiber, etc.). Truth be told, I hadn't recognized a single of them as the movie was playing. Look out for a cameo appearance from Stan Lee himself (sadly he passed away just weeks before this movie came out). Bottom line: ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider=Verse"" shows the way how, for me, comic books should get the big screen treatment. Can't wait for the sequel and apparent spin-offs (yes, plural!).<br/><br/>""Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse"" was released wide on December 14, with tremendous positive buzz and critical acclaim. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely, with lots of families and kids ""from age 7 to 77"". If you are curious whether the film is as good as people say it is, I readily suggest you check it out, be it in theaters (for maximum visual impact), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

","We all know about Peter Parker. He saved the city, fell in love and then saved the city again and again. But this is not just about him, not anymore. Miles Morales(Shameik Moore), a teenager who admires Spider-Man, struggles to adjust to his new elite boarding school and live up to the expectations of his parents. He gets bitten by a radioactive spider and becomes the one and only Spider-Man, at least in his reality. In the result of Wilson Fisk's particle accelerator, multiverse brings his counterparts from other dimensions into his reality and they have to work together to stop an immense threat.<br/><br/>The first thing, that has to be acknowledged is the unique animation style, which combines comic-book visuals and fantastic animation, it works perfectly in this movie and it is more precise than a live-action movie, even though it does take some time to get used to. The pace of the film doesn't feel rushed, it takes its' time. Character arcs and their backgrounds are well written and develop the characters well throughout the movie.<br/><br/>If you are new to this character and only know who Spider-Man is, you can still enjoy this movie and everything will be told in most dynamic and humorous way possible. It has everything a great Spider-movie should have and even music is great and feels like it belongs to the character.

Stan Lee's cameo is really emotional and overall the whole movie is great. Don't overlook it just because its animated."
"Animated_Antic","9","8","16","18 December 2018"," An amazing and mind-blowing animated movie.
","Spider-Man has gone through a lot in film, hasn't he? From the trilogy directed by Sam Raimi with Tobey Maguire, to Marc Webb's two Amazing Spider-Man films with Andrew Garfield, and being in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Tom Holland. He has really been through a lot. So if you took him as well as many different incarnations of the comic book character and put them into one movie, you'd get ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"". It may seem like a really crazy idea, but here it works. And it works phenomenally well. This is such an amazing animated movie and is also a breakthrough for new animation technologies. I haven't really seen a full length animated movie like this until now and it really is mind-blowing. This seriously is such an amazing movie.<br/><br/>Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) is a teenager living in Brooklyn who is having a complicated life. He has been accepted into a new school despite not really wanting to go and is having a sort of difficult relationship with his parents (Luna Lauren Velez and Brian Tyree Henry). He does though bond closely to his uncle Aaron (Mahershala Ali) over his passion for graffiti. One night though, Miles is bitten by a radioactive spider and then starts to develop very strange powers. It doesn't stop there though. After seeing that Kingpin (Leiv Schreiber) has built a Super Collider in hopes to reconnect with his now deceased family, he then suddenly realizes that the portal has opened up other Spider-Men into his universe including Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson), Spider-Woman (Hailee Steinfeld), Spider-Man Noir (Nicholas Cage), Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn), and even an actual Spider Pig named Spider-Ham (John Mulaney). Together they must stop the Kingpin's plans of possibly destroying the world with his Super Collider and to get the other Spider-Men home before they glitch and eventually die. I would say more that happens, but I'd rather not spoil because you just need to see the film for yourself.<br/><br/>Last year, I remember Sony Pictures Animation making their worst film to date with ""The Emoji Movie"". That film was boring, unoriginal, unfunny, painful to sit through, and clearly a product of corporate executive meddling. A year later, they have made their best film to date as it was captivating, funny, and a really thrill ride. For an animated comeback, this really is one of the best I've seen in years. It's clear the company is heading forward as a filmmaker driven studio which allows for more creator influences and ideas and less executive interferences and I'm very happy to see that. The story's main focus being on Miles getting the hang of his powers as well as the responsibility of taking on the role as Spider-Man is the highlight of the film. Seeing him growing as a character and getting through difficulties including struggling at this new school, trying to bond with his parents, and learning from the other Spider-Men characters is what makes the movie fantastic. It's what I expected to see from a superhero movie and I think it really delivered. As for the animation, it's incredible. This is probably the closest movie I've seen that looks like a comic book and it blends traditional animation and computer animation together really well. I've seen the technique dabbled with by Disney in shorts like ""Paperman"" and ""Feast"", but never have I seen a full length feature animated movie take on this style until now. Having seen it though, I can easily say I want more. This really is a game changer. The characters in this movie were the real highlight though. Although the character growth of Miles is the highlight of the movie, the other Spider-Men characters are all hilarious and stand out. Peter B. Parker and Spider-Woman are great teachers in a way to help Miles becoming who he is and Spider-Man Noir and Spider-Ham led to some of the funniest moments in the entire movie. I'm so glad they weren't in the trailers and I dare not say them here because they're so funny. This really was a fantastic animated movie, but I can say it's not flawless. For one, the dubstep like soundtrack did grate on me a bit and kind of got on my nerves. I prefer a full orchestra over dubstep any day. Also, I thought Kingpin could've been just a little bit better as a villain. I understood his motives and thought Schreiber did a fantastic job playing him, but I don't think he was quite as intimating and evil as I wanted him to be. He did come across as threatening, but he could've been just a tad bit more for me to legitimately fear. Still though, that's really it.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is seriously a phenomenal animated movie with a great superhero story, fantastic and groundbreaking animation, and funny memorable characters to really hold it up. This really is such an achievement for Sony Pictures Animation and I'm so happy to see that they can really make a fantastic animated movie. I hope to see some more awesome movies like this in the future because this really did blow my mind."

Not entirely sure why the main kid has the powers he does because it seems to have nothing to do with a spider but a robotic spider??
Nevertheless it was cool and the story was fun.
HOWEVER its clear the film was animated for 3D but when I watched it in my 2 d theater the normally blurred images in the background (the way we humans see things) were occasionally double images, the likes of which you see in a 3d movie when you watch for a second without the glasses.

"pehsuoon","6","42","118","13 December 2018"," Good entertainment but not as per Hype
","There are many highly positive reviews on this movie promoting it so I went in expecting something spectacular but after watching this movie I consider it over-hyped.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, its a good movie and fun movie to watch, just over-hyped. What's refreshing about this movie is the artistic animation style which differs from traditional animation and the introduction to the new Miles Morales story line which also brings with it new supporting characters as well.<br/><br/>The animation is creative, artistic and entertaining to watch, but the story line and character development in itself is still not as good as Pixar/Disney characters. It tries very hard to make up for it using animation FX and great action sequences, but I could not really emotionally relate to the characters like I could for Pixar/Disney. Having said this, thank goodness the most likable character is the main character of Miles Morales. The villains in this movie is not as well fleshed out as say in other live action TV series/movies where they are also featured especially the main villain whom is better featured in a currently running TV series.<br/><br/>Overall-good entertainment."

"Dorkboss","10","10","22","19 December 2018"," My favorite Spider-Man movie of all time
","Out of every Spider-Man movie I've seen, this movie is the most satisfying Spider-Man film I've ever watched. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse not only tells the story about Miles Morales becoming Spider-Man, but a machine that has the ability to open the multiverse that holds many Spider-People such as Spider-Gwen, Noir Spider-Man, Spider-Pig, etc.<br/><br/>While the story is both great and fun, the film also has heart added to the film which is great because you really get attach to the character especially Miles who I really feel for throughout the movie. The animation is really like a comic book is coming to life, not only does the animation helps the action sequence looks so awesome, but each Spider-Character has their own animation style that looks good.<br/><br/>With Sony co-owning the Spider-Man rights, along with the MCU, I can see the possibility of this movie having a sequel, they don't need to retell the same story of Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man many times, they can open up the world that is full of Spider-People such as Spider-Man 2099, Scarlet Spider-Man, Cosmic Spider-Man, Spider Carnage, and more."
"CubsandCulture","10","10","22","16 December 2018"," Joseph Campbell Meets Bansky Meets Spider-Man
","This is among the best films of the year and I really don't know what is the best part of it. The screenplay deftly interweaves a compelling origin story for a hero while deconstructing the notion of the monomyth while grappling with the cultural weight of Spider-Man. The screenplay is sharp, funny and emotionally resonant. Miles is a great character. Not a mere clone of Peter Parker but a person in his own right with unique foibles and desires. The screenplay does a lot to demonstrate the particulars of representation lead to different tonalities. It manages to make a really obvious twist hidden in the process of doing that as well. The story is great.<br/><br/>But it is also realized in some of the most vivid, alive animation I have ever seen. The film's CGI is expressive in ways that CGI rarely is. The directors lean into the stylistic implications of the story, each of the Spider-people have a different look for example. But they manage to make the film feel whole and unitary. Best of all the mainstay of the animation feels like the bright marvel style of the 60's mixed with the vibrant world of street art. (Miles does graffiti). Comic panels, lettering, action sound text etc all make appearances. It was a massive risk that pays off. The visual scope of this film is amazing; it is simply incredible how alive this film feels despite the stylistic artifice.<br/><br/>This is a film that truly works in every regard."

","This movie has everything you could ever ask for in a Spider-Man movie. Tons of comic book references, a VERY good storyline with happy, sad, and thrilling moments; it has dozens of funny jokes, and a beautiful and unique animation style. The character development is also great. You don't feel like it's just a mash of random Spider-men. You learn to love and appreciate all of them. This was not a rushed movie. It clearly took much time and thought into producing it. Best Spider-man movie hands down. I saw it twice already and I might just go see it a third time!"
"jwwalrath-227-85487","10","10","22","16 December 2018"," Wow!
","I have a new favorite Spider-Man film!<br/><br/>Into the Spider-Verse looks amazing. I've seen combinations of two- and three-dimensional animation before, but not anything like this. The movie is very colorful and makes excellent use of action. The whole thing is supposed to look like a comic book and has some wildly creative ideas, including color slightly popping off the lines and thought captions and bubbles. This movie takes place in an alternate reality from more traditional Spider-Man timelines, giving the creators liberty to come up with some inventive visual twists on classic Spider-Man villains without feeling like real betrayals to the characters.<br/><br/>Now, the movie does have a couple things that I adjusted to but may bug people with more sensitive eyes. As mentioned, the color is off-line and the background in particular can be blurry-looking. The motion frame rate is a little jerky, which I assume is a stylistic choice.<br/><br/>The plot is equally impressive. The film features Spider-Men from multiple dimensions and multiple other characters yet manages balance and develop them all almost seamlessly. (Wouldn't have minded a little more time on Mile's relationship with his uncle, but that's a minor issue.) The comedy and drama is equally good. The movie has fun, but there are also stakes. There is real loss in this. (Parents who are more selective in what their children watch, may consider this more of a ""big boy"" film).<br/><br/>The movie stars Spider-Man Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore), who started off in Marvel's Ultimate comic line. He became popular enough that when the Ultimate universe was shut down, because Ultimate Spider-Man was the only real big seller, he was transferred to the main Marvel line. Hardcore Peter Parker fans may be upset that he isn't the star, but they did such a great job with Miles' character that I don't think you'll mind. He is likable and has personal issues like Peter, but in his own unique way. He forms a mentor relationship with a down-on-his-luck and world-weary Peter Parker (New GIrl's Jake Johnson), and the two of them have great chemistry and basically make the movie.<br/><br/>This is one of those truly innovative steps in moviemaking and a sincere homage to comic books."

","Alright, I'll say it, we are oversaturated with bad and tired animation nowadays. However, Spiderman breaks the mold in every way, being one of the most beautiful and innovative pieces of animation that has ever been created. It is in the top 5 pieces of animation ever created in my opinion. It's relatable, and shows us that it doesn't matter what we look like or where we come from, anyone can wear the mask. Not to mention, it is the ONLY comic book movie that has been created to date in my opinion. The dotted and comicbook-driven aesthetic is unbelievable, and captures your attention every moment of the film. An absolutely wonderful movie that has deserved every award it has already won, and every award it is up for in the future."

"gxgabz","9","5","9","3 January 2019"," A love letter for the legend, Stan Lee and to fans of Spider-Man as a whole.
","Best animated superhero movie out there. It almost makes me want to trust Sony again... almost, since the Emoji Movie, Ghostbusters '16 and the other endless trash they've put out recently like those horrid Adam Sandler junk are still out there and it severely dampens my view on them.<br/><br/>BUT if they still want to make another Spider-Man-esque film franchise again that doesn't feel like a forced, half-assed, desperate cash grab *cough* TASM *cough* Venom, then this is a really solid start and I would love to see more of it, as long as it's good of course. Like seriously, this film is what a Spider-Man movie should be AND more! it just oozes with uniqueness, mainly due to the animation style and its colorful band of characters.<br/><br/>The only flaws I had with this film was the slight misuse of the soundtrack since there were a scene or two where it didn't fit in with the moment shown. The story was also quite clichéd for the most part, but there are some decent twists here and there. Overall I don't think the flaws I listed out won't bother the average movie-goer that much and this film is still a blast even if you don't have much prior knowledge about Spider-Man in the comics or films, though they would help in understanding the plethora of Spider-references this movie has.<br/><br/>Props to the crew and cast who worked on this fantastic film, they truly deserve the praise. 2018 truly was the best year for us Spider-Man fans in a long time. Stan Lee would be at peace knowing his greatest creation has flourished from the humble beginnings on paper, to the grandiose state of stardom in the fictional world and pop culture."

"Kirollos-Noah","10","5","9","27 December 2018"," The best movie of the whole year!
","Was that very hard to make a very decent Spider-man movie, Sony?<br/><br/>Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse is directed by Peter Ramsey, Robert Persichetti Jr. and Rodney Rothman, screenplay by Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman, and voices-starring by Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld and Mahershala Ali.<br/><br/>Story by Phil Lord, and it's about Brooklyn teen Miles Morales, and the limitless possibilities of the Spider-Verse, where more than one can wear the mask.<br/><br/>First time I heard about this movie I wasn't that hype about the idea of the movie or the animation. The trailer wasn't so clear about its animation, or the very bold storyline! When I went to see this movie I was blown away by the striking animation and the bold storytelling.. I think it's a very risky step for Sony to take, to make a very unique, new and comic-alike animation, I mean what if the audience didn't like it? It could have been a big disappointing movie, because it has an amazing story, I think this story is definitely the best story of the whole Spiderman movies, also the animation is amazing, it's flawless!
When an animation movie brings the live-action movies down, it means that it's definitely unique and bold!!<br/><br/>The story didn't take so long to get you into the main plot, it went with its surprising ""scene"" -I'm not gonna spoil anything in this review- and though it made a very good introduction of the characters, so the first act was very good, shocking and humorous too!<br/><br/>The second act still a very funny and thrilling as the first act, introducing the rest of the characters, so it took more time to get us back to the main plot, and I loved it, because some characters wasn't that clear in the first act that I wanted to know more about, and others that I wanted more of their backstories because I liked them! After introducing the ""rest of the characters"" we get another shocking scene, driving us to another shocking scene.. excuse me if I'm mysterious about some stuff, but I don't want to spoil anything, and still, if you watched the movie, you're gonna understand me very well.<br/><br/>The third act was very predictable though, but still very thrilling because of its amazing animation combined with the amazing action, and emotions... Oh yeah, the third act is completely emotional, and action-full!<br/><br/>There're not any subplots like Fantastic Beasts the Crimes of Grindelwald or something, it's very straight and clear.. very good for kids, and amazing for Spider-man fans and adults as well.<br/><br/>I think that Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse is the Spider-Man that we deserve as fans of Spider-Man and it's definitely the best Spider-Man movie of all the time.! And of course, Spider-Man Into the Spider-verse gets an A+!<br/><br/>Alright, guys.. thank you as always for reading and supporting my work, and if you liked this you can click on my name above and read all of my reviews, lots of movie-reviews are coming ahead.. thanks again!"
"JJ-Jet","10","5","9","27 December 2018"," The BEST superhero film
","First off, this is the most visually unique film I've seen in a long while. It's stunning. The storyline was intriguing, and creative without being hard to understand. I took my two sons 8 and younger and the could both easily follow what was going on. This movie is a complete blast from start to finish. It has clever humor, great message, and incredible action (which was unexpected from a cartoon). This is a must see! They nailed it!!"
"BandSAboutMovies","10","5","9","26 December 2018"," The best comic book movie I've ever seen
","The thing I hate about superhero movies is the origin story. After a multitude of Spider-Man stories, do we really need another retelling of his origin? That's the first - of many - things that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse does right. Much like how Grant Morrison retold Superman's beginnings in one page in All-Star Superman, this movie tells you everything you need to know within one minute and goes right into the action. It expects you to know the expected, but then once it makes you feel comfortable, it tears the rug out from under you.<br/><br/>Here's the low down for those of you that don't read comics: there's more than one reality and more than one version of Spider-Man, who may not always be a man. Written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who left Solo due to creative differences, this movie is pure joy from start to finish. If you know and love the characters, it's so amazing to see them treated properly on the big screen. And if you don't, it's so much fun to meet all new versions of a character you already love.<br/><br/>Beyond the Spidey you know and love, there's Miles Morales, a gifted teen who struggles to fit into a new school. He loves Spider-Man, is often at odds with his parents and looks up to his uncle Aaron. While working on graffiti, he's bit by a radioactive spider and suddenly has the same abilities as his hero.<br/><br/>After a tragic incident when the real Spidey battles the Kingpin as that baddy tries to uses a particle accelerator to bring back his lost wife and son, Miles must take on the mantle of a hero while working alongside the Spiders of other dimensions: Spider-Gwen, Spider-Man Noir, Peter Porker the Spectacular Spider-Ham, and Peni Parker and SP//dr.<br/><br/>The voice talent in this movie is absolutely amazing: Lily Tomlin is the best Aunt May ever, Nicholas Cage steals the show as Spider-Man Noir, who is from a world where it's always black and white and smells like rain and it was great to hear comedian John Mulaney as Spider-Ham.<br/><br/>There's so much of this movie that perfectly translates the language of comics in a way that few films have succeeded in accomplishing. Ang Lee's The Hulk came close, but the animated styles of this film are constantly moving and even more alive than real action.<br/><br/>It's also the first time I've seen a teenage world in a superhero movie that feels vibrant and now. Nothing feels fake, phony or forced about the school scenes. And the music is just as powerful as the film.<br/><br/>Of all the Stan Lee cameos in the Marvel films, the one here feels the most organic and perfect. It brought a tear to my eye when he sold Miles the costume and told him that all the costumes eventually fit. Kudos to the producers for remembering both Lee and Steve Ditko at the film's end.<br/><br/>In case you didn't pick it up, I give this movie my highest recommendation. While Infinity War may be the best Marvel movie ever, you need to have seen every single Marvel movie ever to get that. This is the kind of film that Becca could watch and enjoy without needing to open a single comic, which is just how she likes it. It's not only the best animated movie I've seen this year, it may be the best movie overall."

"bozzod","1","87","274","17 December 2018"," Real Review from Spiderfan
","So the 1 rating is to offset all of the fake ""10"" greatest movie ever reviews. This is truly a 6/7. The movie is aimed squarely at the tween/teen audience with a grating urban contemporary soundtrack. This has little to no connection to the actual Spider-Verse series. The story they came up with was acceptable. I liked the interaction between Miles his father and uncle. Not all of the humor hits. They chose some of the lamest spiders from the Spider-Verse. Especially bad was the manga spider and Spiderham is less cartoony in the comics. Did not like the Kingpin voice or portrayal and every other villain such as Tombstone is just wasted. The movie had heart which elevates it over common kiddie animation. Not even close to the best Spider-Man movie."

The soundtrack/ music fits perfectly into the movie and just makes it moore cooler!

"cinemawithcj","10","38","110","6 December 2018"," Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse - Cinema with CJ Review
","Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse makes you aware pretty early on you're in for something special. The curious project long in development unsure of where it sits in Spider-Man canon makes it known that it is the Spider-Man canon.<br/><br/>It's a love letter to every single piece of Spider-Man you know and love and even the stuff you might not. The movies, the cartoons, the comics, the character, the icon. If you want a definitive Spider-Man, I think you're looking at it.<br/><br/>Into The Spider-Verse oozes so much style from it you can't help but be sucked into its universe. The animation is slick and gorgeous and perfectly on form here, translating Spider-Man to the big screen like you've never seen before. It's beautiful and it's technically impressive, playing with all sorts of styles (helped by the diverse supporting characters) but never losing sight of its spirit.<br/><br/>There's never been a more true comic adaptation. Watchmen is so far back in the mind alongside every other comic book movie here, Spider-Verse uses so many techniques in it you just feel everything you expect Spider-Man to actually be. It's like if Deadpool had those yellow boxes, or if Fantastic Four had a good movie.<br/><br/>You feel so much love for Spider-Man in the making of this film, full of everything for the hardcore fan to the most casual movie-goer. Whatever your working knowledge of Spider-Man, you're going to be impressed.<br/><br/>The actual story and characters haven't even been touched in this review so far and that's because Into The Spider-Verse gets the groundwork just so right of course everything falls into place. It subverts expectations, it gives you the exact payoffs you want, it has such smart humour and touching emotion. It's everything great about every Spider-Man piece of fiction and almost none of the flaws.<br/><br/>Into The Spider-Verse surpasses even the likes of Spider-Man 2 here. It's not hammy (beyond Spider-Ham), it's not cheesy, it's not full of bad CG, it's not got soap-Opera antics that don't land, it's not set outside New York, it's none of those things.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is reinvented alongside all the references of his reinvention. It gives us an origin story that doesn't suck, because it knows you know all of that. Several times over. It knows how smart the audience is. It knows we know the stories. The beats. So instead it gives us a show. It gives everything slightly different to what you know and expect, but leaves you happy with how familiar things are.<br/><br/>The entire cast and crew have truly made something special. The writing, the directing, the animating, the acting, the soundtrack, everything. It shows the work that has gone into it. It stands apart from most of the other animated movies of recent years. It makes yet another good case for animation needing more of that mainstream blockbuster highlight. This is better than pretty much most of the superhero movies that have been made to date.<br/><br/>Life has been breathed into Spider-Man yet again. And it's not necessarily gone bigger and better. It's human. It's funny. It's down to earth. It takes us on the journey Miles Morales is being taken on. Things get weird. Things get fun. An all star voice cast's praises can't be sung more. None of the people involved can't be celebrated more.<br/><br/>There's great power given when you get the reins of Spider-Man. And with it comes great responsibility. Or however the saying goes. I'm just glad that I'm in the Spider-Verse were it all goes perfectly with this movie."
"nancyldraper","5","44","130","15 December 2018"," Disappointing
","Disappointing. I was looking forward to this movie for two reasons: a great voice cast and the whimsy of multiple Spider Man/characters from varying dimensions. But instead of building interesting characters (heroes and villians) I was presented with a number of long, chaotic action sequences robbed of dramatic (or comedic) tension by the lack of well articulated characters and interpersonal dynamics. There was also a production anomaly that was puzzling - there were times when the animation was blurry as if drawn for 3D (there was a 3D version, but that wasn't the one I was viewing), so, I hastily put on my 3D glasses, which I happened to have at hand, and it was still 2D, just blurry ... odd(?). I hoped for a better story and entertaining character interactions but I was disappointed. I give this film a 5 (meh) out of 10. {Marvel Animation}"
"grimlock-96314","9","8","17","17 December 2018"," Great movie all around except for my headache

"shawneofthedead","9","21","56","13 December 2018"," Into The Spider Verse isn't just the best Spider-Man movie that nobody asked for - it's one of the best Spider-Man movies ever made, period.
","THE LOW-DOWN: Does the world really need another Spider-Man movie? In just over 15 years, we've already had three different Peter Parkers, each one with the same basic origin story. It's a reliable formula that's been run into the ground... hasn't it? And yet, Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse will have you clamouring for more. This fresh, funny, fantastic film proves that there's entire universes of mileage left in all things Spider-Man - introducing us to brand-new hero Miles Morales, while also dissecting (and reinforcing) our love for good ol' Peter Parker.<br/><br/>THE STORY: Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) is a high-school kid just trying to figure out his purpose in life - which sharpens somewhat terrifyingly into focus when he's bitten by a radioactive spider and finds himself literally climbing the walls. Suddenly, he's forced to assume the mantle of Spider-Man, battling to save the world from the heartbroken insanity of Wilson Fisk (Liev Schreiber). It's a tall order for a half African-American, half Puerto-Rican kid from Brooklyn but, fortunately, Miles soon discovers that he isn't alone in the universe...<br/><br/>THE GOOD: Where to even begin? Into The Spider Verse is a delight in practically every way. First and foremost, it's remarkably refreshing to see a character like Miles - a young man of mixed-race descent - get his own superhero origin story. It helps enormously that the screenplay, credited to Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman, is equal parts sweet, sharp and snarky. Some superhero movies (*cough*DC*cough*) can take themselves too seriously, but Into The Spider Verse skewers Spider-Man's cinematic history with a cheeky charm that's impossible to resist. Miles also leads a cast of enormously appealing characters, including clever twists on fan favourites like Peter Parker (Jake Johnson), Aunt May (Lily Tomlin), Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) and Doctor Octopus (REDACTED).<br/><br/>THE NOT-SO-GOOD: There's almost too much going on, all the time. Into The Spider Verse is stuffed to the brim with multiple characters, multiple universes and multiple plot-lines - so much so that the emotional weight of Miles' fraught relationships with his dad (Brian Tyree Henry) and uncle (Mahershala Ali), which should tear audiences apart, comes close to getting lost amongst the shift and shuffle of the plot. It's hardly a deal-breaker, though: the narrative beats are all there, ready to be savoured and rediscovered on a rewatch.<br/><br/>THE GLORIOUSLY GEEKY: Comic-book fans, rejoice - this one's for you. There's a soul-deep love for Spider-Man lore threaded through every gorgeous frame of this movie. Naturally, it's right there in the plot, as alternate universes collide and truly cult characters tumble into Miles' life. But it's the medium of animation that makes the real difference here. It's why Into The Spider Verse can embrace its comic-book roots in a way that live-action movies can't. In some of the film's most visually arresting sequences, Miles leaps and soars in and out of frame, trailing sound effects and narration in his wake. This living, breathing comic-book effect is the crowning achievement of Sony's animation arm - not only is it fluid and stunning, it's ridiculously inventive, mixing and matching animation styles to further plot and develop character.<br/><br/>WATCH OUT FOR: Easter eggs galore! Spider-Man and Marvel aficonados should keep their eyes peeled for references peppered throughout the film. The late Stan Lee's cameo will break and warm your heart in equal measure. Meanwhile, Brian Michael Bendis and Sara Pichelli, who co-created Miles Morales, are name-checked, as are concepts and terms well-known to fans of the comics (Earth-616 and all). Stay through the credits for a series of of wonderful, silly rewards, including a song off Spider-Man's novelty Christmas album and some intriguing scenes that hint at where this new animated franchise might go. (A sequel and spin-offs have already been greenlit! ðŸ™Œ) ALSO, this film features possibly the best use of Nicolas Cage in a movie since National Treasure!*<br/><br/>RECOMMENDED? YES. Into The Spider Verse isn't just the best Spider-Man movie that nobody asked for - it's one of the best Spider-Man movies ever made, period. It's also a top contender for best animated film of the year.<br/><br/>*Okay, fine, having Cage voice Superman in this year's Teen Titans Go! To The Movies was genius too - a nod to his life-long goal to play Superman. Maybe Cage should stick to voiceover work... ðŸ¤”"

I expected the usual standard Superhero CGI Animated movie, but looking at the credits now and noticing people behind The Lego Movie wrote and produced it, it all started to make sense.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse could very well be the best Spider-Man movie ever! The animation was very stylish with mix of CGI and Comic-Book style art.

Amazing animation,voice acting it top grade,action pieces are full of color and energy and for a comic book movie,I think this is one of the greatest.To be honest,for me at least,this is the best comic book movie since 2008.It was heart breaking,fun,crazy and one hell of a fun time.
9/10
Would love to see more!"

"pucciarello","10","9","20","16 December 2018"," My new favorite Spider-Man movie
","The pageantry, the costumes, WOW... what a movie! To start things off, I'd like to say that I'm not the biggest fan of the past Spider-Man movies except for a couple of the originals. So coming into this movie I was not planning on liking it as much as I did, although I was hopeful after hearing about the great reviews it received. To keep this review simple I will not go into much detail in why I think it was so great but rather just state my overall opinions. There were hilarious moments, countless action scenes, a perfect amount of character development, and a phenomenal soundtrack to match today's modern culture. Also, the animation was so different than the standard and it really made you feel like you were watching an animated comic book. I definitely recommend you go see this movie as it's entertaining for people of all ages and will leave you wanting to watch more."

","Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse
Non-spoiler review
Easily the best Spider-Man movie made to date. That's isn't much of a stretch, because the others, while some have been good, are just not great. Why is this the best? Simply stated, it is 100% faithful the the source material-the Marvel Comics.
While the mainstream Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is fantastic, those movies have been adapted for mainstream audiences and morphed into their own laws of their established sense of reality. This movie about the Spiderverse is straight off the colorful pages of the comics. The one true Peter Parker Spider-man, from Earth 616, does not appear in the movie. Instead, the main character is the Miles Morales Spider-Man from Marvel's Ultimate Universe, an alternate dimension that exists as part of the greater Marvel Comics universe. The 616 Spider-Man was created by the late GREATS Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, who both passed away this year. Miles was created by the man who had written the majority of all Marvel comics over the past 20 years, Brian Michael Bendis. For someone who has read comics for most of his life, I am happy to report this is the first theatrically-released superhero movie that is a faithful adaptation of the comics. Thank you Mr. Lee, Mr. Ditko, and Mr. Bendis for creating this AMAZING universe and thank you Columbia Pictures for visualizing THEIR original creations on the big screen. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Excelsior!

"vibespidersstudios","10","6","12","18 December 2018"," Everything is great and I want more of this
","I just watch this a few days ago and I wanted to think about how this movie is so good for new and old fans to the spider-man media. The animation, the story, and characters are great. I can't say enough to watch it.<br/><br/>Sony also put a lot of spoiler contain in their trailers but two side villain characters that were not in the trailers I made me surprised was Doc Ock as a female character and Prowler who was revealed to be Miles' uncle who was working with Kingpin and lastly Gwen Stacy's universe and her relationship with the Lizard.<br/><br/>So first off with Doc Ock being called as ""olivia octavius"" or ""Liv"" has a more sinister personality and look than we known and loved throughout the years as a villain for spider-man and a very good change of paste for the film with a lot of characters to balance out. When she appeared in the movie for the first time I thought she was a character that appears only once and doesn't do anything for the plot. However that all changed when she was examining Peter Parker in his late 30's from another dimension. It seems to me that this version of Doc Ock sort of did dated her blond Peter Parker in his late 20's. Anyways she is a great character in the film and I hope she comes more of a full villain in the second movie.<br/><br/>Prowler, I did not expect that twist to happen in a children film to be Miles' uncle that he looked up to his years. That moment when he refuses to kill his nephew on top of Aunt May's house. Then the Kingpin shot Mile's uncle in the back and he told Miles the he failed him as family member, it makes me even sad that Miles' father sees his dead body in the alley and broke down because even though he doesn't make as much money as him. He is still is his brother.<br/><br/>Lastly in Gwen Stacy's universe. She became spider-woman instead of Peter. Just like in the comics, Peter has been too much to the point where he turned into the lizard instead of Curt Conners and she had to kill him. Even though she lied to Miles to wants to help out and get back to her own universe by saying, ""friend."" However that is not the case, either Gwen didn't stop the bullying from happen or didn't noticed. In her expressions throughout the film it is implied that they loved each other and dated before the event when Peter became the lizard in her universe.<br/><br/>There are few things in this movie that sort of hard for viewers to get through is the movie is slow in the beginning because you are look at Miles' story and also jump scares. There is a jump scare when Miles sees the radioactive spider on the ground and it glitched making a loud in the theater. I heard kids screaming and it made me jumped out of my seat.<br/><br/>Anyways, it is recommended to say through the end of this film because Miguel from Spider-man 2099 universe comes in the post credit scene as he talks to his AI as he goes into another dimension and he went into the pointing spider-man meme."
"fwright-02681","10","6","12","18 December 2018"," Surprisingly, the best Spider-Man movie made
","I was skeptical of this movie after watching the trailers, but the overwhelming positive reviews convinced me to check it out anyway. I'm glad I did, as this movie is basically perfect for a Spider-Man fan. The animation is stylistic and cool, the music and voice acting is great, and the story manages to be somehow coherent while juggling all of the craziness. There's lots of content throughout the movie for fans of the comics, but one can go into it with no knowledge of any of it and still have a good time.<br/><br/>In all, I highly recommend seeing this amazing movie. It is absolutely spectacular."

But here's the things i can tell you about.<br/><br/>Great visual even though I kinda got a little bit dizzy sometimes because the color and the speed of this movie but for me who doesn't know much about animation technical stuff, i still can tell this movie was dope.<br/><br/>I love the story. The culture that this movie bring, the little twist that they give, the emotion. It's been a while since we got a movie like this with strong story. The music was good. It's genius, this movie have a lot of little details that make it great."

"hobgoblinlol","5","4","7","2 May 2019"," Did we all watch the same film here???
","Didn't really care for the film when it was first announced mostly because of the odd looking animation and the character Miles Morales, who I'm not a fan of, in this case screamed ""Look! black Spider-Man gets his own movie now!"" all over. But after the overwhelming praise this film got, it's every detail from animation to story-telling receiving colossal praise, I had to see it.<br/><br/>With all the hype, I thought I was gonna watch a masterpiece that would blow me away and boy, was I wrong. The only thing I enjoyed about this film were some dialogues from classic Spider-Man and noir, Miles felt extremely generic, another story of how someone who isn't talented or capable at first BUT gets better because he ""believes in himself."" of course. The villains in this are just so bad. We have one villain for a simple emotional twist, throw away villains like the FEMALE Doc Ock, Tombstone and Scorpion. And Kingpin another attempt with the overused ""sympathetic villain"" trope who's design is absolutely horrendous, it literally looks like his head is attached to his chest, they could have at least given him his classic white suit which they of course didn't. The plot is extremely generic and predictable, it has some decent moments but overall nothing memorable. Don't get me started on the god awful soundtrack.<br/><br/>My main problem with this film is the PC, SJW, diversity angle. It's just extremely conspicuous how there's such a HUGE amount of colored people even at a prestigious school that according to liberals are filled with the white privileged elite, it's just so ironic at this point. Even the villains. Either my standards are too high or everyone else's have lowered drastically. I love being proven wrong, I had low expectations when seeing Logan and John Wick 2 and I ended up loving those films. Either this movie is for a certain demographic of specific age or I'm one of the few insane people that think it's extremely overrated. Spider-Man 3 was at least entertaining, this is above everything is just boring."

This movie knew when to be humourous and when to be emotional, which is quite refreshing with all the meta and overly pushy jokes in the industry nowadays.

The comic style animation works great with this film and it was quite a risky move but it paid off. Everything in this film was polished to it's best. The jokes are just hilarious not one time did I not laugh with them when they wanted me to, I think I speak for everyone in the screening. One negative was that some moments really shouldn't of had rap music over them as it just killed the mood. At moments this film really touched me on a personal level and I'm just so confused about how this film does everything amazingly. I don't care if you like Spider-Man or not you NEED to see this film."
"danielrubio1234","9","4","7","3 January 2019"," This movie had no right to be THIS good, this movie DOES compete for the title of best Spider-Man movie to date
","I'm usually against hyperbolic reviews and reactions to movies but this movie seriously deserves the accolades it has been getting lately. First off let me get something straight... You are not in the wrong room, nor did the theater forget to give you 3D glasses if you are watching this movie in 2D. The movie goes for a stylistic choice in which they color backgrounds like how old comics misprinted colors on paper (they go ""outside the line""), the animation isn't ""choppy"", characters are animated at times in 12 fps while some backgrounds seem to be 24 fps. This all sound weird huh? I did feel weird at first until I realized it is a stylistic choice. Now that we get that clear... the movie is VISUALLY STUNNING.<br/><br/>This is the first movie I can really say that seems like a comic brought to another medium without losing anything. A perfect translation of what a comic can be in movie form. No video game, no Pixar movie, no Dreamworks movie no other piece of entertainment has the same style this movie has and that's a giant plus. I did rewatch the movie in 3D and I have to say it's one of the finest movie experiences I've had in years. When was the last time you came out of the theater feeling like you watched something absolutely *fresh*? I was not expecting this from a Comic Book Movie, I was not expecting this from YET ANOTHER Spider-Man movie but here I am, leaving a review for a film I enjoyed so much that I watched twice. I can see the style of this movie being replicated for years to come. As far as storyline goes the story is good and packs punches where you might not necessarily expect them. If you're a comic book fan of old or a Spider-Man fan you owe it to yourself to watch this movie as it is literally filled with fan-service throughout. If you're a fan of the cinema medium and you want something stylistically fresh then you ALSO owe it to yourself to watch this movie.<br/><br/>This really is an excellent movie for both young audiences and adults of any age, more than a coming of age movie this is a visual spectacle and a feat in itself to achieve what I consider the most fresh movie to come out of this whole ocean of comic book phenomenon. There are 2 after-credit scenes, not going to spoil them. Have I talked about the soundtrack yet? You can listen to it on Youtube or Spotify, it is a testament to how true to character and risky this movie went for. I was not expecting SONY of all studios to actually make a movie of this quality and simultaneously set-up the possibility of other movies in this style (not necessarily Spider-Man). Have I mentioned the people involved in this movie yet? Great people all around who have been involved in some of the most unique movies in the last few years.<br/><br/>Seriously, give the movie a shot. I picked this movie as an accident because I arrived too late for another one and ended up loving this movie immensely. This movie DOES compete for the title of best Spider-Man movie to date."
"phild24","9","4","7","2 January 2019"," A new era for superhero animation.
","A staggering achievement in superhero animation. Revalling Disney/Pixar for heart, charm and humour, this also takes a bold New direction in its style. The art and the music are seamlessly integrated to create Black Panther levels of effortless cool. As many characters as any X-Men or Avengers movie are all given plenty to do too. Can't wait for the sequel."
"paunalinconstantin","10","4","7","2 January 2019"," One of the best movie in the Spider-Man series
","From my point of view this is the one best movie in the Spider-Man series of movies, maybe on par if not better than the 2002 Sam Raimi Spider-Man.
The story line has a lot of comic book references, the characters develop true emotions, the CGI shows a lot of respect for the comic books etc etc. Such a great movie!"
"nate-car","10","4","7","2 January 2019"," I'd gladly pay to see another Spider-verse with Miles Morales...
","Some pretty dark elements for a PG movie, but overall a thoroughly exciting and enthralling Spider-Man movie that managed to be completely new and original while combining most elements of the first 5 films and several from comics and other media too.
Prowler is a real show stealer (which comic fans would never have predicted of this C-list villain) whenever he and his effects and music came on, the entire cinema held their breath and Miles Morales got such a strong showing in this, I'd gladly pay to see another Spider-verse starring him on the big screen!
All the villains were REALLY well designed (Dr. Ock is AMAZING...) Kingpin is finally done right! The first outing for Spider-Gwen was sweet and fun too.
Cartoony/corny Spider-Ham, Nick Cage (too famous a voice) and VERY graphic bloody murder were the only low points in an otherwise perfect film in almost every way!"
"samferry","10","4","7","2 January 2019"," The best movie I have seen this year
","In the year of Infinity War, Black Panther, and Incredibles 2, the SEVENTH Spider-Man movie in the last sixteen years somehow ended up being the most creative, stylistic, and comedic one of the bunch. I really cannot overstate how good this movie is. The animation is utterly astounding, the characters and dialogue are very well written, and the story is fresh and unique. There is a special quality to the energy that this film gives off through its cinematography, framing, and overall visual style that has to be seen to be fully understood. There is truly nothing like Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, and I am happy to give it the highest score possible. (Side note: this was made by Sony Pictures Animation, a very hit-or miss studio, which made it even more pleasing how enjoyable the movie truly was.)"

"CANpatbuck3664","9","4","7","23 December 2018"," A Darkhorse Candidate for My Favourite Movie of the Year
","I didn't think much of the animation style of this movie when I saw the trailer, it didn't catch my eye and before I learned more about who was involved, my first thought was that it might be a straight to VOD or Blu Ray release. Getting to see it in the theatre, I was blown away. The animation is fantastic, it has its own sense of style, but the colour palette is bright, and the movie is constantly moving throughout its environments. It looks as good as any big studio animation movie for kids if not better. What makes it even more amazing is how the action scenes are put together. They're stunning, the movie is inventive with how they use their characters and you never lose focus of what's happening, but you feel the hits and each character gets bad@$$ moments to show what they can do. In a bloated superhero movie landscape, to get something that kept me this engaged from a visual standpoint is impressive.<br/><br/>I prefer my superhero characters to have rough edges and to have some flaws when they dole out justice. Its one of the reasons superheroes like Ironman or anti heroes like Deadpool work so well. I liked Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) as a character because he has a hard time picking up how to be Spiderman, because he has a hard time making the tough choices and because he's so new to this job. He also has some relatable problems (being homesick, trying to live up to expectations, having to choose between what's right and what's easy) that help endear him to the audience. He's a good kid at a difficult time in his life. I also like the fact that they have other superhero characters like Jake Johnson's Peter Parker, Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld) and others to provide some contrast to his style of being Spiderman. But you also have more human characters such as Jefferson (Brian Tyree Henry), Aaron (Mahershala Ali) that present more real-world consequences and represent the different branches he could take depending on what he chooses to do. Especially with his family, things get dark and they really sell the drama of what's going on with Miles and the consequences of his actions.<br/><br/>You've got both the action and the drama but the best part of Into the Spider-Verse is the comedy. This movie is gut-busting hilarious, the dialogue is razor sharp and they aren't afraid to get meta or to poke fun at the genre. I saw this with a friend and she described it as Deadpool for kids with the film pointing out dialogue boxes, going into comics for visual representations of origin stories and pulling scenes out of the Sam Raimi Spiderman movies and making jokes about them. So much of the funny content in this movie comes from the alternate universe Spidermen and Spiderwomen and more specifically the Jake Johnson version of Peter Parker. He nails line after line and left me giggling every time. One of the small complaints I had about this movie is that it was so entertaining as a comedy, when it got dramatic (and to be fair those parts are done well too) I waited on the edge of my seat till the jokes started flying again.<br/><br/>The voice cast is good across the board and other than my continuous praise for Jake Johnson, everyone does at minimum a descent job. Again, some of my favourites were the alternate universe Spidermen with Nicolas Cage, John Mulaney, Hailee Steinfeld (Gwen is in that category) and Kimiko Glenn all doing unique takes on their characters to round out the cast. Chris Pine is solid in his all too brief appearance as Peter. I really like Mahershala Ali and Brian Tyree Henry as Aaron and Jefferson. Liev Schrieber does what he can as Kingpin, he doesn't get many dialogue heavy scenes, but he gets the job done. I also thought while Shameik was decent as Miles, he gave more of a nondescript performance.<br/><br/>This movie was an outright joy to watch. I had heard it was good going in, but it surpassed high expectations. My advice is don't just lump Spider-Verse into the group, it represents what superhero movies need to do to avoid plateauing. You have to change things up and try new things and I think this version of Spider-Man did that for sure. I'm eagerly awaiting a sequel from the same team and although I was late to see this, don't make the same mistake if you love this genre. I wholeheartedly recommend Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and I was close to giving it a 10/10 but I'll still go 9/10 for a couple of small missteps."

","I so want to agree with everyone that this movie was amazing and fantastic and perhaps the best thing since the invention of sliced bread, but when you look closely there are significant problems.<br/><br/>Let's start with what was good;<br/><br/>1, the comprehensive construction of Miles as a personality, from his dialogue to his jokes from his singing to his clumsiness, this was realised in micro-gestures and facial expressions as was Miles' father and uncle, a brilliant piece of animation.<br/><br/>2, the movie created a comprehensive atmosphere and style and was planned and executed to an inch of its life.<br/><br/>3, you were gripped from the start, whilst watching the movie there was a great dramatic impetus, you were desperate for a conclusion.<br/><br/>4, the music, graphics and minute detail was all brilliantly realised.<br/><br/>What was not good;<br/><br/>1, if you take out the character development, that must be secondary to the story, we have boy infected by spider, trying to stop the Kingpin from using a machine to bring back his dead family, this is hardly a substantial story.<br/><br/>2, if, and I believe it is the case, that the story above was incidental and that the ""real"" story was ""everyone can wear the mask"" this is using or abusing the vehicle of Spider-Man to advance forward a political agenda.<br/><br/>3, if we had a parallel dimension then Spider-Man would be the same in each dimension, just as New York was the same in each dimension, if we had a alternative dimension then nothing would be the same so there would perhaps not be a Spider-Man, this was jumbled thinking at its best, which is it?<br/><br/>4, we had blatant gender and racial appropriation and a whole array of divisive stereotyping that was used to underpin a political agenda, it was perhaps even gross tokenism, let's say no more.<br/><br/>It cannot be right to use a movie to promote ideologies of globalisation, political correctness and identity politics and embed this within the core of a movie and this needs to be called out for what it is, this is indoctrination and liberal authoritarianism bordering on brainwashing.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the movie whilst I was watching it but afterwards I felt I had been cheated, preached at and manipulated to a political world view, that is the latest Hollywood fashion trend, that places identity above everything and we are all citizens of nowhere."

","Glorious. There simply is no other word for ""Into The Spider-verse"" a fun, thrilling, funny, self-referential trip through the history of Spider-man, in both film and comics. It's one of the best films I've seen this year and one of the best animated films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The Kingpin (Leiv Schreiber) is conducting dangerous experiments under the streets of Brooklyn, opening wormholes to alternate dimensions. Aside from bringing through a radioactive spider, which bites young Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), the wormhole also drags through various versions of Spiderman from across the multiverse, who must team up to put an end to the Kingpins plans and save the multiverse.<br/><br/>The animation style of ""Spiderverse"" is top notch. A beautiful blend of 3D computer animation and 2D elements. Occasionally aspects are ripped directly from the pages of the comics too, with sound effects written on screen or occasionally splitting the image in to panels. It's a unique and dynamic experience. That would be for naught though if the script and story wasn't up to much, so fortunately the film excels here too. The story finds a legitimate excuse to drag the various Spidys together and actually gives them something to do. It's funny too, self-referential to the universe, to the medium and to the film itself. The highlight of the humour is probably ""Spiderman Noir"" a 1930's detective version of the web slinger, whose whole world is monochromatic and is voiced with laconic style by Nicolas Cage.<br/><br/>It does have some darker moments though, a couple of deaths that would be a bit much for some of the younger children in the audience. Stan Lee's cameo too, though nothing specific about the cameo is sad, it still pretty emotional for his first one since he passed (if you ignore ""Ralph Breaks The Internet""). Also, at least in the screening I saw, occasionally the image seemed to .... Duplicate somewhat ... as if you were watching a 3D film without glasses on.<br/><br/>But those minor detractions won't take away from a magnificent film that I'd really like to see more of."

","This movie is not only going to redefine what an animated movie should look like, it's going to raise the expectation level of what any superhero movie should feel like. The creators combined traditional animation with pixar-style animation and then went even further and developed a new way of blending colors, text, dialogue and music so the audience feels like they are living inside a comic book. I actually tried to find a scene or moment where the animators maybe cheaped out or half-assed something and I couldn't. Every scene, every sequence . . . hell, every frame was stunning.<br/><br/>The protagonist is Miles Morales, an accidental spiderman set in our world and the writers do a great job of really developing him well in a very short time. An alternate universe Peter Parker also enters our world and his character harkens back to the Sam Raimi films and genuflects to Raimi's Spiderman 1 and 2 and justifiably jibes Spiderman 3. There's also Spiderwoman, Film Noir Spiderman, Anime Spidergirl and Spiderpig. If I had any complaint, it's that these last three characters seem tacked on in anticipation of sequels or extended universe planning.<br/><br/>Also, this movie had hands-down the best Stan Lee cameo ever. You may think it's more sentimental because of his passing just recently and that may be a factor but I assure you that's not why it's great. It's like they finally figured out the best way to portray the great creator in a way fitting to his legacy.<br/><br/>Also, Definitely stick around until the very end of the credits. Yes, I'm pointing at you!"

"djbattick","1","18","49","3 March 2019"," FRUSTRATING
","This film along with the vast majority of other marvel films is heavily overrated. It genuinely infuriates me that it has the same rating as City of God, Spirited Away, Interstellar and Silence of The Lambs. Please people, explore the world of cinema before you watch this and score it 10/10.<br/><br/>Let's be honest;
The story majorly lacked character development. An unavoidable fault however, as the audience raving about it are the same people who can't sit through a 2hr+ film without pulling out their phones and branding it ""boring"". The plot concept was fun and very interesting, but execution was mediocre at best. You could predict the entire film from watching the trailer to be honest. A lack of development in to key events made the majority of the watch emotionless. Huge opportunities like the passing of Fisk's wife, or the fact that all the alternate Spidermen could disintegrate; were brushed over. Though not exactly a Hans Zimmer masterpiece, the sound was okay. The picture also wasn't to my taste, however I appreciate the creativity and intention.<br/><br/>I'll admit 1/10 is a harsh, I'd actually give it a 6.5 or 7, I was only trying to level things out. It's just unfair that this is going to be remembered as one of the top 20 films in history because of uneducated raters who find Blade Runner:2049 confusing, but think Spiderman is ""the best movie ever cos of awesome fight scenes and tonnes of action"".<br/><br/>P.s. I'm not being boring and a superhero film hater. The Christopher Nolan batman films are my favourite trilogy in history. I appreciate all genres, this was just poor execution."

It would have been great as a short film or something."

","I have to say, Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse did not disappoint! In fact, it was better than I thought it was going to be.<br/><br/>They add lots of humor but not too much humor and they literally have you jump right in. Story line was written and executed really well, you just automatically connect with the characters and although some parts at least to me could be a little sappy, the film in its entirety was amazing.<br/><br/>I would also like to point out that the music used in this movie was fantastic! Yes the story matters and yes the quality of production also matters, but to me the music throughout a film is really important. If you don't have the right music/sound, but everything else is perfect, it kills the mood. The music sets the tone throughout the movie and that's exactly what they did with this movie.<br/><br/>I will definitely be buying this when it comes out on dvd and blue ray and would definitely pay to see it a second time. Job well done and can't wait to see what's next for this storyline."
"elicopperman","9","8","18","16 December 2018"," The Best Spiderman Venture in Years
","If there's one notable superhero with a very hit or miss track record when it comes to their film adaptations, it has to be Marvel's iconic Spider-Man. Whether they be the right blend of goofiness and emotional drama with Sam Raimi's trilogy, or the embarrassingly lackluster Amazing Spider-Man series, the web slinging hero has been through as many duds as successes. However, there has never really been an animated feature with this hero or any incarnations....until now. Ever since the first trailer dropped last year, the buzz for this particular film blew up, mainly due to it focusing on a new Spider-Man, Brooklyn teenager Miles Morales. After finally seeing it, I can officially confirm that the wait was beyond worth it.<br/><br/>The main storyline revolves around Miles Morales becoming the next Spiderman after getting bitten by a radioactive spider. However, the evil Kingpin creates a portal to other universes that goes haywire and ends up pulling distinct versions of Spider-Man into Miles' world. Upon meeting Peter Parker, Miles now has to take Kingpin down and bring those incarnations back. With all that said, the film rests on Miles' shoulders to lead, and he is one hell of a protagonist. Alongside being very likable, the film does a great job of establishing his relationships, personality and even emotions. I also like how he only grows accustomed to his powers after many trials and tribulations with all the craziness going around. Even his interactions with Peter Parker feel like that of an apprentice learning from a master, they're so much fun to watch.<br/><br/>In addition, the film happens to be a great blend of self referential humor and emotional drama. Screenwriters Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman cram in plenty of in-jokes for hardcore Spider-Man fans in a subtle manner without losing newcomers, making them feel connected within the narrative. As for the emotional weight, it stems from Miles' different bonds between his father and uncle Aaron, and both are well woven into the plot. There are even scenes with the two around Miles that one would never expect from a film like this. For a film with several villains, they all have just enough screen time to be memorable, especially Kingpin, mainly because his reasons behind making the portal are more elaborate than first assumed. Never has a superhero film managed to squeeze in the right amount of humor and pathos to work well as a part comedy and part drama since The Incredibles and The Lego Batman Movie.<br/><br/>As for the other characters, Peter Parker is established as the pessimistic hero turned failure, yet his relation with Miles gains him more confidence to get back into the swing of things (no pun intended). Throughout the film, we really feel for the guy and want him to succeed as much as Miles, making him come off as a sympathetic albeit charismatic mentor. Gwen Stacy is also appropriately placed within the film's narrative, as rather than being a Mary Sue, she plays as a voice of reason to Miles and hopes the best for him, like a real partner should do. As for the multiple dimensions featured, there's the 1930s serious dramatic Spider-Noir, the goofy and comical Spider-Ham, and the bubbly anime girl Peni Parker. While not given as much attention as Miles and Peter, they still end up stealing the show with their distinct quirks and charm, and their voice actors, especially Nic Cage, bring them to life as much as the script and animators do. It's rare when a film is able to squeeze in so many characters yet still manages to give them enough presence to leave an impact.<br/><br/>Lastly, the animation is incredibly versatile, vivid, colorful and even grim, really emulating the feel of a graphic comic book. The characters are all uniquely designed based on their appearance and personality, especially the Spider-Man incarnations looking distinct based on their physical appearance. Spider-Noir is black & white with shadows all around, Spider-Ham is very cartoony and bouncy, and Peni Parker is every anime girl ever made cranked up to 11. Not to mention, the action scenes are fantastically well directed, as the stakes really rise up with a lot of well choreographed fighting moves and a briskly paced flow. It's also worth praising how the film conveys its emotions through the color scheme depending on the scene, saying way more than any amount of dialogue ever could. My only issue with the animation is that it can look a little blurry at times, but that's more of a nitpick as it's intentionally built that way.<br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse has got to be my absolute favorite addition in the Spiderman film franchise. It also might be the most imaginative and innovative comic book film on screen in years thanks to its wonderful stylistic choices, humorous antics, well woven drama, and characters you will never forget. If you are yet to see this, please give this film as much support as you can, it's definitely a blast to sit through. We rarely get superhero films like this nowadays, so giving it the attention it deserves will mean more sequels and huge cult status for years to come. Sony Pictures Animation has only scratched the surface with what Miles Morales can do, so here's to more great adventures with the new up and coming Spider-Man in the future."
"eparazak","9","8","18","15 December 2018"," Easily my favorite of the animated superhero movies I've seen
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is the latest movies from Sony Picture Animation and is about the coming of age of Miles Morales, the next Spiderman. After getting bitten by a radioactive spider, he gains the powers of Spiderman and after a run-in with Kingpin, he meets Spiderman variations from different universes and needs to work together to stop him from ending the universe.<br/><br/>2018 has been a large year for superhero films and I gotta admit I was excited for this one, mostly because of the animation style. When that's taken out, I really enjoyed this movie. The animation's style looks like a 3D version of a literal superhero comic book, and the pacing makes it feel like one too. The action is fast-paced, crisp and it really made me wonder what was going to happen next. That alone makes this film stand out from any other mainstream animated movie, which feels really refreshing.<br/><br/>Aside from that, I enjoyed the company of every protagonist. Every Spiderman variation has a different charm to them that makes each one memorable. Take the main character Miles, who has to come to terms with accepting his father's wishes in being a better person by not looking up to his uncle instead. I think that arc was handled really well. I could go deeper into come of the other characters, but that would spoil parts of the movie.<br/><br/>If I were to name a couple small issues with the movie, I do think it contains a weakness that most good Marvel movies share and that's a good villain. Kingpin for the most part felt pretty generic and didn't seem to have much character going for him. Aside from that, I do wish they could've gone more in-depth with Miles' relationship with his father. I have no problem with the execution of it, but I would've like to have seen more.<br/><br/>Despite this, I highly recommend seeing this for superhero movie fans, comic book fans and animation fans. It's got amazing animation, great characters, an engaging story and lots of heart.<br/><br/>9/10"

Now, I'm not a comic book fan, nor an MCU fan although I've enjoyed a few, especially ""Spider-Man Homecoming,"" which I loved as I'm a sucker for those teenage, coming of age tales. The animation style was lovely in this movie but, the plot was humdrum and there was little character development and none of the witty repartee that is such a hallmark of the best animated films that appeal to both children and adults. This should have focused on Miles Morales getting a disillusioned Peter Parker to train him and get his mojo back. THe other iterations of Spider-Man were unnecessary. This was truly little more than a mediocre kids' animated movie. The small audience in my Friday morning theater was exclusively adult and there was little reaction from the audience throughout. Sitting in the Dolby theater, with the recliner in use, I actually thought about taking a snooze at least a couple of times during the movie."

","I'm watching this movie as I write this review. It's weird. I've seen hundreds of movies, from fantasy to sci fi, horror and everything in between. I've seen LOTR, Titanic, Into the Wild, and so many others and all of those movies had something that would made me feel. Feel the history, the characters and their pain or their joy. And... there's Spider Man - Into the Spider Verse. And it's the first time I shed a tear in a movie.
Spider man's death is one of the most powerful scenes I've came across in any media in any genre.
Spider man. Our friendly neighbourhood Parker. Its has been with us, with you and me, for more than 30 years an for some, more than 50. Whether you like comics, books, movies, games, cups, magnets, toys, he's been with you. And, in a brief moment, for those who knew the character and the humanity he brought into a 2 dimensional universe where everyone with a cape can be Super, but not a man, we felt the pain. The pain of those who in that fictional universe, lost, such an amazing person. We felt it and we morn it as if it was one of our beloved friends taken from us, because this, this is how BIG, more than life itself, this character is.
This moment, and the incredibly gorgeous animation is in, deserves my respect. I salute you, animator, director, sound designer, voice actor, coffee boy, donut boy, and every single person that worked in it: Congratulations, you made an outstanding job and I sincerely believe that, if alive, Stan Lee would aplaude it as loudly as I did.

Its visually stunning for an animation film and manages to be lively throughout by mixing humor and action like the Homecoming movie. But too often the characters are left under developed like the Spiderman Noir which really was disappointing because I was looking forward for Nicolas Cage. The soundtrack was fine and the song placements were perfect and as for the casting goes its very diverse and is a good representation for BAME.

"secretzfan","9","5","10","24 December 2018"," Spider-Verse revives people's love for Miles Morales
","A Review from a comic book nerd XD<br/><br/>When going into Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse I was very excited. I had been reading Miles Morales since 2014 alongside Kamala Khan, and while I never loved him as much as I loved Kamala I had always enjoyed the story of Miles in the Ultimate Universe. He felt different from Peter Parker as he was more grounded in his responsibility to his family first. He was never defined by some major death of a family member the way Peter was, but rather instead by the loss of his Peter Parker. He became Spider-Man to honor his Peter's legacy, and that felt like a solid motivation to me.<br/><br/>Back in the Ultimate Universe era Bendis was on a hot streak with Jessica Jones, Daredevil, and other street level heroes. This fine tuned writing really did well for the Ultimate Spider-Man as he would eventually create a really powerful bond between 616 Peter Parker and the 1610 one, and it was this relationship that I was elated to see get portrayed on the big screen.<br/><br/>However there was one major worry I had about this film, and that was the entire concept of the spider verse. I just never liked the idea of a billion spider characters all coming together in one big giant event, and I defiantly didn't want it in Miles's first movie when he should be the focus. It also made me feel like these writers didn't think Miles could stand on his own which also irked me. Luckily though in the film these other characters don't take away from the character of Miles Morales as the film still revolves around him. The other Spider characters are kind of just there to help felt the big bad, and because the film is still called ""Into the Spider-Verse,"" but there not major. I did like Spider-Man Noir a lot, and also Penni Parker was cool too.<br/><br/>In regards to the animation for the film I felt it always looked pretty crisp and clean. I liked the style of allowing a comic book come to life in animation. It allows for it to feel more realistic, and for the colors to start to pop more. You can tell that the writers put a lot of love and care when crafting this film with the stylization in mind. It is something that is both amazing and spectacular. Pun intended. :-P<br/><br/>There is quite a lot in the film that pulls from Miles's story in the Ultimate Universe. I really enjoyed seeing Ultimate Green Goblin realized on the big screen, and his battle against Peter Parker was absolutely great. I also loved the death of Ultimate Peter Parker as it both dark and brutal. I literally started to have goosebumps in the theater when watching it. There was also the bond between Aaron Davis and Miles that was captured perfectly, and when Aaron died it felt like my soul left my body.<br/><br/>That being said despite my love for this scene I did find Aaron's death to be a bit problematic. It makes Miles lose some of his individuality in my opinion. And with the movie trying so hard to get us to see that Miles is more than a Peter Parker knock off the idea that Miles would need another major loss to define him really undercuts his development. Especially when we have a more compelling story to tell with his relationship with his Uncle were Miles is caught between the world of crime and the world of a hero.<br/><br/>Going into some performances I thought everyone did a pretty solid job. I thought Chris Pine's portrayal of Peter Parker was very original and a different take on the character. I found Jake Johnson's Peter to be absolutely amazing and quite memorable too. Hailee Steinfeild as Gwen Stacy was perfect casting in my opinion, and her friendship that she created with Miles was really heartfelt. And I can't wait for that to be developed more if we ever get a sequel to this movie.<br/><br/>Overall this was a exceptional film with a really heartfelt story. It understands what makes Miles a really compelling character, and was just a lot of fun to watch on screen, and so for that reason and others I truly believe that this movie deserves many accolades."

Blending a heartfelt story, well-timed humor, and a bold animation style, Spider-Verse is the best Spider-Man film to date, and one that should garner all sorts of accolades. If it wasn't for an ending that gets bloated with hectic animation, it could flirt with some of my favorite animated movies of all time list.

","99% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which is the Highest rated DC and Marvel movie EVER! And an 8.6 IMDB rating...so i had high hopes going in, plus i love the previous Spider-Man movies but boy was this one average, below average actually hence my 4/10. I feel duped by the critics AGAIN. The critics scores for this movie are WAY too suspicious for this.<br/><br/>Let's get the animation out of the way first since they seem to be raving about it so much. Through watching many many animations we all know that nice visuals don't make for an entertaining film, especially if the other components of storytelling don't add up. The animation was as good as any good ones out there already, so i would say that it's not a good reason to go and spend loads on money at the cinema for that reason alone. This definitely can be watched at home. At random times throughout the film they do this kind of 3D visuals animation which give your eyes and head a funny turn tbh. If you've watched a 3D movie without glasses then you'll know what i mean.<br/><br/>The film was so haphazard editing and story wise that it really took you out of the flow of the story, so it made it difficult to stay connected to the characters and story. This made it feel like it was aimed at young children to stop them from losing interest. It almost just felt like constant random scenes which didn't flow smoothly story wise.<br/><br/>The other thing that made the film tiresome when trying to connect to the characters/story was the use of jokes/one-liners, they were relentless and was full of them. I love comedy in superhero films, the MCU do a great job of that and the previous Spider-Man movies too but this was like a kids animation style of non-stop but with adult humour, that i'm afraid i didn't laugh at once...and i usually laugh at nearly everything. Besides myself, there was only an adult and 2 children in the screen and i didn't hear them laugh either tbh.<br/><br/>The story was pretty standard, exactly what the trailer tells you but i did get restless and bored when there was no action.<br/><br/>Its my least favourite Spider-Man movie and as animations go its not good either, especially when you've got Pixar, Illuniation, Manga, etc delivering such epic and fun movies already.<br/><br/>Nicolas Cage was my favourite Spider-Man in this, even though he wasn't one of the central characters and didn't get much screen time. It would be great if they made a film just centered around his character sometime.<br/><br/>There were 2 or 3 short emotional scenes in this that i liked, i'm a sucker for that stuff lol.<br/><br/>There is a post-credits scene so stay til the very end.<br/><br/>4/10."

","I had no great expectations at all. Let's start with that. I haven't seen a single picture of the movie, so I had no idea what I was going to watch.<br/><br/>I've seen the great reviews of it, some stating that they were expecting something super overrated and it turned out to be the opposite.
So.<br/><br/>Here I'm. Long story short, I accept the fact that the majority of the people who have seen this have low needs. That's why movies such as Roma for example generated only $3m at the box office. People in general need easy movies, don't have to think at all, more colours the better, some silly jokes and there you go.
That's why they don't make movies like the Fight Club today. Those kinda movies don't get the money to be made because people wouldn't watch them. Sick and might be hard to accept for some of you, but it's true. De Palma and many others states that people tasted Cola and now they only want to drink Cola.<br/><br/>This movie was predictable. I didn't like the style of it, but it was ok. New, but not good. It had it's silly jokes, many nonsense things. TONS of PLOTHOLES.
Also it was easy. VERY EASY. If you have seen any Spider-Man movie, series or something, then you have already seen this movie. Literally.<br/><br/>I was just waiting when comes that moment that will lift this movie up that would make it to deserve it's score. I was truly hopefully waiting until the ending. Every scene somehow just kept bringing more and more nonsense things into the way, not even caring about the rules of the movie itself. Then at the end we had a Clark Kent moment, when he puts his glasses on and nobody can recognize him and the movie ended.<br/><br/>Visually wasn't good. Have seen far better visuals in an animated movie.
The best thing about the movie was the uncle's theme song. I liked that.<br/><br/>Otherwise this movie is no different from the most of those that take place in the top250.<br/><br/>Not even close to The Lion King, Your Name, Spirited Away, Grave of the Fireflies. Even Monster Inc. had more in it.<br/><br/>It is currently no. 26 and with it the no1 animated movie. Which is funny because it had 1 Oscar nomination only. WALL-E had 6. Toy Story 3 was even nominated as best feature. Both of these movies and better by far.<br/><br/>So, in my opinion this movie is just a great example of what people need today and how easy it is to impress them. It was far harder before.<br/><br/>It is going to win it's award for the same reason. But it wouldn't even deserve to be nominated. Hollywood is full of people that don't know what a movie is or should be, they just take part of making one trash like this."

"FrostySlushy","9","3","5","4 March 2019"," One of my favorite animated movies in a long time
","Probably one of my personal favorite animated films I've seen. First things first. The animation style is utterly stunning with an incredible attention to detail. Never before has there been an animated film that looks and feels more like a comic book and it works so phenomenally well for this movie.<br/><br/>In addition the movie is perhaps one of the better written big budget films in a long time. It's emotional and funny, serious and lighthearted in all of the right places and unlike basically every other comic book movie ever, there's no stupidly placed jokes to ruin the emotional scenes. Bottom line: it's very tonally consistent and that makes me very happy.<br/><br/>The performances are all outstanding too with Shameik Moore doing an outstanding job leading the film. Jake Johnson and Hailee Steinfeld are both great too. It's well edited and shot wonderfully with some great action and an incredibly mature tone (which is personally one of my favorite things to see in a kid's movie). There's so little that seems to be without quality.<br/><br/>The only real thing I didn't really enjoy was the inclusion of Spider-Ham and making Spider-Man Noir a little too goofy and random for my taste. Some of their scenes are funny but overall I think the movie would've been stronger without them.<br/><br/>Oh and the licensed soundtrack is fantastic too with some great old school rap and hip hop. Definitely makes the film a lot more enjoyable."
"Donatien3","10","3","5","4 March 2019"," A Fresh Spin on Spidey
","After a wonderful Tom Holland-led reboot in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (with 'Civil War', 'Homecoming' and 'Infinity War'), Spider-Man is bankable again.<br/><br/>'Into the Spider-Verse' capitalises on that momentum with a fresh take on Spider-Man lore and taking advantage of the deep roster of Spider men and women.<br/><br/>There are seven Spideys in this glorious animated film: current day Spider-Man (Chris Pine), Peter B. Parker's fatter, lazier Spider-Man ('New Girl's' Jake Johnson), Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), Spider-Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld), Noir Spider-Man (Nicholas Cage, redeeming his superhero cred after Ghost Rider), Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn) and cartoon parody Spider-Ham (John Mulaney). While it's a small selection of the massive Spider-Verse from the comics, it's enough for this film. All the Spideys are distinct: Peter B. Parker is a slobby, divorced has-been; Spider-Gwen gives a younger, female perspective; Peni Parker has the anime cutesiness and technology; Noir Spider-Man has the old-fashioned lingo and confusion over a Rubik's Cube; and Spider-Ham has 'Looney Tunes' cartoon silliness.<br/><br/>Being a superhero film, there's the necessary origin story for Miles, but it's different enough to not be rehashing the same old boring tale. Miles' journey follows the familiar beats before a final confrontation with Kingpin (Liev Schreiber), which takes place in a multi-colour multi-world purgatory. It's incredibly ambitious and it works.<br/><br/>There's a fine sense of humour, with lots of references to previous Spider-Man films (taking a gleeful shot at the embarrassing 'Spider-Man 3'), the comics (when Miles first develops his powers, his thoughts are illuminated in comic panels) and a wonderful cameo from Stan Lee. It's also nice to see Lily Tomlin's Aunt May as a badass who has her own Spider lair rather than a frail old woman who has no idea that Peter is Spider-Man.<br/><br/>If you love Spider-Man, this is essential viewing."

","Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse was a visually stunning and expertly made Spider-Man movie. The animation was absolutely fantastic. It felt and looked realistic, and all the visuals were immersive and very impressive to witness. The main cast of characters were fantastically written as well, each with their own flaws and motivations to drive their actions and how they moved the plot forward. Miles Morales, Peter B. Parker, Spider-Gwen, and the others were each given great heroes' journey and stood on their own as part of the universe this movie created. The storyline is solid and gripping, able to grab onto you and keep you invested in a plot full of action, heart, humor, and it's many twists. The villains (Kingpin and Prowler) were both well written and intriguing parts of the story. Other than that, the soundtrack and the voice acting was great, and the inspiring messages woven into the movie were amazing. One of the best Spider-Man movies to date."

If you don't like this movie, it's probably because you don't get a lot of the references and subliminal jokes and jabs; I've been reading spiderman comics my whole life, and was delighted to see so many alternate versions of the spider person represented on-screen. I'm also an avid animation fanatic, and even animate some myself. To see so many styles and artistic designs fused together in a seamless, comic book way is breathtaking. I wasn't expecting so much from this movie, I honestly wasn't even excited to see it.

Yet I didn't expect to be overwhelmed with just how enjoyable, actually funny and heartwarming the film was in the end surpassing what I wanted from the trailers being a good action spectacle film and thatd be it but instead getting a *Fantastic* action spectacle film with great heart and actual character to it which just happened to have phenomenal animation on top of it .<br/><br/>Every single character was wonderful, Miles alone was a fantastic lead character with a great arc throughout his story, with all their chemistry being extremely snappy and well written with each of them bouncing off the other naturally and with great humor, a self aware tone not often captured by the other movies at least not to as effective a degree, between them making every scene a delight just to watch along with the stellar direction of each of them. Which is the same throughout the movie especially with flawless fight scenes with perfect choreography and cinematography with not a single fight less then spectacular all the while the art style making each fight feel unique and distinct from one another.<br/><br/>The ST was extremely different and actually memorable for a Marvel movie actually complementing the film well with many tracks fitting extremely well to make each scene impact feel much more weighty.<br/><br/>Importantly though this film captured everything that I wanted from Spider-Man as a character and concept with flawless execution from the music to the visuals to the characters overall just being a fantastic film being the best Marvel film I've ever seen and just a fantastic and fun film all around."

I will say however that the editing is so sharp and quick, that I thought I was going to have an epileptic fit! Also it played on the 3D blur that the old red and blue comic strips had, which sometimes made me slightly troubled as to whether I was in a 3D showing with no glasses!<br/><br/>The story was half decent, especially around Miles and his family. I thought his relationship with his uncle was particularly a strong point. No spoilers here though!<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie, I once again will reiterate that Spider-Man in general is feeling exhausted. No matter what is done with the character whether it's Miles or Peter. We have been watching these characters since Toby brought him to the big screen nearly 20 years ago, being rebooted over and over.

","I am notre a huge fan of any of the Spiderman movies from the last decade. Raimi's trilogy, the Amazing films, and homecoming though good had a lot of major flaws. This time they focus on a different Spiderman and the overall message of the movie is that basically anyone could be Spiderman. This idea allows the spectator to easily relate to the main character which works perfectly. You feel everything the lead is going through, from his excitement to his fears. I'm not usually a big fan of origin stories, but this one I really loved. I guess the movie might be a little bit difficult to follow if you're going blind into the movie (if you don't know anything about Spiderman before watching this one). But aside from that it's an extremely creative movie, with compelling characters and amazing pop-style animation (very stylized so it might not appeal to everyone but it definitely worked for me). The comedy works, the drama is also effective, I just don't see any major flaw especially comparer to other Spiderman films. It's just a great movie that almost redeems Sony animation for making the emoji movie. I really hope it does well in theaters and that we can get a sequel because this spiderverse has a lot of potential if it's treated this way."

"Benslie","10","9","23","15 December 2018"," Perfect movie for everybody
","First of all, I love the animation style in this film. The animation in this film is styled to look like an actual comic book. I think this approach for this kind of film was an excellent choice because we've all seen the usual kind of animation but nothing like this. To tie in with the animation I need to talk about the action scenes in this film. These tie in with the animation because of the way the directors styled the action shots is to look like something in a comic panel. Most people don't know who Miles Morales is and after this film, you'll want to learn more about him because of how they made him so relatable in this film. He acts like a typical teen in this situation compared to other versions of Spider-Man. Other versions kind of just acted like they always knew how to use their powers when Miles struggles with his. Miles isn't the only relatable character film all of them are. The creators of this film did a ""Marvel""ous job at making each character in this film somebody at least one person in the audience can relate to. All of the voice actors did a great job in their respected roles but it would've been nice to have a returning voice to at least one of the Spider-Man. It would've been cool to hear a returning voice even if it was for a few seconds. I have to talk about the humour in this film. It isn't overpowered in this film and I felt like it had just the right amount of humour that will make everybody laugh. They poke fun of things that wouldn't make sense in a real movie and other Spider-Man movies. Not a single moment in this film felt rushed or slowed down every scene felt the right pace for a movie like this. The cinematography in this movie was spectacular. This is probably because of it looking like a comic book and how the lighting needs to match up with how it would look in an actual book. If you are a comic book junkie you'll love all of the easter eggs in this film. Some of them just comic book readers will get but others a majority of people will understand. The music in this film is fantastic. Every song in this film isn't overused and matches perfectly with the age of the character. Somebody Miles age would be listening to the type of music he listens to. And the music without lyrics helps increase the emotion in the film. Also, there are two end credit scenes that are worth waiting for. In the end, this film is perfect for everybody."

","The visuals gave me a headache due to the choppiness of the framerate. I personally found the story to be clichÃ©d, and I did not connect with any of the characters beyond surface level. The film has tonal stability, and it is well directed, but I just did not connect with it the way I do so many other animated features. I would give it a 6/10, a one time watch for me. A solid film for kids, but nothing more. Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms is still the pinnacle of 2018 animation for me. Watch it and formulate your own opinions, but for me, again, I just did not see what all the hype was about"

","If I could give this a zero I would. Congratulations. You just bumped Forrest Gump into the second most boring movie of all time, and that is no small achievement. This movie was boring from the start, and only got worse. The voices of the characters made me think they picked people from a junior high play to read the parts and they were reading their lines for the first time, and they were recording in a studio with terrible acoustics. Terrible. Worst voice overs ever in an animated movie. The visuals were unappealing, the music was extremely annoying, and I don't know how anyone over age 5 could enjoy this movie."

"realmuthaf","9","7","17","16 December 2018"," Puts the ""Amazing"" back into ""Spider-Man""
","I didn't quite expect this level of good when going to the cinema - Into The Spider-Verse ended up delivering on pretty much everything.<br/><br/>The jokes are actually funny - no underage cringy garbage shoehorned by Disney into their movies. Special thanks to Nicholas ""Noir"" Cage. The visual style is astonishing, pays close homage to the comics, but still looks distinct and aesthetically pleasing. The drama here surprisingly works, and some moments in this movie are very far from being childish. Of course the Spider-Verse also has a ton of references to everything from the Raimi trilogy to the recent PS4 game, and they're also great, make sure to stay for the after-credits scene. Even the protagonist Morales also works, as opposed to the aforementioned PS4 game, where he was kind of dull.<br/><br/>So yeah, miles (no pun intended) ahead of the MCU and of Sony's own previous live-action attempts, Into The Spider-Verse is a great animated movie, totally looking forward to the announced spin-off and sequel."
"cybersane-1","6","20","63","16 December 2018"," Animation style was aweful
","The plot was decent, characters were OK even if there were a few too many of them. The action was intense for a PG movie, perhaps a little too much. I probably would have rated this PG-13 and then not brought my 5yo daughter. She was jumping out of her seat several times when scary monsters with fangs break onto the screen unexpectedly with loud noises.<br/><br/>The worse part was the animation style though. There are lots of reviews praising this but either my theater messed up, or the animation style was just terrible. It was like watching a 3D movie without your 3D glasses. Everything in the background had that 3 color hue around it. Foreground stuff was fine, but it simply made the background art look terrible. I had to look around the theater a few times, and double check my tickets to make sure we hadn't gotten into a 3D movie without the glasses. If anyone calls this an art style, I'll call it cheap editing to save money on making a 3D version."
"jhalcollege","3","25","82","22 December 2018"," Yikes
","This movie is definitely not as good as everyone is making it out to be.<br/><br/>The movie starts off simply enough. Miles is your average Hollywood teen, who is the son of the only police officer in New York City. And if you want to see yet another person get bitten by a radioactive spider, then you're in luck.<br/><br/>75% of the film is Miles trying and failing to be Spiderman. He's incapable of controlling any of his powers, and does little more than get in the way and utter cliche lines such as ""I have to do this. I promised."" It's rather frustrating to watch. But conveniently, he figures everything out in the last half hour and becomes a better hero than all the other Spidermen who've been in the business for years.<br/><br/>Speaking of everyone else, as the story progresses, the audience is introduced to more and more Spiderman variations (and more unusual villains). With so much content, they barely get any more than just a few minutes of screen time. Spiderman Noir was interesting, for the five lines he had. I'm pretty sure there was some kind of Penny Porker character, but I may be mistaken. There's also a Scorpion villain who shows up out of nowhere, then mostly disappears.<br/><br/>As a whole, the movie was filmed assuming that the audience's attention span is a about 1 second. Most jokes are cringe worthy, especially after you've seen them in the trailer. There's also way too much flash going on, and the movie's final scene is about as visually complex as a Jackson Pollock spatter painting.<br/><br/>Spiderverse doesn't do anything that hasn't been done time and again."

","The main character is a little aloof brat! I could not stand 10 minutes of this little brat whining and arguing and ignoring his father! He is so disrespectful. Maybe he gets better and I don't know what the original Miles was like but I don't care to watch anymore. I don't know why everyone finds him so likeable, he's so overrated.

"WisdomsHammer","6","4","8","2 July 2019"," A Disney Spider-Man where some things worked and some didn't.
","Ok, first of all, if you are ages 8-11 and like super hero movies I think this maybe might be your thing. Maybe. I think it's aimed at more like 15 year olds but they forgot and made most of it a silly cartoon. Oh well.<br/><br/>Overall, I did like this. I had fun and thought it was entertaining. But it's not a 10. It's a 7 probably. There are too many things that don't work for me.<br/><br/>Probably my biggest beef in this thing is that our hero goes from zero to hero in ONE SCENE.<br/><br/>Not exaggerating, he goes from a kid so dumb that he plays in traffic, refuses to tie his shoe, can't walk down a hallway without bumping into people, and just stands there with his mouth open most of the time (this happens so often in the first three quarters of the movie that it's repetitive - they really want to pound it into us just how dumb Miles is) to a courageous superhero in complete control of his faculties and sophisticated superpowers - IN ONE SCENE.<br/><br/>Come on! Where's the training montage? They tease a training montage in several wasted scenes and never give us one. Training montages have worked since kung fu movies and Rocky! Are we not doing those anymore? I think that's a mistake. But whatever.<br/><br/>And when exactly was his ""with great power comes great responsibility"" moment for making mature choices?<br/><br/>Where the hell did that spider come from? Why did it take so long to bite him? Why did it crawl over his entire body (without him feeling it) and then decide to bite his hand in particular when it could have bitten him anywhere? To give a two hour movie 5 minutes of padding?<br/><br/>What audience is this aimed at? We've got some great mature themes, coming of age themes, and we've got Spider-Pig. I guess they just decided to scattergun this thing and try to hit everyone. It's surprising that it works at all. Pixar does wide audiences well. This thing has individual scenes aimed at different audiences and it feels disjointed to me.<br/><br/>What worked for me:
<ul><li>The animation. Incredible.</li><li>The voice acting. Loved the performances. Disney does this very well.</li><li>Half the writing: Peter B. Parker's story in particular, Miles' relationship with his father and his uncle, Spider-Gwen (would have liked to have seen more of her and I bet we will).</li><li>All the easter eggs, from the comic books to the stupid theme song to the Gwen Stacy moment to the dumb finger pointing meme after the end credits and more.</li><li>The overall plot and storyline</li></ul><br/><br/>What didn't work for me:
<ul><li>Half the writing: How dumb they made Miles through the first three quarters of the movie, and putting him in complete control of his powers in a single scene in particular. Pace it out a little more!</li><li>Spider-Man Noir</li><li>Spider-Ham</li><li>Aunt May is apparently Spider-Man's version of Batman's Alfred now? NO.</li><li>Most of the silly slapstick cartoon humor</li><li>The character design and seemingly indestructable qualities of Kingpin</li><li>Individual storylines that seemed to be aimed at different audience demographics</li></ul><br/><br/>There's more I suppose, but this is a good enough run down. There are a lot of reviews out here so I'm doubting many will read this. I'm kind of writing this for myself to remember what I thought of this thing if I ever watch it again.<br/><br/>7/10 for me but I'm rating it 6 because there are WAY too many 10s here."

"MartinHafer","10","4","8","26 March 2019"," Fantastic...but possibly overwhelming.
","""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a fantastic film but might be a bit overwhelming for some viewers. It's filled with blaring hip-hop music and the animation is beyond splashy...it's competely intense! Now these are NOT criticisms...more a warning if you hate these sorts of things or if you or someone you loves has challenges, such as Autism....as the film might really be overwhelming. Still, I'm nearly 55 and loved the picture...and I think most will if they have an open mind and want something different. That DOES strongly apply to me, as I've gotten sick of superhero movies because there have been so many recently and there's a certain sameness about them...but not this Spider-Man film!<br/><br/>The story is told with breathtaking CGI--with a look that is nothing like any other film I've ever seen. In this world is a young man who sees Spider-Man killed and is also bitten by a spider and becomes the next incarnation of Spider-Man. But instead of taking the time to enjoy and learn about his new powers, this young man finds himself in the middle of a weird apocalyptic occurance---and all the various incarnations from the various universes come together to save the day.<br/><br/>Overall, amazingly creative...there's nothing else like it. This is more than reason enough to see it. Sadly, however, the film loses a bit on home TVs...even big ones as the scale and size of the film needs the big screen."
"Semisonic","6","4","8","10 March 2019"," A franchise on drugs
","Most of us have dreams. Not the ones about having a billion bucks or getting that girl, but the night time ones. So most of us would agree that in that twilight zone our brain unleashes its creativity, no longer bound by the constraints of reality, and that allows us to dream the most crazy and amazing stuff. And most bizarre and incoherent also. Especially if there were some substances consumed beforehand.<br/><br/>In that sense, I'd agree with those who say that Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an animation film we could dream for. I'm far from the comic book culture, but even I can admire the visual style of this film, made so that any still out of it could actually pass for a real comic book's frame. That aesthetics is brilliantly done, no questions about it.<br/><br/>The rest of admiration, however, heavily depends on how much you are into TV cartoons, comic books and Spider-Man himself. This film loves to reiterate over and over again that it's based on an established universe, so there's an abundance of Spider-Man movie references and other allusions. If such things make you gasp in awe and maybe even shed a tear of nostalgic affection, you'll love it all. But for me as a non-Spider-man-acolyte, this soon became somewhat boring. I wanted to see something new, something unexpected.<br/><br/>And something new I did receive! In the form of a slapstick action multiplied by the pseudo-scientific stuff as grotesquely absurd as it was far-fetched. And I can clearly see how Sony was inspired by the likes of Big Hero 6 and its outright fusion of the Western and Eastern kid entertainment culture, and of Ant-man and even Dr. Strange and their abundance of moving colored specks and nonsensical words in lieu of common sense. The deeper we go into the Spider-Verse, the more bizarre it looks, feels and acts, until we're forced to accept that there are no rules anymore to cling to and that pigs can indeed fly, just as trains.<br/><br/>I do appreciate bringing a new stylistic vision into the world of full feature animation. But I can't say as much about bringing a popcorn bucket of LSD along with it, turning everything into a final battle from Final Fantasy, with its constant sparkle and rush and a muffled feeling that it used to mean something, but now you can't remember what exactly and it's way too late to stop and think about it.<br/><br/>It was a fascinating trip while it lasted, but praising it as something more than that would be like retelling your dreams to someone else: you'd end up realizing how little sense your words make and feeling embarrassed about the whole idea."

The main villain also isn't one directional but rather complicated; had a reason for the collider and also a reason to hate all Spider-People.

That's how it's one of the most animated films. On the other hand, the characters sound and act like real people, bring raw emotion to the film.

","The best superhero movie of the year. The best-animated film of the year. The best Spider-Man movie. This movie is fun from beginning to end and is an absolute love letter to comicbooks. Character designs are lifted from the source, most specifically the Bill Sienkiewicz-inspired Kingpin. The animation is beautiful and uniquely stylized, creating its own rules so that it serves day-to-day scenes, fantastically kinetic action sequences, or the origin stories that literally burst from the comics pages.<br/><br/>While ""Black Panther"" explores the Blackness as a core concept, Miles Morales is an Afro-Latino teenage New Yorker. The film shows his world, his parents, his uncle, and he simply is. His identity is evident in all aspects of the movie, and even as more Spiders fill the cast, there is no question who is the lead.<br/><br/>The movie is an origin story that doesn't feel like an origin story because so much is happening, and when the veteran Spiders begin dropping in, it creates its own dynamic. This film's vocal cast is led by actors known for on-screen roles, but whose vocal abilities serve the product. The story is strong, the action exciting, the jokes are funny and the Easter Eggs are plentiful. It is the most overall satisfying superhero experience of the year."

But what if there were other Peter Parkers in the multiverse. And what if there were other Spider-Men too?! Into the Spider-Verse answers that very question when we come to know Miles Morales, a young man who's complicated life is about to get even more complicated when he succumbs to an alter-verse spider which transforms him into the latest addition of the spider family. Crossing paths with his verse's Spider-Man further complicates matters when he is forced to make a stand and do what he believes is the right thing to protect his world against the likes of Kingpin and a somewhat different Doc Ock...<br/><br/>Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse is an interesting take on the story and delivers fresh material that leaves you screaming for more.<br/><br/>It's Spider-Man done right."

","When I saw the teaser at the end of 2017 after Spider-Man Homecoming came out, I became really interested as did my brother and later this year we saw it on its second weekend. To our surprise, we loved it so much I consider it the number one movie of the year. Even more so than Avengers Infinity War.<br/><br/>Not only does it pay homage to the Spider-Man legacy, but it also respects everything that made it so iconic since the 1960s. The writing from Phil Lord who directed the 21 Jump Street movies, The Lego Movie, and Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs with Christopher Miller is very good making for some nice humor and really solid emotion and drama and the idea of other spider people coming from other dimensions is done really well. Also the character arc for Miles Morales, a likeable character by the way, is really compelling as he struggles to find who he is.<br/><br/>The music score is atmospheric and beautiful and the song choices don't feel out of place which is very rare. The pacing is really good and there's not even a dull moment. The directing from three directors including Peter Ramsey (who directed DreamWorks Animation's Rise of the Guardians) is superb and the voice acting is entertaining with Shameik Moore Jake Johnson Hailee Steinfeld Mahershala Ali Brian Tyree Henry Lily Tomlin Luna Lauren Velez John Mulaney Nicolas Cage Chris Pine and Leiv Schreiber giving fantastic performances.<br/><br/>And last but not least the action sequences and the animation which is by far the best elements of the movie. The Spider-Men costumes and the Spider-Women costumes are well detailed and the choreography for the action revolving around them are some of the best I've seen in animation history since the Kung Fu Panda franchise. Especially the leap of faith sequence which I'm sure you've all seen from the teaser trailer which was the highlight of the film to me.<br/><br/>Anyway, Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse is for my perspective the best Spider-Man movie and one of the best animated movies of 2018. A sequel and spinoff is in the works and with that, this receives a LordoftheFuture seal of approval. Go see it!"

"The_Man_XX7","9","4","8","24 December 2018"," Sony surprises me with the best Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2
","To be honest I didn't know what to expect from this movie it came from a studio that made amazing Spider Man films like SpiderMan 1 and 2. Then Sony made mediocre and almost bad films with The Amazing Spider-Man series and SpiderMan and Sony's animation films are hit and miss but some how they nailed it with this one.<br/><br/>First off the visuals and animation were amazing at first I thought it would be jarring but that wasn't the case as usually films which try to do movies in comic book style usually fails...cough Hulk(2003)cough.but luckly this is an animation movie so it works brilliantly so well done Sony. The characters in this movie are also well fleshed out and contributed to the story significantly in one way or another.Miles Morales and Peter Parker and Spider-Gwen were the best characters and each were a delight to watch,funny and more. And shout out to (spiderman) the peter parker voice actor who usually acts in comedy did great voice work for Peter Parker and I can confirm is very different to what you see in love action films but really captures the feel of Spiderman.<br/><br/>The movie was really bold as well from the different visuals the story involving parallel dimensions and universes which worked because you could see from glimpse that every universe felt different and unique.Also the film felt really mature even from a PG movie it felt like a hardcore PG film with its themes,drama and consequences especially the Kingpin charcter and a heartbreaking arc involving Peter Parker and I for one enjoyed that.The music was also nice.<br/><br/>Miles Morales who the story is based on is a good lead from the voice acting and up. You could see the struggle he was dealing with trying be Spiderman and the responsibility of it and that's what Spidernan has always been about with great power comes.....you know the line.His character grows and develops over time as he dealt with the trails and tribulations of being Spiderman and by the end it payed off which was nice to see. The main Villain Kingpin had a compelling reason for his evil actions and has kind of intimidating a bit like like the Netflix Kingpin, which was a really mature take on a pg movie so agian another plus for the movie although there some generic bad guy things and dumb decisions that villians make in this movie but since its a kids movie i'll just let it slide.<br/><br/>The other Spiderman people were really good too like Spiderman Noir, Spiderham and Pennie Parker were really entertaining with the screen time they were on though sometimes they felt have much variety sometimes compared too Spider Gwen,Peter Parket or Miles Morales.The action is pretty good as well and its done well with the comic book style animation as words or phrases would pop up on the screen like a comic book so that was fun and the comedy was really well timed and hasn't forced unlike the MCU movies it balanced the drama and humor aspect well in the movie.<br/><br/>However my biggest gripe about the movie is that some character arcs weren't would fully resolved or plot holes per say especially for Miles Morales' Dad and his Uncle I cant go into details without spoiling but there was an issue that happened that semed it was forgotten about and never fully solved. Also just minor nitpicks is that you dont get to see Miles Morales be Spiderman for really long or really show off what he can do but I understand its an origin story so its understandable and sometimes the movie wanted to do some fourth wall breaking like Deadpool but only in minor moments which felt kind of out of place.<br/><br/>So in the end there was very little wrong with this movie, I enjoyed almost every bit of it. It was funny, fun,colorful with really good animation,bold art style, amazing characters, blanced humor,great lessons about responsibility and courage and the drama was really well and was just an overall great movie. So again Well done Sony for making one of the best Spiderman movies ever and one of the best films of 2018."
"DJMonkeyZ","Null","4","8","24 December 2018"," One of the best animated film's of the decade
","Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse is the first theatrical animated Spider-Man movie and has lots to offer to Spidey fans, it's irreverent, innovative, charming, uniquely animated and contains a brand new interesting Spidey story that unfolds nicely. Instead of having Peter Parker be the lead, Miles Morales makes his big screen debut which is both funny and emotional and intriguing. This is basically Miles' movie. Due to the fast paced and well written story, we are transported into his universe that tells a Spider-Man origin story unlike any other. Miles is a very investing character due to his relationships, personality and because of the amount of layers his character has, he contains powers that the other Spider-People do not therefore he is a very tantalizing character for the audience, presenting us with a different kind of hero; this film shows us that a Spider-Man movie can work without Peter Parker in the main role. Miles' origin is actually more relatable and engaging than most superheroes and withstands fantastic character development because of the amount of layers his character contains.<br/><br/>That said, the other Spider-People are just as fun as Miles, who all have their own special abilities that are exciting and fresh. The standout supporting hero here is Spider-Ham, giving us a more humorous and irreverent character which is always a joy on screen especially when he is oblivious to his surroundings in this new dimension. However, Spider-Noir is a welcome addition to the cast but deserved a more in depth arc so a movie dedicated to his character would actually be a great idea. Additionally, Peter Parker finally gets the cinematic story he deserves as it explores Peter's adulthood and the struggles and responsibilitys that come with it. But apart from our heroes, there are a lot more juicy things here to easily titillate. The animation is extremely fresh and is a unique style that has never been tried before and really shows off the fact that it's essentially a comic book that has come to life. It provides a fantastic blend of CGi, cartoonish visuals, and anime.<br/><br/>Also, there are bundle loads of Easter Eggs including call backs to the original films, a small cameo by the late Cliff Robertson and the original 60's comics which sometimes help navigate Miles' responsibilities as Spider-Man and what he can do with his newfound capabilities, this concept will please all Spidey fans including myself. Like I previously broached, this movie isn't afraid to poke fun at Raimi's trilogy, the original comics and shows and that is what makes this film standout from the rest and I mean that in the best way possible as it makes out for fan based fun. Other things worth noting is the voice work as it is extremely well said and each voice actor suits there character with Shameik Moore providing an exceptionally good vocal performance as Miles, and the humour which is witty and slick and the laugh out loud jokes are frequent and doesn't take away the tonal consistency and there are a few emotional scenes in the film and the dialogue between some characters pulls on the heart-strings as well as some surprising plot twists. Forbye, the Prowler was absolutely amazing in this film and his light motif gave me chills and actually scared. Kingpin was a great lead villain as well.<br/><br/>Finally, the action sequences soar and bounce off the screen and are intense as well as visually stunning and the costume design is, well, awesome. However, I would of liked more screen time with the supporting heroes e.g. Spider-Ham, Spider-Noir, Spider-Gwen and Peni Parker as well as a better resolution for our heroes. But overall, 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse' will seem like Christmas for the long-term Spider-Man fans. It tells a perfect and innovative Spider-Man story which includes a strong lead hero and an unique style of animation with terrific supporting heroes. This new comic book film is essentially the don't miss movie this winter and exceeded my expectations. Sony has finally proven that they are capable of producing a near perfect Spidey feature which is a breath of fresh air, considering the fact that Spider-Man is a character who has been rebooted several times onto the big screen. A spinoff and a sequel are in the works and I'm not going to shy away from the fact that I'm excited for them, especially after the result of this film and remember stay to the end for a killer post credits scene.<br/><br/>Stan Lee would of been very proud. His envisions of the fact that anybody can be Spider-Man has been accomplished on screen. Rest in peace, the legend that is Stan The Man."

"ravi2445","1","35","122","1 January 2019"," Walked out of the theater....
","Weird story...even for a cartoon story with a lot of poetic licence. Story line JUST does not make sense. On top of that, psychedelic lights/pictures, and loud disconcerting music jumps out at you every few minutes. After a few minutes, I was worried that the rest of the movie would continue to suck, and was hoping for a reprieve...however that never came. After looking every which way to justify sitting in the theater, I could not - and walked out for the last bit. I think the wisdom of the public (97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, as of Dec 31, 2018) has failed for this movie - this movie really, really SUCKS. I guess this is what results after the studios have squeezed out the story every which way to commercialize it....."
"mmmn_mdhansen","6","6","14","29 January 2019"," Good Spiderman movie. Terrible 2-D animation. WAY overrated.
","I honestly don't understand the hype. The movie was fine. My kids enjoyed it about as much as I did (I'm 35, they're 6, and we all love superhero movies). I really enjoyed the movie at times, and was bored at other times. The comedy was great and the plot was original/decent. For the first 30 minutes of the movie, I thought we were being shown the 3-D version. I looked around to see if people had the glasses on. The random guy next to me was doing the same, and he left to get glasses for him and his kids. He let me try them to prove to me that the animation was not in 3-D, but rather was just bad animation.<br/><br/>Here are my guesses for why the ratings are so high:
1) Only really big fans of Spiderman, comic books, and/or cartoons have seen this movie, so the scores haven't been evened out by the average moviegoer.
2) Many reviewers saw it in 3-D, and the animation looks like it was designed solely for 3-D. If I felt like wasting my money, maybe I would've enjoyed it more.
3) Critics are mostly nerds, and the nerdy critics are the only ones who watched this. They're probably all the same critics who love the CW superhero shows.
4)<br/><br/>I don't see how this is higher than a 7.5 on iMDB, and 50% on Rotten Tomatoes."

It's really little, because you will fall aslept in 5 minutes.<br/><br/>-If you are between 11 and 16 you will love the movie. Tons of action, lights, plot twists and that kind of useless things that impress a teenager.<br/><br/>-If you are over 17, you will press the ""stop"" button in 15 minutes max.<br/><br/>I'm 44, so I'm gonna say it's the worst movie I've seen this year (and the whole last year too) so far.

You will go through the ranges of emotions with this one; it is that good. Not what I expected at all."
"namashi_1","10","5","11","27 December 2018"," Blockbuster Entertainment!
","Spider-Man movies have been really good. The ones helmed by Sam Raimi were particularly impressive, as those films focused on the idea of the boy beneath the mask, Peter Parker. The ""Amazing Spider-Man"" movies seemed lazy and hence 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse', being an animation tale, seems to be a risk.<br/><br/>But let me tell you, 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is nothing less than Blockbuster Entertainment! Yes, this is the Ideal Christmas film, that is high on action, emotion and comedy. And of course...soul! I don't remember having so much fun at a Superhero film since Black Panther!<br/><br/>'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' Synopsis: Miles Morales becomes the Spider-Man of his reality and crosses paths with his counterparts from other dimensions to stop a threat to all reality.<br/><br/>'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a joyride from the word go. Miles is an interesting protagonist with his own demons and powers that he comes to realize, but this film brims in Magic and brings in too many Spidey's from other dimensions to offer us a blockbuster in its truest sense. I won't give away much spoilers, but this is a film, that deserves to be viewed with your entire family. Its got the bite!<br/><br/>Phil Lord & Rodney Rothman's Screenplay is superb all through. Running high on energy while also focusing on soul and substance, this Animation film never runs out of breath. While the action is simply amazing, the emotional connect among its primary characters is what really stands out. Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman's Direction is excellent, as the animation gets enough scope to leave your eyes fun-filled. A special mention for Daniel Pemberton's Score and Robert Fisher Jr.'s Editing.<br/><br/>The Vocal Performances are top-notch all across the board. Shameik Moore as Miles Morales / Spider-Man hits all the right notes, giving us a hero who must explore his own voice. Jake Johnson as Peter B. Parker / Spider-Man is absolutely fantastic. Nicolas Cage as Peter Parker / Spider-Man Noir does a remarkable job and seems to be having a ball. Kathryn Hahn as Olivia ""Liv"" Octavius / Doctor Octopus and Liev Schreiber as Wilson Fisk / The Kingpin, voice the menaces to perfection.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a winner all the way. It's a blockbuster that has heart and soul. What else could you ask for?"
"joey_corner","10","5","11","27 December 2018"," Honestly not only the best animated film I've ever seen but also THE BEST FILM I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE PERIOD!

"Animany94","9","5","11","19 December 2018"," This was a wonderful surprise!
","I admit it, I was a little sceptical about this movie knowing the history and reputation of Sony Animation and after I watched their live-action departent butcher the character of Venom in theaters earlier this year.<br/><br/>But this was a stunning expirience! The company that gave us garbage like The Emoji Movie actually cared this time and stepped up their game.<br/><br/>First of all, the animation was fantastic with lots of vibrant colours and an overall comic book feel to it unfolding when Miles Morales is discovering his new identity as his dimension's Spider-Man. Your eyes will be glued to the screen when this riot of animation gets going.<br/><br/>We also get a well paced coming-of-age story of Miles Morales which is filled with lots of real-life struggles which makes him so relatable just like Spider-Man is supposed to be. I was so happy seeing a portrayal of him which understood his comic book character. The writers definitely knew about certain misinterpretations in the past.<br/><br/>Even though not every character has a ton of development put into them, they still manage to make them work to serve the story. They get to tell a brief origin story just to make clear to non-Spider-Man viewers who we're dealing with. And the Spider-Man team is just so loveable and make great dynamics off of each other while they still keep both feet on the ground knowing how serious the situation is.<br/><br/>And wait for the climax which is super intense and showcases animation's full potential in creating art and entertainment.<br/><br/>A good coming-of-age story with amazing animation and intense action scenes that will blow your mind!"

"ebok007","9","30","103","6 December 2018"," A Fresh Take
","With a very likable new hero, style oozing from every frame, and a comic book weirdness that might only work in animation, Into the Spider-Verse is a fresh take on the Spider-Man franchise that is very welcome. Heavy on humor, action, heart, a pack of both heroes and villains... there are a lot of moving pieces here that very easily could've not worked. I'm glad to say that it all comes together in the end for a very enjoyable adventure. You can feel the Lord/Miller voice with some of the meta humor similar to The LEGO Movie, but it is definitely doing its own thing and really felt cohesive/unique. If you think you are interested in this movie, I'm fairly certain you will enjoy it."

","Saw this today thanks to AMC's A-List. It was truly awful. I fell asleep and when I woke up, Miles formed some sort of Spiderman team with some Japanese girl in a suit, Spiderman Noir(?), Spider Pig, who I actually remembered from the nineties and some other characters. This was just absolutely weird. This movie was just all over the place, I don't think Marvel could possibly have had anything to do with this mess unlike Spiderman Homecoming. I'm at a loss as to why Sony has problems making a decent Spiderman/Venom movie. Yes, I know Venom did well, but let's be honest, people only went because Homecoming was so good, so they thought Venom would be as well. They didn't know Marvel wasn't allowed to have any say on that film though, sadly.<br/><br/>Thanks for wasting 2 hours of my time. Don't waste yours."
"jason-tatman","1","91","362","16 December 2018"," Terrible - absolutely TERRIBLE
","This movie was absolutely awful. The animation blurs every time a character moves. It hurt my eyes it was so bad. The characters were annoying, and it's full of God awful cringe throughout. People have been so completely dumbed down in recent years by the absolute TRASH Hollywood splats out to screens. It's very depressing to see how many people are so accepting of something this caliber. It ticks every cliched box of every comic book movie that comes out anymore. Especially the eye rolling, idiotic one liners constantly spit out, and the extreme political correctness that constantly litters every screen around the globe now-a-days. Basically, it's the same comic book movie you've seen over and over and over again, but animated in a terrible way. Just being honest."
"nimdude","9","12","35","13 December 2018"," Absolutely everything one would want from an animated Spider-Man movie
","This one is a complete home run. I'm pretty sure that the praise for this movie will be positively one-sided and for very good reason.<br/><br/>Quickly touching on the negative . Like there's only two things I didn't like about this movie. The first is the narrative cliche's found in every super hero movie ever so its not a big fault but it happens and it annoys me but only ever so slightly. The second is when a character learns a particular skill set just by deciding he wants to be good at it, its an unconvincing way to further the story and a pretty lazy one.<br/><br/>But all that is only about 5% of the whole movie. The rest is an absolute overload of the senses in a very very good way.<br/><br/>I don't want to mention the characters in this movie because some of them might surprise you so all of them worked and all of them were fantastic.<br/><br/>The movie is crazy funny, and its funny in a way that is actually refreshing in modern blockbusters. Its funny without being political. CONGRATULATIONS you didn't make any politically charged jokes that are one sided in a big budget Sony movie. I hope this new trend continues where jokes aren't politicized in movies.<br/><br/>The voice acting is spot on from everyone, don't want to mention names as some might be a surprise.<br/><br/>I find the story to be almost on par with everyones favorite Spider-Man stories (Rami) in terms of quality, mainly because all the central themes and character morality are there in the story. Power, responsibility and all that jazz. It isn't empty like in the Amazing Spider-Man .<br/><br/>The thing that surprised me most about this movie (aside from how genuinely funny it is) is how much emotion there is at it's core. Family, friends and sacrifice are a huge undertone of the movies core message.<br/><br/>The main thing I took away from the film is the visuals. Holy every god ever this movie is gorgeous as hell. The most gorgeous in recent memory, and certainly my personal favorite visuals in an animated movie ever.<br/><br/>9.3/10"

"ernestsavesxmas","9","2","3","20 November 2019"," Perfect balance of humor and sincerity
","Sometimes movies live up to the hype. And sometimes kids movies are still kids movies. Both of these things can be true at once and 'Into the Spider-Verse' certainly proves it. I spend a lot of time, far more time than is necessary, thinking about how films that fall into the ""kids movie"" genre need to be judged on a different scale. They're not for me (us). They're for my (our) kids. If the kid says ""turn it off"" then it has failed, regardless if I'm enjoying it, or tolerating it, or hating it, or none of the above: It has failed completely.<br/><br/>My almost-5-year-old loved this. And so did I. It's clever and original in ways, all of the ways, these movies just never are anymore. The humor is tight and never overstays its welcome and the sincerity is onpoint and effective.

","They took a lot of risks with this movie and I think it was definitely worth it.<br/><br/>So yes, this movie looks great. Through the movie I could not stop thinking about just how good it looks. Animation was done with a lot of passion and thought put into it. This movies strongest suit is it's animation, and it uses it. I've never seen taking advantage of the animation to it's potential like in this movie. There was no better way to tell this story than it was told. It really feels like watching a comic book come to life.<br/><br/>But the story was also unexpectedly good. The story itself is probably 7-8, but it gets elevated by the animation, music, and humor. It was actually funny, and lately I couldn't find myself laughing at the humor in newer movies. There were a few jokes that didn't sit right with me, and I found the Spider-Ham unnecessary, although kids might find it funny, but most of it was really good. The music also drew me in the story and highlighted emotional scenes. But everything wasn't perfect. For instance the final battle was too long, there were some cliches, and I don't understand where does invisibility come from.<br/><br/>I would probably give it an 8, but I want to encourage taking risks and using animation the way this movie does. I've never seen anything like it."

I laughed out loud at some of his comments. I also enjoyed seeing kingpin has a main villian and the prowler was also well done. All in all this is a very entertaining movie. If I have to include a negative I didn't like the character of aunt may. Also it was nice to see a Stan Lee camio and a nice special mention to him at the end of the film. Well done Sony"

","What a superb Movie.<br/><br/>In coming into this movie I was blank. I know much about Spiderman but I don't know enough. Not sure if any of this movie is accurate or not although this movie was really good.<br/><br/>This movie is about Miles becoming a new Spiderman, adapting to his ability and trying to get the other Spidermen back to their universes.<br/><br/>The animation was only a problem at the beginning for like 30 second then i got use to it.<br/><br/>A few popular spiderman villains show up. The main Lead Villain is none other than the Kingpin who is basically trying to do what Cable did in Deadpool 2 movie but he is more sinister because the movie portrays him like such. He was able to over power 3 spider mans while giant Green Goblin struggled.<br/><br/>Pacing in this movie was great, time went by fast because it was such a great film.<br/><br/>We got to see various spiderman's from other universes. 2 Of which I think were forced in my opinion.<br/><br/>The scene where Miles find out about the Prowler is probably the best scene in the movie.<br/><br/>To conclude great movie.

","Heard all the great reviews on this, got excited to see it, and was majorly disappointed. The animation was different and I can certainly appreciate how it reminded me of stop-motion (it is also super colorful), but it gets blurry and weird at times, and I'm not exactly sure what this accomplishes.<br/><br/>I am glad to see King Pin as the villain, and I'll be honest I'm not totally up to date with the Miles Morales story arc, but none of that is what made the film disappointing. As already mentioned, the animation is overhyped (colors are pretty and some sequences are well made), but if we are honestly talking about best animation ever... there are at least half a dozen movies made in the last decade that would surpass this IMO (Kubo and the Two Strings probably being the best).<br/><br/>Then, the story falls flat and I never felt like there was anything at stake. The universe gets mixed up and Miles is just trying to find his courage in being a hero. Nothing ever feels dire. Most of the comedy falls flat except for some good jokes being made at passed Spider-Man movies and Peter Parker. Far from the best animation ever as most are dubbing it and also far from being awful. I'll probably be one of the few reviews that sits middle of the road."
"metztex","7","1","1","31 December 2019"," Surprising and Entraining
","Bottom Line Up Front...If you like comic book based films, you are likely to enjoy this one. Plot is different, not cookie cutter. Voices are well chosen and the pace of the films is about right after an initial slow start.<br/><br/>I usually don't like films that use this type of animation but in this case, it works. The plot is different which helps tremendously and the occasional use of ""pure comic book"" animation brings some nostalgia to the film. At times I felt I was watching the old Adam West Batman show but with A LOT less ""cheese"".<br/><br/>The use of a different villain was also nice for this installment of Spider man. The diversity of the spider""people"" was also well balanced and was the use of each spider""person's"" special ability.<br/><br/>This film surprised me.

The animation is probably even better, with small details here and there that add to the characters and what they represent, speaking of small details, Brooklyn is beautiful in comparison to the cities of other modern animated movies and it genuinely looks lived in. Also, I MUST mention the sound design, I mean, they used spray-cans in Mile's theme! Every Spider-Man (or woman) character gets their own theme that sounds different from one another but also quite similar.

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","12","36","13 December 2018"," The Best Spider-Man Movie Ever Made: and Sony's All-Time Best Animation!
","***(Spoilers Ahead)***<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is so much better than anyone expected it to be: it's the kind of film people don't realize they want so badly, and when it comes, it's a breath of fresh creative air. This film's the best kind of crazy: alternate dimensions, cartoony-drama (family issues and dying mentors) mixed with humour (cartoon pigs, film-noir cliches and Japanese mechas), culturally remixing Spider-Man into a living and breathing idea; anyone can be him, and what makes them different defines their own Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is still one of my all-time favourite characters: he's tied with Batman and Superman as far as I'm concerned, and it was high time that Spider-Man got his own theatrically released animated feature. Spider-Verse honours the character and then some with its wholly unique animation style, its star-studded voice-actors and the whole thing feeling like the sort of thing Stan Lee would have wanted to see on the big screen. Stan unfortunately passed away before the film's release, so hopefully he got to see an early screener copy of the film. Who knows? It sucks that he's gone now; but his creations (his brain children) live on through the endless stream that is modern pop-culture. This movie's definitely a zeitgeist piece for Spider-Man: a self-aware love-letter to a character whom both comic and non-comic fans know and love openly.<br/><br/>This film delves into the origin story of Miles Morales: and how he became Spider-Man after Peter Parker is killed by Wilson Fisk (The Kingpin). We see Miles' dilemma of being himself play throughout the movie, and when the Spider-Men from the multiverse come into his reality, they help overcome his deep-inhibitions. This movie doesn't gloss over the dramatic stuff easily (Kingpin's family die in a car-crash) and it somehow manages to balance out the humour with the serious stuff ridiculously well (Spider-Ham and Spider-Gwen compliment the comedy-drama duality of the film). Spider-Verse is the comic book movie people have wanted since Frank Miller's Sin City: it's got that same to-the-T comic-book styling to it; and I don't say that lightly at all. It's something amazing to behold on the big screen.<br/><br/>If only animated cinema in general could acknowledge that it's okay to be as aesthetically liberal with animation as people can (and do) go with live-action cinema through endless variations of stories, genres, styles and motifs. I think movies like Spider-Verse show that Disney's animated fairy-tales (while still being very enjoyable) don't represent what animation CAN be like Japanese animation does, but films like Into The Spider-Verse represent what animation inevitably WILL be: a varied landscape as diversified as any medium in life can possibly get. The 2010s have been a rather progressive time for American animation and I'm more than happy to see Hollywood tackle things outside the 'Disney fairy-tale comfort zone'.<br/><br/>I loved every second of this movie and I'm stoked for the sequels and spin-offs! This movie was a SUPER-BLAST!<br/><br/>P.S. Stan Lee, Steve Ditko: you both made the world a happier place to be thanks to your genius creation."

"themadmovieman","9","23","83","6 December 2018"," Spellbinding
","This is a genuinely exceptional film. Away from the world of the big-budget, mainstream comic book movies, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse breaks boundaries with a stunningly original and fresh take on the classic superhero tale, combining hilarious self-referential humour with an equally thrilling story, all topped off with spellbinding visuals from beginning to end.<br/><br/>There's nowhere we can start from but the film's stunning animation. With clear love and passion for all things superhero poured into every single frame of Into The Spider-Verse, the film sings with its mesmerising comic-book style visuals, bordering on the edge of a kind of gritty stop-motion that blends seamlessly with individual panels, captions and even the odd THWACK or BIFF that pops up on the screen.<br/><br/>But not only does this film bring comic books to life on the big screen like never before, because it also has a stunning and vivid urban vibe throughout that adds to the atmosphere and excitement of the whole affair. Again blurring the lines between gritty urban visuals and psychedelic, kaleidoscopic colours, the film is a dazzling watch, with cinematography that pops in hugely entertaining fashion throughout, adding to the jaw-droppingly good-looking nature of the film, all the while furthering its unique and distinct atmosphere.<br/><br/>And that's the next thing I want to touch on, because although Into The Spider-Verse does centre on a big Marvel character, what makes it feel so fresh is that unique atmosphere. Of course, the visuals are integral in that, but there's something deeper that comes from the film's brilliant screenplay and passionate directing. Landing us in a parallel version of New York City, the movie has the opportunity to play with things we know and love, and give them an original twist to help set the foundations of this world apart from the mainstream comic book movies.<br/><br/>As a result, this film completely breaks the rule book when it comes to modern superhero movies - surpassing even the likes of Deadpool with its originality - with a gleefully fun and playful take on comic book tropes and clichés, all the while still surging with an immensely exciting blockbuster plot that feels pleasantly familiar, but just different enough.<br/><br/>So that means that you can enjoy Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse in a number of different ways, whether it be as a straight comic book blockbuster akin to the MCU and DCEU, a fresh and exciting urban thriller, a visual masterpiece filled with a kaleidoscope of colours, or even a flat-out hilarious comedy. There are few movies in the genre with that degree of diversity within, but it's that very fact that makes it such a stunning watch throughout, leaving you barely a minute to breathe as it enthralls you from every single angle.<br/><br/>Finally, a mention about the film's comedy, which is absolutely amazing from beginning to end. It's a laugh-a-minute rollercoaster of a movie, with both well-written and character-driven humour throughout, as well as fantastically tongue-in-cheek, self-referential humour, doing for Spider-Man what Warner Bros.' hilarious The Lego Batman Movie did for the Caped Crusader, and a whole lot of winks and nods to modern superhero movies that are sure to have fans laughing on a near-constant basis.<br/><br/>Overall, then, I was blown away by Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse. For a film that seems so small at first, it's actually one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen, breaking out on its own in brilliantly unique fashion with an absolutely mesmerising visual template, a thoroughly exciting and original story, a passionate and tangible urban atmosphere, and utterly hilarious comedy from start to finish."
"Uberiffic","Null","22","79","22 December 2018"," Awful Pandering ... Terrible Movie, Period.
","This poorly constructed CARTOON does nothing but reinforce the stereotype that comic books are a childish medium. It also helps exemplify a lot of what is wrong with modern Marvel itself.<br/><br/>Juvenile virtue signaling and forced unnecessary diversity is placed above what made the source material great in the first place. It tries to drive home both points to nauseating levels (literally because the choppy animation was designed to induce seizures and appeal to ADD sufferers) Between the ""bip and baps"" reminiscent of Adam West's Batman was a story that featured minority Spidey becoming near invincible because his father gives him a speech through a door. And don't forget infallible Mary Sue Spider-Gwen who is automatically better than all the boys because you know...vagina!!!<br/><br/>That aside, the story and characters themselves were apparently written by twelve year olds to appeal to twelve year olds. Spider-Pigs, anime robots and Alfred-like emotionless Aunt May surrounded by ruined classic Marvel villains (horrid distorted representations of Scorpion, Doc Ock, Kingpin, etc) Yes, they leaned on the misrepresentation from the Ultimate line but that garbage failed in print for a reason. Why puke that in to animation?<br/><br/>Overall, it's easy to see why older fans are rejecting this thing and why the box office was so light. Thank God for that anyway. Here's hoping this nonsense stays out of the MCU."

We also got the newest trend in Hollywood: female Doc Ock, Gwen's hair and Miles with his soy smile. It kind of feels refreshing here and there, some individual aspects work, but overall this flick makes me want to never rewatch it."

","This will be short, as I have never written a review, before.
I have been a Spider-Man fan since I was little, watching the original 1967 series, reading the comics, etc.
This movie was 100% in the vein of Stan and Steve's vision. After all, what made Spider-Man the most popular superhero of all time, was it's relatability. The heart of the character is summed up in Uncle Ben's immortal words, ""With great power, comes great responsibility."" This is as true today, as it was over fifty years ago, and this movie completely embraces and expands on this concept.
And the cameo with Stan actually made me tear up, given how recent his departure was. He and Steve would be so very proud of this movie!
Excelsior!"

It is a good movie that one might enjoy, but the animation is not great, and the voices are not great. I have seen many animated films, and there is an unnerving aspect to this. I would say that there is something missing, that is hard to describe. Perhaps it is the description of the characters, or the pace of the story, but this film did not feel right to me.

"nubet","2","3","6","9 December 2019"," Headache inducing, terrible soundtrack, mediocre story.
","I am absolutely shocked at the massively high rating and hype surrounding this movie. I'm afraid it's a victim of Black Panther syndrome, which judges a motion picture on inclusivity rather than actual quality. This is also reflected pretty obviously in the soundtrack which is obnoxious hip hop, which is of course just my opinion.<br/><br/>This movie had some good moments and some funny moments, but overall, it's a below average animation for children. A lot of people are praising the art style, but personally it actually strained my eyes after 30 minutes, and I'm only in my twenties. The low frame rate and sometimes just bad picure quality make me feel like I'm watching a bad video game cutscene.<br/><br/>The voice acting is solid all around and probably the saving grace if there is one. The story is nothing special. It hits the cliche tropes and passes on logic for over the top situations/powers/details which aren't explained. This further points to a young target audience.<br/><br/>I would say I could never understand why this movie has such a high rating, but we all know why. I wish people would rate movies based on their merit alone and not the political virtues that are implied. Mediocre at best."
"andrewroy-04316","6","3","6","6 April 2019"," For such an inventive premise and excellent animation, questionable plot choices are made and the themes and arc are surprisingly formulaic
","I think this one is mostly ""on me"", as someone who never read comic books growing up and enjoys the ideas that movies leave me with, not the visual experience as much. Spider-Verse is undeniably creative and unique, particularly in its animation, which I think is the best I've ever seen, and the premise is a self-aware and original breath of fresh air in the superhero genre. The voice acting is good, and the comedy is pretty good (though I found the jokes revolving around Miles being young and being goofy in learning his powers to be trite and overplayed). While I was ready to love it, many plot points left me scratching my head and there was no sense of any real stakes. Among the frustrating plot points to me were the absurdity of the 3 new spider people, especially Porky (why? How does that make any sense?); the uncle coincidentally being the person working for Kingpin and tasked with chasing down Spider-Man; Kingpin's backstory scene, where we are following Miles escaping and out of nowhere cut to a memory of Kingpin's family dying after having no background on him at all, just felt very out of place and poorly edited; and other minor points. The story was quite predictable and followed a rote story arc, which contributed significantly to the sense that the outcome was never in doubt, keeping my emotional investment and engagement low throughout. In classic deus ex machina form, Miles struggled and gradually is improving in using his powers, and then right after his dad talks to him he magically has complete control and can win all the fights, is a beast out of nowhere? It had done such a good job of showing his struggles in being valued and succeeding in his tasks, so the flipped switch of him effortlessly and suddenly being powerful was a disservice to the rest of the movie. Thematically, it didn't feel like anything unique, as a standard coming of age story and with a message that anyone can be a superhero. It pays obvious and honest homage to the comic book form, more genuinely adapting the style than any movie I've seen before. It did many things really well, but the various plot point frustrations and the lack of emotional investment due to the lack of stakes made it a forgettable, if pleasant, movie experience for me. I certainly recommend it to others, as at minimum you'll get a fun, amusing and visually gorgeous movie and if you like the comic book style, it could be an all time great."

"rouzaudhelene","9","3","6","20 February 2019"," Animation's bright future
","Entering the theatre, I didn't really know what to expect of this movie. Spiderman is arguably my favourite super hero, but since I didn't watch any trailer or teaser for the film, I went to see it without any prejudice, other than the fact that I somehow knew it would be really good.<br/><br/>The movie follows the story of Miles Morales, a brilliant black high-schooler, who, as he was out tagging a wall with his uncle, got bitten by a very, very special spider. In a world where Spiderman is famous and thriving, he has to learn to live with his confusing new abilities. One day, he meets Peter Parker, the actual « Friendly neighbourhood Spiderman » when the latter is fighting super villains. He senses that Miles has the same powers as him, and assures the young boy that he will teach him the ways of becoming a super hero. Later, still fighting the villain, Peter dies, and asks Miles to finish his mission for him. This mission includes stopping Wilson Fisk from opening numerous alternate dimensions and creating a black hole. Teaming up with other Spider-heroes, who got stuck in Miles' dimension due to Fisk's creation, the group will learn to come to a compromise and work together to stop the worse from happening.<br/><br/>The whole movie was beautiful. The animation is based on a mix of 2D and 3D animation, and made in the style of 70's comics. It results in beautiful, dynamic sequences. The bright colours make everything feel lively, and even thrilling to watch.
I have two scenes that I particularly cherish. The first one is the 'leap of faith' one, when Miles finally accepts and controls his powers, climbs on top of a building and then jumps (or as is said in the movie, he takes a leap of faith). Everything in this sequence is breathtaking, from the view of the city that seems to blur with the apprehension of the hero, to the music, which sounds kind of distant and slow, and recreates here too the sensation of stress and excitement. The tension builds up, and is then released, when Miles jumps and with him, everything accelerates in a way that yells ''He made it!''
The second one is during the final fight, when the villain's machine is creating a black hole, and Miles has to fight Fisk in order to stop it. The two opponents are wearing black, which highly contrasts with the very colourful and unstable background of the scene. There again, the camera work is very smart and makes the scene a true eye candy.<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed the movie. I went to see it twice, and would gladly go to see it again and again! The story it shares is the one of growing up and becoming adult, and the responsibilities that comes with it. But it's more than that : it's also the story of a young, mixed-race man, who becomes a hero. It is something that is still not much seen these days, and many young black people were truly empowered after seeing Miles. This point is not something one can overlook.
I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone liking action but also light-hearted movies, with witty jokes and great characters.<br/><br/>When I think of movies comparable to Spiderman : Into the Spiderverse, Coco comes to my mind.

","Absolutely incredible. Call me a sucker for cell shading, but I think the art direction, along with the music, was visually stunning. The story was... typical of Spider-Man. Honestly though, it didn't deter the movie from being engaging, funny, sad, and creative in it's own sense.<br/><br/>I love the different approach the movie took on Spider-Man's villains. Until now, I always thought Spidey's villains were boring. The slightly reimagined villains were refreshing to say the least.<br/><br/>While DC's animated movies have always been great. Marvel animated movies, on the other hand, have never been good. Into the Spider-Verse is, without a doubt, the best Spider Man, the best animated, and one of the best Marvel movies I've watched to date.<br/><br/>It's a must watch for any comic book/superhero fan."

","""True, a lot of animation is insipid, and insulting even to the children it is made for. But great animation can make the mind sing.""<br/><br/><ul><li>Excerpt from Roger Ebert's review for Princess Mononoke (1998)</li></ul><br/><br/>Such is true for, of all things, a silly Spider-man film.<br/><br/>The story follows a very relatable Miles Morales as our soon to be new Spider-Man and his struggles with school, family, and his own self-inadequacies. Miles is bitten by a radioactive spider from another universe caused by a science machine used by the villain Kingpin for his own personal reasons.<br/><br/>The use of the machine causes several different versions of Spider-Man/Woman/Pig to end up in the same universe. All the different Spider-people need to make it back to their respective universe while simultaneously stopping Kingpin from inadvertently destroying the multi-verse.<br/><br/>Pretty standard comic book stuff. However, the opportunity taken to present this basic premise with such flair helps it to easily rise above it's peers.<br/><br/>I felt true ecstasy while viewing this film. I saw a canvas that almost could not contain all the creativity that threatened to spill from the screen onto the audience.<br/><br/>The joy of taking every opportunity to build the film into an explosion of style, colour, and entertainment is felt throughout the entire runtime. I love that the silhouette rule was paid attention to. While there are 6 different versions of Spider-Man in the film, you could easily distinguish one from another if you only saw their silhouette.<br/><br/>Even all of the villains (outside of Kingpin) that appear in the film are different interpretations of those characters.<br/><br/>While the film shows love, or at least winks and nods to the various incarnations and interpretations of Spider-Man through the decades it's really not required knowledge for those who are less familiar with the character.<br/><br/>The themes are kept simple (rightfully so), but they feel genuine and are wonderfully woven and executed throughout the entire narrative rather than tagged on impotently at the end.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this film enough, it's fresh and full of passion and joy. So much so that I felt something after watching it, and I hope you do too."
"aheen-94576","10","3","6","9 January 2019"," What did I just watch!
","It's epic in one word. It is something, nobody has ever seen in cinema. The story revolves around Miles Morales, a kid from Brooklyn. Kingpin creates a collider which opens portal for parallel universes. Miles and other spidys team up to resolve the abnormality.
The movie is so well made that there is literally no dull moment. The visuals are splendid. It felt like you are going through a great comic book and it is your imaginative world. The travellers from other universes pursued great character depth. The movie seems so comically realistic that you will be familiar with the laws of the cinematic-verse within the first half. The first half of the movie was too good. Then second half did justice to the first half. It is a never seen before experience.<br/><br/>Surely a must watch."
"WooderIce64","10","3","6","9 January 2019"," Best Spider-Man Movie.
","Sony Pictures Animation has had its ups and downs. It had critical and financial success with Hotel Transylvania but stooped as low as the Emoji Movie in 2017. However, they bounced back the following year with Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which is undoubtedly their best movie, and one of the best animated movies of the decade. While Sony has made 5 Spider-Man movies since 2002 (not counting the Venom spin-off), this is the first one to not focus on Peter Parker, but rather on Miles Morales. Miles is hesitant to take on the superhero life due to his school life and his cop father's disapproval of Spider-Man in general but is encouraged after witnessing the death of Peter Parker. While that sounds like a major spoiler, it happens 20 minutes into the movie. He spends the movie learning what it means to be Spider-Man, and how much harder it is than it seems. Miles' arc is handled very well, and he develops well from not wanting to have his powers at all to embracing his new role as Spider-Man.<br/><br/>There are a whole host of Spider-People, as one may infer. There's Miles Morales, Peter B. Parker, Gwen Stacy (Spider-Woman), Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham. Peter B. Parker is the middle-aged, washed up Spider-Man, who serves as a mentor for Miles. Gwen Stacy appears as Spider-Woman, who meets Miles early on and is the first to join him and Peter. Spider-Man Noir, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham are mostly comic relief, but they're great at that. There are a whole host of villains, but they mostly aren't that notable. The main villain is Kingpin, whose motives aren't interesting. It's the same thing as Kaecilius from Doctor Strange in 2016. Prowler is actually a very interesting character, and the twist involving him was done very well. Doc Ock (who in this universe is Olivia Octavius) was a fine side-villain. The others (Green Goblin, Tombstone, Scorpion) don't really do much, but they awesome to watch, given the animation. If there's one thing to complain about with the characters, it's that Spider-Man 2099 doesn't have a role in the main film. But the existing cast of Spider-People are great characters, and it's great to get a proper Miles Morales movie.<br/><br/>The animation is absolutely spectacular. This is the closest thing we've ever gotten to a comic book movie in its truest form, meaning that the animation looks like it came right off the pages of a comic. There is nothing like this. From the character designs, to the beautiful flow of animation (especially in the fight scenes, which are mind-blowing), and above all, the text and onomatopoeias that appear on screen. It's one of those movies that's worth seeing in 3D. There is definitely a part of the animation that shows its setting. The soundtrack, which features a lot of rap music throughout fits in well with the visuals. Another great thing about this is how Noir, Peni, and Spider-Ham fit in, despite being done in their own distinctive style of animation. With Peni, for instance, she's an anime character, and the way she's animated follows a distinct anime style, but she never feels out of place. Same goes for Spider-Ham being like a Looney Tunes character. The movie is also well written, and has some excellent moments of humor, but knows when to take itself seriously. When it's funny, it's really funny.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is without a doubt the best Spider-Man movie ever made. As much as I have nostalgia for the Raimi trilogy, I must admit it's been bested. In addition, Spider-Verse is the best superhero of 2018, and one of the best superhero movies of all time. This is an absolute must watch for any fans of Spider-Man, Marvel, or comics in general. It's also worth noting that the movie ends with a touching tribute to Stan Lee, as this is the first Marvel movie since his passing. It's great to see him and Steve Ditko honored at the end."

","This movie was just amazing. To start off, the animation was absolutely phenomenal. It's animated in a way that makes you feel like you're standing inside a comic book. It was beautiful and awesome to look at. From the moment that the seizure-inducing logo played at the beginning, I knew we were in for a treat. It was the coolest animation style I've ever seen. The soundtrack was equally awesome, and I've been listening to it on repeat for the past few days. I was pleasantly shocked when I heard juice wrld's voice in the movie. I mean that's just cool. The soundtrack really built onto the movie and created such a unique vibe that you won't find in any other spiderman movie. Furthermore, the action, story, and pacing were all great as well. This movie is a thrill ride from start to finish, with some truly hilarious moments, some very serious/emotional/moving moments, some moments that are just plain awesome, and more. There are even a few legitimate jump scares. The action is visually awesome and not overdone or underdone. This movie keeps you on your toes and there is not a single part where you'll become bored. As for the characters, surprise, they are great too. Miles is an amazing protagonist, and while I went into the movie skeptical about a spiderman that wasn't peter parker, I went out a huge fan of miles morales. He's a very relatable and likable character, and he goes through a moving and meaningful arc throughout the film. His relationship with several mentors plays a key role in the movie, including with peter b parker. This different take on the character works very well. As for the rest, gwen is a badass (and kinda hot?), noir is hilarious, porker is pretty funny, and peni is kinda just there but still pretty cool. However, I'm not sure why there were so many villains in this movie. Kingpin was awesome (albeit a bit ridiculous in design) and the way he *spoiler* really shocked me. It was brutal. I understood his basic plan and his motivations but I wish we got just a bit more character development from him. Instead, we got a load of random side villains, who were all pretty cool but I just feel like 1 or 2 could have been eliminated to give more screentime to kingpin. Prowler was amazing though. He was extremely intimidating, had a great soundtrack and plays a key role in the movie as a whole. Of course this movie has a few other imperfections (1 or 2 jokes didnt land, there were a couple minor inconsistencies/plot holes, it could have been a tad longer) but no movie is completely perfect. As far as animated movies go, this is easily one of the best i've ever seen. It's also my favorite spiderman movie and one of my favorite superhero movies. Seriously, don't sleep on it just because it's animated. It is 100% worth the watch. Whoever made this movie clearly put immense effort into it and it shows. 9.6/10"

","In my opinion it's better than the Sam Raimi trilogy, better than both amazing spider-man films, better than homecoming and even better than the Japanese Spider-man show. It is also the best animated super hero film I've seen, but where I have seen every spider-man film and tv show, I haven't seen every animated super hero film so that might change.
What it is is pretty much what you would get if you made a film based on a mix of modern marvel and Stan Lee's original Spider-man run and then made it a whole lot better than you would expect from that description. The animation, voice acting and cinematography are amazing. While the story is kind of done before, that is mostly in comics and not as a film. Not all villains have gotten the time to develop, but honestly, somehow that makes them feel realer. I'm not 100% sure I'll still feel like this after my second watch, but right now it is really hard to decide between a 9 and a 10."

"mitchell5954","8","3","6","21 December 2018"," Easily One of My Favorite Spider-Man Movies
","Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse is the latest Spider-Man movie from Sony. I was somewhat wary of this film initially, because Sony's track record with Spider-Man films since Spider-Man 3 hasn't been too hot. Even Spider-Man Homecoming I can't say is that good, and that was done by Marvel Studios. I initially liked it when it came out, but it's only gotten worse over time. However, I'm pleased to say Into the Spider-Verse is the best Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2.<br/><br/>The story follows Miles Morales as he learns to adjust to his new school life and him getting spider powers after being bit, just like Peter Parker. However, soon Perter Parker/Spider-Man and other spider characters join up with Morales in order to stop the King Pin, the main villain of the story. Any more explaining would dive into spoilers.<br/><br/>Of all the Spider-Man films we've gotten over the years, this one is the most fun, in my opinion. This is mainly due to the fact it feels the most like a Spider-Man comic, which is no surprise as that is the point. The film's unique art and animation style, and the usage of comic mechanics, like thought boxes, makes the film feel like a comic come to life. It's a blend of several Spider-Man continuities each from the comics, some even I've never heard of before like Spider-Man Noir played by the awesome Nicolas Cage.<br/><br/>The way they explain each character's story is done in a way that will make diehard Spider-Man happy, while also appealing to more casual fans (like myself) or just casual moviegoers. It truly feels like a comic event story in movie form. There was an event in the comics called Spider-Verse by Dan Slott a couple years ago (which I haven't read) which this film most likely is somewhat based on.<br/><br/>The voice acting is good all around, though some voices took some getting used to. I didn't care for the voices of Peter Parker (both versions) at first but they grew on me. The action scenes are great; easily the best since the Raimi films. The music is also pretty good, especially the song that played when Miles Morales finally dawned his Spider-Man costume.<br/><br/>Overall, Into the Spider-Verse is one of the best Spider-Man movies to come out easily. In my opinion, the best Spider-Man film is still Spider-Man 2 (from a pure quality and nostalgic standpoint) but this is a close second. If you're at all a fan of spider-Man, or just fun action movies, then give this a watch for sure."

","Just saw an advanced screening of this film and the single best word to describe it is - cool. The animation and direction are highly stylized and, as a result, viewers will probably love it or hate it. You can place me solidly in the first camp.<br/><br/>Besides the general style of the film, the dialogue and voice acting are notable. The voice acting is some of the finest I've seen on film. There's not a single weak link in the cast. And the dialogue, as expected from a Phil Lord script, is clever and full of humor.

Well, cash grab should be another motivation, as Sony does not have much IP. Besides, the premise, or setting, of the film is unconvincing. Why would there be multiple universes?"
"stroggos","10","4","10","20 January 2019"," A bold vision of a new kind of cinema
","Only ever so often does a movie hit the big screen that feels genuinely new, like nothing that has been there before. ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is such a movie. This is perhaps the most successful fusion of film and comic book to date, made with love to both genres.<br/><br/>Of course, people rave about the movie's style and animation... and yes, ""Into the Spider-Verse"" is jaw-droppingly gorgeous. However, the amazing look and feel of the movie should not make us forget that Spider-Verse gets everything else right as well. This movie has soul! It's a deeply moving coming-of-age story with pitch-perfect screenplay and some great voice acting.<br/><br/>Let me also point out how bold ""Into the Spider-Verse"" is: Something as experimental and colorful could've easily failed on so many levels, but the creators stuck with their vision and made no compromises in style or story. This is to be rewarded!<br/><br/>All in all, ""Into the Spider-Verse"" is absolute masterclass and hands-down one of the best movies of 2018."

","I did not expect such a good movie going into another Spiderman Movie. But Marvel did a great Job showing us another Story out of their huge Comic Book Universe.
But seeing only 10 Reviews on this Page is a bit overrated. First of all the Animation is really mind-blowing and a completly new Style. This is incredible and i hope more movies risk something in this area. The Movie felt like reading an actual Comic Book which was surprsingly fun. The Soundtrack helped the Movie to create Emotions and felt cool because it fits in our Time. The Story was overall not bad, but nothing great happend. As i said earlier, it felt like a cinematic Comic Book and this also means that the Story was nothing more than this. Therefore it was a way better story than average with a lot of Humor and Action. but nothing that will be remembered long.
So Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse was a very good Movie with a solid Story. You should definitly check it out if you are interested in the Animation Style or you are a Fan of the Comic Books. Good job Marvel, try out more things and you will go in the right direction. 7/10"

","I've loved Spider-Man for as long as I've been breathing. Every Spidey film has given me something to love. My personal favorite has always been Spider-Man 2 (2004), but now it seems I've reached an impasse. I'm torn between Spidey 2 and Spider-Verse. An impossible decision, yes, but a fun one.<br/><br/>Spider-Man 2 gave me storytelling and cinematography to die for. Spider-Verse took that, added 4 heaping cups of explosive art, a dash of comedic genius, 2 scoops of brilliant action, put it all in a blender and hit purÃ©e.
This one was truly different.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is first and foremost an artistic dream. It showcases any color you can think of, and then some. It's a comic book quite literally brought to life. Every single frame is a work of emotional, hilarious art. And everyone, and I mean everyone who worked on this film should be truly proud.<br/><br/>To me, Spider-Verse is not what a comic book movie could be, it's what a comic book movie SHOULD be."

","I am not a fan of animated movies, but I like and follow marvel movies.
Movie starts very gently with lots of passionate scenes, especially when the dad-cop asked his son to reply ""Dad, I love you.""
This movie followed the disappointing formula, in which a movie starts off well, but then it's all downhill from there. After that scene, all of a sudden, the movie became so confusing and the story line got so slop as it was filled with many unreasonable and superfluous actions,
And once again, I was left constantly wondering when this movie would end. I didn't leave early, because I did not want to disturb the other people, if there were any left."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","9","6","18","16 December 2018"," Amazing animation and a spectacular story; pretty much the ultimate Spider-Man picture.
","Just because 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018)' is animated doesn't mean it's a 'kids' film. Here, the danger is always real, with the stakes never being anything less than (on-screen) death, and experience is all the more exciting for it. Don't get me wrong, it's not overly grim, though there is some dark stuff here; if you, or your children, have seen any of the web-head's previous films, you're probably good to go. This one is essentially everything you could want from a 'Spider-Man' story, an accessible yet comic-conscious blast from beginning to end. It really is an incredibly entertaining time, a joy of a movie that pretty much just gets better and better as it goes along. It manages to expertly mask its more conventional (though, as yet untold) 'origin story' elements behind its bolder and more unique 'multi-verse' motifs. You usually don't know what it's doing until it has just done it, even if what it has just done is the most by-the-numbers superhero plot-point you could possibly imagine, which makes for a refreshing, constantly original and highly enjoyable thrill-ride that's easily up there with the best of its genre. Plus, it has one of the, if not the, best post-credits scenes of recent memory, one that not only bookends the piece with a relatively subtle yet still intriguing tease for the possible future of the franchise but also with the feature's best joke. It's a fantastic, genuinely funny note on which to end. 9/10"

I can't say why but it just does.It really suits being animated and needs to stay there. For me it starts where the 70's series ended and looks fantastic on the screen.<br/><br/>The animation is at times jaw dropping and the action sequences are much better than real life green screen could ever be.With a perfect balance of humour and sentimentality thrown in , this suits both young and old.

"jadepietro","8","3","7","5 February 2019"," A Good Animated Film But...A Blur is a Blur is a Blur
","GRADE: B<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: Standard storytelling and a misguided attempt to be innovative hampers mostly fine animation.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Why do most of today's animated films have strong visuals and a weak story?<br/><br/>Saying Spiderman Into the Spider-verse is one of the better action hero movies is faint praise. The visual style is dazzling in this animated film and it achieves many similar effects just like its prior live action counterparts. But the film also maintains the same pitfalls by adhering too closely to predictable formulaic plotting found in most of this comic book hero genre. An overabundance of battle sequences fills most of the screen time and somewhere amid all the sound and fury is a charming tale about a likable character named Milo, an African-American teenager who gains superpowers and spends the entire movie learning to master them while fighting evil...so much for depth and originality.<br/><br/>For me, Spiderman Into the Spider-verse was only partly successful. There has been much talk and critical acclaim that the animation on display in this version is ground-breaking in its eye-popping visuals. Yes, the vivid colors are truly intense in this moviegoing experience and the film captures a wonderful pop art sensibility and hard-edge comic book graphics, although some of the drawn characters have a Saturday morning cartoon flatness (especially Kingpin, Peni Parker, and Spider-Ham).<br/><br/>While most of the action is indeed fluid and smooth, the overall effect is like watching a 3-D movie...without the glasses. Backgrounds are often blurred and the edges around the characters are either fuzzy and non-descript or lined with annoying red and blue contours. The kinetic action is always set on overload, desperately searching for those audience members with very short attention spans or possible unexpected victims who are easily susceptible to epileptic seizures. (After discussing this issue with the theater manager, I was told that it was not a bad print or poor projection, rather it was the filmmakers' objective to use this state-of-the-art effect. I listened in disbelief and after researching this matter later that evening, I was apparently being told, believe it or not, accurate information...Sorry animators, but a blur is a blur is a blur...it is not a cinematic art.)<br/><br/>Still the film remains true to its comic book origins and has moments of creative ingenuity. Kudos to the directors: Bob Percsichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman and their talented crew, although their excessive need to be technically innovative has the opposite effect for this reviewer. (A winter action sequence involving two Superheroes carried off on a runaway subway train and the dazzling climactic battle are definite highlights if one can overlook the pulsating background.) Voiceovers are well done but much of the dialog lacks witty banter. The script by Mr. Rothman and Phil Lord is serviceable but hardly memorable, with little character development and lots of frenzied action.<br/><br/>Yes, style over substance prevails in this project, even if the movie's positive message that ""everyone can wear a mask"" in order to do good in the world is a well-earned life-affirming credo. But every movie really needs a good script as well and Spiderman plays it too safe despite all of its razzle dazzle. The film's cool visuals cannot hide its predictability, conventional storytelling, and its basic squareness."
"ronaldosievert","9","3","7","2 February 2019"," ""The Matrix"" of Animated Movies.
","There are no words for this movie. It has story development, character depth, plot twists, pop-culture references, great comic relief moments, a new level of creativity - everything.<br/><br/>Not only does ""Into the Spider-Verse"" refer to the Spider-man comics and to previous Spider-man movies, it also builds new plot lines on top of already existing ones and therefore not just copying existing stories.<br/><br/>This is my favorite superhero movie. Neither ""Infinity War"" nor ""The Dark Knight"" can reach this genius piece of art (IMO).<br/><br/>You can't describe this movie. It is a must-watch for not only every marvel fan, but also for every movie fan and especially for the ones who are sick of the repeating story arcs in superhero movies. Believe me, you've never seen a movie like ""Into the Spider-Verse"", because there is none like it.

Some of the backgrounds looked like what a 3-D movie would look like without wearing the glasses which confused me to think I needed them but then the front scenes were clear so I then knew I didn't. Great visuals and story. Also, nice extended cameo by co-creator Stan Lee and touching since this was released after his passing.

"TheMovieDiorama","9","4","11","16 December 2018"," Into The Spider-Verse crawls, swings and glitches its way in becoming the best Spider-Man adaptation.
","It took Sony over a decade to finally create a decent superhero flick that involves not one web slinger, but six of them. Well, better late than never I suppose. However, it's not just a decent adaptation. Oh no no no! Much to my surprise (and everyone else's), it is one of the strongest superhero blockbusters to ever be released. In a time where saturation and fatigue is settling in, it is incredibly refreshing to see one beautiful animation reinvigorate an entire genre. Student Miles Morales is having a hard time dictating his own life, but after being bitten by a radioactive spider he soon comes to terms with his new powers. Stop right there! We've seen this far too many times now. Fortunately, something unique is injected into the repetitive origin story that we all know and love. Parallel dimensions are merged, forcing six alternate ""Spider-Creatures"" to team up and stop Kingpin from destroying worlds. So why after all these years does this work? Well, we actually have to thank the failures that came before it. The origin story has been told countless times, the writers know this and intelligently use that to their advantage. Satirising 'Spider-Man 3' and the infamous ""emo"" dance sequence. It almost lovingly pays homage to previous iterations, but translates the mediocrity into humour that consistently hits with every line of dialogue. Honestly, haven't laughed this much during a film in many years. The humour is never forced, with each punchline ingeniously executed heightening the personality of the various incarnations of Spider-Man. Mix that with the astute action that feels both chaotic and beautiful, creating frequent doses of entertainment.<br/><br/>Then the ambitious amount of character development that is spread between Miles, Peter and Gwen (the other three are utilised mainly for comedy) allows warmth and humanity to be at the core of the story. You see the natural progression of Miles as he experiences tragedy, you witness Peter wanting to repair broken bonds with MJ. The familiar yet unfamiliar environment and the newly obtained powers allows them to interact with each other, becoming better superheroes and people. It doesn't stop there though. The family life of Miles is then tested as he rapidly becomes distant from them, establishing a delicate relationship with his father and uncle. Kingpin's motives into creating a dimensional collider, although thinly developed, adds a layer of sympathy towards him. And so much more! What I'm trying to get at, is that the screenplay balances everything. It's a perfectly toned story that nails absolutely every aspect. A rare achievement for the majority of family-friendly blockbusters, whilst still catering to hardcore Marvel fans. The pop art animation is sensational. Various shots of Miles swinging between skyscrapers were breathtaking. The excessive use of vivid colours enables the comic book style to seep through the screen, almost crafting a visual comic strip. Subtitled onomatopoeia and dialogue further aids the comic aesthetic. The voice acting was decent. Whilst there were no standouts, all the actors were consistently good and gave life to the animation. Was a nice surprise hearing Cage as noir Spider-Man. My only critique, and it comes down to personal taste, is the overuse of pop music. A trend all too popular in modern animations, it may feel current now but in years to come will become exhaustingly outdated. An all original score would've been more beneficial. Suffice to say, Sony finally delivered the film that Spider-Man fans deserve. A gorgeous web of entertainment that will appeal to everyone."

From the intense action scene at the end to the small detail of a bagel bouncing off someone head, this movie seemed to do everything right. The story was easy to follow. The characters were relatable and funny. The concept of multiple Spider-people/pigs was intriguing and was pulled off really well. I think the different art styles and personality they gave to each Spider-person/pig was done so well that I cannot imagine it being done anymore perfectly. I can not stress the value of this movie enough. If you did not like this movie then you probably do not have a heart (no offense Tin-man).<br/><br/>Heck, I was going to give this a 9/10 but remembering the pure joy this movie gave I just changed it to a 10/10.<br/><br/>Important Side note: if you did not notice the bagel scene, go watch the movie again.

"rachelsilzle","10","2","4","6 March 2019"," Fresh Spin on the Genre
","This movie has convinced me that the best way to bring a comic book to life is through animation.<br/><br/>The aesthetic of this movie is gorgeous, unique, and eye popping. Just on a visual level this movie is much better than both your run of the mill superhero movie, and animated movie. The characters are nuanced, the story is fast paced but not at the sacrifice of the plot, which is simple enough for kids to follow, yet interesting enough for bigger kids to enjoy.<br/><br/>This should be the new gold standard for animation and superhero movies."
"nogodnomasters","8","2","4","5 March 2019"," We are all Spider-man
","They recap the Spider-Man story and this was the universe where Emma Stone doesn't die. A super collider gathers Spider-people from multiple universes to defeat the bad guy. Miles gets bitten by a spider and get special abilities.<br/><br/>Instead of saying quantum physics, they should be discussing string theory which would have made a better pun. Stan Lee is also in the cartoon as a store clerk. Would have made a great $300 million production, except the series with Thanos has prevented it. Cute for the kids."
"DasBobsWorld","9","2","4","5 March 2019"," Yup...it's Awesome
","As always I am late to the party with bigger release movies. I usually get to them and then complain about how the hype affects my viewing and blah blah blah. Then I watched Spider-Verse and damn...The hype was real!<br/><br/>Music, color, story, tone, pacing...They all worked. A movie about a superhero I don't even really like, that's been origin storied to death and it is fantastic. Believe the hype! Of course, I may be the only person on the planet who hasn't seen this until now, and I'm sure the reviews all cover the amazingness of the film. Stand-outs for me include the main character Miles Morales. He is a breath of fresh air in the musty mist of Peter Parker origins. In fact, his story is light-hearted, dark, and engaging right from the beginning. Even with the distraction of other spider-peoples, I wanted to see more of him. I actually could have done with less spider-people to see more of him. I also enjoyed the use of color and music. Spider-Verse seems more like a tagged art piece than a regular marvel animated outing. Its splash of color is a really fun thing to behold in today's darker hero movies. I have very little to complain about...that's new to me.<br/><br/>So, Spider-Verse is the first movie in a long time to live up to the hype for me. If you haven't seen this, then you are missing out. Also just won the Oscar for best animated film, totally deserved. Watch This!"
"rjbalao","10","2","4","4 March 2019"," Loved it!
","I've seen it 5 times. Perfect way to introduce Miles Morales and the spiderverse to the world. Can't wait too see the next installment."
"nodvinod","9","2","4","3 March 2019"," As stylistic as it gets
","The visuals are pretty bad-ass, it shows hard work by the people behind the film. Not just that, the film has heart. The problem with having too many characters in a single film is a loss of character depth, but it was nicely done in this film, you start to feel for the characters, even for the robot taken straight out of anime. The only fault, and I really had to look for one, was not lending more time to the chemistry between Gwen and Miles; when I say that, I don't mean it wasn't done well, but that I'd have loved to see more of it, I found it cool. Unlike other romance between superheroes that feel forced and have 2nd rated importance, the relationship between Gwen and Miles shone. I'm definitely into the multiverse so much so that the Tom Holland's version (due for a second film) is just not appealing anymore- in light of the trailer for ""far from home"".
In the end ""into the spider verse"" is a thorough experience, kudos to Sony for taking the ""leap of faith""."
"arielmg-74657","10","2","4","3 March 2019"," AMAZING!
","Most creative and unique movie I've seen in a long time. Beautiful artistry."
"El-Dod","9","2","4","2 March 2019"," ""It's just a leap of faith"" and this unique movie did it, way to go everybody.
","I begin with a simple question ""why did it take more than 20 years of modern animation to think to make superheroes from comic books an animation comic book style movie?"".
I think that it's one of the unique animation films you gonna ever see. The rendering style of the comic books that the animation is based on in no doubt superb and I feel it fits superheroes more than the marvel kinda thing though I am not quite sure as both are very extraordinary. The movie is creative and gonna be the first in a series of non boring superheroes movie that made a category for itself in this unique rendering style. The animation along with the movie's score are the heroes of the film with a tons of visual metaphors. The story itself is unique and creative but it was just so quick in it's events along with some of the action scenes which seemed very unclear and random and went out of order especially in the ending scene. Also the ending scene of the story along with it and the dimensions kinda stuff went out of order and made me confused especially the story and the origin of the multiple Spider-Men especially that of Spider-Woman and her relation with Peter Parker who is from another dimension than her! The 3 other Spider-Men were for me neglected and wasn't defined enough for that some of their powers were mentioned in the trivia of the film here on imdb that I didn't know about. The movie itself deserves a 10/10 for as a whole picture which was a real adventure that could have gone wrong but it went out with stealing an Oscar from Disney's movies at the end of the year marking a complete surprise and a well deserved win indeed. It stole it with the catchy story and the idea of multiple Spider-Men and the crazy costumes along with the comic book animation style, light comedy, score and songs and most importantly the comments that we are used to see in a comic book like ""booooow"" which was terrific. The classy Spider-Man jumping and swinging from a building in the end scene in this movie's style with the literally out of this world cinematography making a great combination with the costumes and again the animation. As for me, the movie is described by one word which is ""wooooooow"" and would give it a 10/10 (which it deserves) but for the storyline and unclear action and fight scenes along with the ending though it's superb. Don't you dare miss it 9/10"

I'm a huge marvel fanatic, but when I heard they were making and animated Spider-Man my first thought was why? There is already 6 Spider-Man movies they don't need to make another spin-off. I was surprised by the great reviews and when it won an Oscar I finally realized I need to see this myself. I watched it and it was literally one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's beautifully done and one of a kind. It barely had any flaws and truly deserves it's Oscar. Everything about it was great and I regret not seeing this sooner.

","This is one of the better films I've seen in years, telling a traditional story with panache, humour and feeling. It definitely throws a spanner in the superhero juggernaut because it is a Sony picture, its an animation and it is probably the best Spider-man film out there.<br/><br/>It is both familiar and sometimes quite weird, with a quality in the artwork that means there is plenty of emotion in the faces when needed. At no point did I feel the film had nothing to say, or had run out of road. The lack of focus in the visuals in the last 5 minutes compared to the art vistas on the screen for most of the time. And yet nothing truly new or original was there, just a good story and a lot of paint."
"maxim-delaet","9","2","4","29 January 2019"," Arguably one of the best animation movies ever made.
","One could say that it is easier to make less faults in an animated movie, but I disagree. For some reason not many animated movies have catched my interests as much as Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse did.<br/><br/>They definitely took some big risks with the type of humour used in this movie, but knowing how well the Deadpool movies played out, this was a risk worth taking.<br/><br/>The movie also gave some kind of sin city feeling which I really liked.<br/><br/>If they managed to give us more screentime and backstory on the rather interesting villains in the movie, it might have been a 10/10. However, this was something I missed in movie with a shorter duration than most movies in its genre.<br/><br/>I think this is a well deserved 9/10 and probably the only movie that achieve just that over the last 2 years."

At the start the FPS is a little clunky but metaphorically as the film progressed it got better as Myles was developing his powers, it was a little strange. The effects were dazzling and colourful I enjoyed what was taking place, the soundtrack too is phenomenal. Myles is a great character and I was happy he was different to last years spiderman game. The Main villain was great, he had a motive that was understanding and sometimes you kind of what them to get what they want.

"justinwestramusic","10","2","4","6 January 2019"," Loved by a long-time Spidey fan.
","I have loved Peter Parker and Spider-Man since I was a kid. I watched the Raimi films as a child, the Webb films as a teenager, and the MCU Spidey as an adult. I always felt like I could relate to Peter Parker and his struggles while growing up. I was nervous initially about a Miles Morales centered film because I didn't know if I would connect with the character as much because his story is very different from Peters. This film did a wonderful job at really tying all of the Spider-characters together. Miles grew up differently than Peter but he experienced the struggle to fit in, the loss of a loved one, having to discover and accept his true self, and more. I absolutely loved his character and his arc throughout the entire film, as well as Peter B. Parker's and Gwen's arcs. The film is very self-aware and the writers seemed to have known what people like and dislike about Spider-Man and his previous versions, as well as what people understand about the multiverse. The explanation of the multiverse was well explained without getting into sci-fi jargon. Tonaly, this film knew when to be emotional, suspenseful, and humorous at the appropriate times. Lastly, and of course this is an important point, the animation was stunning. A true comic book come to life on the big screen, and this was the perfect medium to tell this story, and I don't believe this film would've worked if it were live-action. As a long-time Spider-Man fan, who is really attached to the character, I truly found this film to be amazing. I wouldn't say perfect, there were some parts I felt could've been elaborated on or touched on, but overall, I loved it."
"zephomaru","10","2","4","5 January 2019"," Something new, something different, something excellent!

But when you do that and expand the known universe, it's special. Add to that a story with heart, humor, and relatability, and you get Spide-man; Into the Spiderverse. Simultaneously familiar and brand new, whether you're an in deep geek or a skeptical newbie, there's something for everyone. A comic book come-to-life with all the elements to also be a great movie. Only through animation could this movie have been pulled off, and it's spectacular! Lacking nothing and as entertaining as any movie I've seen for quite some time."

It was like a comic book had jumped off the pages and animated all over the screen.<br/><br/>The story hit all of the salient Peter Parker story points for young Miles without being obvious or obtuse about it and the pacing of the introduction of the other Spiders was neither too fast or slow.<br/><br/>Everything about this film, from the art to the story and the music was on point.

"geekson","10","2","4","30 December 2018"," Incredibly Unique/Artistic Animation and Exceedingly Clever Writing.
","I adore the ""Spider-Man"" universe that is partly why I was so disappointed with ""Venom"", thus I was worried that ""Spider-Verse"" would be the same, however It was the furthest from that.
The film has its own unique twist upon ""Quantum Theory"" which I think is marvellous, as I mentioned the writing is exceedingly clever, the humour is meta In the same vane as ""The Lego Movie"" but obviously instead of mocking ""Lego"" they mock ""Spider- Man"". Although I have mentioned the humour, the film exceeds in switching the tone to dramatic when it needs to, and at points becoming really poignant.
I was never overly enthusiastic over the Miles Morales plot-line line, but I have to say the film swayed me. Gwen Stacey, Peter Parker and Peter B. Parker were all great to.
The direction is out of this world and is one of the best directed animated films of all time in my opinion. The animation is superb it is so different from all the other animated films I adore it.
The emotionally apt Stan Lee cameo, writing and animation make this one of the greatest film of the year and some of the best of all of its mediums.

"dee.reid","10","2","4","29 December 2018"," Now this is THE ""Spider-Man"" movie I've been waiting to see...
","REVIEWER'S BIAS: I have been a fan of Marvel Comics' Spider-Man character since I was probably in elementary school; Spider-Man is my all-time favorite superhero. I grew up watching the excellent ""Spider-Man"" animated series from the early 1990s, and I absolutely adored the first big-budget live-action ""Spider-Man"" series that was released from 2002 to 2007.<br/><br/>Four years ago, I finally got around to reading the much-talked-about Miles Morales line of ""Spider-Man"" comics and - admittedly - I've come to enjoy his comic book adventures a lot more than I do Peter Parker's. (For you comic book geeks out there, Miles Morales was co-created by ""Ultimate Marvel Universe"" chief architect Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli, and he first appeared in the August 2011 issue of ""Ultimate Fallout #4"" - having assumed the mantle following the death of the original Spider-Man, Peter Parker, at the hands of the maniacal Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. Miles Morales is also the first black Spider-Man, and the SECOND Spider-Man to be of Latino descent - after Miguel O'Hara/Spider-Man 2099; Miles is half-black/half-Puerto Rican.)<br/><br/>For this reason, that is why I absolutely refuse to ever watch ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017), which I believe should have been about Miles Morales, not Peter Parker, and Miles Morales is the version of Spider-Man who deserves to be incorporated into the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) - especially since TWO previous big-budget, live-action film series have been dedicated to Peter Parker.<br/><br/>But you can imagine my elation when it was announced that Sony (and by extension, Marvel) was producing an ANIMATED ""Spider-Man"" movie that would finally mark the long-awaited big-screen debut of Miles Morales, and we got that this year with the 2018 Bob Persichetti-/Peter Ramsey-/Rodney Rothman-directed ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse."" And its screen-story by Phil Lord, and final screenplay by both Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman is all over the place (in a good way), and is also quite inspired.<br/><br/>Now THIS is THE ""Spider-Man"" movie I've been waiting to see, and I didn't even realize it. Now I love Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004), which is my favorite superhero movie, my #2 favorite movie of all time and is, in my opinion, the best live-action cinematic treatment that the famed Marvel Comics ""Wall-crawler"" is ever likely to see. Like ""Spider-Man 2,"" ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" appears to be a labor of love for its team of filmmakers and legion of animators - as well as a celebration of everything people know and love about Spider-Man as a character; it contains many nods to the comics, TV shows, and films of past & present. The film, by Sony Pictures Animation, is pure eye candy; it's beautifully and breathtakingly rendered and realized amazingly well - essentially a colorful, animated kaleidoscope of an animated comic book superhero picture - and the characterizations are spot-on and brought to life by a lively voice cast that includes lesser-known performers and firmly established film veterans.<br/><br/>In discussing the story, I've read the majority of Miles Morales's original comic book adventures, so I'm quite familiar with him as the new Spider-Man. I knew going in that some things were changed (how can they ever be just like the comics?), but most of these changes are minor and insignificant and don't detract from the picture, as a whole - though Miles's nerdy best friend from the comics, Ganke Lee, is noticeably absent. Miles Morales (wonderfully voiced by Shameik Moore) IS the central character here - the film's opening moments work well to establish him and his life; his family, his parents Jefferson Davis (Brian Tyree Henry) and Rio Morales (Luna Lauren Velez), and shady uncle Aaron Davis/The Prowler (Mahershala Ali); and his first days as an aspiring art student at the expensive charter school Brooklyn Visions Academy - and the film largely centers around him and how he becomes the new Spider-Man. But he's not the only Spider-person in town...<br/><br/>The vile gangster Wilson Fisk/The Kingpin (Liev Schreiber) has had his chief mad scientist Olivia Octavius/Dr. Octopus/""Doc Ock"" (Kathryn Hahn) design a machine that will open up a gateway to alternate dimensions. After Miles Morales gains spider-like powers from a genetically-modified spider that was similar to the one that bit Peter Parker - and following the death of the original Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Chris Pine) at the hands of Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin (Jorma Taccone) - he soon finds himself encountering other Spider-people from other dimensions, most famously an alternate, albeit aged and disheveled version of the original Spider-Man himself, Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson), who shows Miles the ropes of how to be Spider-Man in his world. And additional help comes from Gwen Stacy/Spider-Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld), the anthropomorphic ""funny animal"" Peter Porker/Spider-Ham (comedian John Mulaney), Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn), Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage), and Peter Parker's beloved Aunt May Parker (Lily Tomlin).<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a blast, from beginning to end. I have not enjoyed a superhero movie this much in a very, very long time. While so many superhero movies (and TV shows) these days concern themselves with such uber-seriousness and pretentiousness or silly one-liner-laden dialogue every five minutes, I found ""Into the Spider-Verse"" to be a much-welcomed change-of-pace from everything we've become so accustomed to. The movie is light and fun, but is not weighed down by the forced corniness and fake levity of most live-action MCU movies of late, or the humorlessness and cynicism of so many DC Comics vehicles. ""Into the Spider-Verse"" is self-knowing and hip and witty, and wears its heart on its sleeve, but it hits all the right emotive notes and the high-flying humor of the picture arises naturally from the material and doesn't come off as forced (again, like so many big-budget MCU and DC properties in recent years).<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" was the ""Spider-Man"" movie event I've been waiting for, and I didn't even know it. For anyone that's a true fan of Spider-Man, it's definitely worth the price of the admission. I know it was for me.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>P.S.: The film also contains heartfelt tributes to both of Spider-Man's late creators, Stan Lee (who passed away just last month and whom I had the pleasure of meeting six years ago at a comic book convention in Baltimore) and Steve Ditko (who passed away in June)."

","The animated feature, SPIDERMAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE, is the first, true ""comic-book"" film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>""But wait"", you say, ""How about the Marvel films? Or the DC Universe films? Or the X-Men or DeadPool? Aren't they Comic-Book films?"".<br/><br/>I would have to answer - ""no"". At least not in the same way. All of those properties are films that are BASED on comic-books. Spider-verse, brilliantly, is a comic-book brought to life. It includes scenes that look like pages of a comic book (or graphic novel). It uses thought bubbles,sound effect words and abstract images. The characters are distorted and when other versions of the Spider-Verse are scene (not a spoiler: it's in the title), they are designed in a different graphic style.<br/><br/>Credit for this unique vision/type of film must start with the writers, Phil Lord (The Lego Movie) and Rodney Rothman (22 Jump Street) as well as Directors Bob Persischetti (in his Directing debut) and Rothman (again). These 3 brought to the screen a dazzling visual storytelling vision that is engrossing and interesting and (I am sure) will become richer and richer the more that this film is viewed.<br/><br/>This vision must have been apparent from the ""get-go"" as these 3 were able to load some top-notch voice talent into this film - Mahershala Ali, Hailee Steinfeld, Jake Johnson, Lily Tomlin(!), Zoe Kravitz, John Mulaney, Kathryn Hahn, Liev Schrieber, Chris Pine and good ol' Nicholas Cage all bring their ""A"" game to the voices, presenting (instantly) interesting, distinct characters to this interesting, distinct world.<br/><br/>The action of this film moves at a fast-pace, but not so fast that you get lost and the emotions of the film are strong, so the ""slow"" scenes are just as well paced and don't seem too slow.<br/><br/>I see alot of films, and it is rare when I am struck with how ""unusual"" a film is. And this one IS unusual - in a very good way. I was thoroughly entertained throughout and I cannot wait to see this film again to catch some of the things I missed the first time through and have a deeper and richer experience for knowing what is to come.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: A<br/><br/>9 (out of 10) stars (yes, it's that good!) and you can take this to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

","I'm only 19, but I remember watching the first 2002 Spider-Man movie with Tobey Maguire and watching the cartoon from the 90s when I was a kid. I was also an avid Spider-Man comic book reader, I had a box with literally hundreds of comic books on the character. All of this ignited a passion in me. Spider-Man was more than just a character in a book or movie. If I felt sad I went to Spider-Man, if I was bored I went to Spider-Man, if I was angry I used Spider-Man to calm myself down.
This movie takes that love for the character and strengthens it. Everything from the story, the animation, the soundtrack, and the spider-people and villains are done to perfection. Watching this movie made me tear up because I felt like a 7 year old kid again, staying up past my bedtime to read just one more comic or watch one more episode of the cartoon.

I could not have been more wrong. The degree of difficulty here was super-high, but Marvel still stuck the landing. They introduced a new Spider-man while paying homage to other Spider-man stories and creating something that felt entirely original...and they did it without rehashing the origin story all over again. There were moments where there was a little too much happening, but the choices almost entirely paid off and almost all the characters were given their due. Plus, the animation was just plain gorgeous and the soundtrack was great. Overall, it was a great movie experience. I might have liked a simpler story a little more, but mostly I just want more of the Miles Morales Spider-man in my life."

","Let's take a second to truly appreciate what this movie brings us. It's a feel good story that gives the necessary amount of character background to help you love and relate to the characters. Not only that the plot is action packed that has enough twists and turns to keep the viewer hooked. If, like me, you have watched all the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) movies to death and are tired of the usual superhero genre plot that is somewhat tiresome and predictable (I'm not tired but I know most are) then this is actually a nice break from it all. Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is a risky movie that pays off massively, don't be fooled by the comic-book style animation as it hugely complements the film and is visually stunning. Not only that, in true Spider-Man fashion, it is filled with moments of comedy and quips that will bring a smile to your face and a laugh to your chest. It also boasts an unbelievable soundtrack which again just adds to it all. I can't wait for the sequel but until then I'll just have to watch this again and again. Stan would be proud of this one."

","This is easily the best Spider-Man film released to theaters. While the story itself is a little weak, that is made up with an exceptional animation style. You also get a great score from Daniel Pemberton (his best work since ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.). The voice work is another standout here, with excellent use of Nicolas Cage as well.
My other criticism, other than the flimsy story, does go back to the music, though. More than once, the licensed music that is played after an emotional scene takes you out of the moment. Which is a shame because other than that the choices in music are on point.
The cast of characters in ""Into the Spider-Verse"" is wonderful. Miles father is written very well and feels believable. The other Spider characters are particularly enjoyable. The older Peter Parker is very engaging and has a good arc. Gwen Stacy and Peni Parker are also very fun to see interact with everyone else.
The animation alone is worth the price of admission. 2018 will hopefully go down as the year for Spider-Man. From the blockbuster PS4 game, one of the most emotional moments in Infinity Wars focused on Spider-Man, and ending the year with not only the best movie from Sony Animation, but also the best Spider-Man movie."

"zaidmnomani","9","0","0","7 May 2020"," The Perfect Animated Movie
","Into the Spider-verse is a film that gets everything right. Characters? Unique and refreshing. Animation? Stellar. Story? Perfection. Music? Wonderful. Comedy? Fantastic. It's impossible to believe that a seventh Spider-Man film and a third origin story can be so creative and amazing, but somehow the brilliant writers behind this movie managed to do it.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Miles Morales, a young teenager who gets bitten by a radioactive spider. This character may sound familiar, but the story uses this in a rather clever way. Miles is somewhat similar to Peter Parker, but he has enough personality to hold out on his own. He has a relationship with his father that is the emotional backdrop to the entire story, which is something Peter doesn't have. He does lose his uncle as well, but the death and character are quite different from Peter's.<br/><br/>Miles, like any other teenager, is simply trying to find his place in the world, adjust to changes in his body, and try to get a girlfriend. These goals aren't gone when he becomes a superhero, but rather exemplified. He's trying to adjust to changes from the spider bite, he's trying to ask Gwen out, and he's trying to decide how to be a hero. In the end he's taught that there is no secret path to success or perfection, but rather it's a constant road in which you try and try again, always doing your best. Or in other words, 'it's a leap of faith'.<br/><br/>But Miles isn't the only character who's great in this film. Peter B. Parker is the old, cranky mentor spider-man. This character is probably the closest we get to the main depiction of Peter Parker. His story on surface might come of as funny, but it's quite tragic when you really think about it. This is a character who's been Spider-Man for over two decades, which is more than half is life. He initially started as enthusiastic, but gradually became more bitter as he grew older. Being Spider-Man cost him his marriage and trapped him into a constant loop of saving people. He has just kept doing what he's always been doing, and now he's sick of it. There's a moment in the film when he mentions he's sick of the line 'with great power must come great responsibility' , showing that he somewhat resents the line that has thrown him in this miserable life. In the end however, he decides that he's going to try again and give things another chance.<br/><br/>The other Spider-People don't have character arcs like Peter and Miles, but they all have their moments. Spider-Ham and Spider-Noir are both extremely funny. The kingpin's motive is understandable and his presence intimidating.<br/><br/>The animation is truly boundary pushing. Every frame feels alive and full. This is the sort of movie that you have to watch more than once, because there are lots of little Easter eggs, hidden jokes and more constantly lurking in the background. Ang Lee's Hulk tried (and failed) to capture the feel of a comic book through the sloppy editing. In this film, every scene naturally feels like the pages of a comic. The best way to describe it would be: This is a comic brought to life in the most visually stunning way.<br/><br/>It's rare for a superhero movie to have jokes that are so cleverly written and well delivered. More than once I burst into laughter through out the course of the story. The comedy feels like a natural part of the story, instead of it being forced or tacked on. The dialogue is equally ingenious.<br/><br/>This movie respects the character of Spider-Man by truly understanding what he stands for and how inspiring he could be. It also contains one of Stan Lee's last cameos, which is really touching. It emphasizes on the fact that Spider-Man could be anyone: whether it's an African-american teenager, a middle aged divorcee, a detective who fights Nazis, a girl from the future, or a pig.<br/><br/>But this is not just a love letter to Spider-Man, but the entire animation industry as a whole. It proves that there's so much potential and creativity to be gained from animation, and that it must live on. I highly recommend this movie, easily one of the best I've ever seen"

","The first floor was originally, we're doing a cartoon, but it's a real world. You read comics in the real world, and there are real world people in the comics, and that's fine. And then a bunch of comic book characters from other time and space travel, not to the comic world, but to the real world, which means that the real world that you're building is actually a comic world.<br/><br/>There is a kind of dramatic sense of alienation, of jumping out, which is revealed by the style of disharmony. It makes me think that this version is really subversive. The creators are so confident with love, and they don't care whether the audience can accept it or not, the box office will be damaged. We came up with the idea, and we did it, and that's what a comic book fan would do. This is so cool, just give this a standing ovation.<br/><br/>These are the things that animators do on purpose, doing 3D animation and then anti-3d, which is really fun and confident design. In this way, ordinary audiences have a sense of novelty and feel the extraordinary painting style. On the other hand must be deep comic book fan's favor, kill two birds with one stone."

","In ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" it's all about Spider-Men, as we don't get one version of Marvel's classical superhero but seven. This enjoyable action film follows high school student Miles Morales who, drum roll, gets bitten by a mutated spider which gives him similar superpowers to that of the legendary Spider-Man (plus invisibility). As ruthless crime lord Kingpin experiments on cross-dimensional travels, Spider-Men from various alternate timelines joins Miles in his quest to stop him. There are plenty of superhero movies out there, and it might be hard to persuade non-fans of the genre to watch them. A comic book fan myself, I won't lie and say that the majority of Marvel and DC films are cinematically groundbreaking. ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is however a fresh sip hero comic book adaption that combines bold, vivid animation with eccentric storytelling. Apart from its eye-popping action sequences and colorful imagery, the film wraps its exciting plot with inviting humor and emotional weight, all lifted up tremendously well by the ensemble, in particular Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Jake Johnson, and an unexpectedly funny Nicholas Cage. There are no tedious moments in this timeline-traveling film, from the most sit-at-the-end-of-the-couch fighting sequences, to the dramatic revelation that Miles' beloved uncle is a brutal criminal, I hope to see much more well-crafted, animated films in the Spider-Verse.

The movie attempts the diversification within Spider-Man's character including gender and color which might be little difficult to digest and may be that is why instead of a feature film Marvel with Sony played safely to bring it into the animation so that extra leverage can be taken with respect to creative liberties and they did it successfully as the movie already got praises from masses and critiques equally also the film got Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film.

The story, the characters, the soundtrack all tied together in a fast-paced movie that, in spite of that, never felt rushed.<br/><br/>The only reason I am giving it a 9 rather than a 10, is because I recognise that while engaging, the plot is somewhat formulaic. The villain reveal and the introduction of an over-the-top comic character felt a bit predictable. But other than that, I have no flaws to point out. Especially because the multi-universe aspect of it really gives it a distinct flare.<br/><br/>It was a joy to watch such a visually stunning movie. The best way to explain it, is through actually watching the movie. But I'll try to put it words - not only does it feel like a comic book come to life, the animation is so well put together, that it manages to successfully coexist one Spiderman from an anime-background, with another from 1930's Noir New York. That's how diverse the movie really is.<br/><br/>My hats-off to Sony Animation - this film has definitely ruined many animated movies to come for me. Because of how high it raised the bar."

","Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse is one of the best superhero movies I've seen in the decade. This new comic book style animation is extremely charming. The characters are charming. The main character has a great arc that allows us to journey with him and experience the growing pains of becoming a superhero.<br/><br/>While most superhero movies are far too eager to get to the spandex costumes and explosive showdowns as soon as possible, in this movie Miles Morales spends most of his time learning to control his powers. We get to know him as a normal teenage kid and get to identify with him. It makes the final showdown so much more meaningful when it happens at the end.<br/><br/>The one criticism I have of the movie is that I got pretty overwhelmed when all the spin-off spider characters got introduced. I was OK with up to 3, maybe 4 spiders. But I hadn't even heard of characters like Peni Parker or Spider-Ham, and they were kind of distracting in some parts. I didn't like that they took up screen time when I'd rather be looking at Peter B Parker or Miles Morales or even Gwen. But I suppose some hardcore fans would have enjoyed them.<br/><br/>Also, this had the absolute best end credit sequence I had seen in any movie. Definitely keep watching to see some real good art."

","Sony's latest Spidey outing is a vibrantly colourful and fast paced comic book love letter to the amazing superhero and a fitting tribute to the late great Stan Lee. This time we focus on Miles Morales; the Spider-Man of this particular reality who due to a universe shattering machine being used by some classic Marvel villains, comes into touch with other dimensions and indeed other Spider-People including Spider-Gwen, Spider-Noir (Nicolas Cage) and Spider-Ham (my personal favourite!) I really enjoyed this one for the most part! As much of a Spidey fan as I am and as visually inventive as it is, the animation did prove to be more of a distraction for me from an emotional entrance point into the story and the characters which is a shame (The intentionally 3D aesthetic on the background while watching the 2D version does make you feel like you've walked into the wrong screening) but it is simultaneously its strong point in terms of spectacle; different animation styles mixing together is quite lovely to watch and it comes masterfully together in the exciting final showdown sequence which is worth seeing on the biggest screen possible!

"vaniab-79439","8","0","0","7 February 2020"," A feast for the eyes
","To start off with the most obvious: this movie is aesthetically gorgeous. The art style works perfectly and it's a nice change from the ""typical"" Disney animation we see in most mainstream movies today. Such vibrant colours, the small text descriptions and character models that are purposefully not realistic but in comic book style - it all works perfectly in favour of the movie.<br/><br/>The story however, wasn't as spectacular. Not boring, just predictable. A hero gains his powers, is afraid he isn't capable of handling them, but in a nice montage he realises his responsibilities and then continues to save the day. There were quite a couple of comedy moments, some with great timing which turned out funny. The others didn't quite succeed; moreover, they were forced (the scene from the beginning with Miles' dad asking him in front of the entire school to say ""i love you"" - a bit over the top, don't you think?). On the other hand, the message this movie sends is really nice, because everyone can be a hero, right?<br/><br/>Overall, an incredible movie to watch, not so much to understand but still an enjoyable experience. Even if you don't like superhero movies (like myself), give it a go, at least for the animation style."

Don't get me wrong I love animated movies and I like super hero movies and I really like Spiderman. But I usually watch animated movies with a bit lowered expectations. They are generally entertaining but can be ""cheap"" as in weak, writing, weak voice acting, weak plot. This was a full blown made for prime time blockbuster movie.<br/><br/>The acting in this is great, they used a lot of triple A actor's for the roles. The plot is pretty good (although feels a bit rushed, but nothing you can't overlook). The style is crazy and kind of disjointed but it all works very well. It felt like an omage to Stan Lee, they literally brought a comic book to life and they did it well (a wink an a nod in Sony's general direction).<br/><br/>It's a fast paced movie that is suitable for all ages. There is some scary loud scenes and a couple of death scenes if you have littles that are sensitive this might be too much but my 5yo was ok watching and she is pretty sensitive.<br/><br/>I will be using this movie to compare all my future watchings of animated or hero movies."

However, the movie surprised me straight off the bat for a couple of reasons. For one thing, the animation is not what I'd expected. It's more Pixar than Marvel. But more significantly, the protagonist of the movie is not Peter Parker, who I regard as a boring character. The protagonist is a half-African American, half-Puerto Rican teenager who is bitten by the radioactive spider in the subway.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly interesting, allowing for multiple Spider-men and women, but I didn't get into it that much. Quite often I wasn't paying complete attention. I didn't think the animation style totally fit.

The hype gave me pause but at the same time made me wait so that it had time to settle into reality. Coming to it outside of the hype and awards, I was open to what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. What pleased me was how creative it was in several areas of production. In terms of narrative it took the risk to be silly with its alternative Spider-Men, but was able to balance that with an engaging and reasonably serious core narrative. It managed to be funny, fun, engaging, and enjoyable all the way through.<br/><br/>Animation wise it mixed many styles and approaches very well. Even when it felt OTT with the visuals, it still somehow worked and I didn't feel beaten down or tired as sometimes can happen with visual overload. The overall design of the film added to this, with good use of music, shot framing, and animation to make it feel very cool and fluid throughout. Production-wise, it felt like it ""got"" the sense of humour of the script and made that work more than it otherwise would have done.

In scene after scene, I was asking myself ""why, and how is this happening?"" Characters are constantly stopping in the middle of fights to have nonchalant conversations, and the villains just stand there and watch. In the climactic battle, the villain literally stops punching and just stands and stares at the hero for what could be a minute, waiting for the hero to recover and mount a final counterattack. Characters show up in places it makes no sense for them to be, with no explanation, just so they can emotionally affect some other character who sees them.

Its something new and fresh and i think that Sony actually did a good job with this movie. The characters are Great and most of the villians are good. I think that Prowler would be my favorite sense he had that bond with MIles making him a better character. But i cant really say anything bad about this movie its really good. Its a great coming of age story and it sends good messages to kids. But i think the only problem is that Kingpin was a bit of a weak villian. All they really showed is that his wife and son saw him fighting spider man and they dont like that so they drive away and get hit by a truck, killing them. Thats it, but i dont mind it to much.

","Since the teaser trailers release in 2017, personally, it invested me. The characters, the dynamic look, the artistic scenery... it all looked so different to what has ever been delivered in the animation genre. Surprising from Sony, the same company who released The Emoji Movie.<br/><br/>Beginning with Miles, he's such a dynamic hero in the array of Spider Men. He's more relatable and comedic than TH, TM and AG. Peter B. Parker was also a comedic hero who looked out for Miles during this whole movie. Sort of an older brother feel to him. Gwen Stacys character backstory sticked close to the comics, and both her and Miles's friendship is believable and cute. Finally, the side characters, limited to Peni Parker, Spider Noir, Peter Porker, Aunt May, Uncle Aaron, Kingpin, Doc Oc and Miles's dad. They all bring such energy to the story and make the movie such an epic, comic like masterpiece.<br/><br/>If you ever have the chance to, believe me. You should watch this movie at least once. Just to see the amazing artistic, comic like style of animation. And the most dynamic story in a movie... Ever<br/><br/>10/10"

","I'd been intrigued by this film and my interest encouraged by all of the positive reviews and word of mouth but I've disappointed a lot recently (Endgame being the biggest disappointment) and I feared that this would go the same way.<br/><br/>I guess I was sceptical of the glowing reviews that maybe it was because it was a newer, more diverse Spiderman and hence, like Capt Marvel, people weren't saying that it was good because it was well made but rather that you had to like the film because of the agenda behind it.<br/><br/>And so, with some trepidation and expectation of disappointment, I bought the Blu ray. What a relief for my fears to be unfounded. It's a brilliant animated Spiderman film.<br/><br/>The animation is out of this world impressive. It's new, it's inventive and it feels fresh. Miles is a genuinely likeable character and hence that is all you see rather than some kind of 'tap you on the head' agenda promotion. His interactions with his family are deep and well written and I certainly was made to care about them.<br/><br/>The invention also extends to the other characters and whilst there is plenty of humour from them, you don't feel the makers are trying to deliberately ridicule them to state a message.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience to watch and I am certainly looking forward to watching it again and checking out the special features."

The details and design decisions are so amazingly good. The movie is self aware and plays with the well known tropes of superhero movies, it makes this movie a fresh breath in this genre that has seen a drought in original and groundbreaking content. But this movie proves that its not for lack of material. It's quite the opposite. Here we see tasteful and honest diversity in characters with personalities. They're not just hollow stereotypes who save the day and win the girl. This has actual stakes and growth. And when we see Miles at the end listening to the same song as the movie started with, we can really feel the journey he's been on. The focus was on Miles and his journey. We don't get distracted with characters who would have made the story very busy if they had more screen time. In summary; this movie is a well written family friendly, beautiful story about the different struggles in life. It's relateble and also way out there. The visuals are amazing and it's an overall wonderful experience from start to finish."

","Spider-Man:Into the Spider-Verse
Directed by Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman and Bob Persichetti
Written by Phil Lord and Peter Ramsey<br/><br/>After enough time had passed, I knew I could no longer wait to watch this movie. It came out last December and my daughter has been raving about it since. I've let it sit and stew on Netflix for a while. Finally I simply couldn't take it anymore. I had to experience it.<br/><br/>When I say experience it, I mean it. The animation is something else. It has been described as seizure inducing. It could even be described as nauseating. It is something to behold. It feels a bit like watching a 3D movie without the glasses on. It incorporates a variety of animation styles each fitting in with the different Spider folk who find themselves in Miles Morales' universe.<br/><br/>This is still an origin story just not for Peter Parker. This is a story where we see what Spider-Man has brought to his various universes. It combines what it means to be a hero to each individual character. Miles Morales in particular since this is his origin story. The other Spider people are there to speed along his journey to his confidence. The Prowler is there to connect him to the larger narrative that exists. Kingpin is the catalyst.<br/><br/>There were some moments that made me chuckle. They don't spend much time on character development. I understand that this is essentially a kids film but the villains are given so little to do. It gives you just a sliver but that's it. It is fine but it weakens the story. The movie does get meta in a few places but that is something that Phil Lord has done before with his previous movies. He only wrote this one, not directed it.<br/><br/>The movie also moves incredibly quickly. It does not stop to take even a teeny tiny breath. If you couple that with the animation style, it can become disorienting. It is an enjoyable movie. I don't think it's one that I will watch again but it is definitely worth at least one viewing. Just prepare yourself ahead of time. Maybe some Dramamine. I give this one a B."

Starring (voices) Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, Hailee Steinfeld, Mahershala Ali, Liev Schreiber, Lily Tomlin, John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn, Nicolas Cage, Luna Lauren Velez, Kathryn Hahn, Zoe Kravitz, Chris Pine. (PG)<br/><br/>Ambitious animated adaptation of the Miles Morales storyline in the Spider-Man universe centers on an Afro-Latino teen taking over as the webslinger after the death of Peter Parker, as well as the introduction of a multiverse concept where myriad spider-centric heroes from different dimensions appear in NYC (including, among others, a perky, anime-styled Peni Parker and Peter Porker, aka Spider-Ham). Dazzling production is as close to one-of-a-kind as feature-length animated films go, combining hand-drawn and computer animation in exciting, fluid ways; it's always great to look at. Unfortunately, the story itself is often plodding, obvious, and illogical (despite the positive message it's delivering) in all the ways that hinder many modern superhero movies, and the over-extended climax is more noisy and chaotic than visceral and rousing. The voice work is uniformly good while Mulaney, Glenn and Cage's characters are the scene-stealers, but they are sadly underutilized; spin-off, anyone?<br/><br/>70/100"

"Starlightarc","10","0","0","19 June 2019"," Quite possibly the biggest cinematic leap of faith in 2018. But just like Miles, it succeeds.
","Placing a lot of emphasis on the leap, an animated Spider-Man movie was a gamble. Being animated, not as many people will go see it, as it's not Disney. Also, Sony Animation doesn't exactly have the best track record. The budget for this movie is quite high, and if it failed, it would have cost Sony millions. However, the effort and heart put into this film worked, as the film succeeded in the box office, and went on to win the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, over other great features. However, the movie quite honestly deserves it, being one of the best films of 2018. It's story is quickly paced, intertwining fast action beats with slow character moments. The action is well choreographed, and has plenty of weight to it. The voice acting is on point, and the character designs pop out, and are unique. The variety of Spider-people keep the movie from getting stale, and they work off of each other very well. The emotional beats hit hard, as many have felt the way Miles felt (In a battle between pursuing your own passion versus the one that others want for you). The message that everyone can become a hero is very encouraging to people, and can inspire them to help out in more ways than one. However, the most significant thing to note is the animation. It is very unique, having a comic-book aesthetic, with bright colors, and moments of jaw-dropping beauty. Spider-Man has been one of my favorite heroes ever since I was young, and this is my favorite Spider-Man film. It is a very-well rounded film, and has something for almost everyone. If you're still on the fence about the movie, try it. Take a leap of faith, and you just might like it."

"MovieTim14","10","0","0","16 June 2019"," Comic Book brought to life - and a genuine masterpiece to boot
","I'm not sure if there's anything I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said. That does nothing to change the fact that this is a movie that I haven't been able to get out of the back of my head since I first watched it months ago, nor does having seen it 4 times since then lessen my giddy excitement at the prospect of watching it again and again. But what exactly makes it such a compelling film?<br/><br/>For starters, this film, more so than any other in existence, truly achieves being a comic book brought to life. ""Spider-Verse"" uses a unique and wholly original blend of 2D and 3D animation that is expressive and artistic, yet actually feels more organic and human than more photorealistic animation. It is a difficult style to describe, but there are many a video on YouTube that go into what exactly it is you're watching, and just how insane the process to achieve it was. Other artistic flourishes, such as Benday Dots, panels, narration boxes, and even intentional miscoloring to replicate printing errors of old comic books, truly capitalize on the best of that medium to give character and narrative nuances that regular film simply can't deliver. The resulting hybrid of mediums is beautiful to behold.<br/><br/>Continuing with the ""comic book brought to life"" theme, the plot equally reflects the insanity that the best of Marvel's comic books are capable of delivering. ""Spider-Verse"" takes advantage of the current superhero zeitgeist we're currently in, I think, and it both rewards and plays with our familiarity with Spider-Man and superhero movies in general. This is a film that presents us with the origins of 6 different heroes, 1 villain and his multiple cronies, doppelgangers, and different dimensions - and it all moves along with the confident assurance that the audience can follow along without a problem.<br/><br/>Despite the fantastical nature of everything described above, ""Spider-Verse"" miraculously manages to remain grounded through its focus on its central character. Rather than swinging with Peter Parker this time, we are introduced to Miles Morales, a mixed Black and Hispanic teenager whose immediate struggles include feeling alienated at his new prep school, and his strict father. Miles is a captivating and charming lead. He is different from Peter Parker in many ways, but interestingly, his earnestness endears him to us the same way most interpretations of Peter do, while this universe's Peter is allowed to evolve in ways that are bold and new for his character. Both characters, along with the rest, are brought to life brilliantly by the talented cast.<br/><br/>By giving us the ""idea"" of Spider-Man through the fresh eyes of a new character, ""Spider-Verse"" creates a brilliant and beautiful thematic throughline about what it means to be Spider-Man, which subsequently highlights why the character has been so meaningful to real people for almost 6 decades now. Batman may be popular at least in part due to him being ""realistic"" and theoretically attainable, but it's Spider-Man who shows us what true heroism is, what it takes, and ultimately how accessible it really is. Chances are you'll never be bitten by a genetically altered spider, but you can still be a hero. You can wear the mask.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a certified masterpiece in my eyes: a film that is equal parts zany, serious, hilarious, dramatic, thoughtful, engaging, and inspiring - as well as a film that is endlessly rewarding with both the story it tells, and the artistic expression it uses to tell that story."

"RagingDraugr","9","0","0","11 June 2019"," A lovingly constructed, beautifully animated love letter to the Spider-Man mythos.
","I don't know what took me so long, but I finally saw it: what many people say is one of the best animated films ever made, or at least, certainly of the past few years. In the words of the ever-classic phrase, ""Does it live up to the hype?"" Well yes, essentially. Well, I guess that's the review!<br/><br/>In all seriousness, it does mostly live up to the hype as an excellent animated film. And I put emphasis on animated. Because honestly, if it wasn't for the incredibly vibrant, detailed, and gorgeously textured and layered animation...I don't think it would necessarily be revered as it is. That's not to say the story is crap or anything, far from it. It's well told, has a nice progression and pace to it, doesn't get slowed down unnecessarily and is full of a cast of colourful (or in one specific case, colourless) characters. But there are a fair few (the dreaded word) cliches in it. The one that stood out the most was the group of heroes (or other versions of Spider-Man from other dimensions) leaving the protagonist, Miles Morales, behind at the final battle because he wasn't ready. Soon after, he manages to gain complete control over his powers which he has been struggling with throughout the movie and then joins up with the rest of the Spider-Men (Mens? Spider-People? Eh, I don't know) at the battle, and ultimately, saves the day.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting a revolutionary story or anything, but some parts of it felt like I had seen it plenty of times in other films before (particularly, animated films). Now, before anyone writes me off as being a hater of this film, there are still plenty of cool things in the story. The death of the main universe's Spider-Man came out of left field. I really wasn't expecting it and it took some serious guts to actually do that - near the opening of the film no less - and it sets up the overarching plot of the story really nicely. The reveal that Miles Morales' uncle was The Prowler, henchmen of the Kingpin, was pretty neat even if his death lacked any emotional impact for me (Ah crap, we're back to negatives again). But I suppose, while we're on the subject, I wonder if there's something wrong with me when it comes to a character's death in a film or if I've just seen this sort of death so many times before that I've become desensitized to it.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to what makes the film excellent. For one thing, other than the beautiful animation, the humour is (like the film itself) fast-paced, energetic and doesn't slow down for a second. So while not every joke will land, the film just moves on as quickly as possible to a joke that probably will. The humour is also aided by the animation with little details here and there like little captions (the yellow boxes) representing Miles' thoughts ('Play dumb!'...'Not that dumb!'), referencing other comic book conventions like visual onomatopoeia ('Bagel' is probably my favourite instance of it) as well as each character having their own little quirks in animation style (like Noir Spider-Man being fascinated by the colours on a Rubik's Cube or Spider-Ham's propensity for 'Hammerspace'), which further makes each character stand out.<br/><br/>Let's see, what were other things I liked about the film? Well, I thought Kingpin's motivation was interesting: trying to bring back his dead wife and son by taking them from another dimension. At least it wasn't some generic ""TAKE OVER THE WORLD"" modus operandi that more generic villains seem to always have. Although, I think Doc Ock's character could have been fleshed out a bit more. The reveal that she was Doctor Octopus was neat, but I think they could have done more with her. Well, sequels are a thing, so we can only hope.<br/><br/>And I do desperately want a sequel because this film really is amazing, and I simply cannot overstate how beautiful this film is visually - so much so that I desperately want to look up Behind the Scenes stuff, and talks by the animators on how they pulled off some of the sequences. And yes, my only major criticism is that I think the story could be a bit stronger. But even with the weaknesses in the narrative, 'Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse' is still a lovingly constructed, beautifully animated love letter to the Spider-Man mythos that I'm sure will be thought of as a classic years down the line.<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10, with a good chance of being a 10/10...I guess. Look, I don't know where to place it, just go watch it - it's fantastic!"

","This film with its stunning action and heart warming story is by far one of the best Spider Man movie ever made. This film is a celebration of perhaps the most popular standalone Marvel franchise in a pre-MCU world. Spiderman with its asthetics and theatricality never ceases to surprise it's audience, and this film is a living tribute to t
This film proves yet again why Spiderman is so loved universally. Anyone can be a Spiderman.
The characters behind those masks be it the Noir Spiderman or Spider-Gwen or even the Spider-Pig (to a certain extent), all are extremely believable and humane. Perhaps their genuineness stem from the fact that they are normal people -- just like everyone. They are true to their beliefs.<br/><br/>As growing up, Peter Parker was my favorite. And rediscovering him in a completely new form in this film, filled my heart with immense joy. Even Morales' struggle was real and equally believable. Hence even after going through trillions of origin story of zillions of Spider-People, we are not at all bored to see the origin of yet another Spiderman. Perhaps it is the charm of these magical yet grounded characters.<br/><br/>In terms of action, the Sony Pictures Animations have outdone themselves by miles. The storyboarding and the effects are insane, plus with an added punch of humour. Even if you ignore the story or the characters (which you should not), this film deserves to get watched just for its action sequences.<br/><br/>And the music. I must say I can't remember the last time when I had enjoyed listening to the soundtrack as much as I enjoy listening to this. The music is awesome. It gives me chills whenever I listen. It is querky and off-beat. At the same time there is something epic in it.<br/><br/>Speaking of the story and the characters, then one might already have an idea by now what to expect from an original story. And this film uses that routine to almost mock itself, which is clever. The plot is perfectly paced, so as to make you glued to the film and at the same time not let you get overwhelmed by the happenings on the screen. This film is very mature in its take. Absolutely Great writing.<br/><br/>In terms of performances, Jake Johnson and Moore's chemistry was just lovely. It was a classic protege and mentor relationship but with a modern twist, which was enjoyable. Every character was unique but yet humane. Even the Spider-Pig was not just there for mere comic relief, he had substance in him.<br/><br/>I am really looking forward to watch the sequels of this film. This is a great great film."

","So let me start off my saying I'm not a fan of Spiderman or super heroes in genre. Neither do I like comics etc. When I first heard about this movie, I immediately lost interest because it's an animated movie. Also the name made it sound like it was going to be multiple short stories of different Spidermans in different universes.<br/><br/>Tonight I decided to watch it mainly because I got my hands on a UHD HDR version and I wanted to test my new TV. I'm completely blown away by how incredible this movie is. It's one of the best super hero movies I've ever seen. Aside from the avengers / guardians of the galaxy / Deadpool movies I'm not a big fan of any super hero movies. I also watched watched the much hyped black panther yesterday (again because I got my hands on a UHD HDR version) and I was bored out of my mind. I figured I'd be bored with this movie but it's an absolute gem! Even if you don't like animated stuff and or super hero movies. Definitely give this one a chance.<br/><br/>
Aside from having a great story and characters, the visuals are mind blowing. The HDR version is incredible. Visually it's one of the best looking movies I've ever seen."

","This is the first film that made me love a movie adaption of Spider-Man.
It's a fantastic film and for the foreseeable future it will be the movie I suggest to anyone who hasn't seen it.<br/><br/>That being said, it has one major flaw, and still somehow pushes through that flaw in such a way you almost forget it.
Here's the issue...
By the movies own logic, half of the Spider-Men/Women should be villains or on the spectrum. The worst case scenario for a Spider-Man character in this movie is that he ends up an overweight looser. Generally, a story about random people getting super powers is about as interesting as a TLC episode about lottery winners. It's cool to think about you winning it, but it's boring to see other people win it. So how is this story so different that it is great...<br/><br/>Be honest with yourself, every live action depiction of Spider-Man has been a 'Mary Sue'.
The story goes: he's a young upstanding boy that happens upon incredible power by chance, and since he's so great he does the right thing with his new found powers. While this movie still suffers from that issue, the story and character development completely overshadow that problem. While Miles still becomes Spider-Man by no doing of his own, it was the doing of his evil/supportive uncle that led him to the place that he became Spider-Man. While Spider-Man's uncle is a villains and while you expect him to turn around in the end, the way it happens is still tragic and an example of fantastic visual storytelling."

","""It always fits, eventually""<br/><br/>The reason I am tough on superhero movies, is (believe it or not) not because I'm a ""hater"". It's because in a world of superhero universes, and every super hero movie following similar formulas, blending into one another, and setting up for the next entries in a gigantic machine, it is simply not enough to just be a good superhero movie.<br/><br/>With Marvel in particular, the majority of the movies are good to very good, which while of course being the reason for the series' massive success, it also makes individual films stand out less and less from each other as they all melt into one big pot, where each component blends into a stew where nothing is allowed to stand out from the pack and offer anything particularly groundbreaking or unique. The brief opportunities where a Marvel film actually does something we legitimately haven't seen before are invariably the best parts of the series, before those things of course get done again and again in sequels until it loses it's impact.<br/><br/>When I get out of a Marvel movie, even one that I liked a lot, I am wary of giving it 10 stars. To me, 10 stars should represent the best in cinema. Something that was truly unique, perfectly written, technically game-changing, emotionally satisfying, and stands truly on its own without the need for prior or subsequent films.<br/><br/>If I give 10 stars to the next spoke in the Marvel wheel, knowing that no matter how good it is, it's impact will wain over a short period of time, what rating do I give a superhero movie that truly stands out? One that separates itself from the afore-mentioned homogenized melting pot that is modern super hero films to deliver not only one of the best Marvel Films, but one of the truly best films I have ever seen?<br/><br/>What rating, do I give Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse?<br/><br/>I am glad I had the foresight to call Spider-Man: Homecoming my favorite LIVE-ACTION version of Spider-Man. If I hadn't added the live-action bit, that review would have been out of date in less than a day. Because holy newborn infant Jesus, this movie is special.<br/><br/>There isn't a single element of this film that is ""just okay"". Every single thing works. Every single thing is above average. The animation is a game-changer, the musical score is fantastic, the writing is top-notch, the emotion is genuine, the plot is enjoyable, the pacing is perfect, the comedy is actually funny.<br/><br/>Every solitary bit, even stuff that would have been absolutely ridiculous in another film -in particularly the trio of Penni Parker, John Mulaney as Spider-Ham and most wonderfully, Nicholas Cage as Spider-Man Noir- not only came off as merely ""acceptable"", but as enhancing elements. Miles Morales' story while also being a perfect anchor to the crazy directions the story goes in, is great in it's own right and throughout the runtime is a source for genuine emotion and inspiration. His relationships with his father, uncle and later to a wonderful degree, Peter B. Parker are great driving forces as Miles starts off trying to find his way in the world and later has to handle the pressure of being a new Spider-Man, having to measure up to the Spider-Men, Women... and pigs, not only of his dimension, but all dimensions. You truly feel for this kid and when he has his moment of finally BECOMING Spider-Man, I felt something that I have barely felt throughout hours and hours and hours and hours and hours of other Marvel films: actual emotion.<br/><br/>I cannot state enough just how special this film is and I can count the ways until the end of time. THIS is why I often am lukewarm toward superhero movies. Because when one that is truly special and unique and comes along, I want to be able to shout it from a mountaintop that THIS is what I'm looking for. THIS is a perfect superhero movie today."

","When I saw the trailer for this, I didn't think it'd be that great. But this definitely lives up to the hype. Definitely.
The animation, music and voice acting are the strongest things in the film.
The animation is excellently done; this is probably the prettiest animated film I've seen in years. The attention to detail is fantastic and that is best represented in the fight scenes. They add ""BOOM""s and ""SMASH""s on screen. When Miles is talking to himself in his head, what he's saying is also put in yellow boxes on screen just like the thought bubbles in comics. This whole film is made to look like one massive, moving comic book. Even down to the colours and light sources being shaded like a comic book. Peni Parker and Peter Porker were very well done. I mention this because they are both completely different art styles than anything else in the film. Peni Parker was anime influenced and Peter Porker was drawn in traditional 2D animation.
The film does contain lots of licensed music in it. And this is when my one problem with the film arises. For the most part the licensed music was used well (an example being Post Malone's original song for the film), except in the emotional scenes of the film. When I'm watching a film and I'm supposed to be sad, I don't wanna be listening to a Lil' Wayne song. The films original score (although it is slightly overshadowed by the aforementioned licensed music) it is still great and fun to listen to. There was a really cool leitmotif for one of the villains that was easily recognisable.
The voice acting was great from all parties. I was surprised to learn that Nicholas Cage was in this film and all of his scenes were hilarious.
There were so many references to the comics and other Spider-Man films which were really nice to see. They used the alternate dimension plot-line as an excuse to really clearly redesign some of the villains (most notably Green Goblin, Doc Oc, Scorpion, and Tombstone).
I admire how the film didn't only use jokes that kid would get (most notably the references to films and comics and a quick Banksy reference).
This is a charming, hilarious, well choreographed, fast paced, stunningly animated film.<br/><br/>9/10"

"martinmcdonough","4","6","20","28 January 2019"," Not sure what the point was...
","I'm not sure what the point of this movie was. Usually, a ""first"" super hero movie gives us the hero's backstory, the origin of their powers, how they grapple with these new found powers, some sort of personal tragedy (that ultimately leads them to becoming a hero instead of a villain), and a focus point for the resolution of their conflicting issues in the form of whatever shape or form the villain takes. After that, it's sequel after endless sequel.<br/><br/>I get it.<br/><br/>What I don't get is the purpose of THIS movie. There already IS a Spider-Man. He's Peter Parker, photographer for the Daily Bugle, and so on and so forth. We all know about his Aunt, Uncle, the radioactive spider, J. Jonah, M.J. and the cadre of bad dudes he eventually takes on (and down). So, with that in mind, I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be (1) yet another re-imagining of the story for a newer, hip audience, (2) an introduction of several new characters, or (3) an intense marketing ploy to get young viewers interested in the printed version of these heroes? Why else would each character have it's own ""Issue #1"" cover shown during the movie as well as their own brief backstory / origin explanation?<br/><br/>It has to be one of those explanations because in every stand-alone movie or comic book, the super hero fights the bad guy typically by himself / herself without the aid of other super heroes (Avengers and other super groups notwithstanding). Spider-Man, Superman, Batman, et al always fought the Green Goblin, Lex Luthor and the Joker (among others) by themselves. But in this movie, five (or was it six) Spider-Men/Women were needed to take Kingpin down? Not likely.<br/><br/>Also, this movie had alot going on and went nowhere. The start of the movie was tedious, plodding and slow. And, most importantly, the formula was incredibly predictable. If there were any jokes, they fell flat and were unremarkable, sans the obligatory Stan Lee cameo as the comic shop owner.<br/><br/>Once the action started, it was kind of pointless and repetitive. And I kept coming back to the central question I had while watching the movie, as they kept introducing version after version of Spider-Men: do these comic characters already exist somewhere else and this movie is just a ploy to expose them to a wider audience?<br/><br/>So, the questions are: Are we being exposed to the NEW Spider-Man? Are we being exposed new, multiple Spider-Men? Why were there no new villains (and making Dr. Octopus a woman is NOT making a new villain, by the way). All of that (and more) brings me back to the central idea of this review - I'm not sure what the point of this movie was."

"moviexclusive","9","16","73","7 December 2018"," Overflowing with wit, verve and inventiveness, this latest Spider-Man reboot expands the Spider-Verse in visually dazzling and hilariously self-referential ways
","Before you groan that 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is yet another origin story on the titular superhero, let us reassure you that this animated action-comedy from the irreverent minds which brought you 'The LEGO Movie' is like no other origin story you've seen.<br/><br/>And truly we mean that in a good, even great way: producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, together with a trio of directors (Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman), have completely embraced the freedom that the animated genre provides in adapting the array of comic books of the Spider-Man canon. Untethered from the sort of realism that live-action movies are bound to, they have instead created a film with an ultra-stylistic, hyper-kinetic, over-caffeinated aesthetic that is visually dazzling in its own right.<br/><br/>Amalgamating Ben-Ray dots, hand-drawn effects and soft-focus backgrounds (reminiscent of the old non-polarised 3D movies with blurry red and blue edges), with a deliberately stilted frame-rate and signature comic-book elements of panelisation and dialogue boxes, it is probably the closest we've come to see of a comic recreated in motion. To be sure, it does get a little over-indulgent at times; in particular, the retina-searing finale that takes place inside a universe-collapsing subterranean device resembles what you may get within an overly aggressive lava lamp, playing like the most sustained stream of vibrant psychedelia we've ever recalled seeing. It's breath-taking all right, even breathless at some points, but there is no denying the imagination and originality that is on display.<br/><br/>The same can be said of Lord's script, co-written with Rothman, that boldly imagines a formula-busting origin story with a potent emotional core. At the centre of it is the character of Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), a Brooklyn Afro-Latino teenager having trouble adjusting to life inside a new elite boarding school. Miles, who first appeared in the comic seven years ago from writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli, has had great expectations thrust upon him by his NYPD cop-father Jefferson (Brian Tyree Henry) and nurse-mother Rio (Luna Lauren Velez), but prefers hanging out with his father's estranged brother Uncle Aaron (Mahershala Ali) graffitiing the subways.<br/><br/>In Miles' version of New York City, Peter Parker's Spider-Man (Jake Johnson) is a well-established community hero/ vigilante, but Miles realises that Peter's powers aren't quite that exclusive when he himself is bitten by a radioactive spider. Unfortunately, before Peter can teach Miles how to properly navigate his newfound powers, the former is killed while trying to stop the Kingpin (Liev Schreiber) from using his nuclear super-collider from ripping a gash in the space-time continuum and causing several alternate universes to collapse onto the present.<br/><br/>Thankfully for Miles, that same machine also opens up portals in other parallel universes, pulling in several alternate Spider-People into his universe. These include a paunchy, washed-up 40-year-old Peter Parker (Johnson again); the graceful, ass-kicking and too-cool-for-school Spider-Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld); the hard-boiled, black-and-white Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage); the cartoonish Peter Porker a.k.a. Spider-Ham (John Mulaney); and last but not least, the anime-inspired Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn) and her arachno-droid SP//dr.<br/><br/>Even with upwards of seven Spider-beings and five bad guys (besides the Kingpin, there is also Doc Ock, Prowler, Tombstone and Scorpion in the rogues' gallery), the movie never comes off overstuffed, thanks to a surprisingly poignant relationship between Miles and Peter.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is Miles' coming-of-age story that sees him struggling to step up to the mantle in order to save the world. Next to Miles, the curmudgeonly Peter is both his foil and his mentor, and their relationship is the heart and soul of the movie. In fact, they anchor some of the best sequences in the movie: their first encounter which finds both of them bound and dragged by a subway train through the streets of New York is both exciting and hilarious; and Peter's lesson to Miles how to web-swing through from tree to tree in upstate New York while being chased by Doc Ock is also both exhilarating and joyous to watch.<br/><br/>Yet we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge that 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' does sometimes veer into excess. As unapologetically self-referential as it is, its self-awareness sometimes proves too clever for its own good, tipping so far into fan service that it comes off rather self-indulgent. It is also guilty of resorting to the same superhero comic-book clichÃ©s that it pokes a postmodern finger at, most notably how the key to disarming the Kingpin's supercollider is a simple USB device. And there is so much going on that certain emotional notes do not ring as loudly as they should, and that is especially true of the family triangle comprising Miles, his cop dad and his cool uncle that feels less fleshed out than it should be.<br/><br/>Even so, this is one of the most original superhero origin stories we've seen in a very long while, and that alone says a lot for a character like Spider-Man which has seen no less than three reboots over the past few years. With this high-concept animated movie, Sony has finally moved on from Peter Parker in a manner that acknowledges his significance and expand the Spider-Verse in fresh and exciting ways. Credit to that belongs very much to Lord and Miller, whose sensibilities are all over the movie, ranging from its witty quips to its breakneck pace to its meta-textual treatment.<br/><br/>Fans of the Spider-Man comics will quite surely love it to bits, but there is also plenty for the casual viewer to enjoy in this fast, funny and thrilling piece of definitive pop-culture. It is brilliant all right, and we dare say one of the best Spider-Man movies ever made."

","So think about the altarnate universe s gwen stacy.She s first appearance in the movie was before miles got his powers from spider.But that scene was before portal s opening scene so It does not add up.It cant be the miles universe s gwen stacy because they first met in the film class and he did a joke in there that she mentions this joke line before she leaves so how did she arrive so early ????!"

","I fell in love with Tom Holland as Spider-Man and have been unimpressed with Sony recently, so I was incredibly apprehensive about seeing this. But WOW what a film. It was visually stunning, with all the wit and fun you'd expect from Spidey. My only tiny criticism is that at times I wondered whether I should have been wearing 3d glasses for the background and more surreal shots, but the world was beautiful and unique, so it's more stylised than wrong.<br/><br/>Loved it. And Noir was ACE! What incredible voice casting to put Cage in hahaha was not expecting that!!<br/><br/>Seriously, you have to go see this! 10/10
I'm definitely going to see this again before it leaves the big screen!"
"jeshelle","5","3","8","29 July 2019"," Not the greatest
","I don't really understand what the fuss is all about. The film is good, maybe even great, but I would never exaggerate. It's not the greatest animated film, not by a long shot. There were some confusing parts especially when they introduce a new spidey. I feel a little nauseous because of too much color. I appreciate the style they chose and I think they did a great job. But the Marvel fans are just exaggerating."

"gelf-46258","6","3","8","21 February 2019"," Ever since I saw the first U.S. dubbed Akira VHS bootleg...
","Somewhere around 1990 I got my first U.S. dubbed bootleg copy of Akira on VHS. Terrible quality (copied from NTSC to Pal) and horrible dub. Must have watched it 20 times and still did not get the story line, not until I finally got the U.K. deluxe box set including the original Japanese version with English subtitles...<br/><br/>So why am I bringing up a totally unrelated animated film from about 30 years ago? Firstly and foremost, due to it changing my view of what animation could be... forever! It's doubtful if 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' would have existed without it... or is that going too far perhaps? It changed (for the international market) adult animation in any case. Animation wasn't just for kids any longer.<br/><br/>Secondly, for me, it changed how I viewed the Japanese movie market. Despite minor hits, I still thought 'Godzilla' before 'Akira'. And to me Sony is still Japanese, and no they are, as far as productions are concerned, not strictly Japanese. But they do release a lot of (computer) animation such as 'Resident 'Evil.' Besides having a Disney-challenging animation department.<br/><br/>So... I like animation... I like adult animation... I like Japanese animation/ anime/ manga... I'm not adverse to super-hero stuff, DC, Marvel, otherwise...<br/><br/>So... why am I not loving this? Well, perhaps this got presented as ""something you've never seen before, pure innovation."" It's NOT! This may be technically impressive an innovative. But 'Men in Black 3' was not better than 'The Empire Strikes Back' due to more modern effects.<br/><br/>I like this. I gave it a 6 out of 10. The story seems aimed at younger viewers, that fine. This may be the most impressive animated feature this year.<br/><br/>I however, am still waiting, after 30 years, to see something animated that has more EMOTIONAL impact on me than Akira did... Sorry..."
"beardsmore","10","3","8","19 January 2019"," A swing and a stick for Sony, 'Into the Spider-Verse' is everything a Spider-Man fan could wish for.
","Sony's handling of certain Marvel properties over the last few years has certainly been questionable, but 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is everything it needed to be and so much more. A thrilling blend of action, humour and emotion, wrapped in an awe-inspiring animation style, 'Into the Spider-Verse' is one of the standout movies of 2018, and arguably the best iteration of the web-slinger. Marvel's animated projects are usually overlooked due to the figurehead that is the MCU, but this is a leap in the right direction. The premise of multiple characters with a great power and great responsibility, all of whom feel isolated in their respective universes, adds an interesting layer. After realising they are not alone, they seek solace in one another, working together in an attempt to find a way back to their respective worlds, each leaving understanding the importance they hold in the universe. Miles in particular finds himself along the way, overcoming family issues and the hardships of teenage life, all whilst coming to terms with his recently acquired superpowers. I'm sure we'd all like to be a spider-person, but we learn that we don't need to be the biggest or the strongest to be a superhero - because in our own way, we already are. But hey, you never know when you might get bit by a radioactive spider, right?"
"brendanbernardo","9","3","8","13 January 2019"," Bringing comics to the big screen, the right way.
","After watching Into The Spiderverse, I find myself wanting to delve into comics for the first time. Never before have I felt a movie so well captured the feel, appearance, and fun of a comic. Spider's innovative animation, which at times has a stop motion feel, creates a visual appeal throughout the film. The humor is incredible, and the culture surrounding Brooklyn is very accurate without feeling forced or like someone from outside the culture is trying to recreate it.<br/><br/>Overall, I left spider verse feeling very satisfied. I think it rightfully earned the Golden Globe and it's looking good to win the Oscar! (So I'm hopeful we'll get more of these great animated spider man movies)"
"jmmoviereviews","8","3","8","12 January 2019"," Fantastic surprise
","Another Spider-Man movie??? Surely not!! I had no expectations going in to see this one at all. I knew it was an animated version of Spider-Man where there was multiple versions of the character but that was about it. The only reason I decided to go and see it was because of some of the rave reviews the film had been getting. I must say that these reviews are entirely justified. It is a really enjoyable movie going experience.<br/><br/>Looking at the plot from the outside, it may seem confusing. For example, how can they have more than one Spider-Man etc? However, the film explains everything so cleverly and differently that not only is it interesting but it's also completely engaging."
"Henry-klein","7","3","8","29 December 2018"," Real and Objective Review
","I'm not caught up in the history of Spider Man or how the franchise has evolved over time. With that perspective, it's easy to judge this movie on its own merits. The animation is flat-out amazing. Rather than the the pages of a comic book coming to life, the creators have succeeded in pulling you into their world. Unfortunately, that's where it ends. The story line is passable but mediocre at best. The characters are bland and for an animated multi-verse the villains are uninspired and unmemorable. I'm glad I saw this in a theatre in 3-D because at home on a small screen it will be like watching a Sunday morning cartoon. Albeit, one with a 90M budget."

"dcsefton91","3","11","48","26 December 2018"," Honestly a waste of time.
","I went to see this because I thought the children would like it which is why I forced myself to sit through what was a torturous attempt at humour. But afterwards, I found out the kids didn't like it either. They laughed at a few bits here and there but overall they were bored and in my daughter's words ""watched it because it was on and we were already there"". The humour was overly forced and at some points more like a slap in the face. The action in the film was all a bit rushed and what can only be described as clumsy. The story was okay but again a bit rushed as it jumped from one thing to another. One minute nothing was happening, next minute, everything was happening with barely any transition at all. But the main thing I didn't like about it, was the style of animation they used. In complete honesty. It sucked! Massively. Overall, it was a bitter disappointment and I wouldn't recommend anybody waste their time or money on it. If you want to watch it. Wait till you can do so for free."

","First of all I have never hated a spiderman character more then Miles mourlas
it takes him 1hour and 30 minjust to learn how to use his powers and we only we see him at full capacity for less then 15 min
also it takes an hour before we see every multi verse spiderman come into play
for about 35 or so mins all we really see is miles just stumbling trying to figure out what is happening to him and as he talks to himself it getès so annoying i just want to clog my ears
the animation looks like an old video game i used to play wish i could remember which one and the music through out the film is bad bad bad
and there are only a few jokes in the movie that get a laugh or 2
with only 50 mins left in the movie we really don't see very much of the other spiderman fight until the very end and even then poky and nic cage have less then 10 min of actual fight time like i said it focus most on miles and man is he an idiot for most of the film it was very cringy another thing if i remember peter never had a father in the movies or the comics so why did he it confused me and I don't ever remember a female doc oc one last thing wtf is with the size and look of the king pin he is ugly anyway will not be buying or watching this again Ièll stick to the other flims they are way better"
"jboothmillard","5","7","27","19 January 2019"," Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
","We've seen the live-action versions with Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland, and there was the cartoon TV series in the 1960s, and a revival in the 1990s, but this was the first animated full-length animated feature for the web-slinging Marvel Comics hero. Basically teenager Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) admires Spider-Man, he struggles to live up to his parents expectations, his father Jefferson Davis (Brian Tyree Henry) is a police officer and sees Spider-Man as a menace. After Miles meets a new classmate who calls herself ""Gwanda"" (Hailee Steinfeld), he gets advice from his uncle Aaron Davis (Mahershala Ali), who encourages him to pursue her. Miles and Aaron hang out in a disused subway station painting graffiti, while there Miles is bitten by a radioactive spider and develops spider-like abilities. Miles later returns to the station and unintentionally finds a particle accelerator built by Wilson Fisk aka the Kingpin (Liev Schreiber) to access parallel universes to connect with his deceased wife and son. Spider-Man (Chris Pine) arrives to disable to accelerator, and fights against the Green Goblin (Jorma Taccone) and Prowler, Spider-Man and Miles meet during the battle and sense they are alike. Green Goblin tries to kill Spider-Man forcing him into the accelerator's energy stream but instead causes it to malfunction, he is killed while Spider-Man is injured. Spider-Man gives Miles a USB drive to disable the accelerator and warns that the city could be destroyed if the machine is turned on again. Spider-Man tells Fisk that his family is gone forever and that his plan will fail, Miles watches Fisk kill Spider-Man from a distance before escaping. The news of Spider-Man's death spreads all over New York, while Miles buys a Spider-Man costume and tries to master his own abilities, and inadvertently damages the USB drive. Miles meets Peter B. Parker (Jake Johnson), an older and slightly podgy Spider-Man from another dimension, at the grave of the original Spider-Man. Peter has been brought out of his dimension by the accelerator and needs to return home, but he begrudgingly agrees to train Miles, in exchange for help stealing data to create a new USB drive. While breaking into Kingpin's research facility, Miles displays the unique abilities of invisibility and an electric ""venom blast"" that can disable enemies by touch. Fisk's Chief Scientist Dr. Olivia Octavius aka ""Doc Ock"" (Kathryn Hahn) confronts them and reveals Peter will slowly deteriorate and eventually die if he is not returned to his own dimension. ""Gwanda"" rescues Miles and Peter, her real name is Gwen Stacy, an alternate universe female version of Spider-Man, another dimension-displaced hero, she takes them to May Parker (Lily Tomlin), who is sheltering other dimension-displaced heroes. They are Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage), a dark and monochromatic version of Spider-Man from a 1930s universe, Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn) and SP//dr, a Japanese-American teenage girl from an alternative anime-like universe who co-pilots a biomechanical suit with a radioactive spider that she shares a telepathic link with, and Spider-Ham (John Mulaney), an alternate funny animal version of Spider-Man from an anthropomorphic universe. Being out of their own universes, they are also deteriorating, so Miles offers to disable the accelerator to send the other Spider-People home, but he is shocked to discover Prowler is his uncle Aaron, moonlighting as an enforcer for Fisk. Peni repairs the drive, but the group attacked by Fisk and his enforcers: Prowler, Octavius, Scorpion (Joaquín Cosio) and Tombstone (Marvin 'Krondon' Jones III). Miles flees during the battle but is captured by Prowler, who prepares to kill him, until Miles unmasks himself, causing Aaron to realize he has been hunting his own nephew. Aaron refuses to kill Miles, so Fisk shoots and kills Aaron, Jefferson sees Spider-Man over Aaron's body and mistakenly believes he has killed him, he radios in for the capture of Spider-Man. Miles angrily returns to his dorm, the Spider-People arrive and tell him that they, like him, have all lost someone they love. They leave to face Fisk, but Peter restrains Miles, leaving him behind for his own safety, deciding to sacrifice himself and taking Miles's place to deactivate the accelerator. Jefferson arrives outside Miles's door to tell him about Aaron's death and wants to apologise for his mistakes, Miles has finally gained control of his powers and heads out, spray painting one of Peter's suits as his own. He joins the other Spider-People at the accelerator and helps them defeat Octavius, Scorpion and Tombstone, though Peni's SP//dr is destroyed. Miles then activates the USB drive and sends all the Spider-People back home through the accelerator portal. Fisk and Miles fight throughout the accelerator, Jefferson arrives and realises Spider-Man is not the enemy, he encourages him, giving Miles the motivation to withstand Fisk's attacks and knock him out with his venom blast, which also destroys the accelerator. The authorities arrest Fisk and his enforcers, Jefferson recognises Spider-Man as a hero and Miles embraces the responsibilities of his new life. Back in their own dimensions, Peter attempts to reconcile with Mary Jane Watson (Zoë Kravitz), Peni rebuilds SP//dr and Gwen finds a way to contact Miles across dimensions. In a futuristic dimension, Lyla (Greta Lee), assistant to Miguel O'Hara aka Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac) informs him of the crisis and gives him dimension-hopping technology, he decides to ""go back to the beginning"", and ends up arguing with the 1960s universe version of Spider-Man. Also starring Luna Lauren Velez as Rio Morales, Natalie Morales as Miss Calleros, Lake Bell as Vanessa Fisk, rapper Post Malone as Brooklyn Bystander and Stan Lee in a posthumous cameo as a character named Stan who sells a Spider-Man costume to Morales. The voice cast are all great, and most of the characters are good, especially the 1930s gumshoe take on the lead character, and the Kingpin who is both menacing and in moments sympathetic, the Porky Pig style cartoon version of the hero is a little weird and makes almost forced laughs. It does get a little over-complicated at times, and maybe it is much more style over substance, in animation style, special effects, and big-scale sequences, I'm not sure where it fits in the world of superhero movies and it may confuse viewers, but the kids should have fun, an unusual but not bad computer-animated superhero action adventure. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Featured Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Worth watching!"

","In the modern era, the superhero movies reign supreme in the world of the cinematic, blockbuster films. While Marvel studios universe continues to reign in dollars, there are many who state they could be getting burnt out given the 4-6 movies that release a year. As lines blur, and franchises continue to blend together to the modern public, the series needs some extra oomph to help them stand out. Welcome to another Robbie movie reviews and we are down for another review as we get set to review a massive movie week to come. Let get cracking on:<br/><br/>Movie: Spiderman Into the Spiderverse (20180<br/><br/>Directors:
Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey
Writers:
Phil Lord (screenplay by), Brian Michael Bendis (Miles Morales created by)
Stars:
Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld<br/><br/>
LIKES:<br/><br/>Animation/Design: The rest of the reviewers are correct in saying that the animation of this movie is superb to say the least. Design wise the movie nods to a number of art styles and comic book references to please many eyes of the comic book lover. It's a living comic book that has all the edge, frames, and references, but yet has vibrant color and clever use of contrast and color to stand out from the typical live action film. This dynamic only continues to evolve over the course of the film, adding more styles to the mix and integrating them into a true piece of work.<br/><br/>Story: The movie is certainly geared towards the comedy route, doing its best to make it a slap happy, geeky trendy, kid friendly comic movie for the holiday season. While zany and certainly silly, the movie surprisingly has a deeper lore to it then I was expecting. A predictable plot, this movie dives deeper into the darker dynamics of the hero, the important lessons of self-belief, and the character development that many superheroes lack. Into the Spider-Verse's compelling story makes for a solid foundation to build much off and the writing helps integrate comedy with story in a wonderful equilibrium.<br/><br/>Voice Acting: Not much to expand upon here, but the film's characters really thrive in this film with the acting contributing much toe the part. Sure the design and animation brings a piece of them to life, but the voice work adds that extra level to fully bring their inner workings to life. As the voices further integrate and play off of one another, the characters evolution begins to soar to new heights and somehow further develop the relationships between each other.<br/><br/>Clever Wit: Perhaps the biggest like of all, is how the movie just works to please a variety of fans both comic loving and general. It's got well integrated slap-stick that is simple and yet layered, mixed with a nod to a number of references and gimmicks comic fans are used to. The use of sarcasm is tactfully wielded to help add that aspect our spider heroes often wield, alongside the fantastic one-liners to be printed on T-shirts. Spider-Verse is a plethora of witty banter and it works when balanced with the rest of the likes mentioned.<br/><br/>DISLIKES:<br/><br/>Jokes a Little Too Far: The movie has a number of gimmicks into the mix, and while many of them are well-timed, they ran with one a little too far for my taste. A constant origin story beating you over the head was a nice ace up the sleeve, but that tactic got a little stale for me and my colleague as well.<br/><br/>Blurred Lines: I'm not sure if part of the art style, a reference to a style, or perhaps just editing to not smooth out the parts meant for 3-D. Whatever the case, the outline was a little messy for me, and perhaps a poor attention to detail if not purposefully crafted to have a point. If so, then kudos, but if you see this one in 3-D, I don't think this will be much of an issue.<br/><br/>More Integration of bad Guys: Understanding this was meant to be about Miles Morales origin story and the integration with the other spider-verses, I appreciate the work done for this team. Yet, the bad guys ready to face off against the team were a little bit of wasted characters for me, mostly just oddly shaped punching bags for our webslingers. One villain got the royal treatment, but the others needed some character overhaul to help them stand further out. I'll admit there is potential for a sequel to expand upon them, but for this film, a little more diving into them could have helped spruce things up and again give us characters we cared bout.<br/><br/>The Action: The action is there, don't chew my head off, and in truth it works well with the theme and atmosphere of the movie as it caters to the family atmosphere. However, being an action junkie I would have liked a little more choreography, integration of heroes, and traditional battles that this odd adventure helped. Yet, the biggest thing I wanted with the action, was a less dynamic camera angle so I could actually enjoy the animation at hand. I again admit that it felt like a comic, with action taking place off screen, but tidying up the spastic camera could have gone well. And just as the battles found its stride, the movie was over.<br/><br/>
The VERDICT:<br/><br/>Overall, Into the Spiderverse, is the breath of fresh air that the superhero industry needed to help regain interest. With surprisingly deep lore, well themed comedy, and a design that is flashy, stylized and dynamic, it's certainly going to appeal to many viewers. Yet, it's not the traditional Marvel movie and some limitations in regards to jokes, lack of hot actors, and nonlinear presentation may not ring well with the normal super hero audience. Throw in a little unorthodox action and you'll see mixed reviews coming in depending on who attends the showing with you. My scores for this movie are;<br/><br/>Animation/Action/Adventure: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0"

","This film cannot be praised highly enough, everything is flawless, art style, animation, storytelling, comedy and action are all on point throughout the entire film, and that alone makes it worthy of the hype that has been heaped upon it, but the thing that really surprised me watching Spiderverse was the way the film handles the quiet, more nuanced moments in the story, this film has so much heart, it should not be possible for a movie that includes a cartoon Pig wearing a super hero costume to be as touching and deep as it is, from the way it handles the relationship between Miles and his Father/Uncle, to the friendship that feels so genuine between him and Peter Parker, this film really hits every note perfectly, and still produces those moments of levity on repeat watches.<br/><br/>I watched this with my 5 year old Daughter, who rarely has the attention span to pull herself away from her LOL dolls for more than a 15 minute episode of PJ masks, and she didn't move an inch throughout the entire film, she was captivated by it, and now she is obsessed with Spiderman.<br/><br/>WATCH THIS FILM.

","Alright, let's do this one last time. Queens, orphan, Aunt May, high school student, radioactive arachnid, bite, transformation, discovery, paranoia, control over his powers, villain landing, alter-ego, upside down kiss, confrontation, moral dilemma, rescued girlfriend, ultimate combat, safe city one, two, three... hundreds of times, endless love, news, ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" kids' inspiration, civic homages, ah!... and by the way, ill-fated encounter, shameful evil dance and shameful look, an utterly perennial loop. Along these lines, would humanity need one more flick knowing by heart the pattern?<br/><br/>If you watch ""Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse,"" you're watching the fulfillment of the dream of a group of visionaries who, without thinking about it, have inspired millions and millions of people with a piece of art of unusual magnitudes among the wonderfully competitive modern animated film world, and, at the same time, have injected boldness, personality and brilliance into both Sony Pictures after unexpectedly wishy-washy box-office hit ""Venom"" last October and Marvel Studios' light-hearted and almost predictable live-action fanfare.<br/><br/>A milestone in mainstream American animation: Disney and Pixar lose their annual crown this time. They play in different leagues and their only two releases scheduled for 2018, ""Incredibles 2"" and ""Ralph Breaks the Internet,"" are favs among year-end movie lists, but, due to its one-kind approach and vehement freshness, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is, above all else, the non-stop-motion- relevant clarification in favor of Wes Anderson's breath-stealing showcase, ""Isle of Dogs"" -animated motion picture of the year and one of the most exhilarating, witty, socially thought-provoking and artfully made of the decade.<br/><br/>The art department led by Dean Gordon and Patrick O'Keefe and the production design led by Justin Thompson have achieved something rather remarkable: to be different, meta-discursive, self-parodic, surprisingly glued to creator Steve Ditko's unique style and mightily dynamic, progressive and dazzling at the same time; guys, this is Oscar-caliber animation.<br/><br/>Pictures, trippy and hyper-stylized, revolve and bounce, go up and down all around the screen; the composition of every frame, diligently designed and rendered as for color and motion, is a sheer delight, a miracle that will be studied and swooned over for years to come. A piece of top-notch craftsmanship, the shots here skip from the iconic to the symbolic, from the self-referential to the most unflinching flair, the computerized cinematography catches the audience's hearts and minds. Any and all sequences are viscerally engrossing, surgically sketched and masterfully carried out; its comic roots and computer animation rules well above some Pixar's and Disney's visual pieces of art in fits and starts, in part by such a care between perfectionism and personality, handling edges so special and eye-popping that the experience turns into a high-octane kaleidoscope that, even along the closing credits, keep running. It's a gargantuan homage to that iconic, mystical, twisted visual boldness that impressively Ben Davis tried to do justice in the Scott Derrickson-helmed live-action ""Doctor Strange;"" it all makes sense if you realize that he's the very same comic book artist Stan Lee teamed up with to illustrate and co-create these two worlds; a downright genius, a legend, his name, Steve Ditko, will be remembered for honor, respect and glory, in the comic book world forever.<br/><br/>Beyond genre categories, it's great cinema, period. As a feature film, prone instinctively to social drama above mega-spectacle, it overly succeeds on its devices and purposes, as well as in the flavor it delivers all over the footage between exciting storytelling and effervescent visual prowess.<br/><br/>
Inclusion. They don't get tired of wrangling over the tiresome treatment on the morally troubled, Herculean-shaped, straight, white American hero; thence, the ""Wakanda Forever"" symbol became a global phenomenon, as well as a huge step for diversity in cinema. In this film, his mother, Rio Morales, is a Puerto-Rico-born woman; his father, Jefferson Davis, is African-American; Miles Morales, our hero, is a black/Latino kid from Brooklyn. On the run, Gwen Stacy (A.K.A. Spider-Woman), an American blonde girl from the Earth-616 universe; a forty-something Spider-Man version, divorced and downbeat, Miles' inspiration; Spider-Man Noir, the 1930s Marvel detective; Spider-Ham, an anthropomorphic funny animal parody; and finally, a Japanese version, a female anime, finish up a bunch as unusual as glorious with the highest note. PC or not, such multi-diverse characters taking part in a worldwide release make this a social gem where pride sprouts from in times of bigotry and inequity. The script respects an impressive cultural range from the pages, using it as a strong commentary and storytelling device that moves the plot forward smoothly, as well as raising a love letter to diversity itself. Most of the characters here get a flat-out unusual arch as for the superhero genre concerns; Miles loves his humble former school, but now he has to settle in to an onerous all-white school for gifted children; his father, an uncompromising officer of the New York Police Department, doesn't share the means of superheroes, saving the day and destroying entire cities on their duty, they steal all the prestige of keeping the city safe; the older Spider-Man made some wrong choices, a hero on the downside in need of a new light that makes darkness gone; the story dramatically and emotionally weaves a web of plots that never neglects its genre and elegantly refuses to limit itself to the most comfortable places in utterly fabulous synergy.<br/><br/>Everybody already knows Peter Parker has not been a well-developed character in the celluloid world since his first solo movie hit theaters more than a decade ago. Everybody also knows the benchmark is that wondrous odyssey created by gifted director Mr. Sam Raimi and actor Tobey Maguire. In 2006, the spider webs dried up quickly, however, studios and fans took over the idea of starting from scratch. Eleven years later, a bold Jon Watts released a not-so-mature, fresher and more light-hearted version aided by Tom Holland's innerly charming performance. After that, many claimed Peter Parker got a new, definitive face, forgetting what was just around the corner. ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is the best cinematic comic book adaptation of the young hero ever made. The usual, everyday superhero stuff is right there: high sounding, epic compositions, a villain - with better development compared to over half Marvel's baddies, - there are death and catharsis, there are anger and betrayal, pyrotechnics and redemption, everything's there; however, the film transcends these platitudes, even leaving ""Infinity War"" so far behind in terms of depth and critique. There are harmony, magnitude, coherence, and entity; the film, from the beginning, galvanizes the story with unique style that doesn't stop shining until the closing credits, winking at and honoring its comic book vein, using the visual spectacle at its best, harmonizing storytelling and visual mastery as they don't do anymore.<br/><br/>The exclusive visual storytelling is taking all the credit, but those who crafted such dazzlingly complex marvel were directors Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman, screenwriter/producers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Passion, commitment and vision are three words that perfectly can be the soul of what these men wanted to project throughout the feature. The pre-credit dedication has a truly priceless purpose, enclosing all the ideas and feelings these people had in their minds and hearts when as they say, thousands of doors were closed, but one would always be open: to believe in themselves. We all know Phil and Chris, not only because of the controversy their ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" firing unleashed last year, but also their uproariously funny, witty scripts such as ""Deadpool"" and ""The Lego Movie."" Nevertheless, the trio of filmmakers is relatively unknown at the wheel of a movie, save for Ramsey's ""Rise of the Guardians,"" for this reason, it's even more surprising to take in that a near perfect masterpiece came out from these brand-new visionaries.<br/><br/>And now, if you venture to 'classification' lands, a do-or-die dilemma comes up automatically; sharing the throne would and must be the most proper way of doing this. ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" and ""Black Panther"" are altogether the best superhero films of the year.<br/><br/>
""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" by Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey and Rodney Rothman, above being a priceless gift for animation, is a one-of-a-kind superhero film, a respectful and sharp commentary on diversity and a piece of art for the ages; a response to the hatred, disrespect, and violence controlling minds and bodies in unjustified warfares. Is this the perfect antidote for an era of Trump, wrong traditionalism, walls, massacres, and indulgences? Forget about one of the best computer-animated superhero movies ever made, this is a reminder that we're not individuals, we're society, that dreaming is what keeps the world in motion and failure what keeps it evolving. Lee's gone now, but this cinematic feat is a proudly fitting tribute; Ditko is a maestro of out-of-reach scopes. Lee and Ditko have inspired millions, including this bunch of visionaries, who in turn have inspired all of us and our moment has come now; you know what they say: with great power comes great responsibility."

"frostv","6","2","5","24 February 2019"," Great plot, great movie for family but...
","I thought the side characters were either unutilized or just plain unnecessary. The fact they consider Miles Morales as one of the Peter Parker's made no sense. He's not an alternate reality of them as the Peter Parker in Mile's world dies. Ontop of that, the alternate Spiders,except the one that aided Miles the most, were bad. I just felt overall the same about them as I did in trailer and in the movie. The movie would of been better without them, as you could developed the Peter Parker that helps Miles alot more. Oh well... Still a great movie. Not one I'd bother to see again but, everyone seems to really like it. This is one of those exceptions that even if majority like it, I understand why."
"boatsfra","10","2","5","24 February 2019"," Mind Blowing
","Hearing the positive reviews for this latest installment of the Spidey series, I went out on a limb and watched it when it came up on my satellite channel. This movie rocks. Plain and simple. I have never seen animation like this before ever. Clearly the people behind this amazing movie are geniuses. Before the movie even starts we are introduced to the characters and get to know their story. How many movies with real characters fail to do this? A LOT!
The movie hums along like a fine-tuned sports car and after some sequences I had to pick my jaw off the floor.
What an incredible movie and why it's not up for best picture is beyond words. The sheer amount of people involved (ending credits) clearly shows this movie was made with love and Stan (not sure if he saw it before he passed) would be super proud. 2 hours of mayhem I will gladly repeat soon."
"markbarner","6","2","5","24 February 2019"," An important movie!
","I really see why this movie is important. Especially for the young black community whose hopes and dreams should have always been possible. But history has told us a different story of struggles. That's why this animated movie makes sense and why I wonder as a white male living in Scandinavia - why it has not been made before? Or where the black Superman is. We have black panther but still.
Anyways. Apart from the politics and history I had hoped the story had more guts and less of the cliches. Too many loose ends in my opinion. As this is not a spoiler I will not get into them. But animation wise I have never seen anything as wild and interesting as this. It was a mix of all comic book styles ever imagineable and with 3D animation. That detail is amazing. I felt I was sometimes reading a comic book and I haven't read one in over 20 years.<br/><br/>Sorry but the lack of an interesting story and too many cliches made me rate it lower. But the fact that a black Spider-Man exist now made me give it more points. Thumbs up to the production and characters plus the voice actors."

","Plenty of people have weighed in on this movie, so i won't spend much time on this, other than to make a few points.<br/><br/>This movie is a game changer.
Just like Disney changed everything with Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs, and Pixar Changed everything some 60 years later with Toy Story. This movie is now the new benchmark for animated movies, and what a game changer it is.<br/><br/>The graphics, design and animations are spectacular beyond belief. I don't think anyone saw this coming, me included, and it completely blew my mind. But not only is it incredibly well made, the story is also surprisingly well crafted, and the actors who portray these characters are absolutely amazing, and totally on point.<br/><br/>Don't wait to see this movie, it's one of those rare gems that cannot be missed. And in my opinion this movie comes damn close to getting a 10/10 and be sided with movies like Apocalypse Now and Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>The only animated movies i can think of right now that is as good or better than this, is The Incredibles, Toy Story and The Lion King. And i totally didn't expect that to be honest, though i did notice critics went wild over this film, and also most other people as well.<br/><br/>This movie sets the benchmark for the future, and now i just want more of this. Marvel should make their first really successful HULK movie this way, it will finally work, and we all deserve it so much, i have been waiting for a real proper Hulk film since the 1977 TV movie. Now is the time. This is it!<br/><br/>Even the new Thundercats film should seriously consider be made this way, instead of being live action mixed with CGI.<br/><br/>9/10 - Great"

"BillSims28","8","2","5","17 February 2019"," Aesthetically Pleasing, Entertaining Sensory Overload
","The 7th Spider-Man film in 16 years was never going to be winning prizes for originality. This unique animated adventure certainly tries its hardest, however. The film boasts a motley crew of multiverse-spanning Spider-folk, and covers a range of subplots. It benefits from gorgeous animation, combining a variety of styles and some devoted voice acting. It also has a consistently witty script which gleefully sends up various aspects of the a genre rife for pastiche: the creaking, lumbering beast of Hollywood superhero flicks.<br/><br/>This is first and foremost a very funny film. It most reminded me of 2017's 'The Lego Batman Movie', a similarly frenetic laugh-a-minute animated parody fest birthed from the fertile minds of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. 'Spiderverse' prides itself on mocking such infamous Spider-Man staples such as Tobey Maguire's cringe-inducing 2007 'Venom Dance' and Uncle Ben's immortal 'responsibility' maxim delivered by Cliff Robertson in 2002. The post-credits scene may just be the greatest ever shown in a Marvel property. It also gets the chance to flex its own comedic muscles. Particularly amusing is John Mulaney's bizarre, seemingly inadvertently cannibalistic Spider-Ham, as is the scene-stealing Spider-Man Noir. The latter is voiced by Nicolas Cage, an inspired bit of casting which affords him the chance to be intentionally funny for once. His character spends the film waxing lyrical about his life in a 1930s New York pulp noir novel, which garners him some of the best lines.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is similarly excellent: Shameik Moore makes protagonist Miles Morales grounded and relatable, perfecting the fine line between awkward child and self-assured teenager. This helps give stock to the film's Bildungsroman themes. Finally, Chris Pine and Jake Johnson portray two very different iterations of older Peter Parkers, with Johnson often hilarious as a schlubby, overweight 40-something long divorced from Mary Jane and struggling to fit into his super-suit.<br/><br/>The animation and entire aesthetic of the film is also a highlight. The introduction of the various alternative Spider-folk triggers a host of competing animation styles, which is never jarring and adds to the film's note perfect comic book tone, which is constructed excellently. There are some beautifully realised action sequences, especially with a comically large Kingpin at play. Computer animation really is improving with each new film these days, and it's a wonder how human these characters can be made.<br/><br/>It's not a consistent film, however. It has a large production team, with directors, producers, and writers almost numbering in the double digits, which shows. The tone is mostly well-balanced between frantic parody, superhero adventure, and coming-of-age family drama. Nonetheless I couldn't help feeling that it lacked some focus, and could perhaps have benefitted from leaving some subplots to future films, in order to develop some of the remaining characters more fully and prevent what is in the end a rather overstuffed film (I know, it's a kid's film!).<br/><br/>But in the end 'Spiderverse' has a unique charm which makes it definitely worth a watch, and I for one am invested enough to be intrigued by the prospect of future films. It may not have the staying power to withstand repeat viewings, but it's a real fun piece of cinema. 74/100."
"austinlsweeney","9","2","5","16 February 2019"," Needless to Say, I'm Keeping Her In Check
","It's not perfect. And that's what makes it perfect.<br/><br/>This is my favorite of the spiderman movies by far. The combination of the unique animation, story line, and music compliments it very well. There were times I was bobbing my head to the screen because the beats were so good. The side spiderman characters were not useless and just added in as cannon fodder, they all had their purpose.<br/><br/>There were twists and turns that I did not actually expect I liked that.<br/><br/>They kept the comic book spiderman and threw out the rest. Breaking the fourth wall. Humourous jokes. It's all there. The main character doesn't become perfect right away, he makes many, many mistakes. You watch him grow into what he needs to be.<br/><br/>
The villain has a very real, and personal reason for acting the way he does.
The hero deals with death and sorrow in a believable way.<br/><br/>It doesn't paint the superhero life as easy and perfect, it shows the human side and the part that hurts.<br/><br/>There is no useless dialogue. Everything is said with intent. Everything is done for the sake of enhancing the story."
"ivans536","9","2","5","7 February 2019"," Lives up to the hype
","Upon seeing the trailer for this animated movie right after avengers: Infinity war, I was disappointed because it's obviously not a part of the MCU and the animation looked strange, unsettling and twitchy and oversaturated.<br/><br/>However, after seeing all of the hype the movie generated after release and upon reading high praise, it was time to give it a go.
I was not disappointed, the movie really has great, game changing animation and the story is not a complete by-the-numbers superhero story.
The script is decent with some good comedy all around, appropriate both for children and adults, and sometimes it's even darker than expected.<br/><br/>Some of the plot points, such as the uncle being the villain, were very predictable, as predictable as the character's fast death.
Another problem I had was the color palette, it's trying to hard to be ""urban"" and has too much purple and other bright add-like colors, which don't really lend themselves well to a Spiderman flick.<br/><br/>All in all, a sequel would be more than welcome, however the problem is I can't see how a sequel could top this movie and raise the stakes further, or which Spiderman villains to use<br/><br/>A strong 8.5"
"hitherearizona","9","2","5","6 February 2019"," A Spiderversal explosion of light and colours.

It made me research the characters and it was very interesting to learn more about his story and the different universes... trippy in a delightful way. Happy they made this one."

"definitelynotyaseen","9","2","5","21 January 2019"," Absolutely a must-watch
","This movie is quite possibly one of the best animated films I've seen all 2018 (if not one of the best of all time).<br/><br/>The animation in this movie is just stunning. It's amazing to see that Sony Animation was behind this. I really couldn't believe it. The cellshade animation in this film is done so well that it feels that it wouldn't be the same movie if it were done in a different animation style.<br/><br/>The humor in this film is just the right amount. The way the story was played out was done well.<br/><br/>Some people have mentioned that the music was a problem but I really don't know what they are talking about. It's fine to me.<br/><br/>All in all, this is (again) one of the best aninated films I have ever seen. 9 out of 10, would see again."
"natthaphonsres","10","2","5","20 January 2019"," The best animated film and comic book adaptation of 2018
","This is the first superhero film that takes full advantage of the comic book medium, splashing it proudly onscreen with its gorgeous animation, incredible action sequences, and radical soundtrack. Crafted with genuine and absolute passion by its creators, it honors not only the talent and heart of its titular character himself, but (unlike any superhero film before) also celebrates the wider lore and mythology of the comics themselves.<br/><br/>Spider-Verse is the rare superhero film that truly and authentically explores the heart and soul of who Spider-Man. By expanding the titular superhero character to a diverse new roster, it posits the rare moral message that anyone can be Spider-Man.<br/><br/>While not without very minor grips and flaws (for example, its pacing and slightly poorer villains), Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a landmark film, a milestone in the superhero genre, and rightfully stands as one of the greatest superhero films ever made."

"aomewizard","10","2","5","16 January 2019"," One of the best animations i've watched
","There are some movies who do absolutely nothing for you, and leave you bored, uninspired and wishing for a refund. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse i far from that.<br/><br/>It allows itself to be tragic, interesting, self-aware and humorous at the same time. Every single scene was gripping and the nods and little homages to the source text was very satisfying to watch as a comic book fan. There were moments which were absolutely breathtaking (Miles 'rising,' the main fight scene where they revisit the collider and so on) and each moment never deviated from the plot.<br/><br/>Unlike movies like 'Atomic Blonde' and 'Terminal,' this film manages to unite good script writing with an aesthetically pleasing and beautiful style. Each character was fleshed out and the twist (xxx turning out to be a certain henchman) was incredibly effective. It was also very fun to play spot the celebrity.<br/><br/>The only true fault i could possibly find, in any way, was that Miles' suit should have been stiff when he spray painted it, and thats a real nitpick.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and found it to be incredibly entertaining, definitely something I could watch again, both for the story and the small details I might have missed."

<ul><li>the characters</li><li>the medium</li></ul><br/><br/>First of all, the characters are both extremely cool and likable. The design is on point, and also their movement and outfits complement their personalities extremely well.<br/><br/>Secondly, this is the best adaptation of a comic to a movie that i have ever seen. You get that comic feel, that hard copy dynamic reading experience that you would get as a kid when you would quickly jump from panel to panel in great expectation of where the action will take the heroes.<br/><br/>This movie made me feel like a kid again without any cheap tricks. It pushes the medium in such a way that after all this superhero fatigue you are getting something fresh and possibly ageless.<br/><br/>I really loved it, and think most audiences will. If you like the trailer, be assured, the movie delivers on all its promises and then some.<br/><br/>Have fun at the cinema !"

","I am not a marvel fan or any superhero fan for that matter, so my expectations are low with these movies. This one, however, was a GOOD movie.

The look of it seemed fresh and fit the comic-style of the movie. Of course, although this had no bearing on my rating, the Stan Lee cameo was very emotional for many, but I think he would be proud for this to be the last movie he performed in."
"benslammin77","9","2","5","28 December 2018"," Classic story re-told through amazing effects
","The movie cartoon style is a like a 'comic-come-to-life'. The style is kind of hard to get used to, but it is nonetheless fun and exciting. The new style is a great way illustrate movies based off of comic books.<br/><br/>The story is great, introducing a new twist. The main character is relatable in so many ways and the audience is able to connect to him.<br/><br/>Hardly any moment in the whole two hours is wasted. Each character has a key role and the story progresses with unexpected twists thrown in to keep the audience engaged.<br/><br/>Miles' struggles, at first, seemed to be excessive; but that is what makes his character more relatable. In previous spider-man movies, the spider-bitten character usually has a struggle or two but then is able to use their powers with ease. Here, Miles struggles almost the entire time until the end.<br/><br/>There are instances where older folk ask why the younger generation does something. A fun approach to trends (such as wearing shoes untied, ""your shoes are untied, did you know?"").<br/><br/>The story focuses on the big picture of Miles' life while he goes through the struggle of being a teenager while also being bitten by a radioactive spider. His family struggles are seen through his eyes, his families eyes and third person. Some situations he is able to experience from a birds eye.<br/><br/>Overall, the story is great with its premise and foreshadowing. The audience's questions are answered. The colors and thematic comic-style is fun, new and fresh."

"rustonreviews","8","2","5","23 December 2018"," Spider-Verse is a great ride, and the best since Raimi's Spider-Man 2.
","The Amazing Spider-Man is one of the longest running superhero comic books. With just over 800 issues (still on-going!), there is an infinite amount of source material to provide the basis for an endless amount cinematic outings. One of the most prominent writers of the comic is Dan Slott, who's long run provided some of the most barmy, adventurous stories of the comics history. One of his most notable arcs was Spider-Verse, which was a fun, crazy storyline that introduced the concept of multiple Spider-Men and Spider-Women joining together. With this storyline, the Spider-Man multiverse was created, and serves as the influence for this latest Spider-Man film. Miles Morales was first introduced in the Ultimate universe as the new Spider-Man who takes on the mantle after Peter Parker is killed. In his first big screen outing, Miles (Moore) is thrown into a hyper kinetic adventure in which several Spider-people join together when an experiment overseen by the Kingpin (Liev Schreiber) goes awry.<br/><br/>Into the Spider-Verse is a pleasantly refreshing Spider-Man film. Deciding to craft an animated adventure over live action was a stroke of genius, as the filmmakers use that to their full advantage in order to create a film that captures a perfect comic book feel. The animation style is dazzling and unique, with action sequences that are relentlessly fun and energetic. Visually, it's an absolute marvel. Thankfully it's not all style over substance, as Lord and Rothman's script remains focused throughout despite juggling various wacky elements that, in the hands of lesser filmmakers, wouldn't have worked as well as they do here. Spider-Ham (John Mulaney), the pint sized talking pig version of Spider-Man is one of the gang, as is Spider-Gwen (Steinfeld), Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage) and Peri Parker (Kimiko Glenn). Despite so many different styles and personalities clashing, the script finds a way that enables them all to gel together perfectly, forming a likable gang of misfits to root for. In regards to the villains, they don't feel as spectacular as the Spider-gang. Kingpin is the central antagonist of the film and is rather underutilized, but still manages to have several key scenes that stand out. Doc Ock and Tombstone (one of the most underrated Spider-Man villains) feel very one note. What works best about the film though is the dynamic between the characters, with the strained relationship between Miles and his father being the heart of the film. The student-mentor relationship between Miles and Peter is also a major standout. Ultimately, it is a comic book brought to life, and it's a hell of a lot of fun."
"ryanranshaw","10","2","5","17 December 2018"," Must see for any comic fan
","Soundtrack I've got to mention is an absolute killer. The art and how it's shot is beautifully well crafted to add extra layers to the story without you even realising. Long standing fans of spiderman are going to be in love with this. All in all its a marvel masterpiece with a touching moment at the end of the film to give thanks to Stan and Steve for all they have done for the comic world we live in today.
And the post scene credit sequence is just.. Words can't describe that."

","There has been a number of attempts at Spider-Man on the large screen, but they have been a bit hit and miss. Glad to report that this movie certainly bucks that trend and is undoubtedly my favourite spider-man movie.<br/><br/>This is an animated movie presented very much in line with the comic book origins. The best thing about the movie is that it has a heart. There are quite a lot of characters appearing, but you get an insight and understanding of all of them. You can understand the motivations behind the action which makes it much more of an enjoyable watch. This is certainly very watchable movie for an adult audience as well as the kids."

"markbuffyfan","2","12","62","24 December 2018"," Sorry not for me
","Firstly I'm a huge Spider-Man fan right from the 60's cartoon onwards. A big fan of all the Sam Raime movies including 3 and an even bigger fan of Andrew Garfield who casting was as inspired as the 2 nd film was bad thank goodness they never made 3 with the mechanical rhino . But Andrew your missed ! Slowly getting used to Billy Elliot in the role but to me he will do a better job as he gets older making Spider-Man 15 is ridiculous . This move was rubbish great animation ok story but cmon Spider-Man pig !! Really !! The award list nominations for this consist largely of movie makers of colour and as a consequence like black panther it's overhyped. This is not a racial statement it's fact . I fact my favorite Spider-Man was the John Semper cartoon series from the 90's who himself is s black guy . Sadly there is no depth to this like that incredible series ( madam Webb bits apart ) I like the idea of Miles morales as an alternative to Spider-Man but the cartoon CGI I'd to me wearing on the eye especially in 3 d ( the blur does not suit ) . So for me regrettably 2/10 and I'm being generous ."
"tfclougher","5","9","44","16 December 2018"," Universal Frenzy
","This was a bit of a shell game, quick changes, shifting focus, frenzied light show on top of scientific jargon to draw us into believing that something was accomplished. ""Timeless"" had the same conceit: go to the past to change it so that your wife and child would return. But history was present to provoke thought and I-didn't-know-that moments. I felt sorry for the gangster who produced the fantastic machine: he loved his wife and child. Sometimes death is death. The saving grace is that we miss the dead and remember them. as in Coco. Also a fantastic animation. So, on that basis, the cartoon worked. Marvel is over the top. I loved Peter Parker as paunchy. His wife missed him because he dove into his rescue work. A death of a marriage, each rescue escapade was another nail in the coffin. The visual jokes were good. The ""heart"" was there. Stan Lee was there as usual. We miss him, but his ""heart"" lives on. A bit much for the preschoolers. Cool for the older ones. Narrative lacking cohesiveness for the retired. Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" confused me at the time. I suppose I was supposed to ""get it"" but the visuals for his entry into whatever he was entering were cheesy. But, like this Spider-Man, some visuals just danced, like the Blue Danube playing while the ships docked. Swinging through a forest? Superb."
"Clank_Zoka","10","11","57","9 December 2018"," Better Then I Expected!
","Who knew there would be a animated Marvel film?.... especially involving Spider-Man, but instead of Peter Parker, it's Miles Morales' Story, so I was on board for a animated Marvel movie, about another Spider-Man character, not only was Sony Pictures Animation behind it, but Marvel was part of it too, so I was somewhat excited for it, but at the same time, worried, because the company have done alooooot of garbage, The Emoji Movie, Peter Rabbit, The Star, the Live-Action Smurfs movies and many more, but this could be a nice change of pace for the company, so Sony was nice enough to release a early preview for the movie here in the UK, it doesn't come out till next week but I got to see the movie early this week and I got to say........ I was surprised by this movie, this is exactly what I want from this movie, so let's talk about it.<br/><br/>The story is about Miles Morales trying to cope with his new school, having hard times with his father and family life in general, till one day he gets bitten by you guessed it.. a radioactive spider, and now he has super powers and he doesn't know how to control them, but then one day the threatening Kingpin (Liev Schreiber) has a big plan that could destroy Miles' world, but when he gets help from another Spider-Man (Jake Johnson), he trains Miles to become a better Spider-Man and teams up with other Spider-Man from different dimensions to stop Kingpin, so yeah.... sounds pretty simple, just another Marvel film that will be exactly like the other films except animated right?...... no actually, the movie does this sort of story in a new and fresh way, this time it's about Miles then it is just about Peter and Miles' struggle to get along with his dad and his new school, so you can relate to his situation and what he is going through, so the touching and strong emotions are there and they do hit, it's also surprisingly funny, in many ways, with Peter Parker, Spider-Man Noir, Miles and especially Spider-Ham, it knows how to visually do slapstick humour and doesn't full over the top, the humour is witty, clever and effective, it's the right balance of humour and emotion, the plot is interesting also and I never really knew where it was going which is also a good thing, very unpredictable, plus the idea of the movie is very original too, a movie where more then one comes together from other dimensions, that's really cool, plus some of the best action scenes ever put on the big screen, so creative and fast, the plot, the premise and the execution has so much to offer and manages to deliver a lot in a new and brilliant way and I applaud them for it.<br/><br/>The animation is some of the best I have ever seen, even Disney couldn't get animation this amazing, the movie has this comic book style to it and it looks amazing, with it's different colours, it would translate a scene in a comic book way, it has all these different sound effects like boom, bang, crash and many more, it looked like the animators were having fun with animating this movie, the character designs and animation are the right balance of cartoony and real, with some really interesting looking characters like how big Kingpin is and how wacky Spider-Ham is, you can tell who's who and the backgrounds are outstanding, so much colours and lots of creativity on the screen, I know Pixar, Disney are dominating the animation industry but I think this movie could change the way we see animation in a brand new way and this movie proves that any style of art can work well in animation.<br/><br/>The characters are great, I liked a lot of them, my favourites are Miles, Gwen, Spider-Ham and Spider-Man, Miles is a really relatable teen who is really struggling with family life, I really liked him a lot, he's likeable, funny, well fleshed out and carries the movie very well as the main character, he's my favourite character in the film, I also really like Gwen, she's also super likeable and has tons of funny moments, her chemistry with Miles is pretty cute and funny, Peter B. Parker is pretty funny and plays a slightly bigger role in the movie then expected, he carries the movie as well but not as much as Miles, the other Spider-Man like Noir, Peni Parker and Spider-Ham have a very unique personality, Noir is awesome, Peni Parker is adorable, Spider-Ham is just amazing in how wacky and silly he is, easily the funniest character in the film, Kingpin is a interesting antagonist, he has a reason as to why he wants to achieve his goal, he's threatening and menacing along with the other villains like Doc Ock, Green Goblin and Prowler, Miles' parents Jefferson and Rio are also relatable and have good heart to the movie and they show that they do care about Miles a lot, along with great characters the voice acting is really damn good, I mean you got Nicholas Cage, Jake Johnson, Liev Schreiber, Haliee Steinfeld, Mahershala Ali and many more, they are putting in great performances and I enjoyed all of them, with great characters who show to have promise and Miles having great development and amazing voice acting, the characters feel like real people in our world.<br/><br/>Wow, I never thought I would say this but..... Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is properly the best Marvel film yet, yes...... I said it, better then Infinity War, Black Panther, Deadpool and Spider-Man: Homecoming, But the thing is, this movie has changed animation in a brand new way, it's an original story with a great premise, excellent humour, real and relatable emotions, amazing and groundbreaking animation, wonderful characters and top-notch voice acting, so if you love Spider-Man, you'll love this one, this one will have some Easter eggs that you may notice and it has a nice tribute to Stan Lee in the credits, which I thought was really sweet of them to do, not only the best Marvel film of the year but one of the best films and animated films of the year, please check this one out, it's worth it, you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>I'm happy to give Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse a 10/10."

"skeen-69248","8","14","78","6 December 2018"," Spider-Man done right.
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse's biggest strength is knowing exactly what it is. There's no deep meanings or important messages to be found here other than the usual superhero morals and that leaves a lot of room for action, comedy and heart.<br/><br/>The animation really sells this movie; I can't say I've seen a similar style before. Whilst it can make some action sequences a little hard to follow, it is absolutely beautiful and never gets old. The writing is pretty great; the story is cohesive and different and many of the jokes hit well (clearly some Deadpool inspired humour to be found here). Miles Morales is a fantastic spider-man and alternative Peter Parker is nicely fleshed out. The other spider-men, women and pig are lacking in character but provide good comic relief and keep the film fresh. The mish-mash of villains is an interesting choice. Whilst Kingpin is definitely made the main antagonist, there are a number of villains in the movie but none are given any backstory or reasoning behind their actions other than Kingpin. This ins't necessarily a weakness however, since the film is never bogged down by trying to justify their villains and instead focuses on the fun-factor of having enough enemies for the number of spider-people in the movie. It's also worth mentioning that the soundtrack and score for the movie is pretty damn good.<br/><br/>It ain't gonna blow you away and it's not a must-see but it definitely is a fun ride the whole way through."
"Leofwine_draca","3","3","10","14 December 2019"," What's the fuss about?
","INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE is yet another in an endless array of SPIDER-MAN screen adaptations, with a crucial twist: this one's animated. It tells a complex, science fiction-oriented story of parallel universes and alternate realities, where one Spider-person from each universe has to team up to defeat a master villain. On watching, my first thought was: what's the fuss about? This is a typical Saturday morning cartoon, nothing more. The animation is nothing special and the voice performances typically OTT. The story is both convoluted and not particularly interesting, with the end result a twee kid's adventure that ticks all the boxes without ever doing anything particularly interesting. Not for me, thanks."

","Hi ELLIOT GJAZZ here.
I'm going to make this review fairly short, as quite frankly I really don't have much to say about this film.I know many people loved this movie, myself sadly I did not. I was totally bored all the way throughout and even kept nodding off for a few seconds here and there .Don't get me wrong the ANIMATION was FANTASTIC BRILLIANT, but if there is a stupid story behind it then in my book, it's a waste of time. I really wasn't keen on any of the characters except for SPIDERMAN NOIR voiced by NICK CAGE and WILSON FISK voiced by LIEV ( RAY DONOVAN ) SCHRIEIBER, both of whom I admire as talented actors. Don't get me started with that idiotic SPIDERMAN PIG which was more like POKE'MON than SPIDERMAN. That's when I just really had enough. I remember when I was a kid i used to look forward to a tv show called GLEN MICHAEL'S CARTOON CAVALCADE. This was a show which predominately showed toon type short cartoons, however there was one more serious type of cartoon, a favourite of which of mine was SPIDERMAN usually shown as a weekly 2 part episodes. This was suberb, and the reason I am bringing this up is that all that time way back in the late 60's and early 70's these SPIDERMAN Toons were wae better than this rubbish. Let me iritterate , again the ANIMATION for SPIDER-VERSE was truly MAGNIFICENT. If these guys had a better story and script then perhaps it would have been truly magnificent. One last thing. I absolutely hated the RAP MUSIC and BLAND songs. A QUINCY JONES - LALO SCHIFRIN style JAZZY score would have suited better. It wouldn't make the script better but it certainly would be more pleasing to the ear. Ending on another note I also thought the gags were awful , and could have done with the gags from AQUAMAN which was out the same week and if you read my review on it , you will see I absolutely loved it. I so much also wanted to love SPIDER-VERSE sadly however that was just not to be!"

"MrDHWong","8","6","27","13 December 2018"," The best Spider-Man related film Sony Pictures have made in years without Disney's help
","Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is an animated superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie, 21 Jump Street), it is quite easily the best Spider-Man related film Sony Pictures have made in years without Disney's help.<br/><br/>In New York City, teenager Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) is bitten by a radioactive spider and reluctantly becomes the new Spider-Man after Peter Parker's incarnation suffers a terrible fate at the hands of Kingpin/Wilson Fisk (voiced by Liev Schreiber). However, one day, Miles meets several other variants of Spider-Man and soon discovers that he isn't the only version of the iconic hero to exist within the bounds of reality. With Kingpin's new plan about to be set into motion, the group of alternate reality Spider-Man-type heroes must work together to stop the evil mastermind before it's too late.<br/><br/>Fast-paced, action-packed, and fun, Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse is just the type of Spider-Man film Sony Pictures has needed to have made for some time. The film superbly emphasises that anyone can be a superhero, no matter your age, race, size, gender, or even species for that matter. Unlike previous films, which often became cluttered with conflicting plot elements and an overabundance of villains, this one actually manages to find balance in its narrative and thankfully kept things consistent with just one main villain. In addition to this, it was great fun seeing the different versions of Spider-Man interact with each other, especially during the final stand-off with Kingpin. I just wish there were more scenes like this throughout the film as unfortunately most of this was saved until the very end. The animation style perfectly suited the comic book style storytelling the film was going for, right down to the on-screen onomatopoeia and inner monologues. The voice acting was great too, including a humorous performance from Nicolas Cage as a 1930s noir Spider-Man, as well as a posthumous cameo from Stan Lee. Being a Marvel film, be sure to stay after the credits for an amusing bonus scene.<br/><br/>I rate it 8/10"
"sonicheze8","9","11","61","8 December 2018"," A charming formula
","Spider-man: Into the Spider-Verse took me by surprise. This Sony-Marvel Spider-Man animated movie came out of nowhere, but it has sealed itself as one of the best animated movies of 2018. I found this movie to be so fun, witty and moving that I feel compelled to write an extensive explanation why.<br/><br/>The animation is superb! The comic-book style is captivating, original and incredibly aesthetically pleasing. I found myself drawn to the huge Brooklyn metropolis than most other Spider-Man movies and that shows an incredible care went into design. The animations are fast and colourful, where often it leaves the audience trying to keep up with the scene just based on how much is going on. It's picturesque and bold take on animation is riveting, and I'm just super impressed.<br/><br/>The score and audio design are also a favourite of mine, with music from Vince Staples and Post Malone being the most notable one. The music keeps the movie upbeat while subtle enough to not detract from the narrative. Another example is that one of the villains has a specific sound for its character and each time it's played, the audience can immediately identify that character. Really amazing work.<br/><br/>And now the narrative. I'll say that the plot is a really refreshing take on the superhero formula. We've all beeen accustomed to the generic origin of Spider-Man after three different Spider-Mans and I'll have to say that this is my favourite. It's funny, unique and filled with lows and highs, which is a signature trait of excellent story telling.<br/><br/>The characters are also just well made, they're made by their conventions but defied into non-archetypical characters that feel real. The other Spider-Mans are fun characters and they bring a large part of the comedic effect for the movie. The dialogue and the relationship between characters embolden the movie nicely. My only issue is that some of them don't really serve the plot in a more meaningful way but they are just so darn fun to have.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: into the spider-verse is a well made movie, one that deserves your viewing. In the end of the day, it still follows a formula, but the beauty of the movie is that it doesn't make you notice that, and that's brilliant. Because after all the formula has worked for decades of movies, and the trick this movie did is to find out why the formula works and take the best parts."
"superliggy","10","4","16","14 December 2018"," The best ""Spidey"" movie to date, and arguably one of the best comic book movies overall.
","First I'd like to applaud Sony for taking a risk, by industry standards anyways, and simultaneously making different film versions of a top tier comic book superhero. I think Tom Holland is fantastic in the MCU and will continue to watch those films but any fan boy will relish in telling you how many versions, incarnations, and different well known characters have taken on the mantle of Spider-Man through his nearly sixty year existence. Oh, and this goes for just about every other popular comic superhero from Captain America to Batman. The point being is that these characters have such rich and deeply differing story arcs through the years that studios could absolutely put two or three different versions of the same characters on screen throughout the year. Warner Bros. has also recently taken this route with the upcoming ""Joker"" (2019) film starring Joaquin Phoenix and helmed by ""The Hangover""(2009) director Todd Phillips while still planning to continue with Jared Leto's incarnation in ""Suicide Squad"" (2016) sequels and/or spin-offs.
I digress. This movie is absolutely fun to watch. It's groundbreaking animation rips the vivid colors and larger than life stylings straight from the comic pages and gives them life and pop that is both hypnotic and exhilarating. The story has a great pace that handles classic Spider-Man tropes like coming of age, love of family, and accepting moral responsibility while never seeming corny or bogged down. The voice cast is superb with great chemistry, snappy banter, and each ""Spidey"" brings a charm and wit that is unique to their universe while sharing the same brash and fun attitude that is at the core of your favorite neighborhood wall crawler. The villains are do not fail to impress either. Voiced by top names like Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali, Liev Schreiber, Katherine Hahn, classic and modern incarnations of Spidey's rogue gallery nearly steal the film with their near-terrifying and foreboding depictions. Overall this film brings familiar, obscure, and awesomely diverse characters together for an exhilarating and humorous ride with just enough heart and more than you thought you wanted action to earn itself a place in the discussion for best overall comic book movie to date."

Having been impressed by the Easter egg at the end of the last Marvel movie I was expecting a lot I have to admit. But the reviews told me my predictions of an incredible movie would be seen out and then some, but it just wasn't. The story, interesting? Yes. But beyond expectations? No. The look of the movie? Again, no complaints. My problems with this? Hmmmm... well, I guess I would have to start with there just being too many characters, the creators just seem to be trying too hard to touch ALL the bases. In that respect I guess they simply bit off more than they could chew.<br/><br/>As I asked my gf having watched it, 'What scenes really surprised you? Answer, none. Were there any outstanding scenes? Once more, a none came forth. To be honest, it was the same for me as well. Really moving and emotional scenes? Nope. Not a one. Comedy? Truly laugh out loud scenes, yet again, a negatori. This movie has been lauded as a game-changer, and yet I fail to see why. Could someone explain why that's so? For now, I remain in the dark.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this is NOT. A bad movie but any stretch of the imagination and yet it left me feeling non-plussed, that may well be to do with the fact that in the morning I saw the utterly brilliant Green Book. Anyway, go to see and judge for yourselves but for me it was well-short of the mark, sadly."

"khanbaliq2","9","2","6","20 January 2019"," Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is solid, entertaining, gritty, sharp, and funny.
","Since a few people have asked me why I don't like Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse that much, I've decided to reveal my issues with it. First of all, I do like this film. It's easily the best wide-release film that's now playing in theaters, but I think that it's not a great film or the best Spider-Man film. The main character, Miles Morales, turns out to be one of the least appealing and least interesting characters in the film, although he's given plenty of time for character development. The most appealing character, in my opinion, is the original Spider-Man (Peter Parker or Peter B. Parker). Morales seems like a poor copy of the original Spider-Man, except that, for some reason, he also has additional, unoriginal powers like invisibility and bio-electric energy. In this case, the creators of this character just couldn't come up with a new, original superhero. This isn't surprising because hardly anything that's made by people in the American entertainment industry these days is original. Therefore, they took an old, beloved character and made him black. Morales isn't a terrible character. He's appealing, but he's lacking, in my opinion. In the film, Morales is also not a science wiz. He's simply a laid back, normal teenager, who just likes to draw and who even gets bad grades in order to transfer to a less prestigious school. Apparently, the filmmakers thought that such a character would be cool for today's audience and fine for being a superhero. This doesn't work, at least for me. Can this normal, laid-back teenager really be a superhero? Is he a good example for black teens and kids? In addition, there are, perhaps, too many Spider-Man characters and too many supervillains. A few of them are just ridiculous, though they're still kind of likable, and they add little or nothing beneficial to the film. The only character with enough development and enough appeal is, yet again, the original, Peter B. Parker. Still, even with all of this baggage, the film has several good scenes that make it worthwhile to see it again. The filmmakers can be praised because of this. But these scenes aren't enough to make Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse perfect or great. So, this is my take on Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse. It's very good, it's fresh and well-animated, but it's weighed down by a few poor characterization and filmmaking choices. That's too bad. The score for this film is nine out of ten from me.<br/><br/>When it comes to what I've been reading lately, I've been able to get my hands on a few interesting history books. The first one is 'Russia and Europe: A Look at the Cultural and Political Relations of the Slavic World to the Romano-German World' (1869) by Nikolay Danilevsky. I don't know if this book is easily available in English now. I know that it used to be available because Carroll Quigley mentioned it in one of his books. Apparently, Danilevsky was the first man to divide the cultures that have existed in history into types, and, now that I've been able to get my hands on this book (because it's easily available in Russia now), I can see that Quigley was very much influenced by this book. It's no wonder, really, because Danilevsky's book features some brilliant writing. Another book that I've been reading is World History in 4 volumes (1887) by the German historian Oskar Jager. It's one of the books that Andrei Fursov recommends. Like Danilevsky's book, this book too is either not available in English or is difficult to find. It is readily available in Russian, however. For me, it became somewhat special because Jager's writing got me interested in the Ancient Greeks for the first time. The third rare book that I've been able to get my hands on is 'Political Equilibrium and England' (1855) by Ivan Vernadsky. It's mainly about the geopolitical struggle of the British Empire against the Russian Empire in the 19th century. Unfortunately, the copy of this book that I've been able to download is in the Russian language of the 19th century. It's not available in English and, as far as I know, it's not available in modern Russian either. I can still read the book, but this is not easy to do because there have certainly been some changes in the Russian language in the last century. Thankfully, the book isn't too thick. The one book in English that is readily available, and that I've been listening to lately on Audible, is Cosmos (1980) by Carl Sagan. I finished watching Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, which is the thirteen-part television series based on the book, several months ago, and I quite enjoyed it, actually. So, I decided to get the book too, and Audible offers a very good new recording of it. The only downside to a few of Sagan's works is that they feature American oligarchical propaganda. This is something that I've noticed about other American sci-fi writers, like Isaac Asimov. In the 1970s, and especially after the fall of the Soviet Union in the late-1980s, American and British sci-fi writers began to heavily promote the Anglo-American oligarchical agenda. This agenda is about typical oligarchical fuzz, like population control, the green movement, and their geopolitical aims. I'm not really against the preservation of nature. This obviously has to be done, but the rest of the propaganda isn't really to my taste. This is also why I don't like Frank Herbert's novel Dune that much. It's undoubted that Dune is one of the best-written science-fiction novels in the English language, but the oligarchical propaganda that it contains isn't entirely to my taste. First of all, Dune is about a future that's not really progressive. In the antiquated future of Dune, the interstellar society is ruled by noble houses in control of individual planets. So, this is certainly not some futuristic, improved society that you might see in a franchise like Star Trek. It's not even a democratic society. It's a hierarchical society of nobles and royalty that very much appeals to the modern Western capitalist oligarchy. It can also be said that Dune is in tune with the environmental agenda of the Western elite, and this is why this old novel remains so popular and why it's promoted so heavily in the West. Dune was published in 1965, and, in the decades since then, the science-fiction genre in the West has largely been turned by the Western elite into a genre that promotes the environmental agenda. This is not something that I find to be very distasteful, but it is something that should be noted."

","After a few attempts at making Spider-Man films, Sony have redeemed themselves with a cleverly made comedic superhero film, Spider-Man Into The Spider-Verse. This movie is fantastic in a lot of ways<br/><br/>The animation is outstanding. Very smooth and well made. I like also how they introduced new animation styles as the film went on, introducing characters drawn like anime characters and a Looney Tunes character.<br/><br/>The voice acting is very good. Shameik Moore as Miles Morales is a very convincing character. Mahershala Ali as Uncle Aaron is a very great character with a lot of development. And Levi Shcreiber as the Kingpin is very good.<br/><br/>The narrative as well is very well written. I like how the followed the comic book style in creating this film visually. You are literally watching a comic book, that's what I thought when I watched Spider-Man Homecoming, but seeing this movie, I am wrong. Visually, this film is superb. There's also a lot of emotion embedded in the story. Miles has a hard relationship with his dad, and looks up to his uncle who go his dad says isn't the best role model.<br/><br/>However, the flaws that I have in this film:<br/><br/>Altogether the Kingpin is a good villain, I found his reason to build this machine for his own purpose, it wasn't strong enough for me to show any sympathy or emotion for him. His development wasn't built up the greatest, and that was a shame.<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10"

The comedy and voice acting is on point, using its highly stylised animation to its advantage. The characters are all great especially miles and peter, although the others all have their own time to shine. This film is brilliant with great themes and messages with the best Stan Lee cameo and end credit scene. The only reason I give it a 9 and not a 10, is a small few gripes that I was a bit confused in how characters got to certain things places and a certain character development that wasn't really explained, as well as Kingpin not getting as much development as I would of liked. Other than that l, I found it absolutely amazing. Would highly recommend"
"xx-slay-n-xx","10","1","2","22 April 2020"," Coloring the Mind, Exhilarating the Soul
","Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse didn't need to be this good. In 2018, superhero movies, especially Marvel movies, have a reputation which precedes them. People know what to expect when they walk into a superhero movie, and with little or no marketing involved, even a mediocre origin story can rake in a billion at the box office. Instead of delivering us some generic filler movie in between Avengers flicks, Into the Spider-Verse sends us on an exhilarating joy-ride into jaw-dropping visuals and story. This film is more than a film, it is a roller-coaster ride for all the senses; it genuinely left me feeling breathless and exhausted, in a good way.<br/><br/>From the very first moment of the film until the very last moment, the film is a visual masterpiece. I am not even saying the beginning and end of the narrative portion of the film, but even the opening title screen and end credits. Not a single inch of this canvas was left untouched. It is a Hieronymus Bosch painting in the form of a film. The effort that went in to creating a compelling and interesting world is mind-boggling. It almost seems impossible that any team of people could produce something so fabulous.<br/><br/>It reminds me of Princess Mononoke (1997) for its attention to detail, in which Hayao Miyazaki is said to have personally gone through each frame to perfect the backgrounds and make it lifelike. Take Time's Square, which we only see in the briefest of flashes. They had every right to phone it in on the details as the city hurtles past too quickly to be really taken in, but instead they jammed each frame full with colorful imagery, jokes and references. The close attention to detail makes it so fun to watch at every moment. Usually I am one to stay at least for part of the credits scene, but in this film it's not even difficult because through to the rolling of the cast credits, it still maintains the engrossing colors and imagery.<br/><br/>The most obvious visual work going on in the film is the comic book nature. If we have a spectrum with Hulk (2003) at one end, representing the overuse of comic-book style to create campiness, Spider-Verse is on the polar opposite side, using the comic-book features so well that it is a work of art in itself. It is so tastefully done and compliments the story so perfectly that it feels like so much more than just a film. It is all visual mediums condensed into two hours. We get insights into characters thoughts through dialogue bubbles, we get brief and entertaining backstories as the flipping pages of a comic, the villains are made to be so much more cartoonishly villainous, and so much more.<br/><br/>We are given such an amazing variety of interesting characters. Miles is a healthy mix of believably awkward, funny, charming and shy. He is one of the most realistic teenagers in film and somehow his situation, as unbelievable as it is, feels right. Peter Parker is a balance of heroic crime-fighter and derelict bum. He has flashes of brilliance as a mentor to Miles, but he has been through extraordinary trauma, and we see that at the proper moments to make him down to earth. Aunt May is usually just a helpless old-lady, but now she's a badass. Even Kingpin has an emotional arc that makes him a sympathetic villain, but we can still hate him as the antagonist. All of the other Spiders and villains only compliment each other and never go over the top. Peni, Noir and Spider-ham could have been nothing more than hilarious comic-relief, and they did that exceptionally, but they were used sparingly enough to not overpower the mood of the story or get in the way of the action. In fact they added to it and gave this movie a unique twist that other superhero movies don't have.<br/><br/>I could just go on and on about all the amazing work done in this film. The sound design and song choices are spectacular. The plot is interesting and unique. The dialogue is so on point with its wittiness and intrigue. And oh my god, the visuals. I know I talked about this already, but good lord it is just beautiful. It's cyberpunk mixed with Dadaism, mixed with a kaleidoscopic, on acid, thrown into a blender and then molded by Michelangelo into a statue of the gods of Olympus. This movie attacks you from every side all at once and is relentless in its wonder. I could just go on and on about it, but it must be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>Sometimes it can almost be difficult to critically review a film when it is so good and it has such an emotional resonance with you. This is how it felt with me during this movie. I don't want to just write about this movie, I want to experience it again and again. It has transcended my normal viewing pleasures and gripped me so wholly that it almost seems personally and purposefully constructed. Sometimes you just need to take a step back from something you love and take a breath. You can get lost in it if you look too long. This is so much more than a film. It is a monument to art and cinema. This is not just superheroes, this is sensory heroin."

","I wasn't able to make it through the first hour of this movie. First of all - it's a beautiful looking film, one of the best looking animated films I've ever seen. And I also loved Lord & Miller's quips. It's funny.<br/><br/>My first problem was that the movie is its opening 45 minutes. They were a cringe diversity checklist (and this is coming from a minority). At least make the introduction of all the characters organic for god's sake. Spider Gwen's intro was one of the most obvious in the history of comic book movies.<br/><br/>Another -- even larger problem was that the constant interjection of jokes and quips undermined every single bit of drama that there was to be had. I like jokes just as much as the next person but once in a while just let the drama build. Is that too hard? There doesn't have to be a joke every single minute. This was like a Marvel movie on steroids, in the absolute worst way. Very disappointing."

","Now by the title you must be thinking that I'm one of those people who just for the sake of being a idiot calling a really great film not so great cuz I want to standout, well NO! I really and Genuinely feel like into the spider verse is quite overrated, now do not confuse overrated with bad, at the end of the film I actually found myself really enjoying this one, I watched it with my lil brother who's a massive Spiderman fan we really had a great time, the characters were enjoyable, the humour was good, The animation was jaw dropping it was spectacular, the story was good, the villains could have been better but the director gave the main villain a backstory which I would say for the most part is convincing but not anything we haven't seen in tons of other comic book movie but he wasn't a hindrance so not a big issue for me... Cuz this film really focuse on the journey of miles Morales which I was never really interested in, but this movie did the character a justice and he served his purpose well so what went wrong?
THE FAN BASE I watched this movie pretty late, I waited for this movie to come on OT platform and it did and I watched it, basically every reviews I read about this movie everyone was praising how brilliant this movie is.. what an amazing time people had in the theatres.. hailing this movie as not only one of the best comic book films of the year but one of the best movies of the year.. some of the latest reviews that I've seen people count into the spider verse as one of the best films of the DECADE! and I was like OHK. fine I'll watch it then. Now I didn't watch this movie with sky high expectations.. whenever I watch a film I try to watch it with as minimum expectations as possible and into the spider verse was no exception in that way I can enjoy a good movie to its full potential and to watch really bad movie by not getting too frustrated
And after the film I was entertained but I was thinking what was in this film which made people really appreciate it's quality talking so many great things about it which made this film won an OSCAR for a featured animated film where some other movies like A Silent Voice, Your Name, Wolfchildren, The Wind Rises, When Marnie Was There and Grave Of The Fireflies. were not even considered for Nominations and into the spider verse was. Although I've already lost my faith in OSCAR but I thought people really had a better understanding of what should be great and what not should be
Look I'm not a hater of this movie and I'm not being a harsh critch either. I like this movie I would rather was 100s of into the spider verse than one Homecoming or Far From Home but I wouldn't exaggerate by counting it as one of the greatest."

I still hated it. Seriously, I freaking despised this movie. Why people love this movie is beyond me... and yet... it won the OSCAR for best animated feature!!!! Slow year for animated films maybe?<br/><br/>Well, maybe, or MAYBE I'm just missing something. I just find absolutely nothing of redeeming value whatsoever in Into the Spiderverse. You've got to also bear in mind I LOVE the MCU Spiderman. I think Spiderman Homecoming and Spiderman Far From Home are really good movies. It's just very difficult for me to take this movie seriously when it's so overwhelmingly goofy. I think that's my problem.<br/><br/>And yet... kids and adults alike SOMEHOW like this movie! So maybe I am missing something, and maybe I should concede that this just isn't a movie for me. I didn't like it at all, but hey I guess chances are you and your kids will."

"salonsoab","10","1","2","11 November 2019"," Best Spider-man film by far
","This film is a masterpiece, and it has everything I want for a film to have: relatable and developed characters, great villain, amazing visuals, coherent and brilliantly scripted plot, and an amazing soundtrack. Into the Spider-verse tells a story that has never been done well, and it elevates it bringing different themes into the mix. This is without a doubt one of the best animated movies of all time, and it definitely deserves to be watched by everyone."
"JessieCollins1","9","1","2","8 November 2019"," Pretty okay for an animated film
","Spider-Man has always been that character that I saw in live-action movies so to see him in an animated version was a first for me. It was hard for me to enjoy it at first but the movie didn't seem too bad and had a really good plot."
"Neptune165","10","1","2","13 September 2019"," This is legit my fave movie of 2018.
","This film is better than Incredibles 2 and more deserving of winning Best Animated Feature. Incredibles 2 lacks the depth of the first film and play a bit too safe. While Into the Spider-Verse looks and feels unique and different from other animated films from this decade. This movie is 11/10, hands down THE best comic book movie I've seen since The Dark Knight.. This is worth buying."
"ultraomegaoverwatch","8","1","2","7 September 2019"," Arguably the best Spider-Man movie, to date.

"Servillas","8","1","2","28 August 2019"," Best animated movie I have ever watched
","I have been waiting to see Spider-Man: Into The Spider-verse for so long and I was so bummed that when they announced a Netflix release date, it turned out to be the US release. But this week it finally released on Dutch Netflix! I felt like a little girl getting so excited about a movie. And I was not surprised that I absolutely loved it!<br/><br/>Off all the Marvel heroes, Spider-man is definitely one of my faves. Spider-man is so different from the others, he is still young and learning and not so damn serious as the rest. He is also different in his super powers. While others rely on their strength or a form of magic (or both, like Thor), Spidey relies on his agility. Sure, he is strong too, but he doesn't beat badguys by punching them really hard.
In this movie, we meet a few alternate universe Spider-people. One of them is Miles Morales, a teenager who looks up to Spider-Man and gets bitten by a radio active spider. (Yes, he too.) He lives in an alternate version of 'our' world and is joined by Spider-people from 5 other dimensions. They are all just amazing. Each has their own personality and motivation to do what they do. But I really love how Miles deals with the whole situation and how his character develops throughout the movie. Long story short, I absolutely adore this version of Miles Morales and we need more protagonists like him!<br/><br/>Watching this movie, I fell in love with the animation style. I heard from others it was good and I saw a teaser pretty early, but I had no idea how gorgeous it looked. It looks like they animated a comic book in a modern coat with amazing colouring.
As the movie is animated, the makers of Into The Spider-verse were able to include more visuals compared to regular movies. My favourite example of that is how they made a visual for everyone's Spider-sense. It's such a small thing, but it added so much to the movie. There's more like this, but I don't want to spoil.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved how the makers of this movie took at how many Spider-Man reboots there have been made. I am not gonna tell you how, but it's hilarious. Oh, and don't forget to watch the after-credits scene!<br/><br/>I really recommend this movie, even for people that aren't really that much of a fan of Marvel. It's such an easy watch with a great story line and it's a fun watch for young and old. It is by far my favourite animated movie and I think it's even better than tons of non-animated ones."

"dannyloeper","9","1","2","22 July 2019"," Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (9.6) (96%) - Simply Brilliant
","<ul><li>This Spider-Man movie is unlike all others, exploring a world we're there are more than one individual that has been giving these powers from radioactive spiders. We follow Miles, a young kid who has in fact been bitten and slowly learns that he is just like his idol, Peter Parker. Miles has to deal with a couple of conflicts this movie. Hiding his powers from his Spider-Man hating cop dad, learning this new found abilities, saving his dimension and others from KingPin, and dealing with an loving uncle that is also working for the bad guy. A lot of these can be considered cliches, but this movie stands out from the rest, especially from and animation standpoint.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>This animation does something that most others don't, and that's balancing aspects that make a movie good. This movie is so funny, and has a such unique sense of humor. There is a scene where miles throws a bagel at a bad scientist, and when it hits him a text comes up. This text just says ""bagel"" above his head, and it made me laugh so hard! The comic book feel of hand drawn animation is so perfect, and the most brilliant thing is in the frames themselves. While Miles is learning to hone his powers, he is quite bad when it comes to web slinging and using his abilities. This being taken into consideration, he is a lot slower than Peter. The animators didn't only show him falling behind, but actually animated him at 12fps instead of the normal 24. This not only gives a sort of slow feeling to Miles, but as the movie progresses he gets faster and faster, eventually getting to 24 frames.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Just a glorious movie, treat yourself to it if you have not yet!</li></ul>"

"bwasman-30723","10","1","2","15 July 2019"," Believe the hype
","When I first saw this movie announced, I was skeptical. And by skeptical I mean I didn't care at all and forgot about it. But boy was I wrong. I love spidey but don't really care about the MCU, and this sure is a treat for any Spider-Man fan. Firstly, and most importantly, this movie has absolutely some of the finest, most impressive visuals I have ever seen in an animated film. There are tons of different art styles on display and it's a barrage of swirling color and sharp animation work. The character design is flawless - from the various spider-people to the excellent Doc Ock (who's a woman), Kingpin, and my personal favorite, the prowler. Speaking of The Prowler, who is by far the best character in the film, the scenes he's in are mostly intense, large scale chase scenes (there's an excellent homage to The Dark Knight when he gets on his motorcycle) and he is an intimidating and genuinely menacing character (although so is this Kingpin).
Also speaking of Prowler, the score and soundtrack to this movie are excellent. You've probably heard the soundtrack, consisting of great rap songs by some of the biggest names in the game right now. But the score is the unsung hero, specifically the sound design used for Prowler's scenes. Here, a sampled elephant call is warped and twisted into a ridiculously cool and terrifying sound that plays whenever Prowler is near. It's amazing at all other parts too, don't get me wrong, this is just the clear highlight.
The plot is immediately engrossing, incredibly emotional, and very, very well written, from the screenplay to the clever dialogue. I'm a huge horror movie fan who almost exclusively watches horror movies, but this movie is just absolutely stunning. My ONLY complaint is that I wish Prowler got more screen time."
"jamescraiguk","9","1","2","10 July 2019"," Just brilliant in so many ways
","Whatever way one chooses to judge SMITSV (as no one is calling it), it holds up incredibly well.<br/><br/>In terms of production and direction, it is superb; the artistic choices are on point, with each Spider-person unique in their design and execution, with the voice cast making their character as individual and essential as those who draw/render them. And these characters are placed in a world that feels ripped straight from the pages of a comic. The characters and their environment are tight, but accessible; there is no flab here.<br/><br/>The cinematography is first class and the editing jaunts between fluent and seamless to jarring and obvious, to great effect. I've seen this in both 2D and 3D, and this is the only film I've ever seen that I preferred the 3D version; that is not to say the 2D version is inferior, only that the production team really got this right in the 3D version.<br/><br/>Finally, hats off to the sound department. Bravo! From the off, this sprawling soundtrack is mixed and scratched together with imperfect precision to compliment what's on screen and is littered with effects to add garish colour to an already kaleidoscopic soundscape.<br/><br/>Up there with the very best in the superhero genre and a game changer in terms of animation, well deserving of its Oscar."

That's an incredible feat for a movie that's anything but grounded in real life -- packed with inter-dimensional spider-people looking to close a portal across worlds.<br/><br/>If I could give this movie an 11/10 I would because it's flawlessly executed.

"akaankshdr","9","1","2","3 June 2019"," Marvel Animation at it's best
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse is an amalgam of good animation, comedy and emotions beautifully delivered with the power of friendship and togetherness being superior to everything else.
The movie has a simple story line where multiple, parallel universes collide and the writers take good use of this by writing enthralling character arcs which give out a simple message, 'That person who helps others simply because it should or must be done, and because it is the right thing to do, is indeed without a doubt, a real superhero.'
The great aspect of this film is how it builds an emotional relationship with very less screen time. For example, the protagonist Miles and his Uncle Aaron hardly share a few scenes together yet one can understand the emotions they share for each other with just a single scene. So is the relationship of Peni Parker and her father, they don't even talk to each other but still, the emotions are justified.
The actions scenes were amazingly well done. The finale was great and a sequel is undeniable."

However, nothing prepared me for this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Beautiful, captivating, and emotional, all the elements that make an amazing animated film, and a wonderful Spider-Man story that hasn't been told yet. It is definitely a film that is worthy of it's Oscar win (finally) it's creative and different, yet feels familiar, and tugs on the heartstrings. I have no doubt Stan Lee is/was proud of this work."

Its utterly stylish with great character designs, comic book aesthetics, and great use of colors. The score is fantastic. The villains are scary. Did I mention it's a fantastic origin story? Newcomers to characters like Miles Morales and Spider-Gwen have a lot to enjoy with their portrayal here. That said, the older Peter Parker is extremely likable as well and shows that our original Spider-Man will always be relevant.<br/><br/>Every element the film displays has a purpose, whether it be establishing character motivations or setting up for the climax' culmination of plot points. This film is masterfully crafted in writing, storytelling, characterization, visuals, and sound. It truly is passionate about Spider-Man, and sharing the integral message that Spider-Man has to share: Anyone can wear the mask. Anyone can be a hero. Anyone can be Spider-Man."

Multiple spider-men all wind up in the same universe because some guy ""Kingpin"" is trying to get his family back and they all have to team up in order to get back to their own universe before they basically disintegrate.

"Nathan_Needs_A_Username","10","1","2","6 April 2019"," Movie Review: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
","Well the biggest surprise of the year appears to be that the Sony Animation release where John Mulaney voices a talking pig is one of the best films of 2018!<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is an incredibly unique film showcasing fantastic animation that gives the film a look that will always be associated with this project. Introducing comic book elements into the film only to switch it up further by incorporating different animation techniques on top of each other later in the film.<br/><br/>As a comic book fan it is really cool to see underappreciated characters treated with such respect in a big film like this. Cage and Mulaney both do a fantastic job playing two of the more comic relief characters in the film while still managing to showcase what makes those characters interesting. This film follows the character of Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) a fan favourite but often overlooked character in the Spider-Man cannon. Despite most audiences not being familiar with the character the care and commitment to getting him right is commendable.<br/><br/>Really that's what this film is all about, care and commitment. Sony Animations doing a Spider-Man film with bankable stars like Hailee Steinfeld and Jake Johnson was always guaranteed to make money but this film goes above and beyond to ensure that it offers a new experience.<br/><br/>I realise that the way I'm talking about this film makes it sound like an ""important"" film that is more art project than family fun but that could not be further from the truth. Into the Spider-Verse is hilarious. This film has a writing credit from Phil Lord one half of the team behind the Jump Street films and the Lego Movie and it shows. I can't remember a single joke that didn't land and much like with The Lego Movie even scenes that don't feature as many jokes are still very engaging and entertaining.<br/><br/>In sort: See this movie! (and stay for the end credits!)"
"degisa","9","1","2","6 April 2019"," A good movie, that maybe over indulges in comedy

I gave it a shot as a Spiderman fan but it doesn't do it for me. Spider Gwen? What the hell..really? And that hood out fit with the shorts was lame and ghetto for a super hero. Bonus powers? yeah, I don't think so buddy. This movie is for little kids but not hard core Spider-man fans. I'm sure they're going to start doing this with other characters now, Yeah no, that's really stupid. This whole concept was stolen from The Flash with a marvel spin to it. I didn't even like how crusty Peter Parker was looking in this cartoon either. This is an actual review somebody left, the amount of idiocy in this review is astounding. spider-Gwen and miles have existed for years now, both being in the main marvel universe now. so ""real Spider-man"" man think before you say idiotic things like this. Also the spider-verse was an event in marvel comics in 2014 it was not inspired by the flash TV show, don't really know how you could enjoy that but hate this."
"kirbylee70-599-526179","10","1","2","4 April 2019"," WHO IS MILES MORALES?
","Longtime fans of Spider-man make up an outrageously large number of people in this world. The box office results for every Spider-man movie have proven that as well as the longevity of the comic book series. But the less than die-hard fans aren't familiar with the name Miles Morales when it comes to the character. They grew up with Peter Parker in comics, cartoons, TV series and movies. So who is Miles Morales?<br/><br/>In 2011 Marvel comics came up with an innovative plan. They were going to relaunch their mainstay comics into a new universe called the Ultimate Marvel universe. They wouldn't get rid of the ongoing series but would create this new one for young readers just coming into comics at the time. This would mean they would have their own Marvel heroes without the baggage of decades of stories to catch up on. These new series were a success and among them was a new Spider-man, Miles Morales. It was inevitable that he would show up on film and SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDERVERSE offers a fantastic introduction to the character as well as bringing in the classic.<br/><br/>The film takes place in this new Marvel universe where young Miles Morales lives. His father Jefferson Davis is a police officer who isn't keen on Spider-man. Miles dreams of becoming a graffiti artist. While his father isn't keen on the idea his Uncle Aaron is and takes him to an abandoned subway tunnel to use as his canvas. While there Miles is bitten by the inevitable radioactive spider and the following day he begins to show signs of his spider powers.<br/><br/>Returning to the tunnel to find out what happened to him, Miles discovers that Wilson Fisk has created an accelerator that will allow him to move through different dimensions, his goal being to reunite with his wife and daughter, killed in a car crash while he was escaping from Spider-man. But Spider-man is there to stop him, fighting his henchmen Green Goblin and Prowler. Miles has to step in to help and the original Spider-man (at least here) is killed but not before he gives Miles a USB device and tells him to use it to stop Fisk.<br/><br/>After the funeral of Spider-man, Miles buys a costume of the hero and tries to use his powers. At the graveside he runs into someone else there to pay his respects who seems like a bum. This is Peter Parker (our Spider-man) whose been brought over from his dimension. After being chased by the police, Miles and Peter begin talking. Peter agrees to help train Miles while at the same time attempting to get himself in shape again. But they aren't alone.<br/><br/>It appears the accelerator while turned on for a small amount of time not only brought Peter here but several other versions of Spider-man from various other dimensions as well. Now this group of heroes, alternate versions of the same character from different dimensions, must unite to fix the dimensional portal that Fisk has created, get themselves back to their own worlds and close the door behind them never to be used again. Easier said than done.<br/><br/>The movie is an amazing thing to watch visually, done in computer animation with such skill that within moments you're not aware you're watching an animated film. The story is so engaging that it doesn't matter. It's a solid film that stands on its own as a movie without thinking about it being animated. This might be why the film won the Oscar this year for best animated movie.<br/><br/>That depth of story is what makes it so exceptional. We have the usual tale of the secret identity issues that our hero faces as well as the loss that he experiences along the way. Even more so when we learn there are different versions of Spider-man that have all had their share of tragedy. Add to that the fact that this hero isn't a well-trained adult but a teenager learning to cope not only with his powers but life itself and what we have is a well-crafted tale.<br/><br/>I may have spoken too soon by saying you'll get so lost in the story you'll forget it's animated because the animation here is amazing. Not only are the standard scenes of going to class with Miles well done but the chase sequences are a visual feast. Add to that the battle sequences and this is one amazing film.<br/><br/>Don't think of this as a kid's film, even though kids will love it. Think of it as a movie that the whole family can enjoy together. Why? Because that's exactly who will have fun watching this one."

Not only is this a fantastic story w/ brilliant artwork through the film, it's got every element needed to be solid & well rounded.
The animation & comic-style integration is absolutely phenomenal!
The team that made this, truly made something original & mind blowingly beautiful!<br/><br/>Also, I love that Miles is a graffiti writer!
Being an artist myself & having roots in that culture, I always notice when movies get it wrong!
They rarely get it right...
They did w/ this, it's totally on point.<br/><br/>This is a must see for anyone, regardless of comic-book knowledge!
Honestly I do watch anime & other animated shows & movies; but generally not ""comic"" animations.. I may have to change that.
Marvel, my personal favorite when it comes to movies, is killing it these days. I've seen everything a million times, but I had no idea the lengths they'd go to on this animated Spiderman."

","Within minutes of watching this film, you realize you are experiencing something new. We've been inundated with Spider-Man movies over the last years and while they have become successively better, they all still rely upon the same origin cannon. This film, for a small
Instant, makes you think it does too but then explodes with originality. It does so in an important way, championing diversity and gleefully enjoying a freedom not felt in any other Spider-Man film. This one knows it has to break free and does so - I mean we have multiple different spider people!<br/><br/>And that's just the story. The graphics are what take the film to Oscar level. The animation is bold and blends styles. You watch the film and feel like you are in a comic book with a POW!! I truly watched this movie with the sense that I had not seen anything like it before."
"elgsdyr","7","1","2","22 March 2019"," Mediocre story with creative visuals
","The strong point of this animated movie is definitely its fairly creative visual style but other than that it had nothing we haven't seen quite a few times before.

There are a couple scenes i felt to drag a bit, for example the scene when Miles was trying to evade the cops while dragging Peter it could have ended a bit sooner. I also feel that there could have been some better character development for everyone, because by the end of the film it felt like all the characters changed but we didnt see much of how.

I cannot wait for the next part of this film."
"AhmedSpielberg99","8","1","2","14 March 2019"," A Must-See Comic-Book!
","Every single trailer that was released for this movie stunned me, largely due to the staggering comics-inspired visuals. But I was trying as hard as I could to lower my expectations for the movie, as I was quite possibly sure that a movie with many ""spider people"" in it like this would be a total mess. The reviews came out calling the movie one of, if not the greatest Spider-Man movie ever made! I was still has my same worries; but I was so glad it gained such awesome reviews, for I really had thought the movie would be a critical failure. (I mean, It's produced by Sony Pictures Animation after all!)<br/><br/>First things first, the eye-popping visuals I've seen a glimpse of from the trailers didn't disappoint. As a matter of fact, the animation looks even better than I expected it to be. The insanely inventive visual style of this movie is unlike any other film ever made; It's simply groundbreaking! Plus, the movie could have easily felt more self-indulgent than clever due to the eye-poppingly opulent visual style that embraces the aesthetics of its comic-book roots; but the movie's substance is as much as it's style. The action set-pieces are quite staggering and innovatively designed; those of Incredibles 2 really pale in comparison to what I found in this movie! But the quick-frame animation also does something spectacular for the action sequences. It made the action looks pretty fast and uniquely slick.<br/><br/>While the movie's unique aesthetic was the thing that made me interested in watching the movie in the first place; the thing that amazed me is the unorthodox and unprecedented way the movie captured the anxiety and panic of gaining superpowers and becoming a superhero. I know it seems weird and quite silly when I say that I felt that I was feeling what Miles Morales felt when he discovered that he became a superhero for the first time! The movie shows us how ""With great power comes great responsibility"" instead of making us hear it over and over. Of course, the visuals added a lot to this point in particular; but it's Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman's astute and extremely clever script that made Morales a fully-fledged, and quite relatable character by putting him in both internal and external conflict. Nothing feels exceptional or new in the character's arc, and you could easily sense the familiarity of the phases our protagonist go through; but the innovative storytelling that enriches the plot as well as the main character made up for that. Although they are not fully-developed and fleshed-out as much as I hoped; The other ""spider people"", are utilized quite well, they fit perfectly in the story, and every single one of them has their own personality, its own character, and that made each one of them adds something different to the humor of the movie, which is, by the way, quite brilliant! That's more than enough for me, especially since the overabundant storylines and characters were my biggest concerns about this movie before watching it. They could have hampered the narrative and made the movie a complete mess like I had expected; but they didn't, and everything was surprisingly cohesive.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that the subtle humor played an important in making the storylines feel coherent; but the unparalleled realization of the idea of... well, the parallel worlds and the multiverse is really the thing that glued all the different sub-plots and storylines together, and made what seems implausible on paper quite compelling and cogent.<br/><br/>The villain, Kingpin is, sadly, the worst thing in this movie. His character is underutilized, underdeveloped, and kinda dumb and stupid! It's really disappointing, as Netflix's Daredevil's Kingpin is one of my favorite comic-book villains I've ever seen being depicted on screen. Besides that I already knew his background very well, the movie did nothing but giving us every once in a while a glimpse or a peak of Kingpin's back-story, and hence his motivations, and this was very perfunctory, especially for those who introduced to this character for the first time. Adding insult to injury, the short scenes that concern Kingpin are scattered and annoyingly intrusive. The fact that Kingpin is quite brainless is totally out-of-place. I mean, the movie is way too smart and clever to have a villain like this that kept giving the protagonist enough time to defeat him until the very end!<br/><br/>Overall, Miles Morales has an unforgettable big-screen debut thanks to a compelling adventure story with innovative and clever storytelling, ground-breaking (and hopefully revolutionary) striking visuals and risk-taking animation style, and strong vocal performances from the entire cast. The well-deserved Oscar winner, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is hands down the best animated movie of 2018!<br/><br/>(8.5/10)"

Utilizing a never before seen style of animation which compliments the movie's tone and action-packed sequences, writers Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman along with Director Peter Ramsey not only bring laughs, tears and eyes widened by stunning visuals but do so in the form of an emotional rollercoaster with perfect tonal balance, a rather ingenious way of character development and a killer soundtrack and score to top it all off.
Overall, Miles Morales' cinematic debut as Spider-Man was not what most expected if they did so at all but it delivered to what is possibly one of the best superhero movies we have ever seen or will see for a while."

I wasn't overwhelmed but everything about this one was so well done. the jokes were not actually funny but there was no cringe factor like most of the MCU movies. and instead of adding up different spidermans together the creators managed to put all those internet memes and pop culture into great use. they pulled off the (ready player one) style of using real life references and they added their own touch of making it relatable to the spider verse and even emotional at times. overall the movie is really entertaining and a new take on the spiderman stories without all the already known boring stuff. totally recommended."

I just can't believe how amazing this animated movie is, the combination of 3D and 2D animation along with moderately used CGI is the best formula that will be used by many others in the future, I can guarantee it. The story is beautiful and full with amazing characters that complement each other all the time, nothing feels to rushed or to long and boring. It has a very interesting ending, altho my only issue would be the fact that I wanted a bit more action seen from the heroes that come from the other universes. That would be my verdict."

I'm so glad that Miles Morales was introduced because I've wanted to be him since his debut back in 2008. If you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you do.

The villain, which in my option most important part of a superhero movie was great, he had clear intentions and his character was easy to understand and even have some compassion for. The take on Spider-Man was fresh and interesting and you could really see what shaped him as a character. The supporting characters were honestly well developed and actually had a place in the story. The overall feel of it was the best part, and like the whole comic book vibe was really cool.

"Meta_B","9","1","2","2 March 2019"," If style (and story) were drugs, then this movie would be substance abuse
","The superhero movie that came out of nowhere but took us on quite a journey.<br/><br/>As someone who grew up at the very beginning of the superhero craze, I've been exposed to many versions of our favorite comic book friends. I was never much of a comic book junkie, but I have seen the highs and lows of Marvel's mainstay heroes and this film manages to show us Spider-man at his best and worst with equal respects.
In regards to story, its your standard Spider-man affair, young man has to learn to adapt and succeed in a new, hostile environment despite his own personal obstacles and his donning the mask of the NYC-webslinger only turns his problems up a notch. Although this formula is by no means a bad one, once you see a superhero movie this expectation can ruin a bit of the magic but if there's one thing I've learned since hearing about the film nearly a year ago, it's that great expectations typically push great people to their destinies. And before this movie, the name Miles Morales was only one I heard in passing during the Spider-man videogames or in the few comics I've read and heard about. But after taking a walk in the red and black Nikes, I can easily see how many people have latched him as a character.<br/><br/>I regretfully admit this is not a thorough analysis of the film, simply because the memories are fresh in my mind and to try to put my awe into words in this moment is proving beyond difficult.<br/><br/>If I were to give a critique of the film as I currently see it, star-struck and all, it would be that many of the scenes are beautifully composed and the variety in locations helps make the story feel unique from previous on-screen iterations of the wall-crawler while all of the actors and characters carry a level of charisma to their performances. No one lacked entertaining moments or felt like rehashed ideas from other movies. It doesn't take itself seriously when it matters and some of its best set-pieces also coincide with its strongest emotional beats. This movie wears its influences on its sleeve and the style of animation is breath-taking. A perfect marriage of comic book op-art stylings with modern animation. Some environments look straight out of a Behance artist's portfolio.<br/><br/>Despite a story that doesn't break new ground, it manages to still share new perspective to the classic Spider-man narrative of self-actualization and it earns its respect."

"Coolaj56","8","1","2","28 February 2019"," Immensely fun & beautiful, with some frustrating flaws
","<ul><li>This review contains very minor spoilers</li></ul>This is an immensely fun and beautiful film. The main characters (Miles, Peter B. Parker, and Gwen) were generally well-developed. And the relationships and banter between that crew was genuinely interesting.
However, the plot ran into some issues. The main villain, Kingpin, for example does have decent motivations that are eventually explained, but he never feels like a real person, largely due to his exaggerated physical appearance. And so the conflicts with Kingpin rarely feel like genuine conflicts, but rather these are forces that are in opposition because it is demanded by the script.
Similarly, 3 of the spider-people (Peni, Noir, & Ham) are under-developed. They are funny, entertaining characters that are pleasing to watch, but because there are so many characters in this film, there simply isn't time to develop all of them and the movie suffers as a result. For example, there is an emotional moment near the end regarding Peni that doesn't work well because her character wasn't built-up enough for that emotional pay-off to work. The result is that the moment feels hollow and insincere, breaking up the pace of the action scene it interrupts. I really like these 3 and I'd like to see more of them, but to bring them into the film all at once and then not develop them or give them true character arcs, makes them feel under-utilized.
Spider-verse is still a very entertaining experience and most of the film succeeds, but it is a bit disappointing to me that what Sony Animation built here is a platform for an amazing film with great performances and gorgeous art-style, but the final film is only very good, and doesn't quite live up to it's potential. I think this film was bit too ambitious, trying to bring in a large crew of heroes and multiple villains, and too many of those pieces were just not properly developed.
The final result is a film that varies from a 7 to a 9 out of 10 throughout its runtime, as it's held back by the aforementioned flaws. And so my final score is a 8/10."
"uptownvandal","10","1","2","28 February 2019"," A plot of had no business working

This is the new frontier into animated movies.<br/><br/>Everything was great about this movie, voices, sound design, sound fx, musics, editing, 3D animations blended with 2D, super-realistic combined with semi-realistic and even cartoonish, storytelling, dialogue, absolutely everything.<br/><br/>There is not a moral and something to remember so much as in the Pixar movies, but it was certainly an incredible entertainment from start to finish."
"ScreenRanker","7","1","2","27 February 2019"," 7.4 - Now listen up, because I have watched a LOT of animated movies.
","This movie started off fine. What I noticed was that the humour was probably intended for people under the age of 16, because I just ignored the unfunny with this movie. I liked the animation style (which is pretty much the same style throughout the movie, with extra junk added in), but I found the story cheesy. There was a basic theme about trusting yourself throughout. Isn't that what you get from Disney Junior?<br/><br/>I liked the movie. But by the end of it I was becoming a bit tired of the story and characters (and it's not just because it was long for an animated movie). Great movies don't do that.<br/><br/>I'm a DC fan. Regardless, I have enjoyed some of the recent Marvel movies. But this movie... I'd heard it was good and it is currently rated 8.6/10 here; the 21st best movie in the world, according to imdb. I mean how is it possibly beating Interstellar?<br/><br/>Whatever.<br/><br/>It's good, but not great. In conclusion, I think that this movie was intended for children. Maybe you are thinking ""Well, duh"", but all of my 18-year-old friends loved it, so I guess that's what's leaving me confused. If you want good cartoon movies, see Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, or Under the Red Hood."
"kaydentullett","8","1","2","27 February 2019"," The best film of 2018!
","This was definitely the best movie of 2018! The characters, voice actors, setting, animation and cinematography are all executed excellently. I was a little worried about having a black spider-man with a black family - and hear me out!- I was just worried that the developers were going to use Myles' skin colour as a way of punching in the face with a Spider-man-should-be-black-because-we-want-him-to attitude, that is all.
Myles is the perfect embodiment of a relatable teenager for those who watched in the theatres or at home. He has elements any teenager could relate to: loss, school, the struggle to make friends, father issues. Yeah, he's a convincing super-hero, but his issues in life are something that any teenager can empathise with, no matter which element of Myles needs to be plucked out.
The rest of the alternative Spider-man characters - well - I was nervous about them, too. An anime spider-woman? A Spider-Woman? A Spider-Pork?! I was nervous. However, this film doesn't treat its audiences like idiots. Furthermore, the characters were immensely likeable, and whether you enjoy watching anime, or have grown out of cartoons, you will feel a lot of enthusiasm towards these alternative spider heroes. And, thankfully, they didn't abuse Spider-Woman's character by stocking her as the being-a-spider-woman-is-so-difficult position.
Moreover, some of the villains were underwhelming for me (except for our new Doctor Octopus). Though, when it came to Kingpin, I have never admired his character as much as I do now. His portrayal in this film had me feeling apologetic for him (you'll have to watch to understand) and his motives have never been as clear to me as they are now.
I'm not a big fan of the rap genre or any of its sub-genres. However, I'm going to be realistic and say that the music in this was hammered down to perfection! When music, of any genre, is added to films they need to be delivered right. Into The Spider-Verse does this without a doubt. No matter the situation, the music was manufactured to work in each situation; sad, irritable, happy and exciting moments.
The animation is extremely inspiring and will have a colossal effect on the beauty you want to see. Night, day and danger, in this film, are all carefully fabricated into a style and theme of appeal. Even the fight scenes between the characters are designed excitedly. And, overall, the animation in this film is unique and nothing I've personally observed before.
Anyone who wants to remember and honor Stan Lee's memory, get inspired, understand themselves and gain motivation, this is the movie to watch. And hell, you may even want to animate as your dream career. After all, this movie is motivationally thought-changing."
"hiepph","9","1","2","27 February 2019"," Awesome spider-gang
","Spider-man has always been my favorite superhero. And seeing many spider... people in a movie like this really spark me joy.
Not being constrained by some motive super heroes but a diverse set of characters and different render (anime, noir, cartoon, etc.) is a notable point. This animated choice does not just gave viewers an interesting experience but also brough this movie an Oscar (2019) for ""Best Animated Feature"".

","I absolutely loved this movie.<br/><br/>I didn't see an animation that great in years. The visual effects are complete madness. It's beautiful, colourful, and it perfectly fits the story.<br/><br/>The movie, in my sense, is the best movie using Comics books codes. I mean the way cases are cut becomes a split screen, the movie also pauses to make some static ""splashy"" effects,
we also get some ""Ouch"" ""Paf"" classic Comics sounds, and everything is made with a lot of taste, a lot of patience. The movie lasts two hours and it's a fast-driven, amazing ride.
Two hours of clever animation like this is just insane. I can't imagine the amount of work this required.
So yeah this movie should be even greater if you can watch in IMAX (is 3D available ?) Go for it !<br/><br/>Now, the story...is also good ! Even the story is decent and the characters are relatable, funny, interesting, this movie really have everything.
I just feel like the ""Spider Pig"" is too much and this could have worked with 4 characters. Maybe this was for entertaining younger audiences.
Basically The mutliverse has a leak here on Earth so other Spiderman went by and this has to be repaired. The interaction between different Spidermen makes them ally against a greater evil and it's well crafted.
Not 10/10 because the story could have been more interesting. Classic ""Superhero against evil"" type.<br/><br/>The Spidermen from other dimensions are really fun and I especially like Spider Noir and Spider Gwen.
I wasn't expecting this kind of movie at all.

"filmexperienced","7","1","2","24 January 2019"," Arachnophobia
","A technical marvel, with lush animation that is unlike anything put on the screen previously - Spider-verse is an overwhelming stew of excess that throws so much at the screen it's sometimes hard to tell what sticks - and which part of it to look at. There are so many characters, so much emotion and so many quick fire gags both in the script and on the screen that a re-watch is surely a must to help put things into perspective. At first glance however not enough time was spent on any one plot line or device in order to give it the weight that the emotional stakes needed them to have - for example the primary villain's motivation, Jake Johnson's ageing Spiderman's love life, and particularly Miles Morales complex family problems, control of his powers, and acceptance of his role in the larger world. Slyly aware of its place within the diversifying superhero market, Spider-verse is reverent to the history of the character, both on-screen and off. Ultimately the fact that no one character stands out may be by design, they are all just cyphers to carry the film's true message - that anyone can be a superhero, or maybe that anyone can take something away from a superhero movie if it has this much in it."

Now miles morales it's my favorite Spider-Man, and even this animated peter parker as a secondary character its better than the live action ones, to my point of view.

"magnusmax","8","1","2","17 January 2019"," An Excellently Timed and Executed Spider-Man Movie
","Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse is without a doubt one of the greatest movies of 2018 - and also the freshest and coolest film of the year. As they say: with great love for comic-book origins, comes a great Spider-Man movie. Or somewhere along those lines. Anyhow, the point is, in this criminally undervalued gem of an animation, we can plainly see an undisguised appreciation for the comics and the classic components that comprise the world of Spider-Man. Or worlds. It's no secret that Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, while honing in on the heroic progression of alternate Spider-Man Miles Morales, brings together a number of universes, in which exist different versions of all the characters present in the one we know. Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the brains behind The LEGO Movie and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, have here worked with the three directors (quite unusual in itself) to craft a very unique and unequivocally original take on popular stories stemming from late creators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko (who are saluted by a special credit at the end of the film), tied together by a ground-breaking animation style which hearkens back powerfully to the comic books from where it originated.<br/><br/>First, a word on the fashion of animation used to bring us Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse. According to some sources, the process for developing the delightfully artistic look of the film commenced with roughly a year-long collaboration of the directors with a single animator, establishing the desired aesthetic. In the course of a second year, ten satisfactory seconds of animation were delivered by the production team, from which the rest of animation found its identity and consequently went into a good three years of production, during which the animation crew increased from 60 to 142 by August 2018 - the largest animation team ever assembled at Sony Picture Imageworks for a film. A new technique was used for the production of the movie, incorporating 2D and 3D components, forgoing or adapting industry standards like motion-blur and depth of field, and basing itself on a variable frame rate system. To quote Thrillist, who puts it better than I could: ""The process was so intense that it took about a week and a half to make just two seconds of screen time. Luckily, they built the animation ""on twos,"" which means a new image every second frame, instead of an image every single frame, which gives the movie a jerky, flip-book look that may take a minute to get used to.""
Factors such as these produce something entirely unlike the blanket animation style most audiences are used to from the likes of Pixar and Disney films. Pause on any given frame, and chances are it'll be worthy of hanging on your wall. Co-director Peter Ramsey says he ""(doesn't) know that there's a frame of (the) movie that didn't somehow get touched in some way, shape or form"". In other words, every frame is a work of art. The splashes of dots denoting shades of colour give the impression of the ""printed look"". Speech bubbles pop up at unexpected moments, and action is sometimes interspersed with frames of classic, hand-drawn, comic-book illustrations, and all this fuels the sum feel of the piece, altering it drastically from standard cinema fare.<br/><br/>The story is just as simple as it ought to be, with the focus on the characters taking centre stage. Without advocating a political agenda, diversity is fine (non-forced diversity), and the movie mostly does a fine job of featuring an African-American character without feeling contrived, which is cool. My only qualms with this are some references nearer the start of the film, when I began to fear the worst for the movie's eventual outcome. However, if I did catch any progressive nonsense there, it was slight, and didn't detract very much from the overall product. Similar stereotypical circumstances like the recurrent believe-in-yourself phrase and the son-who-can't-get-on-with-his-father trope were minorly irritating, if only for having been central supports for so many storylines before it. The relationship that develops between the two becomes something that is personally far more hard-hitting, crescendoing to an emotional high later in the film, which is a subject I'll say no more on for risk of spoiling it! A line about a leap of faith provides a nice alternative to more familiar catch-phrases. Generally, the story allows for plenty of character development, particularly for our main star, Miles Morales, and a couple of supporting characters. It's a simple plot, and that benefits and compliments everything else nicely. In fact, there is so much material to mine, I sincerely hope the sequel will carry on and explore the intriguing possibilities this first instalment began. Some of those intricacies were perhaps a little unrealised, in my opinion, and certainly some characters were sidelined by reason of the modest run-time and the priority of the story; so a sequel is hardly an overload. More than anything, the movie is just a really fun ride, and non-essential details and complications are discouraged from encroaching on simple, super effective storytelling.<br/><br/>And a note on the music. Besides a lovely and fitting score, the movie utilizes for a variety of effects a vast collection of rap, which lends the whole piece a slick if modern mood that may discourage some viewers. The music does at times push out the deeper feelings the audience may otherwise experience with greater potency through the use of a more sentimental score, but most of the time it blends well with the activites ocurring on-screen. In closing, this is a movie I decided rather late in the game to patronize, as I love supporting clever, original cinema, and this particular Sony (of all people?) animation, despite being yet another superhero movie, is a wonder to behold, dispelling any doubt in my mind over the care and creativity of the artists behind it. It reinvents classic concepts and represents them in a completely unique story that is instantly memorable and special. The zany CGI animation gives free reign to the crazier side of comic-book life, enabling the movie to use designs deemed unacceptable or unviable in live-action entertainment and endowing it with a sense of randomness and delightful flippancy - the same and yet different from what has come before it. Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse is a delicious dedication to creators Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, emulating their comic books perfectly and establishing itself as one of the greatest movies of 2018, and one of the weirdest and coolest movies ever."

Into the spider-verse is the 7´th movie of the superhero, it might look at first sight that this only another spider-man movie, it actually isn´t.
The movie tries to do something different, and it achieves really well.The script is great, well written, the movie is actually unpredictable, very funny and moving.
The main character Miles Morales is very relatablle, from the dicullty and uncertainty of being a teen, he´s a great character and easy to root for.
The animation is fantastic, sophisticated, colourful, and it contributes to create spectacular action sequences.It has its own distincive style.
In terms of rhythm moves fast, it doesn´t drag and is very fun.
There weren´t really any negative aspects, just minnor things, there was one character here, that i wish it could have been more explored, and a villain that was just decent.
Spider Man Into the Spider-Verse its a creative, exciting, funny, profound and visually stunning movie. The best Spider-Man movie to date, and one of the best super-hero movies this past years.<br/><br/>8.4/10"

Obviously the visuals were quite original with the comic-book-meets-CGI animation but they weren't distracting and fit the flow of the story quite well. A beautifully written script went hand-in-hand with the characters and their personalities producing some great laughs and moments that pulled at you.

When entering the cinema there was even a warning displayed that there is a scene in the movie that might be unsuitable for visually sensitive people. And indeed it is very flashy and colorful at times. In addition to that in some wide angle shots the surroundings seem to be very blurry and in hectic scenes it felt like there were framerate problems, the movements felt very abrupt. Those details made it overall quite exhausting to watch for me although I enjoyed it."
"mattr1198","10","1","2","1 January 2019"," A Revelation for American Animation and the Superhero Genre
","For those who are saying either American CG animated films are beginning to look stale in appearance or that the superhero movie genre is getting redundant/safe (like me), Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is huge a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>First, I understand the animation may not be for everyone, but for me I thought it was great in its uniqueness and style. Nothing has ever looked like this film before. If you compare characters from different animation studios, some people can't tell the difference between a Dreamworks character model and a Pixar character model. This looks nothing like anything from any animated movie before and it looks even better in the context that this is a comic book movie with many comic book references spread throughout. To put it bluntly, Phil Lord and Chris Miller are at the forefront of innovation in US-based animation, with this and The Lego Movie revolutionizing modern animation as we know it.<br/><br/>Second, no story like this has ever been attempted in a superhero flick before, with the closest thing being time travel in X-Men: Days of Future Past back in 2014 (another fantastic superhero movie). All of the characters in the spider-verse are amazingly unique in their fighting styles, animation, and personalities. They actually feel like wildly different characters from the main character, Miles Morales.<br/><br/>Third, Miles Morales' journey as Spider-Man is wildly different in its development, from the development of his personality, charm, and his relationships with everyone he meets. It flips the spider-man story on its head, putting a kind of meta focus more on having to become truly different spider-man from his spider-verse counterparts.<br/><br/>On top of all of this, I loved the humor (especially meta-humor), the voice actors, and the overall adventure is engaging as all hell. My only downside is the villain not being terribly fleshed out and the kingpin not being a very interesting villain in terms of appearance (which they certainly try) or powers. Overall, I was thrilled seeing this movie and I really hope they build on this success even further."

","This movie was fantastically well done script and story wise. The story really can connect with most of the viewers emotionally. The characters shine like never before in a spider man film, you feel for them. You feel there struggle, happiness and pain throughout the whole movie. You feel the atmosphere that they are in every second. This move makes you Feel like you are there. VFX/animation is on point. Without a doubt the best visually stunning movie I have watched all year, along side with other films. The only error that I noticed was probably how the story is kind of all over the place at some points. It just seems like a lot to process for non comic book fans of Spiderman."

","His name is Peter Parker. I'm pretty sure you know the rest. He saved the city, fell in love, then he saved the city again, and again, and again. Look, he's a comic book, a cereal, he did a Christmas album, and a so-so popsicle. But this isn't about him, not anymore.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend Into the Spider-Verse enough, it has quickly become my #1 film in 2018 (possibly one of my favourite films of all time) which I did not think was possible since I never thought anything could surpass Wes Anderson's Isle of Dogs, which I also highly suggest checking out, but the film-making duo and lovers, Phil Lord and Chris Miller along with directors Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman and Bob Persichetti and a talented crew proved that I am indeed a soy boy virgin and created the most fun, entertaining and memorable movie this decade with a unique and stunning art style, groundbreaking animation as well as relatable great characters.<br/><br/>The animation is easily the best aspect of this film, surprisingly the studio behind the Emoji Movie gave us this gift none us deserved. Into the Spider-Verse combines many different art styles (e.g. Spider-Ham's cartoon rubberhose aesthetic, Peni Parker's anime aesthetic, etc.) as well as creative animation which creates the closest experience to a living comic book audiences have ever had. Characters look exactly like they have been pulled out of a comic and the use of text boxes in addition to other features in comics enhances this experience. The style perfectly fits the character of Spider-Man and the action scenes become the greatest scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>The writing is also of a very high standard, it provides a funny as well as serious tone which perfectly suits Spider-Man as well as the film, characters receive many great lines and have engaging dynamics which make them more three dimensional and easier to connect with. All the Spider-Men have unique personalities and quirks which separate them from each other, but it's not just them that are interesting because so are the other characters such as Kingpin and Aunt May. Personally, I wish characters like Noir, Kingpin and a few others had some more screen time and development since I enjoyed them so much but naturally and understandably that couldn't happen since the movie would be far too long and the more critical characters like Miles and Peter required greater attention. (Gwen is still the best character in the film tho)<br/><br/>The story whilst enjoyable with great execution is quite generic but still good nonetheless. I was initially quite surprised about how dark the movie was willing to go, whilst deaths like RIPeter (Blonde Peter. RIPeter was a nickname used by the film artists, thanks Spider-Verse artbook :) ) and Aaron were obvious, the realism was what shocked me, it doesn't go insanely dark, no blood, but still darker than most family friendly films go. The characters and animation is what you will be really coming for."
"gcsman","8","1","2","30 December 2018"," A pyrotechnical must-see for Marvel fans
","This is a fun, dazzling ride, no doubt at all. It's a Superhero Origin Story (young Miles Morales gets the radioactive-spider bite, but with some different results than we were expecting), an alternate-universes story (several Spideys from different universes all piled together), and a warm-hearted family drama (Miles learns his favorite uncle isn't to be admired after all, and snaps back to realizing how good his parents are after all). And it's an ultra-dazzling CGI display with style to burn. I came out of the theater with the feeling that I'd been immersed in an actual comic book for 2 hours. There's clever use of visible word balloons and sound effects (e.g. 'Thwip!"" appears on the screen as Spidey shoots his webbing) and lots of split-screen action as if you're seeing several panels on a comics page at once.<br/><br/>It's dazzling and innovative by playing to the strength of its chosen medium (animation rather than live-action). The most fun for me was the interaction of the multiple heros. The Spider-Man from the first alternate universe is a middle-aged Peter B. Parker who still has his moves, but who is now overweight, divorced, and jaundiced. Spider-Gwen has a cool black-and-white suit and in action is elegant and balletic. Spider-Man Noir is a hard-boiled PI with a black trench coat (always tossing artistically in a breeze) who talks like he's straight out of a Raymond Chandler novel. Peni Parker, a young anime Japanese girl, has kept HER radioactive spider to help run her robotic Spider-armor. And looniest of all we have Spider-Ham from a kids' cartoon universe (who walks onto camera just as Peter B. Parker finishes saying (""this could literally not get any weirder""). They all have to combine to beat the villains led by the evil Kingpin, who's about the size of an elephant with a piggish head below his shoulders and seems to be about as strong as the Hulk. Although the Spidey comics traditionally had lots of weird villains, unfortunately I thought Kingpin and his crew were kind of overdone even in the context of this movie.<br/><br/>The jokes and situational humor, complete with self-referential in-jokes about Spider-Man's comic book history, come thick and fast. Add to this the riot of special effects and explosions of color during the final scenes and we get something that starts to collapse of its own weight. I had a great time watching it, but in the end it seemed like this movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to be below its dazzling surface. (Not that this doesn't make it worth seeing, though. Yes, it's sheer fun living inside a superhero comic for that two hours.) As for the musical score -- kind of heavy-handed, I thought; we were being pushed into sensory overload.<br/><br/>One thing that I particularly liked was the first-rate cast of actors doing the voices. Shameik Moore has the youthful Miles voice and style down pat, and Hailee Steinfeld is a perfect Gwen (I wanted more). Jake Johnson nails the soft-spoken, world-weary Peter B. Parker persona, Nic Cage pulls off Spider-Man Noir (I wanted more of him too), and the best surprise of all was Lily Tomlin as the best-sounding Aunt Mae I've ever heard (and we've have good ones in the previous live-action Spidey films)."
"isaacj02","8","1","2","30 December 2018"," Stylish and energised; Spider-Man gets a new spin
","Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are known for their penchant for irreverent comedy; 21 Jump Street and The Lego Movie immediately pop to mind with a grin. Here the talented pair, along with Avi Arad and Peter Ramsey, turn their hand to a beloved Marvel item who is no stranger to a reboot; Spider-Man. But, this time we're not being subjected to yet another Uncle Ben death scene; Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse tells the origin story of another Spidey, plucky teen, Miles Morales (an energetic Shameik Moore) as he grapples with the infamous Kingpin (Liev Schreiber), helped by a number of inter-dimensional ""Spider-people""... including a washed-up, cynical Peter Parker (voiced with a nonchalant drawl by Jake Johnson). We watch as Miles grapples with finding his feet after an unfortunate interaction with a radioactive arachnid, in a hearty and humorous adventure, that feels distinctly Lord and Miller.
Into the Spider-Verse is a noticeably different adaptation of the friendly neighbourhood superhero; from the outset, the film cheekily satirises the incessant rebooting of its character (a flashback to a certain Spider-Man 3 moment gives perhaps the biggest laugh). Plenty of fun is poked out of comic-book movie tropes too; this doesn't change the fact however that, plot-wise, Into the Spider-Verse has little to offer in terms of originality, its narrative as predictable as a Saturday morning TV cartoon.
The film almost makes this redundant, however, through a stylish and confident execution, that feels fresh. Lord and Rodney Rothman's script is full of wry humour, quick-witted, yet full of heart and honesty. Miles Morales is also a more fleshed out lead than we are used to from Marvel (despite a slightly easy resolution to his arc) and his band of misfits, whilst largely one-note, are fun enough to carry the film with ease. Brian Tyree Henry and Mahershala Ali are unfeigned as Miles' father and uncle respectively and Jake Johnson is simply brilliant in an incarnation of Peter Parker hitherto undreamt of. An antagonist in the form of Kingpin is more disappointing, a forced motivation leaving him uninteresting and decidedly by-the-numbers. The movie leaves us little time to think on its faults though; it takes a relentless, yet natural, pace through riveting action sequences and comedic montages, with the ease of a web swing.
Into the Spider-Verse's greatest strength, however, is its design. The animation is unique and aesthetic, delightfully reminiscent of an old-school comic strip. The film feels like a very real homage to its source material, the comic in comic book movie always coming first. Into the Spider-Verse won't be remembered for breaking ground in plot and character, but its design alone is enough to make you want to go back for more.
Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have assembled a fun and frenetic film which, whilst standard on paper, is executed with artistry and flair. An incarnation of the world's favourite superhero surely to be remembered."
"ryancarless","10","1","2","29 December 2018"," Anyone can be Spiderman
","Spider Man Into the Spider Verse was a glorious, exciting and well told film. As a fan of the character of Spiderman since the original Raimi films, I can confidently say that this film pays tribute to its co-creators Lee and Ditko, the legacy of Spider Man and even the comic book medium itself. Miles Morales is the 2nd superhero of color this year who proves that anyone under the mask can be a hero. Alongside him is Spider Gwen, a cool but interesting character who also dates back to her original character in the comic. Peter Parker and the rest of these Spider People bring a different and interesting perspective on the character and with genuine comedy, depth and motivations make these characters full of life. This is a stylish, fast paced and well told movie. It's a movie I'd recommend even if you don't know much about Marvel's wall crawler. 10/10."
"mr_bickle_the_pickle","9","1","2","30 December 2018"," A Great Origin for Miles
","This movie is such a delight. Its funny, its heartfelt, theres lots of cool action and theres lots of bright colours. I really loved Miles Morales. I didnt know much about his character going in, but I would totally love to see more of him going forward. Even before the film ""Spider-manned"" I was thoroughly enjoying the movie as a teen comedy. I also liked that they mixed different animation styles together, and that it also felt like a comic book was literally coming to life. It was also shocking, I wasnt expecting the death of a certain character (won't say who). Wilson Fisk/Kingpin wasn't as menacing as he is in the Daredevil TV show, but he was still pretty good. Doc Ock was good too, but I still overall prefer the Doc Ock in Spider-man 2. So even though the villains lacked a little for me it definitely was made up for by the various spider-mans. I loved Miles as I already stated. I thought Jake Johnson was really good as a somewhat bitter Spiderman, John Mulaney as Spider-Ham was funny and surprisingly works in this world, Spider-man Noir was great too and I think Nic Cage was the perfect fit for it, I also really liked Spider-Gwen and would like to see more of her too. Stay through the credits, you a) get a fantastically funny Christmas song as well as a funny after credits scene.<br/><br/>That being said, I felt it didnt make sense that Aaron didnt catch on sooner who Miles really was. He tracks him back to his own apartment for crying out loud. Does he just think thats the biggest coincidence? But I guess thats a small nitpick overall.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film. I think its good for adults, teens and kids. Probably not super young ones though."

In my eyes before this movie, spider man was synonymous with Peter Parker. Miles Morales didn't change that, the writing did. Because, before the movie, I was content calling Miles Spider man #2. This movie helped me realize what spider man is. It's not a person, but rather it's the ideals that make people want to do what is right. Because in the end, we can all be spider man. I am Spider Man.

","Wow. This was a feat on multiple levels.
(1) The animation style - I've never seen anything like it. While it takes a bit getting used to, the animation makes you feel like you're reading a comic book.
(2) The story - My biggest concern going in was how the filmmakers would explain the concept of multiple parallel universes to audiences without bogging down the plot. Somehow...they did it
(3) Honoring Spider-Man - despite none of the spider-people being the Peter Parker shown in other films, there was an element to each character that made one feel that they were, indeed a Spider-person. The cameos and references to Spider-Man canon made the film especially fun for longtime fans.
(4) A Good Movie - It's a refreshing take on not only Spider-Man, but the superhero genre as a whole. It's got comedy, drama, action and heart.<br/><br/>Lord & Miller have done it again!"

","Reel Nerd Review: Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Directed by: Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman
Starring: Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld, Mahershala Ali, Brian Tyree Henry, Lily Tomlin, Luna Lauren Velez
An animated Spider-verse movie featuring Miles Morales along with other Spider-persons from throughout the multiverse team up to stop a threat that could destroy every parallel reality. There has been a lot of buzz around this film even mentions of an Oscar nomination for best picture not as an animated feature but for the big one. I quite liked the movie but I didn't walk away agreeing with the Oscar talk surrounding this film. Some have even said this may perhaps be the best Spider-Man film ever made and I don't know that I agree with that either.
I am glad that the Miles Morales character is finally getting his time in the spotlight. There have been a contingent of fans calling for a live action film featuring the character but I still think we're a few years away from that happening. Shameik Moore gave one hell of a performance as Miles in fact I was impressed by the voice performances of the entire cast. I was especially impressed by Jake Johnson's performance as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. There were some really great emotional beats and moments in the film especially between Miles and his dad as well as Miles with his uncle.
Even though I did enjoy the film it didn't wow me as I had been expecting it to. Maybe this film was never going to live up to the hype for me but I did enjoy it. One reviewer said this was his favorite comic book film of the year again I would have to disagree for my money it would have to be Aquaman.
The first act dragged a bit for me and the pacing felt a bit off. By the start of the second act onwards things really started to pick up and the story seemed to flow a bit smoother as well. I love the fact that Spider-Ham of all characters was included in this film as his character added a lot of levity to the film that had a couple of dark moments in it but tonally overall I wouldn't call the tone dark it was mostly fun and very emotional.
Stan Lee's cameo got me a bit choked up especially considering the context of the scene in which he was in. I won't spoil it for you here but it was a really beautiful moment. Kingpin is the main big bad in the film but a couple of other notable villains turn up as well but you'll have to see the film to find out who they are.
Lily Tomlin as Aunt May was a delight she did such a great job with the character. Her Aunt May is a very different version than one we've seen before on screen which added a lot more dimension and importance to the character. I definitely would recommend this film if you're a fan of any versions of the versions of Spider-Man and if you stick around for the post credit scene another Spidey yet to be seen on screen makes a cameo."

"EddyTheMartian007","8","3","12","20 December 2018"," A great Spider-Man movie, but it's rushed, with underdeveloped characters.
","Woah this movie was actually really good. Into The Spiderverse follows Miles Morales as he has to stop a machine that is combining dimensions, and becomes the next Spiderman. I gotta say, I was really impressed. The animation is absolutely stunning, and there's a ton of animation jokes. I'm not really gonna talk anymore about the visuals, because that's been said to death, but the movie is just gorgeous. The action was also really engaging, it's all very fast paced, and while it can get weird at times, you can still follow it with ease. For an animated film this movie was surprisingly mature in some moments, and I think that's what makes it great. I mean damn characters actually die, and there are many emotional moments. Also there's themes of divorce, depression, among others. However I don't think this movie is the best Spider-Man movie, or even an amazing movie. I do have to say this movie definitely understands the character of Spider-Man, and I love the theme of everyone can become Spider-Man. My real problem comes with some of the characters. Miles is the only character that gets significant development in the movie, and in the respect it's excellent. Miles has some really great emotional moments and Shameik Moore does a great job voicing him. In fact the whole voice cast does a phenomenal job. However apart from Miles no other character gets significant character development. I mean I get it, this is Miles movie, and they should develop his character the most, but the other characters are really 1 dimensional to me. While all the other alternate dimension Spider-Man were very entertaining, I really don't care about them. The older Spider-Man was done really well though. He does have his own little arc in the movie. He's definitely well developed. You can see he's reluctant to mentor Miles, but he knows it's the right thing, and Miles needs this. Again apart from those characters we get the most basic information of everyone else. Each character just gives their origin, and that's it. We don't know anything else about them. Those scenes were handled very well though, without making them too repetitive, but the other characters barely have anything to them. The same thing unfortunately happens with the villains who are all severely underdeveloped. The only 2 villains we know anything about are KingPin and Prowler. We get KingPin's motivation early on, which was done once again very well, but that's the only thing we know about him. The same thing happens with the prowler, except we don't even know his motivations, he just has a connection to a character. This really hurt the movie for me because while Miles, and the older Peter were well developed, everyone else kinda fell flat for me. They aren't bad, but they just feel like a shell. However characters like Miles' Dad, KingPin, Prowler, and Gwen were good despite this. Now I know that's a significant flaw, but this movie is still great. I'm focusing on the negatives because everything else is so good. Like the soundtrack, which is brilliant. I do think some music choices were odd, but the Prowler's theme is fantastic, and so is most of the score. Also The humor, which is done well. However Another issue I have with the film is it being kinda cliche. I mean removing the Dimensional travel stuff, this is the average coming of age, origin story. For example for most of the movie Miles has no idea how to use his powers, but when he needs it the most he now suddenly, and perfectly knows how to use his powers. Again though it's done very well either way considering this is an extremely fast paced movie, and it does feel rushed sometimes. Also there's some noticeable plot convenience, especially in the 3rd act. I have some other specific issues with the movie, these might be considered minor spoilers so you've been warned. In the beginning it's mentioned how they can't turn on the machine or else it'll end destroying Miles' dimension, however later on in the movie, it changes to letting the other Spidermen enter their dimensions quick enough. Also that part is very convenient. They use, basically a flash drive to stop the device, and that can somehow control which dimensions each character goes too? Anyways my final issue is a very specific one. There's this moment where KingPin shoots a certain character (which was an awesome moment) but it doesn't make sense that he wouldn't shoot Miles too. I mean he probably could've dodged the bullets with his spider-sense, but KingPin doesn't know this, it just didn't make sense. However I do think overall this movie is great. It's very mature for an animated movie, it's animated extremely well, it has great voice actors, it's just great overall.<br/><br/>8.3/10"

This is an animated Spider_Man movie that gives you a look at the different Spider_Men from alternate dimensions-it's also the first animated Marvel movie to be rated 'PG'. Those familiar with the comics know all about these spin off heroes. Shameik plays Miles Morales/Spider_Man, who runs into Jake/Peter Parker/the original Amazing Spider_Man-notice the 'Amazing' in his name? That's how you tell them apart in the books-after Liev/the Kingpin causes a dimensional rift that lets the others visit his world. Hailee/Spider_Gwen and Nicolas/Spider_Man Noir are a couple of the other Spider_Men that make it through the rift. There is also a Japanese Manga robot Spider_Girl and a Spider_Pig. Jake and the others help train Shameik in the use of his new talents-some are a little different than Jakes'-to make him Spider ready. Stan Lee makes his usual cameo and I heard that this was his last voice_acting role. There is a lot of humor throughout the film and it is pretty good-sometimes I had a hard time hearing everything because of the audience laughing so loud. Some of it is even 'nods' to the live action films and tv shows. And make sure you stay after the end credits because there is a nice scene with another Spider_Man not shown earlier.
It's rated ""PG"" for action violence, thematic elements and some mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes.
I am a big Spider_Man fan-Amazing & otherwise-and I really enjoyed this look at the different versions of the beloved hero. I would buy this one on Blu_Ray."

","Well, my 8 year old son liked ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"", hence I eventually caved in and sat down to watch it. I, however, didn't like it.<br/><br/>This 2018 animated foray by Marvel into a mashed-up mixture of Spiderman universes was downright atrocious. The storyline was horribly flawed and just downright idiotic, and it didn't really help that the majority of the alternate Spiderman characters were equally idiotic and misplaced as the storyline itself. I mean, the Manga character and the pig-like Spiderman, seriously? It was just so stupid.<br/><br/>The one thing that ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" had working for it, was the animation style and the art style, which was very reminiscent of the Borderlands games and the Telltale interactive games. But that was also just about all that was working in favor of ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" in my opinion.<br/><br/>Well, at least the voice acting in the movie was good, so let's just be just and say that two things were working in favor of the animated movie. The only voice I recognized, however, was Nicolas Cage. I am surprised to find that Liev Schreiber also voiced a character here.<br/><br/>I actually gave up 25 minutes in because I was fast falling asleep. So I came back the next day to watch the rest of the movie, as my son liked it, so I wanted to check it out with him. But alas, breaking the movie up into two didn't make it an ounce better in any way. This movie was just unfathomably boring and unappealing to me.<br/><br/>So this was Stan Lee's final legacy, his last product to grace the cinema before his death? Well, not really a movie worthy of being a final imprint for a man of his stature. Because this movie was an abomination in every possible aspect.<br/><br/>I managed to sit through it in round 2, but I can in all honesty say that I am never ever returning to watch ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" again, and I will even go as far as saying that it is far worse than any of the live action ""Spiderman"" movies that has been spewed forth by Marvel."

I believe that anyone looking for an easy going, feel good film will certainly be more than satisfied after watching this film."

An average at best film that was rushed through for the holidays."
"nicostudios","9","7","42","11 December 2018"," Review: Does Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse Live Up to the standards? We say yes!
","A few weeks ago, I was confronted with the opportunity to attend an early screening of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse courtesy of Sony. After watching the movie, I found that it had actually succeeded my expectations by a landslide. Right now (December 10th, 2018) there are 95 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes and only one of them is a rotten review; Here at Imagine Studios, we have decided the movie was not only good, but GREAT!<br/><br/>Sony Pictures Animation somehow found a way to combine 3D looking graphics with comics and not completely disorient the viewer. This animation style is so unique and new that I don't think I've ever seen anything like this in any other movie. If you were to look at a single frame picked at random from the movie, it would look like a still image from a comic, but if you put many frames of it together, it seems animated just perfectly enough.<br/><br/>The soundtrack contains many songs from some more... new (let's just say that) artists. Rap music is mixed with cinematic action movie music to create an almost great soundtrack. The new soundtrack seems to be aiming towards younger people who listen to artists like Post Malone. Although the soundtrack could have done without the Rap music in my opinion, it is crucial towards developing Miles Morales as a young adult in the movie. Miles uses Post Malone's song ""Sunflower"" to calm down when he feels stressed out or scared and often times we can see him wearing his headphones and humming along to it.<br/><br/>The movie is full of variety of jokes. Some of them can be understood by everyone, and others can only be understood by us true Marvel's Spider-Man fans. References to other movies and shows are hidden all over the place and they give people a reason to watch it again when it comes out on digital or dvd so they can hunt out all of the little easter eggs.<br/><br/>Regardless of the PG rating, I truly enjoyed this movie. People of all ages would be able to come watch the movie and still feel entertained. The movie's runtime is two hours and to be honest, I would've sat through it if it went on for longer. I wanted to see the Spider-Mans/Women swinging around more, it just gave me that feeling of satisfaction.<br/><br/>The trailers really tricked me; some of the plot elements hit me out of nowhere. I like it when movie studios completely mis-lead you with there trailers and show you something you never saw coming.<br/><br/>All of the characters play a crucial role to the plot and I can't imagine the movie without even one of them. There are many different characters who all play as a father figure to Miles and they help him learn what the true meaning of being Spider-Man, or any hero in that sense, really is.<br/><br/>Once again, thanks to Sony Pictures for inviting me to the early screening of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Thanks for reading my review -Nico."
"vatigue","3","2","7","21 February 2019"," Got motion sickness issues? don't bother.
","Generally, the whole team certainly knows what they're talking about. They even adress and implement stuff that is known from the spider-verse I did really not remember. Here's my two issues with this film though. I was really looking forward to it, mostly hoping for a game-changer in art within the whole franchise.
The stop-motion-trick while doing the whole movie may be a bold animation choice, but turns out to make the whole thing clunky and I cannot figure out why they went for a lower framerate than regular animated movies. To me it just feels off and makes it hard to watch. What brings me to the second issue. I happen to feel motion sickness in certain games that appear to have head bobbling and certain light and brightness effects. So far I couldn't figure out the reason but this movie manages to do the same to me. I had to stop watching 1 hour in due to actually feeling sick just watching a damn movie.
Lot's of people like it. give it a try. I cannot recommend due to motion sickness issues. A clear no to the lower framerate. It was an artistic choice but I clearly don't see the point except for the saving money part. It is creative, sure, but I cannot watch it..."
"snake-96615","8","2","7","15 January 2019"," In no Universe is this the best Spider-Man movie!!
","Anyone thinking that is seriously delusional and might even need help. However the film is immensely entertaining and hilarious. My wife and I watched this with huge grins on our faces. The first hour is superior as we meet Miles and watch him become Spider-Man. It also has the best Spiderman ( the one from Miles own World ). Unfortunately it goes off the rails in the climactic altered reality battle where the animators went haywire loco. It also loses points for the hunchbacked and unnaturally strong Kingpin. The manga and pig Spidermen were also stupid. But just about everything else is spectacular and spot on. Great twist from one of the villains and some shocking deaths. I'd love to see a movie with the first Spider-Man and his ( Alfred ) Aunt May. Overall the movie delivers and the high praise is well deserved!!"
"gabutidze","8","2","7","1 January 2019"," What year is it again?

"hiraishinnojutsu","8","2","7","17 December 2018"," Much better than most (if not all) of Spidey's live action movies
","Almost everybody says it's perfect, yes they're right, it is perfect!! Unfortunately, I'm not a huge Spidey fan, so that rating I just gave might get a little bit biased, but it's still great, fun, funny, cool, and unique. Not to mention the deep message it carries throughout the film: being a Spider-man doesn't mean one is the strongest and the most perfect being of all time, the persistence, standing up for what you believe what is right despite the odds of winning, rising up no matter how many times one got punched, no matter how strong those punches are, no matter how fall or hard you fall, is what makes you a Spider-man, or Spider-woman if you're a woman (and of course the web slinging thing).<br/><br/>Miles Morales learned all of this the way Peter did. Struggling as a teenager in a new place that seem to be cold and despise human uniqueness, Miles gains new allies and friends alike the way he never imagined, not even in his wildest dreams and thought. But he also finds betrayal and loss that would scar him for life.<br/><br/>Overall I put Spider-verse on par with this year's The Incredibles 2: fun, family and kids friendly, rooted with a deep message about family and finding acceptance in the world that doesn't seem to need or care about you. Big Hero 6 is another one this movie reminds me of (well it's not that important but, the similarities is kind of compelling to me). So far, if Sony can keep this good trend of Spidey cartoon movies into their next projects and beyond, we would definitely be entertained by wave after wave of over-the-top spin-offs or solo movies from the characters of the Spider-verse (Spider-gwen? Spider-woman? Spider-noir? Spider-ham? Everyone?)"
"AnishMisra","9","3","13","15 December 2018"," Into the Spider-Verse Review
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider Verse is a film directed by Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman. The trailers of the film excited me a lot (Of Course, its Spidey!) and I anticipated this film for a long time. After seeing it today, I was satisfied.<br/><br/>Plot: Miles Morales teams up with Spider Men and Women of different universes to take down Kingpin.<br/><br/>Story and direction: Spider Man is very close to my heart and ever since I have watched the 90's cartoon I am just a fan of this character. And this film exactly does that. It shows respect for both the character and the audience who has been loving the character for almost now 50 years. The story is engrossing and connects you instantly. You see every Spider Men/Women is not perfect and that what makes them unique. The family dynamic is very nicely highlighted in the film. You see the characters that are something in the beginning but at the end you feel for every one of them. Each of the Spider Men/Women are likable and by the end of the film I couldn't even decide which one I liked better. They melt your heart in a good way. I did like the animation also. It was closer to the comics which is never seen in any animated films of the recent times. Also liked the way the thought boxes from the comics were introduced, which I never expected. The visual effects and fight sequences are surely a treat to watch. The comedy is spot on. Every joke just made me laugh. The makers even go on and make a joke out of everything we know about Spider-Man without offending us. And lot of it was due to the intelligent writing (Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman). The voice-acting was also great and the casting was just spot-on. The score by Daniel Pemberton too was awesome. The fusion of an action-packed score along with the Afro-American songs was just so cool. If I had to pinpoint one thing that wasn't good it was Kingpin. It seemed like the makers wanted to go for an arc, but they decided not to, which made his character less interesting.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where Jefferson has a heart to heart talk with his son from behind the door and Miles due to the situation he is in can't open the door. I liked the small pep-talk (if that's what it is) that a father has with his son and it inspires Miles and kind of brightens a ray of hope inside him.<br/><br/>Verdict: I may place this film on par with the Tobey Maguire series because its' seriously that good. I was mesmerized by each and every aspect of the film. Never for a second, I felt bored or tired from watching the film. The film obviously does have a post credit scene, so will advise you to stay till the end (that is standard for any Marvel Movie). If this film has sequels or spin-offs, I am ready for them, but they better be good. If you are a Spider Man fan I am sure you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>For now, I am going with a 9/10."
"BecauseIAmBATMAN","9","3","13","15 December 2018"," Simply Phenomenal
","Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse is an amazing film. The animation style is phenomenal and its easily one of the best looking animated films ever. It literally feels like a comic book in motion, popping to life. The art and cinematography oozes with style hence there are a lot of amazing action sequences and breathtaking trippy visuals in this film. But its not just merely a visual spectacle. It also is a really heartwarming origin story for a new Spider-Man.<br/><br/>With witty dialog poking fun at superhero tropes and past Spider-man history and visual inventiveness, there is a lot of heart, humour and character development in this film. Miles Morales has rightfully earned his place as Spider-Man alongside Peter Parker. The only flaw of the film is that its too short. I want to see more of this Spider-Man or more multiverse Spider-Man animated in this style.<br/><br/>I never thought any other Spider-man film would top the OG Raimi Spider-man film. But Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse just did."

","Although I do enjoy them I have never really been a HUGE fan of superhero movies specially not Spider-Man. I only saw this as a teaser at the end of Venom and was really intrigued by the animation/graphics style.<br/><br/>Fast forward a few months, my Marvel-fanatic friend tells me Into the Spider-Verse is in theaters and that we should go watch it. I was still interested after watching the clip but I never cared to watch any of the trailers (boy am I glad!).<br/><br/>What I experienced was an amazing 2 hours of the most beautiful looking visuals and animations that blew me away. I am pretty sure I had a visual-orgasm for the first time. The story-telling is smooth and I cannot think of one thing that they got wrong. The tiny nuances of the characters and the attention to detail in this movie is something that sets the bar so high for others. Now, I have watched the other Marvel hits (Guardians of Galaxy-ies being my favorite) but this one is on a totally different level.<br/><br/>I am gonna go watch this again (which I have never done in my life) before it's out of the theaters and the only thing that worries me is if they'll live up to this in the sequel !"

"luningyuan-23687","9","7","45","8 December 2018"," Jump into the Spider-Verse with the new Spider-Man, Miles Morales
","Best Spider-Man movie ever!!! The best animation movie of the year!!! See 6 Spider-Men saving the world together, see how Miles Morales, the new Spider-Man, from a normal kid to a responsible and skilful hero.
The whole movie using a unique style, feeling the audiences are reading a comic book, feeling like those old comic book but because of the printer error, everything looks a little bit obscure. Feeling like that the director and producers bring the comic book s back to life and in 3D.
The speed of this movie is so good. A new kid got bite by the spider and from an idiot to a master is the base line of this story. And then we give him the family line. Father issue, best friend is his uncle who we all know will die. How to fix the family problem is another line. Then writers give him the third one, bad guy Fisk, other Spider-Man as his teachers, I would call this the motive line, why he want to become a real Spider-Man.
Although, 6 Spider-Man in this movie, Miles Morales is the absolute protagonist. Also could say it's such a pity that the movie did not using too much part to talk about other Spider-Man. But luckily it did not, otherwise this movie gonna lose its focus. See, 6 charming, unique, special Spider-Man but still cannot let other steal Miles's thunder. I'm surprise about the way they manage that!
Here comes to the flaw. The BGM really loud, even cover the line sometimes. Okay no other flaws, just buy your tickets and go to watch."

"bastille-852-731547","8","3","14","14 December 2018"," Entertaining, Visually-Stunning, Creative Spider-Man Movie
","Featuring a unique animation style and plenty of clever writing, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a Spider-Man movie like none other. The film centers on Miles Morales, a teenager from Brooklyn who finds that he can possess powers of Spider-Man in both this reality as well as another reality. Eventually, his paths collide with Peter Parker as well as several others, as they must stop a villain named Kingpin. The film's stylized animation style is intended to look and feel just like a comic book, and that it does. While some viewers might find it a bit jarring from time to time, the animation looks outstanding and has an extraordinary level of attention to detail. A scene near the climax with Miles Morales web-swinging through Manhattan is utterly stunning. The film has plenty of Easter eggs throughout as well, which superhero fans will most certainly appreciate, as well as a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>The story is engaging and entertaining, and the film is well-paced without ever dragging. The narrative opens up many dimensions (pun intended) to the plot, but is able to properly tie up all loose ends by the film's thrilling and engaging climax. Unlike some superhero movies, a real emotional connection between many of the principal characters is formed in that you actually feel for them. The characters are also quite well-developed, even if such development is formed in a somewhat repetitive manner at times. My only real criticism of the film is that the villains (besides Kingpin) were not always enthralling and did not always add as much to the narrative as they could have in the scenes in which they appeared. Otherwise, this highly entertaining and original take on Spider-Man is a breath of fresh air for those of us getting tired of some of the more derivative superhero movies. Gladly recommended. 8/10<br/><br/>Note: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema. My friend and I both agreed that the format really enhanced the experience, as the sound and picture quality were both very strong. The use of the ""rumble"" effect was effective and immersive, and was used more frequently than other films I have seen in Dolby."

"aidenjgray","10","7","48","9 December 2018"," Perfect for not only fans of the comics, but anyone.
","So I was lucky enough to buy tickets to an early screening of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, and let me just say that I thought it was absolutely amazing. A true love letter to the biggest Spider-Man fans. Though even if you don't know much about Spider-Man, you will enjoy this movie. All the references to the comics and TV shows and other movies made me happy. The film is hilarious, mature, and surprisingly dark at some times. It has a stellar voice cast that I will get into now. I will forever hear @shameikmoore as Miles Morales, and it was fantastic seeing him get his due in film. They captured his attitude and personality perfectly. I loved @mrjakejohnson as Peter Parker. Not only because I'm a fan of his, but he captures the deadbeat attitude of this version while still having the classic Parker charm. @haileesteinfeld does a really good job voicing Spider-Gwen and it actually caused me to like the character more than I previously had. As for the others, @ohlittleasianone and @johnmulaney are fun as Peni Parker and Spider-Ham, I really enjoyed Nicholas Cage as Spider-Man Noir, the always great @mahershalaali voices Miles' Uncle Aaron, and @lievschreiber voices a menacing Kingpin. And Stan Lee has a great cameo. The animation and action are stunning and beautiful. They recreate the ways of doing things we've seen in other Spider-Man movies in such creative ways. I'm serious the animation is probably the most stunning I've ever seen. From the beginning you can tell they had fun worth it. Even the credits are beautiful. The story and script are flawless, and the post credits scene is one of the most hilarious yet. Overall this is the best Spider-Man movie there has been (as much as I loved Homecoming). It's even dedicated in Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's honor. The soundtrack is fire as well. As a huge Spider-Man fan my whole life, I can't recommend it enough, and I can't wait to watch it again.... and again.... and again."

"evanston_dad","7","4","23","18 December 2018"," Refreshingly Multicultural
","A refreshingly multicultural spin on a genre that has traditionally been predominantly male and predominantly white. What I love about a film like ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is that a wide range of young kids can watch this film and see in it people who look and sound like them. It resembles the world as it actually exists rather than the worlds of most super hero movies, where white men are constantly saving the day. It also has a funky sound and look to it. The movie teems with urban flavor and the animation, purposely pixelated to recreate the look of an old-fashioned comic book, is gorgeous.<br/><br/>But this is still, disappointingly, a super hero movie, which, if popular sentiment is any indication, is pretty much a problem only for me. That's fine, I can live with that knowledge. The movie is just so formulaic, with a draggy central story line about a kid whose insecurity prevents him from rising to his full super hero potential until....guess what?....he does. There's one (or a few) too many scenes with other characters giving him lectures about how to become his true self, etc. etc. And the story is weak, a confusing mish-mosh of villains and mega-weapons and alternate universes. True to super hero movie conventions, the filmmakers try to disguise how messy the screenplay is by burying it under an avalanche of loud, hectic action scenes that throw a lot of stuff at us and hope something sticks.<br/><br/>So my dislike of super hero movies and everything that comes with them prevented me from fully enjoying this movie, but if I'm going to watch a super hero movie at all I want more that look and sound like this one.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","Trying to be realistic and not burying myself headfirst in the hype, this is the best Spider-Man since Tobey Maguire. Nice story, good pace, unique animations that have seemed to enchant everyone with good moments of humor thanks to the OG Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Being a huge fan of the 1994 Spider-Man series I just couldn't help but compare it to this new Spider-Man. Clearly this cartoon/animation is made for the new generation of kids with all the modern songs and style. Personally, I am not a fan of this dashing style of animation but I still enjoyed the action packed sequences. Spider-Gwen and Nic Cage Spider-Man were my two favorites and I would love to see something with these two.<br/><br/>The biggest knock is that throughout the first 1.5 hours, Miles is developing nice and steadily but then all of a sudden when the plot requires it, he just gets on a whole new level and acquires all the abilities in an instant which to be honest is not the way Spider-man works.<br/><br/>Definitely to be seen in the cinema as it will not feel and look the same way at home on the TV/Laptop."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","3","1 July 2019"," Fun watch pretty much, even it misses real emotion and significant depth
","""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is an American animated movie from 2018, so still relatively new and fresh and actually this was the dominating film at awards ceremonies last year from the genre. It won the BAFTA, Golden Globe and eventually Oscar as well, not to mention managing a rare clean sweep for all its nominated categories at the Annie Awards. I will spare you the names of the many writers and directors here, as you can check them out for yourself, but the voice cast sure was spectacular. Lead actor Moore is not too famous and Johnson (who voices Peter Parker) is probably also only known to New Girl fans, but Steinfeld, Ali, Tomlin, maybe Pine and of course Nicholas Cage (Kick-Ass anybody?) should really be known to non-film buffs too. Maybe a few others as well. I mean there wasn't a voice performance that really stood out, but they were all rock-solid. Maybe American viewers will recognize them better. In terms of their voices. Or won't because they did such a great job. Let me say initially that I watched the version that runs for under 2 hours slightly and not the one that gets closer to the 2.5-hour mark. Still a fairly long movie for the animation genre. But it never feels that long, it rolls really smoothly thanks to a good story at its core, constant comedic delight and distraction, memorable characters as well as great attention to detail. There are only minor criticisms I have here. One would be that the father-son story struggled for a long time to really become as significant as they wanted it to be, even if right from the beginning there are solid comedic moments like when he takes him to school and says something like ""I love you"" in front of everybody and towards the end, it is also nice as well. Another, maybe my biggest, was that really how he developed his strengths and talents felt way too sudden. There should be a slow path to his craft where we see him struggle and fail with using his webs, his invisibility, his electric shocks etc. but it was fairly rushed. Oh yeah, and I was a bit confused Gwen Stacy was also the alternate universe Spider Man really. Or the part about his dad hating Spider-Man.<br/><br/>So much for the negative, now for the positive: This film was looots of fun all in all. Many highly enjoyable sequences and those that did not do too much for me, like the big battle scene vs. Kingpin towards the end were at least visually on a truly high level. You can also see that the film does not take itself too seriously although it had the right to do so. Kingpin's looks are the best example. And then the 4(?) alternate universe Spider Mans. I mean the anime girl was so much fun and it was actually pretty sad when she lost her vehicle near the end and also to see how they were bonding with her and understood her pain. Film noir Spidey (Cage) was a lot of fun with his Rubik's Cube. Spider Woman was good too, even if the female character that impressed me more was Olivia Octavius, maybe also because of how surprising it was they went for a female version of her. In general, the film used many interesting references from the franchise, Green Goblin has a brief presence, Doc Ock is in it for longer. The losing one's uncle part is of course a memorable parallel and still I did not see it coming. I wonder who Spidey Pig lost. By the way, if you thought Spider Pig was already amazing in the Simpsons movie, then you will be amazed by this one here. Oh god he even is a cannibal as we see on one occasion, but he has really many fun moments. The film's wit and courage can be seen so many times. The best example is probably that Peter Parker dies early on in here and somewhat ironically, this is the moment when he really enters the movie (from another dimension) and is seen constantly on screen to be somewhat of a teacher, but more than that, actually more of a friend in fact to the one who is about to take PP's place in this new dimension. This crucial story point of Miles being bitten around the same time when Parker dies was one of the best things about the film. There again it is not a special moment or so, he just pushes the spider away as if it was nothing. Funnily enough this is when it all started when he was hanging around with his uncle, later on his enemy, but still beloved. The one thing missing here was perhaps Jonah Jameson or maybe he was also in it so brief that I missed him. I think not though.<br/><br/>I already mentioned the great attention to detail. This applies to the moments when the film moves forward story-wise, but also these small moments, be it a hommage to Stan Lee that most Avengers movies can only dream of quality-wise, the most funny pig comment with the actual pig standing right next to them or just really minor things like talk about ""great expectations"" literature-wise vs. no expectations. No idea why I remembered this so closely. I think usually these films stand and fall with the main antagonist, but this is really more about becoming a hero and defeating the bad guy on the way. Kingpin is okay, but he never truly steals the show. Also interesting his own background story why he wants to open the portal to another dimension not knowing that even if he can get his wife and son back this way, they are still doomed, so everything is lost in any case for him. Now looking at the animation, it was good overall in terms of characters, pretty spectacular in terms of special effects on many occasions and to me it did look a bit like a video game in the calmer more restrained moments. By the way, most random snippet of information, there is also an actress names Morales in here. You could also think that there is more of a focus on ethnicity with the protagonist being a mix of Black and Hispanic, but there really isn't and I certainly liked that. No need to shove any forced messages into our face here and make a cringeworthy try-hard impact to fit in with the current political climate. Instead, the film elaborates on friendship and togetherness more than anything else and another great idea behind it all is that this film does not take place in the dimension where Peter Parker is key. Or at least not after he dies. It does not take place in the dimension where we live in, even if it feels this way sometimes. Now overall, a really good film and almost a must-see for animation lovers. It is definitely better than the very overrated Incredibles sequel from last year that did a lot wrong that this film here did right. I still think it is maybe not as outstanding as you could think from all the awards recognition it received and also if you take a look at the rating here on imdb. Sure, during its best moments it is better than 3 stars out of 5, but all in all, that sounds pretty accurate to me as the really big emotions they sometimes tried to go for weren't really evoked when it comes to my subjective perception. Also not by any definition the best animated movie of all time, which it was here on imdb for a while. It is pretty revolutionary with the idea of different dimensions and the execution, but Top10 is the limit I'd say. And it's not my favorite Spider-Man movie either. That would still be Maguire's first vs. Dafoe. Perhaps it is approximately on par with the sequel there. All, in all a positive recommendation with no hesitation, just don't expect true greatness."
"gigitville","10","1","3","26 May 2019"," No Movie is Perfect, but This Comes Extraordinarily Close
","The only criticism I have for this movie is that I wish they spent a little more time strengthening the villain. Even then, King Pin was stronger than a lot of other supervillains out there. The reason I'm starting with the negative is because I love this movie so much and want to focus on the positives.<br/><br/>A few things I loved in particular were the balance of humor and emotional moments, the depth of the characters, the animation style?! Oh my God. It was visually my favorite animated movie of all time. It was a perfect blend of comic book art and cinematic storytelling instead of pure comic book style like The Walking Dead game, for example. But also, the voice acting was incredible, there was subtle aspects of story-telling that subconsciously strengthened the story. For example, Miles starting out by passing through his old school that's familiar to him, then getting into the new school that was a difficult but doable challenge, with his dad's support. Exactly how he went through his familiar life of school and spray painting to being Spider-Man, with the support of his dad. Well, his dad could represent his family as a whole because Miles felt like he was disappointing everyone but learned he needed to communicate and didn't have to do everything on his own. Character development, ugh I love it. And that's just one thing!<br/><br/>Peter B. Parker learning to be a little bit more vulnerable and taking a risk by mentoring Miles. And it made sense that Peter would let Miles help him, because he quickly realized he was stuck with Miles, and knew they'd both be better off if Miles knew what he was doing.<br/><br/>Things just made sense, which shouldn't be a landmark for good movies, but hey, it's the world we're living in.<br/><br/>But like, it makes sense that the spider people from the other universes would glitch while they were in the wrong universe, and that when shutting down the machine, someone would need to stay behind to shut it down. The story beats and emotional beats fit so well because the filmmakers knew what they were doing and took a thorough approach to their movie. God, I loved it."

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","10","1","3","1 April 2019"," A visually groundbreaking, laugh-out-loud funny, and overall entertaining superhero film.
","There's no hiding that Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. My reviews of Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Venom (2018) say as much. I grew up watching the 1990s animated Spider-Man show, so when I saw early trailers for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), I half-thought it would be some direct-to-video movie. After all, everything up until now had been live-action. I was encouraged to learn that it would receive a theatrical release, especially when I started to see more footage of its unique artistic style. Not only does Into the Spider-Verse embrace its comic book origins, but it also does so with a flair and panache that I'd almost like to see in other superhero franchises.<br/><br/>Over the years, I'd only loosely been paying attention to what was happening in the Spider-Man comics. Sure, I knew about Spider-Gwen (Hailee Steinfeld) and Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) but more in the sense that they were departures from the white-male Peter Parker (Jake Johnson) that carried the franchise for so long. It then makes sense that these three were what dominated the first half of this movie. While I adored Peni Parker (Kimiko Glenn) and Spider-Man Noir (Nicholas Cage)-not Spider-Ham (John Mulaney) as much-their extreme takes on the theme could have used a little more screen time, even if they might have distracted from the primary narrative.<br/><br/>In the end, choosing to make Into the Spider-Verse animated helped to open up the creative options available to it in this medium. I could see why it won the Best Animated Picture Oscar this year, as the fusion of classic 2-D comic books and 3-D CGI blended in an endlessly entertaining way. I'm excited that there seems to be a sequel in the works, as my appetite has been whetted with this film and I'm ready to consume more of it as soon as possible. I just hope it lives up to the nearly perfect presentation that this trailblazing movie managed to create.<br/><br/>A visually groundbreaking, laugh-out-loud funny, and overall entertaining superhero film, I give Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse 5.0 stars out of 5."
"mossow92","8","1","3","23 March 2019"," Great movie, even to a Spiderman purist.
","I've always been a purist. I enjoy the classic comics and their stories the most. Just how I was raised and what I grew up with. I know of the Morales storyline, just never gave it much credence. So, I was a little hesitant heading into this movie to say the least. That all aside, this little flick was a lot of fun. A fun, though not original, story leads all the various Spider characters together in a fun ride through Marvel lore. Was also very pleased with the adult overtones to the story while keeping it an animation movie for kids, which so many new cartoon movies do so well these days. In the end, while I may still believe that Peter Parker is the Spiderman, I now have a better understanding and appreciation of Morales and the other variations of Spiderman and their place in the Marvel Universe. Well done, Sony. And, of course, RIP Stan Lee. You will be missed."

"cruise01","10","1","3","21 March 2019"," Spectacular and crazy wild ride bringing a new take on Spider-Man.
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (5 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse proves that after a few times rebooting a Spider man origin story into a movie can never get old. You would think there is plenty of different Spider Man movies done so quickly within the last 15 years. Into the Spider Verse takes a different approach. Approaching the material and adapting the comic book into a movie. With colorful animation and visuals with the word effects or comic book action violence. The movie is spectacular and one of the best Spider Man movies ever.<br/><br/>From the help of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (the people who did the 21 Jump Street movies and Lego Movies) takes the comic book material and they bring a kinetic energy with the story. The plot follows Miles (Shameik Moore) a teenager who is forced into private school with his father being a police officer and a mother that is busy as a nurse. He gets bit by a radioactive spider. And he notices changes such as having sticky fingers and being toned out. When the Kingpin tries to turn on a particle accelerator which Peter Parker/Spider-Man fails to stop him. He asks Miles to learn to take the responsibility and stop Kingpin. Miles meets other Spider-Mans from other alternate universes such as a burnt out Peter Parker (who is out of shape, careless, and depressed looking), Spider-Ham (a talking pig), Peni Parker (a young girl with a spider robot), and Gwen Stacy (Spider girl).<br/><br/>The film does have a lot of throwback references that brings in some easter eggs from Sam Raimi Spider man movies. The film is a lot of fun. The most fun you will ever have watching a superhero movie on the big screen. Director Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman did a fantastic job in adapting the comic book into an animated film. The animation is slick, stylized, and colorful. If you are sensitive to flashy lights and fast paced changing colors it may be a difficult film to see. The characters are a lot of fun. Miles is that type of likable character were you can try to relate too. The villain Kingpin did look a bit cheesy with having a gigantic body that seems very inhuman. But it was a lot of fun. The story and direction runs at a kinetic fast pace energy. And the action sequences are stylized and exciting.<br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a great film. Definitely a recommended film if you are into comic books or superhero movies. This Spider Man is a lot of fun. It has a fast paced story, it has action, and the animation/ visuals are entertaining with a comic book brought to the big screen. The soundtrack in the film which brings in a hip hop tone works great with the movie."

","So, I watched this because my 2 roommates reeeally really wanted to see it, but from all I knew, it was just a kids movie. A family friendly animated spiderman, sort of like the Clone Wars.<br/><br/>However, I was very surprised. It is surprisingly (did I spell that right?) adult. People die. Several people die. There's a very sensual feel sometimes, and very deep stuff, but still keeping it at a teenager level sort of.<br/><br/>The music selection is amongst the best I've seen (heard?). It is very good, think GTA San Andreas but a bit more modern. Classy hiphop.<br/><br/>The animation is amazing. It's in a comic book style, but in movie format. I believe that 2-3 years ago, this would've been impossible to make. They spent an amazing amount of money on it, and they seem to have had an extraordinary team of animators.<br/><br/>There was a hint of a lovestory, but it never panned out. They didn't make it ridiculous or childish, they had it pretty good.<br/><br/>I'm way too tired to write more, but baseline is, they made it an incredible movie, and I would definitively recommend it."

When circumstances change dramatically Miles is forced to grow up as the responsibility of carrying on the superhero mantle falls on his shoulders, but not without some unexpected help. Striking animation, large-scale action scenes, brilliant vocal work, subversive and ingenious gags, and a hip, energetic soundtrack are the driving force of this highly enjoyable film, but it also features plenty of heart, heroism, and an important message about family and responsibility. An exciting and frequently funny little ride that's pleasing even if you're not a dedicated comic book fan. ***"

I said wild because there's a different vibe on it. As the movie is about Miles, it has to be diferent than peter's world and you really feel the atmosphere they're trying to put there by the musics the painting the draws and even the lifestyle of Miles and they use a lot of references from comics too, not only on the plot but on the editing too.

"mouniraitsaid-71311","8","1","3","15 January 2019"," Into the Verse
","Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse (8.5/10)<br/><br/>Director: Bob Persichetti/Peter Ramsey/Rodney Rothman<br/><br/>Runtime: 117 Minutes<br/><br/>Into The Spiderverse is one of the last big films of 2018, I still need to get round to seeing Mary Poppins Returns and then my reviews for 2018 will slowly be reaching their end. The latest Spiderman adventure stays away from the story of Peter Parker and gives us a new main character in the form of Miles Morales. We've had three different incarnations of Spiderman in the last decade, all three telling us the exact same origin story, though Homecoming did differ slightly. If anyone is interested in knowing my thoughts on the previous movies, Spiderman 1 and 26 are both amazing superhero flicks, 3 is average but incredibly flawed. The Amazing Spiderman is ok, however, it's nothing new and becomes boring to watch. The sequel is incredibly bad. Finally, I appreciate Homecoming for not needing to tell us Spiderman's origin story again but it still felt like a safe superhero movie, never taking any risks. In Spiderverse, instead of one origin story, we get five and all are done in humour fashions.<br/><br/>Miles Morales comes across the long-dead Peter Parker. This Peter Parker is not from his world though; he's from somewhere else in the multiverse. With Parker's guidance, Miles will become Spider-Man: and through that he will become part of the ever-expanding 'Spider-Verse'.<br/><br/>Though the story begins with Peter Parker, this is definitely not his story. Miles Morales is a nice change of pace, he's very relatable, smart like Peter Parker, but much more of a street punk. Wanting to spend his free time spray painting his art under subways, or listening to hip-hop tracks with his uncle. Every other Spiderman gets enough development to make them worthy of the title, Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey are the most fleshed out. With the movie only slightly delving into the origin stories of the other three incarnations. If it wasn't for Nicolas Cage voicing Spiderman Noir, then I probably wouldn't care about the character but Cage always knows how to have fun in a role.<br/><br/>I've got to talk about the biggest standout of the movie, the animation. It's absolutely stunning, the best animation seen all year. It truly is a comic book brought to life, the colours are always popping and vibrant, the mixture of 2D and 3D animation blends so smoothly. It's like nothing I've ever seen before and I look forward to seeing more from this universe in the future and because it's animated in such a way you're able to accomplish things you could never see in a live action Spiderman movie. It shifts tones really well, its extremely funny and has enough good visual gags but when it's time to get serious all three of its directors know this and the transition is always welcomed.<br/><br/>There were a few redesigns that I didn't like, especially the Green Goblins whos original design is one of my favourites from the Spiderman universe and I was really sad to not be able to see it animated in this world. Although I loved most of the gags, there were a few that didn't land for me and although the soundtrack was really good and I see it appealing to the younger audience, personally I don't like this music so it didn't really add much to the feel of the movie. However, this is a minor personal thing and I don't consider it much of an issue.<br/><br/>Overall, Into The Spiderverse is one of the best Spiderman movies ever. Is it the best? Well, that's up for debate. Its animation makes it stand out and feel fresh, it's frequently funny and has a lot of good visual gags. Every Spiderman gets their time to shine. The action is intense and beautiful."
"cyraswest","10","1","3","15 January 2019"," Best Spider-man movie, perhaps even best Superhero movie
","This movie just felt like our favorite wall-crawler more than any other adaptations, it captured the essence of Spider-man. With the help of the unique animation style and over-exaggerated character design, it created a Spider-verse that truly feels genuine, lived in. Voice acting and background music was very well handled, there are a couple scenes that actually got me to tear up (which I never do) The Easter-eggs are fun and a lot of things you will miss, if you know your comics, then you will be rewarded with a lot of references. The credit scene is magical and the end-credit scene is ten out of ten. Soundtrack is great, not to mention the writing, able to present so much obstacle and so many things changed because of these obstacles, connecting or reference back to scenes or things that specific character did earlier in the film."
"gavinp9","8","1","3","14 January 2019"," A fun, different, great comic-book film
","'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' doesn't really fit into the MCU, but it doesn't need to - it works as a stand-alone animated film, so long as you have some knowledge of the Spider-man world. That's what this film does well - stay true to Spider-Man's character, but have multiple versions fighting to save the world. It's PG, but there's not too much violence. There is, however, plenty of multi/parallel universe/reality issues, so be prepared to try to explain that to kids!<br/><br/>Basically, Miles (Moore) lives in a world where the Kingpin (Schreiber) kills Spider-Man while using a supercollider to try & bring his family back to life. The supercollider creates a rift in the space/time continuum, resulting in multiple Spider-people being taken from their universes - slightly-older Peter Parker (Johnson), Spider-Women/Gwen (Steinfeld), Spider-Ham (Mulaney), Spider-Man Noir (Cage) and a manga Peni Parker (Glenn). Miles has only just been bitten by a spider and is dealing with some family troubles with his Dad (Tyree Henry) and Uncle Aaron (Ali), when all this is trust upon him. It's up to him to help the original Spider-Man and all the alternate Spider-people to get them home and defeat Kingpin and Dr Octopus (Hahn).<br/><br/>The film does a great job of bringing in familiar faces - Aunt May (Tomlin), Mary Jane (Kravitz), Gwen, Kingpin, Dr Ock, Green Goblin, Scorpion - and a very fitting final cameo from Stan Lee. All the other Spider-people are distinct and have their moments. There's some excellent animation and a nice mixture of comic-book scenes and some nice emotional moments. Great ending & I'm glad there's a female Spider-Woman and black Spider-man for kids to look up to now. Also a nice tribute to Spider-Man creators Stan Lee & Steve Ditko at the end - timely since they both passed in 2018. This film would've made them both proud."

","Into The Spider-Verse is unrelentingly creative and daring, pulling off in spectacular fashion a story so strange and unique it would have been deemed box-office suicide ten years ago.<br/><br/>Every scene looks like it's been ripped straight out of a comic book, with a dotted halftone texture decorating every object and speech/thought bubbles appearing in the background. Each frame of the movie has been carefully crafted to be as creative and engaging as possible, and the film even occasionally acknowledges the virtual camera.<br/><br/>On a similar note, Into The Spider-Verse is filled with self-referential and meta humor, which fits in very appropriately. Three of the main six 'spidermen' are purely comic relief characters, but they're all effective in their own ways and are mostly parodies of different genres and clichés, with Spider-Noir being my personal favorite (and Spider-Ham close behind).<br/><br/>The animation itself was the most meticulously crafted and unique I've seen since The Lego Movie. The animators played around with focus, colour, framerate, time lapses, split screen, onomatopoeic text and much more. Even if the plot and characters had been awful, this film would have been worth seeing for the visuals alone. The ending in particular is very reminiscent of Doctor Strange, and even takes some queues from 2001 in terms of its cinematography.<br/><br/>Every major character had just enough depth and motive to make them interesting, and their backstory would always be revealed in an engaging way. This would sometimes make up for it being somewhat formulaic - Kingpin is a prime example here. Initially, the trailers had me slightly worried about the script and voice-acting, but most of the more clichéd material seemed to be purely for the trailers.<br/><br/>The rap-themed soundtrack was largely appropriate and added a lot to certain scenes. Also, the after credits scene is probably my favorite ever. It has to be seen to be believed - definitely stick around for it.<br/><br/>This might be my favorite Spider-Man film ever, and certainly the success that Sony has been waiting for. It's a visual feast, and a pretty solid screenplay as well. I'd recommend it to everyone."

","Animated adventure in the style of a comic in association with Marvel.<br/><br/>This wasn't on my watch-list, but my wife had another appointment so I decided to go on my own, and I'm glad I did.

","I'm embarrassed to say I like superheroes. It's not ok. I'm a 33 year-old man living with his parents. I just need to join some brony incel forums to complete the cliché. I know #notallnerds are pepe-loving 4chaners, but it doesn't feel that way. Quality be damned, it's not ok to like Star Wars, Rick and Morty, video games, superhero comics, anime, etc. I'm not moaning. I really feel like it's not ok to like these things in the Trump fandom era.<br/><br/>Fandoms seem, in general, for angry, pedantic, sexless ghouls, for nihilistic, alt-right trolls, for ""sjw"" bashing gamergaters too far gone down the fantasy hole. I don't want to be associated with these angry white man-boys (even if I am white and sometimes angry and technically a man). I want to be one of the Good Guys, struggling, stretching, limping towards the Good, Stan Lee's True Believer. I want to be Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Or I did at a younger point in life. I think about Spider-Man nowadays the way one thinks about an old childhood friend. Time has passed. I've grown into a person that can't lean on superheroes the way I used to. But gone is not the love; it need only be remembered.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse, a bold, flamboyant, joyful, energetic movie helped me remember my old spidey love, my love for superheroes in general. Watching it is a shock to the senses, to my programmed expectations of its lurching live-action cousins. Spider-Verse is fun. The comedy is loose and nimble instead of canned and obligatory. The dialogue is present, expressive, distinctly American, instead of glib, monotone, or manufactured for an overseas translation. The story treatment walks the difficult line of levity and intelligence, never taking itself too seriously, but not afraid to evoke pathos partial to the Spider-Man story.<br/><br/>Spider-Verse practically invents a new animation style using comic book visual keys in a way that finally makes sense. From Dick Tracy to Scott Pilgrim Vs The World, live actions movies have attempted this gimmick with varying (often dubious) success. Spider-Verse, being a cartoon, doesn't have to figure out the tricky visual contract between the real and hyper-real. The comic book aesthetic is baked in from the start with a dotted texture ala Lichtenstein. In a clever sequence, the screen abounds with text boxes and splashy onomatopoeias after Miles Morales gets his spidey powers. But the comic gimmick is just a starting point before sampling street art, anime, Looney Tunes, and psychedelic styles with spectacular wit.<br/><br/>The story is a trippy, multiverse-spanning hopscotch of Spider-Persons converging on the universe of one Miles Morales, a teenage African/Latino American from Brooklyn, and the next Spider-Man. But first, Miles must prove himself under the mentorship of an alternate Peter B. Parker, a thirty-something dad bod who's been around the spider-block a few times. Miles and Peter B. soon team up with Spider-Men and Women from stranger shores of the multiverse, including the original refrigerated girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, and a Looney Tunes-esque pig, Spider-Ham. In case none of this makes sense, the movie gently glides through the basic Spider-Man lore before exploding it.<br/><br/>Encyclopedic Spider-Man nerds will be rewarded but not strictly pandered to. The Spider-Verse is for everyone, a message (and tacit slogan) of the movie. Anyone can wear the mask. Anyone can play the hero in their own story. Having seen Spider-Verse twice now in theaters, it's a touching scene sitting with such a diverse audience, young and old, all different colors, all rooting for Spider-Man, but not a fandom bound by a hierarchy of obsessive, pedantic trolls. Just people sitting together, cheering on their inner hero, feeling the joy of their multiversed possibilities, and the hope that one of them makes sense in reality. To quote Mary Jane Watson, ""Go get 'em, tiger."""

","Slightly disappointed they missed to include the Bulgarian social media sensation that is Spinderman. But overall fantastic movie."
"TheVictoriousV","7","1","3","4 January 2019"," It always fits, eventually. (Copied from myself with permission)
","Like the Lego Batman Movie, this is a film that gets better and smarter the more knowledge you have about the titular hero and their pop culture history. Another thing they have in common is an eye for visuals, although Into the Spider-Verse supplies an art style that's unlike anything I have seen.<br/><br/>Looking more like ""a comic come to life"" than anything Sam Raimi could have hoped for (it even has those dots that appear when you print graphic novels, and is presented in a low frame-rate so as to emulate 2D animation), this hilarious film is a trip down memory lane for Spider-Man and the many variations we've seen of him through the ages - be they different youngsters behind the mask, different adaptations, or in-canon duplicates from an Alternate Universe. In this one, the primary Spider-Man is Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), basically the second most popular Spidey of the comics after Peter Parker (played here by Jake Johnson).<br/><br/>The Parker of Miles' universe, voiced by Chris Pine, dies early on in the story, inciting Miles to take on the web-slinging and crime-fighting himself, but not before he predictably gets bitten by an experimented-on arachnid and develops powers accordingly. Alternate Parker, who arrives from another dimension in the experiment that kills Regular Parker, serves as young Miles' mentor. According to an appropriate sight gag, Parker is from a universe where Clone High WASN'T renewed. Is this ""our"" Peter?<br/><br/>If you've seen the previews, you know that other versions of the hero emerge. Hailee Steinfeld plays Spider-Woman, Nicolas Cage voices one Noir Spider-Man (yes, I just said all of that), Kimiko Glenn plays the Spidey equivalent from an ""anime"" universe, and then there's John Mulaney as the cartoony Peter Porker/Spider-Ham. Take a guess.<br/><br/>Other known faces from the cartoons and comics appear. Wilson ""Kingpin"" Fisk (Liev Schreiber) pulls the strings of the New York underworld, Mary-Jane Watson (Zoë Kravitz) shows up in two iterations, Aunt May (Lily Tomlin) has more in common with Madame Web than the May we know, and Miles' policeman father (Brian Tyree Henry) is initially not a big fan of the Spider, unlike his low-life uncle Aaron (Mahershala Ali). We can also spot Green Goblin, Tombstone, and Dr. Octopus, or at least versions of them.<br/><br/>Finally, it has the mandatory Stan Lee cameo - the most beautiful and profound one he could have been given, rest his soul. In addition to the Steve Ditko memorial and the ""Kirby dots"", this is indeed quite the love letter.<br/><br/>Seeing the film in 3D was, for once, an enhancement. While the film is more creative than mainstream comic-book movies normally allow themselves to be (it's only partially true that superhero fans don't require or deserve this level of effort), I admit the style is often of more weight than the substance - the plot tries to be ""out there"" but I feel like I've seen all this on Dexter's Lab. And Sony being Sony, they can't help but pander from time to time. Aren't the dramatic moments so much more hard-hitting and edgy when there's a XXXTENTACION track? (It is fascinating that the soundtrack was reportedly made into a vinyl disc that was ""Live DJ'd"" when they scored the film proper, but still.)<br/><br/>The action can also get too aggressive and fast-paced for its own good (Spider-Verse did not do wonders for my brother's headache). However, nothing feels out-of-place, even when the film incorporates elements from anime and noir as mentioned above. Not once is this amalgam of styles jarring, but there is a risk that the story loses you when you get used to the look.<br/><br/>You can nevertheless tell that Phil Lord and Chris Miller were in on this, as it is up there in terms of cleverness with, perhaps not The Lego Movie, but the aforementioned Batman spin-off. It may be Spider-Man's best movie, though you don't need to take my word for it, as I can't think of a prior Spidey film that I outright love. Still, I can praise Spider-Verse without feeling like too much of an outcast, since mainstream fans seemingly enjoy its humor, long-time geeks love its references to Spidey history (the more obscure the better) and critics admire its artistry."

This movie is currently ranked #3 of my top favorite movies ever falling beneath the shawshank redemption and the dark knight , imo it really is that good , I have only two complaints which are almost irrelevant and I will not mention and if you knew me personally you would know i think most movies are mediocre or worth a one time watch.

The last 10 minutes was also a letdown for me and the film could have wrapped up in a more succinct and original way. Still, definitely see this in theaters to get the full and nearly-flawless visual experience. Even the ""dull"" moments are a joy to watch.

The film's visuals are stunning and the soundtrack was on point., resulting in a great combination.<br/><br/>As a NYC girl I loved the Brooklyn vibe throughout the film. The borough was represented well. Miles Morales is a groundbreaking character that is very relatable. The Morales Family is a refreshing familial relationship in an animated film or any genre for that matter. Miles' Uncle Aaron is one of the coolest uncles to hit the screen. The Parker dynamic is surprisingly as well; Aunt May will bring an unexpected smile to your face.<br/><br/>The film introduces the comic books multiverse Spidermen, Spiderwomen, and alternate characters:
Spider-Man Noir, Spide-Gwen, Peni Parker, Spider-Ham (yes he is a pig). Nick Cage's Spiderman Noir is my sentimental favorite but I enjoyed all the characters. The chemistry was incredible.

Into the the spiderverse has everything the mcu lacks (good acting, directing, tension, humor that is actually funny, drama that actually matters, an interesting visual style, and characters that do things other than making obnoxious quips every five seconds). It isn't perfect, some parts are predictable and while they try to give the villains some depth they still aren't that interesting.

","I do not have the habit of apologizing for my guilty pleasures, and I will not do it this time either. From time to time I love to watch animation movies. I do it not only for the nostalgia of Walt Disney's masterpiece or to remember the pleasure of sharing the experience with my kids some time ago (it's the turn of my grand-kids now), but also because I believe that the animation films, like any other genre, have their own successes as well as failures. When it succeeds, good animation is an aesthetic pleasure, a source of emotions and thrills, a joy that we remember in time as we remember any other good films. But this is not the case with 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' - the latest success from the House of Marvel. And I will not argue with the success either.<br/><br/>The more ambitious films of the comic-inspired genre are trying to bring new ideas to attract viewers, as even the most passionate fans of the genre need something new from time to time. In 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse', not even this new idea is exactly original - I've already seen in quite a few other movies the heroes of different comic series as they were brought to the screen and combined as heroes into the same story. In this case, the heroes of the various variants drawn or derived from Spider-Man, including Spider-Man Noir and Spider Girl, are gathered in one place (Manhattan, where else). Parallel universes of different stories with spider-men meet for the pleasure of the connoisseurs. Those less familiar with the sub-genre characters will not get that much from this reunion, and the resulting action did not seem terribly interesting to me either.<br/><br/>The result is, in my opinion, that we are dealing with yet another routine movie (animation movie this time), similar to just another magazine in a comics collection. For the enthusiasts it is important not to miss any issue. As an occasional spectator, nothing in the 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' seemed to me to be special, neither the animation nor the 3-D effects, neither the action nor the humor or the characters (the good or the bad). I'm sure this film will take its place in the collection and I am also sure that I'll forget it quickly. Its makers have been able to create something sparkling but already dusty before time."

","This review might include spoilers which i beleive would spoil the fun you will have by watching it.<br/><br/>I love cartoons and animations. It was a risky move in my opinion to widely broadcast an animated feature which is not the strong suit of Marvel side. Furthermore, the main character is the new Spider-man, Miles Morales. An average movie-goer would have no idea who he is and why Peter Parker is not Spider-man and why am I watching an alternative timeline referencing to the Spider-man movies that i watched. It all seemed irrelevant because the movie was very entertaining. Besides, I think Marvel cheated in a way by doing this, feeding from the vast legacy of the comics instead of biulding a movieverse like their other counterparts do.
Scenes out of comics, awesome; some meta interactions with the narrative aspect of the film, also awesome; Humor, götümü yararcasina funny; Story, it has ups and downs both in quality and pacing. I would have liked to see more basic heroic stuff done by Morales and his time in his new school. It was nice to see some parts in the movies originated from the comics straight out like his first costume(Halloween) and death of the original spider man by the hand of almost green goblin(asist ona yazilabilir). Glad to see spider-ham and felt he was a bit underused(but he has his moments). Some moments felt a bit forced(call back before old Peter parker goes back to his dimension or Old Peter parker and spider gwen's appreciation of Miles' agility at the climax of the film)<br/><br/>Overall, the movie might be better in some aspects than any other Spider-man film roaming around the world but personally, I enjoyed Homecoming more.

","The Spider-Man origin story about a teen who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and suddenly develops powers has been played out in numerous iterations before. Yet, this animated film is anything but typical - Miles Morales belongs to another reality, and as he's grappling with his new powers, he discovers there are multiple universes, each with their own Spider-Men, Spider-Woman, and... a Spider-Pig! It's impressive that a comic-book story this elaborate and outrageous managed to be green-lit, to begin with.<br/><br/>Directors Peter Ramsey, Bob Persichetti and Rodney Rothman make the most of it; they ensure that each Spider-entity is given ample screen-time, while the unique personalities of each superhero shine through brilliant performances by their respective voices. There's no weak link in the entire cast; all characters are played brilliantly. Miles Morales is infused with a lot of heart by Shameik Moore, while Jake Johnson does a delightfully laid-back take on Peter B. Parker. Hailee Steinfeld brings spunk to Gwen Stacy while Nicolas Cage is especially hilarious as Spider-Man Noir, and Liev Schreiber perfectly captures the Kingpin's looming presence as Wilson Fisk. The film also uses various styles of animation by taking the whole comic book premise to great heights, especially during the jaw-dropping climax that's a spectacle to behold, particularly in 3D.<br/><br/>'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a bold attempt to tell one of the most 'out there' stories in the comic book world. It's amazing to see all the components come together and work as well as they do. The tonality is funny, and heart-warming, while the visuals are exquisitely trippy at the same time. Those wondering if superhero fatigue is upon us would do themselves a favour to experience this in their nearest 3D screens and see how fresh the genre can continue to be through inventive and sometimes downright risky story-telling. Meanwhile, comic fans might as well book second viewings of what's arguably one of the best Spider-Man films to grace the big screen."

"ranblackman","10","1","4","8 July 2019"," It's a leap of faith.
","First, take: I loved this movie. On a simple front its a Great, wholesome, genuine take on the iconic comic character that has a lot of heart and laughs. More in-depth though it's a deeply good story of taking a leap in life. Pushing beyond boundaries and becoming something big, something you can do no matter what or who you are. It has a. Real charm to the animation, a visual comic. Colorful as hell, creatively over the too, yet also smooth in its action and sharp in its wit. There is a lot to get into here, so let's do it.<br/><br/>The acting:
All across the board solid. Every character has their own personality. From loners and outcasts to caring and composite father figures, to brave friends. Everyone has their time to make the viewers laugh and even cry, all the wide array of voice talent makes this all the truer. Even Nicholas Cage is genuine in this, playing this dark, brooding, noir version of Peter Parker, in a way a critique of overly edgy stories usually found in this subgenre.<br/><br/>The writing:
Sharp as a tack. It has a fair dose of heart and humor. The heart is portrayed from family love to friendship, to bravery. The humor is portrayed from light-hearted, to even meta and satire. All comes in just when it needs to and never stays too long. The dialogue also always helps it.<br/><br/>The Directing:
Same with the writing, on point. A good deal of prediction came into this, getting all of the angles and cutting right, making everything always feel quick yet smooth, well paced and never slow. It appears like a visual comic, literally, with the word bubbles and the bursts of bright light and flashing color. It all works together with each little interval. Some of the shots are stunning, most of them leap off.<br/><br/>The Animation:<br/><br/>It's everywhere. The characters are drawn with the top-notch expression and flowing movements. Calm and then hyper. Keeping the focus on what the charters are doing, and this is never hard to make out. Also, again, the color, everywhere in this one.<br/><br/>The story:
It's been told before sure, but like any old story, there is always potential to do something with it and this movie does. Combines with all the shared universe elements, breaking out of boundaries seems far more at home with itself. This world seems the right place to do it, as anywhere is. It seems its own place of imagination. Almost private, and when we see that change happens in the end, we that point of becoming this fantasy happens, we get behind it, young and old. All the needed emotional moments are their and effective as always. Even if the story has been told, it is still working.<br/><br/>Final take:
This movie was basically perfect. Everything worked here. It was precisely put together, stunning to look at, fun to watch, likable in its story and its education all across the board. A fun film for all really."

","Peter Parker has been happily the one and only Spider-Man saving the city over and over again for the last ten years. Miles Morales hates his new school although he is taken with fellow new student Gwen Stacy. His policeman father tries to keep him away from troubled Uncle Aaron. He stumbles upon a battle between Spider-Man and Wilson Fisk with his henchmen, Green Goblin and Prowler. A portal is opened between the Spider-Verse.<br/><br/>I really like Miles Morales. He's great with Gwen Stacy. The hair bit is hilarious. I'm over the moon for the first act. My first instinct is to have Jake Johnson play both Peter Parker. He's better acting as a slacker but if he could play the first Peter Parker, it would more compelling to see the change. The other issue is Gwen Stacy. She shows up before the incident. The movie explains it away as time travel but it would be better if it simply switched a couple of scenes. Overall, this is fun, imaginative, and glorious animation. It is also a great introduction to different Spider characters and holds potential for the live action movie world."

The animation, especially human movement is so believable that sometimes one cannot believe the performances are not by human actors. This is a great testimony to how far we have come.<br/><br/>As for the film itself, the plot is excellent and sometimes very touching. However, there is one thing missing: the middle part, arguably the best part of the movie, feels rushed. I would rate this film with a 9 or maybe even a 10, if the relations between the different Spider-men were explored in more detail.<br/><br/>It's a shame because everything else is excellent.<br/><br/>However, I expect AND DEMAND an extended version. I hope they decided that 1 hour and 50 minutes was already too long and decided to cut out the ""boring parts"".

"anselmdaniel","8","1","4","20 January 2019"," A wild and well animated tale
","This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse is directed by Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman. The animated movie premiered in 2008 and is written by Phil Lord. The movie stars Shameik Moore and Jake Johnson as the main voice cast. The movie is about a multiverse incident that Miles Morales becomes drawn into. He attempts to resolve the problem with the multiverse caused by Kingpin.<br/><br/>Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse is a solid movie. Across the board, the movie has a solid plot, solid visuals, and solid voice performances. There are many events in this movie that could be executed poorly, but the movie's direction and voice performances elevate it. The movie boasts many solid visuals from its incredibly distinctive design.<br/><br/>The visuals of this movie are easily the most distinctive and strongest part of the movie. The movie's visuals are not completely smooth at first, but with time the audience gets used to it. The visuals then flourish as the 117 minutes of running time go on. The visual only got better and more colorful as time went on. The ending sequence in the supercollider is exceptional as I do not think the scene could have worked as well live-action. The ending scene is both a treat to watch visually and experience emotionally.<br/><br/>The story is unique for a spider-man movie. The movie utilizes the multiverse and brings in multiple spider-man and spider-woman into the story. The new characters are introduced in a comic book style that fits the overall visual style of the film. These introductions are also funny as each of the spider-men come s from different backgrounds. This is something
that the movie does well as all of the different spider-men felt different. The movie utilized its humor incredibly well as many of the situations that Miles found himself in had humor to lighten the mood.<br/><br/>Miles Morales is a great spider-man. His entire story does not deviate from other spider-man stories much, but it is delivered in a way that feels fresh. This story is familiar, but the characters in the story are different from how we know them. It is this trait that makes the movie unique from other cinematic spider-man movies.<br/><br/>I would recommend Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse. This is a solid animated Spider-man movie for all ages to enjoy.<br/><br/>Grade: B"
"thesar-2","8","1","4","20 January 2019"," Miles from the Others
","Just a quickie on Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse: once you can get past the enormously long introduction/backstory of the new Spider-Man, the movie kicks into HIGH gear and is super fun, inventive and hilarious. Also, it contained many effectively emotional scenes, gorgeous shots and creativity with the world this animated film designed.<br/><br/>That all said, this movie felt like two complete movies jammed into one and a full 25-30 minutes could've been easily edited down. Seriously, that first half-hour was TOUGH to get through. Luckily, the reward is the rest of the film with many surprises to me and laugh-out-loud moments. Just stick with the movie and forgive the crew for not trimming this comfortably down for an easier watch.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."

"Vartiainen","Null","1","4","12 January 2019"," A movie that actually feels like a comic book
","Spider-Man: Into the Spide-Verse - despite the over-convoluted name - is the Spidey movie a lot of us have been waiting for. It's the comic book movie a lot of us have been waiting for.<br/><br/>And yes, there has been too many Spider-Man reboots over the last couple of decades. Fatigue has probably set in for a lot of people. Why should they care? What does this have the others didn't? Well, first of all, it's not really a reboot. It's actually better if you have a working knowledge of the previous Spider-Man films, especially the Raimi ones. It's kind of like how you can now make a Batman film without going over the origin story in any way. This movie works through that kind of logic, while still keeping it fresh by introducing Miles Morales, a new kind of Spider-Man.<br/><br/>And it's a lot of fun. There are a ton of characters, fast-paced action and a really nice, self-contained story without any sequel baits or anything like that. Sure, it can be a bit convoluted, but the quick humour, the witty banter and the familiar characters keep it chugging along like a well-oiled steam train.<br/><br/>But that's not the main reason why you should see this film. It's nice to have them and they elevate the film above merely good and well into the great category, but the reason you should absolutely check this movie out are the visuals. This is a stunningly gorgeous movie. All the colours, all the character designs, the textures, the graphics, the fluidity of the motion, the camera angles, the psychedelic set designs. This is manna from the heavens for any fan of animation. And it's most probably the movie that comes the closest to capturing the feeling of physical comic books, without in any way feeling like it's just a gimmick.<br/><br/>Trust me, see this movie. Even if you're tired with Spider-Man. Or with superheroes. Or with animation. It will reignite those feelings of adoration and love you once used to have. Promise."

"domtaylor","8","1","4","28 December 2018"," The best animated film of the year.
","'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' is a surprisingly mature, yet constantly entertaining animation that never loses its sense of fun despite the serious themes that it explores. At its core, the film is an origin story that hits all the beats that we have come to expect from films of its kind, however these elements are fused with the completely new 'multiverse' aspects and this ensures that the generic elements of the narrative don't prove to be much of a problem. The excellent character development also helps to keep the film fresh. While a few of the 'Spider-People' aren't really fleshed out further than their basic character traits, the majority of core characters have believable arcs that allow us to care for them. Peter B. Parker was a surprisingly nuanced character and his Spider-Man story is probably the most realistic one that we have ever seen on the big screen. Although it initially seemed distracting and some of the shots looked like you were watching the 3D version without the glasses, the animation style was overall excellent and really brought the comic book aesthetic to life, in a way that has never been seen before. The character design was also generally good, except from Kingpin's as he looked way too big and didn't really fit with the aesthetic style of the rest of the characters. Unlike a lot of recent superhero flicks, the film knows when to use humour and when to be serious, never confusing the two, allowing for both laugh-out loud comedic moments and genuinely tense and exciting action sequences. Overall, 'Into the Spider-Verse' is a fantastic film that knows exactly what it wants to be, and will appeal to children and adults alike thanks to its humour, action, and fleshed-out narrative. 8/10"

"statuskuo","7","1","4","26 December 2018"," Thank Donald Glover
","Ever since Glover begged to be a ""Black Spider-Man"", people were intrigued by the idea. Except purist nerds. So, here's your version where you can have two Peter Parkers in their 30's (?) and have the Black one too. Because they open up a universe that allows anyone to be Spider-man, if you can be bit by a radioactive spider, you can be a web spinning one. Okay, that's not the point to this movie though. It's basically to forgo the logic of...common sense. As in, how many radioactive spiders exists in New York City (the one this Spider-Boy exists in) Answer: Too many to deal with.
Look, it's a massive leap into a franchise that is overdone and boring. In fact, they joke about it. But the flash and dash and clever animation is brilliant and deserves the accolades, it still seems a little forced. Consider the logic again. Trying to tie some alternate universe into a changing storyline is things J.J. Abrams got a ton of flack for, somehow...fans forget his ""Star Trek"" went over this territory already.
Okay, nuts and bolts aside, it's fun. And funny. And good enough where you don't have to think too hard about these things. Kingpin, the villain, isn't just comically villainy. There is a point to his madness. And there are enough fun moments with Doc Oc or Liv that make it enjoyable.
Great way to launch a new style of animation others will start to rip off."
"roblesar99","8","4","38","10 December 2018"," The Best Spider-Man Film Since SPIDER-MAN 2
","The best Spider-Man film since SPIDER-MAN 2. An animated spectacle that not only invigorates, but transcends the superhero genre, resulting in not just the best superhero film of the year, but one of the best films of the year. This films understands the idea of Spider-Man better than any other Spider-Man film before it, recognizing the factors that have allowed this character to have become one of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's most beloved creations. At the end of the day, whether you're talking about Miles Morales or Peter Parker, Spider-Man's ""just a kid,"" as a bystander once said during SPIDER-MAN 2's most emotionally resonant scene. He might be ""just a kid"", but he's a kid endowed with superhuman powers who endeavors to use them for good, who represents not only the best of what humanity should be, but what the best of humanity can be. The original SPIDER-MAN is the first film that I can remember seeing in a movie theater, and although there are a quite a few films that I would deem superior to any take on the famed webslinger, the character will nonetheless always hold a special place in my heart.<br/><br/>While I'm not very familiar with the story of Miles Morales, Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, and Rodney Rothman's film does an excellent job introducing the audience to a character every bit as compelling as Peter Parker, with Shameik Moore bringing Morales to life with oodles of heart and charm. However, what most surprised me about the film was Jake Johnson's take on Peter Parker. Tom Holland might have finally captured the essence of the character better than both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield before him, but Johnson delivers my favorite take on the character thus far as a 40-year-old Parker stuck in a midlife crisis. Superheroes have a tendency to either not age or age very slowly, but Johnson's Parker is a man who has spent over half his life being a superhero, as who has thus seen the unavoidable toll such a life takes on the people around you. These ideas provide Parker with a fascinating character arc, but they thankfully don't overshadow that of Morales, as we watch him grow into New York's friendly neighborhood Spider-Man right before our very eyes.<br/><br/>This might be yet another origin story in a genre that has seen more than its fair share of them, but SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE feels different and fresh, which is a testament to Phil Lord and Rodney Rothman's script, which infuses Morales' journey with plenty of heart and wit. There are some poignant scenes in the film on par with anything in Raimi's original trilogy, from a death scene in the first act that sets the stage for Morales' story to a scene between Morales and his father (voiced to perfection by Brian Tyree Henry) at the end of the second act. Additionally the other ""Spider-Men,"" including Nicolas Cage's 1930s Spider-Noir and John Mulaney's Spider-Ham, are an absolute riot. I definitely wouldn't have minded spending some more time with those characters. Watching INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE was a cinematic experience like few others, thanks in part to the absolutely dazzling and dynamic 3D animation, which descends into a mesmerizing explosion of color during the final act and is unlike anything I have ever seen. That the film contains one of Stan Lee's best cameos to date is simply the cherry on top.<br/><br/>And the post-credits scene is seriously an all-timer. Might be the best one of these since *checks notes* FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF."

","This isnt the Spiderman I grew up watching. But as I see the current trend in Hollywood is to take the leading white male characters from successful movies of the past like Ghostbusters, James bond, Men in Black, Oceans series and turn them into either women, black or gray in the new movie. Into the spiderverse followed the same politically correct and turned Spiderman into every possible race, gender and animal on the planet. The question is is it really necessary? If you want to empower certain section of the society make new, good movies about them, but you can't. So you take the successful characters and turn them into black or female, even though it bombed so many times at the box office already. I hated the little kid spideman. Spiderman to me is a man, not a pig, not a girl and not a little black kid. Worst Spiderman movie ever.<br/><br/>Let Spiderman be Spiderman.

","A lot of things about this movie are AMAZING. The story, the characters, the visuals, the pace, the feeling, the comedy. It truly feels like a Spider-Man movie. Sure, there are some cliches here and there but aren't we all secretly love cliches? You don't want to see an edgy over the top Spider-Man, trust me.<br/><br/>And the other things are subjective depending on everyone's taste but they are not bad. For example, I didn't like the Spider Pig or whatever his name is but even that one, I will admit, it fits very well in this universe. So just because I didn't like something doesn't mean it's bad.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie hooks you in, it's unique and really charming. All the Spider ""People"" have interesting personalities and the action is really comic book style. I would have thought I'll have some problem with it because I'm not into this sort of thing but it managed to hook me in. The pace is fast and it allows for character development.<br/><br/>The second part, after the Spider Gang is assembled drops a little bit in quality maybe because the story becomes a little bit predictable. But come on, it's a Spider-Man movie. You know the drill, that's why you're watching it. Save the day in style, am I right?<br/><br/>Extra points for humor which is not awkward. A lot of times in superhero movies, the humor is quite awkward.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect movie but it has soul and charm and real Spider-Man vibes."
"fredlondi","7","1","15","3 January 2019"," Visually stunning film about an unwilling protagonist
","It's very hard to break new ground in the superhero genre. Not only have Marvel and DC fallen into their own unique set of clichÃ©s, but movies like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""Deadpool,"" each intended to subvert tropes, became old hat by their sequels.<br/><br/>Visually, ""Into The Spider-Verse"" is indeed a departure from several of these formulas. The animation is unique and fascinating, a colorful blend of digital and comic-book-style animation that was fun to watch (though at times made me wonder if I was watching a 3-D film without the glasses). There's a genuine effort to breathe new life into the genre and have fun with the source material, including its flaws, which was a welcome change from the garden-variety superhero film.<br/><br/>As much as I was impressed by the visuals, I couldn't help but feel a strange disconnect throughout the entire film, like trying to see something through the fog. It broke my immersion just enough to pull me from the story.<br/><br/>A nagging gripe I had about the film is the way the characters were handled. This felt like the cinematic equivalent of the ""Overwatch"" video game where diversity and character designs are substituted for creating interesting characters. Like Widowmaker and Tracer, these are characters designed to be drawn by a multitude of artists on Twitter - particularly in the NSFW realm, despite many of them being high school age and the Anime-inspired Penny Parker clearly even younger. This is further ironic because Penny has so little screen time and is given an emotional scene during the climax that is completely unearned.<br/><br/>Even Miles, who we spend the most time with in the film, doesn't have a clear motivation to become a superhero. Prior to being bitten, he doesn't have any motivations at all. He's not by nature altruistic and treats his newfound powers as an irritation, something forcing him to conform, just like the prep school his parents put him into. Both as a student and, later, a superhero-in-training, older figures are frustrated that they can't seem to get Miles to focus on improving himself. He's inhibiting himself, and at least one teacher calls him out on it.<br/><br/>About all Miles wants to do in this film is vandalize New York with stickers and spray paint, something he does from the very first moment we see him right up to the end credits. The closest thing he does to channeling this interest is spray-painting one of Spider-Man's suits to make his own. Any arc of him turning his talents toward art, like a similar character in ""Equalizer 2,"" is instead big-footed by a typical Marvel plot to which he is completely unsuited. While there are times that he seems to be picking up skills from his cohorts, none of these lessons have any permanence in his mind. He gives up near the film's climax with frustrating ease, and the group all but gives up on him.<br/><br/>In this way, Miles reminded me of Nick Cannon's character in ""Drumline"" - someone with clear talents, but no desire to refine them, instead wanting to have respect handed to him without putting in the work. In both films, we do not see a protagonist change, but instead, others around him changing in order to accommodate him. The only difference in ""Spider-Verse"" is that when the other superheroes change, they do so in spite of Miles, and not because of him.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate because Miles, unlike Nick, is a good kid in this film, despite his lack of motivation. He's not unlikeable - he's just unfocused. It's a consequence of the writing. There's a clear gap between the scared and inattentive Miles through most of the film and the sudden completely-in-control hero who dominates in the last five minutes. The mastery of his skills comes to him suddenly and without reason, which was frustrating because of the care taken in most other aspects of the film. Seeing him actually choose to change in that way would have been so satisfying.<br/><br/>There are a lot of positives to take from ""Into The Spider-Verse."" It is a bold-looking film that takes a lot of chances, including some very real stakes on both sides. I just wish the characters, particularly Miles, were handled the same way."

","REVIEW - SPIDER MAN - INTO THE SPIDER VERSE<br/><br/>After watching the trailer for this animated film I honestly wasn't looking forward to watching it. Now one thing I've learned doing these reviews is never judge a film on the trailer because naturally in the trailer it will show clips from some of the best scenes but of course in some films these are literally the only best bits.<br/><br/>So this film started and your sitting there expecting to see Spider Man, but....... (no spoilers).<br/><br/>If you can imagine a comic coming to the big screen then this doesn't even do this film justice, great story, great animation, acting or should I say voice over, funny in places and most importantly this film pays homage to the original Spider Man films directed by Sam Rami and ignores all of the re makes, revamps and Spider Mans Tony Stark suit!<br/><br/>So yes for the original fans of Spider Man this is a must go see.<br/><br/>My personal only gripe with this film was the ham Spider Pig and I'm not referring to The Simpsons movie either, there was just no need for hamny.<br/><br/>Generally a great film, if you don't see it at the cinema then get it at your first opportunity on streaming, especially us older Spider Man fans (try saying that 10 times as fast as you can).<br/><br/>Rating 8 out of 10 (would be 9 out of 10 if it wasn't for Spider Pig)"

","If one day you want to see an entertaining movie, with a good story, humor, and a bit of drama, this is the right movie. Spider-Man has had good movies with iconic actors, but this is definitely the best: it has an incredible cast, an interesting double and let's not talk about the soundtracks, after watching the movie you won't be able to get out of your mind the ton of the song Sunflower - Post Malone, Swae Lee, walk with that song and you will feel that you are Spiderman. Like all Stan Lee creations, this one cannot be excluded from being brilliant. Unfortunately, this movie is a dedication to this great comic writer since he passed away before the premiere.<br/><br/>But now let's talk about the reason the movie won an Oscar: the most riveting animation a Sony movie has ever had. It is as if you were reading a comic that runs alone, it is impressive the level of detail that each of the characters has, the setting, the locations and the comic expressions. It is as if you can see the leaves on your screen.
And do you know the best part of this? It was made by a group of animators graduated from Tec de Monterrey in Mexico, it is a Mexican job! All the credit was taken by the producers of the film, but in reality those who do the magic of representing a whole story in drawings to later become the film are the animators, they make it possible for Miles Morales to have life. Let's continue the work of this group of animators is spectacular!!"

"quiqueperezsoler","10","0","1","12 May 2020"," True believers, here's a love letter for you. The quintessential portrayal of what it means to be Spider-Man. Anybody can be Spider-Man.
","2018 was the ""Spider-Year"" due to the arrival of two critically acclaimed media like this movie, the Marvel's Spider-man PS4 game and even the arrival of Avengers' Infinity War. It was the year were every normal and diehard fan of Spider-man was delighted with stories that not only respected the source material but modernised it not only in plot but also in style.<br/><br/>It's hard to point out the good things in this movie because it basically is a perfect picture for its genres. It's an incredible ground-breaking animated feature with jaw-dropping 2D/3D effects blend and a comic-pop art style that serves as basis of every little nuanced and subtle animation cue. It's an incredible story because, despit its whacky premise and supporting characters, it still tells a story that's relatable and well-realised. It's a faithful Spider-man story because while it make new choices regarding main protagonists and supporting characters that only comic book fans would know about, it still manages to tell a story about identity, about self-confidence, about acceptance and doing the right thing without being overwhelming.<br/><br/>The balance of tone, plot flow/pace, character arcs and action is so perfect that it leaves little to no room for mistakes. The quips land every time with a fresh and grounded comedic timing and jokes that never get tired because it's at the expense of the unbelievable scenarios presented. The city of New York is mesmerizingly well-realised and vibrant with an urban touch that matches the main character upbringing spectacularly well. No sequence is a waste, all of them serve a purpose to either the story or the character growth, from the school classes to the villain conversations. Going one by one would take an entire essay compiling from the very small details in the animation technique to the outstanding double entendres of many jokes and plot points.<br/><br/>However, it's worth mentioning that it is commendable not only the animation but the writting in this movie. Not only is the story self-aware and engaging but it's loyalty to not a single unique piece of source material but rather a mash-up of many different bits of the old and new Spider-man comics to create an entire new story that pays homage to past Spider-man movies and Tv shows as well as provide a very SPider-man-like story through another character that is based on a comic, is really honoring. The issues with recent Spider-man films were that despite how the core of the character and his world was well captured, the modifications to the characters and many of the quirks took the fans out of it and made them see through a different lense of ""acceptance"" but already seeing it as yet another interpretation of Spider-man. THis movie broke everything, it didn't give an interpretation it capture the most authentic Spider-man interpretation of not only Peter Parker's version but also the image there was of him as well as his failures while still introducing new characters in the most wholesome way. This movie pathed the legacy of Spider-man, it took aside its main character and the tired trope of seeing him learn from his uncle's death to see the same sort of message through a different character.<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, if your are a fan of animation here you'll find an outstanding stylised aesthetic worth analysing, if you are also a Spider-man fan you'll find new characters and a uniquely sefl-contained adaptation of a Spider-Man comic, all in all, a faithful-to-the-bone portrayal of what reading a Spider-man comic book feels like. As a diehard Spider-Man fan... You are in for a treat, a love letter from the writters, animators and comic book figures from Marvel that got involved in the project. This movie is not Sony doing Spider-man, is the creators, is Stan Lee, is everyone that ever cared for the old and the new Spider-man crafting a new, refreshing, aesthetically enhancing tale of a yet another kid like Spider-man that wants to follow his steps but also needs to find out who he is. Anybody can be Spider-man."

And, they definietly did their homework on how to turn your movie into a living comic book. I won't spoil anything, but the story is something you have to see to believe.<br/><br/>I really have nothing negative to say about this film. I really don't.

","This movie is the most visually impressive movie I have ever seen, and it is no doubt the best Spider-Man movie. The movie clearly understands the character of Spider-Man. I very much like how they made Miles Morales not just a black Peter Parker. He has a love of art, and he initially doesn't want to be Spider-Man. The movie has a very good sense of humor. I found myself cracking up more times than once. I honestly have no idea how one guy thinks that the animation is bad. It is incredible, the fact that Miles was animated with 16 fps before his leap of faith, where he was animated by 24 fps. The movie's central moral is, anyone can be a hero. You don't need superpowers to save people. In the wise words of Stan Lee, ''That person who helps other simply because it should or must be done, and because it is the right thing to do, is indeed without a doubt, a real superhero.''
I just have nothing else to say. It's just flawless."
"kermitkid","10","0","2","31 March 2020"," It beat Disney and deserved to!
","Last year, I said that ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" was the best Spider-Man movie ever. I was wrong. This is! It has the perfect amount of action, drama, and comedy. Allegedly, the directors, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, were fired from the Han Solo movie because their vision was ""too comedic."" This movie proves they can balance drama and comedy perfectly, and I'm hoping this film opens the floodgates for them with other studios wanting to hire them. The animation took some getting used too as it is computer-animated, but meant to look like a comic book not quite completely CGI, but not quite completely hand-drawn either. What was clever about this very unique animation style was in certain close-up shots you could see the little dots that you would see in the pages of a comic book if you zoomed in with a magnifying glass. This movie already blew my mind, but if it had come out when I was 6, it would have blown my mind even more so. This is the Spider-Man movie I would have wanted as a kid, and I can't help but feel jealous of kids today who are my age when the original Spider-Man movie came out in 2002. The backstories for the various Spider-people are told very well, and even if you're not familiar with all the various iterations of the character, you still don't feel lost. (and this movie barely scratches the surface of the Spider-Man lore. There are still many, many, versions of Spider-Man that can be touched on, and I look forward to seeing them in the sequel). This is perfect for kids and adults! If this is not nominated for an Oscar next year, something is wrong with the Academy. There was absolute nothing about this movie to complain about!

When I heard this film had a 97 percent on RT, I was shocked. A Spider-Man movie with a 97% and everyone including some random dude chanting in a Apex Legends lobby screaming INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE RULES!? My friend (who is a freaking legend) gave me a copy of Into the Spider-Verse and when I went home, I instantly watched it. I then proceeded to say ""Wow"" and thought it was the best Spider-Man. Several months later and rewatching it several times, Yeah, This isn't the best Spider-Man (not even close). This film has several flaws that kinda hurts it for me. 1. Dr. Ock sucks. I disliked Dr. Ock in this film, I question her motive and I questioned even more about how did she end up like this? 2. A pig Spider-Man? Really? Okay, I'm kidding about that, that isn't a flaw, Although, I still question out of all the Spider-Mans, Why this one? 3. Aunt May feels out of place. 4. Several origin stories feel somewhat rushed. 5. The self-awareness just doesn't work. 6. Most of the Jokes feel out of place.
Overall, I say this is a solid 7/10, because some jokes were funny, the voice acting was awesome, and the soundtrack was almost as good as TASM2's soundtrack, which is my favorite Spider-Man film and soundtrack."

It's not only one of my favourite comic-book films of all time, but it's currently in my top thirty films ever made.<br/><br/>My favourite thing about Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse is the way that it looks visually. Every single shot is stunning, vibrant, and full of colour. I also loved how they set it up to look like the events on-screen were being pulled directly from an actual comic book, with thought bubbles, time and location boxes, and sounds that the characters were making.<br/><br/>The narrative was constantly compelling, with an extraordinary screenplay and a villain which I genuinely felt for. What he was doing was evil, but, at the heart of it, he was a broken man and just wanted to see his family again. This brought so much depth to the character of Kingpin, which made the narrative all the more personal.<br/><br/>Seeing all of the versions of Spider-Man from the different universes was extremely fun, and the interaction between them was engaging.

Everyone's actions and motivations are relatable and understandable as well. The audience is able to connect with any character better than most movies I've seen.<br/><br/>Did I mention how beautiful the film is? The visuals and soundtrack go hand in hand. This decision to animate this movie like a comic book is well appreciated. Also loved the great variation style/sound with each character. It's amazing how the soundtrack blends with each character.<br/><br/>5/5. Definitely deserves its place among one of the best Spider-Man movies out there.<br/><br/>PS: Amazing post-credit scene btw.

","I guess I get this but do we need to keep making the same film over and over again with a new twist? It's fun and entertaining but not for me."
"Offworld_Colony","10","0","1","10 February 2020"," I think that it's impossible to not like something in Into the Spider-Verse.
","Despite being touted as a Lord/Miller return project, with what seems to be little of their actual involvement, the real star is the incredible editing and overload of visual styles and the completely relatable and believable (but not forced) characterisation of mixed-race star of Miles Morales.
Into the Spider-Verse is (obviously) a hilarious, creative, exciting, surprising and engaging elseworld fusion and re-invention of Spider-Man, and while they had to go animated to give a mixed-race Spider-Man his due (and some strong, feminine, and different female characters as well), it may have completely done Morales justice. Free of the shackles of Raimi's live-action post-9/11 America-pandering version of Spider-Man, Spider-Verse is allowed to make something clever out of the whole time-paradox-rebootquel trend popularised by 2009's Star Trek - except here it's deftly handled, gentle and most of all, fun; rife for easter eggs and appropriate fan-service; I for one, actually cheered, when I saw the videogame costume in the lair, and the bubbles and comic styles all just gel.
The voice cast is superb, for this reason: they are all great actors but the characters felt entirely like characters, and unlike something from Dreamworks where the characterisations hinge entirely on you recognising the actor's star power, in Spider-Verse I never felt the need to it half way through, I just felt how real these people were. My girlfriend, at the tease of the other Spider-People, said, with a real surprise and light in her eyes: ""There's a female Spider-Man??!!"" and I realised that I took for granted that I already knew who Spider-Gwen was, and also how powerful it was to see her, and how little I cared whether the Spider-Person was in fact a man or not. In-fact I'd kill to see a live-action Spider-Woman film.
So this film is truly one for fans and one for noobs, and that's rare, I think my partner would have loved it even without me pointing out that I owned the Spider-Noir comic book and without pointing out that, yes, Wilson Fisk is that big in the comics (sometimes), or a myriad of little things that I don't know how I know.
More impactful than anything for me though was that the final fight, when he's all 'alone', was the most tense end fight in the usually predictable, numbing and inevitable superhero final fights. Whereas by the end of most superhero films, the hero has built himself up to win, in Verse, Miles has only just got himself ready to start, in a film that starts with the actual killing of a universe's Spider-Man, you really don't know what it can do, and with a Miles Morales who has only just found himself, and who's an actual kid instead of a thirty-something-year old actor playing a kid, it's nail-biting stuff.
I read an article about how the Spider-Man from the start is the idealised version of Spider-Man, the brand version; perfect, the whole of everything, unrealistic, unreachable. And where that Spider-Man could do it all, it takes the team of Spider-People from different universes, each with their different skills to come together and support each other. More pointedly, The Peter B Parker (B for Ben?) is the hero we can be, he's flawed, he has the same problems as we do, he's neither immaculate, nor immune to the trappings of life, he's the flawed hero, and he's from the main Marvel universe. 'Our' universe. I think that's quite powerful, and certainly a bold decision and one we may never see in a Spider-Man film ever again."
"Andy_MJD","10","0","1","4 February 2020"," One of the best superhero movies of all time
","As the title says, it's also one of the best animations out there.
This film is overflowing personality, from the characters, to their visual designs, their aimations, their voices; the way the music ties into it (leitmotifs woooo; thematically relevant music), the settings, the animation style and techniques, the EVERYTHING.<br/><br/>I love this movie."
"filipemanuelneto","9","0","1","2 February 2020"," Truly original.
","I thought I had seen almost everything I could see in relation to Spider-Man, because he is one of those characters who insists on returning to the cinema with some regularity. To make matters worse, the industry, and particularly Marvel, flooded theaters with films about cartoon characters, from the most famous to the most obscure, and this became repetitive, trivializing the genre.<br/><br/>But this film has nothing to do with the others. In fact, instead of following the path of ultra-realism that other animated films have followed or limited to being a spin-off or reissue of the character's story, the film transports us totally to the world of comic books, assuming for you that stylized look that these publications have, and bringing a totally new and different story, with an African American Spider-Man who tries to succeed the original, after witnessing his death, and save the world from destruction with the help of several versions of the hero from various parallel universes. Even the famous Spider Pig (even those who have never seen the Simpsons know) will appear!<br/><br/>The film features several famous actors who give the voice to the various characters (Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Mahershala Ali, Hailee Steinfeld, Nicolas Cage etc.) and is visually impressive, full of effects taken from the comic books on paper and a CGI state-of-the-art. The sound is also impressive, both in the action scenes and in relation to the soundtrack, where Hip Hop and suburban rhythms predominate. The pace of the film is quite fast, with breathtaking scenes.<br/><br/>I had little expectations when I went to see this film, but I have to admit that it is truly exceptional. However, it turns out to be so bold and so different from the ordinary that this can make it indigestible to some audiences."

","What can I say? Major Spider-Man fan here, and I feel like this movie has gotten the closest to Spider-Man of the comics, whom I love and adore, the closest. Lemme explain.<br/><br/>Unlike the dumb ""Spider-Totems"" thing in the comics nowadays, this movie shows the true idea of Spider-Man: that heroism and responsibility are not exclusive to people. We can fall from grace, lose a friend, be out of our time, or be misjudged, or face the unknown. Yet these challenges will not get in the way of what is right.<br/><br/>What is great:
-This is the best rendition of Peter Parker, bar none. I love the Raimi Spider-Man films, but man. This shows the struggling, yet mature and idealistic Spider-Man I love that Stan Lee crafted.
-Miles is improved in this adaption 10-fold. Unlike his comic rendition, he is satisfying to follow along. I loved the story with his father and uncle and how it contrasts with Peter. He has good and bad influences and ultimately has to find who to gravitate toward.
-Gwen Stacy proves to be a very satisfying individual with her own hurt. Her costume, like in the comics, kicks major butt. She's clever and complex.
-Good gosh, Doc Ock threw me off guard. She is the perfect Doc Ock in any of the non-comic renditions. Sassy, smart, yet horrendously evil and revels in it. If she was only the chubby male nerd, she'd be a 1:1 rendition of the comic version. But she doesn't have to be, because she on her own right thoroughly entertained me.
-I liked Kingpin and his family stuff.
-I knew Prowler's twist was coming, but it still hit me hard. Had to keep my mouth shushed for my brother in the theater, and it surprised him.
-Can I just say, this is how you do the comic book art style right? I know the 2003 hulk tried and failed miserably, and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man shot scenes that resembled comic panels. But this got the style and fluidity of comic books correct.<br/><br/>The cons (mostly nitpicks!):
-Frankly, every other villain has bad design choice (Scorpion, green goblin) or just feels underutilized (Tombstone).
-SPID//ER and Peni Parker feel kinda just there. Wish they had more to do.
-The final fight between Miles and Kingpin feels very anti-climatic to me. Miles' venom blast may be his signature move, but man it is not satisfying.
-Gwen's explanation of getting to the city before everyone else feels far-fetched and overly complicated.
-I'm one of the few people who doesn't like the soundtrack. Really not my thing, and it doesn't add to the film."

","I'm late to this party. My son kept asking me to watch and I just wasn't feeling it based on the description. I get it. The Spiderman franchise was getting a little stale and looking for a younger more diverse audience. Enter our teenage hero Miles who admittedly I was wrong to think was miscast.<br/><br/>Now stay with me here because I'm admitting I was wrong but when I first heard/read Spider-Man would now be an African American teenager I kind of eye rolled. Why? Well, what would you think if Black Panthers sequel was recast as a white teen from the suburbs? I'm sure it would illicit eye rolls plus. Well, sometimes you have to eat crow and admit you're wrong. This reimagining is done terrifically. After two minutes I forgot I was watching an animated movie. The writing is hilarious and relatable. The action scenes are unlike any I have ever witnessed in an animated movie. And Miles (Spider-Man) is amazing as he comes into his own. I loved the storyline between him and his uncle. As well as the welcome addition of a more traditional Spidey from far, far away...here to mentor young Miles as he navigates his new-found powers and teenager angst.<br/><br/>This movie begs for s sequel or a Netflix series. I enjoyed it more than any of the big box office blockbusters and my son has watched it dozens of times. We even got my wife to watch...trust me, that's an accomplishment. So, c'mon Netflix/Sony.....Get on it.....we're waiting."

","This is my favourite animation style ever. These guys have really outdone themselves. Every image jumps of the screen and the comic look was an amazing decision. When it comes to the other stuff, I loved Miles. He felt so real and that's the best way to describe his character. I really liked his relationship with his family and Peter Parker. The older and more experienced Peter was the other thing I really liked about the movie. He was great and added a lot to the story. My biggest problem is that the movie never gets as serious as I would like it too. Maybe it's because of the lack of consequences in the Marvel spider-man movies but I really want to see a movie that explores the core problems and moral dilemmas of being spider-man in a more serious manner but maybe that's just me. Anyways Miles is my favourite version of Spider-Man on screen (not counting the PS4 game because that's the best spidey for me), I freaking loved the visuals and animation, and the main theme of how anyone can be under the mask is great. That's truly spider-man."

I kept thinking this movie must have an amazing twist coming up that turns an ordinary film into a work of genius (like 'The Usual Suspects'). It didn't. I felt a little ripped off.<br/><br/>The movie looks great, has a great soundtrack and a clever concept. It's an immaculately put together package.

Otherwise I found the voice work pretty uninspired.<br/><br/>I would have liked it to be funnier. It often tries for humour, but comes up short more often than not. I was looking for something more like 'The Lego Batman Movie' where you hadn't finished laughing at one joke before they were throwing another one at you. Listen this movie is fine, perhaps even well above average, but don't be fooled into thinking it is some kind of masterpiece."

","I don't have anything against dark and gritty comic book movies, but there is certainly plenty of room for colorful popcorn entertainment in the space (a space I'm largely over).<br/><br/>Our central character, Miles Morales, is great. He's got a great mix of self-doubt, impulses towards heroism, and everyman awkwardness to make him both likeable and someone to root for when he gets bitten by his radioactive spider (from the multi-verse, I guess). He, combined with the fun and light tone that pushes the story forward, really makes the movie a good time, despite some flaws.<br/><br/>The biggest flaw really is the character of his uncle. He's introduced early as one of two father figures Miles has (the uncle and his actual father). The uncle lives his own life by his own rules, taking Miles to graffiti different spots around New York. His one scene with Miles is actually quite nice, but, SPOILERS, he turns out to be one of about 5 bad guys in the movie. He then dies super quickly after that, at about the halfway point of the movie. The build up of the uncle as a character is too short, and the death happens too early to really be of any real emotional value, undermining the emotional turning point of the movie because it's simply not strong enough.<br/><br/>This lends itself to the movie's other flaw, which is the overall busyness of it. There's a lot going on that acts as a distraction to the story. The multiple bad guys and the multiple versions of Spider-Man (who are mostly quite enjoyable in the small bits we get) combine to create chaos that distracts from Miles' actual story, which I really like overall.<br/><br/>The core of Miles' story is his relationship with his father, though. The uncle is a sideshow, ultimately, a means to getting the deep emotional moment between father and son that Miles needs in order to go from bumbling amateur to the next real Spider-Man. It's fine as a narrative technique, but the uncle just simply isn't handled well enough.<br/><br/>Gosh, I tend to complain about movies that I do actually enjoy, but the thing is I found this movie good, but not great, and I wanted it to be great. So, when I see the movie make, what I believe to be, rather simple missteps, my mind jumps into overdrive about what could have been done to fix it.<br/><br/>And yet, I really do enjoy the whole package. The color schemes (the pinks, blues, and greens) are a refreshing change of pace. The light tone is fun. The ending has a lot of imagination going for it as multiple versions of New York begin to manifest in the same place. The central story (a modestly well done hero journey wrapped up in fancy clothes) is handled well, and Miles is a great central character. The other Spider-Men are pretty universally fun. Gosh...I largely just wished they had worked that uncle character into the movie better."

","So many have commented, so I will be brief. From an intriguing plot to wonderful characterizations using drop dead animation, this film works. About ten minutes into it it thought, ""This is just a kind of hip hop version of Spiderman."" But the main character is suddenly thrust into a world which he must learn quickly to manage. The canon takes a turn here toward incredible creativity. I avoid mainstream animation, but this has restored my faith."

"kenobio-68005","9","0","1","31 October 2019"," Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse
","Spider-Man : Into the Spider-Verse is a spot-on animated movie and probably the best Spider-Man movie.<br/><br/>The movie talks about Miles Morales, a young Afro-American from Brooklyn who just entered pension in a new school. One day, while tagging walls with his uncle Aaron, with whom he has a strong relationship, he is beaten by what seems to be a weird spider. He soon realizes that he has been gifted by arachnid's powers. One night, he escapes from the school and he encounters Spider-Man fighting in a testing room run by Wilson Fisk, who kills the spider once and for all. A failed experience creates a near ressemblance to a portal and strange events happens in the city, as it mourns Spider-Man's death. Miles soon encounters different people having the same abilities than him but from different dimension, who arrived from the portal : Peter B. Parker, a student he had seen previously in his class called Gwen Stacy, Spider-Man Noir, Peter Porker and Peni Parker. The new Peter Parker teaches Miles how to become a proper Spider-Man, and with the help of their friends, team up against Fisk and a new villain running in town, The Prowler.<br/><br/>The cast of voice actors truly lines up well with the fluid animation. Shameik Moore, portraying Miles, reflets the character's youth and thirst of liberty. Jake Johnson's depressive and nearly retired Peter B. Parker highlights the difference with Chris Pine's hopeful and optimistic Peter Parker. Nicholas Cage, Kimiko Glenn and John Mulaney, even being side characters, portray very nicely their comic or tragic personalities. Liev Schreiber as Wilson Fisk, Kathryn Hahn as Olivia Octivius, and the incredible Mahershala Ali as The Prowler, express their emotions though their perfidious and evil personalities.<br/><br/>The movie is an incredible movie emotionally, having touches of fun throughout the story, balancing with Peter B. Parker's tragic backstory and has a powerful family relationship. It truly deserves the Oscar it received for Best Animated movie."

","I'd like to start this review off by saying that this film probably has some of the best computer animation in film history. It perfectly captures the feel of reading a comic book. The movie also is quite funny throughout, with some jokes that still make me laugh after watching at least 10 times. However, this movie is not perfect.<br/><br/>The licensed music used in this film would either make or break a scene. An example of it making a scene great would be the use of Post Malone and Swae Lee's Sunflower in Miles' introduction. It helps us understand that Miles is just a normal teenager living in the modern age. But there is also the scene where the news reports on Peter Parker's death. The music choice here is extremely obnoxious considering the serious nature of the scene.<br/><br/>Also, while I praised the comedy in this movie, I personally found all of Bill Hader's character's one-liners to be annoying.<br/><br/>The only other issue I had came near the end of the movie when Miles finally gains control over his powers. While Miles prepares to take his ""leap of faith"" off of the side of a building, there are quotes playing in the background to reflect what is going through Miles' head. The problem being that there are quotes being played that we just heard less than five minutes prior. I'm sure I don't need to explain why that's incredibly dumb.<br/><br/>While I have spoken at length about my problems with this film, it is still an incredibly enjoyable experience. I'd still recommend this movie to almost anyone, although I feel it's a tad bit overrated."

","Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse
RATING: 4.4/5<br/><br/>This movie puts the last 10 years of Disney animated features to absolute shame. It's crazy how overly stylized this movie is, it really just oozes creativity. The offbeat frame rate is a stylistic choice that really helps sell the fact that you're watching a comic book movie, and it doesn't take long to get used to it either IMO. I saw it in IMAX 3D and at first I thought there was something wrong with the film quality but it turns out it's actually all colored like a classic comic, dots and everything.<br/><br/>The movie does move kinda fast but it does take the time to explain all the different Spider-Man characters you're seeing. Interestingly enough, it brings up how long each different Spider-Man character has been doing the superhero thing too. By doing that, you get to see the difference between a character who just got their powers and doesn't know how to use them, versus one who's been doing it for years, or decades, and is a veteran who's seen it all. It's a great contrast, with my favorite being the older, very jaded, Peter Parker that they show in the trailers. He's been around the block so many times that he knows villain plots by heart, so he's very nonchalant about everything. It's a pretty fresh, and funny, take on the character. The star here is Miles Morales, of course, and I have to say he's handled quite well, even his family.<br/><br/>If I had to say anything negative about the film, it's that not every character gets used to their full potential. There came a point where I just noticed there were a lot of spider people fighting villains that hadn't really been fleshed out at all. The film could have probably used another 10 to 15 minutes just to doll out some basic characterization to some of the villains, and even some of the spider characters. The spiders all have their own personal issues, but the only one that really gets addressed is the older Peter Parker. Something even happens late in the film that is presented in such a way that it implies something significant just happened. However, the ground work is never properly laid for it to mean anything to the audience, so the moment just kind of awkwardly lingers.<br/><br/>Outside those minor complaints, this is definitely a good, you could even argue great, movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen. There's a level of craftsmanship and creativity here that you just don't see in movies in general anymore. The film has a lot of heart, you can tell the creators really cared about what they were making here, and it wasn't just a cash grab. Be warned, you may get hit with some emotional moments in this film, even Stan Lee's cameo was sad, despite it being funny as well. The film has a very positive message about being good and doing good that I think the world needs to hear more of these days. Definitely one of the best films of the year.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and stay until after the credits. There's a pretty clever Spider-Man joke at the very end."

"Floated2","10","0","1","1 August 2019"," Visually stunning and exceeds expectations
","Having heard much praise about this film since its release and seeing its high ratings on both Rotten tomatoes and Metacritic, and seeing as it was nominated for several Oscars (and won one). Expectations were only set quite high.<br/><br/>After watching this film, can safely say that these expectations were met. First off the visuals are top notch, the colours are flashy and bright, and the overall animation is incredible. The story is written well and is pretty clever, not just a typical Spider-Man film. The different Spider-People were a nice touch seeing them from these different dimensions, and they were all quite likeable, unique and different. The main older ""past prime"" Spider was probably the best, in terms of content, and the voice work by Jake Johnson stood out. Initially did not know he was the voice but during the film, figured it was him.<br/><br/>The action and pacing is also really well done, as the film doesn't get boring and even during its slower scenes, the dialogue is either witty or the music soundtrack plays accordingly and fits in perfect with the image of the film. This is one complaint I have seen from people, saying they did not like the type of hip-hop being played throughout the film and how it was too much, but it fits with the narrative and stereotype. Most of all it works.<br/><br/>One negative is that the film could have actually been longer. The run time is less than two hours and the end credits are over 11 minutes long. So the film is really about 1 hour 45 minutes. Also the Uncle Aaron could have had more screen time as he was an interesting character. Otherwise this was a really well done film and one of the best animated films of its time."

"ShanTeaTime","9","0","1","20 July 2019"," Animation as it should be! ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is visually stunning and smart!
","""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is an animated superhero film featuring the Marvel Comics character Miles Morales / Spider-Man. It's the first animated feature film in the Spider-Man franchise, and is set in a shared multiverse called the ""Spider-Verse"", which has alternate universes. In the film, Miles Morales joins other Spider-Men from various dimensions who team up to save New York City from Kingpin.<br/><br/>I CANNOT believe I pushed this film off for so long! It was one of my most anticipated films of 2018 and I missed it completely! Ugh I'm so upset that I didn't get to see this on a theatre screen, I knew the animation style was stunning from the first teaser trailer and I was right! Seriously though, the visuals in this animated film are some of the best I've seen in awhile. It's pretty amazing. One fact I found out from a YouTube video about the animation was that certain characters fream-rates vary from other in action sequences. A more seasoned Spider-Man like Peter Parker has a more smooth frame-rate, whereas Miles is more inexperienced so his frame-rate is lower compared.<br/><br/>This added idea makes me so happy and what I prefer in animation. This is what animation should aim to be. We get past movie references (yes hand guns!), stunning action sequences, vibrant city scapes, BAGEL and so much more. I noticed a blatant Nike endorsement in this film, which I found kind of funny. Wonder how much they paid to be in a Spider-Man film? We also get various versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Gwen and Spider-Man Noir played hilariously by Nicholas Cage. There's so much personality in this film, coupled with a pretty badass soundtrack to back it up.<br/><br/>So the humor in this actually had me laughing my booty off at certain points, it catches you so off guard! I caught myself asking ""why is Peter blonde?"" at the beginning and then, oh my god they poke fun at it! I was dying because I spoke too soon man! This movie is too good, thank you screenwriters for making an animated film without cringey ""humor"" dialogue. Continuing with the plot though, I called the uncle working for Kingpin as soon as Miles showed up in his apartment in suit! Bare in mind I don't really know much about Mile's Spider-Man so avid fans probably knew he was the Prowler already.<br/><br/>So I loved the parallel comparison between all of the Spider heroes, apparently everyone has got to have someone die in their story! Uncle Ben, friend Peter, Uncle Aaron, etc. But all of the characters are distinct enough too, so it's not repetitive and always circles back to Miles. The only negative I could come up with is I don't really care about Kingpin as a villain. He just doesn't interest me and I would've rather seen a tag-team of other classic villains. But this is more about the various Spider heroes, unlike the many live-action movies. Those kind of really on great villain acting (Doc Oc, Green Goblin, Vulture, Mysterio more recently, etc) which isn't bad, but Spider-Man has never thrived as a character in any of those films. Until now that is!<br/><br/>Thank you academy for giving this film an Oscar, because it deserves it! Not just as an animated film, but a film in general. I can say its the best Spider-Man film we've had overall so far and I love the first 2 Sam Raimi films so I don't say this lightly! In style, humor and character development, it's a must see."

","Here's my review of Spiderman : Into the Spider verse. When I saw the trailer for this movie I wasn't impressed , in fact I thought it was a cashgrab from sony with the remaining rights for Spider-Man they have left. And I was wrong. The story is about different spider men / woman from different dimensions , it's also an origin movie for Miles morales' spiderman. For those of you who've watched the ultimate Spider-Man cartoon crossover, the characters might not be new to you but they're all just wayyyy better than the tv epsiode. The animation in this movie is like stop motion but with a very fast frame rate which you grow on with as the movie progresses. The artstyle is just super cool , it's like a comic book with the thinking boxes and the POW , BAM stuff ! . The movie has really good voice actors and a powerful soundtrack , cause sony ( duh) and yes ! Tons and tons of product placement . The humour in this movie is really good , it's the best I've seen in animated movies since Zootopia. The movie has loads of Easter eggs , fourth walls , one liners which makes your spider sense tingle. In the end , into the spiderverse was way beyond my expectations , with great characters , 4th wall breaking , a slick artstyle , great humour and everything you love about Spiderman . It's like if 90s Disney made a Spiderman movie that your kids will be watching on repeat mode , ten years down the line."

"olivercase-83355","10","0","1","18 July 2019"," One of few films I would call flawless.
","This beautifully animated masterpiece is something no-one would have expected from Sony animation. if you told me in early 2018 that one of the best films I would ever see is produced by Sony animation, I would laugh in your face and tell you - ""Funny, but let's return to reality"". The masterfully built screenplay is amazing, which I would expect from one of the lord brothers. This movie is able to make you cry and then laugh 2 minutes later, which sounds like tonal inconsistency, but somehow is pulled off. I would honestly compare this movie to the godfather as one of the best movies of all time and definitely the best animated film I've ever seen (though I haven't seen Spirited Away). If you haven't watched this film, you are simply missing out on an amazing experience."

","This is a great MOVIE period, not just a great COMIC BOOK MOVIE. You could have never picked up a comic book and still loved his film. The animation style is unbelievably refreshing and exhilarating. The emotional depth hits home for everyone, especially lovers of Spider-Man. The voice casting is flawless, it's easy to forget you are watching drawn characters and not real humans. There is not a single person I would not recommend this film to. If you haven't already seen this WHAT ARE YOU DOING? This really looks and feels like a comic book in motion. It's exciting from beginning to end, and I never wanted it to end.<br/><br/>I think the best part of this film (if I had to pick just one), is that the stakes FEEL real. Let's be honest, this is a nonsensical story about inter-dimensional travel and superheroes, but by the climax, I am worried for the characters' well-being, and never once stop to think ""oh that could never happen!""<br/><br/>I can't find a single flaw with this film. I'm sure Stan Lee would be Incredibly proud of how his greatest creation came to life in this iteration of Spider-Man. This animation had more life in it than any live-action superhero film to date.

"kikoydaba3","8","0","1","14 July 2019"," Spider-Verse is a worthy inclusion to the Spider-Man film franchise
","Spider-Verse is the comic Spider-Man brought to the big screen. Wonderfully animated beaming with psychedelic colors and a story with heart and emotion, Spider-Verse is a worthy inclusion to the Spider-Man film franchise and will be highly remembered for its originality, humor, layered characters and as a enjoyable fan-service.<br/><br/>Since Raimi's Spider-Man in 2002, we have been flooded with a torrent of films from the same character. One would be inclined to believe that the character has over time lost its luster because the same plot points and story has been rehashed. Sony has rebooted the franchise twice, giving the character three interpretations since then. Everybody knows the origin, Peter Parker gets bit by a radioactive spider that gives him superpowers such as augmented strength, agility, speed and wall crawling. The studio giving us these films have managed to deliver a different take that is better than most of its live-action catalog while retaining the aspects that make the character tick.<br/><br/>The story is about Miles Morales, a Afro-Hispanic kid who is accidentally gifted with the same powers of the original Spider-Man. When the villain Kingpin opens a hole in space that sucks in the same character from other parallel universes the heroes have to unite in order to return to their respective universes.<br/><br/>Despite the number of protagonists, Spider-Verse manages to balance character development and action. Miles Morales is an average kid who encounters the same problems that any kids face at his age; father-son relationship and sense of belonging. As the story progresses Morales is shown to have a different opinion on Spider-Man against his father. Because of his strained relationship with his father he seeks confirmation and guidance from his uncle whose realtionship with his brother is also strained. Morales gradually finds purpose in the Spider-Man persona, but these comes into conflict when it is revealed that his uncle is the killer who is chasing him. The other protagonists from the other dimensions are there to inject back stories that makes Morales accept his powers. The villain is also properly motivated instead of being a cardboard character who only serves to further the action without character growth.<br/><br/>The technical qualities of the film is not to be understated. With a soundtrack that matches the tone and visuals that directly borrow from the comic books Spider-Verse is a exhilarating ride from start to finish.<br/><br/>8/10"

","This film won an Oscar for a reason. Finally a studio is doing something new in animation instead of the same old CG. It's fresh, it's fun, it fits the genre of film.<br/><br/>The voice acting was also great and the interactions between Peter B Parker and Miles were priceless and fun.<br/><br/>My biggest qualm was probably the story. Granted, there isn't much you can do with the superhero genre anymore since the market is so saturated. But I would have liked to have seen more done with this film. Peter B Parker and Miles were fleshed out well, but the other incarnations of Spider-Man were a big lacking. Particularly Gwen. A lot of her motivations didn't make much sense, particularly why exactly she went to Miles's school.<br/><br/>Another downfall was the villain. Basic generic villain with basic generic villain backstory and motivations. This left the end battle scene lacking, as I didn't feel any stakes.<br/><br/>This all being said, it's still a great movie. I laughed, I cried, I was in awe at some parts...would definitely recommend."

","There have been a lot of Spider-man movies.<br/><br/>Just within the past fifteen years we've had three separate Spider-men in three different franchises. Everyone knows his origin story- (bit by radioactive spider, uncle Ben, with great power, date Mary Jane or Gwen Stacy, bla bla bla). Everyone knows his enemies (Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Venom, Vulture, or the malicious Blue Man Group member that Jamie Foxx played in ""Amazing Spiderman 2""...). As much as I like Spider-man (I'd say he's probably my favorite superhero) I do think that Spider-man's presence in pop culture has become a bit ubiquitous (all superheroes have, but Spidey seems to get the reboot treatment more than most). Before I went to go see this movie, I found myself asking the question: do we really need another version spider-man?<br/><br/>Apparently we did. We really did.<br/><br/>I never expected to be so excited about this, but I was. Honestly, I loved it so much that I'd recommend this movie to everyone. While this movie follows the tried and true superhero formula it does it in a way that is so tongue in cheek that it still feels incredibly refreshing. Aside from that, this movie is groundbreaking in terms of animation- it's worth seeing for that alone. It's a brilliant superhero film; heck, it's just a brilliant movie. This film dethrones ""Incredibles 2"" as my pick for Best Animated film of 2018.<br/><br/>For our full review of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and hundreds of other reviews, articles, and podcast episodes visit us at True Myth Media!"

","This was the best movie of 2018. Period, end of story. It says a lot that you can pause the movie at nearly any frame and have wallpaper art. Start it up almost anywhere and you'll laugh. I could watch this movie every day and keep finding things I didn't notice before for months. The characters are so relatable despite there only being ten minutes of screen time for some of them. Miles is far and away one of my favorite renditions of Spider-Man ever, and I love the little imperfections on each character model that make the characters subtly more human -- like Gwen's adorable gap in her teeth, Miles' weird eyes and Peter's misshapen nose. These are people, realized more perfectly in animation than they could be in real life. It makes me so happy to see animated movies come this far. I could just continue to gush about it for forever, but that would make an incoherent mess, so go watch the CinemaWins or really any review or essay on YouTube. Just let me say that this is probably one of the best animated movies ever made, definitely one of the best Spider-Man movies ever made (I think Sam Raimy's Spider-Man 2 is the only one that could unseat it), one of the best superhero movies ever made, and seriously just one of the best movies I've ever seen.

"spwilson-24170","10","0","1","28 June 2019"," I broke down.
","I've never been a huge fan of writing. As a student, I do enough of it for school, so why take time out of my day to write even more? This was the quandary I faced months ago when I first saw this movie. I just watched this movie again-for probably the eighth(?) time- and I've officially broken down. This movie impacted me so much that I created an account simply to write this review. To anyone reading this: if you have a heart, a soul, a fiber of your being capable of emotion, watch this film. If you want to leave now, I get it. This will be a long, comprehensive review. But know this: this movie is phenomenal and it should be studied, watched, and most importantly, enjoyed for years to come. There will also be spoilers sprinkled throughout
I grew up on comics. I literally couldn't get enough of Batman as a kid. But honestly, I never really liked Spiderman. I don't know why, but he just never really clicked. I saw the Sam Raimi movies as a kid, but I just thought they were ok. The Andrew Garfield movies....well let's just say I agreed with the general public. I really love Tom Holland in the MCU. But the Magnum Opus in my heart, the Pinnacle of all Spider-Men, will forever be Shameik Moore as Miles Morales. I've liked them, but I've never connected with a Spiderman movie until now. This movie is a comic book movie. No, let me rephrase that. This movie is a COMIC BOOK (movie). Nearly every frame has elements of a comic book, from the frames, to the colors, down to the onomatopoiea text bubbles. I'll get to the animation in a second, but the animators successfully made a comic book jump to life on screen.
The animation is nothing short of amazing. Obviously this is not a new opinion. Greater minds than mine have already discussed how incredibly well crafted this animation is. I say crafted because this wasn't made. This wasn't animation that a studio just threw money at mindless artists to make. This animation is imbued with care and love for the production as a whole as well as the source material.
The voice acting is nothing short of a miracle. Every actor fully understands their character, and it shows. Chris Pine perfectly sounds like the altruistic friendly neighborhood Spiderman that we all know. His voice exudes kindness and understanding when talking to Miles. He is OUR Spiderman. Shameik Moore perfectly portrays emotion throughout the film. When Aaron dies, you are forced to feel the emotion with Miles. He also sounds perfectly nervous during the shoulder touch scene with Gwen. The ackwardness of the lines make the viewer feel just as ackward as Miles, a feat done perfectly by Moore. Jake Johnson is the bad Spiderman. He is the Spiderman that we don't need, and kind of don't want. But Jake's voice delivery makes you feel his depression of losing MJ. Mahershala Ali and Brian Tyree Henry are a power duo of voice work that compliment each other. When dying, the prowler gives Miles a speech that the audience hears, but also feels. Through just his voice, we know the prowler is aware he's made mistakes and wishes he could do it over again, a skill that only a masterclass actor like Ali could muster. I don't cry at movies. It's not some macho thing or whatever, it's just that no movies have legitimately moved me to tears. Brian Tyree Henry changed that. When Jeff monologues to Miles through the closed door, I may have shed a gangster tear or two. The line ""Sometimes people just grow apart"" really hit me. Jeff knows that if he would have spent more time with Aaron, his brother wouldn't have gone down a life of crime; knowing this, he wants to prevent that life from Miles. Jeff holds back tears as he attempts to deliver the devastating news, and the audience can grasp his trauma through his emotion.
Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse has my second favorite soundtrack of all time. I say second because, I'm sorry, but no soundtrack will ever beat Guardians of the Galaxy, and that's final. The use of Sunflower paints Miles as just a regular kid who sings the lyrics to songs he barely knows, and everyone can relate to that. What's Up Danger? is probably my favorite song from this album, as its use is just the perfect backdrop for the epic moments onscreen. Scared of the Dark was also really nice because they only used the chorus, one that enstills in the audience a sort of gloom, which emphasizes that the world truly lost a hero when Spiderman died.
Lastly, I loved the goofs. This film perfectly divides comedy with serious emotion, and there's no emotional beat undercut by a cheap joke. The writers knew their limits and stuck to them. I think the one exception to this rule ended up being my favorite part of the movie, because it was done tastefully. The major fight between Miles and Kingpin stopped being a time for jokes when Miles just kept getting pummeled. It would be a smart call to not have any Spiderman quips and just show Miles' strength of will instead, but the film does both. Miles didn't have to do the shoulder touch/venom strike move, but it improves the scene. He could have had the same outcome by doing a variety of actual combat techniques, but this just felt right. Miles, in the moment, completed both his and Aaron's character arcs. By taking everyone's advice along the way, Miles became Spider-Man. Aaron's arc was completed by leaving Miles with a move that would avenge himself. Many of the jokes were absolutely hilarious, with many subtle ones that could gloss over some people (I think it's a Banksy). Spider-Ham, voiced by none other than John Mulaney, was completely over the top, and I loved it. Did Kingpin need to be inhumanly gigantic? Absolutely not. Did I feel that it was a weird, but bold cinematic choice that overall improved the movie? Definitely. Nic Cage...is just Nic Cage. He was the perfect cast for the material given, and I can't emphasize enough how much I loved him in this movie.
I know this was a really long review, but I truly spilled my heart and my soul into this, much like how I feel the creators did on this film. I hope you enjoyed this review, and I hope you loved this movie. If you didn't see this movie, even though I spoiled it, go watch it. It is a cinematic masterpiece that is nothing short of spectacular."

"Dragoneagle144","10","0","1","24 June 2019"," The Best Spider-Man Movie So Far
","Into the Spider-verse is one of the best movies of the year. The characters and story are so fleshed out with each of the Spider-people feeling unique from one another and interesting on their own. The thing that really elevates this film though is the incredible style and animation. The animation is themed to look like a comic book with thought bubbles, sound effects, and other things like that showing up in the movie. That style pays off enormously for the film as a whole. The pace of this movie is so fast that it reminds me of an Edgar Wright film which is never a bad thing. The soundtrack is also unbelievably spectacular and makes the film even easier to watch than it already was. This might be my favorite Spider-man movie which is really saying something because I absolutely adore Homecoming. This film works on every level and should be seen by everyone especially if you are a fan of the character."
"iguth","10","0","1","20 June 2019"," Modern, unique, and 'incredible'
","This is by far the best Spider-Man movie of all of them. The art style is so incredibly unique in how it utilizes aspects from comic books. Not only that but the entire film is dotted in most scenes or textured in other ways akin to the tv show Chowder. The next thing you notice in this movie is the sound, more specifically, the music. The music is amazing and perfectly fits every scene throughout. Not only that but the fact that so much of the music is Post Malone fits perfectly with Miles Morales' life and character within the film. It also creates a very modern feeling that other movies lack. The level of absurdity is great and totally works with the animation and plot. This even allows for some great humor moments. Even throughout the absurdity and fast-paced animation style, the movie still manages to hold onto a meaningful and well thought out spiderman origin story with amazing characters that are incredibly well developed. Even the villain has a good motive with an extreme plan fueled by emotion, a good trope in any movie really. Lastly I will address the thing that most people talk about, a black Spider-Man. I will say that unlike other movies, this movie does diversity right. Miles' culture and heritage does play a role in the movie and is clearly visible to the audience, however, nothing about the plot revolves around his race and culture. He's not 'black Spider-Man' but he is Miles Morales, a character that proves to the world that anyone can be a hero with enough determination."

The psychedelic part is way over the top and it does not work the way the animations of the 1970s worked.<br/><br/>To make things worse, I am seeing it one day after Spider Man Homecoming, which was an excellent movie.

"PotassiumMan","10","0","1","11 May 2019"," Kaleidoscopic, riveting game changer in the animation genre
","I saw this film on the tail end of its theatrical release, and what a discovery it was. A visceral screenplay and electric animation guide this high-energy, uplifting story about a New York City teenager who by chance becomes one of the many Spiderheroes in the world and his life is never the same afterward.<br/><br/>The protagonist is a modest but savvy kid who has a diverse range of influences in his life, from his law-and-order father to his more street-wise uncle. He winds up crossing paths with a number of superheroes each of whom has a unique style, but who also share a common goal- stopping an evil crime kingpin from opening a vast, destructive portal to another universe. There are themes of family challenges, building adult confidence and the importance of teamwork, all tied together in this amazing story. Although some of the climactic fight scenes do go on for quite a while (an endemic problem in the super hero genre) it doesn't take away from the film's impact.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing this on as big a medium as possible. Even though it's an animation film, watching this for the first time on your phone would be a mistake. The visuals are so intense, sometimes overpowering, that you want to get the full effect. A great film for children but with plenty of adult wisdom, this one is not to be missed. Highly recommended."

"stevenrotherforth","7","0","2","11 May 2019"," The third best Spidey movie!
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse<br/><br/>There's a lot of talk going around that this is the best Spider-Man movie ever made.
Whilst I can't agree with that statement (Spider-Man 2 still holds that trophy in my opinion) this animated offering is a fine addition to the Spidey franchise.
Produced by the talented duo Lord and Miller, Spider- Verse is fresh and exciting. It's a visual treat with a surprisingly good script and voice cast.
The animation is deserving of its Oscar as there's some inventive visuals that lend both to subtle comedy and aids the storytelling.
Spider-Verse looks wonderful in Hi-def.
Colours are bold and vibrant. Action scenes are comprehensive allowing the audience to fully immerse.
Whilst slower portions of the movie involving dialogue are witty and heartfelt.<br/><br/>The story tells of teenage Miles Morales who becomes Spider-Man in his own reality whilst crossing paths with many Spider-Men and women from alternate universes.
If you're not familiar with the comic books then you'll be thinking ""I thought Peter Parker was Spider-Man?""
Well, he is but this adventure proves that anyone can be the web slinger and there's much more to being Spidey than just donning the mask.<br/><br/>As aforementioned Spider-Verse is a visually engaging piece of entertainment that is backed up by a impressive sound mix and wonderful soundtrack.
This is a great movie to get you're Home Theatre system warmed up.
Surround effects are spacious and bass is deep and punchy helping the films score come to life.
Dialogue is always crisp and audible, never getting lost in the chaos of the action.<br/><br/>So how does this movie compare to its live action siblings?
I personally would put it behind Rami's second helping and Tom Holland's first outing.
Making this the third best Spidey movie.
I understand why it's been awarded such high praise but I prefer a live action movie.
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse does get a little too disconnected from reality at times ( a little too cartoonish) but this is not to say that it's not a magnificent movie.
One that I'm glad to own and one I will watch over and over again."
"leonblackwood","8","0","1","9 May 2019"," Great animation and storyline! 8/10
","Review:
When I heard they were making an animated version of Spider-Man for the big screen, I wasn't overly excited, but after watching a couple of trailers, I saw that they really took a chance with the unique style and concept of the film. It still didn't make me want to pay to see it on the big screen, so I waited for it to be released on Blu-ray, and I must admit, it was a great movie. The whole black Spider-Man concept was brilliantly put together, and I liked the family element throughout the film. The various Spider-Men & Women were great but it did take me some time to get used to the animation, which was done just like a comic book. The mannerisms and facial expressions of Miles Morales were brilliant, and the kingpin looked nuts but it really is the storyline which I have to give top marks. It did get a bit confusing when it came to the quantum leap concept because they seemed to be flying in and out of time, but apart from that, I really did enjoy it. The movie is about a teenager called Miles Morales, who struggles to live up to the expectations of his father, police officer Jefferson Davis, who sees Spider-Man as a menace. Miles changes to a boarding school, but he sneaks out and goes to his Uncle Aaron Davis house. When he takes Miles to an abandoned subway station to paint graffiti, Miles is bitten by a radioactive spider and gains spider-like abilities. Miles returns to the station to search for the spider and discovers a particle accelerator called ""The Super-Collider"" built by Wilson Fisk. Fisk hopes to access parallel universes to find alternative versions of his deceased wife and son, who died in a car crash after they found Fisk trying to kill Spider-Man. Spider-Man tried to disable the collider while fighting Fisk's enforcers, Green Goblin and Prowler. Spider-Man saves Miles and senses that they are alike. Green Goblin shoves Spider-Man into the collider, causing an explosion that kills Green Goblin. Wounded, Spider-Man gives Miles a USB drive to disable the accelerator and warns that the machine could destroy the city if activated. Miles watches in horror as Fisk kills Spider-Man, and flees from Prowler. Miles damages the hard drive whilst trying out his newfound abilities. At Spider-Man's grave, Miles meets Peter B. Parker, an older and worn down version of Spider-Man from another dimension. Upon meeting Peter, Miles inadvertently discovers a power to emit a bio-electric pulse to disable his victim. Peter reluctantly agrees to train Miles in exchange for help stealing data to create a new drive. In Fisk's research facility, Miles discovers he has the power to turn invisible. They are confronted by chief scientist Olivia Octavius, who reveals that Peter will die due to cellular decay if he stays longer in their dimension after taking DNA samples from Peter. Miles and Peter are rescued by Gwen Stacy, Spider-Woman from another dimension. They find Peter's aunt, May Parker, who is sheltering more heroes from other dimensions. Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Ham and Peni Parker are also deteriorating. Miles offers to disable the collider so the others can return home, but the heroes tell him he lacks experience. Miles retreats to Aaron's home, where he discovers that Aaron is the Prowler. He returns to May's house, where Peni has completed the drive, however, he is followed by Fisk, Prowler, Octavius, Scorpion and Tombstone, leading to a brawl. Miles flees, but is captured by Prowler and unmasks himself. Unwilling to kill Miles, Aaron is shot by Fisk. Miles flees with Aaron, but Aaron dies of his injuries. Jefferson sees Miles mourning over Aaron and concludes that Spider-Man killed him. The heroes regroup with Miles in his dorm. peter restrains Miles with his webs to ensure his safety before heading out with the heroes, choosing to sacrifice himself by staying behind and deactivating the collider. Miles masters his powers and goes to Aunt May's, where he gains web shooters and repairs Peter's suit. He joins the heroes and helps them defeat Fisk's enforcers before activating the USB drive and sending them home. Fisk and Miles fight throughout the collider and Miles paralyses Fisk with his venom blast and throws him at the kill switch, destroying the collider. Fisk and his enforcers are arrested and Jefferson recognises Spider-Man as a hero. Back in their home dimensions, the heroes return to their lives. Peter prepares to fix his relationship with Mary Jane, and Gwen finds a way to connect Miles across dimensions. It's definitely not a straight forward plot, but it makes more sense when you're watching it. The directors tried their utmost to stay close to the comics, which is why it was popular with the die-hard fans. Personally, I haven't read any of the comics but I still found the movie entertaining, and completely different from any of the movies. It wasn't made with young kids in mind, which is why it didn't smash the box office, and it's ""Street"" concept isn't for everyone, but there are many different elements that will satisfy all ages. I just hope that they carry on this animated franchise because it's one of the best Spider-Man adaptations that I have seen to date. Surprisingly Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by 3 different directors, who all brought there own fresh idea's to make this movie truly unique. The first director, Peter Ramsey brought you Rise of the Guardians in 2012, and he was a storyboard artist for movies like Predator 2, Backdraft, Far and Away, Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Shadow, Tank Girl, Batman Forever, Eye For An Eye, Independence Day, Men In Black, Godzilla, Edtv, Being John Malkovich, Fight Club, How The Grinch Stole Christmas, Cast Away, A.I., Panic Room, Minority Report, Adaptation, The Core, Spartan, Shark Tale, Penguins of Madagascar, Sausage Party and a Wrinkle in Time, so he has loads of experience when it comes to his profession. The second director, Bob Persichetti hasn't directed any other movies, but he was also a storyboard artist, and rough inbetweener, for Hercules, Mulan, Tarzan, Fantasia 2000, The Emperor's New Groove, Treasure Planet, Shrek 2, Shrek The Halls, Monsters vs. Aliens, Puss In Boots and the Little Prince in 2015, so he was perfect when it came to the animation department. The 3rd and final director, Rodney Rothman, produced Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Year One, Get Him To The Greek and The Five-Year Engagement, so he was obviously brought into the mix for his experience in the comedic world. He also wrote Grudge Match and 22 Jump Street, and he supplied the screenplay for this movie alongside Phil Lord, so he played a big part in bringing this movie to the masses. It's not very often that 3 directors, that come from completely different backgrounds, are able to make a successful movie together, but in this case, it actually worked. It's a thumbs up from me!<br/><br/>Budget: $90million
Worldwide Gross: $376million<br/><br/>Genre: Animation, Action, Adventure, Family, Sci-Fi
Cast: Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld, Mahershala Ali, Brian Tyree Henry, Lily Tomlin, Luna Lauren Velez, Zoe Kravitz, John Mulaney, Kimiko Glenn, Nicolas Cage, Kathryn Hahn, Liev Schreiber, Chris Pine, Natalie Morales, Oscar Isaac and Stan Lee. 8/10"
"ethanvdub","10","0","1","6 May 2019"," A visual masterpiece with meaningful and hilarious writing
","Into the Spider-Verse is an incredible film. From the very beginning, the animation and art direction is top notch. Spiderverse has a very unique style that I anticipate will ""inspire"" many animation studios in the future (aka, the art style will be stolen). From a writing standpoint, this film is not only hilarious, but brings with it very meaningful messages that hit home in ways many films do not. While some movies feel forced jumping between the comic and the serious, Spiderverse does so as naturally as a veteran web slinger flies through New York.<br/><br/>The humor in spiderverse picks up about halfway through the movie with the introduction of the other spider-men (and women). I never thought that Nicolas Cage would be a perfect cast in a movie, but him as Noir is masterful. His performance is filled with one liners, none of which fall flat. Spider-Ham, voiced by the incredible John Mulaney, is a childish yet funny cartoon spider-man. While at first he seems a bit out of place, the character eventually fits right into the tone of the movie. Peter B. Parker also bring a flurry of hilarious and well written jokes that lighten the tone of most scenes. While the introduction of the different characters may seem like it would break Spider-verse's carefully constructed theme, it only helps to strengthen the writing and nuances of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Verse is not only incredibly animated, but masterfully written. I would recommend this film to everyone and anyone. You don't have to like super heroes to enjoy Spider-Verse, but I would say it helps."

","Going into this I was worried that it would push an agenda at some point like many of the Disney marvel movies do, but at no point did I think that it was and it felt like a breath of fresh air. This is a movie that I really enjoyed and that I wouldn't mind watching it a couple times in a month and I can only say that for a couple other movies. The art of this movie really feels like it's coming out of a comic book, while at first it seemed a bit odd I soon began to really appreciate it and I think it just added to the show. Whilst there are a couple of cheesy parts one in particular with Aunt May, it doesn't bother me. This movie is wonderful and I just hope you can appreciate it as much as I did.👍🏼"

","This is one of the best movies Sony Pictures Animation has ever made. The pace is very fast, and multiple cameos are in the film. Most of them are so fast you may miss them! The animation is so good. It's designed to look like a comic book. It's also funny, intense, and loud! I like how the trailer hid most of the violence in it to make this movie seem better than expected!<br/><br/>In the movie, it focuses on Miles Morales instead of Spider-Man. Miles is our main character. And Wilson Fisk (also known as Kingpin) is our main villain. With a runtime of 1 hour and 56 minutes, this is the longest film produced by Sony Pictures Animation. I'm happy that this film won an Oscar, and was widely acclaimed by critics and fans.<br/><br/>This movie may not reach a billion dollars at the box office, but it's still a great movie. If you haven't watched this movie, what are you waiting for?! Go watch this movie! I'd give this movie a 10 out of 10!

","This is a really funny movie about a kid learning how to be a superhero and making life-long friends along the way. It's not dressed that way, mind you. On the surface, it seems more like a collaboration of Spidey-people attempting to stop a very imposing villain and save the day. That's the icing, the humor is the toppings, and the cake itself is the plot. Believe you me, it's a delicious cake that I didn't expect to be so well stylized.
So stylized that I kept thinking I must have missed the 3D glasses on the way in.<br/><br/>Side Note: The only reason why I'm not adding this to my Black Movies list is because it really didn't feel like a movie about Black people. It was a movie with an urban Afro-American main character that was completely honest about the fact with his taste in music and attire. Beyond that, he's just a kid, and I appreciate the way the team handled it.<br/><br/>Second Side Note: The introduction of the 5th villain was so well done visually and plot-wise that I was in awe. It was also kinda hot.
Speaking of villains, I really dug the alternate take that we were given with the supervillain designs.<br/><br/>Third Side Note: The main villain's decisions are understandable. Even the ones I fully disagree with."

"andrewsylvester","10","0","1","25 April 2019"," Easily makes it as not just one of my favorite superhero flicks, but one of my favorite films ever!
","God, where do I begin? First of all, I loved the cast. Not just with Shameik Moore as Miles Morales (Which was completely flawless), but Jake Johnson as a depressed, middle aged Peter Parker, Mahershala Ali as Aaron Davis, and Nicholas Cage as one of my all time favorite comic reliefs in all animated cinema<br/><br/>With that being said, the cast only made the story much more captivating and entertaining. With Miles starting off as a teenager who's not ready for responsibility yet, to learning his way as the new Spider-Man, I must say, it was one of the most relatable coming-of-age stories I have seen in a while despite the fact that the main premise of the film is of a team of superheroes from across the multiverse. And with Peter B. Parker, it is certainly satisfying to see Miles learn to be a superhero from someone who forgot how to be one.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>With Miles' father being as strict and stern as he is, we can easily sympathize with Miles as of why he doesn't want to be ready to take on the real world or why he turns to his Uncle Aaron about his social life or just to have a pleasant conversation at that point. And seeing Miles' Father come forth to his school with words of inspiration warmed up my heart during Miles' darkest hour.<br/><br/>One other thing I can come to appreciate is the antagonists of the film, such as Kingpin and Doctor Octopus. But I must give the filmmakers a big plus for letting the lesser known villains have the spotlight such as The Prowler or Tombstone. I enjoy seeing Kingpin's drive to finish the collider, to see his family again that he destroyed. And I must say, I was not expecting to see a female Doc Ock, so when that moment came, I was certainly surprised and satisfied. But the Prowler has to be one of my favorite characters in this movie, from his theme, the twist that he's actually Aaron Davis(A.K.A. Miles' uncle), to his moments before death that inspired Miles' to become Spider-Man and take down Kingpin<br/><br/>Overall, I truly enjoyed this film not just for the following things, but how hard the themes stuck out to me during this time. I'd give it an 11/10, but unfortunately I can't."
"malcydon","10","0","1","23 April 2019"," This is how Spider-Man IS
","Whoever made this.. he/she understood what Spider-Man is.
The concept, the aspect.. on point.<br/><br/>What a lot of Spider-Man movies lack is the soul of writting.
In this movie we could understand the will to do good, the duty, the soul, the humanity, and the fragility.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is so confident, not because of birthright and not because he is good at humour, but because he is just a simple man. He makes the act to be confident, he does like he is not afraid. He acts like a hero, not because he feels like it, but because people around him need to feel it.<br/><br/>His bravery comes from his fears and fragility. His strength is only a means to an end for a writter to get him where the villains are. So he could be where you could not get to. But when he is there? He isn't bulletproof. He isn't safe from weapons even as simple as knifes. He is just like you.
He grabs that opportunity and use it. Simply because that's the right thing to do."

Especially since the last Spiderman homecoming was really GOOD, it was so far the best spidey movie by a long shot.<br/><br/>The trailer was promising but it often is so I didn't want to put much trust into this.. but boy was I WRONG! this movie is amazing in so many ways, it's funny, it's packed with action, great design, the sound track matches perfectly, and even the odds parts of the movie (yeah spiderpig and manga version I'm looking at you) ends up being ok (they're just a tiny part of the movie anyway).<br/><br/>There are plenty of scenes that makes you laugh out loud or gasp at how pretty it is! Sure the story isn't anything special, I'd say it's not the point here, you spend time watching an art piece and enjoy it<br/><br/>I'm just hoping they'll release a second one after this, and as a side note, the post credit scene was just the best of all the Marvel movies (MCU included), so thanks Sony for finally making something worthy of the brand!"

This movie managed to take familiar characters and stories and do something extremely original with them. It's enthralling, trippy, fun, touching and very funny all at once. It's also an absolute visual treat and the voice actors are impeccably on point.

","This movie was a refreshing take on the spider-man franchise.<br/><br/>Personally I've been reading spider-man comics since I was a kid and I always loved the multiverse idea (and the mash-ups between Peter Parker and Dr. Strange), so it was nice to finally see the parallel universes being incorporated in a movie.<br/><br/>Really enjoyed the 90's hiphop- and graffiti-style artwork (since I myself grew up in that era), but that being said the tweenie soundtrack was a complete turn off and the spider-pig was somewhat farfetched and bewildering even though I get why they wanted a kid-appealing character in the movie as well.<br/><br/>Had the sound track been more loyal to the 90's theme, such as ol' school hiphop, and had they chosen other alternative spider-people instead of the pig and the anime girl, I probably would have given this movie 9 or 10. Still it was very entertaining."
"Badmoviessuck","9","0","2","19 April 2019"," All i could ask for
","Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse is really good actually one of the if not the best Spider-Man movie.
It was funny exciting and a well written movie<br/><br/>CHARACTER
I think the reasons people like this movie is cause of Miles Morales.
He is a character not ready to take the responsebility as Spider-Man and not only that he has a goal to stop the world from ending cause he made a promis to Peter Parker.
I think he couldn't control his power cause Miles wasn't ready to be Spider-Man yet cause he didn't want to accept the responsibility and i think him turning invinsible is a subtle way to show that.
And Miles uncle and how they handled him is a great way to add conflict and it further develops Miles into being the person he is.
But i wanted them to explain why he did what he did.
He is a well developed character.
Peter Parker is a meh character with decent development that don't get as focused on.
He has problems with Mary Jane so he acts all negative but being with Miles makes him slowly change and he pulls himself together and becomes a better man being able to change who he is.
The rest of the Spidey people are underdeveloped.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
The villain was actually not bad.
King pin hade a motivation and he wasn't this all bland Villain.
Even though the backstory was messy you could still understand his motives and why he is doing this.<br/><br/>VERDICT
Great Movie to watch.
But where did the radioactive Spider come from?"

"austin0731","8","0","1","19 April 2019"," Amazing Spider man story that continues Peter Parker's legacy
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a treat and a real surprise, I had little expectations going in but ended up getting a very fun and exciting animated, action Spidey adventure. This movie is also bound to excite any who were fans of Spiderman or the Spider-verse comic series released recently by Marvel comics. As a comic book fan it's always exciting and interesting to see different iterations of our favourite comic characters in comic books and this movie made it work seamlessly on the silver screen.<br/><br/>Honestly, going in I did not think that this movie would work given that the characters are not as well established as something like the MCU with rich lore and backstory that supports its grand storytelling. It kind of feels like jumping pass the origin story and straight to the final chapter, but like I said before, kudos for making it work.<br/><br/>The characters were all likeable and interesting variations of Spiderman, and I think that the reason it worked is that the movie played on the fact that the Peter Parker Spiderman story has been retold so many times over the years that they are not only self aware but uses it to their advantage. By showing us a version of Peter Parker who is older and grizzled, it breathes new life into the character's arc and brings us a much different story to what we are sued to.<br/><br/>Miles Morales' portrayal was also great, allowing the movie to explore a new character to become Spiderman and furthering the legacy of the character, overall it was a great experience that was fun, and energetic."
"Snootz","7","0","1","18 April 2019"," Incredible romp-- but just a tad over the top
","I really enjoyed this movie, not because of all the animation and special effects, but because of the character portrayals. Six Spider-people, all vastly different, even drawn / portrayed in different manner (some 3-D CGI some hand-drawn). The combination was a delight to watch and made the movie.<br/><br/>Peter Parker B was a little too stupid and goofy to be believable as Spiderman. Sure, he's been through a lot, and it's conceivable he'd be burned out. But they were just a bit too over the edge with the ""washed out Spideran"" routine.<br/><br/>On the other hand, SpiderGwen (Spider Woman? Wasn't that a different character?) was the exact opposite, and a delight. Proficient, smart, the exact opposite of the original Parker, they absolutely nailed that character.<br/><br/>Peter Porker was hilarious as expected. SpiderNoir was different and interesting. The anime SpiderGirl was VERY different and a joy to see thrown into the mix. Was enjoyable watching her working expertly at the control panel of her robot while munching down on snacks. Aunt May rocked.<br/><br/>The main character was realistic, flawed, confused, and the most human of the bunch. Very well done.<br/><br/>The reason I give this 8 stars instead of 10 is because the film would have sent an epileptic into grand mal seizures. Especially near the end of the film, the fight scene in the collider room was just excessively busy and confusing... almost to the point it became difficult to follow and unenjoyable. Turning the dial down about 5 notches might have made for a better, more plausible ending and allowed the audience to focus on what was going on rather than trying to figure out what was going on.<br/><br/>That was it's primary negative: just too busy. In any work of art, ""too busy"" is a major flaw. They needed to tone it down a bit in those final scenes. I'm sure it appealed greatly to the adrenaline junkies or young kids who have been brought up playing super-frenetic video games. For others though, that was like being force-fed a gourmet meal; too much and too fast to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Aside from that... there was some sort of quasi-red/blue 3D effect going on that wasn't really 3D effect (I tried viewing with my 3D glasses just to see. No dice.) I don't know what all that was about... but just added to the confusing nature of the animation and was totally unnecessary to the style.<br/><br/>Aside from that the movie was very well done. Good characters, good relationships between characters, stories to tell and well-told. Top of the bar when it comes to animated flicks; one of the best I've seen. If they'd have been a little less jump-the-shark at the end, would have been a near-perfect movie."

","Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse
Dir: Bob Persichetti, Peter A. Ramsy, Rodney Rothman.
Runtime: 1 hr 57 mins<br/><br/>Synopsis: Spider-Man mentors a young teenager from Brooklyn New York to become the next web slinging hero.<br/><br/>Great reviews, a lil disappointed in myself for not seeing this opening night as I usually do for superhero flicks it was well worth avoiding spoilers and seeing in the night theater screens. I've heard it multiple times from multiple people that this is the best Spider-Man film so far and I can absolutely agree with that. The story is something taken straight from a comic book story arc. Not hard to follow given they explain what the multiverse is effortlessly so the confusion is easy to overcome. Great plot twist halfway through. I suppose you could see it coming if paying close attention but if your engulfed in the storyline it's a pretty good shocker. They managed to retell the Spider-Man origin story over and over considering EVERYONE knows how Spider-Man got his powers. The animation is like nothing that's been done before and if I'm not mistaken Sony animation actually copyrighted the animation used in this film. It was like watching a comic book in real-time. How it's read the little yellow thought bubbles throughout gave me such a warm fuzzy feeling inside. Although the animation is unique and is stunning some of it can be a little hard on the eyes, lots of flashing lights, some of the scene where the background is out of focus is on purpose but it almost feels like wearing the wrong prescription glasses. The characters and costume design is so on point, the attention to detail becomes a main point in making the characters come to life. Miles' suit has always been red and black take on the classic Spider-Man costume but they gave a background as to why it's red and black which I thought was a great origin add to the film. Kingpin was probably the best idea for a villain in a film like this. Not sure if there would be a sequel yet make it drastic enough that the film can stand on its own. The late and great Stan Lee even makes a cameo which given the circumstances of the storyline at the time I could feel my eyes start to swell up. It's a 100 percent theatre watch. Just for the animation alone and soundtrack it's amazing on the big screen. Overall I can agree that this is THE best Spider-Man film yet. At least it is the most genuine to the character that is Spider-Man. What's great is that the ""Spiderverse"" is a huge factor in the Spider-Man comics and story arcs. The over all message of the Spiderverse unlike other heroes and their multiverse doppelgängers is that anyone can be Spider-Man. That's why Spider-Man's identity in the comics is so secretive. Spider-Man is an idea, anyone can wear the mask. Don't forget there is a great post credit scene after the credits.<br/><br/>""That person who helps others simply because it should or must be done, and because it is the right thing to do, is indeed without a doubt, a real superhero.""

","325. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. I'm going to label it as my favorite Spider-Man movie so far. It looked like a comic book and it felt like a comic book, Nic Cage is in it, and it also deals with one of my fave sci fi subjects multiple universes! Yep so in one of these universes, Spider-Man is battling Kingpin at a particle accelerator, ya know those things that scientists use to possibly create another big bang, or in this case open a doorway to other worlds that coincidentally have their own versions of Spider-Man, but oh yea, back to the point...Spoiler... Spidey loses his fight with Kingpin this day, and also loses his life, and the world mourns. However coincidence strikes again, the same day Spidey dies, a radioactive spider bites Miles Morales and replaces Peter Parker, harsh right?? However, due to the little crossing of the streams at the particle accelerator, a whole bunch of rad versions of the webbed vigilante is stuck here giving the new Spider-Man a very quick course in being a superhero!! A refreshing take on a story that's been done numerous times, and look forward to its inevitable inferior sequel. Filmbufftim on FB."

","Wow! Based on the trailers, I was expecting something too childish and/or convoluted for me to enjoy, but this was a polar opposite. The story was easy to follow for those paying attention, and certainly capable of maintaining the interest of viewers of all ages. The humor was spot on. The animation had an insane amount of attention to detail, but also somehow felt a little unpolished even in the scenes that didn't intentionally have the off-color effect, but I think that's more of a personal issue because I loved every other aspect of it. My only real complaint was that I didn't feel a strong emotional connection to any character at the climax, though I was certainly entertained throughout."
"cooper-knight","8","0","1","11 April 2019"," The Door's Open: A Cooper Knight original review
","The following is a stream of conjectures made by an autistic filmmaker, and is not meant to be stuffed into other readers' heads.<br/><br/>Since taking the world by storm in August 1962, Spiderman has been known to swing into many different multimedia outlets in his mission to keep humanity safe from people and creatures who know little better than to take aggression on others. What's intriguing about Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse then is how many more possibilities open in the realm of introducing different versions of the hero, like SpiderHam.<br/><br/>What works for Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse goes as follows: An African American starring in his own hero's journey raises awareness of African American equality as well as inspire the audience who can relate to Miles. The introduction of different versions of Spiderman (Spider-Man Noir, the Tex Avery inspired Peter Porker, and Gwen Stacy as Spider-Woman) gives new-comers as well as its fanbase a fresh new way of looking into different versions of the same hero. The backstory of KingPin provides the moviegoers reason to sympathize with the main villain as well has hate him.<br/><br/>What could have been improved for Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse goes as follows: more breaking of the mold of Sony's reputation for ""random = funny"" like in the scene where Peter Parker enjoys his favorite burger after it disappeared in his universe. A few more flashback sequences could help flesh out the main villain and hero, along with their families. Should the KingPin decide to take more aggression on Miles' family due to interference of KingPin's goal, then that may give Miles more reason to defeat the KingPin in mind."

Now I did like the fact that the classic Peter Parker was a wishy-washy mentor to Miles and the other spider-people were all equipped and well down that road that shaped them into that Spider-Man of their universe.<br/><br/>I didn't like how Miles became an expert web-slinger and fighter near the end of the movie just after TWO DAYS of being Spider-Man. Other than for the sake of the plot's runtime, I saw no feasible means as to how he mastered his powers in this timeframe with so little training other than trial and error.<br/><br/>Other than that, I enjoyed the movie grately.

Not the very best animation realism I've seen, but uniquely creative especially the multi-dimensional quantum effects - mind blowingly intelligent & unique. The dialogue was over-the-top intelligent, witty, comically self-effacing at times. I had to use subtitling just to keep up w/the depth of satire, banter, burlesque. The voicing actors were well selected, adding audio nuance to the characters. Then there is the multi-dimensional dessert in the form of Spider-Ham, Peni Parker, Spider-Man Noir, Aunty, Gwen.

It's not perfect - though I'm glad we're not getting the same typical origin story we always get with these kinds of superhero movies, I would have liked a little more clarification on exactly who some of the many villains of the piece are - but the animation style and energy of this film is great. We're perhaps a little too close to the other three Spiderman franchises that have been filling cinema screens over the past 15 to 20 years for this one to stand out too far from the crowd of other superhero films on the market these days, but for what it's worth in my book this easily lands within the Top 5 Superhero films I've ever seen."

","This movie is the best thing Marvel Studious has produced. I myself am a DC fan but due to the hype surrounding this movie I decided to go and watch it and you know what...I was not disappointed. This movie was filled with different and exciting versions of Spider-Man that gave the movie a different feeling. Of course the beloved Peter Parker was apart of it but after watching the film he would honestly be the least memorable of the bunch. Even though, Miles and Peter B. were really fun to watch my vote for the best character would have to go to Gwen. Phenomenal voice acting by the stars(Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld, Mahersala Ali, John Mulaney, Liev Schreiber, Chris Pine and even Nicolas Cage) which simply adds to the movie being fun to watch. After watching the movie, a few times I thought I should just post a review and let fellow folks know whats up before they decide to watch it themselves."

","I absolutely loved this movie, the story, the concept, the artwork, but the headache inducing animation style drops it to an 8 out of what should have been a 10. I'm not sure whose decision it was to make the film look as though it is streaming on a bad internet connection, but their decision making skills should have come into question long before production time ended. What played poorly in the theater plays even worse at home. Do not try rebooting your router or calling your internet service provider. That is the way the movie was made.

","In an industry so saturated with countless unoriginal, bland superhero movies, it's reassuring to find one so unique.
Spiderman: Into The Spiderverse manages to somehow feel ""new"" after decades of the same types of comic books being adapted en mass, reinvigorating the genre.
It's imaginative, creative, funny, confident, character driven & most importantly, it has heart. These days, it can feel like superhero films are continually created purely for the financial profit they inevitably bring studios - people have forgotten why we idolised these characters - so to find one made from a clear love of the source material is an unexpected gift.
Also, unlike most - the film's message harks back to what originally made superheroes such as Spiderman loved in the first place, as if someone has finally paid attention; their relatability - anyone & everyone has the ability to be super if they choose to be - all it takes is ""a leap of faith"", as the film describes. Recently, we've grown accustomed to films making their heroes so super & so mighty, they lose touch with this message - so to be reminded after so long was refreshing."

","Alternate Spider-Men from various dimensions are brought together by a selfish scheme, confusedly interact, share a few puns, trade tips and race to beat the bad guy before their respective home worlds are annihilated.<br/><br/>Given the steamroll of positive word-of-mouth, I had concerns about this one living up to my expectations. Instead, it smashed them to pieces. It surprises, delights, amuses and entertains right from the opening gun. A sharp, witty script manages to nail the goofy essence of the character (seen through a kaleidoscope of different lenses) without feeling forced, hokey or dated. It's effortlessly hip and tuned-in, a tale that understands what's fresh and spotlights that without exploiting it. The plot remains light-hearted and smooth, but not without trials or consequences.<br/><br/>And I don't think I can say nearly enough about the dynamic, electrifying visuals. They're a shot of adrenaline, consistently vibrant and dazzling, a vivid showpiece that leaps straight from page to screen without sacrificing any of the clever little quirks and format-conscious tricks that always seemed so inseparable from the printed medium. Into the Spider-Verse is the first time a big comic book adaptation has really worn those funnybook roots as a badge of honor, something to be respected and embraced, rather than an embarrassing blemish.

","At this point, we've been through multiple reboots of the spiderman franchise, so any future movies need to change the typical formula. This movie fits the bill perfectly. I didn't know anything about the spiderverse and had only seen the previous spiderman movies and 90s animated series. The movie immerses you into the comic world through lively action and cool editing. Although many people claim it's the best comic movie yet, I still think it falls short in that category, but it is an entertaining film. One of the aspects that holds it back is that the other spiderman characters from the other spiderverse are more intriguing than Miles Morales, which makes you wish it focused on them more. However this could simply be due the target demographic being teens who could relate to Miles better."
"politicidal","9","0","2","21 March 2019"," The best Spidey since the second Spider-Man film almost 15 years ago.
","This is also the best animated superhero movie since the 1st Incredibles movie which incidentally enough was also FIFTEEN years ago. It outshines the official Incredibles sequel released the exact same year.<br/><br/>INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE puts half of the live action Spider-Man movies to shame. It embraces the mythology; comments on the popularity; and even pokes a little fun at the absurdity of Marvel Comics' most popular character and one of comics' most enduring icons.<br/><br/>The dazzling animation is some of the most imaginative and spectacular looking computer imagery in years. It not only recreates the style of comics but it also pays homage to different animation styles (sometimes into the same scene!).<br/><br/>The technical achievements would be commendable if it was simply an adequate story. But INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE manages to be a gripping action-adventure and a compelling coming-of-age movie too. Honestly, this is what I hoped from the MCU's own Tom Holland led film Spider-Man: Homecoming which is a charming little movie. But it is easily overshadowed by this film's ambition.<br/><br/>The voice cast is spot on and the actors all play off each other very well. Shameik Moore is a strong fit for Miles Morales given his earlier role playing a nerd in the underrated movie DOPE. Jake Johnston is an unexpectedly good choice for a more cynical if still heroic Peter Parker than we're used to seeing. Nicolas Cage gets a lot of laughs as a B&W version of Spider-Man who talks like Bogart. Liev Schreiber delivers a gravelly and gruff performance as Kingpin while Kathryn Hahn is surprisingly menacing as familiar mad scientist Olivia Octavius.<br/><br/>The humor is often pretty funny and the action scenes are outrageously fun and exciting and creative. The animation makes full use and takes advantage of each character's distinct origin and power set better than a lot of live action superhero movies honestly these days.<br/><br/>Needlessly to say, this movie is a blast from start to finish and I think audiences will find a ton to enjoy here. Families and comic book fans would love this movie as much as I certainly did."

When I watched the trailer, I was afraid that the inclusion of Spider-Ham might be a little over the top and too slapsticky for an overall serious coming-of-age story, but everything just works beautifully.

"filmesfodasticos_by_jorgemarin","9","0","1","19 March 2019"," Spider-Verse: universes parallels to animation
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is a movie that surpasses the shallow concept of animation and launches (webs?) in a well-elaborated plot that ends up being an autonomous work, far beyond the kitsch universe of the minor heroes of Hollywood and with artistic pretensions unimaginable.<br/><br/>The story subverts what you have become used to see in movies born of comic books. To begin with, the hero, Miles Morales, is a Brooklyn boy of black-Spanish descent. At the outset, the great drama of the boy's life is the difficulty of getting in touch with the staff of his new private school, where he was taken by his father (sometimes literally by car), a tough cop who vehemently disapproves the work of the vigilante Spider-Man who (calm!) either exists and is not yet our main character.<br/><br/>The plot is elaborated within the notion of multiple universes, but these concepts do not weigh the development of the scenes, always executed with much precision and beauty. In fact, what strikes the Aranha-Verse is the force of images, which occur naturally without being attached to any specific style.<br/><br/>At no point does the movie try to convince viewers that it is not an animation itself. On the contrary, the colors explode on the screen, in psychedelia that superimposes the textures of old comics with the modern features of live action. The amazing thing is that everything is done at the same time, overlapping rough elements with a highly evolved design.<br/><br/>When the various spidermen begin to emerge, as a side effect of a particle accelerator capable of fusing multiple multiverses, the visual impact is accentuated because there is a mix of styles, including the bizarre 2D pig Spider-Ham or the Spider-Man Noir in black and white. However, the art direction is perfect, the dialogues remain consistent and, what is the great quality of the film, the good mood is contagious.<br/><br/>Even though the fight with the King of Crime is over and the conflict with his father is resolved, the new Spider-Man of this universe remains connected with parallel universes, culminating in a sensational scene in post-credits."

*****<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse"" is a satisfying movie to watch. Throughout its running time, there isn't really a time where you're bored or just want to get it over with. This said, there are some remarks.<br/><br/>The comedy in the movie seems balanced, it has its moments of seriousness, which is always well respected in any production. Some parts might have been too imaginative and inhuman (feelings-wise, not talking of Spider-Ham; Spider-Ham is awesome), but there isn't too much focus on them and were not at all excessive or inappropriate.<br/><br/>The storyline though nicely depicted with beautiful transition and chemistry between the characters, seems to have moved in fast forward in the last third of the movie. It feels like a small chunk was truncated or a part has been dissected.<br/><br/>Now as a fan the 1990s animated spider-man series, this movie gives me mixed feelings. The style of animation definitely bypasses current days outlines and is quite relatable, but I can't help but always long for the 1990s spider-man shapes that are simply animated depictions of real life.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Into the Spiderverse"" is well established, well crafted movie that no doubt gives Morales a just introduction to the big screen and gives the spider-man universe a decent gateway to our universe.<br/><br/>Well done Sony."

But it's more, the character is likable, the animation very nicely integrated (I loved the internal thoughts also appearing as comic book captions) and the pacing and characters nice. There are some things that are simply cliche, like the black family where people have to take sides either to be gang or state employees in the service of the system, but overall it was pretty nice. Doc Ock was uber cool and I think it was a real loss for missing a scene where she (yup, that how you do representation, with kickass characters!) would meet other versions of herself.<br/><br/>Overall, it was one of the best comic book films I've seen, and considering it's animated, that's saying something.

"sharky_55","8","0","1","16 March 2019"," He didn't ask for his powers, but he chose to be Spider-Man.
","I've always maintained that Spider-Man 2 is the greatest superhero movie of all time, and that starts with its Peter Parker. Early 2000s Tobey Maguire is a loser, let's face it. A scooter half-helm with a click-on strap isn't exactly a fashionable accessory, but for him it completes the look, the Amazing Spider-Man by night, a pizza delivery boy (boy, not man) by day. When he's consumed by the black symbiote in the Raimi trilogy's climax, that results in an unmentionable scene (even this iteration acknowledges this embarrassment). But isn't that just a perfect encapsulation of Maguire's Parker? He's not only the underdog, he's the furthest thing from cool. Before he was given those powers, he was Peter Parker first, and nothing can change that. The poignancy in this contrast is only heightened when he is passed down (Christ-like) through the train by the citizens he has saved, a normal New Yorker in a rubber suit.<br/><br/>That's why I've never really gotten on board with Tom Holland's Peter Parker (and the less said about Andrew Garfield, the better). He might face the same stakes as the teenage Miles Morales here, juggling great power and responsibility with English homework and the pitfalls of the high school social scene, but his faux-confidence just feels like confidence. Holland puts on the same 'I've got to save the world single-handedly' bravado as Shameik Moore, but that's belied by the fact that he's scheduled to face the world-ending threat of the Mad Titan Thanos just a few weeks after he first suits up. I can't buy his nerdy, outcast role when Holland is practically a teenage heartthrob, either.<br/><br/>We've come a long way from the awkward split-screens of Ang Lee's live action Hulk, but finally filmmakers have found a way of transferring the comic book aesthetic onto film. Spider-Verse is an electric jolt, an all-caps SPLAT amidst the conveyor belt of the MCU's codified blockbuster gloss, 3D motion amongst CGI flatness. Just watching the film is a joy in itself, as the directors lift the most eye-popping parts of the print medium onto the screen. From the squiggly lines of the Spider-sense, to the dialogue boxes that follow the action across the frame, to the way the half tone dots blend neon colours, you could pause at any moment and have the perfect wallpaper. Not that you need to; the directors speed-ramp at precisely the perfect moments to mimic the double-spread freeze-frames of the comic book, all without halting the fluidity of the action sequences. In, and then out.<br/><br/>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse comes at the right time, as the superhero film that audiences never knew we wanted, free from buckling under the strain and obligations of franchise building. Marvel captured lightning in a bottle with the witty irreverence of Pratt's Star-Lord, then proceeded to use that same brand of humour as a mouthpiece for the majority of their characters (turning one with the epithet of 'the Destroyer' into a silly punchline machine). Turns out, Holland's charm isn't nearly as endearing delivered in the face of universal doom. This tone is a little more appropriate as nervous prods in the dialogue of a transferring teenager still trying to find his place in 2nd period, let alone the world.<br/><br/>From the way the opening web-swings past the baggage of the Spider-Man franchise, deftly sidestepping the usual burdens of yet another origin story, we know we're in for a blast. The script is well aware of the audience's fatigue, riffing off our expectations through the meta commentary of a middle-aged, alternate universe Peter Parker. This jaded, washed up superhero speaks for all of us, and exposes the life that awaits these godlike figures after stardom. In that respect, he makes for the perfect partner for Miles, the pair of them foils for each other. In covering for his teenage protegee, Peter rediscovers part of his bygone heroism, which in turns inspires Morales to take up the mantle of his own neighbourhood's (or universe) Spider-Man. In a way, he is more a father figure than any of the other points of the Morales family triangle. He sacrifices his own life so a teenager doesn't have to, but leaves the option open for Miles to make that choice from himself. And when the suit fits, it fits snugly."

","It isn't perfect, but this movie is really good and just enjoyable to watch. The characters are all really likable and at times they are cliche but that never brought the movie down. The animation of course brings so much expression to the movie. Even though the plot as a whole is a little lackluster, the movie never suffers a ton from it because the plot does its job well and really supports the characters, animation, and expression. I could see a 7/10 for this but pure enjoyment of just looking at this movie and its cast brings this up so much"

"williampsamuel","9","0","1","15 March 2019"," The Ultimate Comic Book Crossover
","Over the last 16 years we've seen a lot of takes on Spider-Man, from three different actors, who were all good in their own ways. Now comes the most original and imaginative take yet, with no less than six version of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man Noire, Spider Gwen, Peter Porker the Spectacular Spider-Ham, and of course Miles Morales, Ultimate Spider Man.<br/><br/>The basic premise is that multiple versions of Spider Man from different universes meet up and unite against a common foe so that they can get home and prevent the walls of reality from crashing down. This will all make more sense if you have some familiarity with the comics, particularly Ultimate Spider Man and the recent Spider-Verse crossover. But even if you've never cracked a comic it's easy enough to follow. Which is pretty impressive given that this movie has six heroes, six major villains, and a complex plot that hinges on theories of the multiverse. Narratively this movie does a really good job of covering a lot of ground in very little time.<br/><br/>And it knows that not every character needs a lengthy origin story. In fact, the ones we do get become something of a running joke. And there are a lot of good jokes in this movie. Much like Tom Holland in Homecoming, Miles is hilariously awkward and inexperienced. His hallway encounter with Gwen is simultaneously one of the best, and most cringeworthy, meet cutes in recent years. There are plenty of jokes at the expense of Peter B Parker's visible paunch, and much is made of how (literally) black and white Spider Man Noire is. And Spider-Ham is downright hysterical.<br/><br/>The action scenes are fast paced and frantic, with the almost hallucinatory final battle being a real treat. Add in some standard but well-done family drama, some suspenseful close calls regarding the heroes' secret identities, and some genuinely surprising plot twists, and you get a well-rounded, highly entertaining picture.<br/><br/>The only real complaint I have is about the animation. For the most part it's quite good. I particularly enjoyed how Spider-Ham and some of the others are frequently animated in their original comic book style. But there are some times where the character's faces look sort of lifeless and well, weird. And in some of the faster paced action scenes, people and objects seemed to go slightly out of focus and blur around the edges. At first, I thought I'd walked into a 3D screening by mistake, but a quick scan showed that nobody else had on those funky glasses either. Maybe they were trying to go for a ""motion comic"" look, or maybe it was just the projector, but either way it was rather annoying.<br/><br/>As to whether this is the best Spider-Man movie yet, I honestly don't know. Homecoming set the bar pretty high. And it had Tony Stark. But this movie has Spider-Gwen. And a talking pig. And it's a wildly ambitious crossover that succeeds at all of its goals. It may be part of a well-worn genre, but Into the Spider-Verse has a lot more vision, wit, and originality than most movies this year. DC take note."

"wickramasinghea","10","0","1","15 March 2019"," The Best Movie Ever!!!
","The breathtaking movie Spiderman into the Spider-verse shares the idea that you can do anything, all it takes is a leap of faith. The fascinating split screen animations add a fun twist to the action packed movie. Miles Morales shows us how anyone can wear the mask and take on the responsibility of Spiderman, all you need is confidence, and, well, a near death experience. As Peter Parker says, ""Everyone knows that the best way to learn is under intense life threatening crisis."" I immediately fell in love with the animations and creative plot.
Spiderman into the Spider-verse takes you through the spectacular journey of Miles overcoming the struggles of being a regular teen, while also juggling the responsibility of saving everyone's lives alongside the other Spidermans from parallel dimensions.The main character, Miles Morales, just transferred to a private school. He hates going there but he knows that his parents won't let him go back to public school. After school, he goes to his uncle's house. According to his dad, his uncle isn't the best influence for Miles but the two of them get along with each other really well. Miles has a special connection with his uncle that he doesn't have with his dad. Late at night, Miles's uncle takes him to a secret location where they do graffiti to take his mind off of the stress of school. While they were admiring their work, Miles was bitten by a radioactive spider. He thought nothing of this until the next day, when suddenly, he kept sticking to things. He tried to convince himself that it was a normal spider, and that he was a normal kid. He didn't understand what was happening. It wasn't until he remembered a comic book that he read about Peter Parker. He realized that he was going through all of the same things that Peter was going through. Once he got bitten, you begin to see his thoughts in comic like bubbles. You get to see how Miles is reacting to every situation which takes the movie to a whole new level. The phenomenal animations were given dimension lines to exaggerate each character's facial expressions. It puts a fun twist to every other Marvel movie, in my opinion, it's what makes it better.
Saving the lives of citizens is a huge responsibility which have fallen in the hands of Miles. He asks his mentor, Peter Parker for advice,
""How am I supposed to save the whole world?"" says Miles.
""Well you can't think about saving the world, you have to think about saving one person. One thing I know for sure, don't do it like me. Do it like you."" says Peter. This teaches people that you can only be your best if you're being you, this is one of the most important messages in the movie. The thing is, Miles can't figure out how to work his powers, or what his powers even are. There's a lot of pressure being put on him. He's trying his best to figure out how to use his powers but nothing's working. Everyone's coming to the conclusion that he'll never be able to learn how to use his powers, even him. He started to stop believing in himself but deep down he was determined to save the lives of citizens, and help his friends. We've all been put in this situation at some point. Mile's shows us that you have to keep fighting. After everyone lost hope, Miles started to realize that he can use his powers whenever he really needed them, for instance, when Miles got into an argument with his dad, he had become fully invisible. Over time, he learned how to control all of his powers. This didn't come easy, he had to have a lot of confidence and persistence.
After all, as Peter Parker says, ""In the end, that's all it takes. A leap of faith."" This doesn't only apply to Spiderman, it applies to everything in life. It doesn't only show Miles story but it inspires many others to make on for themselves.
Although being Superman is incredibly difficult, keeping up with school can be very challenging. Miles is going through a lot at the moment, this meaning finding who is he is and trying to keep his grades up. He excels in all subjects at school but has a lot of self doubt. It wasn't until a teacher told him ""You're trying to quit, and I'm not going to let you,"" that he began to realize that he can handle the pressure. At the same time, it's revealed that Miles has a crush on Gwen, he can't tell if the feelings are mutual though. It's interesting to see how Miles and Gwen work with each other. I think that showing a more vulnerable side of him makes the movie more relatable. Kids and adults can understand why it's so hard for him. It almost feels like you're being put in his shoes.The humorous, yet action filled movie takes you through a rollercoaster of emotions. You begin to create an unbreakable bond with Miles instantly.
Overall, the movie captures every part of being a kid and Spiderman. It's no surprise that everyone falls in love with it. I've always hated Marvel movies but this movie gave me a whole new perspective to action. Spiderman into the spider-verse helped me discover my love for Marvel."

"vinniec-53536","10","0","1","14 March 2019"," The best Spider-Man movie!
","Amazing. Spectacular. Sensational. Superior. These words have all been used to describe the character of Spider-Man. They can all ALSO be used to describe 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse'. The film follows young Miles Morales who, after being bitten by a radioactive spider (sound familiar?), starts on his thrilling journey to becoming the new Spider-Man! Along the way he encounters several alternate, dimension-displaced versions of Spidey. These Spider-People include an older, jaded Peter Parker, Spider-Gwen, Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Ham (Yes, he's a pig), and Peni Parker (along with her biomechanical suit called SP//dr). The story is uplifting, inspiring, and hilarious, with the message that ""Anyone can wear the mask"". The animation style is unlike anything I've ever seen before. The film looks like a comic book come to life, and it was captivating and mesmerizing to watch. It really is a ""comic book movie""! I left the theater feeling like I had just witnessed something truly special. The cast and characters were all FANTASTIC, but my favorites were Spider-Ham and Spider-Gwen. The villains were all menacing and intimidating, which I feel is rare in an animated film. The music was also incredible and complimented the film PERFECTLY. In conclusion, 'Into the Spider-Verse' is an emotional story about believing in yourself and becoming who you were meant to be, regardless of any obstacles that may be in your way. It doesn't matter who you are or where you come from...you can be a hero. YOU could wear the mask. It is not only the best Spider-Man movie thus far, it's my new favorite animated film and one of the greatest comic book movie's of all-time."

","I went into this film expecting a soft, basic Spider-Man flick (as all of the other Spider-Man's have been). This, however, was not as I anticipated - well paced, humoured and well voiced, this is a triumph both artistically and cinematically. A rich cast helps boost a strong script, with sufficient backstory and dialogue to please both the casual superhero fan and the more hardcore followers.<br/><br/>The art style is also worth appreciating; hand drawn frames, taking up to a week per second of screen time, painstakingly edited to give everything a ""comic book"" feel. Even the up-to-date soundtrack perfectly accompanies the storyline when required. Without spoiling anything, this film delivers on all accounts - funny, emotional and well worth the time."

It's amazing to see how well things work in this movie. The characters are very well developed, the soundtrack is accurate, the adaptation of the story is well made and the direction is very careful.

It has definitely set the bar high, not only for animated movies but for movies in general."
"Etxpeme","7","0","2","24 February 2019"," Great cast, great story, great dialogue. Awfully distracting animation.
","The problem I found with it was the mixing of several animation styles. The faces of the characters were in 3D and had a lot of depth to them, but the shadows of their faces and their expressions were in 2D and had no depth, and looked like a transparent plastic screen with lines put on top of a TV screen. Which added a very strong, very annoying uncanny valley effect to their faces.<br/><br/>Then the low FPS in some scenes made it seem like stop animation. And lastly, the halftone comic-like effect was too distracting and looked like camera noise in some scenes, specially the shadows.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not opposed to different or experimental animation styles by any means. I have loved films like The Tale of Princess Kaguya, Le Tableau, La Tortue Rouge, Lucky and Zorba... which are all a bit out there in terms of animation.<br/><br/>But that's the thing, they combine a couple of things and come up with a new nicer thing. But in this film, they combined so many new things that it's just hard to focus on anything when at every frame you have so many new distracting elements.<br/><br/>At the end, I did end up not noticing the animation so much, because at that point I was really into the story. But at first, it was an absolute tour-de-force getting through the mismatched popourri of styles.<br/><br/>And, again, Disney/Pixar style is not the only style I'm familiar with.<br/><br/>I think if they dialed it back it would have been much nicer. Had they done the faces normal (by normal I mean of one style and stick to it, instead of mixing two very different styles that don't work well together) and a consistent cinema standard FPS. I could have dealt with the rest.<br/><br/>I still give it a 7. But it's in spite of the animation. Not because of it."

"trevorwomble","8","0","1","29 January 2019"," Better than any of the live action films
","This is a really fun film with some brilliant animation. The mixture of different styles gives it an energy that is really unusual and unique and for that I would give it nothing but the highest praise.<br/><br/>My only issue with the film was that I felt bored in a couple of places, mostly the scenes with the Kingpin. The story was fun and fairly straightforward and had humour when it was needed (including a wonderfully subtle verbal gag relating to the classic Warner Bros/Merry Melodies cartoons of the 1940s and 50s that made me laugh out loud). The film also had some terrific nods to previous Spider-Man efforts, both film and television, as well as some beautifully recreated scenes that evoke the comic books.<br/><br/>Therefore whilst I feel that this film sits uncomfortably in the Marvel canon,it should be viewed out of that context and taken on its own merits. I found it far more entertaining than any of the live action Spider-Man films and although I felt at two hours it was possibly starting to feel a little strained,it didn't feel ridiculously overlong like those live action films do and covered up what few cracks it had in its pacing quite well.<br/><br/>On the whole I found it pleasantly surprising and darned good fun."
"axelfransson-19935","9","0","2","29 January 2019"," Absolutely breathtaking and gorgeus to look at!
","Easily the best thing about this movie is the animation. It is so cartoonish and realistic at the same time that I cannot even describe how wonderful it looks. It is literally a living comic book. All the colours, the low fps rate, evrything just fits. I was not even a little bugged by any choice of the animation in this movie. But it is not just the animation that makes this movie, it is also the story and the characters. Even if this movie had a bad story and characters it would still be praised because of the animation. But it has both. They pulled of fricking SPIDER-HAM so brilliantly, it is just sick. All of the spider-characaters felt necessary and good. While some were greater than others I still laughed at least a couple of times to all of them. But easily the best two characters in this movie are Miles Morales and Peter B. Parker. This is the best portrayal of of Miles we have ever got. I know he was great in Spiderman ps4 (I have played that game over and over again) but he was never that great in the comics. He was just a black Peter Parker. But here he is a completely different character and I LOVE that. And Peter B. Parker was played brilliantly by Jake Johnson. I love that he was this sad version of our Peter Parker and he was going through midlife-crisis (it is in the trailers, it is not a spoiler). The only bad thing about the movie is one scene during the middle of the movie that were supposed to make me emotional but I just did not feel the impact that I was supposed to feel. And also this movie has that thing when the hero goes from being a beginner to becoming even better than his mentor in like three minutes. That happens in a lot of movies and it is really starting to annoy me. But except for that, I absolutely adore this movie and I would very very highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes Spider-Man. And also stay around for the post-credit scene because it is absolutely hillarious."

The visual style is astonishing, pays close homage to the comics, but still looks distinct and aesthetically pleasing. The drama here surprisingly works, and some moments in this movie are very far from being childish. Of course the Spider-Verse also has a ton of references to everything from the Raimi trilogy to the recent PS4 game, and they're also great, make sure to stay for the after-credits scene.

","Despite the Spider-Man over-saturation of the last 15 years or so, somehow this latest interpretation of the comic book is deliriously entertaining. It's interesting that the movie manages to weave the aforementioned over-saturation into its narrative, mending various alternate universe versions of the Spider-Man lore, which makes the finished product feel meta (albeit not in an obnoxious way). The voice work is terrific, with a large parade of celebrities popping up throughout the movie's two-hour running time, and the animation is deliberately, amusingly reminiscent of graphic novel stylistic conventions. Nicolas Cage and John Mulaney stand out among the parade of celebrity voice performances, but it's the dynamic between Shameik Moore's Miles Morales and Jake Johnson's Peter Parker that leaves the strongest impression."

","Great soundtrack, awesome animation and use of that comic book style, also great twists. Though its rather predictable and has some cringy moments (there's the 8/10) it's an awesome movie. You'll laugh, get sad/excited and will leave the theatre with a warm fuzz in your chest. I love this kind of movies."

Its got a lot of heart and miles morales is a great spiderman but its not excellent. Its great. A family must see. One of my must sees for 2018."
"jodieleigh-80295","8","0","2","10 January 2019"," I hate superhero movies but...
","I really enjoyed it! Bright, vibrant, well paced, good characters. I was honestly expecting to be bored but came out very surprised! I avoid hero movies at all costs, because they are usually over one, annoying, pretentious, and corny, but this one was very different. I liked the humor, and the animation really helped give it a boost in the rating. The colours are so stunning, a real treat for the eyes. For anyone unsure about whether or not to see this, I highly recommend you do, because you never know you might just end up loving it."
"cb_whitewood","9","0","1","7 January 2019"," So so good!
","I read some of these comics when they were coming out, so I was thrilled that they made it into a movie! While it didn't follow the comics exactly, it was still a wonderful and fun time, and the animation was so cool! Very like a comic book, and the characters drawn in different styles didn't clash within the movie's set style, either.<br/><br/>I left wanting a sequel and a DVD copy of this movie; Nicolas Cage voicing Spiderman Noir was a huge plus for me, too."
"theunknowncynic","Null","0","14","7 January 2019"," Underwhelming but politically correct.
","There were optimistically 3 funny moments in the whole movie. There were no moments to cheer about (and no one did), no tearful moments and no truly anxious moments. So it wasn't even a good movie to take the children to. The audience grew restless. I think some were nearly asleep so as not to notice when the movie ended. Whom ever gave this movie a rating greater than the minimum, and why, is beyond me but I don't see any ratings in IMDB greater than 1 star, which is, in my humble opinion, fair."

"kevinxirau","8","0","1","6 January 2019"," A colorful web-slinging adventure into the multiverse!
","In 1962, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created Spider-man, which became a unique phenomenon within the superhero genre. From his amazing powers to his colorful cast, he has been one of the most enduring characters in Marvel's history, but why is that? This surprise animated film, ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"", answers that with its own quirky flair.<br/><br/>Plot: Our protagonist is teenager Miles Morales, who finds himself struggling finding out what to do with his average life. Shortly after gaining powers from a radioactive spider bite, he finds his world turned upside down when he meets a disgruntled Peter Parker and several other alternate versions of the famed wall crawler. As they unite against the Kingpin and his forces to prevent the destruction of reality, he learns what it truly means to don the mask.<br/><br/>The first thing that stands out is the animation, a unique style of CGI with a 2D aesthetic. It's all really gorgeous; heck, the scenes where Spidey swings through the city alone are breathtaking and I honestly can't think of any other film that looked this. Everyone has a design that is recognizable and able to stand out from previous incarnations (the only one I'm not fond of is Green Goblin). The film pays homage to various media and even pokes fun at a couple things (really like the jab at ""Spider-Man 3""), which is all part of the hero's appeal.<br/><br/>The Spider Gang is very much like a web, each strand is distinct yet has a connection with the rest, physically and character-wise, and this becomes the basis of their kinship. They learn from each other and for Miles, it becomes exactly what he needs to fulfill his destiny. Miles himself is pretty relatable as we all have that stage in life where we are unsure of our place in the grand scheme of things. With both the animation and cast, the action scenes offer enough thrills and chills to satisfy practically any fan with multiple Spider-men and villains going at it left and right with different powers. For all the light-hearted humor and quips thrown into the mix, there are genuine stakes involved with both reality collapsing and a few characters dying in shocking ways. Kingpin in particular is an imposing figure with an unexpectedly sympathetic motivation that thematically connects with Spider-man. The rest of the villains have cool designs, but due to the already large cast, mostly serve as simple minions with the exception of Prowler who is both personal and scary.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is a fun, visually-appealing animated feature that embodies the best qualities of the friendly neighborhood superhero, paying homage and innovating at the same time. I can definitely see why audiences are buzzing over this one. Two thumbs up from me!"
"ursulapang","8","0","1","5 January 2019"," Impressive!
","It's been a while since the last cartoon movie with extraodinary art design! Very attractive visual effect! The idea of parallel universe is not unpredictable, however making it into a real movie and connecting to the old ones is really impressed. The logic and contents are not going deep, but still it's the best cartoon movie in 2018!"

","The storyline is incredible. Well thought-out and easy to follow. Animation is mind-blowing, you have to give mad props for that! Will definitely watch again. And do stay for the post-credits scene - you have to wait till the very end, but it is SO worth it."

"jellyneckr","Null","0","3","4 January 2019"," An animated movie for everyone
","Given the success of the Saturday morning ""Spider-Man"" cartoon in the 1990s and the character's ongoing popularity with kids, the fact that it took until 2018 for an animated Spider-Man feature film to get released is kind of shocking. Out of all the Marvel superheroes, Spider-Man seems like the most obvious choice for an animated film franchise. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is likely to launch that franchise, as it smartly appeals to both children who love the titular web-slinger and adults who still love the Marvel universe.<br/><br/>
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse gives fans not just one Spider-Man, but a number of them including a middle-aged Spider-Man (Jake Johnson, giving the film's greatest voice performance), a film noir Spider-Man appropriately named Spider-Man Noir (Nicolas Cage), and a pig version of Spider-Man, Spider-Ham. The inclusion of Spider-Ham is a testament to just how well the film works. Spider-Ham is a really dumb idea for a character, but one that that is perfect for both a children's picture and the sci-fi nature that 'Spider-Verse' fully embraces. What could have been an embarrassing comic relief side character instead is one of the most amusing comic book characters put onscreen in a long time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, before Spider-Ham and the other weirder characters are introduced, the film takes its sweet time getting going. For its target audience of young kids, it's odd that a movie with 'Spider-Verse' in the title takes a good half hour before the Spider-Verse is introduced. Around ten minutes could have easily been excised from the runtime without losing anything important. Once the Spider-Verse itself takes over the plot, there is plenty of enjoyment to be had, but the story kind of drags until that point.<br/><br/>
Long-time fans of Spider-Man aren't likely to find much to hate about this animated version. Visually and thematically, the films is faithful to the comics that inspired it. The action sequences are just as exciting as any of those in any of the live-action motion pictures, the story is effectively told (if a bit cliched), and it sets the stage for future installments in ways that don't feel unnecessarily forced. For viewers 12 and under, this is probably a 9/10. For adults, this is a solid 7. Recommended."

","I've been a Spider-Man fan from the age of 4 or 5 watching the spider man animated series on fox in the 90's and was not disappointed whatsoever with this movie. The animation was amazing and there was so much more continuity with comics and other spidey shows/movies than other marvel movie adaptations. Liked it so much I've seen it twice in theaters!"
"elliotbloomfield","7","0","1","31 December 2018"," ""The film was so good I didn't pick my nose""
","We took a school group to go and see this film as an end of year treat.<br/><br/>All of them loved it, there was a good story line and humour for both adults and children with some classic Spider-man jokes<br/><br/>When I asked the youngest if they enjoyed the film he said he enjoyed it so much that he didn't pick his nose... If that's not a marker for a good all round entertaining film, I don't know what it..."
"lamtimomiguel","9","0","1","30 December 2018"," The best movie of spider-man
","Not only was the animation both unique and completely tone-appropriate, but the plot and character development was also completely superb. You would think that a film about multiple Spider-people from multiple universes would get convoluted, but the movie manages to, in a very comic book fashion"
"view_and_review","8","0","1","30 December 2018"," Quirky but Good
","You know, I had my doubts about this movie. Spider-Man as a full animation. I just kept thinking, ""gonna be quirky."" Well, it was quirky at times, but it worked.<br/><br/>The fact that they toyed with the idea of multiple universes actually made the quirkiness work. The featured universe has a new Spider-Man by the name of Miles Morales. When other universes collide with his we get multiple versions of Spider-umm... beings. I can't call them Spider-Men or Women because one of them was actually a pig. I know it sounds strange and blasphemous even, but it worked.<br/><br/>The story worked really well and the animation-ness of it allowed for some freedom with the action. I wasn't mad at it because it didn't go too far off the rails. It held onto enough real Spidey drama to suspend the hardcore Spider-Man fans while diverging enough to attract those looking for something new. I liked it a whole lot more than I expected to."
"falanukki","9","0","3","28 December 2018"," The best Spider-Man of this universe
","I have been waiting for a movie like this tome come into life. Into the Spider-Verse introduces you to a very believable character chart with their own flaws and virtues. Especially the young protagonist from Brooklyn, a boy bitten by a spider, feels very real and somehow ordinary; yet fascinating.<br/><br/>Into the Spider-Verse excels in inter-textual references (memes, famous people etc) and almost over the top self-irony. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously and it's guaranteed to give you a couple of good laughs. On top of the humor the movie's visuals are nothing I've seen like ever before. The bright colors and a heartwarming message in the movie are something that I want to watch all over again.<br/><br/>Spider-Verse is one of the best animated films of this century, I kid you not. Even though the movie stumbles at its own humor and supporting characters at times, it's still a strong and coherent piece. It's a representation of Spider-Man, the Spider-Man that we all love.<br/><br/>It's the Spider-Man we should've had from the very beginning."
"kennyj-658-507525","10","0","3","28 December 2018"," The Amazing Spider-Men/Women Movie
","First off, I'd like to say that this movie isn't really a kids movie, I was surprised by the mature themes in the movie, but it was welcomed. I thought it would be a very light hearted movie but I cried, I laughed, I was in suspense and overall I had a great time watching this movie.<br/><br/>The trailers hooked me instantly with that animation style, it's frickin' fantastic! And in the movie, well it's still fantastic, nothing gets too cluttered or too much for you to comprehend.<br/><br/>But this movie is not all bells and whistles with stylized visuals, there's a great story that goes along with the animation style. Miles Morales journey to become Spider-Man is very relatable and the message (which has been around for years) is that anyone can be Spider-Man. That message hasn't really been prevalent in the movies before and it's such an important message when it comes to the Spider-Man mythos.<br/><br/>The version of Peter Parker we get to follow is an interesting one that has not been seen in any movie before, an older one that has been at it for over two decades and is kind of tired and bored with it. He's somewhat similar to Wolverine in Logan (although not as far gone per se).<br/><br/>The villains save for two are kind of bland, there maybe could have been more work done there, but as the movie's main focus is Miles, I can forgive that.<br/><br/>Excellent movie overall, go see it as soon as you can!"
"andrewestrella","Null","0","3","28 December 2018"," Miles Morales is the Spider-Man for a New Generation
","Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was an excellent film in every way. From the realistic depiction of Miles Morales (a character that I have been virtually uninterested in up until now), the really unique visuals, the phenomenal action, the amazing soundtrack, and the other versions of Spider-Man, this was such a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>I was a little thrown off with this film when I first saw the trailer because of the weird visuals, but I actually really loved how it looked. It was a comic book put to life, and that was well done.<br/><br/>The story was fantastic all the way through, and I love how the film played off the trope that origin stories are getting old and actually gives us a brand new, fresh narrative. When Kingpin shatters the dimensions, new incarnations of Spider-Man are thrown into New York with Miles, including Spider-Gwen, Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Pig, and an anime version. We even get introduced to a Peter Parker from another dimension that is a late-thirties, chubby and lazy superhero, who has pretty much given up on the whole thing. All of it is so intriguing and interesting.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like was Kingpin, because with me not knowing much about him, I found his character motivations here to be pretty lackluster to have him wanting to shatter all of these dimensions. Also, the final fight sequence didn't make sense logistically because the intertwining of the dimensions opened up a portal only within the skyscraper building, but not throughout the rest of New York? And only Kingpin and all of the Spider-Man versions were within the building, and nobody else? Where was everybody?<br/><br/>Regardless, this is definitely the best super hero film I have ever seen. It is so hip and so unique, and I loved it! With surprising amounts of emotion, fun dialogue, and an overall great story, I am looking forward to what Sony will do with future incarnations of Spider Man."
"unhappywalrusbutts","9","0","3","28 December 2018"," Imaginative, Innovative and Fun
","Into The Spider-Verse is the most creative and entertaining Spiderman film in Marvel's recent history, and is an absolute prime example of the amount of creativity that animation can bring to the big screen. While Spider-Verse is absolutely visually stunning, it also has an intense, thematic score, a strong voice cast and no shortage of clever writing and comedic wit. Spider-Verse is absolutely the best animated movie of 2018, if not one of the best in general. This is one flick that you don't want to miss.<br/><br/>My only complaint is more of a warning to viewers: There are some intense scenes that may upset young children. In addition, those with epilepsy should take caution: there are a fee scenes that feature flashing colors and lights."
"axelelwood","9","0","5","27 December 2018"," I'll rate it nine because of its potential!
","The movie was great! A movie to enjoy actually. Experiencing ""new"" villains getting furious at the protagonists is wonderful and to finally see the hype come to life was great.<br/><br/>But tbh why did they have the three characters there!?!? Peter Porker and whatever...<br/><br/>I get it, the movie is for like 7+ and whants to have humour in it but for real?<br/><br/>It ruined the whole movie. The chracters were so uninteresting, and I couldn't care more about them. If the movie writer was smart he could of just kept revealing what Gwen and Miles could do. And of course Peter Parker since he came and stuff...<br/><br/>Gotta give a shoutout to Mile's dad though, what a voice actor. The scene with him finding his brother dead, marvelous...<br/><br/>I also loved Miles Jordans xd!"

","""Finally we get to see Miles in the big screen"" was my first thought when i saw the trailer for the first time. But I have to say that the movie failed to meet my expectations although we made the leap to the spider multi - Verse. The music fed to the scenes were outstanding despite the movie flow wasn't in perfect order. But I have to give marvel for trying ."
