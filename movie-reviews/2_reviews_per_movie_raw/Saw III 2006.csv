","SAW III in my opinion is tied with the original as the best in the series. For many reasons- one reason being that it keeps it simple. Instead of dealing with multiple characters that sacrificed any kind of character development like in SAW's II, IV, and V, SAW III, like the original, has much fewer characters, leading to a more intimate setting where we can connect to everyone. And while it does have sub-plots, they don't feel out of place, they're not just randomly thrown in to shock audiences. They feel organic, they all connect smoothly at the end and make sense as to why.<br/><br/>If you've seen a SAW film, you know the story is going to have twists, turns, and violence/gore to accompany them. But at least SAW III does it very well. It expands on characterization and back stories for these characters and ties up the loose ends as believably as this franchise can do. We also get a deeper look at the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda, knowing more about how the two really look at each other. Jigsaw is the calm, cancer-stricken anti-hero who does these evil things to prove a moral standpoint. Amanda, on the other hand, doesn't seem to grasp this - instead using the traps to torture her victims as a way to get back at innocent people for the way she was tortured herself with suicidal tendencies and drug abuse. With these two extremes, we see how much Jigsaw is trying to mentor her in his vision while she struggles with her own demons. And when Jigsaw gets ill, we see that Amanda really isn't a fitting apprentice to carry on his legacy as her vindictiveness comes out.<br/><br/>SAW III is also supported by the fact that the two protagonists are developed deeply. Maybe not as much as our two anti-heros, but we understand where they're coming from. From Lynn's dour nature to devastated Jeff's situation. The subplot with Jeff by the way adds some great underlying messages to the film. These messages shows us that hate, vengeance, revenge, and complacency brings more pain than anything else, and does not solve anything. It ruins families, destroys relationships, clouds judgment, and at the end: self-destruction. Leigh Whannell, who wrote the first two films with James Waan and flew solo writing the screenplay for this one, does a nice job giving the spotlight to all the characters instead of just focusing on Jigsaw and Amanda. He makes SAW III more of a character study than any of the other installments and that's one of the essential reasons why this installment scores high.<br/><br/>Darren Lynn Bousman directs a much more subtle film than he did with SAW II and SAW IV. The quick edits are kept to a bare minimum (thank God) and the film has a lot of dread going for it. Very moody and darkly atmospheric. He focuses on the drama and emotion at hand, which was a vast improvement on SAW II and especially SAW IV. He lets the acting and the situations do the work for him instead of being extra-fancy with the camera work. Lastly, the cinematography is a plus. Darren shoots the film with a vibrant and kinetic feel and uses good, non-queasy camera movements. I love the lighting most of all though; he uses a wide arrange in the color palette (from lime green to icy blue). He definitely proves here that he knows how to grasp the material and visualize it. His direction of III ranks alongside James Waan's mindblowing direction of the original.<br/><br/>The acting is hardly an issue. It's usually good or better. Tobin Bell can play John Kramer in his sleep by now for gods sake! He shows excellent range and is always effective in the role because he gives the character more depth than what the script probably provides. Shawnee Smith is superb as Amanda, who will always be one of my favorite characters in the series. This is without a single doubt her shining moment, her most dramatic portion in the series. You really want to hate her but you just can't because you pity her. Smith could have easily played the character as an annoying nutjob, but she gives the character substance and unbelievable humanality. Angus Macfadyen as Jeff is superb in his role as well; he makes Jeff the most realistic and sympathetic character within the entire series. As far as I'm concerned, McFayden nailed the mourning father act. Bahar Soomekh was decent but always outshone by Bell, Smith, and McFayden. Her acting was a bit flimsy at times, but for the most part she gave a nice performance and made her character likable.<br/><br/>The suspense and tension, while not as impressive as the original, is still great. Hardly any other Saw film or horror film in general for that matter (with the exception of Eden Lake from last year and Inside from 2007) has been so edge-of-your-seat gripping, so exciting. The slow pacing allows you to gradually absorb everything in, and this makes it all the more better.<br/><br/>There is a lot of extreme gore in this film, but unlike some other installments like Saws IV and V, it's done very well and serves a purpose. Jeff's bloody trials are in a lot of ways cathartic. You're enduring these horrific scenes along with Jeff, and the relief at the end that the horror is over really fits with the theme of redemption through forgiveness. Moreover, the revelation that the horror isn't over, and what you feel as a result, drives home the Shakespearean tragedy in a very personal way because you the audience have to keep enduring it.<br/><br/>SAW III is clever, solidly written, has the best characters, succeeds with the emotional aspect it was going for, and ties up loose ends perfectly. For a third installment in a horror series, it's incredibly strong."
"rileymullins","8","12","14","29 October 2006"," Saw III Not A Disappointment!!
","After seeing Saw III I have to say that I was surprised. Few films do good in their third installments but Saw does quite well. It's got more gore than the other 2, not tons more, but definitely enough to please a horror/gore movie fan. Above the gore though is some of the sounds of the film that make you go, ""That was INSANE!"" There is some crazy traps in Saw III that are very good but there's always room for more sick/twisted trap ideas. It's got better acting than Saw 2, but how important is the acting anyways. Most people just want to see some nasty traps. And NASTY they are! Saw III does have some noticeable actors who are good though they aren't really that famous. Its a well made horror film. Pretty good series for 3 years in a row. Hopefully if there is a 4 it wont ruin the series, but who cares. It's like throwing out Halloween 3 and loving the rest. This one also has good twists and like the other ones I was waiting to hear that Saw theme song music and sure enough, at the end, there it was. Good Film. Well done."
"JamesCanz","7","151","234","27 October 2006"," The Incomparable Trilogy
","I would like to start by saying that I am a huge Saw fan, and came into this movie with more hype and enthusiasm than any other movie in my life. Possibly I set the bar too high, leaving it hard for this third installment to complete a legendary trilogy in the horror genre. First of all, I loved the scenario. Very similar to Saw II, Saw III had multiple ""games"" being carried on at once. Amanda kidnapping Dr. Lynn in order to keep Jigsaw alive, so that he could put Jeff through a series of vicious and gut wrenching events. Events that Jeff alone chooses the outcomes of.<br/><br/>Sequel to sequel, these movies have progressed dramatically. Two ways would be the creativity, and the gore. ""We don't pull any punches this year. We start it with a kick in the balls, and end it with a kick in the balls."" -Darren Bousman. Traps, weapons, and devices now include chains, bombs, acid, skin rippers, ice, pig guts, guns, and a very creative and sickly disturbing trap called the rack. It is similar to the previous sequel Saw II, but Saw III has even more scenes that will make you cringe or moan in disgust.<br/><br/>Unlike the subpar acting of Saw, this time around it was phenomenal. When more characters were explained, you got a good feel for the decisions they made, and why the story ended up the way it did. Tobin Bell did yet another extraordinary job with his role as Jigsaw, possibly making Jigsaw one of the most deranged and creative villains ever to step foot in a horror movie. Not only were there many fresh faces in Saw III, but some characters made a return. I wouldn't want to spoil it for you, but like Darren said, it kicks you in the balls, I would say pretty hard.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was great, but for some reason it didn't completely blow me away like Saw and Saw II did. Many stones were left unturned, which always means that there could be yet another sequel, and the ending happened too suddenly. Will there be a Saw IV? Maybe, maybe not. But for now, go see Saw III, possibly the final chapter to one of the greatest horror trilogies ever made."
"silentcheesedude","7","235","401","27 October 2006"," Still going good...
","Surprise! There is a horror series that holds up well, even on the second sequel.<br/><br/>It's difficult to explain the plot in any detail without ruining the storyline, so instead, I give you small chunks. A doctor must keep Jigsaw alive. If he dies, so does she. A grieving father must decided what he will do when confronted with the people that changed his life for the worse. Saying anything else about the story line is just criminal.<br/><br/>Like the 2 movies before it, difficult decisions and some nasty secrets become a part of a much larger plan. It manages to explain events in Saw 1 and 2 that may have been considered plot holes. It spins the whole concept of the Jigsaw character and what he represents, and the message he is trying to say. By carefully placing events from the past in a certain order, and by introducing important sequences of the character's lives, Saw 3 manages to become a pivotal point to the series. It's not perfect, though. Constant flashbacks to memories becomes a bit tiresome. Some of the dialog could be a combination of dry, repetitive, or dumb, or all of the above. And oh yes, there will be the improbable & illogical. Big critics will focus on this, and consider the movie a waste of time.<br/><br/>Of course, you can toss out the psychological-babble, tell the critics to go back to their coke snorting, and just have fun watching the movie as pure horror. Of the three, this is ultimately the most bloodiest. Those of low tolerance of gore, medical procedures and general dismemberment beware: the movie theater I went to here in Winter Springs had one movie-goer faint and fall to the floor. They had to temporarily stop the movie and take her outside, an ambulance came, and took her away. Even with this interruption, the movie kept everyone awake, wanting to see more. By the end of the movie, the audience clapped. We liked what we had seen. ""What has the world come to?"", you say? Geez. You are in the wrong place. I'm sure there will be some Disney movie to your liking.<br/><br/>The traps were clever, original, and far, far deadlier this time around. To me, it beats out any psycho with a knife/ax/chainsaw crap movie that has been pumped out too many times. It's a shame that Saw producer Gregg Hoffman passed away before this movie was produced."
"Superunknovvn","6","28","41","10 February 2007"," On par with part two, but nowhere near as good as the original
","""Saw III"" is a classic case of an ambitious sequel that has a few really nice ideas and some scenes that will make fans of the franchise very happy, but in the end it doesn't, it can't hold a candle to the original. It's a rule of the series by now that a ""Saw"" movie must include a lot of gory deaths as well as an unexpected twist at the end. While the first thing isn't so hard to come up with - and the makers definitely do a fine job thinking of the sickest, bloodiest deaths possible - it's the twist that seems more forced with each entry in the franchise. It's a disadvantage that we know for a fact a surprise is coming. What's worse is that in ""Saw III"" the final twist doesn't resolve a question we've been asking ourselves during the whole movie. No, it's question and answer in one and that doesn't make it particularly interesting. It's just a lot of explaining over some annoyingly edited flashbacks.<br/><br/>Speaking of flashbacks, there are way too many in this movie. We see things that we really never needed to see. Loose ends are tied up that aren't actually loose ends. It's like the writers read too many threads on the IMDb message boards for the previous movies and decided to spell out everything that has been ambiguous until now to put an end to all discussions once and for all. It only goes to show that those things were a lot more intriguing when they were left in the dark.<br/><br/>Jigsaw himself won't ever keep his mouth shut in this movie. The guy has thought of many cruel traps but his constant blabbering is his most sadistic device. He's already been overexposed in part 2, and this entry in the series continues to make that mistake. After the revelation about his identity at the end of the original, there really weren't too many mysteries surrounding him anymore, but part 3 still tries to come up with some (mainly about his relationship to his accomplice). Again, this is unnecessary and not very interesting information.<br/><br/>Considering how quickly the ""Saw"" movies have been made, it's a little miracle that they still turned out to be quite entertaining. However, one wonders if the franchise couldn't be better if a bit more time was spent on developing the sequels. The production values in particular could use some improvement. The make up looks fine, but the stage design makes both sequels look like an episode of ""Star Trek"".<br/><br/>So, yes, ""Saw III"" is as fast paced as its predecessors and the gruesome torture scenes don't disappoint. See it, if you're looking for mindless fun, but don't expect it to knock you off your feet the way the original did. Apparently part 4 is already in the works. Now that's just going to be a waste of time as ""Saw III"" already ends the series. Guess, Hollywood never learns. ""Halloween"" anyone?"
"TheXeroXone","3","64","104","29 October 2006"," Why Saw III failed to satisfy...
","In the first two Saw films there was something there that made the movie not just about the gore or the brutality that put it head and shoulders above all the other slasher films, there was intelligence and hope. The victims of Jigsaw were almost always given a modicum of hope that they could survive what they were given and come out breathing if they acted intelligently enough. Furthermore, the ending of each film was always brutal and yet hopeful at the same time. In the first Saw unanswered questions concerning Dr Gordon and Adam gave us hope. In the second Saw, the outcomes of the lives of Daniel, Detective Matthews, Amanda and Kerry may have been brutalized (emotionally or physically), but there was still hope.<br/><br/>Saw III was not a depiction of a lack of hope, but rather a thorough extraction of it. None of the victims in Saw III had hope or the ability to get themselves out of the traps they were in except through the actions of others. It became more about the traps than it became about the lessons these individuals had to learn. And in the end all that's left is gore, misery and an innocent life taken needlessly.<br/><br/>The plot of Saw III was Machiavellian in its design to be sure, but ultimately it proceeded through the movie like a sledgehammer instead of a jigsaw."
"skabrina","9","118","201","28 October 2006"," This movie will please hardcore Saw fans
","This movie, as always with the previous Saw installments, has once again proved to be worthwhile. The set-ups were great, the torture devices and scenes were unimaginable with NO limits whatsoever, and the ingenious traps Jigsaw puts on all of his victims were unbelievable. Saw 3 will keep you wondering what will be the outcome of the end. No doubt did this movie impress me and hopefully Saw fans as well. Now, as a warning, this movie did have some EXTREMELY sickening scenes with constant groans from audience in theater, but will nonetheless please its viewers. I highly recommend fans, and anyone who loves a good gross-out horror movie buff to see this latest Saw installment."
"shinn1","1","105","181","29 October 2006"," Wow! Did we all watch the same movie?
","Come on, people!! I'm not sure what to think about all of the rave reviews on this site for this complete waste of time & money. There were SO MANY flaws in this movie that were not only fatal, but also the minor ones kept adding up to create a general sense of disbelief about everything. This movie was a direct assault to viewers, almost like a slap in the face, as if to say: ""We know our movie doesn't make any sense, but could you open your mouth a little wider so we can cram this turd of a movie further down your throat?""<br/><br/>Granted, people going to see a horror movie aren't expecting high art, but we at least expect some semblance of professionalism on the people making the film, to make us think they actually thought about what was going to show up on the screen. Saw III is so sloppy & ridiculous that I felt I had to vindicate the other posts on this site that reamed this movie. To wit, I have made a somewhat comprehensive list of all of the things that went into this movie that made me wish I could personally rip the writer's computer off their desk & smash it to tiny bits.<br/><br/>1)If Jigsaw is so sick, how the heck was he ever able to accomplish the things he does? You'd think UPS would be suspicious of all of the items he procures...""Sir, I have your delivery of 50 mannequins & 200 voice recorders. I couldn't fit the 300 rotten pig carcasses into the van, though."" 2)The whole understudy thing with the junkie girl was particularly lame & wholly unbelievable. 3)The last line from the Dr. - ""I want a divorce."" How can the writer expect us not to feel cheated? 4)Jigsaw never would have let the end happen the way it did...he wasn't in control at all! 5)Sure, Jigsaw has all kinds of torture devices, but no Progesterone on hand? You'd think that would be pretty high on his list of things to do. 6)The whole brain operation...it was actually the only part of the movie I laughed at. 7)Pointless flashbacks that didn't lend anything to the film. Was this just filler to distract us from what a bad movie this was? 8)Tieing up loose ends. Hey, if the audience wanted closure from a horror movie series, then they would make cliff notes for them. That's not why we watch horror!! Horror movies are best when they are mysterious & we're left in the dark. 9)There are no ""what would you do?"" situations the viewer can reflect on in this movie, which is what made the other 2 good. 10)Is it just me, or does anyone else feel insulted to think Jigsaw knows all & sees all (except when it helps the plot - i.e. the junkie murdering the victims anyways...)? 11)Three words: liquefied pig juice? (...and just how did the judge not puke his lungs out until after they left that room...)?<br/><br/>Too many more to mention...please do yourself a favor and save your hard-earned money & avoid this film. Maybe it'll send a message to the producers that their audience isn't so simple-minded and they'll stop making this caliber of a movie. Then again, maybe not. Can you say ""open wide?"" There just may be another turd to shove down your throats come Halloween next year."

"Lucanus","1","76","129","2 November 2006"," Severely Disappointed
","I was a fan of the first Saw - I found the very tightly knitted mix of horror, suspense and twists, and the unpredictability of a relatively new concept really intriguing.<br/><br/>Having missed Saw II, I watched Saw III hoping that the initial formula had somehow been extended and maintained.... I was most certainly disappointed.<br/><br/>The first few ""challenges"" were nothing more than a gore-fest. The thrill and suspense of the challenges faced in the original Saw replaced with ideas designed to do nothing more than test how well you could hold onto your last meal. There was no rhyme, no reason, and paper-thin plots. Although, I do admit that the plots may have been thicker if I had seen Saw II. But any episode in a good series should be able to stand on it's own without _needing_ the prior episodes to work.<br/><br/>After enduring the first 20 minutes of blood and guts the storyline of the movie started to develop, but it was hard to actually connect with it as there was the constant fear that the next second another disembowelment or similar would jar you out of the storyline again.<br/><br/>I think that the only real review and punishment for this film would probably be to lock the director/producer/writer into a chair and give them a choice of watching the film continuously or hacking their own legs off. I think they'd lose their legs, if they have any taste."
"therealjoeh","2","49","81","6 November 2006"," Nothing more than a gorenography
","Just came back from seeing this film and I really need to stress at how crap a film it was. I had read the reviews of it being better than saw 2 and more like saw 1 (which was good!) but they were talking rubbish. This film relies purely on gore and the ability to make you cringe. The plot was stupid and too far fetched which only idiots who enjoy this brain numbing turdness would accept. I didn't even know who the lead character was...there was none I'm sure. The narrative was poor and the acting was naff.<br/><br/>I felt really uncomfortable watching this film and when i came out i was terribly uneasy. There is no resolution, it has possibly got one of the worst endings to a film ever which really p***ed me off most, i felt totally unsatisfied. Don't see this film, its pathetic."
"rchadwi@hotmail.com","3","31","49","30 October 2006"," More Of The Same - in a Bad way.
","I don't expect this review to change anyone's mind about seeing the film - if you like the ""Saw"" franchise you're going to see this movie as well - no review will stop you. But, as one who has seen every installment, I found this incredibly disappointing.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the very premise of the franchise, (damn thin to begin with), is made even more thin, while at the same time nothing new is introduced. Nothing. There is no new creative twist, just once again Jigsaw (through his protégé') getting all preachy to a new host of victims about how they had ""every advantage"" and didn't live up to (his) expectations, so now he's going to teach them something-or-other.<br/><br/>In this film in particular, Jigsaw rings rather preachy and even more so, absolutely hypocritical (for instance, Saw puts the main victim through the paces to teach said victim ""how to forgive"" - great lesson coming from a guy who blames the world for his terminal illness. Doctor, heal thyself!). Of course (not that this was different in Saw I or II) gore replaces horror, and there is absolutely no suspense. Given the story-line, I'd even call this one ""dull"" - even by comparisons to I and II. I was actually leaning my head on my hand, much of the way through - it is indeed a maddingly dull plot.<br/><br/>The film-makers definitely believe their audience is a rather stupid lot. The whole background is re-told more than once, with a liberal amount of repeat footage. Your average film-goer can make the connections in Saw III but apparently the directors thought we needed a Cliffnotes encapsulation.<br/><br/>So again, not like anyone looking forward to this movie is going to change their minds, but don't expect anything new, don't expect creativity, don't expect suspense or horror. Expect a few clever (apparently Jigsaw holds an engineering degree from Carnegie Mellon or something) torture devices and the same, re-hashed storyline, driven into the ground as well as into the audiences' heads, the dullards we are."
"mcantor12","2","24","37","2 November 2006"," Anemic screen writing
","Saw was a smash hit at the box office for a few reasons. First, James Wan is a fantastic visionary director. He manages to tell the story, build suspense, scare the crap out of the audience when necessary, but best of all (like any GOOD horror film), the viewer is strung out waiting for the next twist. The ending is so awesome, we finally get to see who Jigsaw really is, and it's the last person anyone expects (we even see John earlier in the film in a hospital bed, but NO ONE could ever have suspected...) The film wasn't even well-acted, but the STORY and the way the story unfurled was genius. Danny Glover and his search for Jigsaw, clue by clue, is what really sells everything home. By the end, we want to know who Jigsaw is worse then the men chained in the basement. When we find out the truth, it is so satisfying. That is a what a GOOD movie does.<br/><br/>Saw II brought aboard a novice director, and it becomes obvious that plot was taking a backseat to gore. Not particularly surprising for a sequel, but disappointing nonetheless. Darren Lynn Bousman tried as hard as he could to bring back the feel of Saw, but with Jigsaw having been caught so early in the film, Saw II lacks the sense of mystery and suspense that Saw brilliantly maintains from start to finish. Bousman uses the same seizure-inducing editing, but it is not as well-done, nor is the movie really scary at any point. At least the ""game"" that goes on throughout the movie is interesting, and the twist at the end is enough to satisfy the viewer.<br/><br/>Saw III is a rush job. The script was written in a week! (That should tell you everything you need to know). The traps are gory as hell but the brilliant moral lessons behind the traps are completely gone. The game that Jeff plays really only has 3 or 4 parts, and nothing comes out of any part of it. Jeff himself is never in any immediate danger, so there is no sense of urgency to the film. The brain surgery scene is totally pointless, it serves no purpose other than to gross people out, and it isn't even done well. At no point during this film was I even remotely afraid. Darren Lynn Bousman tries soooo hard to direct as crisply as James Wan did, but he ends up reusing footage over and over, and he totally fails to reproduce the feel of Saw. The editing tries to duplicate what made Saw so good, but it falls flat, and feels completely forced. There is no suspense, no climax, almost no notable parts, and there are very few surprises. The best part of the whole franchise Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is stuck in a bed, and his awesome performance definitely does not make up for this film's lack of...everything. The ending is just as anemic as the film itself. I was completely and utterly disappointed with how this film turned out. You simply cannot make a good movie if you completely disregard the need for PLOT and CHARACTERS. Darren Lynn Bousman, close, but no cig...uh wait, it wasn't even close! If this series continues, they need to bring Wan back, and they need to do a prequel so that we can see Jigsaw (the only saving grace of the Saw movies) at his finest, and not in a damn bed."

","Well, i didn't walk into this theater expecting the greatest horror movie of all time, and i wasn't shocked. I was happy though with the experience and found myself shielding my eyes, trying to keep up with what is at first a very disjointed plot, and eventually trying not to see the predictable outcomes of this film. Loved the gore, loved the traps (although they were a bit much in this version, and unfortunately there weren't many actual traps, just some excess eye candy lying about the workshops and scenes of instruments of terror.) Honestly, i saw more gruesome items of destruction in the trailer for hostel 2, but whatever. The movie was well worth my eight bucks, and i will likely rent it when it comes out to watch it again. Loved the whole trilogy, and as for this movie. i think it can't stand alone. If you liked the first two, you'll love this one, just don;t expect too much.

This movie is too predictable. There's a little twist at the end, but nothing like the surprises at the end of the first two. The whole plot deals with Amanda, but Jigsaw is the real star of the series. The fact that he is an ancillary character just ruins it for me. The final sequence is terrible and predictable.

"imelman","1","35","59","15 February 2007"," Twisted, Unrealistic and Repulsive - Pathetic
","A few things about this whole ""Saw"" series that I hate: 1. The repulsive attempt to support the belief that Jigsaw is not a murderer - in all these movies. Unfortunately some people believe in this nonsense, which is enough to convince me that in these days many people's minds are simply warped and rotten beyond understanding.<br/><br/>2. The claim of these movies that Jigsaw is just trying to help people and all the folks simply cannot make use of the great chance they were given. Yeah, it is a piece of cake to cut through your eye and look for whatever is hidden in your flesh if you have as much time as one minute. I must also admit that it is a good way to teach somebody not to sham illness and skip work by covering him in flammable substance, poisoning him, giving him a candle to look for something not really possible to find (Mark Rodriguez in ""Saw"").<br/><br/>3. I also hate the whole attempt to present the plot of this disastrous trilogy as something really realistic and possible. From what I have read, I can conclude that there are dozens of things in all the three movies that clearly show that it is all based on the audience's lack of specialist knowledge (e.g. technical or medical knowledge) and uncritical reception of what is shown. Do not understand me wrong, I do not want to slate e.g. a fantasy novel just because I do not believe in magic but because e.g. no character should be ""too"" exempt from the rules that apply to others. I can tolerate that in some movies characters do pretty impossible things but that is the convention of some genres. However, ""Saw"" tries to present Jigsaw as some genius whose work is perfect. However, if there is to be no flaw, every detail of the story should be preceded by research by the „Saw"" crew.<br/><br/>4. Especially low, primitive and disgusting is this showing every possible detail - severed limbs and the trapped people agony. Particularly shocking was the last scene of ""Saw 3"" - the disfigured corpse of Lynn. Why is it shown? Certainly for gruesome entertainment of numerous freaks because a moment before we can see Jeff turning his head from the shotgun collar blast, which clearly tells us that the trap worked. Choosing somebody's corpse without head for the last thing we see in a film is utterly devoid of any sense or aesthetic value. Moreover, it is obvious that something unshown, unknown and unexplained (unexplained but not illogical ) is much more scary and fascinating than something fully visible and plain e.g. the thing killing people in Stephen King's short story „Raft"". It proves what the purpose of ""Saw 3"" and the two other movies of the cycle is: to get as many people to the cinema as possible. I would not be so critical of these movies if they were just slashers but they pretend to be something more.<br/><br/>To conclude, this trilogy is a cheap way for some people to get a lot of cash and media attention"

","We went to the cinema yesterday to see this flick. I can't really say I had any expectations, I mean, it's a third part in a series and such are rarely keeping the same quality as their predecessors. After seeing it, I have to admit that this flick is definitely keeping the same touch of quality work as the first two parts. I'd say it's better than the second piece, and if it's not better than the first piece, then they're at least even.<br/><br/>I found the third part to have a bit more gore in it, compared to the other pieces in the series. Some scenes are really disturbing and even I, who claim myself to be quite difficult to disturb through film as a medium, at times felt really... well, it was almost a bit too much. It's far from snuff, please, don't get me wrong here, since the utter disturbance is very beautiful in a way and very artistic, I'd say.<br/><br/>For the plot, I can't pull off any complaints. Anyone familiar with the first two pieces and the plot of theirs, will recognize the atmosphere and the touch of the flick here. The acting is neat, no complaints there either. All-in-all, this is a well-made flick and among the best deliveries from Hollywood I've been confronted with in quite a while. I recommend it. 7/10."

","OK so here is my problem with Saw III. First off, we are supposed to see this Jigsaw guy as some kind of ""spiritual healer"" for people whose lives are in disarray. He takes people who have some sort of problem (note: the word problem is very loosely adapted in these films - according to jigsaw, a woman who is having marital problems needs to go through a deathtrap) and tries to help them ""heal"" themselves.<br/><br/>Makes sense?? Not really, but I will go with it anyways. In Saw III, the FINAL trap involves 4 people (including Jigsaw) but is really that crazy girl's game (even though she is Jigsaw's sidekick). OK, so Jigsaw says that he ""despises murderers."" Really Jigsaw?? Well you just included two innocent people in one of your games to teach some crazy drug-addict a lesson about anger management.<br/><br/>The one guy's ""problem"": he was upset that his son was killed in an accident.<br/><br/>His wife's ""problem"": her marriage went sour after the accident occurred and she was having an affair. Both seem pretty innocent to me. But wait, they need to learn a ""lesson."" I know it is just a movie, but the series has really lost its way from the original script. Saw 1 was not a good movie. It had horrible acting. BUT it had a decent script and a pretty good story line.<br/><br/>Now the Saw series is about the producers or screenwriters (whoever thinks up this crap) thinking up 4 or 5 deathtraps and then later filling in some lame story line. What we are left with is still horrible acting, except now an equally bad storyline.<br/><br/>Think its time to put this puppy to bed, Saw creators"

","While not being a huge horror fan I immensely enjoyed Saw 1 and 2 basically for their intelligent writing and great plot twists.<br/><br/>There is a fine line however from creating an intelligent horror flick and just writing a gore fest, this was quickly crossing that boundary and losing what was great about the previous 2 films. It used the age old solution to creating todays movies, either shock the audience or wow them with special effects.<br/><br/>If you took out all the gore from the film there would be very little of a movie left and it certainly would not warrant a release, as the story and acting alone are not enough to carry it.

","I can give ""Saw"" credit for its originality and interesting twist, though it wasn't as well done as it easily could have been. Though ""Saw 2"" was extremely silly, I can understand releasing a sequel to a movie as popular as the original. ""Saw 3,"" however, was unnecessary and unforgivable.<br/><br/>If people believed that gratuitous gore without context made for a good scare, they would watch surgery on TV when in the mood for a horror film. This was an unfrightening and hackneyed piece of garbage. The only semblance of depth I saw was that watching this movie was in itself a gruesome form of torture. I believe the script/screenplay was concocted in about 10 minutes, according to the following formula: 1. Think of a very simple twist, to be revealed 15 minutes before the end, 2. End the film by simultaneously playing familiar music and explaining exactly why one could have started the movie during the last half hour, both of which will cause the viewer to wish for a rudimentary, rusty medieval device to remove their ears and gouge out their eyes, and 3. Insert 1.5 hours of torture footage in front of it all.<br/><br/>I may only take solace in the idea that a ""Saw IV"" would be unlikely."

"IRateFilms","5","30","59","29 October 2006"," Too much gore not enough fright.
","Hellooooooo ""GORE ADDICTS"", somehow, SAW III is not gruesome or terrifying enough for me, personally. It is evident that there is a lack of the macabre and nail-biting tension that is so apparent in the opening scenes of the previous two installments of the Saw franchise. Especially with regards to the first Saw, where the budget was smaller and the gore effects were less animated. In Saw III, the gore is definitely top notch, and that is where it seems this franchise has gone astray. Relying too much on the blood and not enough on the true frightening of the audience this Saw never truly frightens, but always disgusts.<br/><br/>Beginning where the last Saw, Saw II, left off, Jigsaw is still on his deathbed, since he has been dying throughout the entire franchise. He must stay alive long enough to see his very last test subject through a series of tests and torture machines, before he can say goodbye. Unfortunately, I was never actually frightened, truly scared, like I was in the first two. I never thought to myself, what would I do in this situation, how would I deal with this. The only thing to really think about during Saw III is when are you going to turn away from the screen out of sheer disgust and not fright. Dealing with Jigsaw's underling, and her uncontrolled anger issues, towards herself and her newly acquired victims, Saw III indulges in pure torture for the sake of it. <br/><br/>Bringing a reasonable story, not as tight as the first, but still entertaining to say the least, Saw III does not leave much to be desired. One really does need to see the first two parts of the franchise, to really enjoy this one, and to enjoy the first two even more. Hopefully the Saw franchise will not go out with this as their last film, and will redeem themselves in a fourth installment."
"MarkAdler","Null","20","37","2 November 2006"," Glorified Snuff...Very Dangerous Territory
","Hollywood has been walking a very fine line recently to try to scare the crap out of us. The problem, some directors feel, is that we are so desensitized to what we have seen in recent horror films that we must up the violence, gore, and grotesque to limits never before seen in cinema.<br/><br/>With the exception of a wonderful scene in the beginning with Donnie Wahlberg, there is no artistic value to anything shown in the movie ""Saw III"" and I feel like a worse person after seeing it. There is no reason to see it unless you are a sadist, or feel the need to impress yourself for how much you can take. <br/><br/>This movie is an excersise in physical tolerance, not mental. Instead of covering your eyes in fear, you will turn away in disgust. It is nothing but a snuff movie with a budget filmed by people who used to get arrested for charging people to see it.<br/><br/>I have nothing against horror movies or gore or violence or the grotesque. I do, however, when it is done without any artistic reason whatsoever. The gore in this movie is not done to scare. What Tobe Hooper knew when he directed the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is that no matter what you show, no matter how violent you can make a film, nothing is scarier than the imagination.<br/><br/>There is a very scary scene in ""Saw III"" with a naked woman hanging from a hook by a rope tied around her hands. She is in a giant freezer and water eventually sprays at her, freezing her body. It is a brilliant, creative and horrifying method of death but the problem is the way it is shot. The movie has absolutely no problem showing this woman's naked body in the full, hanging, screaming, and being sprayed with ice water as she pleads for help.<br/><br/>What have we come to? Why must we see her privates? There is nothing artistic or erotic in this scene and it made me more afraid of what the director does behind private doors than of the main villain, ""Jigsaw."""

","Okay, if you're a Saw fan, you will be VERY disappointed with this one. It was nice to see all the missing pieces (pardon the pun) from all of Jigsaw's schemes, but the whole Amanda thing really bothered me. I found that the Saw makers really screwed up with bringing Amanda into the story. I LOVED when Donnie (Eric Matthews) commented on how she is NOTHING, which I completely agree with. She is just some whiny little girl who Jigsaw should have finished off. He gave her a chance, he tested her again (huge spoiler!!!) and I just find her character to be weak. I am not sure if it was the character or the actress, but I found it to be a really bad part of the story. Okay, it was a mind boggler to find out in part 2 that she was his accomplice. I found it ironic that she was cutting herself and doing drugs, Jigsaw chose her, she got out of the trap, gets a second chance, and screws it up big time by cutting herself and NOT listening to her mentor. Way to screw up big time Amanda. I found the end was really weak and predictable with no second guesses. People were actually booing it in the theater, myself included. If you can piece together how Jigsaw performed/set up all of his traps from the first 2 movie, that's all that Saw 3 pieces together, and also seems like it has cheap clips from E.R. hahaha! If you want to see how it ends, go ahead, but wait until it comes out on video. I hate to betray the franchise, I am a huge fan of 1 and 2, but I am just really let down by this movie. Sorry to those who are fans. Oh, one more thing: some of the flashbacks take place maybe 2 minutes after something just happened, which seems retarded."

Of course, we all know this is just a movie, and no one would ever actually DO the things shown herein. <br/><br/>Unfortunately I do not believe that, and expect to see a rash of 'copy-cat' crimes suggested by various scenes in SAW 3. There could hardly be a better example of why movie self-censorship needs to be replaced with something with more teeth. I hate asking our Government to do anything, since it does nothing well, but there must be some way of keeping filth like this off our screens. The mere fact that this is considered entertainment leads me to believe we are nearing the end of civilization as we know it. Very similar to the last days of the Roman Empire.

The gore was there, the twists were there, there was something of a plot there, but it all seemed so weak and it failed to click.

"aimless-46","3","19","38","1 November 2006"," Some Useful Information for ""Potential Viewers""
","Now that the Halloween ritual is over, so is the only good reason to see ""Saw III"" at a theatre. So here are some observations for those reading these comments while trying to decide whether they should pay good money to see the movie. <br/><br/>First off look at the situation objectively, by its third installment the ""Saw"" franchise has become what the film industry refers to as a ""pre-sold"" product. This means that during the pre-production phase it was known that virtually anything released to theatres with the title ""Saw III"" will do substantial business. For those (including myself) who enjoyed the first two, it would be a much-anticipated Halloween ritual. We would purposely not read comments or reviews (or even view trailers) to insure a completely pure viewing experience. Our tickets were essentially sold before ""Saw II"" had closed at our local mega-plex. <br/><br/>Although these economics guaranteed the production of the third installment (and apparently a fourth one), they provide no incentive for producing a film worthy of the preceding two. The original entry had to be good or suffer a ""direct to video"" fate, and the second benefited from (but was not over-whelmed by) a more professional production process because of its higher budget. In addition for the second one there was considerable incentive to prove that the first was not a lucky fluke. <br/><br/>Further red flags go up when you see that ""Saw III"" is using a ""worldwide"" saturation booking technique normally reserved for weaker blockbusters. This technique involves a lot of pre- release publicity and then opening it simultaneously in many theatres (3167 in the U.S. and thousands more worldwide). This is normally done with the goal of generating quick profits before bad reviews and word of mouth kill attendance. If a film is good it will be exhibited more discreetly because the producers are counting on positive ""buzz"" to promote attendance and reduce marketing costs. <br/><br/>Finally, the critics have overwhelmingly trashed ""Saw III"", even those who were extremely positive about the first two. <br/><br/>So as a potential (not a pre-sold viewer), you get on this site and sift through the comments to try to get a handle on the quality of the film while avoiding major spoilers; and you find an extremely divergent set of comments. My advice is to dig a little deeper into the source of the comments, click to see the comment history of each author. It is generally a good idea to give more weight to the more prolific writers-especially those whose comments about other films mirror your reactions. <br/><br/>In the case of ""Saw III"", the extremely positive (and least detailed) comments on the IMDb are almost exclusively from people for whom this is their first comment. If this seems extremely odd and if you are into conspiracy theories, you should at least consider the possibility that these are planted as part of the film's marketing campaign. <br/><br/>As for myself, I cannot imagine anyone who has not seen the first two films getting much enjoyment out to the third. Although there were times during the viewing process where I wished I was in this group because at least the confusion would have provided some degree of mental challenge during what turned out (IMHO) to be an extremely boring feature. <br/><br/>Nor would I expect anyone who did not get off on blood and gore to find this an enjoyable experience. The ""Saw"" films are in the horror sub-genre made famous by Dario Argneto and Mario Bava. This is called the ""gialli"" (yellow) style. These two Italian makers of horror/ thrillers place a huge emphasis on the deed of murder whereas other styles emphasize the solving of the murder. Inherent in this style is almost constant self- parody, necessary to expand the target audience beyond the wiggers and drones who flock to the local mall. The parody element fundamental to the first two installments is in short supply in ""Saw III"", deliberately inserted into only one scene-the pig rendering trap.<br/><br/>Checking my watch every ten minutes I kept hoping that something would happen to give an interesting tilt to what I had already seen, as had happened in the first two. But by the midway point I had abandoned this (not the checking of my watch but the expectation that any magician could pull a rabbit out of this lame hat). <br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

Did they not know what they bought a ticket for or did they come in it by accident while on Cable and have a heat attack at the first sight of blood shed?<br/><br/>By the time the third movie comes along the series has pretty much figured out what it wants to be. Jigsaw is dying and has found a protégé. The two of them set up two parallel traps. The first is for a grieving man who blames the world for the death of his young son. The second is for a doctor who is charged with keeping Jigsaw alive or her own life is forfeit.<br/><br/>What I really like about this series is that although it is bloody and gory you still do have to pay attention to what is going on and being said.

The gore scenes are far to bizarre for any human to possibly construct without being caught. where do Jigsaw and Amanda find all of these mechanisms and who supplies them with it. Without giving too much away, Jigsaw is bed-ridden with heart monitors, hospital bed, and other supplies. Where does he get all of this stuff? it's almost ridiculous. At least the first two were somewhat realistic in just making him sick or in a wheelchair, but this has transformed his ""Home"" into a hospital. This is just one of many flaws i can point out. The killing scenes go above and beyond what is necessary for anything to be rated R. I've seen things far more gory than this, but all of them have bared the NC-17 rating. i found myself cringing and looking away at several points. i could never enjoy this movie because i was so worried about shielding my eyes from the ridiculous gore. The ending just doesn't do it...it makes sense, but it does not fit. It seems as if the directors ran out of ideas and threw this in there.

Those who will see it, will realize that they've written the story into a corner and a 4th film will be extremely contrived--as if these films aren't already. The film gets a 3 because the imagery is pretty good. Although, shooting the whole film in muted tones takes away from changes in mood. Then again, this is a one-trick pony.

Also a vomit bag was provided with instructions on it about the gut wrenching scenes in the movie.<br/><br/>With this background let me go straight into the story line. I found the movie totally absurd. Its only focus seemed to be showing different technique of how to kill people in the most disgusting ways. One after another it kept on showing it. The actors and actresses were amateurs and did not act well. The photography was as expected it would be  with more hand held camera  as if someone / or something is following the character which is being shown. The lighting throughout the movie was poor  as if fear can only be projected through dark images. There was irritating sound track added throughout the movie  that did not fit the scene. There were references and cuts to several shots  that seem difficult to understand for those who are seeing Saw series for the first time. I suppose they were from the previous movies. The directors managed to gather enough audiences to see the movie through their franchise and marketing skills.<br/><br/>The movie was bad in all aspects of movie making. More disgusting than what was shown in the movie was when a few die-hard fans of Saw series stood up at the end of the movie and clapped appreciating the movie. What the world has come to be to appreciate? A total waste of time!"

","First off I want to state I am a fan of the first Saw. I thought the uniqueness of the story and suspense was noteworthy. While there was gore, the great story was the focus and the gore wasn't overdone and used for mere shock value. The movie kept you drawn in and on the edge of your seat all the way to the very end wondering what was really going on. In Saw 2, it was all downhill from there. The audience knew who the killer was or the mastermind of the crimes, and the ending was not a smart twist which leads to the very messy Saw 3. I mean messy in more ways than one. The first major problem is a lot more gore instead of great story. The new characters presented in this installment are not ones you particularly root for like you do in the first and even second film. The second major problem is the Amanda character. The motivation behind her helping Jigsaw is completely illogical. In this movie, her character is now revealed to have a murderous streak which makes absolutely no sense. Then of course there is the very unsatisfying ending which I won't reveal other than stating is full of additional plot holes."

","Ah yes, Halloween. And for the past 3 years running, we have been as some would say ""blessed"" with the Saw franchise.<br/><br/>The first one was compelling, simple, and smart, making it what could be said to be one of the best horror films out there.<br/><br/>So in 2005, Saw 2 rolls along, and I'm expecting another Saw, perhaps even better. I admit, I did enjoy 2 rather than other cheesy horror films out there such as The Grudge, but I expected Saw one. Maybe it was the change in direction, actors, different story...<br/><br/>So in 2006, the third installment to the series comes along, and I'm already hearing rumors about how it was the best one in the series and terrific. It was good, but still not the original Saw that I cherish in my heart.<br/><br/>The traps, oh they were good. Maybe even the best ones out of the whole series. If you don't like blood, gore, and breaking of bones I suggest you skip this one.<br/><br/>The story...similar to the 2nd's level of intensity. It could be said that Jigsaw wanted to go out with a ""Bang!"", like they said in the 2nd one. So he decides, as his final test before his death, to test human's and their ability to forgive one another (which is what he did in parts of the first 2, but he really takes it to a new level here).<br/><br/>The whole series represented a test on human nature, mainly the ability, or inability in Saw's case, to forgive. The writer Leigh created a fantastic series and I look forward to more from him, but they just need the acting. Tobin Bell was amazing, yet all the other characters seemed too corny or whiny, in an annoying sense.<br/><br/>There was a nice twist at the end, better than the one that was in 2. It'll have you thinking about it for a while, like I have been for the past 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Final Opinion: Better than Saw? - No. Better than Saw 2? - Yes. Go see Saw 3 for your movie pick of this weekend, and prepare to be disappointed or amazed. Its your choice."

","I saw this, the third entry in the now annual Saw franchise, last night, at a midnight showing with a rowdy crowd no less, and despite the fun atmosphere, the entire experience was rather ""blah."" That's the only word I could come up with to describe this film... Admittingly, I was never really a fan of the SAW films... I found the first one's climactic pseudo-clever twist to be irritating, and the second film simply LOOKED awful. Nothing is new the third time around... the story line is more convoluted than usual, and by the end we're waiting for the ""twist"" so when it finally comes it has virtually no impact. Visually, the film is repellent to look at... it's damp, dark, purposefully ugly and oppressive, and while some may laud the film's ability to sicken, I find little to applaud in filmmakers who choose to color their palette with various shades of vomit green, murky browns, and cold rusty steel. The film's soundtrack is also rather off-putting, making this the most audibly irritating film since Nekromantik's off-key violin scrapings.<br/><br/>Violence-wise, I suppose the film delivers, as we are treated to various mutilations, torture methods, and power-tool brain surgeries, all to the giddy delight of the audience who cheer, gag, and dry-heave in unison... I can't really explain the satisfaction of witnessing violent and disgusting acts with a large crowd, and I myself let out a few audible groans and, yes, a few cheers, but in the end I'm left wondering what's the point. The film is a really depressing experience, perhaps more-so than the second one, and the highlights are its sadistic torture set-pieces, which the filmmakers ludicrously attempt to justify with lame attempts at poetic justice.<br/><br/>It's ultimately this ridiculous sense of self-importance that make the Saw films fail. Yes, Troma films also attempt to shock and gross-out their audiences, but they don't take themselves nearly as seriously as these films do."

With a strong background in survival horror, thrillers, and slasher movies, I was even shocked at the amount of gore in this film. So any other horror-head will appreciate this too. Like any trilogy in the past,this movie did an excellent job of returning back to its roots. In true ""Saw fashion"", there is a twist. One which will be somewhat similar to the other two, but will have a distinct difference. In the end it seems that James Van and Leigh Whannell have made their mark on the horror industry.

","Watching Saw 3 is like a recap of the first 2. Saw 1 & 2 were good but unfortunately the third isn't there are far too many scenes of the first 2 which are not very useful. I don't like the Saw trilogy because of the blood, gore or violence it's because of the twist in the end. The twist was terrific in Part 1 & 2 but not in Saw 3. The only two scenes I liked are:<br/><br/>Where Detective Kerry had this rib cage trap & Jigsaw's brain operation.<br/><br/>While I was watching it in the scene where Detective Eric pounded his foot and snapped it off made the whole audience jump from their seats in the cinema. My girlfriend was holding my denim jacket so tight in the scene where Troy was pulling out the chains in his body that the buttons broke. The scene where the guy was getting drowned in the pig carcass was so stupid, basically Jigsaw ordered about a 1000 dead pigs to kill one man so he can die happy. The film came up No 1 in the Top 10 UK box office in its second week and I read in the news that a 22-year-old man & a 36-year-old woman fainted in the cinemas and they were taken to hospital. Definitely not for the faint hearted! The forth instalment is due to the end of October 2007 we will see how that goes. The second is the best out of all 3 of them then the first & third in last place. Saw 3 was made with a budget of $12 million & grossed $30 million in its first week and almost $151 million worldwide."

","I liked the original Saw. It was suspenseful and it was inventive and the ending was done in good taste. Saw III is not a good movie mainly because of Jigsaw and his accomplice. Visually it is disgusting and it made me cringe several times because of the gore and I suppose the makeup artists did a good job. But the plot and the lines that jigsaw says ruin the film. His character is extremely flawed. Nothing actually explains his insanity, something about a car crash or something, boo hoo. The actor did not do a good job and the actress who portrays his accomplice is equally obnoxious. The original saw portrayed Jigsaw as a silent killer, which worked. From Saw II until this one they have him as an actual character which I believe was a mistake. He's boring and fails miserably at attempting to play a psychopath. Doesn't even come close to Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs or even Kevin Spacey in Seven. Please don't make anymore of these movies. And if more are made please do not give jigsaw any lines because no matter what he says there is no explanation through words for his insanity."
"mafleury2928","3","6","10","29 October 2006"," Worst of all three
","I would like to mention that I love both Saw 1 and 2 but Saw 3 was the typical cliché horror movie. Way to much gore, little plot, too much noise over the dialogue, and a predictable twist. The main focus was on the gore and not on the plot throughout the entire movie. It grossed you out more then it made you think about the philosophy that was presented in the other Saw movies. In Saw II, the plot was complex and they didn't need unnecessary nudity or gore to make it a ""good"" horror movie, much unlike Saw III. The plot in Saw III only focused on the vengeance of one man and Amanda screwing up again. That's all. The ending was the most disappointing part for me. It was no where near as good as the twist in the 1st and 2nd movies and the whole thing was predictable. Only see this movie if all you care about is graphic gore scenes and a movie that doesn't make you think in the least. Sorry to all the Saw fans but don't waste time and money seeing Saw III."
"jp_51004","7","9","17","29 October 2006"," Let the Games Begin
","Lately Dr. Lynn Denoln (Bahar Soomekh) has been going through some marital problems and the anxiety is beginning to affect her work. Late one night after finishing her shift at the hospital she is kidnapped and taken to an abandoned warehouse. Shortly after waking up, she soon meets the notorious Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). He is currently dying slowly as the minutes pass and Amanda (Shawnne Smith), Jigsaw's sidekick, tells Lynn she has been kidnapped in order to keep him alive. Alive long enough for someone else that's also been kidnapped named Jeff (Angus MacFadyen), to complete his very own game. While telling Lynn this, Amanda places a collar around Lynn's neck that is connected to Jigsaw's heart rate. If his heart rate drops below zero before Jeff completes his game, the shotgun shells on the collar will all simultaneously go off at the same time. Amanda then preps Lynn as Jigsaw explains, ""its a test of will. Its a test to see just how willing you are to keep someone alive"". Lynn realizes she has no choice, and so the game begins. Jeff must now navigate through a series of tasks where he is promised his chance to get revenge on the man responsible for his son's death. Something he has wanted every day for the last three years. Both Lynn and Jeff are now each tangled in a horrid game of survival. What they don't know is their games are merely stepping stones to the true reason they are involved with Jigsaw's latest puzzle.<br/><br/>First off, I have to admit I was a little turned off to 'Saw III' earlier this week after months of having much anticipation, when I heard it was guaranteed that there would be a 'Saw 4' if 'III' did well opening weekend. I feared then, and still do slightly, that the 'Saw' franchise will become what 'Friday the 13th' did: a series of films where only the first few were considered good. Once I was sitting in my seat at the theater though, and the film began I was vastly interested far more than I imagined I would be. This 'Saw' has so much story in it than the previous two had, and really more than most horror films today do. Much of it is told generally with various flashbacks. Even by following the story closely, the final twist probably won't be known to you until its unveiling. Its in the twist that a tiny smidgen of a problem exists.<br/><br/>Its obvious that the twist was meant to shock the audience in a big way. Maybe it does catch most people by surprise, but for me didn't. Not that it isn't good, it just didn't come across the way it should have. It gave me a, oh...okay feeling rather than a, holy sh*t reaction. This minor flaw doesn't hinder the film's poise at all though. It still remains interesting to the very last minute.<br/><br/>The only real letdown in the film are some of the traps. In all there is a total of six physical ones. These devices of torture and terror are what many of people who love the 'Saw' series look forward to most. Out of the six, only two were what I'd say good. Yes, all of them can kill, but four of them seemed boring and livid. I'm not sure what happened here. Although, this doesn't destroy the movie, in a small way it does take away from it. Even so, the two good traps almost make up for the others.<br/><br/>So basically, 'Saw III' is somewhat better than I expected. It borders very closely to the feel of the first, which is a definite plus. Most satisfying though is that it wasn't the least bit dismal. Never was there a dull moment, even with the few shoddy traps. Now that 'Saw III' is done and over with though, it only makes me question what '4' have in store for us. Yes, Tobin Bell was contracted for five films permitting each is considered a success, but now that director Bousman and writer Whannell have decided to step aside and leave the series alone, I can only wonder two things. Will 'Saw' become a victim of its own game? Just how long can the series go on before it suffers the fate Jason Voorhees did?"

"jonnathan-coleman05","1","13","27","29 October 2006"," Jigsaw @ it again
","The only reason this movie gets one star is because that's the smallest value IMDb allows to give. The reality is that this movie is about a negative 2 or 3 on a scale of 1 to 10, and isn't close to as good as the first one. The plot outline of the movie is simple. On Halloween day in 2004 Saw was released to the world. It made so much damn money that the producers, directors, and writers at Lionsgate just had to make a Saw II. Saw II came out on the surprising day of Halloween 2005, and guess what? they made a sh*tload of money again. So that leaves us with Halloween 2006 and the release of Saw III. Saw III will rake in another $100 million and undoubtedly pave the way for Saw IV. This is definitely the new generation of horror movies. And just like the old generation (Jason, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street), Saw will sadly have 50 million sequels and gladly make $50 billion. The first Saw was great, and definitely is considered one of the best horror movies to recently be released. With that being said, the sequels will get no better than the original, but will continue to be released every Halloween for the next five to ten years. It's a good movie to see on Halloween, and I guess some people may be be awed by the gore, but the MPAA will only allow so much, so don't get your hopes up. The number one goal of this movie is MAKING MONEY, nothing less, nothing more. Saw had a moral at the end of the story; ""Don't take life for granted."" The morals of the Saw II and III are ""With the right marketing and advertising, you can make millions of dollars off of garbage material."" If one positive thing is to be said about this movie it's that the marketing and advertising team involved are FU*&ING GENIUSES."

","This is one of many horror movies made by the producers similar to James Bond movie production, loaded with gadgets and full with goof that makes the movie funny rather than horror filled. Most of the film is shot in complete darkness to provide the sensation of horror. Producer forget that he wrongly use the line ""It is amazing to know how much pain a human body can take?"", he doesn't understand the true meaning and limit of pain. e.g. there is one shot with black guy nailed to the cross having his body parts twisted till it is broken one by one before twisting his neck. Human body can only take a certain level of pain and the brain would shut the systems off to prevent damage to brain cell. If this tormenting machine would work, the black guy should have fainted when his arm is twisted to the extend of his bone braking. Actually twisting can only remove bone from its ligament. There is too much inconsistency. Guess this movie has no intention to reflect what will really happen scientifically."

","A whimpering middle-aged man pulls against the chain around his leg that keeps him tied to the wall. Using his shoe, he desperately struggles to reach a torch inches out of his reach to shed some light on his situation. He reels it in, and we find ourselves looking at the remains of previous instalments of this horror trilogy; the hacksaw, a dead body, and of course, a severed ankle. Our whimpering middle-aged man looks at the ankle, at his chains, at his own ankle, and then his eyes rest upon the saw and I remember thinking ""No. Not again. Not again."" Not again indeed. He spies a concrete slab on the ground. After a period of consideration (which is clearly not long enough), he proceeds to crush his ankle, before twisting it out of the manacle with his bare hands. And to think I was relieved.<br/><br/>Saw III throws you in the deep end. After a few more woefully graphic set-pieces (including a rather nasty ribcage removing machine), it calms down a bit to reveal a plot. Amanda (Shawnee Smith) kidnaps a nurse (Bahar Soomekh) in an attempt to prolong Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) life, while simultaneously putting vengeful father Jeff (Angus Macfayden) through a series of grim trials, and while these plot lines are fairly detailed, you're given the impression that the plot and the actors only exist as an excuse for the writers to show the grotesque scenes that characterise the Saw trilogy.<br/><br/>These moments crop up very often and are done very effectively. The quick cuts and close-ups reduce the audience to hiding behind their hands or wincing in a state of perpetual nervous discomfort, but they are thankfully well spaced out, allowing you some recovery time in between the film's more painful moments.<br/><br/>However, they're more shocking than scary, and that's where this film falls flat. While the first film had the ability to shock and surprise you, the third appears to have given up on scares and just focuses on the repulsive. While Saw III is certainly good at what it does, in light of its predecessors what it does doesn't seem to be enough."

The movie borrows many aspects that were used recently (and were good) by other movies; just take a look at how the movie ends, with ""surprise!

","Most people who go to see Saw III will already know what they are letting themselves in for. A continuous helping of stylised gore, violence and torture where the only tongue in check will be one that is literally chained there in a macabre and psychotic trip that needs no justification other than an audience demand for video-nasty type scenes with the slightest pretence of psychological storyline to justify prolonged physical and mental cruelty that makes the Nazis look uninventive.<br/><br/>The moral dilemmas seem pretentious in the extreme - a lovely doctor is forced to save a monster's life or be killed herself. A man bereaved of his son in a car accident has to 'forgive' all those vaguely involved to win his own redemption.<br/><br/>As standard fare, Saw III delivers - no more and no less than Saw II (or The Hills Have Eyes or The Devil's Rejects and so on). Deranged serial killer, Jigsaw, devises complex games for his victims, often involving self-mutilation. Clues are left on cassette recorders, and the captives follow instructions to try and win a reprieve. Saw III reprises some of the themes and loose ends from the previous two movies, but stands up equally well on its own. Sadly, after so many films of this ilk have been made (particularly ones with the sophistication of say Hostel or Audition), Saw III loses much of its shock value and is little more than a late night gore-fest to wind up the series. The overuse of loud and jangling sound effects from the very beginning is distracting and unnecessarily sensationalist and I found myself weary within the first three minutes. You might want to concentrate hard as several lives are being tortured at once and separately, but all is joined up at the end by the bedridden mastermind (and if you were half asleep or drunk, he goes over the 'answer' more than once, slowly). This flesh ripping feast should not be attempted on a full stomach. Anyone tired of happy-slapping will doubtless get inspiration."
"J_holden_Hume","1","10","21","27 October 2006"," Truly Awful
","The Midnight screening of Saw III was only about half full, an oddity for a 12:01 unveiling of a new movie at one of LA's most popular theater. Actually, there were more film-goers there than I had invasion, and I was shocked that there were still as many people remaining when the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Saw III is a much too long, much too ridiculous, much to gory, and not at all frightening piece of B-Movie-with-money trash. If Saw was clever and mildly gory, Saw II was contrived and very gory, than Saw III is bland and ultra gory. The gore in the first one shocked as well as served a satisfying purpose; here it just mortifies for the sake of mortification. The two-hour movie would have been thirty minutes if all flashbacks were eliminated, I found myself thinking this film should come with a warning label that says, ""This film contains 25% new material."" Its amazing the amount of places that the audience is told Amanda (Shawnee Smith) back-story and what she has done to ""aid"" Jigsaw in the past. The audience is given no credit for; or incentive to, watch the first two movies. Everything is spelled out in gory red detailed flashbacks. Folks if you want to sit through the first two films again, and you don't want to pay $15.00 to do it, I suggest you close your eyes and remember the parts of the first two films that stick most in your mind. Piece them together like a montage, and play it on a continuous loop. If you do that for 2 hours you would have just watched saw III."

","Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) is an anguished man, who grieves and misses his young son that was killed by a driver in a car accident.

The morbid, claustrophobic and gore story unravels maybe the sicker game of John, with surprising tests, twists and revelations. This movie keeps the atmosphere of ""Seven"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and Tobin Bell has another great performance in the role of and intelligent, sadistic and cold blood killer. The camera and the cinematography contribute with the morbid atmosphere of this film. The fans of this character will certainly enjoy the conclusion of the trilogy, but it certainly is not recommended for audiences with problem with psychological and visual violence.

","Just saw this in the cinemas today, while its the most grotesque in the trilogy, it can also crown itself as the worst. It reminded me more of a 2 hour music video rather than intelligent storytelling. It also had the worst acting as well whereas the first movie had some semi known actors and the 2nd had some actors from sitcoms/series, this has none of the above. Jigsaw reminds me more of a low budget Christopher Walken, and the main characters like the female doctor and Jeff doesn't create some kind of attachment or compassion for the viewer. If u have seen Tobe Hoopers ""Texas Chainsaw.."" classic, and remember it had a blonde female character that screams a lot in approximately 30 minutes somewhere in the movie, then just imagine seeing that in a 2 hour cocktail like Saw 3. Thats what u get, people that keeps screaming, cameras that switch around nearly every second and a story flow that never captivates you. The first movie was a blast and the 2nd was at least enjoyable, but the 3rd is a blend of frustration and loud noises. It certainly destroyed my view on the Saw series as a whole."

","8/10<br/><br/>OK before you ask I'm not making this up i have seen saw 3 (went to the cinemas last night ended up watching Texas chainsaw massacre the beginning which was OK very predictable and basically everything i expected just more gory) anyway through some contacts i got invited to watch saw 3 some of the staff were watching it late night.<br/><br/>Hmmmmm OK its hard to comment on the film much because i really want to tell you the main spoilers but would get shot.......all I'm saying is half the people on the saw3 board are making spoilers up from what I've just read.<br/><br/>This film reminded me more of saw 1 than of saw 2. I think in saw 2 jigsaw was taking the p*ss and having fun with his plan this one jigsaw goes back to actually being like he was in saw 1. Yes the film does answer most of the questions people want to know about the entire series and at time is flashbacks before the original saw.<br/><br/>The traps seem to unrealistic unlike saw 1 where the traps were accepted as being able to pull off. Putting people in big mechanical traps considering jigsaw is basically near his death in this film seemed very far-fetched but this is another long awaited saw film so who cares.<br/><br/>The gore was more violent in this film and i think at times was not needed because the original saw was implied horror you didn't actually see much apart from a few quick shots of blood.<br/><br/>There are quite a few twists in this film and i recommend watching saw 1 and 2 before seeing this one just so you fully understand certain characters relationships to the past character. Basically this is still a class film and the twist although is very good didn't seem as shocking as the previous two films but was well written and remains a strong trilogy.<br/><br/>OK not Leigh or James writing the next film then there should NOT be saw 4.......this film just about pushed the franchise too far but was really great to see jigsaw back in action but didn't seem as original as the past 2 films. Anyway its hard to rank the films in order i need to watch this at home again when on DVD. But the original saw was the best even though i loved saw 2 it was a great follow up. I was a little bit disappointed to be honest at the way SAW 3 ended but it could of been a lot worse i suppose but still a great film which i was expecting way to much from."

I went to the theater with low expectations because the newspaper reviewed it and they said it was a really really bad movie but when I came out I finally understood why they gave it so bad review. The main reason may be that they haven't seen the two first movies. Trust me, if you are going to see Saw III you have to watch the previous two Saw-movies, no exceptions. If you go watch Saw III without you've seen any else movies you are a completely idiot, you won't understand anything of it, I promise, nothing if you haven't seen any Saw-movies.<br/><br/>As for those who already seen Saw and Saw II, go see this!

","I thought that this movie was the most gross and frankly has the most disturbing torture scenes around. It crosses the line between acceptable and something that you would find on the black market showing real torture scenes.<br/><br/>It has a totally confusing, complicated plot that twists and turns like the bones it breaks in the movie, leaving the watcher scratching his head with ""What just happened?"" The torture scenes were disturbing to say the least, but I wondered through the whole movie how the killer could have such precision timing even though he was on his death bed. I think in this case, less could have been more."
"Lawrencer-2","5","7","14","27 October 2006"," Why Saw 3 just didn't CUT IT!
","Saw 3 is an average horror/slasher flick which had an intriguing social commentary regarding change in the individual. This combined with a killer who technically does not kill anyone led to this fresh take on horror and what made the Saw franchise successful.<br/><br/>However, the 2 problems I have with the culmination of this series were 1) The incomplete connections with the previous two films and 2) Focusing entirely on the plight of the killers, leaving the victims as afterthoughts which the second half of Saw 2 was all about.<br/><br/>First the connections: I liked the extra exposition regarding Jigsaw and Amanda's allegiance, but ultimately found it to be extended redundancy of what we learned in Saw 2. What would have been more thorough would have been the inclusion of Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) and Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes) in the flashbacks. James Wan, for some reason, finds it necessary to reveal to us the true fate (death) of Adam (Leigh Whannell) but NOT Dr. Gordon?<br/><br/>In fact, none of the major players from the first Saw have any impact on the rest of the story outside of Jigsaw and Amanda who, of course, play bit parts at first. Simply revisiting that disgusting bathroom/dungeon doesn't do enough to acknowledge the events of the first film and this leaves a sour taste in my mouth because I still feel that Saw 1 was superior. I truly hope the reason for this was incompetence, because deleting these characters entirely due to budget issues would be even sadder. . . because we all know how pricey Cary and Danny are, especially when it results in an extra 5 minutes to the final product.<br/><br/>Which leads me to my second criticism, focusing on the villains. Saw 1 set out a clear and interesting formula. A killer imposes his sense of morality on society and forces the unworthy to change or die via trial by fire; some live, most die. This forced the audience to think twice about what makes a criminal, a villain, a good citizen, a good person. And this change is only experienced twice in the trilogy, the 2 survivors: Dr. Gordon and Amanda. By the end of Saw 3, Dr. Gordon is moot and Amanda is exposed as a weak fan-girl of Jigsaw's who talked a good party line, but whose actions regarding the execution of Jiggy's ""games"" were the opposite.<br/><br/>THERE WASN'T ENOUGH DEPTH FOR JIGSAW AND AMANDA! And this simply cannot be if the story is really about the villains. Jigsaw and Amanda have no arc. They are the same, aside from Jiggy's declining health. His experimental torture ""games"" are exposed as complete failures when Amanda fails the final game and we are left with the one truth we knew before Saw was ever conceived: people won't change for anyone unless THEY are the ones who want the change; coercion has unreliable outcomes, even if it's a matter of life and death -> case in point: the perpetual violence in the Middle East due to its inscription in the history and social conscience of its people.<br/><br/>Guess what that means? Saw really wasn't this fresh new idea, it was your basic gore/slasher in disguise due to serious holes in plot. Two things would have solved this and allowed the story to make more sense: 1) We need Dr. Gordon and 2) We need more WHY from Amanda and Jigsaw. James Wan could always write Saw 2.5 to fill in the gaps, but then I'd rather get front row seats at the local slaughterhouse to satisfy my blood lust. At least that would be real."
"mbraniff","1","11","25","30 October 2006"," terrible!!!!
","So basically if all you want to see is bone splitting, blood and guts please go see this movie. I should have known from the previews of movies such as Hostile II that this was going to be a bad experience. <br/><br/>I thought the ending was terribly predictable, Jigsaw's ""test"" itself was obvious, the immediate death of certain main characters... all useless. This movie is more proof that as a trilogy goes on it just gets worse. The only reason these movies are still being made is because people (like me) continue to pay good to see them.<br/><br/>For all of you who love these terrible excuses for cinema, no worries the movie perfectly sets up Saw IV."
"jed-estes","8","5","9","29 October 2006"," Fine but not great like the first one
","Let me first off start by saying that I thought this was a good movie and decent but as a conclusion to the series it sucks. I love the film and its exploration of Jigsaw and Amanda's characters and their relationships, but I found the supporting cast in this one to be something different from the other two and that difference is that they were boring and that I did not really care for them. All the other side characters in the trilogy had something about them that made you care. In this one they were just second rate. I liked the fact that Adam and Eric returned and I also thought the revelation that Amanda killed Adam was a better twist than the manufactured one that was given at the end. They should have saved that tid bit for the final frames. I am very sad that all the characters are all dead now or at least supposedly. I still want final conformation on Eric and Gordon but there is always Saw four waiting in the wings. Although I hear it will be a prequel which would be cool. Hope to see everyone there."
"gregsrants","6","5","9","28 October 2006"," Not as good as Saw, but it does have its moments
","It was about an hour after the screening of Saw II when myself and two friends were sitting around a small bar table drinking already a ridiculous amount of alcohol when I asked the question. ""What was the last third installment of a horror movie that was any good?"" No sooner did the question flow off my intoxicated tongue when the music in the bar stopped playing, all patrons and workers froze in their tracks and crickets could be heard from the field across the road. My friends sat there stunned like a Gibson in squad car headlights.<br/><br/>So we started rambling off films each one met with uproarious laughter or headshaking acknowledgement. The Exorcist III, Friday the 13th (in 3-D no less), Jaws III, Poltergeist III, Halloween III. No, no, no, no, no. Oh the hours that have been wasted watching such trash (although, we all admitted that if any of these flicks showed up on our telly late at night, we would probably sit transfixed through the end credits).<br/><br/>Granted, not all was bad. Nightmare on Elm Street : Dream Warriors was alright. Alien III was also given a passing grade. But in all, we agreed how hard it is to maintain the same levels of fright, awe and excitement three times over.<br/><br/>That brings me to Saw III, the latest installment of the very popular franchise that follows the infamous Jigsaw killer as he puts his prey through some of the most elaborate killing challenges ever put on screen.<br/><br/>Saw III starts where the last Saw left off (note therefore that it is of great value that you have seen the first two films if you want to be able to follow the bouncing ball). Without giving too much away, there is a darkened bathroom, a police detective chained to the wall and a saw. Think you know what's coming? You're wrong.<br/><br/>The opening sequence of Saw III sets the tone for the rest of the film. It is gory. It is loud. It is graphic and it will make you wonder if you would have the same passion to do whatever it takes to release yourself from your shackles.<br/><br/>Barely able to take a breath from the opening, we are on an express train of squirm. As we watch through squinted eyes, a man is tortured with flesh piercing chains (take that Hellraiser) and a woman gets a breast reduction with a contraption so elaborate, Einstein himself wouldn't have been able to make it if you spotted him the supplies and blueprints.<br/><br/>It was after this flesh ripping horror that I finally got a chance to dip into my popcorn vat for some air. While I sucked the salt and butter off the popped kernels, we get reintroduced to the Jigsaw killer (once again played by Tobin Bell). We are reminded of the frailness of his physical state and the reliance he started in Saw II with Amanda (Shawnee Smith). Jigsaw is dying, and there is an hour of film run time left.<br/><br/>The movie then shifts gears and follows two separate story lines. One has the father of son who was killed when hit by a car being given the Jigsaw opportunity to save himself or exact vengeance upon those involved with his sons death and the trial for the accused driver.<br/><br/>The second story line follows a doctor named Lynn (Bahar Soomekh) who has been kidnapped by Amanda and outfitted with a contraption that if Jigsaw's heart was to stop, her head with also cease to remain on her shoulders. The movie then shutters back and forth between the two unlucky participants in the Jigsaw game of terror leading to an ending that will bring all parties together and will seriously (SPOILER ALERT!) affect how Saw IV might evolve.<br/><br/>Saw III did something that the first two only hinted at. It brings the blood and violence level to new highs. Where Saw and Saw II had more implied guts and gore, Saw III goes for the jugular. Throats are slit, people are ripped to shreds and actors are shot and covered in pig entrails. Joy oh joy oh joy! By the time we get to an unlucky man who is literally twist to death, we have seen enough bones and blood that I wondered how the movie escaped the dreaded NC-17 rating.<br/><br/>Horror films should be enjoyed without expectations, so as I normally do in my horror reviews, I will leave most of the details of the plot and death to be experienced by the paying customer.<br/><br/>But what I can report is that for those of you who have been disappointed time and time again by the rehashed installments of horror franchises, Saw III sits on the side of Nightmare on Elm Street : Dream Warriors and Scream III. It is a worthy approach to continuing the story of our favorite characters while providing us with all the red soaked gunk that we pay to see every Halloween.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"
"slevin_baddog","4","5","9","28 October 2006"," They should be ashamed
","Let me preface this by saying that i am HUGE saw fan. I did a philosophy paper on the morals of saw. The Film makers of saw three should be ashamed. This was not the same concept that the saw movies tried to make. This was as much a Saw film as Batman and Robin was a true Batman movie. When you see saw one, there is little gore and violence. Its all about psychology and philosophy and mystery. Its a masterpiece in that it doesn't make you wince at the action, it makes you ponder. The storyline is phenomenal and the whole dialog taking place is genius. When you see saw 2, the acting has improved. There is a little more gore, but the movie still isn't driven by it as much as the movie is about the dialog and philosophy. When Matthews and Jigsaw are discussing the will to survive and the cure to cancer, that is genius in that is gives the audience something to ponder. There are a couple of ""wince scenes"" but with good reason. Saw 3 breaks the tradition. Yes, there is still some dialog, but it gets lost in the movie between the scenes of gore that drive saw 3. It isn't about philosophy, its about the inventiveness of the traps, and that makes this movie nothing more than a really creative slasher film. Most of the violence was unnecessary and overly graphic (not a saw trademark by any means) and the movie makes you sick more than it makes you ponder. Even the twist, which is suppose to be Saws trademark and specialty is predictable and doesn't shock you as much as make you feel stupid. This movie excels as a ""gross you out"" film and fails as a true Saw film. Mix that in with constant seizure-worthy strobes going off (a couple people in the theater had seizures from all the strobbing) and this movie is packaged for 15 year old goth in every family. But thats not a what saw was about. I know Saw. Saw is a personal friend of mine. And THIS FILM, ladies and gentlemen, is NO SAW. Don't waste your time hoping for another Saw. This movie is intellectually devoid on every level and is only good for mind-numbing violence."
"kevin_crighton","7","5","9","28 October 2006"," a fitting end... possible spoilers
","With both Saw and Saw II having had plots that twisted and turned (almost like Jigsaw's mind!), I wasn't sure where a third movie would go. I have to say, however, that Saw III easily matches up to the first 2, and brings to an end a very impressive storyline (I hope, more on this later).<br/><br/>The first few minutes tie up some loose threads from Saw II, while at the same time laying some groundwork for the story. As before people are being put into traps designed by Jigsaw, with a possible way out, if they are willing to do what is necessary.<br/><br/>This time, the focus is mainly on 2 characters. A grieving father, angry and devastated by his son's death, and the lack of punishment of the person involved. He's giving a chance to work through his pain via a series of traps inflicted on those most to blame for his pain, mainly the driver (his son was run over), an eyewitness who didn't stop, and the judge. He's giving the chance to save them, and in turn, perhaps save himself.<br/><br/>The other person is a doctor, who is abducted and must keep Jigsaw alive, while the game is being played. If he dies, then she does...<br/><br/>The movie also delves into the relationship between Jigsaw, and Amanda. Both in relation to the current game, and those of the past...<br/><br/>To say anymore on the plot, would give too much away, suffice to say it twists and turns like the others, features some brutal deaths, and gives one last nasty twist, which some people hope might result in a Saw 4.<br/><br/>I for one, think that the ending here, cruel as it is,should be the ending of the story. The Saw movies have surprised me both with the plots and level of violence, but I don't think you can take the story anywhere else. And considering it covers some 'plot holes' left over from Saw I & II, I get the impression the makers feel the same.<br/><br/>If there is a Saw 4, I'll go and may enjoy it. I hope though it ends with this fitting conclusion."

The only reason I was on the edge of my seat for this film was because I was inches away from getting up and walking out of the room. The plot is lackluster, and while the last 3-5 minutes has some major twists (duh) I can't believe I spent almost an hour and 45 minutes watching this movie. The acting was....lets just say if you can scream and look pathetic...you got hired for this film. The demeanor of the characters as well as the dialogue was absolutely unrealistic, boring, and almost mind numbing. I found myself more upset with the characters than almost anything. None of them developed well, I didn't care what happened to them, and in the end, I was relieved to just see the final credits.<br/><br/>If you have $3 dollars, don't rent this movie...Use it to buy paper, a pen, an envelope, and a stamp so you can write to the people who thought this film was a good idea and tell them thanks for nothing."

The whole Jigsaw concept reminds me of a really bad episode of The Crotch Chronicles. I felt dizzy.<br/><br/>Also, was anybody in that theater buying this cockamamie plot about the dude kidnapping the doctor? What's that all about? Or the part where he maims that guy?

","Excuse the pun, but this third ""Saw"" entry sews up some loose ends left behind by the previous installments. Once again, the insane Jigsaw plays a series of macabre games in which various abductees end up killed in an ingenious fashion. Here, one man's limbs gets twisted until they bleed and break, and another man, a judge, is immersed in ground-up pig guts. The whole shebang is terribly overproduced and zapped of potential suspense by the fact that we always cut between the victimizer and his victim. It all felt like wallpaper to me after a while. I just wanted it to end. The production values are high, the sound mix is deafening, and the film's photographic facade is green and grim. But it's monotonous. The nasty dialog is creative while the dialog in which humans are meant to interact realistically is weak. I hate to say it, but endless torture and bloodshed is boring."

The problem with Saw III is the fact that once you get past the violence, it's a boring film with next to no originality. The characters are worthless, so why care when they die? The ""atmosphere"" is non-existent, unless you count dim lighting as atmosphere. There is nothing frightening about the movie, no interesting plot, no character development or empathy. This leaves two things violence, and boredom, and to be honest, violence with nothing to make it interesting is boring in of itself, which means this movie really has one element: Boredom."

However, Saw III is nowhere related to its parent dollar-maker.

","I suppose that, on a technical level at least, this is a competent movie. It just doesn't seem as if the Saw series is going anywhere. The motivation in S1 was a bit novel and interesting. In S2, it got to be pedantic and overextended. In S3, it just seems pointless. OK, OK...we're ultimately teaching people how to care and be compassionate. I get it. The slight variations and twists that S3 holds for us are not enough for us to generate any genuine concern. Even the ""surprise"" deaths at the end are just not of any real interest.<br/><br/>Shawnee Smith is over the top and Mcfadyen (almost unrecognizable in this role) is pretty ham-fisted as a protagonist. Tobin Bell is, well, Tobin Bell...same as always.<br/><br/>About the only difference in shading in this movie is that many of the deaths are not only bloody, but ultimately devoid of meaning or hope. I couldn't help but think about Final Destination 2. In FD2, the characters figure out that Death is coming for them, but in _reverse_ order from how they were originally supposed to die. In S3, the motivations of the primary killer are, unlike in the S1, actually based on a need for violence and vengeance. It's an attempt at a cinematic flea flicker play...and it doesn't come off."

The first was very good but you needed to look past some points were it could be better. Every movie has flaws... and for a fairly low budget it was very well pulled off!!<br/><br/>For me, it's mostly the way the story takes one place ( most of the time, those places are horror, murder scene , related ) , but has a totally different meaning towards the end. And it produces these feeling in all the 3 films. <br/><br/>But you never get the feeling that it's the same, you're just wondering throughout the film... Who is JIGSAW testing and how is he doing it ??<br/><br/>conclusion :<br/><br/>A MUST for thriller/horror/scary movie fans...but one warning, it's not for the weak hearted... you have been warned ;-)<br/><br/>It surpasses the two previous saw movies in every way... even if you think halfway that you don't understand what he's doing, wait till the end !!!

I consider myself an intellectual, and good storytelling is key in most movies, but come on...The reason I watch the Saw movies is for the inventive, sadistic killings! :) Even the killings in Saw III didn't seem as great. No way out? Come on, that's what makes them so great, that there is a chance the victim will live, but I digress... (I loved ""the rack"", though!)

It was very weak and it seemed to be thrown together to put this movie out on the market.<br/><br/>The special effects for this movie was up to standard and the gore and shock value was there as well. It looked to me like that was what they were most interested in were the ""traps"". They wanted to try make new ""traps"" and go on the whole (shock and awe) treatment.<br/><br/>Again this movie is not what I thought it would be. To me the whole movie just falls flat on it face.

If gore scares you, then this movie could put you into a state of shock. It is one of the goriest movies that I have ever seen. Unfortunately, gore alone cannot make a movie great. Saw III lacked the originality that the first had and the plot could be guessed by anyone who had seen the first two.

","First, the flashbacks were a waste (as many have commented).<br/><br/>The ""logic"" and ""twist"" do not even make sense this time.<br/><br/>Jigsaw is testing Amanda? Already done that! At the end, Jigsaw says to Jeff, ""I am the one responsible for the death of your son...and I have your daughter."" So wait a minute. This time, Jigsaw MADE Jeff become a vengeful man unable to forgive the killer of his son? I thought Jigsaw was supposed to kidnap/torture people who were wasting their lives. Now he PROVOKES people into becoming the types of people he doesn't want them to be? And: what's up with the murder of the female cop at the beginning of this one? We barely got to know her, and her murder had NO connection to the main ""test"" of the film (that of Jeff). The first three gory scenes in the movie make it look like this will be about the investigation of the missing detective from Saw II...then that part just drops out of the film.<br/><br/>Saw I and Saw II were totally contained movies...the ""twists"" at the end may not have made perfect sense, but at least the killings themselves were confined within a coherent frame.<br/><br/>This movie has NO coherence, in short. A good torture/horror film cannot JUST be gory, because when the gore doesn't mean anything, it loses its effect (this is why Seven is an effective/disturbing film, for instance).<br/><br/>Best parts of this movie: brain surgery, doctor getting her head blown off, guy on the twist torture machine Next Saw: Amanda isn't actually dead, wakes up"
"gzamikes","5","4","8","30 October 2006"," Weakest One So Far
","While there are more traps in this movie than the others and the fact that they're more gruesome can only carry the movie so far. This one is missing what the other two had in terms of pacing and it really shows.<br/><br/>While Jigsaw is being operated on, there's someone else trying to make their way through various tests. When we're watching the new person, the film grabs your attention. When that's not happening, the movie loses a lot of steam very quickly because there's not much to watch during the operation. In fact, there's so much pacing that's lost that there are numerous cuts back to the other films to fill in various parts of the story in an attempt to keep it up. I'm guessing they just used extended footage from filming before because they're all built around scenes from the previous two movies. In addition, there are lots of quick cuts. Sometimes that makes it harder to understand what's happening including one scene where a mysterious woman is in the park which is then never explained in any sense. I know the quick cuts are a staple of the Saw franchise but they went overboard here.<br/><br/>This one also isn't really scary. More often than not, it shows things with incredible graphic detail which might make you turn your head away more than they'd make you scream.<br/><br/>Great writing fuses the two parts together beyond the ending you'll probably see coming and does manage to tie everything up so the typical cop-out ending for other modern horror films doesn't apply here which has always been a strong point for the Saw series. Then there are WAY too many quick cuts to sum up everything that has happened in case you weren't paying attention to most of the movie.<br/><br/>In the end I can't recommend it as highly as the other two films."

","Okay, the first was reasonable and looked impressive but was not exactly worth a sequel never mind a second sequel. Saw 3 is quite simply awful. A poor script badly performed is hidden by flashy CSI style editing and horror-style aesthetics in a lacklustre story about inhuman characters whom no-one in their right mind should care for. Parts of this film aspire to become almost as notorious in extreme cinema as the fire extinguisher scene early on in 'Irreversible'. It is horrifically gratuitous and misguided and the alleged plot twist is so obvious from an early stage that I felt later on like I should have walked out from the auditorium in disgust. It will merely appeal to the Friday night gore-hounds, whereas the first at least tried to be intelligent, despite ultimately being crass and morally dubious. So go and see this film if you want to feel violated by the end credits and for the rest of the evening"

","The fact that we live in a world where Amy Winehouse is dead but Darren Lynn Bousman lives angers me in ways I can't describe. She only released two albums, and both of them are perfect. Bousman has had multiple opportunities to direct a good saw movie, and can't even put out a 4/10. If he were put into a weird, completely subjective saw trap where he has to direct a SAW movie that's good or else he drowns in money he doesn't deserve, he'd be dead by now. SAW III tells the story of Jeff, who's son died a while back and now he has to go through a trap because he wasn't dealing with his grief in a way that pleased Jigsaw. Jeff has to choose to wither save or kill people who had to do with his son's death. He chooses to save all of them, but two of them die anyway because the audience needs to see blood. While this is happening, there's also a bunch of stuff happening with Jigsaw and his cancer or whatever. This movie is not good, and it never will be. Watch it if you're a fan of the franchise."

","While some people are calling this gore flick the best of the three, I would have to say the opposite. Saw III has neither the plotted suspense of it's original nor the fast paced bloodletting of the amped up predecessor- yet the film plays like a half-assed amalgam of both. I can imagine hardcore fans of the morbid franchise or people who have never seen a Saw deriving the most pleasure out of this latest mechanized entry. Fans will eat up any bone these practical jokers (screenwriters) throw whilst trying to provide some sort of deadly scenario, usually giving way to an inordinate number of flashbacks, all in the name of allowing the franchise's sole saving grace (The blissfully creepy Tobin Bell) opportunity to chew the little scenery his tired ass can. Likewise, those who have never indulged in the current heavyweight champ of box office masochism may find a squeamishly fun time, guided by endless twists and brutally unique gore. For all those that fall into that third group which have seen these previous entries and are not die-hard fans (and over 20) will probably have a hard time swallowing this rushed, misdirected cash in on the silly little craze that was once unique, graphic, and entertaining but now merely feels monotonous, cheap, and exploitive. Desperately trying to weave an ambitious narrative to help explain some of this sorry excuse for a trilogy, the movie instead comes across as a convoluted hodge-podge of throw away ideas, weakly connecting the over-the-top and less frightening set piece death traps, with all the personality and character development of a soap opera."
"fantasiafanny","7","2","3","26 November 2006"," Not exactly the best of the three, in my opinion...
","I wouldn't really say that this movie is scary, although it does have some chilling moments. I would say that it was mostly suspenseful. Also, most of the devices(or traps) came off as sickening and disgusting. They aren't really terror-striking like the ones in Saw and especially Saw 2. They were too intense and lacked the horror quality. There's a fine line between being scary and being gross, and I thought this movie, overall, was just suspenseful and gross.(Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this is a bad film!)<br/><br/>*SPOILER WARNING*<br/><br/>One more thing I would like to add, is that the story wasn't that well written as the stories of the previous Saw Movies. That was probably the main thing that disappointed me in seeing that movie. <br/><br/>1.) This movie may also come off as confusing to some viewers who have not seen the previous ""Saw"" movies before. I would highly recommend seeing the first and second Saw movies before seeing the third, because this movie contains flashbacks that tie the first two into this movie. 2.) I do not like the fact that just about every main character in this movie dies, and leaves me hard to believe that there will be another Saw Movie. The plot should carry on and on, carrying us into the next film(it is rumored that there are supposed to be six Saw movies), but for some reason, this movie put it to a halt. Unless the next movie is a prequel or a midquel, the ending of this movie was NOT a good one. 3.) Normally, each Saw movie has a big twist that is not supposed to be known by other saw fans/viewers. Sure, the twist in this movie was unpredictable, but it wasn't as great as the other twists.<br/><br/>Overall, not a bad movie to add to the series, but it did not live up to the previous Saw's expectations."
"DICK STEEL","7","2","3","25 November 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Saw III
","Jigsaw's back! But this time the modus operandi is slightly different. In what was a game of pain, life and death, this time round it seems that there's an overconfidence that the unfortunate prey will not get out alive. Hence the death traps being literal.<br/><br/>But of course those who have not watched Saw II, will not know the suggestion at the change in MO. In order not to spoil it for you, I shall not mention a word, but hey, even without watching Saw II, there're ample flashback scenes, and newly created ones, to bring you up to speed. But trust me, watching the second film first before this, will help bucket loads, as it picks up directly where the previous film left off, with the return of characters played by Dina Meyer and Donnie Wahlberg.<br/><br/>Like the previous movies of the franchise, you have those elaborate devices for those sick games that Jigsaw likes to play with seemingly innocent men and women, chosen for not valuing their lives, and wasting it away. Through such games, Jigsaw's warped aim is, for those who survive, to learn to appreciate life itself. Then again, just how many do survive, since to do so calls for sacrifice, often pain inducing in a massive way in a race against time.<br/><br/>However, while the litres of blood continue to flow, the devices and plans here tended to be below par. Sure they're sick, but this time it really stretches it a little. Things happen to fall in place, and well, they just do. There seemed to be a bit of borrowing from Hannibal, with the use of boars (although dead ones here) and not since that film had I seen the power drill put to good use, with that unforgettable sound of the spinning drill. That skanky toilet makes a comeback too, and it probably ranks up there with toilets from Trainspotting and Crazy Stone.<br/><br/>You can guess the direction of the film's narrative, predicting where it will head, and how, but what you probably can't guess right, is the rationale behind what's happening, the Why, until the answers are revealed at the end. It'll also put to rest some of doubts and queries left hanging at the end of Saw II, and in a certain sense, Saw III wraps up the trilogy. Unless of course there is talk about making another film on the now cult figure Jigsaw, which will have the franchise follow the footsteps of the in-thing to do nowadays - the prequels.<br/><br/>While there are new characters introduced, it's kind strange that we do not care much about them, except to silently bet if they would be able to survive their ordeal. Perhaps gore movies are such, that an audience doesn't care what happens to them so long as blood is shed and bones are broken. Perhaps the influx of gore movies, each one trying to outdo the other, makes us just baying for blood to be shed by the characters, and nothing else.<br/><br/>So for those who have already watched the first two, this one will bring everything to full circle. And I can't get that all too familiar tune, which is played each time Jigsaw reveals his intentions, out of my head."

"phatjamesbond","3","2","3","11 November 2006"," The movie, with the actual play out minus all the hype.
","This was a rather disappointing movie. People say that when movies come out with sequels and trilogies, they are usually not as impressive. Though many movies have exceptions, this movie unfortunately fits the stereotype.<br/><br/>Without citing any examples or spoilers, I must say that the characters in this movie did not seem real enough to connect with the audience. While it would leave me at certain times thinking ""That's what I would do,"" other times the characters seemed a little fake.<br/><br/>The first ""saw"" movie was rather okay, being thought provoking and making you breathe just a little faster during the movie. The second one was rather unimpressive, but worth watching just for the sake of going ""I watched 'Saw 2,'"" However, I believe that this does not come close to taking the cake of the three. I unraveled the plot in a matter of about 10 or so minutes into the movie, and I was unfortunately proved right at the end. People may dispute the intense violence and gore of the ""Saw"" trilogy to be a thing needed in all the movies, but there will be moments when even the most stomach strong gore enthusiasts may begin to think they are a little unnecessary.<br/><br/>Is this movie worth watching if you've never even seen the first two? No. There are people that can pick up on the storyline of a sequel, even if they haven't seen the first one. However, this one is just way too ""out there."" It will be a senseless slasher (its not a slasher film, but there are moments of slashing), gory, torture, mind breaking inducement hour and however minutes it is long.<br/><br/>Should you watch this movie if you liked the fist two? I guess so, but I would say not to expect too much from it. As an individual movie, if not trying to milk the first two, this movie is not one to be enjoyed. It appears that the hype created from the first two ""Saw"" movies were overestimated, and this is probably the least impressive of the trilogy."
"fubar7331","3","2","3","9 November 2006"," gory filler
","I left this movie absolutely disappointed. Saw i delivered suspense, horror, character development, and an amazing story with a great twist. Saw 3 has none of those things. The only thing carried over is the grungy, dark backgrounds and scenes of intense pain and gore. The storyline is lacking at best. The flashback scenes, which were probably the most interesting parts of the movie, seemed like they were leftovers of Saw I. There was some character development and good performances, but the characters themselves seem offbeat and illogical. Jigsaw now puts people in his traps for absolutely bizarre and nonsensical reasons.<br/><br/>Most of the movie was simply filler with no real substance to it. The overdone - and i mean overdone - torture scenes are boring at best. If this movie was shorter, perhaps, it could have kept the audience entertained. However, the lengthy boredom stopped the movie from amping up any tension, and the signature twist expected from every saw movie was weak at best.<br/><br/>Die-hard fans of saw I should steer clear of Saw 3. this movie is simply an example of greedy producers milking the cash cow dry. casual moviegoers that just want to know what happened might somewhat enjoy it, but this is not the kind of movie that casual moviegoers would go to anyway.. Don't see this movie. Rent saw I and watch it at home instead"

"jzappa","7","2","3","5 November 2006"," No Comparison To The First Two
","What a way to ostensibly finish off your franchise. This franchise has been the group of the most ideal horror films, at least for me. Once I got through Saw, it shot straight up to the top of my list of best horror movies. Despite what snobs may say about it, it has everything the perfect horror movie should have. It has a scary, claustrophobic atmosphere, characters that aren't stupid teens going camping, eery abstract music, constantly different killings, and never a happy enough moment. It really had an effect on me, an effect that really shuddered me, because I'm not used to being truly scared by a horror movie the way I'm supposed to be. Only a handful of other horror films have scared me substantially. Saw II, though it didn't scare me as much, still maintained a creepy if not claustrophobic atmosphere and effected me with gore the way very few other films have. Saw II has a great understanding of the sensitivity of body parts like eyes and veins and knows how to get the audience's goat by exploiting them. Saw III is lackluster in both the scariness of the original and the gore disturbance of the second one.<br/><br/>Saw III was said to be gorier than the first two films put together, and what it really is is lacking in the amount of gore of either of them individually. Yes, it has some gritty scenes and plenty of blood and body parts, but it's far from consistent and never is it as terribly creative or shocking like it is with its predecessors. Its atmosphere is not very creepy, either. The way the first film was claustrophobic in that it put us directly in the characters' bone- chilling situation, this film is claustrophobic in that it's missing something by not expanding further. We keep feeling like there's supposed to be more to the story, more to the action, more to the violence and the horror, but there isn't.<br/><br/>This third installment in an otherwise brilliantly frightening series of movies insults the audience's intelligence in the execution of its twists, it ends too quickly to be affecting, and its plot itself seems forced. A part of the story that I like involves its main victim, a grieving man whose son was killed who is pitted in games wherein he has to battle himself and control his vengeful thoughts. I also like seeing behind the scenes of the first film, the showcasing of the first film's backstory, even if knowing everything now that we didn't know when watching it---even if it's a severance for the most chilling parts of its story---detracts from the fright. It may not be as scary anymore with the footnotes Saw III provides."
"tonymurphylee","Null","2","3","2 November 2006"," Despite Some Deep Flaws, this Film is generally solid, although fans might be heavily split(no pun intended).
","** out of ****<br/><br/>I went to see this one opening day on the 26th or whatever, and i have to say that i got pretty much what i was expecting. Gore. Now don't get me wrong. I was pretty much positive that this film wasn't gonna scare me, despite high theatrics, good plot, and a generally dark tone. Well, it had all that, but the main attraction here is the violence.<br/><br/>The plot consists of a low level nurse being forced to try to keep Jigsaw alive for as long as another man can pass tests in some other rooms in the area whilst Jigsaw is dying of cancer. In case you haven't seen the first two films, i'll fill you in. The Jigsaw killer's hook is that he never really kills anybody but rather gets people to kill them out of their own foolishness. This film has a nasty, awkward, weird vibe to start with in the first few minutes when people are stuck in traps that are pretty much impossible to survive no matter how hard they try or no matter how smart they are. <br/><br/>This film is really strange because the first two films were pretty much puzzle films. Many people probably liked the first two films because of the puzzling aspects of those films. But unfortunately for sAW3(at least until the end, where the twists occur) there really aren't any aspects of the film that really make you think about the situations.<br/><br/>What replaces it are some truly painful and disturbing scenes of torture and gore that become nearly unwatchable for the faint-hearted. This film is a true gore-fest in the latest tradition, and while I'm glad that they totally topped HOSTAL in that area, I'm hesitant to recommend this film. But if you are a fan of gore, which many who saw the first two films were, boy oh boy are you in for a treat!!! This film is probably the goriest film so far this year. For example, there's a device called ""The Rack"" in which a man has his head, arms, and legs all plastered up to a big machine. And every once in a while, the spokes twist and twist his arms and legs and neck with it. Needless to say, there is a lot of snapping bones and compound fracture complete with overdone sound effects and gore. In another awesome scene, a woman has her entire ribcage torn out while attached to a metal apparatus.<br/><br/>So yeah, generally i'd say if you love gore, check it out, if you're looking for a good puzzle film, try to sit through it till the end. If you have a strong stomach and are looking for something scary for Halloween, check it out. Although certainly not as scary or intense as THE DEPARTED, it has a couple edge of your seat moments that should get you good. Check it out.<br/><br/>Rated R for strong grisly violence and gore, sequences of terror and torture, nudity and language."

It's a great movie and helps fill in the holes from previous Saw movies. It's well acted, well shot. The suffering and screaming is frightening, I wouldn't want to endure any of the games. But I understand why. It's a franchise of horror, violence that justifys the direction throughout. I never saw the twist at the end and like the other Saw movies, it's just as memorable. Get sucked in, get involved with the people you see on the screen and understand why Jigsaw does what he does."
"joeydoa","6","2","3","28 October 2006"," It's no use trying... (put on Phantasm or Witchfinder General instead).
","An unrelenting assault on the viewer's senses for 90 minutes does rate as something horrific, yet one becomes numb and disinterested, especially in the lack of the tempo... all fast - no emotional modality... no connections to the outside world. The whole story is so insular that it neglects to connect with the audience and fails to set up an alternative world that the viewer is welcomed into and finds inviting. In short, what this movie lacks is imagination and a storyline. It hath no substance - the non-stop shock card is played all too often by those lacking of true talent. In contrast, setup of the true horror films such as the Italian giallo - Dario Argento, Lucio Fulcio, Mario Bava and the Modern American horror slasher (with back-story) represented by John Carpenter and Don Coscarelli evoke a more authentic response of terror - such as a simple scene from Phantasm when the Tall man says, ""You play a good game BOY!!!"" is far more menacing, terrifying and enigmatic than any line of dialog from any Saw movie (especially the latest installment)... In fact in Saw III, the psychological element of torture is merely a poorly worded treatise relying upon convention and boiled down philosophy. It lightly touches on the psychological but never the metaphysical. It is a self-absorbed exercise at best... so a 6/10 for doing torture for no rhyme or reason for 90 minutes straight. At best, the movie is a representation of worthlessness which brings to mind Sartre's much more profound philosophical novel, Nausea - which deals with the metaphysical problem of worthlessness in an erudite enlightening manner. To see a film that truly deals with sadism, torture and man's inhumanity to man I recommend Michael Reeves masterpiece: the Witchfinder General. Check it out. tho its not available on DVD in the USA, only videotape. I recommend the UK DVD."

On the other end of the story, a man named Jeff is the new victim in Jigsaw's puzzles who tries to solve them to get to the man who killed his son in a freak accident.<br/><br/>The signature plot twists are still as good as they were in Saw I & II, you'll still be surprised and pretty ""WOW""'d by the finale.

With his stupid voice, I'm surprised the police ever had a hard time finding the guy. Hell, he even looks like a killer. How stupid are the people who make these movies? How much scarier would it have been if they had chosen the last person you would ever expect to be behind such a thing, like a young man who works in a supermarket, or an elderly woman. No, instead they choose some character actor who has spent his life perfecting the look and facial expression of a killer from the imagination of an idiot.<br/><br/>The movie sort of has a main character in some guy who's angry because his kid died, and Jigsaw gives him the opportunity to take revenge. The movie doesn't tell his story strongly enough, and there's too much other garbage muddling it all up. At least the first movie in the series didn't have that problem.

I think what I liked most about these sequels is that the director was willing to kill off many main characters from the earlier films. This sequel also benefits from James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the writers of the original film, returning to write the film. This time Jigsaw, Tobin Bell, dying in a hospital bed, but with the help of Shawnee Smith is still able to carry out his games, kidnapping a doctor who's son was killed in a hit-and-run accident and putting him through a series of games/choices/situations where he can exact his revenge on those responsible. The first ""Saw"" film was unfairly written off as torture porn, when it's really a terrific suspense thriller that happens to be excruciatingly gory. However, the subsequent sequels, this one included, are the typification of the torture porn genre, which is either a good or bad thing depending upon your feelings of the horror sub genre. As films of this disreputable genre go, ""Saw III"" is nowhere close to being as good as ""Martyrs"" or ""Hostel,"" but is far better than the worst of the genre (i.e. ""Turistas"" or the ""I Spit on Your Grave"" remake). Donnie Wahlberg, Dina Meyer, and Betsy Russell also appear in the film, and composer Charlie Clouser returns to provide another effectively unsettling score."

","I loved first movie. I am aware that sequels are often worse than original, but I expected them to stick to formula that worked so well in first movie, so even if sequels have no quality they would at least be fun. I saw second Saw that pretty much keep up with first one and I could not wait to see more. I never expected such unpleasant surprise. I knew this franchise will in time most probably lose some of its awesomeness, but such drastic drop in quality between two contiguous movies really surprised me. Saw III is not so bad by itself, but in comparison with first two this is complete catastrophe. First, it is boring. Few scenes twist stomach pretty successfully, but to achieve that effect one does not need much skill. Tension, suspension and fear are nowhere to be found. Second, this movie insults my intelligence. Unlike in prequels, story is completely linear, boring and predictable. And in addition to that it's full of holes and illogicality. Characters and their actions are unconvincing, especially Jeff. He lost so much time in every room for no obvious reason. If himself was threatened in any way I could understand his hesitation, but he was not. I have no nerves to get into the details, cause it would take to long. Further, flashbacks are lousy and have no purpose in story. For those who saw previous two films they just make this one more boring and unnecessarily stretch it to almost two hours. Last and the biggest disappointment was the end. Regardless of your taste and opinion about first two Saw movies, one thing you have to acknowledge and it's genius mindfak twist that ends them both. Here, they could not make effort even to achieve that. Ending is totally predictable. I knew how it will end, but I hoped that movie made me think that on purpose so they could make even bigger surprise when it ends differently, but that did not happen. It ended just as I suspected and I felt deprived. Movie ends in manner of low-budget gore horrors. In those it's not a flaw cause they do not pretend to be more than they are - movies based on disgusting scenes that do not need intelligent plot to achieve their purpose. But in Saw franchise that present itself as intelligent mystery thriller this is unforgivable. First hour I was bored but hoping that it will get better in time. During second half I was just sad and had to force myself not to give up before the end.<br/><br/>5/10"
"blumdeluxe","6","1","1","17 August 2017"," It starts to worsen
","""Saw III"" brings back the Jigsaw killer, this time so weak that he has to kidnap a doctor to keep him alive while his obsessed assistant prepares a final game with a man who lost everything when his son got killed during a car accident and seeks revenge for it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this part is not nearly as good as the first two have been. It is still a solid movie, don't get me wrong, but it feels a bit like the producers are desperately trying to bring in elements of surprise which doesn't work out as well as it did before. Instead, there are several backflashs that make it sometimes hard to keep up with the story and the stringency that was a center-piece of the first two parts, goes missing at least partly. What you get is still a dark and sinister thriller that keeps you entertained but it sometimes tries to hard to be a Saw movie.<br/><br/>All in all you do nothing wrong by giving this a try but you should know that you can't expect something as carefully balanced as the other parts of the series."
"bttiss","8","1","1","30 November 2006"," this film feels more like saw 1 than saw 2 did
","the overall film was amazing to watch, particularly the operation scene where they open up jigsaws head to relieve pressure to his brain, the drilling is particularly creepy and hurt my ears too (a bit too loud for me) but then again i saw it in the cinema. anyway the overall film is great and feels like the first saw but more elaborate. the only flaw (if you can call it a flaw) in it would have to be jigsaw dying, not his actual death but the fact Jeff tries to save everyone, but when it comes to jigsaw he cant let go of the fact he ""voilated"" his wife and yet all this pent up anger of the jury, etc seems to rub off like nothing,eventually. the best twist in the film was that adam didn't die of starvation, but was actually killed by amanda (she put a bag over his head) overall i would have to say that this film isn't as bad as a lot of people have said (not naming anyone like) and i genually cant believe that people went to the cinema to see saw 3 when they hadn't seen the other two. IT'S A FILM Purely FOR THE FANS!!!!!!!!!"
"MaximumMadness","8","1","1","28 November 2006"," ""Saw III"" a gory fun time, and worthy conclusion to the series...
","I was a giant fan of the original ""Saw"" film, which I feel crosses a lot of lines when it came to genre. Most would classify it as a horror film, while others would call it a psychological-thriller, and others would merely call it a splatter-movie. I think it covered all these categories, making it fresh and original in terms of modern thrillers.<br/><br/>""Saw II"" tried very hard to be a more psychological film, but in my opinion fell short, though it did deliver the gore it promised and was still an over all fun movie.<br/><br/>Now, ""Saw III"" is out, the third and presumably final ""Saw"" film. It dabbles slightly in the psychological side of the characters, but only enough to justify the film's true purpose... blood... and lots of it. It seems the filmmakers Darren Lynn Bousman (Director) and James Wan and Leigh Whannell (Writers) have embraced the gore-fest aspect of the first two films full on this time.<br/><br/>The story goes something like this... Jigsaw, the brutal man who tests his victim's will to survive is finally dying. His new apprentice Amanda has kidnapped a young nurse to keep him alive. If she can keep him alive long enough, she will be let go.<br/><br/>At the same time, a man in constant mourning after the death of his son is being tested as well. He can chose to let those indirectly responsible live or die. And each step brings him closer to the man who actually killed his son.<br/><br/>These parallel story lines both work as one unit, being intertwined by Amanda and Jigsaw. The nurse must keep Jigsaw alive until the man seeks his final vengeance (or forgiveness) of his son's killer.<br/><br/>However, I wish the storyline involving the man and his dead son was a whole movie on it's own. It works as is, but would be more powerful as it's own stand-alone film.<br/><br/>Overall though, the film delivers what it promises, and is a worthy conclusion to the ""Saw"" trilogy."
"sheed2120","8","1","1","6 November 2006"," There Will Be A Saw 4
","There will be a saw 4 and Jigsaw will be in it.<br/><br/>Mathews and Dr.Gordon are both still alive. The same writers and directors will be returning. This was confirmed to me via an IHS.<br/><br/>Saw 4 will clear up all the Questions about Mathews, Obi, Adam, Amanda ( Who is dead). Tobin Bell will return and play his part as Jigsaw. Adam really had a task. The only way he could have lived would be to get the key out of the bath, but as we see, he lost the key in the very first seconds of the game. The saw was only meant for Adam, that was his way out. Killing Adam was Dr. Gordon's rest off, yea, it was great when Dr Gordon snapped, you could see he had finally had enough and needed to do anything to get out to help his family, Adam had no such urgency so he didn't saw his foot off, neither of the 2 had urgency to save themselves but Gordon did for his family.<br/><br/>And yea, Jigsaw was drugged, thats how he was motionless all that time, as for the electrocution, the first one was done by Zepp when he was watching on the monitors that were inside the mirror, but the second time he electrocuted Adam himself when he tried to shoot him (Adam was out of bullets anyway).<br/><br/>I think the situation was lose lose for Adam, because ether way he would die, if he saw his foot off, Zepp would have had to kill him and Gordon after the time limit (or was it just Gordon, only seen it the once so I cant quite remember). But if Gordon shot Adam Zepp would have had to let him go to get the antidote for the posion from jigsaw. I'm sure if they both cut their foots off they could have jumped Zepp when he came in to kill them and tried to escape, but we will never know, sucks about the key going down the bath plug hole though.<br/><br/>I'm guessing you haven't seen Saw 3 yet? thats more gory than Saw 1 and 2 put together."
"raaesquire","1","6","15","29 October 2006"," Crap is Crap is Crap
","Maybe it's just me, but the horror genre has no real artistic merit. The only horror films that matter are Rosemary's Baby, Rosemary's Baby, Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, Psycho, The Exorcist, Halloween, and even Evil Dead (not the other two, it became a parody of itself like the other long winded franchises). Otherwise than that, how could anyone feel confident about the American cinema today after seeing garbage like this? I certainly can't, as Saw III (just like its predecessors, possibly the two worst films ever made) takes the title as worst film of 2006.<br/><br/>The reason why the Saw franchise is considered great by the fans that believe in it because there is essentially no difficult content: there's blood, guts, and gore right in your face, plastic dialogue, screaming, yelling, and predictable plot twists explained at the end of the movie instead of having the viewer feel free to interpret things on his or her own. This is the sad status of mainstream Hollywood today: the executives notice a trend and exploit it. The horror genre was never good to begin with from its inception unlike the comedy genre, which was very intelligent in the beginning, but now we get films such as Employee of the Month with that jackass Dane Cook. An interesting film genre was exploited by the studios many years ago. Sure, they were in it for the money, but one little movie caused an uproar. It was called Citizen Kane, and it was a major player (not the only one) that kicked off the film noir genre. While film noir was not the most uplifting of genres, it had different narratives, was cleverly written (see no further than the Maltese Falcon or Sunset Blvd), and effectively reflected the mood of the times. So, I suppose the pointlessly bloody gorefest flicks with possessed children and stupid puppets in videos serves as expressionism of people's frustrations over America's status in the world? No, absolutely not. What 14 year old kid is going to think about this stuff when seeing Saw III? The only thing I was thinking about was how much money I wasted over seeing this crap. I could have seen a relatively unknown picture (with a lot of critical buzz) such as Brick or good mainstream fare (The Departed, even though it has the pretty faces of DiCaprio and Damon present).<br/><br/>The sad thing is that Saw III will be so much of a rousing box office success this weekend that studio execs will be pressuring for a forth one, but real film fans know full well that 2 sequels to the original were definitely unnecessary.<br/><br/>The only things that uplifted my spirits after seeing Saw III was that I will not have to see it again because it was so bad, Borat comes out next week, and that I went home and watched a real work of cinematic art entitled 'The 400 Blows' by Francois Truffaut. If you think Jigsaw teaches a valuable lesson to ungrateful people by torturing them, Francois Truffaut teaches a lesson 10000000000 times more worth the value: you don't want to be a punk kid wandering the streets of France without parents who don't love you.<br/><br/>See that instead or any foreign film for that matter instead of Saw III."
"jasonkimmel1234567890","1","5","12","28 October 2006"," very gory but doesn't come with much of a story
","In this movie, however great the end twist (usually associated with saw movies) is, does not even begin to justify the means. The movie's gore level in the first ten minutes far exceeds that of the first two movies combined. In the previous saw movies ***spoiler for saw 1 and 2*** the endings were by no means happy endings, but ****spoiler for saw 3**** this movie's ending is so terrible that it left no room for thought like the others had. Now that is my personal opinion and by giving you no specific details I will let you formulate your own opinion when you go see the movie. In other words me saying that it is gory and that it doesn't have a great plot aren't spoilers. That's why I don't have standard spoiler warnings but rather my own because this ""in my opinion"" is the best review done by a proclaimed saw fan. If you haven't seen the first two saw movies and you aren't going into the theater with high, and biased because of the other two, expectations then you might think that the movie is okay, but you wouldn't understand some of the things that are going on as they relate directly to the first two movies.<br/><br/>As a big saw fan, this movie was a tremendous letdown. Like I said though, if I hadn't had such high hopes and if I hadn't been waiting so long then the utter terribleness of this movie wouldn't have been such a bad thing."

","First off i was never a fan of the Saw series, i found them to be just another clichÃ© dumb horror movie. When Saw III came out this Friday all of my friends voted on going to see SAW III while i wanted to go watch the Prestige. I hated the movie from the very start with the over use of language that is so unnecessary (that goes for all the saw movies.) I then only last 15 minutes and left the theater for home. My girlfriend was on the verge of fainting and was in a cold sweat and she turned her had and didn't see half of the gore. <br/><br/>I came to realize that our society is messed up beyond belief when masses file in to watch fellow human beings be torn apart. When i ask people about the saw movies what is so good about them they all answer with how gory and cool it was. Personally i am disgusted by this ""film"" and wouldn't watch it if it was the last movie on earth. (that means i'd take Ultraviolet or Godzilla over this movie any day) <br/><br/>Among the blood and guts there may be a story but no matter if its good or not its not worth the 98% of the movie which is figuring out how we can best kill someone. PATHETIC"

","I'm a fan of the first SAW movie. It was really an intelligent, thrilling and interesting movie. Then came SAW II. It wasn't really good, but it was a !little bit! entertaining. But then, I saw SAW III at the preview and I nearly fell asleep. It was so awful. The story is so artificial andm unrealistic, that it hurts. Jigsaw's games are now really stupid and bad planned. And there's no real context. The Actors, without Jigsaw, are also chosen very well :D. All in all, its hard to believe, that James Wang made this third movie of SAW. He made the 1st and it was great. He didn't make SAW II and this movie failed. And now he made SAW III, and he didn't fail, he rocked the bottom.<br/><br/>MY ADVISE: SAVE UR MONEY AND WATCH THE ONLY REAL SAW MOVIE"

","If you're a fan of the first two movies, this is more of the same and you don't need to read this, just go see the movie. If you didn't like the first two films this is more of the same and you don't need to see the film.<br/><br/>More of the same from Jigsaw, a serial killer who wants people to experience ""life"".<br/><br/>Say what you will the filmmakers know how to make a great looking grotesque film. The images from this film absolutely are stunning, as are their designs for the weapons of small scale destruction. I love the look of the film.<br/><br/>What I don't like is the films mindless cruelty. People are abused in the nastiest way possible. There is no reasoning behind it, just cruelty like when the condemned were fed to the wild animals in the Roman arena. While I will admit its well done, I hate that there is nothing behind it. The murders have become like the films that made up the spate of slasher films from the late 1970's and early 1980's which degenerated into clever ways to die with nothing to hold them together.<br/><br/>Worse is the films lack of logic. Never mind that Jigsaw has expired any number of times, how do this very elaborate death traps get made and built and attached to unsuspecting people in such short notice. It makes no sense? I know its not suppose to, but there should be an internal logic to it all and any hope of that ended with the first film.<br/><br/>This won't matter to any fans who are looking for the cool ways to die.

"TdSmth5","6","4","9","2 November 2006"," So so
","While I liked Saw I and haven't seen Saw II, Saw III is just so so. It has a new story but it also interweaves an explanation of what happens behind the scenes of Saw I. The good thing is that this movie is gory and has some full frontal nudity. The bad things is that there is no character to care or root for and that Dina Meyer, who is reunited with Costas Mandylor after their excellent but short-lived Secret Agent Man TV show, gets only a short tertiary role. The main problem with this movie is that the Jigsaw character is neither scary-the mask is stupid, nor likable in a twisted sort of way, in the way one would like Jason. In the first Saw his philosophizing about life and pain is quite interesting, here it's not. It's the same stuff: you don't appreciate such and such, pain this or that, it's your choice bla bla. He's supposed to be a new Pinhead but Pinhead's thoughts on pleasure and pain were actually memorable. In Saw III we find a guy trapped who we are told is suffering due to the accidental death of his son and now he is bitter and vengeful. His life is shown in photographic flahsbacks so we don't really care much about him. He's on some sort of scavenger hunt designed by Jigsaw that takes him to different people-in-a-trap scenes. The traps are somewhere interesting, but again, that story line is not really emphasized. The main story line is a dying John trying to get himself cured. This movie is awefully long. I could swear it was nearly 2 hours long. It's too loud as well, a means filmmakers use to keep you from falling asleep, every step someone takes sounds like the whole theater is going to come crashing down. As is typical for bad scriptwriting, the whole thing is supposed to unravel in the last five minutes, everything is explained- of sorts, not just what happens here but also what happened in Saw I. Frankly by then I just don't care. While the twist is alright, the story line of the trapped guy is not given enough character depth. Everything is just too convoluted and we are expected to believe that Jigsaw is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent. For his plans to work out, and they always do, so many factors have to go his way, it's just absurd. And when you think it's over, guess what, he knew that, too and that was part of his plan. Personally I'm not a fan of Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith, the main actors here. They are good second-tier actors but they can't carry a movie. This series has potential but someone else needs to be Jigsaw and the stories need to be less convoluted."

","Well, After watching saw 1, it certainly was a good film, so I was excited to see saw 2. Then i watched saw 2, which in my opinion was brilliant!! beating saw 1, so my hopes once again raised. I finally got to see saw 3 last night, but sadly, i have to say i wasn't to impressed. First of all, lets get one thing out of the way. On Gore factor, this film most definitely tops the other 2 for goriness and gross visual effects, so if you like those sorts of films, this one is definitely a must see. However, for actual plot and content, unlike the other 2 films, this one seems to be running thin. It does have a plot to some extent, but the actual content in the film seems a little rushed and although it does make sense, seems to lack what the other 2 did so well. The acting was to a fairly good standard, but Shawnee Smith (Amanda) Definitely takes the best performance for this film. Al in all, its not a bad film, I would still suggest watching it, but for those who have high hopes from the other two movies, I feel that the majority of you will be disappointed."

"ptb-8","1","3","6","31 October 2007"," I sat I saw I sank.
","I have racked my brain to see what limits I can put on my sadness and disgust at this SAW franchise. So far I have made it through 1 2 and the vile 3. These films are a celebration of hatred and mutilation presented to 20 year olds to develop their taste for pitiless violence towards distressed victims. As graphic as pornography and as pulverizing as a steel-mill, these films are made to traumatize..... and then promise the spectacle of victim violence mixed with humiliation irrationality and plain viciousness. It makes a recipe for some sort of Corporate mind destruction towards young people who have not had much experience in humanity... so these films are designed to pour acid onto their young optimistic minds, to vandalize the senses and to entertain criminals... and develop a taste for inhuman destruction of the human body as 'a fun experience'. It also saddens me greatly that the original films were created by immature Australian boys who were seized upon by the American Corporate Machine that specializes in making sure these vicious pitiless traumatic exercises in evil reach the widest audience possible. These films are designed to show you hatred. To make a spectacle of the hatred and for you and your kids to enjoy watching the hatred. The relentless destruction of the human form pantomiming as 'scary fun' is probably the biggest most insidious evil permeating our 'culture'. Hooray for Hollywood as it is from there that this emanates; no other country exports so much visual hatred as America. No wonder less and less people go to the cinemas. Seeing other humans screaming in pain begging for their lives and dying in agony from mutilating wounds is so very sad in any film. For it to become a 'horror genre' is an absolute tragedy and a massive challenge in this early part of a bright new century. This section of what was an exciting vibrant film industry was once applauded for 'cinema verite' .........now it is to be condemned for what has mutated into 'cinema cruelite'. There is nowhere for these torture chamber films to go.... unless baby beating is forthcoming. (Eli Roth? sounds spossible)...."
"homecoming8","9","3","6","19 July 2007"," A Must Have Trilogy, Part III completes it all..
","Saw I was a great and surprising movie, a so-called ""sleeper"". A sequel was unavoidable, the reviews were not great, but I thought it was a great movie with good acting and scary gore, although the story seemed a lot like the CUBE franchise. SAW III rounds it all up, it goes over the top when it comes to gore, but there are a lot of surprising twists, the cast is once again great, and the story gets you and won't let go for a second. The Saw Trilogy is without a doubt one of my favorite horror-franchises of the last few years. I know they already have filmed Part IV and even V, and possibly a sixth for the near future... I have very mixed feelings about this, because the story is really over after the third one. It usually doesn't get better, remember the Hellraiser-franchise ? Everything after Part III should be sent straight back to Hell! But back to earth, SAW I-III is a great and entertaining trilogy no one should miss, sometimes a little sadistic like HOSTEL, but few movies get under your skin like this one. And everyone is in for a good scare now and then."
"Izbeza","10","3","6","26 May 2007"," Saw 3 is amazing
","Saw 3 was for me much better than saw 2. I think that i even liked it more than the first one. If you re looking for a gory and suspenseful movie with an unbelievable plot you should go see Saw 3. It has the best torture scenes by far out of the three Saw movies. It will keep you thinking about the movie for days and maybe even weeks after you see the movie. Saw 3 also explains many unanswered questions from the first and second movies. I absolutely loved Saw 3 and the other saw movies and i think that if you have seen the other saw movies and liked them you should definitely see Saw 3. Also because Saw 4 was announced and from reading the plot summary of it, Saw 4 seems that much of the movie is based on Saw 3, so if you plan on watching Saw 4 it is probably very important to see saw 3 to understand it. Nobody should go without seeing saw 3 it blew my mind with all the twists and turns. i hope that you rent it."
"aktowfik","4","3","6","1 March 2007"," Too much gore
","What the hell were these guys trying to do when they made this movie ?..They are entirely sick and sadistic, never mind how clever they are. I liked Saw I very much, but for God's sake, these guys don't know the difference between terror, horror and gore. Seeing a trephine done with elementary tools; or a man drowned in pig juice; or a throat cut by a saw is not horror..it's simply disgusting. If you want gore and shock, then any clip from Iraq showing the real slaughtering of a prisoner can do better. The make-up guys did everything possible to prove they earned their buck, and they did it well. My impression is that they made this film as a catalogue documentary for what they can do, so they can make contracts with other production companies. The thrills are childish, like a school kid trying to scare the hell out of the chicks by eating frogs or removing his decayed tooth in front of them. This is disgusting.. It ought to bring some screams , but this is not cinema ..this is not horror. We used to think Lucio Fulci was sick.. Now we know he was a romantic film maker. Apart from that, I can't accept this plot anymore. I can't believe 2 persons are able to design all these satanic demonic shows. This would have taken an army of technicians. The only good thing about this movie is Shawnee Smith... She scared the hell out of me, and everything about her acting was legendary as usual.You can never believe she's not really insane. Her eyes were scary.. Her skin was scary.. her voice was scary... This lady is the most gifted and most underrated actress in Cine business today...."

","OK, I am one of those few, that did not like the film that much. And I can hardly understand why people find SAWIII such good film...<br/><br/>First of all, throughout the movie I kept asking myself how one that is obviously in a very bad condition (the killer) has the power, wit, logistics, money to come up with all the mechanic torture devices.<br/><br/>How is he or Armanda able to get the victims where they are? Where the hell does all this take place without being noticed by authorities - the killer is no stranger to the police, right?<br/><br/>Lack of logic everywhere. My mind confronted me with a lot of questions all the time and that took away a lot of entertainment.<br/><br/>SAWI had a lot of elements. It had gore, suspense, police-investigation, hope, despair. All of which were put together with excellence. It worked on a lot of levels.<br/><br/>SAWIII lacks almost everything except the gore. I don't like when I get the impression that the lack of plot-ideas is compensated with gore-scenes that make you cringe.<br/><br/>There was almost no investigation-scenery going on. It was focused basically on one theme - the torture&despair of the victims. I find this to be a bit one-dimensional.<br/><br/>However, and maybe that was simply the intention, it was hard to watch the whole thing, I did feel uncomfortable and I was not in a good mood after wards. It had a moving finale, but more because I felt very sorry for the two main-characters, instead of being surprised by some awesome ending-clue. OK, there was something greater going on with Armanda but that did not convince me.<br/><br/>SAW I had the most striking final seconds a film can have.<br/><br/>The ending of SAWIII is just terrible sad and drama-like.<br/><br/>I did find the film to be entertaining because of my latent voyeurism - watching people die is one reason we watch horror, but if it is reduced to this one basic concept it does not succeed to fully entertain me.<br/><br/>Since SAW IV is already planned, even SAWV: I wonder what sense this makes? The concept is pretty much dead, and the ending of SAWIII somewhat makes it hard to continue the story.<br/><br/>Sorry guys, this was a disappointment, However if you enjoy watching people die by sick torture-devices, this is for you. If you want an interesting story on top of it, i guess you should look elsewhere.<br/><br/>Oh yes, I apologize for my somewhat strange English."

","Saw I = amazing and original. Saw II = wow, for once, a movie is just as good or better than the original. Saw III = WTF ????<br/><br/>Extremely disappointed. The whole plot was screwed up. The Doctor was 3 breaths from dying in Saw II, eaten up with cancer. Now all of a sudden you spend 50 minutes leading up to some stupid operation that's only going to prolong the life of the doctor another, what, 2 hours? Plus you've got this guy Jeff that no one cares about, and we're not sure if we're supposed to be rooting for him or what, going through these tests, but he passes them all quite easily. In the first 2 Saw movies, you were -with- the poor saps going through these tests, and horrified with them. But Jeff just quietly bumbles through them. Leads up finally to the guy who ended up hitting his son with a car, all about vengeance and all that crap. <br/><br/>Then the whole intern, which was awesome in Saw II, starts getting all emotional and stupid in Saw III. This movie was such a waste. Flashbacks meant nothing. They probably filmed the scenes while doing Saw II, and Wahlberg realized what a crappy script Saw III was and he bailed, so to make some kind of transition seem to fit in, they threw in some flashback-deleted scenes reel from Saw II, showing Wahlberg trying to escape.<br/><br/>I was really surprised when i saw it was the same writers from Saw I and Saw II, i figured this was some new intern writer or something working on this one. Very disappointed."

","The first film was compelling and highly original; the second was below par and forgettable; this third entry is among the most repulsive I've ever watched: its relentless gloating (in glorious close-up) on pain and flesh ripping is positively insulting; I've yet to catch up with several recent horror titles but there's no clearer indication than this of how low the genre has sunk - it has literally gone down the drain! The plot itself is mildly intriguing and even features a nice final twist - but the film's parade of gore, creative torture devices (God only knows where the moribund 'avenger' picks up the various parts, not to mention the energy to build them!) and self-pitying characters makes for unintentional hilarity all the way through!"
"geeg23","2","3","6","8 January 2007"," Terrible....
","The first ""Saw"" was let down by mediocre acting and a ridiculous ending. I know I have seen the second ""Saw"" but it was a totally forgettable experience and I can only vaguely remember the odd scene. The third instalment? Terrible. There is no characterisation at all. You cannot care for the characters are they are all less than two dimensional. The ""plot"" is basically an excuse for one gore scene after another but it has no impact as you do not care for any of the characters. I am a big horror film fan but this is just utter rubbish. This was a complete waste of my time and it was also far too long. Please don't let them make a fourth one."
"phelaidar","4","3","6","7 January 2007"," A good film with bad choices
","When Saw was released people even mentioned that it was the one to beat Se7en in this style of films. And while in the same style as Se7en (Suspense, action, dead bodies, high violence and mystery) it was a very original film, with good acting and intense story full of twists.<br/><br/>This is a good sequel, but has some problems of wrong choices. The story is as smart as the ones from previous films, but the way it's told doesn't work well. It seems they wanted to get to the tension scenes and the ""games"" right from the start of the film. Problem is that by doing so, there was no presentation of Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) and his life outside the ""game"". While previous films always showed us something to feel for and understand the main character. By doing this, it's hard to understand or at least accept the father's reactions over the people trapped. We have not enough background information about why he acts this way or at least to know that he acts this way. People in traps have no development at all and are only in the film for the gore fest. In the other Saw films, the traps were made so people could learn their lesson, not only to kill innocent people. The important thing about character development is not to remember names but the actions they take, why, and the changes they go trough the whole film. And though the father had really bad development, Amanda and Dr. Lynn Denlon are great characters and very well developed trough the whole film, as you get to know them more. Jigsaw, though we don't get to know more about him, is as good as in the second Saw.<br/><br/>Other bad choice is the amount of gore in this sequel. Though a lot of fans like it, they are the fans who never really liked the film for what it was meant to be. A good story with violence, not lots of violence with story. There is so much gore that you actually stop felling tense during this scenes. Saw I and II kept you watching those sequences because of all the tension, not the gore. While in the previous ones you would be as tense, nervous and desperate as the characters, in this one you might even start telling yourself ""good make-up effects"" and won't get involved with the scene. The gore in the first and second was only shown when important.<br/><br/>The story is actually good and follow the previous events very well, and the acting is on the same level as in Saw I and II. One problem with it's story is the ending. Though it's full of twists and as good as the other endings, it is too unhappy even compared to Saw I/II endings. There is not enough hope in this film. During the whole film and in the end. While in the other films you feel like wanting to watch the next one, this one makes you feel bad and wanting to get out of the cinema as fast as you can because you feel like the characters have no reason to go on.<br/><br/>They tried to push the film to the next level, but unfortunately, they've chosen the wrong things to push. The gore fest feels like loss of originality, since we have films like Hostel, which brought back the senseless gore to the screen. The traps are a lot more complex, but lost their meaning. Characters are not the most important piece in this one. And the story, though not worse then the intelligent stories of Saw I/II was not pushed to the next level as we hoped it would."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>After taking care of two random victims, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) goes in for the kill and traps Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) a man in a deep state of grief after losing his son in a drink driving accident. He sets him a series of challenges to save the lives of those caught up in his sons death (including a female driver who failed to stop and help, the judge who gave the killer a pathetic sentence, and finally, the killer himself) to test his resolve and to stop him languishing in a state of veangefulness. Meanwhile, he also takes Jeff's wife Lynn (Bahar Soometh) a brash doctor who pushes everyone away from her to operate on the tumour that is killing him, with the help of Amanda (Shawnee Smith) his former victim.<br/><br/>All three of the Saw movies have seemed to pride themselves more on delivering stomach-churning gore than genuine scares and they've reached a crescendo with Saw III, a truly nasty piece of work that reportedly had paramedics being called in to deal with fainting cinema-goers who couldn't handle the movie's sheer level of blood and gore. There's plenty of morbidly imaginative Hellraiser style death scenes on display that see some characters die some of the grusomest deaths imaginable (check out the terrifying looking thing the drunk driver is attached to at the end and the torture he is made to endure!), but it's actually the most realistic gory scene that proves the hardest to stomach, where a drill is used to go into Jigsaw's skull and operate on his brain. Somehow seeing the real sort of thing is even nastier than the most unpleasant death device the screen-writers could dream up.<br/><br/>Plot wise, the movie's pretty defunct. We open with two murders that bear no relevance to the 'story' that's about to unfold, which basically consists of moving from one gory set-piece to another in a none stop attempt to turn the stomachs of the viewers as much as possible. There seems to be some ridiculous rhyme and reason to Jigsaw's motives, wherein a sadistic killer tries to make a man feeling justifiable anger and vengeance get his humanity back as well as trying to get people to appreciate life by making them crawl and scream for it. There's some fairly good acting on display though, Macfadyen raw and determined as the tragic anti-hero as well as Bell's calm, rationalizing psychopath but, unlikely as it seems, one just hopes this is the last of the odious Saw movies before the series gets the chance to get anymore morally adventurous. **"

","I was so upset with this movie. I absolutely love Saw and Saw 2 and I expected all the best for Saw 3. I couldn't wait to see the 3rd movie and I saw it on its opening week. The beginning was terrible and I wanted to leave right away. I stayed because of my loyalty to the first to movies. I thought the beginning was like a catch or whatever to get the audience pumped but oh no... it got worse, MUCH WORSE. This movie was NOTHING like the first 2. I have them on DVD and I watch them all the time. I doubt that I will ever see Saw 3 again. This was a complete torture movie and it was to hard to watch. I liked it better when ""Jigsaw"" was the only master mind instead of Amanda. She had some nasty games and the worse movie yet!"

","I went to see saw 3 last night and my mind is still boggling at the amount of twists and turns the movie crammed in yet again!! What an absolutely brilliant film, I didn't see how they could make it work but they pulled it off in perfect saw style. The traps were excellent yet again, the acting was top notch and the storyline was brilliant. It explained the previous films to a fuller extent and the story easily equalled the previous 2. I loved it and, as did the previous 2 films, it left me longing for more. I am pleased to hear about saw 4 although I am worried about overkill and the fact the writers and directors are changing. It is obviously for profit purposes and the story could suffer as a result, as could the credibility but if they do match it then this is going to be the first line of films that actually retains some dignity after going beyond 3 films. I hope that it is not a prequel as jigsaw has already explained his reasoning for doing what he does and I don't feel the need to elaborate on that. I also hope it does not ruin the saw franchise and it ends up with the respect it deserves as an entertaining, gripping, exciting and twist-filled set of films that fitted perfectly."
"mentalcritic","10","3","6","7 November 2006"," Why aren't you listening, Hollywood?
","After listening to the bitching and moaning exhibitors put on about how films are making less this year than last year, one has to wonder who is in charge there. Saw III proves a few things, not least of which is that spending two hundred million dollars to make a film is unnecessary. There is also a claim made by studios that a film has to be aimed to ""please everyone"" in order to make back its money. Saw III also turns that claim right on its ear. Saw III is indeed the first horror film, and indeed only the second film period, I have seen this year that could solidly be labelled as being for adults. And it grossed back its production budget three times over in one week. Why Hollywood does not take a cue from this is beyond me, and it seems to be beyond Hollywood, too. Although reception among critics and fans is sharply divided, Saw III is also easily the most intelligent and philosophical of the series to date. Although most people will miss the fact, it has quite a lot to say about our ability to confuse justice with revenge.<br/><br/>At heart, the Saw films are about people undergoing tests. Where Saw III distinguishes itself from its predecessors is that the tests are no longer about survival. The penalties for failure are still fatal, but the tests are a little deeper than those of the mere will to live. And everyone, save for the ringmaster that is Jigsaw, is being tested. Viewers who wondered what kind of apprentice Amanda would make after Saw II will be shocked and satisfied. In contrast to Saw II, however, the plot does not revolve around a group of individuals arguing with one another. Jigsaw is less in control of his games this time, leaving us with less cryptic (yet exceedingly obvious) clues to laugh at. Yet there is nothing he has failed to think out in advance, with every angle and variation accounted for. In another life, he could have been a championship chess player. However, one loose end remains for him, that of who will succeed him when the tumor that caused his epiphany in the first place finally gets the better of him.<br/><br/>Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell are literally on fire in this film. Smith plays an emotional wreck so convincingly it makes one wonder what she had been up to in the time she had seemed to disappear from the media. Anyone who doubts her acting chops will be floored as she acts out the consequences of Amanda failing to realise that she is being tested. The big drama of Saw III is that Jigsaw is now so frail that he can no longer set up his games unaided, and thus Amanda carries out most of the work for him. Kerry, the detective from the other two films, investigates the latest of the Jigsaw killings. She suspects something is afoul when she deduces that this trap was impossible to escape from. Fans of the first two films will remember that Jigsaw is all about playing by the rules, or at least being consistent with the rules he sets. I do not believe it is giving much away to say that Amanda has been playing a little game of her own in between carrying out Jigsaw's wishes, and that Jigsaw is not terribly impressed by this.<br/><br/>Woven into the story is the test of a man whose son was killed in a car accident, and forgotten by the justice system. In most Hollywood films, this would dissolve into a comment about how liberal our justice system is. Not so in Saw III. In Saw III, Jigsaw places his victim on a path to confront the people most directly involved both in the son's death and the minimal punishment the offender received. His challenge is to overcome his hatred of these people for long enough to be able to save each individual from some of the most ludicrously cruel contraptions seen in the series. Of course, it would not be a Saw film if people did not die in ironic ways, but the change here to leave the lives of several participants in the hands of another is exactly what is needed after familiarity with the standard scenario had been enforced by the other two films. The most peculiar variation on the original scenario comes from the fact that Jigsaw knows his death is imminent, and he delights in weaving that fact into the tests he sets those around him.<br/><br/>In case I have not made it clear enough, credit is due to the creativity of the filmmakers. Robert Rodriguez has said in at least two audio commentaries that once you turn on the money hose to wash away creative problems, you cannot turn it off again. Every dollar of the twelve million spent on filming Saw III was used to much greater effect than a lot of films that spend ten times that amount. Having seen the insides of my own arms and one of my feet, I can say without hesitation that in contrast to almost every other effect in horror films, the removal of a fragment of Jigsaw's skull made me ill. Special effects is meant to be an art of fooling people to believe they are looking at something they are not, and Saw III is one of the few feature films of recent years to accomplish this. I am sure a neurosurgeon or effects artist would be able to point out flaws in the scene other than the varying mark indicating drilling depth, but this scene alone is enough to put the fear of mortality into even the most jaded viewer. Rarely do I walk out of a theatre feeling this satisfied.<br/><br/>I gave Saw III a ten out of ten. If you are like me and prefer your horror uncompromisingly brutal, then it is essential viewing."

","Nothing, as in a blackness, a depravity, a hole into which maladjusted deviants, masturbate their crippled humanity into twisted shapes of death.<br/><br/>Violence has it's place in cinema, in places it makes a film. Kill Bill, Dawn of the Dead, Irreversible, all those films and their genres benefit from a bit of blood. But it's blood with artistry. Those zombies didn't die in vain, the Crazy 88 Gang were slaughtered and we cared. But in Saw III, I just didn't care. Not one bit. I just sat wondering where can filmic violence can go? Now mainstream cinema can show 'wound shots' and other graphic, horrendous violence, where does it go next? I wondered whether the main protagonist women would have sex with the people she was killing. It might have raised an eyebrow. Or made me think I should raise an eyebrow. Because in actuality, I didn't care. And you shouldn't. Saw III crosses the line. But you shouldn't care to watch it. It's a dreadful film. People have been throwing up and passing out all in cinemas across the UK in vain. You come out feeling violated, but it's all for nothing, because it's no badge of honour that you've seen Saw III. It is a poor excuse for cinema. It's strange, I've never felt bored and violated at the same time, but that sums up my experience.<br/><br/>It doesn't even tie up the series, there's another one to endure. The first two had compelling enough plot lines, this was sadly lacking.Will there be a plot in the next film? Or just go for the shock effect, perhaps killing some children, or sexually abusing them? Saw III = Dull, incoherent toss."

Gore has never bothered me and I have watched horror movies since I was a young child. ""Saw 3"" almost made me feel like puking. It is very gory.

","Every Halloween for the past 3 years I get excited. It means that its time for Saw. The violence, storyline, and always shocking twist endings combine to make a very enjoyable movie for me. As far as that's concerned Saw 3 delivers perfectly. It is just like all the Saw movies. The gore is everything to expect from a Saw movie lots of blood and horrible things. The traps and violence make me cringe and so far Saw is the movies are the only real movies that have been able to do that. The storyline is great for the most part and evens provides insight into past Saw movies, explaining back stories and such. As usual it has a twist ending that wasn't quite as good as Saw 1 or 2 but was still surprising compared to the endings of other movies. Don't expect anything to shocking but it is surprising. Like most Saw movies it does have its flaws. Saw 1 had its acting, Saw 2 had an overly complicated ending, Saw 3 combines a little of both. The acting is definitely a step down from Saw 2 which is saying something because no one from Saw 2 was exactly Oscar-worthy. Also while Saw had a surprise ending that was an instant shock, Saw 2 had a long ending with several twists, Saw 3 goes the Saw 2 with a long ending with several shocks one of which it pulls out of the bag way to early in the movie causing me to figure out a lot of it before it actually happens. However, measuring Saw 3 up to other movies it is a lot better than most crap that Hollywood dubs ""horror"" movies and so for that I give it a high rating. If you like gore or any of the other Saw movies you'll love Saw 3. If you like horror movies you'll like it. If you're squeamish you should go no where near it."

Saw III does create some closure at the end, but of course not all questions are completely answered. By not tying things up in a nice tidy way they leave the audience as unsettled as some of the gruesome devices used in the film. You walk out a bit freaked out, and at the same time something in the back of your head is going ""I want more"".<br/><br/>I especially like how III, through flashbacks, gave so much more depth to the characters and situations from the first two movies. Unlike most films where they use archived footage with a soft edge filter, there are scenes from the first two movies that are completely redone from he vantage point of another character.

","Well, after the disappointment of Saw 2, most people (myself included) figured that the only way this series could go was up, so you can imagine my surprise after seeing Saw III and finding out that it's actually worse! None of these films are very well written, and this dreary third instalment is no different as we're given an unimaginative central plot line that is nigh on impossible to care about, along with the usual amount of swearing, crying and sweaty people looking frightened in rooms that are often so dark that you can't see what's going on. Director Darren Lynn Bousman seems to have got it into his head that flashy editing equals good storytelling, but that is a ridiculous assumption, as all the editing does is make it hard to see what's happening - and that means that all the effort put into the film where the gore and ""inventive"" traps are concerned is ultimately wasted as you can never really appreciate it while you're squinting at the screen trying to make out what's happening. This all happens mostly in complete darkness as well, don't forget.<br/><br/>The plot line is of the 'highly convenient' variety, as despite being bed-ridden with terminal cancer, Jigsaw has somehow managed to find a man who hates a lot of people for murdering his son. Naturally he wants to play 'a game' with him, and so he's bunged him into some grotty place along with all the people he hates, and they're all hooked up to grisly traps - the idea being that he has to forgive to win the game...etc etc. Meanwhile, Jigsaw has got the doctor in to help him with his cancer - the catch being that if he dies, her head blows up. Believe it or not, this plot gets even more convenient once we get to the final twist. I actually feel quite insulted that the writers of this twaddle actually thought that people would buy into it - there is no reason to care about absolutely anything in this film! The film gets messier still when the director tries to tie all three films together with a series of boring and distracting flash backs where Jigsaw's assistant 'Amanda' remembers stuff they've done together. All in all, Saw III is a load of crap and I'm struggling to come up with anything good to say about it - and that's not usually something that happens when a film is as gory as this one. The kids might like it, but serious horror fans will need to look elsewhere for their thrills."

"mijnheertim","1","3","7","10 July 2007"," Probably the worst sequel ever
","I'm not stating that 'Saw' and 'Saw II' are two of the best horror movies of the last decade - neither of them come even close to a top 20 spot. But at least I was positively surprised after seeing them. Especially 'Saw II' turned out much better then I -and almost everybody else for that matter- expected, given my traditional skeptic attitude toward sequels. Mainly based on that experience, I sort of looked forward to the 'sequel of the sequel', the final chapter in the story of the Jigsaw Killer. Well, after-wards, I must say I feel rather silly and stupid for being excited about a flick like 'Saw III'. After only 10 minutes (when a police woman's chest is ripped in two right after 'the old' Jigsaw Killer one minute to chose between life or death routine'), you can conclude that this movie will never live up to the standard Saw-expectations. No thrills, no nerve tangling tension, no clever games, no slight reflection of the elements that made the first two Saws worthwhile and entertaining to watch . Nothing but pieces of flesh and skin being teared to shreds, spilling a lot of meaningless blood, produced by horrific, absurd machines. And for those who figured I was still talking about that police woman's scene: too bad, I was reflecting on the whole 110 minutes. This movie is tasteless and dumb. Even the plot doesn't make any sense, it's nothing but flashback after flashback, retelling story lines of 'Saw' and 'Saw II' instead of creating a new one. I venture they made half of 'Saw III' by montaging director's cut-scenes from the first two Saws. A very economical way of film-making of course, but also boring and very, very frustrating. To everybody with a weak cardiac condition, I wouldn't recommend 'Saw III' - not because of the tension mind you, but merely because of the frustrations and crushed hopes this movie generates."

","First of all, I am a huge Saw I & II fan. Quite possibly my favorite movie series ever made. I had very big expectations going into this and was very much let down. It almost seems like the writer was searching for a storyline. The movie is pieced together and does not flow well at all. And just as the comment before me says, it is incredibly gory. The blood and guts is way over done. The great thing about the Saw movies was that they weren't solely revolved around the gruesomeness. The Saw movies have incorporated incredible writing and wit, but this one changed that. It seemed like the goal of the movie was to show as much blood as possible. There are a lot of loose ends that need to be tied up, but I can't really see them justifying yet another movie. Basically, the soul of the Saw series was lost in this one. Slightly enjoyable, but overall a big let down."
"lisakiely","4","3","7","28 October 2006"," What the heck...change the rules at the last hurdle
","I am not a big fan of the films, and go along just because my friends do, however i do like the idea that you have to play the game to survive. Was a bit confused with this film because the rules are not there, and they haven't been since the very beginning. I understand that the whole three films have been a game to test Amanda suitability but everyone we watched play the game die - even the people who win - so what was the point. Effectively everyone dies, no one survives and the film no longer has the ability to capture its fans, who enjoyed the rules of the game. On top of this you connect more with the storyline and become attached to the characters. You also see how sick jigsaw is, because i am sure anyone who has lost there son would want revenge, and Jeff, when given the option to seek it fights with his inner demons and eventually chooses not to. Jeff then finds out his wife has been held hostage by jigsaw and has been shot. When jigsaws asks for forgiveness without showing remorse i would kill him to! I give the film an excellent gory factor of 9/10 because it was the best out of all three for this."
"tmzaepfel","10","3","7","27 October 2006"," Saw fans will not be disappointed.
","Saw III has all the gore and gruesomeness you could want, but that isn't the reason that we watch, is it? It's Jigsaw that fascinates us. He is such an amazing judge of the human condition, though his methods are quite.... disturbing... We understand why he does what he does. Maybe not to the full extent (yet), but enough to make us come back and see Saw again and again.<br/><br/>The Saw movies are more than just a bloody horror series. They make us think. Too many ""horror"" films these days are about the cheap scares, maximizing the use of today's technology, making the bloodiest, goriest movie they can disgust us with. Saw is so much more than that. Movies like Hostel and Texas Chainsaw Massacre don't haunt you, mess with your mind like Saw does. A horror movie that does more than try to scare you is my definition of a well done movie.<br/><br/>""I want to play a game. The rules of the game are simple.""

"outlawx4","1","4","11","27 October 2006"," Awful Beyond Awful
","I cannot understand how the original creators (Whinnell and Wan) who wrote such an excellent first film, could go on to write one of the worst two hours in modern film-making. This film is not just awful in itself, but is so awful that it ruins the original film for me as well. The only redeeming characteristic of the film is Donnie Wahlbergs (brief) appearance. And even that is not all that impressive. None of the characters are convincing, or even likable. And you can tell that the entire film was just built around the fact that they want to kill as many people in as many bizarre ways as possible. That cannot be the premise for any film.Do not waste your time or money with this money hungry cop out from wannabe filmmakers.<br/><br/>Awful."
"YourDecision11","4","2","4","29 January 2011"," Out with the mind games, in with the gore...
","I remember seeing the first movie, walking out and thinking, ""wow, what a great horror movie. It had both story and good thrills!"" The second one, I thought, still not the worst story, but the gore contributed positively to the movie and still made another great horror film. Saw 3....made for the money. I thought the traps in the film weren't as deep and didn't have as much meaning as the first two films. All this movie really did was kill person after person and move on, which is your typical slasher flick that no one gets surprised from. The original story portrayed in the first movie is lost and misplayed and loses out to torturing and watching people suffer. Darren Lynn Bousman, who directed Saw 2 and did it very well, tried to keep the same style with Saw 3, but it ran out of magic here. Bousman wants to keep a dark atmosphere with suspenseful music in the background while the gore piles on, but there is no story to back him up, so the formula fails. In fact, anything that tries to show substance ends up failing, either due to the screenplay or due to Bousman's formula. Jigsaw as a character is still written well, with James Wan and Leigh Whannell still getting credit for sticking with the franchise, but it's the rest that doesn't merit my attention. Saw 3 doesn't capitalize on what Saw 2 did well, gore and story, but Jigsaw continues to be a thrilling character who whenever he says something, it catches the audiences' eye. The traps are gory, but they are unbelievable and one must wonder how these elaborate schemes actually continue to thrill the viewer. Everything seems to just be available for Jigsaw/Amanda to make a ultra scene, like the Judge pig trap, where somehow a whole bunch of pig liquid is just...available and ready. It doesn't make sense. Also, although Jigsaw is still written great as a character, the lines of wisdom and ""life is precious"" get repetitive and annoying. Overall, although there are still scenes that will make you cringe, such as a brain surgery scene, heads exploding, or rib cages being pulled open, this movie is just a shadow of what once was a thoughtful franchise, and the premise of a million mediocre movies to come."
"gigan-92","4","2","4","8 November 2010"," The film is basically for those aroused by gore
","Well, as in most horror franchises, we have an awesome start, a crummy sequel, but those writers and producers just keep on pushing! The story is ridiculous and rather horrendous. Predictable, I wouldn't say that, just, really, really, REALLY, dumb. Jigsaw is on his death bed in this one yet he keeps on coming up with these nifty little traps and what not. Oh yeah, and an unlimited number of warehouses, and an unlimited bank account to buy all these damn things and Amanda is so loyal you'd swear Jigsaw was actually paying her some of this money. And finally, the guy seems near omnipotent. The only thing he somehow did not predict was Amanda killing off the survivors, convenient right? Do yourself a favor and watch ""Funny Games"" and treat yourself to something truly diverse. Far from a true horror, mystery, or thriller, let alone a real film for that matter, The film is basically for those aroused by gore. It simply has nothing else to offer."

","Oh dear.<br/><br/>Firstly, I thought Saw to be a fantastic film. I'm not a fan of films who boast about torturing people, but the violence in Saw was kept to a minimum considering the circumstances - finally, a horror director who substituted blood and guts for a gripping storyline. The flashback story-telling device worked nicely, it was wonderfully written, and had a fantastic conclusion - one of the best I have seen. I then found Saw II to be a creditable film. It was totally different to the first instalment, and despite being much more violent, was also quite well written. Despite Jigsaw's traps edging towards the realms of total absurdity, the film overall was entertaining - and in these times I think its about as good a sequel as your going to get, especially for a serial killer idea such as this. Despite number 2's merits, I still wish they had just left it after the first one. But due to their ongoing success, they just couldn't let it go.<br/><br/>It seems Darren Lynn Bousman is contempt that if he thrusts a load of graphic violence in your face, he doesn't need a good script. Saw III opens with 20 minutes of torture scenes which are quite unnecessary. In the first 2 instalments, references to Jigsaw's previous traps were brief, and made for effective scenes. For the traps in Saw III, the makers have obviously ran out of ideas. They are now ridiculously unfair, and are totally stupid. How rich is Jigsaw? To get all these traps (and places to put them) he must be a multi-millionaire. The writers seem contempt to think about clever traps, and then ignore the plausibility of them. The only problem is - they aren't clever either. Traps now include getting drowned in pig juice. That's all I have to say on the matter.<br/><br/>The story contained some pretty stupid things. Despite their constant claiming that Jigsaw has good motives, he now has moved on to torturing innocent people. Most of the people he also targets to torture in this film, is basically for doing their job well. For instance, a homicide detective is targeted because she spends her time trying to figure out how people died - baffling stuff. Also, they try to make us sympathise with Jigsaw, with a scene with his presumably ex-wife. What the hell, the man is a sicko. That's the whole premise of his character. Don't try and make him human. Why must people try and ruin the most wonderful film villains? There are also numerous flashbacks to the previous films, which are just annoying, and proves the writers' have nothing fresh to add to the franchise.<br/><br/>To top the film off, they've once again they've gone for a twist ending - but this time they have 2. Saw's ending was superb, and Saw II's was acceptable, but both twists here were totally awful, and made no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>One final criticism. The lighting. Okay, it's not a happy film, but a bit of light here and there wouldn't hurt would it. There is a scene between a ""protagonist"" and his kid in his house, and the place was shrouded in darkness. What the hell, you put the lights on at night-time.<br/><br/>I am sad to see that the Saw franchise has been influenced by Hostel it seems. They've taken away all that was good from the first film, and just turned it into a regulation horror flick that anyone could think of. Despite the fact both villains are supposedly dead, yet another sequel is about to be released. Will they ever learn? I would have given this a 4/5 if it wasn't for the dismal ending. Some of it wasn't that bad, although never enjoyable."

"view_and_review","5","2","4","8 June 2007"," Was this justice or even justifiable?
","Stupid, stupid me. There was one reason and one reason only I opted to watch ""Saw III"", and that was to see Jigsaw and his protégé die a horrible death. I mean I wanted to see them die in the most gut-wrenchingly painful way; far more painful than even the imagination of the writer of this movie could come up with. Well, whereas they were killed (I think) they died far too humanely and in no way was justice served.<br/><br/>""Saw"" being successful is the equivalent to the decline of humanity as we know it. Is it too much to ask for the sick, sadistic, criminally insane, megalamaniacal killer and his female pit bull to be erased from the face of the planet in the most vicious manner? What world do we live in where such murderers are not only allowed to escape the law time and time again, but they are allowed to continue to maliciously murder time and time again as well. At least in the movie ""Seven"", in which you had an equally freakishly sadistic killer, he was killed in the end (however humanely it was).<br/><br/>I already knew going in that innocent people were going to be killed. And by innocent, I mean those who haven't really committed a grave offense, or an offense that they haven't already been punished for or should be forgiven for. But, I was willing to sit through a couple, or even a few pointless and egregiously graphic death traps just to see the ultimate demise of Jigsaw and Mrs. Jigsaw. And though they did meet their end, I am still wholly unsatisfied. Why? Because 1.) Every single unwilling participant in Saw III died because of the ""I-will-make-you-see-the-light"" king of the castle Jigsaw, or as I like to call him: the Devil. And 2.) they sheepishly left the door wide open for a part four. Part four will only mean more meaningless killing, of which the only ones who will watch are those like me who want to see the bad guy get his just deserts, or those unlike me who revel in blood, gore, and the sacrifice of innocent victims.<br/><br/>And what disgusted me even more than even the brutal deaths was the lame justification Jigsaw continued to give and his sincere assertion that he was in fact not a murderer. Um, OK... and fire is not hot, fat meat isn't greasy, and water isn't wet. That brain tumor squeezed his brain so tight that his moral compass went haywire. Whatever universe or astral plane Jigsaw is from where up is down and down is up, lets pray that no more of his kind emerge and find there way to civilization. Or let us pray that should another Jigsaw rise from the fiery pits of Hell, he or she lands in an area where the deaths of numerous people is investigated better, and such killers are captured before scores of people are decapitated, dismembered, or otherwise sent to a painful death.<br/><br/>I just want to know: what kind of mind even thinks of such movies as ""Saw""? I mean, how twisted, demented, and certifiably insane does one have to be to come up with these horrific ""games"" and traps? I'll take a Jason, Freddy, or Michael any day over Jigsaw. At least they keep their slashing limited to sex starved teenagers and they resign themselves to desolate and largely uninhabited areas. Without a doubt, the writers and directors of the ""Saw"" series of movies... no, everyone to do with the production of the ""Saw"" series should immediately have a psyche exam and serious thought should go into whether or not they should be admitted to the looney bin. <br/><br/>To sum it all up, I was completely and totally disappointed. In the end only the sick and twisted justice of Jigsaw was served, and evil reigned supreme. Now excuse me while I go throw up."
"wolf_rahm","4","2","4","14 February 2007"," Snuff film
","It's been a while since I saw this movie, and I have given it a lot of thought since. I couldn't feel anything but disgust at the end of the movie, and something tells me that is not a good sign for someone who can take a lot without being offended. Some of the teen girls who were there were almost crying, perhaps because they felt they had to endure it, just as I did. Why did I not walk out? Because I expected that there might be a lot of gore in the beginning, and then some twist and a little purpose, but when I wiped the blood from my face, the scrolling credits were on. As someone else mentioned, Jigsaw is not the villain of this movie, the ones who made it are. They made a movie to satisfy a psychotic audience. I feel so ashamed to be counted in this group. I was there, but I wish that I wasn't, because I didn't enjoy it at all. It's a snuff flick, no doubt about that. They abandoned all elements of horror and suspense in exchange for visual gore. Saw 1 was excellent, and Saw 2 was pretty good too. But Saw 3 was just a void trap that took my soul!! This will probably be the last Saw movie too. Maybe they felt that they could cross the line this time, because there wasn't going to be a number 4, and people would rush in anyway, because #1 and #2 were good. Damn it.. don't watch this movie if you still have the chance and still have some human dignity. I'd rather watch terrorists decapitate hostages (although I'd never watch that)."

This movie only shows flashes of scenes rather than showing actual scenes in continuous motion. Even though after being Saw III, they story didn't end after all. I would suggest viewers to see some comedy movie right after watching it. I was sick to the stomach after watching it. Since IMDb requires me to display at least 10 lines of comments to describe the movie's sickness I will utilize that opportunity to do so. The movie starts as usual as you would have seen in other versions of Saw. In this particular sequel every scene tries to clarifies the previous versions. Every victim is lied about the promise of the game, therefore every victim dies."

I am not one to shy away from gore and blood,I mean after the first two one must enjoy that kind of entertainment, right? but the murder scenes lacked the originality of the first 2, they were just gore, and prolonged and a waste of screen time. I felt ""nothing"" towards any character and could have cared less when they were killed. The movie lacks the emotional depth,cleverness and horror that we came to appreciate in SAW-1-2. The movie was erratic and I was NEVER scared or amused, horrified, or engrossed. I admit I know nothing about the director of 1&2 but I can't believe it is the same one here, SOMETHING is different. I believe the movie is worth renting, but be prepared to be let down. The movie ends with the idea of a 4th firmly in place..let us hope that they go back to the teams behind 1&2."

What I ended up sitting through was a pointless mean-spirited and disgusting to watch film.<br/><br/>I enjoy horror films normally and gore is not normally a problem with me, however this film just seemed to throw everything it could in terms of sickening images at the screen and then along toddles the story long afterwards.<br/><br/>On a positive light the acting was OK and it did look well put together during the scenes that where not so dark you couldn't see anything. Then there was the ending which although quite obvious from early on in the film they then insult me by doing flashbacks of everything that I have just watched like I couldn't have worked it out.<br/><br/>Since my friend is a fan of this series I shall probably end up seeing a fourth if they make it, and the tacked on feeling end of the third seems to indicate there might be one, however I hope they remember that story is more important than gore (doubt it as the core audience now will expect ever sickening traps) and that they do not try and get round the ending of this one and bring certain characters back.<br/><br/>Film makers need to remember that horror does not equal gore, this series has gone from an interesting little thriller with the first film into some sub-par slasher series that is as bad as some of the horror sequels of the 80's."

","In 2004 the world was treated to Saw. Saw was a brutal horror flick with excellent gore, a thrilling story and a superb plot - it combined the absolute best of a lot of things and with that became a new standard. Not too much later the follow up came - and that sequel confirmed the myth that some sequels can withstand the comparison with the original. Saw II was in my eyes just as good as the first one. Now... In 2006, Saw III sees the cinemas. Does it withstand the comparison? IMO, no. Not by a long shot.<br/><br/>The premise to the story stays the same: a criminal going by the handle Jigsaw puts people that deserve a lesson in his eyes to a test. The setup for the film is the same as well - lots of (excellent) gore, fear and agony burning on the screen. The background story is different. The plot attempts to make the film fit in by adding tie-ins to the other parts and succeeds to a certain level, yet it fails pretty hard as it makes a number of jumps that just don't make any sense at all. It also misses the one thing that made the previous two films twist and turn - a severe twist of plot in the end that made them unpredictable. This film is very predictable.<br/><br/>I guess it will now draw to a conclusion in a fourth part, but I can't say I am really looking forward to seeing it - it can only mean further downfall.<br/><br/>5 out of 10 mutilated victims"

I personally think Saw 2 is the best in all three movies. The ending surprised me the most. The traps are original and shocking, especially the trap for the detective, which is his own son. In the third one, traps are stupid, especially the pig trap. The ending is expectable and worst of all, Jigsaw died. The only thing that is good is it explained the riddles in the first two movies.

","This movie is a perfect example of the demise of America's culture. This movie is nothing but a meaningless bloodbath. The Main character, Jigsaw is a mad man who on his deathbed dictates brutal, cruel, tests on victims he has chosen to try and show them the importance of life. This however merely is an excuse to make America's thirst for blood and guts seem somewhat meaningful. Im not a squeamish person and I don't freak out when I see blood, but all of the blood in this movie was pointless. I wasn't the only person to leave that theater with that opinion. Trust me if you don't have a need to watch people suffer for no reason, don't bother watching this movie."

","A bit disappointing, and the weakest of the trilogy for me. I'm not usually bothered by gore, if it has a stylistic or narrative reason for being in the film, but some of the stuff in this film seemed there just to gross out the audience (like the brain surgery). The devices weren't as interesting this time around, mostly because they had no way to get out of them (though I guess that was the point). The beginning felt very choppy, and didn't flow well into the rest of the film. It seemed to be there just to resolve the stuff from the last film. The main story was alright, the twist wasn't as shocking as I thought it would be - I knew how it was all gonna play out once all the characters were introduced. The relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda was intriguing, though I would've like some more flashbacks into the behind-the-scenes stuff of the first two films. Pretty intense at times, but not as well-written as the first two. The very end was killer (pun intended), but not really logical. All in all, it was okay, but not great."

","I am a huge fan of the Saw movies, so naturally when the third came out I was very excited. I must admit that I had my doubts of the creators being able to pull off a third. In making a third, it would definitely be compared to the first two. When I watched the second one I thought to myself, ""Wow, its just as genius as the first!"" When I went to watch the third I was very pleased to see that it had explained a lot of the questions that have come up in conversations I've had with friends. So, if you questions Saw's techniques or 'okay, how the hell did the old man pull that one off"" or things to that effect, this movie really ties it all up and makes all the connections for you. Once again, they created an awesomely entertaining movie that makes you think while you cringe."

Who would have thought that both the First and even the Second Saw films could be outdone? I'm pretty sure no one could. I would like to start of by saying the gore was way more than I expected. The traps featured (I'll be it a little complex to be figured out and built by one single person, seeing as Jigsaw is bedridden) where masterpieces, in a twisted way. I'll have to admit I looked away at times because of how gruesome some of the deaths where. In terms of plot, this film took a new approach yet again to wow audiences. Trying to keep this comment spoiler free is very difficult, because even the simplest thing could possibly give the ending away. Whis leads me to my last point, prepare yourself for another extraordinary ending...I for one didn't see it coming.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie I say, screw any other movie you had in mind to see, and catch the late night showing of Saw III.

Honestly, I really did think it was clever how they set up these two stories together. I had no idea Amanda would die.<br/><br/>It really did make sense within the context of the story. I also appreciated how they really did raise a lot of moral questions that Jeff was going through. Yes, it's very gory and graphic, but I honestly think there was more to it than meets the eye.

","SAW III begins in a super-grisly fashion that sets the path for extreme gore, with a trio of extraordinarily unpleasant incidents. The first sees a virtual reprise of the gag from the original SAW flick – a guy wakes up with his leg chained to a post, and there's a hacksaw to hand. However, in a novel twist, this guy sees fit to get a porcelain slab and proceed to SMASH his foot out of shape until he can twist it through the manacle. Soon after, there's a Native American guy who has to pull a series of hooks out of his flesh before a bomb goes off, and this is indeed the most sadistic, unrepentantly grisly moment in the entire movie – anybody who watches without flinching must be emotionally dead. The final incident sees a woman having to put her hand inside a jar of acid to get a key to unlock the bomb that's wired to her rib cage. It all goes wrong, and her chest is gruesomely torn off. Had enough yet? <br/><br/>After this barnstorming opening, things slacken off for a derivative storyline about a sick killer and the doctor who's got to keep him alive – or she dies. There's none of the gore that we saw in the first ten minutes, instead the film becomes largely uninteresting, let down by too many scenes of cod psychology and lots of flashbacks to events in the previous films that don't serve to go anywhere – incidents in the previous movies didn't really need to be fleshed out because they were self explanatory. The film also reveals why Shawnee Smith never really became a star after appearing in 1988's THE BLOB – it's because she's not a very good actress, and her wide-eyed expressions of shock and her mumbling do not amount to convincing acting.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Tobin Bell is self-assured and gives an entertaining performance as the fiendish killer, and Iranian newcomer Bahar Soomekh is great as a leading victim. But Angus Macfadyen's world-weary cop is boring, his grief unbelievable, and there's not a shred of sympathy for him as the story unfolds. Of course, there's a series of weird deaths, this time including a gratuitous naked girl – you won't believe how many shots we get of her naked body – and a bout of unpleasantness involving some rotted pig carcasses which tries to get the viewer spewing. The ""rack"" is probably the second worst torture in the film – a black guy has his arms, legs, and finally head twisted out of their sockets – but by this time the viewer has become jaded to the bloodshed – it's not as effective as in the film HOSTEL, in which the brief glimpses of torture made them all the more disturbing. Things culminate with some brain surgery (you'll see worse in CASUALTY) and some yawn-inducing ""twists"" which pave the way for yet another sequel. So SAW III is okay if you're looking for gore, but offers little else to entertain."

She was annoying and confusing and really didn't live up to Jigsaw's far superior actor. However, she only contributed partly to the problem with this movie.<br/><br/>The protagonist guy was incredibly frustrating to watch. I know he was in mourning and everything, but seriously!!! He could literally save every person from the traps, but didn't. What made him more annoying was that with every person he could save, he was indecisive until the last moment, when he decided to save them, and he's too late. Frustrating. Just because he can't make an obvious decision, people suffer brutal deaths.<br/><br/>Other problems I'd like to note: the surgery scene was far too gratuitous. Should've been removed. Also, I didn't like how Jigsaw got angry. He's always incredibly calm and under control. Why did the writers make him crack? <br/><br/>Overall, if you enjoyed the first two movies, you should give this a watch, but don't expect much."

","Saw and Saw II are both good horror films because they were focused on twists and thought-provoking themes related to justice and morals. Unfortunately, this has one thing and one thing only on its mind: to spill as much blood as possible. The film bounces between needless, expositional flashbacks and gore-soaked, uncomfortably nasty torture set-pieces throughout a runtime of 2 hours, which is far too long. In this one, a doctor being held hostage is forced to keep Jigsaw alive while he and his apprentice, Amanda, put an unfortunate man through an incredibly brutal test. Saw III, in fairness, is powerful at times and features surprisingly good performances from those involved. However, it's just too disgusting to satisfy. There's an entire sequence giving close-up detail of Jigsaw having head surgery. Why did we need to see that extremely gruesome sequence? Why? It's just the filmmakers exposing themselves as the immature bloodhounds that they are. This one isn't even particularly scary and is more disturbing than anything else.

","Well, Robert the Bruce is our hero, Donnie Wahlberg escapes...kind of, Amanda goes even more bug eyes crazy and Jigsaw buys the farm in this third Saw movie, that is vast improvement over the second installment and benefits even more from the viewer not thinking too hard about what's happening.<br/><br/>We begin with Detective Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg), showing considerably more intelligence than Doctor ""I'm-going-to-saw-my-foot-off-with-a-hacksaw"" Gordon from the original, breaking his foot in order to get it out of the chain that's holding him. He limps down the hallway and... into oblivion apparently because the film fast forwards six months and not a soul has seen him in that time (this is explained in the next film).<br/><br/>Jigsaw has returned and he would appear to have changed his method and is now setting unwinnable traps to torture people to their inevitable demise. For instance, some poor unfortunate has to pull out chains that are attached to his body in order to escape a bomb, but even if he had got the chains loose, the door was welded shut. At the crime scene we get reacquainted with Matthews' former partner Detective Allison Kerry who is inspecting the crime scene with her new partner Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor of Picket Fences ""fame""). We feel kind of sorry for Kerry as mopes around all depressed about Matthews' disappearance. I wonder if the story will give us more insight into this interesting character who's been around since the first film of the series? Of course not! She gets abducted from her house and gets killed by another unwinnable trap, having her rib cage torn off after burning her hand in acid. We find out it's Amanda (Shawnee Smith) who's setting these unwinnable traps and...Good Lord. I'm already three paragraphs in. Better wind this up.<br/><br/>OK, a doctor, Lynn Denlon, who has marriage issues revealed in a conversation with a man who ""wants a divorce,"" is abducted from the hospital and wakes up with a bomb strapped to a collar on her neck that's going to blow up if Jigsaw dies before another victim finishes their test. The other victim is Jeff, a man who lost his son in a drink driving accident 3 years ago and became bitter and damaged, leading to him neglecting his daughter and all but leaving his wife. Jeff is going to have to learn to forgive as part of his test and at the end he will meet ""the man responsible for the death of his child."" So Jeff has to forgive a silent witness who never came forward at the trial of the drunk driver (try not to think about how stupid that is, unless Jigsaw is either telepathic or God), the judge who let the driver off lightly, and of course the driver himself. His results are mixed to say the least, but he does take the opportunity to forgive the driver. Mission accomplished I guess.<br/><br/>In the meantime Amanda is acting more and more crazy as Lynn struggles to keep Jigsaw alive. Then we get two twists. Firstly Lynn is Jeff's wife, the man at the start who ""wanted a divorce"" was her lover. Secondly, this is also Amanda's test. He wanted to see if she was willing to let people live, which she isn't as she first refuses to take the collar off Lynn and then shoots her, just as Jeff comes in, who takes out Amanda with one bullet. Then we get another twist as Jeff, remembering that this movie is called saw, slices Jigsaw's throat with a power saw, killing him, but not before he plays one last game from his little tape recorder. Remember how Jigsaw told Jeff he would ""meet the man responsible for the death of his child?"" Well he wasn't talking about the drunk driver who ran over his son, he was talking about himself and the fact he had kidnapped Jeff's daughter and was the only person who knew where she was. Good one Jeff. You can forgive the man who killed your son, but you can't stop yourself from slicing the throat of a dying man and now your daughter's going to die. As Jigsaw dies, the collar on Lynn's neck detonates, and Jeff's left to freak out just like Adam and Matthews in the first two films as credits role.<br/><br/>Of all the Saw movies, this probably has the victim I sympathize with the most in Jeff (Braveheart's Angus McFayden). Jeff is probably the best realized character in the whole Saw series apart from Jigsaw himself. I also for the first time was able to somewhat buy into Jigsaw's method. Jeff is being taught a positive lesson. For the first time I wonder of maybe Jigsaw is more than a crazy wannabe zen master who gets kicks out of torturing people to death and uses the delusion he's teaching people life lessons to justify it. However, that good will is lost at film's end. The last 5 minutes seriously just kills it. The guy learns nothing. Jigsaw is a very bad teacher with a very ineffective method.<br/><br/>Saw 3 is a relatively satisfying film, and, in spite of all the threads left hanging, comes the closest of the sequels to standing up as a film in its own right. This was the last installment still involving the original creative team of Wan and Whannell, and I think they were probably expecting the people they handed the ball off to, to run a lot more creatively with it than they do."

They completely ignored the concept of psycho horror and tension and went for over the top graphic violence purely for the shock value. However after about the third disembowelment it stops being shocking and becomes disgusting and repulsive.<br/><br/>One thing I neglected to mention in my earlier Saw reviews is the soundtrack. The music throughout is fairly generic horror background music, but the theme that plays during the big revelation at the end is impressive and combined with crisp editing it ensures a powerful hair raising moment of realization at each film's climax. By the third movie I found myself looking forward to this scene.<br/><br/>The acting suffers from the same problem as number two. Jigsaw and his apprentice are really good, but the other characters are shallow and unrelatable. Whether the fault lies in the script or the acting or both, I found myself bored of the secondary drama as well as disgusted by the graphic nature of the film.<br/><br/>Saw 3 is definitively the weakest so far, not that you can expect something different from a second horror sequel. There is almost no tension and a superfluous amount of blood and gore. In my opinion it is worth enduring for the twist at the end, but unless you have a strong stomach and/or are a fan of the series I recommend you skip this one."

","Third installment, easily inferior to the first two, is a massacre--literally and metaphorically. John Kramer (Bell), now on his death bed, is having second thoughts about his apprentice Amanda (Smith). Despite his pain and weakness, he still has one more test to give as Jigsaw. If you look closely, you know this isn't the last installment. One of the film's biggest weaknesses is that the story arcs as if it's concluding, a completely unnecessary action since just by watching the film you know it's not ""the final chapter"". Bahar Soomekh wins the title for the worst acting of the series. The film can sort of be commended as one of the most ruthless of the franchise, but still weak in comparison to some of the films that followed and definitely the ones the preceded.<br/><br/>** (out of four)"

","I noticed something really weird in this one. In the scene of the angel trap where that chick has the hooks attached to her rib cage, that in itself kind of proves that you need a lot of experience in the medical field to do that. So jigsaw is obviously incapable to move, let alone put hooks into someone's ribcage and amanda, well that pretty much explains itself. And all that medicine and stuff for jigsaw, you can't get that at any CVS. So like I said in my review from the second movie and this review, I think it's safe to say that Dr. Gordon is still alive. And if he isn't well, that could pretty much fail the entire saw franchise."

","As I have said before, I am not a big fan of chop horror... There are very few exceptions. The Saw series is just brilliant for its genre, because the ""bad guy"" is completely opposite the expected norm. He's a dying man who doesn't ""directly"" kill anyone, but is so brilliant that he knows how to manipulate people into killing others by not sacrificing themselves. He is, of course, a murderer in any court of law, but he doesn't think of himself as one. He says he despises murderers. That is what is smart about this franchise, because the character of JigSaw is not unlike some psychopathic murderers in the real world, who do not see that they are really doing anything wrong. In contrast they may even see themselves as doing something very right.<br/><br/>This unconventional series continues to engage in suspenseful plot twists that keep you wondering what JigSaw has up his other sleeve.<br/><br/>As for the posters, which are intended to attract people into the theater? GASP. I did not watch Saw II and III at the theater precisely because I thought the poster was revolting and I have no interest in torture-fests (ala Hostel, which was dreadful). Gosh, you'd think I didn't have to say that torture is not entertainment, but I guess for some people it is. It's not the torture that is good about Saw III, it's the plot twisting and the character of JigSaw himself. But except for the first one, I managed to catch up on the series on DVD."
"happyendingrocks","6","0","0","28 June 2009"," The pieces still fit, but the puzzle isn't much fun
","Horror fans are sort of trained to accept sequels that are largely unnecessary rehashes of elements that worked well when they were fresh. However, after Saw II proved to be such a promising follow-up, one couldn't help but hope that the third installment would prove equally solid. What we're offered here isn't necessarily terrible, but the third film in the still-burgeoning Saw saga shows the franchise laboring a bit.<br/><br/>While the ""games"" in the first two films were certainly absurdly complicated enough to force a suspension of disbelief, the sprawling devices found in Saw III are complex to the point of ridiculousness. We're inclined to accept that Jigsaw is a master of such deadly tools, but knowing here that his ""apprentice"" is the one doing the handiwork, its a bit harder to reconcile these extravagant finished products with Shawnee Smith's novice hands.<br/><br/>Smith revises her character from the first two Saw films, and, in fact, this outing picks up almost the moment the last one left off. This bodes well off the bat, since the excellent Part II gave us plenty of likable characters we'd be willing to root for through more Saw installments. Unfortunately, they mostly appear in Saw III to be killed off one by one for no apparent reason. A teeth-gritting opening with returner Donnie Wahlberg goes unfulfilled when we find out later in the film what actually happened to him in the moments after we first see him. Likewise, seeing other characters that gave Jigsaw an adversarial foil in Saw II being excised from the proceedings simply to fill out the bloated running time with senseless (but admittedly grotesque) splatter set-pieces squanders some potentially strong future story lines.<br/><br/>The ending of Saw II was dodgy enough, but there was promise that this sequel could develop the puzzling scenario given to us at the end of the previous film. After this whole convoluted maze plays out, we're pretty much left with the conclusion that everything we've seen in Saw II and III was all for nil. The way things are wrapped up, it almost seems like the film-makers intended to make number three the finish of the series, as the ultimate finale here ties a bow on the trilogy. Of course we know now, with Saw VI slated to hit theaters in October 2009 and more sequels likely to follow for as long as the franchise stays profitable, this film isn't even the halfway point of this opus. Given how strapped for crisp ideas the film-makers are here, it may be a long and dreadful ride until we get to the end of this line.<br/><br/>The gore on display here is truly sickening and zealous, so stomachs will likely be tested while taking all of this in. However, the scraps thrown to splatter aficionados here are too overblown to have much impact. Sure, there's tons of blood, and plenty of intestines and acid-washed flesh throughout, but it all seems like overkill, as if the film-makers knew they had a rickety offering here and followed the mantra of ""more blood"" to try and make this sequel live up to its namesake. The intricacy of the traps and gadgets used to inflict the carnage here is simply too dense to have any real-life grounding. While the first two films were brutal but ultimately semi-realistic, Saw III drifts well into the realms of fantasy. Even if you can accept the mechanical improbabilities of these instruments of death, after one scene where a doctor performs cranial surgery on Jigsaw with a power-drill, an ""oh, come on, now!"" response is the only course of action.<br/><br/>Ditto with the ""twist"" ending, which is actually like five twist endings in one, none of which have any lasting impact, and at least two of them are pretty stupid when you get right down to it. By the time this Cyclopean web of plot turns unfolds, we've already been invested for two hours, so it's rather frustrating to be anticipating some sort of conclusion, but find only muddy questions that we don't really care about having answers to instead. Two hours is too long for a sequel this derivative, and there's a lot that could have been trimmed here. Blood-feasts shouldn't be laborious.<br/><br/>By the end of this film, we have jettisoned almost all of the characters the franchise was starting to become built on, which means the series producers have a fairly clean slate for Saw IV. Despite the obvious weaknesses, there's plenty here to merit the interest of fans of the first two, and the veins haven't run so dry that the series can get back on track with some fresh blood for the next outing, so I'm not ready to give up on Saw just yet.<br/><br/>Any franchise has its weaker chapters, and time will tell whether or not this was a rare misstep, or the start of Saw's downward spiral into direct-to-DVD redundancy. Either way, Saw III has plenty of blood and guts, but no heart."

","There is a common phrase throughout the third edition of the Saw series, namely: 'face your fears'; perhaps a sly nod to the audience themselves as they go through this ordeal of watching someone else go through a further ordeal - psychologically as well as physically. You have to hand it to the people that make this stuff; the marketing is disturbingly effective. Initially, we were 'dared' to see Saw and Saw II. Maybe we did, maybe we didn't. Now, we have 'face your fears' pasted over most walls and doors in the film as the beginning of a new 'test' is established to about to happen and we inhale, grab hold of something and get ready for the next gross-out/squirm-in-your-seat moment. They've roped us in via the dare to see the first two, now we cannot help ourselves.<br/><br/>The third Saw film was not the disaster I was expecting, in fact it actually attempts to flesh out a character and, for the first time, presents us with a delicate protagonist at the film's core who is given the chance to essentially 'play God' with some previously set up traps. What the film wants us to think he undergoes in the long run is a transformation from vengeful, depressed individual to a man forced to come to terms with his emotions; forced to forgive those responsible for his prior feelings and undergo some sort of journey of redemption. But that's not what anyone is watching a Saw film for, that's for sure. The ideas are there, and they're developed in a certain regard but the film is clearly more interested in the blood; the gore and these traps that the screenwriters and producers, in some manner or another, manage to dream up.<br/><br/>The man undergoing the ordeal is Jeff (Macfadyen), a man whose son was killed in a hit and run accident in which the 'guilty' parties involved were the driver himself, whom got a very short jail sentence; the judge that gave him that short sentence; the onlookers that saw the incident but ran off and the doctors that couldn't actually save the boy. Each of them are rendered helpless in a series of audacious traps that tap into: medieval torture; the sensation of drowning; the sensation of freezing to death as well as out and out decisions based on whether you can find it within yourself to execute a man. Some are more gruesome than others, and after each trap before venturing into the next, Jeff seems to remove a layer of clothing such as a jacket or a cover or something; perhaps a shedding of a persona or a 'skin' as the film progresses.<br/><br/>But again, no one's come to notice those sorts of things. The film's immediate beginning sees a hapless individual hooked up to several chains, but a preceding scene is set in the dungeon he is trapped as the police investigate several dismembered pieces of flesh following a small explosion. The cutting to the chained up prisoner trying to escape is a futile exercise as we already know what's to come and this is just an excuse to show us some of the material that gives Saw its reputation as this senseless; mindless passage of traps, horror and blood. Following this, a female law enforcer is snatched for merely doing her job and is 'punished' for love of her work through a device linked to her ribcage – it's as nasty as it sounds, but it's completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>Mercifully, and I do mean mercifully, the film ditches this short passage of play and actually gives us a narrative plus protagonist to latch onto, he being Jeff and the series of scenarios he finds himself in. On a strand happening parallel to Jeff's crusade, Jigsaw (Bell) himself must rely on assistant Amanda (Smith) and nurse Lynn Denlon (Soomekh) to see him through some gut-wrenching scenes of brain surgery as Lynn is charged with performing a life saving operation – the catch is if he dies, an explosive collar attached to Lynn's neck will go off thus killing her.<br/><br/>As a lead character, it's easy to connect with Jeff. He's given a meek amount of pre-crusade build-up as we see him dejected and vulnerable in his suburban house, dressed in some pyjamas. It's all rather manipulative, but in Jeff we have a very specific reason to engage in the text and will someone through the film rather than just sit back and observe people we don't really know that well, quite possibly getting cut up. Saw III will no doubt appeal to those that are fans of the franchise; much in the same way Episode Three of the Star Wars franchise might or recent prequel Hannibal Rising might to fans of those respective franchises. This is due to said films' attempts at the deconstructing of the villain and Saw III looks to further Jigsaw's deconstruction that began in Saw II. It attempts to humanise its chief antagonist – the reason so many nasty things happen to so many 'bad' people. In this regard, it succeeds but like mentioned examples, only on a very, very basic level.<br/><br/>I think it would be too harsh to say Saw III 'masquarades' as a study of morality, redemption and forgiveness, but it is this sort of study 'dressed up' around a lot of gore and dismemberment. Fanatics will enjoy the traps and the horror of it all; those such as myself whom view it with a neutral eye might get a kick out of the study plus twists and those specifically out to hate it won't take to it at all. But the most interesting thing about the film, for me, was that amidst all this gore and all this blood, the most distressing scene involves an oven, some raw emotion and a few stuffed toys combining to make something that's a bit gruesome for very different reasons."

","It goes like this, either you somehow go for the Saw series' lot of super-duper camera tricks, its ever-so intricate plots and killing schemes, and the whole ""game""-ness of how the Jigsaw killer goes about his schemes and how the filmmakers create these bags of horror-movie gimmicks, or you don't. I don't. It's that simple. But somehow, even after watching and finding the first Saw movie to be one of the most idiotic horror movie clap-traps of the decade, I got drawn into this third part of the series (a friend filled in whatever convoluted gaps there were to fill, or whatever wasn't too damn confusing with the myriad of flashbacks, from part 2) just to see how stupid it could possibly get. This is a film directed at best with some professionalism and at worst like an epileptic marsupial who doesn't know how to let go of the color filters and the ""SO SCARY"" editing touches like flashes and quick cuts that are more likely to make us go into seizure than frighten us.<br/><br/>Let's face facts too, Jigsaw's entire plot here is about the most hackneyed ideal of redemption that can be possible in modern movies. He kidnaps a man and his wife (who, of course, happen to have a dysfunctional relationship) or other, places them in a mousetrap-style maze of hazards and booby-traps and notes left with guns and gigantic limb-twisting thingamabobs, and then big choices have to be made like if to save a man's life it's worth getting shot in the head by a trigger hooked up to a switch. Or something. There's also a brain tumor subplot with Jigsaw, as he has one and has his assistant or daughter or whatever drill into his head to remove it. <br/><br/>In short, there are a lot of things that happen in Saw III, and they all amount to material that, more or less, appears like the image provided by a scene where a 'victim' is tied and sprayed by an onslaught of shredded hogs. How much of this can we take? Basically, the big problem this time around is not so much that all of the acting is terrible (though a lot of it is like from Shawnee Smith, even a somewhat skillful actor like Tobin Bell is reduced to monologuing from one spot and dribbling silly in his seat), or that the cinematography is over-saturated and made to look like washed-out pair of hippie jeans (though it is, with some exceptions), but with its attitude. <br/><br/>This is the Saw that tries and makes us ""think"" or at least come away with seeing something that, supposedly, deals with guilt and grief and natural human flaws as if in the realm of Biblical proportional philosophy. It's all about Jigsaw making the audience, as much as the people who tortures and kills, see the error of their ways as he rots away with his lovable old brain wart... not before, of course, making sure if he goes someone's head explodes to boot.<br/><br/>It's also an excuse for a lot of irredeemable blood-letting, limb-tearing, head-blasting, and gut-churning that is just there for not much reason except for the fetishists for this kind of stuff (or, for that matter, those who appreciate it ironically, if that's possible). I wish there could be something else to this, or for that matter be scary or thought provoking. What it really is, in the end, is trash masquerading as a deep tale of revenge and other soap-opera tricks. And did I mention the flashbacks, like every other minute, taking up almost more than half of the running time? Couldn't they even get Donnie Wahlberg for more than one incredibly (unitentionally) funny scene with his torn feet beating a woman's head against a wall? Yikes against me for watching it and, hopefully, yikes against you too."

","Saw II, while good, lacked the odd charm of the first installment by trying to be more complex, a fact that also derived from the previously unrelated script having been adjusted to fit in the franchise mythology. Saw III, which was written by ""series"" co-creator Leigh Whannell (and based, reportedly, on an idea by the first film's director/co-writer James Wan), was meant to finish the planned trilogy in a glorious way. That didn't happen, and sadly, the only one to blame is Whannell himself, despite his best efforts (he even manages to elicit some sympathy reprising his role as Adam in a harrowing flashback).<br/><br/>This time, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) has reached the end line: his brain tumor has reduced him to near immobility, but since he still has one more game to play, he needs to stay alive for at least a few more hours. Hence his decision to have his apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith) kidnap Dr. Lynn Denlon (Sakar Boomekh), a surgeon who has to keep the killer alive while his plan is set in motion. The caveat: she has an explosive collar attached to her neck, meaning that if Jigsaw flat-lines, she dies as well. Meanwhile, Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) is still missing after being kidnapped in the previous film, and a guy named Jeff (Angus MacFadyen) has to face the toughest challenge of his life: he will cross paths with three people who were more or less directly involved in his son's death and, in pure Jigsaw tradition, he will have to choose whether to save them or not.<br/><br/>The moral question at the center of the Saw films has always been intriguing to say the least: if your life depended on it, would you sacrifice someone else? Saw III changes that format in that Jeff is in no immediate danger, but has to decide if those who are in such a situation deserve to survive. That idea is quite strong, and MacFadyen conveys the ambiguity required in those scenes with the right dose of doubt and desperation. Acting-wise, the other performances are as decent as one can expect from these movies, with Bell once again being the best of the lot, even when the role essentially demands nothing more than him lying on an operating table and explaining his view on life, death and the ""necessity"" of torture.<br/><br/>Even Bell's work, however, can't cover the weaknesses that emerge from Whannell's plotting: whereas the main storyline is, as said before, strong enough to justify the film, the flashbacks involving Wahlberg's character are nothing but a lame excuse for pointless brutality, swearing and Shawnee Smith screaming like a madman (or woman, more correctly). In fact, Smith's turn seems to have no real purpose for most of the movie (not that Amanda had any real depth previously, but that's another story). And that leads us to THE late-night conversation topic of choice when the Saw universe is involved: the final twist, which worked superbly in the first chapter, less successfully in the second and comes off as a major disappointment this time around, mainly because it contradicts Whannell's intentions - he set out to make the Saw films a complete trilogy (which is why he takes time to explain what many perceived as a plausibility error in the original movie), and yet it's obvious that his ""definitive"" epilogue was going to leave the door open for further installments. <br/><br/>As such, Saw III, while brilliantly filmed and appropriately upsetting, is the weakest link in what was meant to be a mere trilogy. There's almost a sense of cruel irony to the bit where Jigsaw, for the ""last "" time, says: ""Game over."".<br/><br/>5,5/10"

The idea is good but there is very little connection to the two previous films. Sure we see how Jigsaw and Amanda developed as characters and how they started out with the killings in the original film but that is all. And bearing in mind the third film takes off where the second on ended there is almost no link whatsoever to it.<br/><br/>At the end of the second film a dying Jigsaw is in police custody yet in the third film he has managed to escape and even more amazingly manages to survive open brain surgery whilst awake and no gen anaesthetic. He would have died of shock! Just too unrealistic for me. And for a dying man and young woman to be able to kidnap the victims and put them in the various traps is too far-fetched! The first two traps/kills had no connection to the story other than to increase the blood count. Jigsaw no longer takes a jigsaw shaped piece of flesh from his victims which is after all how he got his name. The guy in chains was doomed anyway because even if he pulled them all out the door was welded shut. And the lady in the angel trap would never have pulled those things off her ribs even if she had undone the harness. Both these go against the rules of the game as neither of them had any chance of surviving! <br/><br/>It would have been better if it was a standalone film or the sequel to the original, started with the lady doctor being kidnapped and the first two traps being incorporated later on in the film!

Saw III is about how bad emotional distress can really be. You know before seeing it that the gore will be there, so the emotional suffering was new but enjoyable none-the-less.

","Okay, so I'll admit it...Saw III does have an unbelievable amount of gore. Hard to believe Hostel has more gore than this. Well, anyway, the movie isn't bad at all. The critics just say it's bad because they're squeamish. Ever notice a lot of the positive reviews come from people who review really gory movies? What really makes all the ""Saw"" movies great is their amazing story-lines and plot twists. And Saw III is no exception. Yes, you do have to fight at times to not throw up, but the movie does exceed even with this flaw. I can't imagine of a better way to have started the film than by showing Detective Matthews break his own foot. This beginning alone is a great thrill and really pumps you up for it all. The following scenes were all shot expertly. The screenplay is great and really delivers. The film is the best it can be in my point of view and the only threequels I can think of that are better than Saw III are Halo 3 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Saw III is actually much better than most films I see. The gore can be at times unnecessary (but for short periods) and Timothy Young in the Rack was just borderline shocking, but the storyline still is great. The movie progresses quite nicely. I can also praise the camera-work. I have never really seen a lot of groundbreaking camera-work, save for Cloverfield's first person view. I really liked how the camera moved from Troy's crime scene to Kerry's house.<br/><br/>The film's strongest point is its suspense. When Jeff was reminded of his son's death by Jigsaw's puppet lying on the floor in a contorted position, I could totally feel his frustration. I can recall cringing at my seat when Judge Halden was being splattered with pig guts and asking myself if Jeff was seriously going to leave Halden to rot. Showing pictures of Jeff's deceased son Dylan before he burned all of Dylan's possessions was just a cool touch. The film had great suspense and twists.<br/><br/>The movie, unlike the original Saw, had a more crime-movie feel at points rather than an unknown killer chase on movies like Se7en. This movie and Saw II really had established a CSI-like feel with their crime scenes. And that is a good thing.<br/><br/>People call the Saw series overrated. Star Wars, Harry Potter and Back to the Future are actually movies that deserve this tag. Okay, maybe they had one or two good movies in those series that were good, but everything else was crap (you know who you are, Harry). Don't believe the nay-sayers, Saw III is a great film that is more than definitely worth a watch."

","The original Saw will be forever one of the most brilliant movies ever made, from beginning to end the first time you see it you are left in amazement. The second movie was a bit of a let down but nonetheless very entertaining to watch, but too much of a good thing is a bad thing which leaves us with....this.<br/><br/>The thing about the first 2 movies are the plot twists that ""no one sees coming"", and while the first and second movies (the first time through anyway) have that killer x-factor, by now movie fans are looking for the twists. The sad part was I wanted to love this movie, I liked it because of the gore and Tobin Bell's continuing brilliance of John/Jigsaw but I wanted to love it like the first two movies, but I couldn't.<br/><br/>Several plot ""twists"" become disappointingly clear well before they're supposed to be revealed, which ruins the suspense when you know something's coming. You can come up with the ending's twist simply by putting 2 and 2 together about the possible parents of the children.<br/><br/>The plot of it isn't that great either, a man loses his son in a car accident and must save all the people involved that did nothing about justice for the child? Least the first movie centered around a Doctor with a shady past and the second around a cop's son trapped with a bunch of people his dad locked up. The dude running around debating whether to save people or not was not really something to get behind.<br/><br/>Now lets get to the gore...Dina Meyer gets her ribcage ripped out, a woman literally freezes to death, a judge almost drowns in pig guts and someone gets turned around 180 degrees. I must say they kicked it up a notch from the first 2 movies, but more doesn't necessarily mean better. Where the hell did Jigsaw and Amanda find 100 dead pigs anyway? Unlike the first 2 movies, this movie didn't end like there would be another sequel...yet they made one anyway. I can only hope that one can be a lot better than this, because this was just too predictable.<br/><br/>The highlight of the movie has to be the ribcage thing, I thought she got it bad in Starship Troopers but this takes the cake 5 out of 10"

","The darkest and most emotional Saw movie.

"therockin_rooster","7","0","0","29 March 2008"," Perhaps a bit over done, but well done just the same
","Like a great many millions of fans, I have come to enjoy this series since being forced to watch the first film.<br/><br/>A friend of mine told me I would like the first Saw and made me watch it. I was impressed. Like the first Scream, the ending blindsides you.<br/><br/>So of course I watched the second one... I was left a little hollow there and glad I waited for it to air on HBO, but Saw III made up for my lack of enthusiasm for the second.<br/><br/>The thing I most enjoyed about the first Saw was the compelling story and fine acting. And being a true horror buff, naturally I enjoyed the blood as well. While Saw III takes the viewer to new places and the lowest of lows (""lows"" in a good way), I also think it overcompensates for the shortcomings of Saw II.<br/><br/>The story of Saw III was well written and well cast. However, they over indulge in the gore just a touch. I have little doubt that the producers took the fan's criticisms of the second film (not enough gore) and went out of their way to shove it down everyone's throat by doing everything in their power (short of taping our eyelids open) to make us watch and potentially, make us sick.<br/><br/>By which I am referring to the length of a few of the scenes in particular, they drag on and on, forcing as much gratuitous gore upon us as the MPAA would eventually allow. And don't you dare shield your eyes, you are best suited to watch due to those scenes being laced with flashbacks and important plot points... thus my reference to: taping our eyes open.<br/><br/>While it also obvious that the producers are pushing the story to a degree simply for the sake of setting us up for more sequels, the story did have a natural flow to it. Jigsaw is more defined and we are allowed to get to know him. Amid all of the violence and peril he thrusts his victims in, you can actually see his point of view and almost come to accept it.<br/><br/>Bottom line, I am a fan of the series, and although I would love to know that with every October I can count on a movie with the word ""Saw"" in the title, I hope they don't push this series too far... Because it is all to possible that Saw could fall into a trap of it's own and die a horrible-gruesome death because it couldn't head it's very own message."

","This film is both well done and somewhat sadistic - so it's hard to get excited about it. There is a lot of graphic horror. Usually, horror movies are pretty ridiculous, but this one's done well enough that it's actually hard to watch.<br/><br/>This movie picks up on the themes from the first two ""Saw"" movies: people are put into positions of having to make truly horrific choices. These usually involve a person causing a permanent self-inflicted injury in order to survive - or to allow someone else survive. This last component is prevalent in Saw III.<br/><br/>The principal cases here: a doctor is fated to save a patient ... or die with the patient, and a man is put in the position of having to save the people who were involved in his son's death.<br/><br/>There are some twists and surprises as the story unfolds. If you can make it past the first 15 minutes of the movie, you'll survive the rest. The horror is genuinely strong, the story is reasonably engaging and the acting is decently good. If you're a extreme horror fan, this is the movie of the year to see. For everyone else, it's a little too disturbing to watch."

The thrill and suspense of the games presented to us in the original Saw are now replaced with sick ideas designed to do nothing more than test you on how long to can watch without feeling squeamish. its a shame this franchise has had to turn to mindless gore to entertain it's fans. It looks like the blade on this franchise is becoming dull."
"Anonymous_Maxine","3","0","0","10 March 2008"," Yet another failed second sequel.
","It's extremely difficult to make a good ""Part 3"" in any franchise, and Saw is a perfect example. The descent in quality from parts 1 and 2 to this one is so precipitous that it makes me think of the fact that, in trilogies or otherwise, good second sequels are extremely hard to come by. Back to the Future and Alien 3 are the only two that I can think of at the moment, and there's a Saw 4.<br/><br/>It starts with the investigation of a man who had chains attached to numerous parts of his body, and he had to rip them off in order to get out of a room before a bomb exploded. One of the detectives says that that was ""all he had to do."" He gets mocked for this by another detective, since the man had to rip chains out of both of his Achilles tendons. Makes it a little hard to walk out of anywhere.<br/><br/>At any rate, before long we sit through a pointless series of scenes showing the kidnappings of various victims, ripe for the fast-forward button. By this point in any series or franchise or whatever, the formula will be getting pretty old and tired unless something new is added. There's nothing new here. It's the same old crap about this guy John Kramer somehow having the time to devise unbelievably complex torture devices and little puzzles for the victims to try to solve in order to escape.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is that by now it is getting so ridiculous to see this guy devise schemes to literally rip people to pieces while at the same time trying to criticize people for neglecting children and wives. What??? Sorry John, but the brutal tortures and murders are having the little unexpected side effect of damaging your credibility just a tiny bit.<br/><br/>In this installment, John has kidnapped a doctor and is forcing her to keep him alive. I love her introduction, by the way. She performs one of those movie operations where she does something miraculous, saves a young child's life, and everyone around her gets mad at her for it. I love that. Talk about not being appreciated. And on top of that, her marriage is falling apart. Soon she finds herself kidnapped and wearing a collar that's basically half a dozen guns pointed at her throat. Maybe my own luck isn't so bad after all. And the brilliant talent of Angus Macfadyen is totally wasted as Jeff, Dr. Denlon's (Bahar Soomekh) husband and another of Jigsaw's victims.<br/><br/>Here's the whole movie - <br/><br/>""Hello so and so, I want to play a game. The device you are wearing is attached to your whatever, in order to escape you'll have to pass a series of tests. Let the game begin. Blah blah blah blah blah""<br/><br/>If this is getting old for you, don't feel like you're missing anything if you stop watching these movies now. By this point, the Saw films are only for hardcore Saw and horror fans, the latter of which I used to consider myself but with each movie like this that comes along, the further away from the genre I feel. Remember Hostel? If that's where horror movies are going, to that level of vacuous thought and logic, I'm done, I can tell you that right now. Saw 3 is a hundred times better, but still a bad movie.<br/><br/>One of the major revelations that this sequel adds to the series is that we see an interesting setup to the original film, as well as behind the scenes of how and why some of the devices are created and Amanda's relationship to Kramer, the killer. Their relationship is ridiculous in the extreme, they just don't make a lick of sense as human beings. Not even a drug addict would get as emotionally attached to such a pasty, brutal man as this guy. Her tears before his surgery are outdone in bizarre ridiculousness only by her reaction of disgust during his surgery. Ripping that woman's rib cage apart didn't seem to bother her so much. Maybe it was the licensed physician that was worrying her. <br/><br/>Speaking of which, there is nothing dumber than people who blame doctors for their illnesses. Dr. Denlon was one of the diagnosing doctors of Kramer's ""inoperable tumor,"" so he decides to kidnap her and punish her for, I don't know, not being able to operate. Maybe if she was Superdoctor and could do an operation that no one else in the world could do he wouldn't be so upset. <br/><br/>Then again, Jeff, in anguish over his son's death by a drunk driver, allows a witness who fled out of shock and fear to freeze to death before his eyes for doing something that a good percentage of normal people would have done. She was terrified! And then he considers allowing the judge who sentenced the killer too lightly (what state gives 6 months to drunk drivers that kill kids??) to drown in rotten pig guts. Following that kind of logic, I wouldn't have been surprised if he had wanted to punish God for the irony of letting a drunk driver kill his son in the middle of a sunny day. <br/><br/>The end of the film has an unexpected level of complexity, some of which works, but also includes an unintentionally hilarious shotgun blast and a device called ""the rack"" which is truly sickening and disturbing, and not in the good horror movie kind of way. <br/><br/>The end of the series is WELL past due, yet I'm sad to see that there is a part 5 being made. I hope they can manage to get a shot of someone kicking a dead horse into the movie somewhere"

Because it's so bloody, that the German equivalent to the American MPAA (or some other state department, that I don't know the name of at this very moment) did put this one on an index list ... that means, that you can't put any advertisement of the movie in any magazine and that it can only be sold in separate shops/areas of shops, that can only be entered by adults!

","This is a difficult film to rate considering its content versus its cinematography. Let's review the latter. The plot, scenario, jigsaw build-up, imagination, creativity and filming are really excellent. Sound and camera effects are mastered as well as scene lighting. For this I would give it an 8-9. How about rating the movie with its content? It is one thing to reflect on the deepest and sadistic side of human nature while dealing with an overall story concept. This was beautifully executed with The Silence of the Lambs. But in Saw III sadistic torture becomes the centerpiece. When further listening to comments by Leigh Whannell and director Daren Lynn Bousman, it shows that both enjoyed the subject and wanted to please the viewers. That is one thing which disturbed me. Then there is the subtle perversion to show the Jigsaw in a more understandable if not positive way: he is not a murderer, in opposition to Amanda, and the rules of his game always enable the victim to escape, at the expense of great pain of course. Finally, each civilization has its wave of torture, the most bloody examples going back to the Mayas, the Spanish Inquisition and more recently the Nazis.

I think the Saw guys are just fooling people when they there is no need to see the old movie to understand the story. With people who have seen the first and second movie itself it is puzzling in a few sequences, God save those who start the franchise from SAW 3. The story is the same, saw traps a few more people, asks a few to make decisions and based on the decision makers discretion some one bleeds (hmm ... Sweet!!!). The blood is there, traps are there, unfortunate victims are there and in the end it gives a satisfactory feeling knowing JIGSAW is no more there but a bit disturbing knowing there are still people trapped (meaning more movies from the studios to cash in on the SAW craze).

","Saw III is a typical sequel: it bombs in many ways, while it has moments when it definitely rises to challenge the first installment. One thing that never felt right was all the useless gore and blood. Sometimes this movie felt like a pointless and utterly empty parade of different kind of deaths. Although some of them quite inventive and twisted, but beautifully designed, most of the time they do feel out of place. The first part's greatness came from the mental pressure and the analysis of people reacting to the difficult circumstances. The husband's role is very clear, he's but an instrument that leads from one execution to another. He's lacking any kind of personality and his character isn't going anywhere for most of the film. John is there to be there, after all, he's the main character, the doctor gets the same treatment as the husband, and Amanda is wandering about aimlessly. The only thing that saves Saw 3 is - a bit surprisingly - is its final scene. It's a glorious moment when the characters suddenly get depth, it's tragic nature overwhelming - yet unable to lessen the feeling that we've been cheated. Not bad overall, a strong piece of gory entertainment, but hardly more."

I had never seen the first 2 Saw movies and I wasn't planning on seeing this one either, but after being talked into it I was relatively sure i'd regret it.<br/><br/>Now I expected a lot of gore in this movie after hearing about it from friends, but I never could have expected just how graphic it really was. The fact that it was rare for them to cut away from a body being torn apart surprised me at first, and even though you grow to expect it, I can't see how you could ever get used to it. And although the traps weren't all that bad (maybe i'm the only one, but the woman freezing didn't gross me out too badly) there were a couple that could haunt your mind for quite some time. Such as a girl having her rib cage torn apart and a man having his limbs twisted off.<br/><br/>Now I can't speak for hardcore Saw fans, or Saw fans at all for that matter, but even though after the movie finished I promised myself I would never watch it or anything like it again, i'm already starting to want retouch on the feeling you get while watching it.

"DonFishies","7","0","0","22 March 2007"," Better than Saw II, but ultimately not satisfying enough
","I had wanted to see Saw III when it was in theatres, but never managed to get a chance to go and see it. When it came on DVD, I attempted to rent it right away, but was too busy and all the copies were always sold out. So I had to wait until now to finally get my chance. And despite the simplistic content of the film, I am still really conflicted about it more than a day after seeing it.<br/><br/>Opening with a rather bizarre string of ""character tie-ups"" (and two not-so elaborate death sequences), the actual key characters in the film are not introduced for the first fifteen minutes at least. Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is on his deathbed. So a brain surgeon, Lynn (Bahar Soomekh) is kidnapped and put into a game where she would have to keep him alive, or will end up dying with him. At the same time, Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) is being put into multiple tests to see if he can conquer his ultimate fear.<br/><br/>Simply put, Saw III is not as good as the original film, but does improve in a few areas over its disappointing predecessor. The film is focused on a small number of characters this time around, and does not make the audience try and feel for more than a half dozen like the previous film. As a result, it feels more focused when these characters are on screen, and allows for more character development. Of course, we do not hear a lot of it until the film's dying minutes (much akin to the other films), but it feels like a vast and much needed improvement.<br/><br/>The performances are also much better done here. Even though he is stuck in a bed for most of his scenes, Bell proves to be the most menacing and evil dying film character ever. All of the fear and chills he has given in the past, is all present here, and never wasted. Just looking at his sad and twisted body, now heavily dependent on oxygen, as he is introduced to Lynn, is just terrifying. Shawnee Smith, who returns as Amanda, is also very good. I did not like how emotionally twisted she was at first, but as the film goes on, her actions make a lot more sense and feel much more authentic and proper. Newbies Soomekh and Macfadyen do an adequate job in their roles, with Macfadyen really pulling in the brunt of the emotional sequences. They deliver, but are overshadowed by how good Bell and Smith are.<br/><br/>But they are also overshadowed by the fact that the movie, while being about their struggle to compete in Jigsaw's twisted games, is not about them. It serves more as a backgrounder on the events of the first two films, filling in the gaps of logic and questions that many of us have had since seeing the films. I will not ruin all of the surprises that the film reveals, but there is a lot of back story covered for both Jigsaw and Amanda. It was a nice touch to also have former game ""players"" Leigh Whannell (Adam in the first film) and Donnie Wahlberg (Detective Matthews from the second film) return for a bit of background on what happened to their characters (no Cary Elwes appearances though). Having so much historical background material though, takes away much of what is happening in the present, and makes it take a bit of a backseat in a lot of cases. These events are just nowhere near as important, and their lack of definition is felt throughout the movie, right up to the ending, which fails to deliver like the other two films as a result of this.<br/><br/>Another thing I resented was how mean-spirited and violent the film was. Yes, the previous two films had their shares of gruesome violence, but the limits are really being tested here. The death and the torture scenes just do not feel ""fun"" anymore (for lack of better terminology). What impressed us about the originality of the violent ends in the first two films, feels a lot more dull and half baked here. Yes, they are still intriguing ways to kill, but they just do not feel like they are on the same level. On the same token, the blood seems to have been anted up to help compensate for the loss. I cringed in a few sequences, and in others, I just felt like the gore was being way too overdone. It was bordering on the self-parody of Hostel for much of the film, and considering how horrendous that movie was, is not much of a complement.<br/><br/>As well, the whole scheme and meaning of the games that Jigsaw tests people with has been changed all around. What we are meant to believe in the first two films, is not the true meaning given in the third. It takes away a bit of the morality felt throughout the first two films, and just gives into the mindless excess of every other horror film being released every few weeks. What was original and unique, gave in to becoming mainstream. The deaths were characteristic, and had importance. Here, they just feel like they are being done just for the sake of it. There is no love or emotional attachment to anyone, because they are introduced and last even less time after.<br/><br/>Some people may have liked some of the liberal changes made in this film from the previous two, but I really think it took away from the mythos and emotional appeal that made the films so uniquely successful in the first place. I appreciated how much light was shed on some of the questions I had about the other two films, but on the other hand, I was not completely satisfied in the end. I just hope Saw IV is not exactly the same.<br/><br/>7/10."

","Saw 3 takes off from where we left off in saw 2, with Detective matthews trapped, chained to a pipe in that significant and almost tomb like confine of the bathroom from the first film. This then leads into another series of games, orchestrated by jigsaw, now bed ridden with cancer, and his assistant/apprentice Amanda. They kidnap a doctor and force her to perform surgery on jigsaw, to releive some of his suffering, while at the same time, a father grieving for the accidental death of his son, is put through a series of tests which will test his ideas of revenge and forgiveness. While the first Saw film was a brilliant and tense film, and Saw 2, while upping the brutality stakes was a worthy if moderate follow up, Saw 3, lacks some of the twists and tension used so brilliantly in the first two films, and proceeds to bludgeon the viewer with a round and after round of brutal and at times, gratuitous violence. Im not bothered by that and don't mind blood and gore on-screen (and will give credit for the director and writer for pushing the limits and intensity that an American r-rating would allow), yet Saw 3 bored me pretty much. Whereas the tension built up in the first film was through the idea that one of these guys would eventually use the hacksaw to cut through something other than a chain, saw 3 pummels us with, a guy breaking and snapping his own foot of, a women having her ribcage pulled open, a guy pulling rings out of his skin that have been attached there all in the first twenty minutes, followed by brain surgery with non surgical tools and a man having his legs and arms twisted. In fact it came to the point of the brain surgery scene that i almost laughed as i imagined the filmmakers with a list of what gory scenes they need to do, and ticking it off one by one. Plus the characters are not as well written, the grieving, revengeful father geoff, seems like an idiot at times, and doesn't illicit any sympathy through his own idiocy. Saw 4 will be round the corner for this halloween, all i can hope is that they focus on producing a better story with better characters, and keep the gore just don't pummel us to death with it!!"

But I saw them and was surprised, Tobin Bell's Jigsaw was even better than Hannibal Lector, and I became a huge fan. Before I saw SAW 3 I had considered the fact that it would perhaps not be as good as the other. When I saw it, I must say I was a bit disappointed, were SAW 1 had fine dialog and SAW 2 perfect dialog, SAW 3 diden't have any. SAW 3 was about Amanda's present and past, Jigsaw's last hours and a poor man in his dangerous game. Jigsaw diden't say great lines like he did in the 2. film and I diden't really like the way the story turned out to be. And the twists wasen't as surprisingly. But I have kept in mind that Saw 3 still is a must, mainly because it continues the SAW story, but also because it's still way better than all other horror movies like: ""Scream"", ""I know what you did last summer"", ""Friday the 13"" and ""Nightmare on Elm street"". So even though I don't agree with the story line, I'm still hoping that the rumors about a SAW 4 will turn out correct. It would be a shame if the best horror films ever, diden't get to at 4th installment. Hope we will See more to Tobin Bell: a great actor, and the scariest man alive."

","Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda is in control this time. Jigsaw is near his death, and thus another game begins. Throughout the movie you think the guy and the doctor are being tested and they are, but the big twist is that the movie is about Jigsaw testing Amanda! Amanda's traps are unfair in that the victim can't escape (exeption: judge character). The woman with the thing around her ribs was completely impossible, b/c there was no lock to use the key with. I thought that was kinda crappy. Anyway, I doubt that a Saw 4 will go, because nearly everyone died at the end. That is a huge disappointment! Jigsaw, Amanda, and the doctor lady all die.

","Is Jigsaw going to be another one of those maniacs - aka, Jason Vorhees or Michael Myers - who simply cannot be killed? I don't know, but he makes another appearance in Saw III, which - to me - is far more gruesome than the first two but oddly less satisfying. It starts with the opening of the movie and a couple of people caught in Jigsaw traps, sequences which seemed to serve little purpose for the movie except to make the audience squeamish right away. There were also quite a few flashbacks which ended up being a little confusing in relation to the timeline. And the ending was decidedly un-Hollywood, but so gut-churning and made me so uncomfortable (and I'm not talking about the gore, but the ultimate way the events unfolded) I'm not sure I can watch this movie again. All in all, though, it was a solid horror/suspense movie - albeit the lesser of the three Saw movies (No. 2 was probably the best one, though the ending for No. 1 was pretty darn cool).

","First of all,the words that you are about to read come from a man who's brain and heart are still shocked from the viewing of Saw III. Two hours have passed since I left the cinema, and probably my brain is still not fully functional, so please forgive my over-excitement.<br/><br/>If you have seen the first and second movies, you know what Saw is about. You know that what made it different from the usual thrillers, was that it gave a reason to the violence that it depicted.It gave a reason above the cheap excuse of a maniac serial killer,who have gone mad and started killing innocent teenagers. It gave a reason. A moral reason.It made you feel guilty,because it showed people paying for everyday sins, sometimes small sometimes big,sins that we all could have done. It showed a killer. A human,a vulnerable killer. A person that you wouldn't probably notice in your everyday life.It forced you deep inside a world,in which moral judgment prevailed. Ruled.<br/><br/>Saw III forces you even deeper. It lets you feel not only what the victims felt,but it also guided you through the complex mind of a genius killer,a man who carefully crafted punishment in ways that made it look like a tool of forgiveness,of self liberation.<br/><br/>As a thriller/splatter Saw III made a difference. It had extreme gore (unsuprisingly), but it didn't gave the viewer cheap thrills. Instead, it gave intensity. A two hour roller coaster ride,intense in almost every second of it. Also it did well by filling (almost) all the plot gaps that Saw and Saw II left behind,and it didn't lack the originality. It gave new dimensions to the tortures that Jigsaw used.And most important, it showed the sane insanity behind their real purpose.<br/><br/>Saw had the plot, Saw II had the action. Saw III combined them in the most perfect gory/scary extravaganza that we have seen in the last years. Without any doubt,I have to choose it as the best Saw movie ever.<br/><br/>SINOPSIS (Skip if you don't want to spoil the fun): A doctor gets kidnapped by jigsaw's apprentice Amanda in order to help him stay alive. But of course he doesn't miss the chance to teach her a moral lesson about the way she lives. Hard. She will be forced to help jigsaw stay alive (this way testing her will to save someone) or she will die too. Right in that moment Lynn (the doctor), will be told that there is another 'test subject' near there, who's decisions throughout his version of the game will decide her fate. As well as his of course."

","Jigsaw, who is on his deathbed, gets his apprentice Amanda to kidnap a doctor, who is told to keep him alive or she will die. Meanwhile Jeff is the next person to fall victim to Jigsaw's game.<br/><br/>When choosing to see a horror film, one should not listen to what the film critics have to say about it. Usually they will tear the film a new one, simply because they're not a fan, or appreciate the genre. Horror is a genre for its fans, not it's critics. It's no surprise that the critics hate the third Saw film, but the fans rejoice around it. While Saw III is not the best film of the trilogy, it's not the worst either. Improving over the mess of a sequel that was Saw II, Saw III tries to piece back together missing pieces in the jigsaw and succeeds at doing so...barely.<br/><br/>While many thought that Jigsaw himself died at the conclusion of the second film, we were all wrong. He's still alive and kicking, well not kicking, but alive. It's up to Lynn, a doctor to keep him alive, for her sake. She is attached to a device that will blow up is Jigsaw's heart rate stops and she leaves his proximity. Sounds very ""Battle Royalish"". She is only a small part of a much bigger game that Jigsaw is playing. In a couple rooms over another victim wakes in a wooden box, this is Jeff. He is unwillingly (like everyone else) thrown into this game of life or death. His so called crime; according to Jigsaw is his inability to let go of the past. A car killed his son and Jeff has yet to let go of this, so he is sent on this ""quest"" to get to the man who killed his son. He must choose to forgive and save three victims, who all have their hand in his son's death, or let them die. Eventually all of this somehow leads up to the films end where it throws it's expected twist, which isn't as good as either of the previous films.<br/><br/>Saw II didn't go over so well because it took a different angle, and failed. SAW III does the exact same thing, yet somehow gets away with it, by an inch mind you. What made the original so compelling and unique was that it took place in this dirty bathroom. In the sequels, it's multiple rooms. This is a double edge sword; while it's neat to want to see what crazy contraption Jigsaw has in for us behind door number one, two or three...there is no real sense of urgency, or confinement. Jeff makes his way through room-to-room trying to save the victims, which include drowning in chopped up pig stuff, being frozen to death and being twisted to death, yup I said twisted.<br/><br/>The film picks up exactly where the second film left off, you could basically splice the two films together and watch one long bloody film, no pun intended. We see Eric, the detective from the second film chained up in the same bathroom; he tries everything to escape his chains and finally comes up with an answer. No, he doesn't saw off his foot like Dr. Gordon, he smashes it with the toilet cover and then breaks it. That was the one and only squirm in my seat moment for me, as the rest if really just blood and guts. Yes, Saw III is the bloodiest of them all; You'll get foot smashing as I mentioned, heads exploding, bodies twisting, freezing, suffocating...so on. <br/><br/>SAW III uses flashbacks to show us things that we didn't know about the first two films, such as the fact the Amanda has been in on it since the whole Dr. Gordon and Adam fiasco. She even killed Adam, instead of him starving which is what we were led to believe. Still to mention of what happened to Dr. Gordon though, but I'm sure we can all agree on him dying. Ever wonder why Adam and Gordon never saw Jigsaw breathing, somewhat explained here. These flashbacks seemed like they were here just to cover up plot holes found in the first two films. Yet they work in an odd way. It makes you want to pay more attention, whenever they go back to the previous films, you want to pay attention cause you start to think you may have missed something. Some of the flashbacks may take away from the earlier films, especially with Adams death.<br/><br/>The SAW theme music is here yet again, this time with a couple tweaks. It's the new remix, still has same effect, but possibly to a lesser degree. SAW III builds up to it's ending for awhile and once it finally hits you're left sitting there asking yourself if THAT was suppose to be the films huge twist. The twist is okay in it, but doesn't even compare to the sizes of our jaws after watching the first two. More then its blood and guts, it's a story about Jigsaw and Amanda, who become humanized with their emotional connection between the two of them. She cares for him and he cares for her. <br/><br/>There were many things that were left not answered here. Like who was the blonde girl in Jigsaw's dream, or what did the letter say that he gave to Amanda, why the hell did he pour hot wax on one of the tapes? Will these be answered in number 4? <br/><br/>I don't see how they are going to manage getting another film out, but they probably will. The Saw series will always be torturing new victims as long as we still want it to. Saw III will take you back to the beginning and will please the SAW fans and fans of something bloody, but don't expect to be surprised by their so-called twist at the end, it's a real stinker."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>The third installment in the SAW series finds everyone's favorite unsolicited life guru Jigsaw struggling with his new help, Amanda. You see, Amanda, whom we see in Flashback dedicating herself completely to Jigsaw after having survived his games (from Saw I), isn't entirely in tune with Jiggy's altruistic vision. You see, she keeps setting up the games to be unwinnable. Bummer, that. Saw III is basically one really long (and bloody) employee evaluation that sadly, she fails. <br/><br/>The tricky thing about Saw III is that it's trick is less obvious. The twist is not so much a revelation as a culmination. Many people are left wondering why so much of the movie is spent dwelling on the past two episodes but if you're paying attention you'll figure this out easily. Every SAW film has told the story of the players in the game through Flashback. What at first glance appears to be ""Saw: Behind the Mayhem"" turns out to be the most important clues to why Amanda was chosen for this particular game. <br/><br/>The death traps this time out are as inspired as the first two, though probably a bit too elaborate for a deadly duo to construct. The Rack is especially stretching it (pun intended). However, the movie is smart in that it shows us that Jeff has enough time to save these unfortunate souls before that clock ticks down, but he's too focused on who these people are to keep his wits about him. <br/><br/>While the plot holes are numerous and gaping, the story keep moving briskly forward, leaving little time to dwell on the questions that afterward plague the brain. Like: How did Jigsaw know Jeff wouldn't die grabbing the key? How did he know that the other dude would? What is his plan B? <br/><br/>I think people who liked the first two movies will come around to this one eventually. It's got gore, surprises, and it's brings Amanda & Jigsaw's story to a logical conclusion."

Saw III wasn't really that good.<br/><br/>Firstly, it's hard to do these films. You need a good premise (which Saw had) and an even more elaborate plan for any sequels, which Saw II did very well in that respect, no matter how cheap the ending was. Saw III on the other hand, did nothing to liven it up.<br/><br/>The story is predictable (I figured it out pretty clearly by the second last quarter), the characters do so-so in terms of acting (no creepy intellectual conversation like in Saw II... aww), and the movie, on a whole, didn't live up to its expectations.<br/><br/>Sure there was some mild suspense and the occasional jump-out-of-your seat moment (which I'll admit, there were a few) but frankly that's about it. The traps, which is why people essentially watch these movies, were pretty lame and not powerful enough -- nothing to truly make you cringe. However, there's gore galore! The plot had a few rare good points and the ending rocked. I really hope this is the last Saw for at least these characters because it ended so fittingly.<br/><br/>All in all, any horror fans (or Saw fans) will definitely appreciate this movie, no matter how many faults it carries.

","I just came back from viewing saw III, and I must say that it is probably the most intricately woven piece of crap I've ever seen. Fortunately for my sake, I went into the movie with low expectations so I ended up being only slightly disappointed. My main problem with the film is that it makes a very tired attempt at masking it's characteristics of a snuff film by throwing in a shoddy storyline, sub-par dialogue, and a handful of excessively mediocre plot-twists. HOLY S*** SAW-PEOPLE! YOU'VE PIECED TOGETHER NOT JUST ONE, BUT SEVERAL WEAK MONTAGES OF RANDOM FLASHBACKS SUPPORTED BY THE SAME LAME MUSIC FOR EVERY SEQUENCE... unimpressed. In addition, the logical inconsistencies are beyond abundant, but the film's realism (or lack thereof) is a factor of considerably less importance in determining the value of this film. To be honest- I don't have the motivation to expose what a travesty this movie really is, because it's more than capable of proving this without my assistance. In summation, I do not regret seeing this film, because it has provided me with some much needed blog-fodder. To the reader I must say: I could care less whether or not you see the film or not, but consider yourself warned, because if you do choose to watch this train-wreck of a motion picture you'll have no one to blame but yourself for ""wasting 8 bucks"". Not since Mel's Passion of the Christ has a snuff film attempted to pass for something more. What's even more disappointing is that, through the unintentional support of viewers like myself and the intentional support of the legions of retards comprising the movie-going public, the saw enterprise will continue to discharge more cinematic dysentery for many a Halloween to come. What's even more disappointing is that it's received a collective rating of over 7 stars, am I the only one who's shocked? That's it for this review- I'm going to watch something with some redemptive values like Monty Python."

I did like the first movie because it had and interesting story and was a little more plausible than this one. Right off the bat, some random guy is crunching off his foot. Then a few minutes later is the guy in chains. I thought that Jigsaw and Amanda were too pretentious, the story twisted so many ways that it started to topple, there was little known about any of the victims which made it hard to sympathize for either side. The thing that bothered me most was the unrelenting gore. The wet, crunching, ripping, screaming was nauseating. The worst part of all was there was after sitting through all of it, there was not one thing redeeming for any of the characters (and therefore the audience).<br/><br/>Now, I have seen some weird, gross stuff and it hasn't really bothered me in the past. Hostel was a bit strong, but it was sparse with the torture when it needed to be. I enjoyed the Jackass movies, so I'm not being prudish. If you like pure, raw gore then this is your film.

Saw II (5/10) was quite a disappointment, but honestly, I didn't really expect that much, as I knew they were not going to build upon or go in a new direction with a sequel, and that it would be just a rehash of old ideas. Saw III is pretty much the same as II. Nothing new added, same old territory.<br/><br/>Although this one I found was worse that II. Mostly because half of the movie was in flashbacks, which really didn't add anything to the current plot or do much for character development of Jigsaw and his apprentice. It was just filler because the writer/director had such a weak story and didn't know what else to do.<br/><br/>Also Charlie Clouser, the composer, created an excellent piece of music at the end of Saw 1, and unfortunately he knows it, because he uses it over and over again in this film. It was great the first time, but, it gets tiring hearing it over and over again.<br/><br/>Finally, I also found the quality of acting, writing, directing, also quite shabby, when compared to the other two films.

","Having watched and loved the first then being slightly let down by no.2 it came as no surprise that the latest installment of the hugely popular Saw franchise is a real stinker! Unfortunately there will be a forth installment but if you watch number 3 until the end credits as I did, then you may ask yourself this question ""where do they go from here?"" Anyway we'll leave that up to the powers that be. <br/><br/>As for this one well the less said the better. Jigsaw is back with understudy Amanda and they're up to the usual tricks. Some poor schmuck, or in this case schmucks are going to be made to jump through hoops of torture only to have to jump through even more. As a sign that the producers knew the plot was tissue paper thin the gore factor has been turned up way past 10 to ensure there is plenty of look-away moments. <br/><br/>In the end however it's all in vain and after all the blood-splatter and bone breaking we are left with a pretty poor follow up to what was once an original and gripping idea."
"thebrighteyes","1","2","5","24 April 2007"," What is wrong with this writer?
","Why this is a bad movie in 4 easy steps: 1. The plot holes. There are so many of these that it ends up making the entire movie pointless. I wont go into all of them because they are covered in many other reviews, but I will never understand how Jigsaw (even with the help of his new student) can obtain all this torture equipment, medical supplies, & dead pigs without arousing suspicion (or at least going broke). And there is now way that he, in his sickly state, or his student could have installed it all, so they must have gotten outside help. You'd think somebody would ask ""So, uh.... why do you need this furnace installed in the middle of the room right next to the GIANT food grinder?"" 2. The pathetic attempt to explain plot holes of the previous movies. More specifically, the gigantic plot hole in the first SAW when we found out that the guy in the middle of the room who we thought was dead for the entire movie was really the mastermind. So how did he lie perfectly still for 2 hours and why didn't anybody notice him breathing? Well, according to SAW III, he injected himself with some sort of heart-rate-slower right before hand... that really makes a ton of sense.<br/><br/>3. The laughable gore. I guess the extreme violence is supposed to be shocking and scary, but the nude woman getting her ribs ripped off her body looks so fake that it just makes me embarrassed for the person who designed it. Apparently this movie takes place in a universe where the only things that occupy the inside of a human body are miles of small-intestine and gallons upon gallons of blood that looks more like watered down ketchup.<br/><br/>4. The simple plot and one-dimensional characters that are impossible to care about. Between the poor acting, the storyline which is secondary to the gore, the plot holes, and the pointless flashbacks, I really have no idea how to begin caring about any character in this film. The main characters seem only driven by the fact that their son is dead and that they don't want to die. The father is so vengeful that he just seems like an abusive parent anyway.<br/><br/>It escapes me how anyone could like this movie. It is bad even for a Hollywood-horror flick, which is a notoriously bad genre to begin with."

","...It's called Contrived Horror Movie, which has a contrived horror movie villain, who has a contrived horror movie villain voice and is represented by a contrived horror movie puppet, that engages in contrived horror movie puppet laughter.<br/><br/>Can you withstand the torture of sitting through yet another Saw movie? Make your choice....<br/><br/>Same crap, different pile. The tag team duo of Jigsaw and his obedient apprentice Amanda, who have way too much time and money on their hands, return in ""Saw III"" to trap, torture and kill more of their hapless victims. This time they've managed to find the time to kidnap a man named Jeff, who recently lost his son in a criminal accident, the perpetrator in the case, a witness in the case, the judge in the case and, oh yeah, Jeff's wife...and daughter too. <br/><br/>If you're willing to suspend your disbelief and forget about the chances of Jigsaw and Amanda not getting caught, and you get a thrill out of watching people get trapped, brutally tortured and killed, then ""Saw III"" is your movie. There really isn't much point to any of the ""Saw"" movies, besides watching people getting trapped, cruelly tortured and killed."
"ragingsamosa","1","2","5","23 March 2007"," Not even worth renting
","The weak plot is the biggest (but not the only) problem for this movie. The beginning of the movie contains some typical Saw I scenarios, but it quickly becomes evident that the victims literally could not escape their fates regardless of the amount of will that they mustered. Honestly, I'm not sure it is even physically possible for someone to rip a solid iron hook through his own jawbone in a minute without any tools - not to mention that you find out later that the escape door was welded shut anyway. The tests basically degenerate into ways to torture someone to death without the victim having any chance of escaping - basically false hope. I guess the plot was that this was Amanda behaving badly against Jigsaw's wishes, but he is supposed to be pretty omnipotent, so it seems a little stretched that he wouldn't have noticed the first time that she did this.<br/><br/>The later scenarios, which consume most of the movie, revolve around a perpetually angry guy who cannot move on from his son's death in a car accident. He is confronted with various tests of his ability to forgive people involved in various ways with the accident. The obvious difference from Saw I is that this guy holds the fate of each person he encounters in his hands, and he can relatively easily save them - in one situation, all he has to do is burn his son's belongings in a fire to get a key - but it takes him an inordinate amount of time to accept that he should do this. He's just not a very likable guy and he himself is never really in any danger. It seems unfair and un-jigsaw that this man gets to choose who lives and dies - that is supposed to be left up to the victims who ""wasted their lives"". In fact, his anger is so great and consuming that it should have been him whose will to live was tested by Jigsaw.<br/><br/>The other aspect of the plot that was boring was the doctor being forced to keep Jigsaw alive or die herself - it just got annoying to shift back and forth between the warehouse life and death scenarios and the Jigsaw deathbed scenes. There really wasn't much suspense in the Jigsaw deathbed scenes."

","In this second sequel to James Wan's inventive 2004 low-budget shocker Saw, an ex-drug addict and a terminally ill psycho once again play sick games on those judged guilty of 'wasting their lives'. After the lamentable Saw 2, which upped the gore content whilst overlooking the need for a credible plot, I expected the makers of this one to go back to the drawing board, but instead they opted to go one step further and deliver the sickest of the series so far and saddle it with the lamest plot possible.<br/><br/>This time around, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), assistant to creative killer Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), kidnaps a doctor in order to keep her mentor alive to witness the outcome of one final game. Amanda, who has somehow become a top machinist and designer in between abducting people, has created some really nasty traps this time round, and these provide the film with its raison d'être: to disgust the audience in as many ways as possible.<br/><br/>Now I'm no stranger to gory films, and have been known to enjoy some pretty dreadful movies solely on account of their high level of bloodletting, so when I say that I found Saw 3 very tedious despite of its extremely graphic violence, you can take it as gospel that the film sucked big time.<br/><br/>Between the unbelievable death scenes, the movie is as dull as ditch-water and very far-fetched, with Jigsaw spouting more drivel about 'giving people a second chance at life' via his sadistic games, whilst Amanda looks on adoringly. This crap is obviously seen as some kind of justification for his evil doings, but when an innocent doctor is threatened with having her head blown off by multiple shotgun cartridges, the sicko's spiel loses its resonance. <br/><br/>Packed with the annoying grungy, MTV-style editing that is so over-used in horror movies these days, some really awful acting (particulary from Shawnee Smith), and saddled with the most ridiculous 'twist' ending since M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, Saw 3 is the kind of tiresome bilge that is giving the genre a bad name."

It has some hard scenes that i was just into them so much...i my, it had some cheesy dialogue too but besides all i loved its twist and everything that had to do with its ending, it had me completely...its a must see but make sure to see part 1 and 2.<br/><br/>Saw 3 was way better than the Haunted Houses at Universal."
"drownnnsoda","9","2","5","3 November 2006"," Relentlessly Brutal, Surprisingly Good Installment.
","I went in seeing ""Saw III"" with fairly low expectations, because from what I'd seen advertised, this movie didn't look like it was going to be too great. Luckily, I was really surprised. This installment centers on Lynn (Bahar Soomekh, who starred in ""Crash""), a doctor who finds herself awaking to a horrifying situation. Turns out that Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), who is near death from a metastasized brain tumor, has chosen her to operate on him. With an elaborate device clamped on her neck (that will explode once Jigsaw's heart rate bottoms out), she is forced to perform a surgery on him to help save his life, with his assistant/previous victim, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) present. Meanwhile, another man finds himself a part of one of Jigsaw's horrible games, but this time it's up to him to save the lives of others who previously wronged him.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first ""Saw"" film greatly, and also thought ""Saw II"", while a little below-expectations, was still a very good horror film. But man, this one was really great, better than the previous sequel if you ask me. The plot is cleverly woven together to leave the viewer wondering throughout the whole movie, but it keeps your attention the whole way, and manages to be enthralling and consistently interesting. The character development was excellent in this film, something that I think the previous sequel lacked. The characters were sympathetic, and a lot of time was spent on their own psychological torment that tied in with the horrible torture that was occurring in front of their eyes. Just for that, I think this film easily surpassed ""Saw II"". The directing was well done, and is very similar to how the previous movies were shot - lots of dark and light colors, and damp, rusty atmospheres.<br/><br/>The violence this time around is just about as nasty as you're gonna get in an R-rated movie, those who have a weak stomach are advised to avoid this film at all costs, I was questioning whether or not the limits were pushed a little too much myself. But there is a good story to be found underneath the gore, so I think the gratuitousness is forgivable. The only thing that annoyed me about this movie was a character's decision near the end of the film - I won't give it away, but man, I saw really frustrated! Oh well, the rest of this film made up for that minor annoyance.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Saw III"" is the best sequel of this series, in my opinion at least. It was clever, unpredictable, well-acted and written, and relentlessly disturbing. For fans of this series and other relentless horror flicks, ""Saw III"" is definitely a must see. 9/10."

I think she could've carried out Jigsaw's work, even after his death.<br/><br/>But it was an appropriate way for the movie to end.

Having loved the Saw Franchise so far, I knew that I was in for a treat. And oh boy--it was quite a bloody treat. Perhaps,at times, I felt the film was too bloody, but still--it was packed with violence, suspense, great acting (though I wasn't too impressed with Bahar S...could've been better) and a great script with a nice twist at the end, and a nice way of connecting the previous films with reasonable explanations.<br/><br/>Acting: 9/10- Tobin is Jigsaw--no one else can play the role. I really admired Shawnee, the girl who played Amanda--she was great. Like I said earlier, Bahar S. didn't really do it for me... she was like on and off... and the guy who played Jeff did a great job.<br/><br/>Cinematography- 10/10- I love the way this film was filmed--very professional and nice.<br/><br/>Music- I actually noticed the music in this film...it was creepy and upbeat... and i digged the piano part. 8/10 directing: better job directing this one than Saw II--more stylish, more gore, just one casting mistake...everything else= perfect. Bravo 10/10 Script: Apparently, it was written under a week; though, the ending wasn't as twisted as the first two, it was memorable still... cool deaths--very creative 9/10 Gore- 10/10-- this is the goriest film I've ever seen.

","Since 2004, the Saw series has been thrilling horror fans around the globe, and is hailed by many as a new life for a dead genre. The box office intake for each film has increased with each movie made, pleasing not only the fans, but also the film's creators. The movies are all made on a very small budget, which makes their success even more of a delight. After seeing Saw III, I can safely say that this may very well be the best horror trilogy ever created. While Saw IV is already set for a release next Halloween, I'm not sure that they can ever top what happened in the first three movies. Saw III is directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II) and written by the brilliant Leigh Whannel (Adam from Saw, writer of Saw and Saw II) and James Wan (writer and director of Saw).<br/><br/>In Saw III, Jigsaw is on his death bed. His cancer is finally about to end him, and he plans for Amanda, his apprentice, to take over once he dies. As a sort of going away present, Jigsaw plans one final game of grand scale. This time around, Lynn, an experienced surgeon, and Jeff, a troubled father, become entangled in Jigsaw's grizzly web of torture and violence; Lynn must keep Jigsaw alive until Jeff finishes his tests.<br/><br/>Saw III would be the ideal ending to the Saw franchise, with loads of flashbacks, explanations, nearly perfect closure, and the most gore of any film in recent memory. The gore is really piled on here, with bones snapping, pig carcasses grinding, rib-cages ripped off  it doesn't get any worse than this. But this is, perhaps, what makes these films so great for horror fans. With all of the blood and guts displayed on the screen is a well-played-out story with plenty of twists and turns and interesting characters.<br/><br/>The traps are also an important part in any Saw film, and we get plenty of them here, including a twisting, mechanical crucifix crudely titled ""The Rack"", a device that attached to ones ribs that tears them out, and many others which involve chains, shotgun shells, and other such horrors.<br/><br/>The film also delves much deeper into the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda, and gives the audience a behind the scenes look at what makes these killers tick. The acting is superb, perhaps the best so far in the series. The writers and directors seem to have learned what the fans really want, and delivered an amazing horror movie that is an instant classic.<br/><br/>You'll shield your eyes, you'll look away in disgust, you might even throw up  it really is that nasty. Saw III is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film, which makes it all the better. While Saw II is still my favorite movie of all time, Saw III is definitely on my Top 10. Rating  10/10"

Rest assured for all you loyal fans, just get through the first 20 minutes with an open mind, and I promise it will come to you his plot as the first few scenes seem very unlike his previous works. This movie ties up any and all loose ends concerning the series previous movies and brings a finality to the series that not even Spielberg, Lucas, Craven and Cameron put together could revive. The only way this series could breath again, even 10 years from now woud be if they went even further into his previous work as we can all be completely sure about the fate of Jigsaw from this movie. And to think, this continuation of the series is truly, unlike a lot of movie, quite literally a continuation of the series from part one through its current release. You will not be disappointed.

","""Why should I see Saw III,"" you ask, deftly avoiding yet another lame pun on the movie's title. ""I didn't see Saw or Saw II."" Well, first of all, if you didn't see those two, shame on you. I'll forgive you, of course, because I'm nice, but shame on you nonetheless. Both of the previous two Saw films are fantastic horror films, a real credit to the genre. I mean, they're eye-popping in their gore, but there's enough of a psychological undertone do always keep the audience guessing.<br/><br/>It is, as you might surmise, the same with III. Only, heavy is the head that wears the crown; the team behind the Saw films are victims of their own creativity. It's one thing to churn out meaningless sequels when all you're doing is splattering nubile twits, but when you're following Saw and Saw II, you have to fight to reach the bar you've set for yourself.<br/><br/>Luckily, James Wan and Leigh Whannell have done just that. The nefarious Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is back, and as we saw at the end of Saw II, he's not alone - his accomplice is the lovely, the twisted Amanda (Shawnee Smith). Near the beginning of the movie, we see a SWAT team burst into a room where one of Jigsaw's victims apparently exploded from one of the villain's diabolical traps. This might lead you to think the movie will be a cat and mouse game between Jigsaw and the cops, but this notion is quickly quelled when the lead investigator becomes a Jigsaw victim herself.<br/><br/>Jigsaw is all about games, of course, so although it takes a little while to get there we finally get to the story's main game. A young man wakes up in a large wooden box; he eventually is forced through several ""tests,"" each of which is somehow related to the death of the man's son in an auto accident. Can the man (played by Angus McFadyen of Braveheart) face his inner demons by way of these tests (Jigsaw's games carry a moralistic theme)? Meanwhile, as we saw at the end of Saw II, Jigsaw isn't doing so well, physically speaking, so he enlists (er, coerces) a pretty, young, driven doctor (Bahar Soomekh) to keep him alive. Oh, and to entice her to do just that, he has Amanda fit the doctor with a special collar. He wouldn't be Jigsaw without his collars! I may have given away a little too much already, you're thinking, but there's so many twists and turns and sudden shocks that it shouldn't matter much at all. The movie is chock full of pulse-quickening, heart-pounding horrors, from the creeping-up-on-you kind to the WHAM HITTING YOU IN THE FACE WITH A SHOVEL kind; that is, director Darren Lynn Bousman is quite adept at manipulating the pace of the movie to freak you the heck out. Do you like closeups of oozing blood? Limbs and sinews bursting? How about brain surgery, do you have an affinity for that? I wouldn't recommend the movie if you're the kind who has to run from the theater when a needle punctures skin, or if you're pregnant - a couple of these jolting scenes might induce labor.<br/><br/>Saw III is the latest in what's become the new wave of horror movies: lower-budget films with small, unknown casts that are heavy on shock and plot rather than special effects and pizazz. If you enjoyed any of the previous two Saw films and/or Hostel, if you think watching an autopsy would be a wonderful first date, then Saw III shouldn't cause you much worry - well, maybe other than holding your hand in front of your face sometimes. Not that I ever did that.<br/><br/>The ultimate question, of course, is whether there will be a Saw IV, since a recent trend is for movie series to contain only three films. I cannot unequivocally say that there will not be a fourth entry, because although the end does seem final, there is at least one major loose end that could be explored."

The plot was not interesting to me, but since I don't want to give away the ending (as if you couldn't figure it out for yourself halfway through), I won't say anymore about it.<br/><br/>If you really love the first Saw movies, then I guess go see this one, but if you're a mild fan of the series (maybe you've seen one or the other or parts of either), don't bother.

"Nycfilmguy84","5","2","5","28 October 2006"," Saw 3, Worst Installment of the Saw Franchise
","Personally I think Saw 3 is mediocre and the definitely the worst of the 3 films. The suspense, intrigue and mystery the first two films is missing in the third film. And the visual creativeness that Bousman brought to the first sequel is also unapparent.<br/><br/>The film is rushed, the writing is lazy and uncreative. Instead of doing these films every year and turning them out quickly take a year off. Work on the script longer possibly 6 months fine tune it and release Saw IV Halloween, 2008. Skipping a year is not going to diminish the popularity of the franchise. A weak installment like Saw 3 does diminish its popularity. Saw 3 is poised to gross even more than Saw 2 and will be the 2nd highest grossing horror of all time next to The Sixth Sense. A bigger box office total will rescue the weak Saw 3 from taking a hit in popularity but why is it essential to turn these out every year. Every other year is more than enough. Horror fans will never go away. The Western and musicals are long dead. Pure sci-fi is rarely produced but the popularity of horrors never wanes."

","I was intrigued by the release of Saw3, my main hope was that it wasn't a ploy to cash in on the success of the first two films a la Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th etc. Thankfully this isn't the case, if you were a little confused by the second one, this film goes along way to explaining some of the detail behind the first two films as a whole, it also gives more of an insight into Jigsaw's rationale, and a bigger chunk of Amanda's history and her involvement. The trap scenes are up to, if not beyond the standard set in the first two films and trust me if you are squeamish you may find one or two of them hard to watch. Once again there are main characters that the story centres around and plays with the emotion baggage they are laboured with, and it is done to great effect. What I found especially good about this film is the pace of it. It doesn't let up from the opening scenes until the end, it keeps you in suspense and also as with the first two there is the niggling feeling there is one final twist that you may have missed or not expected, does it have one? Well to find out you will have to go and see for yourself, suffice to say, in my humble opinion, if you are a fan of the first two films, you will not be disappointed by this one."
"lightzonlycast","5","2","5","28 October 2006"," A total botch of a film
","I was very excited about the 3rd installment of the saw series. I always enjoyed psychological thrillers; however, the makers of this film totally disregarded the premise set in the previous two films in exchange for a gore fest which, at the end, really leaves the audience pretty upset.<br/><br/>There's so much going on in this movie that is completely ridiculous (Tobin Bell's character still being alive, Lacy performing open head surgery with a power drill, etc etc). Unlike the previous two films, this one focuses less on story and more on gore/torture scenes. If you are a fan of the series because it was an intriguing story, stay away from Saw III because it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth, and it won't come from the excessive amounts of gore/blood the makers of this film decided to include."

"kluseba","9","1","2","24 January 2019"," Facing the philosophical aspect of forgiveness
","After a grilsy yet intellectual first movie and an intense psychological duel for the sequel, this third entry in the franchise deals with the philosophical aspect of forgiveness. Serial killer John Kramer is on his deathbed but he keeps organizing his twisted games in order to make people value their lives until his final breath. He asks an accomplice to kidnap a doctor who must make sure the serial killer survives until his latest victim succeeds in completing a series of particularly intriguing tests as a broken family father must decide whether he forgives those who are responsible for his son's tragic death that also destroyed his life. However, it's not only his latest victim who has to decide to be forgiving as another person is also playing a game without even knowing it.<br/><br/>The strongest element of the movie is its philosophical depth when the viewers needs to wonder how they would react under specific circumstances. Could you forgive a driver who hits your son so badly that he dies? How would you feel about a witness to this accident who doesn't intervene? What would you do to a judge that spares the reckless driver from a harsh sentence? The movie teaches us that we are all monsters inside but have different capacities in controling them.<br/><br/>This third entry is also the one with the greatest depth regarding the dying serial killer. One understands his motivations better than in previous installments. He is open to discuss his points of view on his deathbed which gives us a strangely fascinating yet gloomily repelling insight.<br/><br/>The film's stunning conclusion manages to surprise yet again as all loose ends are tied together and lead to a dramatic showdown that viewers won't see coming. The scriptwriters still manage to add intellectual depth at the most unexpected moments. The clever ending is rewarding and already leaves the viewers wanting to watch the next installment.<br/><br/>The philosophical aspect of forgiveness makes this movie stand out. The dealy traps are slightly less twisted than before but much more personal for the test subjects. Thanks to this fresh approach, this film is only slightly less intriguing than the strong immediate predecessor. Fans of the series can't get around watching this film. Saw III underlines the franchise's status as greatest horror film series of the new millennium."

Really glad I binge watched 1,2 and 3. Everything made perfect sense and the planning involved to execute his game, although mind-boggling at times, was sheer brilliance.

"TheLittleSongbird","4","1","2","28 November 2017"," Neither disturbing or puzzling
","Finally saw all the 'Saw' films prior to seeing 'Jigsaw' (as part of my wanting to see as many 2017 films as possible this year, during a quieter and less intensive period). Heard a lot about the films, good and bad, but wanted to see them for myself to know what to expect.<br/><br/>The films as an overall series are a very mixed bag. The original 'Saw' had a great premise and while it was problematic it was still pretty good and one of the best in the series. 'Saw II' had its own problems but it was still one of the few follow-ups to be just as good and have what made the first click as well as it did. However, whereas there was the sense that the novelty was still there with 'Saw II', in 'Saw III' it's the opposite, not just gone but almost done to death. It just goes over the top in some elements and forgets what elements were instrumental in the series' appeal.<br/><br/>'Saw III' is not unwatchable by all means. Credit is due for providing origins for Jigsaw, one of those characters where his modus operandi, impulse and justification sets him apart from most characters of his type, and his enthusiastic helper. The music score is suitably eerie.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, the film is also performed surprisingly quite well, especially a suitably tortured Angus McFadyen and a bone-chilling Tobin Bell, if there is one thing that hasn't lost impact and continued to not do so it's Bell. Donnie Wahlberg continues to show that he is a vast improvement over Cary Elwes, but he doesn't have much to do here.<br/><br/>On the other hand, a big problem with 'Saw III' is that it isn't that disturbing or puzzling. There aren't the truly ingenious traps, just as imaginative demises or the devilishly clever twists seen previously (primarily the twist ending of the first). They are instead replaced by rambling exposition, a flashback-within-flashback framework that just confuses the story and the viewer and a distastefully overblown over-reliance on violence and gore. It was just overkill, and actually made the film exhausting and almost unintentionally funny in places.<br/><br/>Will admit that the script was not a strength in either of the first two films, but even they weren't this flat or insultingly contrived. At least too they had clever and intriguing moments and were easy to follow, this cannot be said for the script for 'Saw III'. The story is basically a retread that's both overdone and anaemic and has little sense of unease or suspense, the exposition/flashback-heavy structure and the very flawed execution of it hurting it severely. It also multiplies any credibility lapses and ridiculousness of before by a hundred and doesn't really go to anywhere much until the climactic moments, which felt so unresolved it was almost like a cheat.<br/><br/>Missed the effectively claustrophobic look of the first 'Saw' and the more elaborate and no less creepy one for the second film. Here the production values just look rushed and amateurish, especially in the editing. Bahar Soomekh does her best as Lynn, though believing her as a surgeon is a bit of a stretch. The direction doesn't seem as assured and the film really could have done with being 15-20 minutes shorter.<br/><br/>In conclusion, okay for 'Saw' series completests but neither disturbing or puzzling. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
"Bababooe","1","1","2","13 November 2017"," Implausible! Garbage! Cheap amateur filmmaking! – Advice, next time perhaps you try to think, before leaving positive reviews on garbage films.
","OK, I bought the DVD with the first 7 Saw movies. The first was decent when I saw it years ago, watching it last year, no more surprises so I thought it was just OK, a C rating for a B movie. #2 sucked full on. Crappy lighting, cinematography, editing, acting, dialogue, convoluted story. Just plain garbage.<br/><br/>Now, #3. The best part about this movie was the chained guy, and the chained female cop. Straight up copy from Hellraiser! And I enjoyed Donnie smashing his foot, next time they should try Donnie smashing his face! Besides these scenes this movie is garbage.<br/><br/>The cinematography was not as bad as #2. But still amateur, point and shoot. The editing is quick and garbage. The lighting is crap. The acting is horrible. The characters are garbage. Nobody acts like this. Tobin Bell seems like a decent actor, but I hate his voice, and his character and dialogue is garbage. Shawnee Smith's character is garbage. If she's crazy, then make her character crazy. But then, how the hell could they pull off all the kidnappings, and all the equipment and set up? It is impossible. It can't happen. And that is where most of the problem is. How the hell did she get into the female cops apartment without the cop noticing. Think about it! Where were these abandoned locations? The only way you can have access to locations like this is if you have a film studio paying to rent them and shooting the film, but not if you're a wackjob on a mission to teach some people with emotional problems a lesson on how to appreciate life. The female doctors acting was OK, not great. And the husband who lost his boy, this guy was plain horrible. The frozen woman was OK, but then we get a scene of her completely frozen, very stiff! The judge, OK. The black guy, well he acted terrified.<br/><br/>The story and the twists. Now, I'm sure someone can come up with something better than this.<br/><br/>Last two weeks I watched the first 8 Hellraiser movies. First 2 were decent because of the stories. The rest were below par mix bag of I don't know what. But at least all of them were better than Saw 2 or 3. The older I get, the more I want stories. Compelling stories, with characters that relate, and actors that can portray plausible situations, within the context of the film. Saw 3, and Saw 2 do not do that. These stories only happen because the screenwriter wrote them and the production team went ahead and filmed and produced the product for our supposed entertainment. I cannot believe that some said hey, how the hell did some sick guy and a drugged out/wacko chick pull off all these sets and traps, and kidnap all these people. Lots of equipment all around. Is Jig independently wealth? So, some points for the chain kills near the beginning of the film, minus stealing scenes from Hellraiser. This film is a complete failure. F, 1 star, garbage."

"steveneven","5","1","2","27 September 2014"," ""Saw""'s exercise in nihilism is extremely gratuitous
","The great thing about ""Saw III"" is that if you skipped out on the first two outings, you will not be lost. The bad? There is not much to see here. I mean if you like your limbs twisted, ripped apart, and frozen, you could certainly do worse. <br/><br/>""Saw III"" picks up from where ""Saw II"" ended. This time Amanda is Jigsaw's apprentice and matter is taken into her hands. To Amanda's dismay, Jigsaw's life is ticking away like his heart meter. This can only mean that Lynn, an elite neurosurgeon, will step up to the plate and get Jigsaw up and running. In the meantime, Jigsaw has implemented torturous traps, which Eric leads. <br/><br/>This sounds like a pretty convoluted and incoherent story line, but ""Saw III"" is really the former. Surprisingly, I found the plot to not meander, and I found it pretty consistent. Of course, the break-neck pacing and MTV-style jump cuts get tiring, but enough questions are answered to keep ""Saw"" fans satisfied. What is refreshing this time around is that there is more attention paid to the characters. We learn more about John (Jigsaw), Amanda, and even Eric. Now this is not some Shakespearean character study, but I give director Darren Lynn Bousman some credit.<br/><br/>This also seems like soap opera ""Saw""- running a good two hours, as opposed to the standard 90 minutes of mayhem. This is John Kramer at his most personal. For gorehounds, there is plenty of gratuitous spill here. There are at least two traps that will make you vomit as much as John Kramer. <br/><br/>Yet, Bousman lowers the body count. This was a smart move because ""Saw III"" the script comes first, then the gore. Screenwriter Leigh Whannell definitely does not disappoint in those categories. While he minimizes the amount of dismemberment, he does not minimize it enough. When the film arrives at the ""The Rack"" trap, the violence becomes masturbatory. Masturbatory to the point of some traps being copouts. It seems like everyone is made to go through hell, even when they ""won"" or already underwent their missions. <br/><br/>What also does not work is complicating Eric's backstory. Too many people are involved, too many consequences for a particular incident, and etc. It seemed like Whannell wanted to make this the ""Twin Towers"" of Jigsawville. There is just so much ""payment"" and chaos, it does not come off as profound. It just comes across as misanthropic and utterly gratuitous. <br/><br/>What I did find refreshing is how different this film felt compared to ""Saw II"" and ""Saw"". ""Saw II"" was a remake of the first, but not as interesting. The exposition was so mind-numbingly dull, it was a chore to sit through. The traps made up for it, but we come to ""Saw"" for a decent plot line AND some traps. We do not just take the gravy and leave the mashed potatoes. In ""Saw III"", we get more exposition than the first, but it is more interesting and dynamic. The pieces really fit in a ""jigsaw"".<br/><br/>While it sounds like I admired ""Saw III"", which I did to an extent, it is something I will not see again. This is ""CSI"" level of entertainment, and it is nearly made on that budget. You will get some cool insight into the characters, the ending is pretty climactic (or should I say ""anticlimactic""), and ""oh yes, there will be blood"" as Jigsaw promises. It just feels like too much. I would advise a rental if you really need to seek out Tobin Bell (Jigsaw)'s latest outing."

There is no shortage of blood, gore and graphic scenes, which make this more of a gory rather than a scary horror film. Like the previous movies, this sequel is very disturbing - just the bloody intro will give you an impression where this sadistic film will take you.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good, but the rest of the movie's elements is just dark and depressing.

","By 2006 the now-passe torture porn sub-genre was in full swing. The producers of Saw were enjoying the profits made from cheaply and easily grossing-out morbid audiences with icky gore and people screaming. It's not clever, and it's not even remotely classy.<br/><br/>Clocking in at just under two hours, this is the longest of the Saw series, but the constant flashbacks that bloat that running time are already becoming very tiresome and gives the movie the feel of a TV show. Chopping the heavy plot into vignettes is not very theatrical or interesting.<br/><br/>With Jigsaw still at large and Donnie Wahlberg's angry cop now missing the cops begin to suspect that Jiggy has an accomplice. This is all forgotten about by the five-minute mark as the movie then sidetracks into a story about a man who has lost his son in a car accident and wishes for retribution. Jiggy arranges for the retribution to happen, but advises him to save the people responsible from gruesome death instead of letting them die.<br/><br/>Jiggy's judgement and justification is already becoming dubious and morally suspect by this point. I half expect him to start kidnapping and setting-up people for watching too much Nickelodeon or flying too many kites. The morality should go both ways. If Jiggy is subjecting so many people to unbearable agony then he should have experience and knowledge of much, much more than simply dying of cancer and surviving a car crash. Who does he think he is? Ultimately, he's just as bad as the people he is judging.<br/><br/>The story is worthy of a higher score, but as usual it is bogged down by horrendous editing, cheap photography filled with fake filters, a loud sound design filled with nonsensical effects, and characters who do not think logically.<br/><br/>It reminded me a lot of Hellraiser, only with none of the magic. Unfortunately, for anyone watching the whole series, it's vital that you digest every minute, overwrought plot point."
"thomasspencer","2","1","2","30 May 2013"," There goes the intelligence...
","Upon having myself my very own Saw Marathon to catch up on the horror series I missed out on, I have decided to end it here. The reason? In all honesty, I no longer felt comfortable with the way the series was heading.<br/><br/>But let's start at the beginning. Saw 3 picks up where the second left off, with Detective Eric Matthews still chained in the infamous unused bathroom featuring the corpses of past Saw characters. Here, the film promised a lot, as I enjoyed Donnie Wahlberg's irritable, takes no nonsense portrayal from the second film. But with a bang, boom and snap, the character just disappears from the story. The film is then split in two, following a father going through a series of traps in Jigsaw's test for forgiveness and Jigsaw/John himself, being treated for his cancer. <br/><br/>Firstly, lets tackle the most well known section of any Saw film, the traps. As Jigsaw's latest are presented, it is very clear the makers were now going for shock over substance. This reliance does not bode well for the final film, as I personally found myself cringing and looking away, hoping that these elongated gory scenes would hurry and finish. I no longer had the fixed, morbid curiosity the first two played on so well. The horrified thought process of 'what would I do in that situation?' was gone. That creepy intelligence the first two had replaced with dumb, slasher-like kills. My first disappointment. <br/><br/>The acting, which I didn't expect to be top-notch considering this was a third installment to a horror franchise, wasn't especially atrocious but it wasn't exceptionally good either. Tobin Bell is as 'meh' as ever and from what small amount of time Donnie Wahlberg had was entertaining due to his understanding of his own character. Other returning members of the cast include Dina Meyer (who was unforgivably underused) and Shawnee Smith (who was unforgivably overused). New members of the cast are extremely average, most memorably Angus Macfayden who portrays the tragic father character mentioned previously. I must say the actor deserves an award for playing one of the most unlikable protagonists in cinema history. Everything this character does is idiotic and frustrating. Macfayden seems to do the best he can to work with such a horrible, horrible part but it's just not enough. My second disappointment.<br/><br/>As much as I despised the disgusting trap sub plot, I can't say anything better for the ill Jigsaw plot itself. Although initially interesting, tense and a breath of fresh air from watching pointless suffering, it quickly turned to nonsense and became quite a bore. I don't know why the makers are adamant on the audience caring for the villain. I was far more interested in Bahar Soomekh's brain surgeon present, but perhaps that's a matter of opinion. <br/><br/>But, as a trademark, eventually these subplots came together in a twisting revelation delivered in the final ten minutes of the film. I'll admit, I spent much of the film watching only to hear a reprise of that oh so good 'Hello Zepp' theme traditional in the Saw films. But this pay-off was so lazy, confusing and layered it only came across as humorous and silly. My third disappointment and, as you know, three strikes and you're out. <br/><br/>Overall, it's a poor film and the fact that the Saw films were reduced to this is sad. Although I can't expect anything else from a cheaply made, studio ordered sequel only made for money over purpose of story, I still expected something, anything, that would be enjoyable. But no. The story is flawed, the characters are awful and the traps/tests are almost unwatchable in regards to gore. Horrible. If you're thinking of watching this after you enjoyed the first two, do yourself a favor. Stop there, and remember the series as two successful, clever films and not as the torture porn, ridiculous series it has become today."

","The makers of Saw III construct the film the way a preschool child makes a block tower. For the first hour Saw III is not only more freaky than Saw but it is one of the freakiest of slasher films. With each new block placed on top of another, the scenario gets more extreme, until one block too many causes the whole thing to collapse. The last twenty to thirty minutes of the film are a clumsy error of epic proportions. It is hard to say whether the makers were looking for away to bring an end to the Saw series or a way to continue it. All I can tell you is that what starts of pretty good turns into the kind of thing that makes you loose complete faith in James Wan, just another young mind who had a brilliant Idea which he took too far and is now six movies. <br/><br/>Jigsaw is dying. and his apprentice kidnaps a young nurse, straps an explosive device around her neck, which will go off the minute Jigsaw's heart rate stops. That doesn't give her a lot of time to save his life. Meanwhile on the other side of his layer, Jigsaw's next victim is about to play the game. <br/><br/>The one advantage that Saw II had over Saw what that we got to meet Jigsaw himself, not the puppet. Jobin Bell did his best to bring a large dose of Hannibal Lector to the role, something which he was not able to do twice. In Saw III, he is no more than a piece of rotting flesh spewing badly scripted lines. I blame the script writers more than Bell for the lousy characterization of Jigsaw in this movie.<br/><br/>The climactic twist is the most frustrating part of the film, because not only do you see it coming, but it wrecks the movie. Had the filmmakers thought things through a little better, Saw III may have been good enough to make the idea of Saw IV sound promising.

Not only is it needlessly gory, original SAW writers Leigh Whannell and James Wan try to connect the existing SAW movies in a Grande Trilogy that almost works, but only succeeds in pulling back the curtain on the skull-splitting intrigue that drove the original SAW.<br/><br/>Shawnee Smith (who keeps getting hotter with each SAW) reprises her role as Amanda, and it is revealed that her role in all three SAWs was more integral than any of us had imagined. Backstory flies all over the place like intestines at a werewolf party; seems that after Amanda escaped the infamous head-bear-trap in SAW, she was so thankful to Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) for alerting her to the error of her junkie ways, she became his bottom bitch and has been aiding him with gags ever since - including the very first one with Leigh Whannell and Cary Elwes in SAW.<br/><br/>TMI, dudes. Dial the backstory down to OCEAN'S TWELVE.<br/><br/>SAW III picks up exactly where SAW II left off - Donnie Wahlberg as Detective Matthews chained to a pipe, in the movie's most powerful scene, which hearkens back to the hook that separated SAW from its knife-kill ilk - self-mutilation for the sake of escape.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as with II, after the stomach-churning opening, it's downhill on a tricycle with no brakes, Jiggie Doll eck-eck-ecking his little spiral-red cheeks.<br/><br/>The connecting tissue in SAW III involves two stories: nurse Lynn (Bahar Soomekh) must keep Jigsaw alive through a graphic head operation, with the threat of a bullet necklace going off in her face if she lets him die; and Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) wanders through a house of traps where people involved in his son's accidental death are in mid-torture, his decision to either forgive them or let them die - but forgiveness will bring him one step closer to the ultimate killer of his son...<br/><br/>That microcassette gag has become tiresome beyond redemption. At every trap, Jeff finds that infamous cassette that explains his conundrum, but the traps and situations are now so complex, it wears on our senses. The question becomes not how to escape the trap, but how ingeniously the trap was set up: people have to be stalked, studied, captured, inserted into their marvelously deadly traps, which have to be constructed from scratch, from no existing designs, meticulously working on timers, with all their escape points nullified so that there IS no escape, psychologically or physically... the logistics are mind-boggling.<br/><br/>And that's when the nonsense of it all bleeds through. Even if Amanda was the most ambitious serial killer in the world, she still wouldn't have time to set all this up, avoid the authorities, pay the electric bill and still have time to apply makeup and lip gloss and keep her hairstyle so street-cred skanky.<br/><br/>And when we see Jigsaw convulsing and vomiting in pain on his makeshift hospital bed, we recall our own human frailties. Think about those stomach aches that throw your whole day into disarray: a virus? gas? kidney stone? botulism? renal failure? A thousand sicknesses could double you over and make you a wailing child again, and you can't focus on anything except stopping the mind-curdling pain; you can't even plan ahead to LUNCH - yet Jigsaw, whose pain levels are immeasurable (as he reminds us constantly), can still summon the will to concoct ridiculously innovative methods of killing other people ""to teach them a lesson."" Insanity or genius? It just doesn't gel with what we know of human pain; in the midst of pain, it is impossible to think of inflicting it on others - we want to selfishly stop our own pain first.<br/><br/>Admittedly, Jigsaw is a psychopath. But most psychopaths we encounter in knife-kill flicks are in prime health. Jigsaw, in the throes of convulsions, would still feel physical trauma as a human. Would that he used his ingenuity to outfit his dank little dungeon with methods to curb his pain, rather than spread pain outwards through Amanda.<br/><br/>His first gags in SAW were in the early stages of his disease, so his psychosis could be accepted as that of a dying man erroneously mistaking killing others as grasping for a last spark of vitality. But here, every semblance of reason and motivation has been lost due to his near death condition.<br/><br/>A powerful, surprising ending does nothing to curb our pain, and we know that even though SAW III ties it up with grand deaths all over the place, the franchise will limp on, fueled by contrivance.<br/><br/>In the words of Monty Python, ""Oh, you're no fun anymore!"""
"JoeKarlosi","6","1","2","28 October 2009"," Saw III (2006) **1/2
","I saw this installment originally in the theater, but this is the first time I watched the extended ""Unrated"" version. I hear there's also an even longer third version that's a ""Director's Cut"", but this is getting confusing. In the third chapter, Jigsaw is literally at death's door, so he has his devoted assistant Amanda (Shawnee Smith) kidnap a young female surgeon named Lynn to force her to operate on him to save his life. The doctor and her husband Jeff are currently facing a rocky road in their marriage, so Jeff is now simultaneously forced to undergo a series of tests in Jigsaw's maze of horror and death contraptions, with Lynn's own survival hinging on the outcome. Jeff has also been living a life full of anger and bitterness ever since a drunk driver killed his son, and his journey through Jigsaw's torture chamber may hold the key to confronting the man who was responsible. This entry has a few good ideas and boasts some of the most inventive death traps in this series, and we also get to feel some sympathy for Jigsaw and his dedicated apprentice Amanda. A slight drawback may be that - at least with the extended Unrated Edition - there is way too much over-abundance of blood, gore, and guts, to the point where it takes a little away from the effectiveness of the film as a whole, even for a SAW sequel. However, this is a SAW movie after all, and all things considered it's a strong enough entry that should satisfy fans of the series to one extent or another. **1/2 out of ****"
"devilgonnatemptyou","3","1","2","17 June 2009"," The weakest in the series
","I am a big fan of the 'Saw' series and I was naturally anticipating Saw 3. To be perfectly honest, it really was the worst out of the series.<br/><br/>The horror and gore is on top form and the various traps that a fluent in the movie are inventive but my problem with this film is that it is TOO relentless and I don't remember a single character surviving (even though there was many chances for a few of them to live through the story) it kin of got repetitive because I knew that EVERYONE was going to die.<br/><br/>My other problem is the painfully irritating main character who seems to take forever to make up his mind on whether to forgive the people 'responsible' for his sons accidental death, then just as he decides the good option, they end up dead! That really annoyed me.<br/><br/>With a franchise like this, you have to tread very carefully that the story doesn't dwindle and fizzle out and I thought the series was dying out with this movie because it didn't offer us anything new or anything to care about. The only difference is we find out a few twists at the end but wasn't enough for me.<br/><br/>Don't be disappointed however, as Saw 4 was much, much better."
"BigBirdtheBum","3","1","2","27 February 2008"," A major, i mean MAJOR decline in quality......such a shame.......
","Saw III I honestly believe it is such as shame that this so far good franchise was damaged by this pathetic excuse for an entry into film series. The first two films of the series relied a lot on suspense and scares, but disgustingly this film does not. It transforms itself into a mindless gore-fest that seems to be trying to make people throw up rather than provide them with suspense and scares. From the word go the film will disappoint many fans from each turn, the ones complex and intriguing plot is replaced with a B-movie story.<br/><br/>Aside from providing the viewers with a good scare and of course a good time, I believe this film also fails on many levels including; writing, pacing and character development. The writing in this film is filled with cliché and predictable dialogue that seems to be used in every horror film. For example some of the conversations between Amanda and Lynn seem bland and as I said earlier cliché. The characters in this film are developed poorly and seem to be very uninteresting and unrealistic. This is scene with Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda. On many occasions Amanda will suddenly become angry and seconds later start to cry and then revert to a neutral emotion! I mean come on! That is unrealistic even for a movie. Aside from Amanda the character of Jeff is developed hardly ever and if he is I think it is rather done poorly. As the only real development we see of him is in some crummy little flashbacks that I think are rather forced into place rather then carefully placed in.<br/><br/>Aside from issues with characters the film also possesses problems with the plot. The plot is developed very poorly and seems to jump forward prematurely. As well as plot pacing issues the very simplistic plot which does not do justice with the plots of the first ""Saw"" or even ""Saw II"".<br/><br/>Aside from these negatives there are thankfully a few positives that unfortunately are smothered by the horrible negative factors of the film. On the light side the film does have some very good gore, which will satisfy gore hungers (but not me) and also does have some rather different and far more complicated traps then seen in the first two films. These traps did provide me and I suppose everyone else with a sense of progression with Jigsaw's and Amanda's work and of course there engineering skill.<br/><br/>In conclusion I would recommend this film only for hardcore fans of the series and lovers of gore. It is also fair to note that this film is far more violent than its predecessors and I would not recommend it for anyone below the age of 14 as they may be disturbed by the violence and torture. Summing up I will give this film a 3.3/10."

"Roadwarrior85846","6","1","2","12 November 2007"," The SAW series's rotten apple.
","When I watched SAW II, I said to myself, ""This could've been better."" But after watching SAW III, I changed my mind about that. SAW III was mediocre but not the best one in the series so far. The only time it felt like the original SAW feeling is the first 20 minutes of the movie. After that, it felt the movie landed into somebody else's hands. The gore in this one was amazing and brutal but flashing all that blood to me did not cut it for me. The flashbacks were cool, but the current events were just bland. I did not like John's two new victims at all because they didn't feel like they were connected into the story. The acting was decent and the actress, Shawnee Smith played Amanda, was incredibly hot in this one. I notice there were a lot of mini cliffhangers throughout the movie which is a sign for the fourth one which i totally liked. But what turned me off the most was the ending. I'm not going to spoil it for you but lets put it this way. My reaction to the first ending: ""Whoa! OMG! I didn't see that coming!"" My reaction to the second ending: ""Really?! Damn! I never thought of that!"" My reaction to the third ending: ""WHAT?!?!? C'mon!!! You gotta be kidding me!!!!""<br/><br/>See? So anyways, if you are a fan of the Saw movies, it's OK to see it. It's not gonna kill you or anything...or will it?"

"lagriff05","6","1","2","11 September 2007"," Weak and pretentious
","The first SAW film wasn't the best movie, and it had severe flaws in the directing, acting, and scriptwriting. But it's plot wasn't very derivative, although influenced by Se7en and other such thrillers. It was a pretty damn good plot line in a time when horror movies seemed to mean nothing else but crappy remakes of Japanese or Korean films with busty blonds and pale, anorexic little children possessed by evil spirits. It was a fun movie, with some good gore and some very interesting ideas, and was overall watchable if you turned off your critical brain for a few hours, an above average film overall. After months and months of critical acclaim and popularity that seemed to spread like a disease, we got the second SAW, which was mediocre at best, and then we got this the very next year. While initially appealing, SAW 3 sadly continues the downward spiral into mediocrity that had so plagued the second film after more than one viewing.<br/><br/>What's wrong with it? I'd say it's just weak. The SAW movies may get brandied about on radio talk-shows and newspaper clippings as being the most extreme, outrageous, violent movies out there, but if you walked into this one looking for blood and guts, you'll be rather disappointed. This is actually the weakest of the three SAW films, not only in terms of quality, but also in terms of go-for-the-throat brutality and plot twists. Compared to the mad-carnival thrill ride of the first SAW (which only featured two men alone in a room, by the way), this film is positively neutered. Sure, it seems menacing at first, especially the fabled brain surgery scene, but once you're used to it, you realize just how blunt this beast's teeth are.<br/><br/>My main example here is the 'games' featured here. The traps on display here are oddly restrained. The first movie featured an intriguing, spine-tingling trap involving a man who cut his wrists regularly, even though his life was perfectly fine. Our suicidal friend was locked in an iron cage, barbed wire criss-crossed over every bare inch of space inside it. To make it out alive, he'd have to cut himself again and again on the spiky barbs to reach the door, which would close forever once an hour was up. Compare this to the first (main) trap featured in SAW 3 - we have a naked woman tied to some poles above her in an ice-cold freezer, dangling there like a pendulum as our hero enters the frigid prison. His task is to...squeeze in between some bars and fetch a key behind them, ripping off some skin on his face as it touches the frozen bars. Excuse me, but I expected far, far more from a movie like this. You could tell me that the hooks trap from the beginning was good, and maybe it was, but it still doesn't hold a candle to the barbed wire stunt from the first movie either way, mainly serving as a poor ripoff of that one, if even that. It's pathetic, really, that all they could come up with here was either a boring rehash of an older trap, or a weak attempt at being 'lol wtf gross' (the pig guts trap - lame). The final trap - The Rack - is very good, on the contrary, boasting the dark, tortured genius that we all know the SAW films can pull off, and it's a shame they only really let loose for 5 or 10 minutes out of the whole movie.<br/><br/>You could say that SAW 3 focuses more on the plot with Jeff and his crisis and all, but that's crap, these movies are torture horror films, and there's no point in watching them aside from seeing the cool traps and watching people die. They're like the cyber generation's Friday the 13th saga, as much as Leigh Whannel wants to jazz things up and make this movie seem better than it actually is, with the fancy Hollywood gloss and polished-to-the-brim special effects (that lose the charm and allure of the more savage, primal ones from the first movie, also). SAW 3 is far, far too pretentious and takes itself way too seriously. This is a neutered film that lacks the power and raw, unbridled anger and conviction of the first one, and it's a damn shame, although it was certainly bound to happen sooner or later.<br/><br/>The plot is a bit of a departure from the more pugilistic and straightforward ones in the past two movies, and this time we get a much healthier and stronger dose of moral goodness stuffed down our collective throats. This kind of thing was always cheesy, but here it's taken to absurdly dizzying heights, and I can't even take it anymore. In the first two movies, we got some similar ideologies, but never were they as fleshed out as they are here, and never were they as cliché and boring as they are here. In traditional SAW fashion, though, the final 20 minutes of the film are quite gripping and endearing, and at least the ending of this one is far better than the ending to the previous sequel, and I doubt most people expected it to end this way. There are indeed good things to be found here, but the problem is that they're buried beneath a rather sterile, pre-processed horror movie, a film that relies too much on special effects and trying to gross us out. I did give it a 3/5, though, as this movie is still genuinely watchable and on-par. It's just a severe disappointment."
"gutoistheman","5","1","2","3 September 2007"," It's not clever!
","Just finished watching this film, and as I knew the stories for the first two, but didn't watch them, I am not a fan of the series, I'm just reviewing this film as a film on its own. <br/><br/>The first scene makes you cringe, but the rest of the film doesn't. Everyone was telling me how sick this film is, but after the first scene... I just thought it was a wasted movie. <br/><br/>I am not a fan of blood and guts in movies... but it didn't make me sick watching this film! And also... It's not clever! The main story is pointless! I hated it and can't understand how you can like a film like this!<br/><br/>Awful, Awful film. <br/><br/>Gore is not cool."
"lodewijkpollemans","8","1","2","27 July 2007"," Impressive modern gorefest
","Before you go see this movie, just realize this is nót the 'thriller with horror-tendencies' like part one was. This movie brings a lot more gore to the screen (flesh is being ripped, ribs are pulled out, arms and legs are twisted) and manages to beat part 2 in terms of sickness, and thus becomes the goriest film of all 3. Is that a bad thing? Not for me.<br/><br/>Saw III starts off slow (even though with already a few tortures), but as soon as you see Jigsaw and Amanda again for the first time, you know this movie isn't going to disappoint. This time, the tone is much more put on the tortures itself, rather then the actual murder. And thats one of the things that makes this movie interesting to watch, because it never leaves you bored.<br/><br/>My first guess was that part 3 of Saw was going to progress more into the typical cliché psychological horror-thriller thing with stuff you've seen already. But instead the creators aimed more for a more hardcore horror-audience, with obviously more violence and gore, and even a hint towards the horrorclassic Hellraiser. And gore and violence is not the only thing that this movie presents; it also unvolds a clever plot as the story develops towards the end of the movie (like only a movie like Saw can deliver).<br/><br/>Even so, it has to be said that you have to be a Saw-fan to fully enjoy this, or at least a fan of the genre. For those who aren't: leave out your lunch before watching this movie."
"Antagonisten","5","1","2","10 July 2007"," The charm is waning
","Sequels are a funny thing (or a tragic thing, depending on who you ask). It seems that the formula for sequels in Hollywood is ""more is more"", not ""less is more"". So with SAW that formula equates sicker traps, sicker games and of course more blood. In that regard, the third movie is a completely logical step.<br/><br/>What i liked about this movie is the whole set that they have built. It's a really disgusting warped reality with rotten pigs, disgusting smells (i imagine) and plenty of rooms with sick games. This time two people have been kidnapped for apparent and not so apparent reasons. The formula is basically the same, although the characters are beginning to reach the end of their arc. Amanda is obviously deranged and Jigsaw in worse shape than ever. Also that's one of the things i found quite admirable, that the film-makers were actually able to keep any interest in what was basically rather simple characters to begin with. Sure, Jigsaw had a motivation and an idea, but that didn't exactly make him three-dimensional. But here i find myself actually caring what happens.<br/><br/>What i didn't like so much was that the level of disgusting effects and gore has been turned up another notch or two. Most of all i felt it was quite unnecessary. The amount of blood in the first movie was quite enough, the amount in the second movie was pushing it, and here it's excessive. I guess most of the audience (at least the real fans) won't think so though, so i understand why they do it.<br/><br/>This is not a bad movie. It's not as entertaining as the first two though. Mostly because the charm of the concept is really beginning to wane. I would say that this should be the last movie in the series, but i know that there is already at least one more film in the making. I doubt that i would watch that one though, to me the SAW-franchise has been milked enough (and then some) after this movie. I rate this 5/10."
"Tolbert","8","1","2","9 July 2007"," Great Movie, Right up until the end.
","I just viewed this for the first time the other night. I had seen the first two.<br/><br/>I loved the first one, a true masterpiece for the Horror Genre and one that'll always stand alone. No matter how many Horror flicks you've seen, the first one has major originality. They did quite a few things that hadn't been done before and did other things that had been done but did them better.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the second one but not nearly as much as the first one.<br/><br/>****Spoiler Time**** Killing Off the cop: (Dina Meyer) Big Mistake! She played such a small role in the other two, they barely had enough time for character development. Breaking John's tradition of giving someone a ""way out"" even if it was profoundly difficult was also a mistake. Then there's the underlined thing here, I must confess that I'm a guy and like other guys out there, we hate seeing the hot woman get all messed up like that. She must like dying in a gruesome fashion in movies (Starship Troopers, Saw III). Don't worry Dina, someone out there will feel bad like me and resolve not to let you die off like that! Amanda: Huh? What? I'll admit she's not the most likable person in this one. In fact she was rather irritating. She's such a Nut Job in this one that it's kind of a relief to see her get whacked at the end. I just wonder why they bothered to kill her off right then and there.<br/><br/>John: Last but not least we get to Jigsaw himself. Why did they bother to go to all the trouble to save him just to kill him off too? I think this could have easily been good for one more sequel if not for that.<br/><br/>One last critique here: (***Spoilers Again****) The two plot twists: The bit with Amanda and The bit with the Jeff just really seemed tired and unnecessary. Maybe one of the two would have been both but in this case more just wasn't better. I think they could have done without one of them.<br/><br/>Now with all that in mind, this was a good movie. I really enjoyed the new traps and the new goodies they had. The last one they showed was particularly ingenious, gruesome but ingenious. The twisting of the mechanisms was particularly hard to watch.<br/><br/>I hope they're able to pull off Saw IV."

"zardoz-13","2","1","2","13 June 2007"," Where Do The ""Saw"" Movies Go From Here?
","The new horror chiller ""Saw III"" wraps up the bone-grinding, blood-sodden, Grand Guignol torture trilogy with an unimaginative, convoluted ending that suggests mankind prefers to kill rather than forgive each other for their crimes. The original ""Saw"" (2004) qualified as a provocative but unsavory white-knuckled exercise in surprise, suspense, and sadism that established new standards for fright films. Its clever but lackluster sequel ""Saw II"" (2005) degenerated into a stylistic but repetitious drill in suspense and sadism with more sophisticated deathtraps minus the visceral quality of its brilliant predecessor. ""Saw III"" sinks far lower than ""Saw II"" in its pretentious commentary about mankind's murderous penchant for mayhem. The latest installment literally scrapes the bottom of the barrel in a slaughterhouse of stellar special effects that don't so much frighten as sicken. Mind you, if the sight of a man trapped at the bottom of a giant vat as the ground-up, liquidified remains of maggot-infested pigs nearly drowns him strikes you as amusing, then you'll crave this obnoxious, nihilistic, below-average sequel. Unhappily, those who demand interesting characters and/or victims, intriguing plot twists and turns, and an ending that delivers a slam-bang, up-beat send-off will condemn ""Saw III"" as both predictable and pedestrian. Worse, if you missed the first two ""Saw"" movies, a lot of the storyline—several flashbacks about the first two films—may strike you as incomprehensible.<br/><br/>Scenarists Leigh Whannell and James Wan, who co-scripted ""Saw,"" have written an elaborate morality tale about the futility of revenge. Not only is the notorious Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) playing lethal games with a fresh batch of hapless victims but also he is testing his homicidal apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith of TV's ""Becker"") who wants to carry on his serial slaughtering ways. The plot whirls on where ""Saw II"" shut off. Ex-junkie Amanda dons a dead pig's head and kidnaps all the cops from the first sequel and sticks them in various bondage contraptions designed to kill them. Again, if you skipped the first two ""Saw"" sagas, most of these early scenes will baffle you. Of course, coherence and credibility aren't important where most horror movies are concerned. Horror movies are designed to make you scream, and the torture devices that Amanda claps these poor slobs into will make you shutter at her callous disregard for life. For example, the corrupt, evidence-planting ""Saw II"" cop finds himself shackled by the leg and left to die in the same grungy toilet from the first movie. Instead of cutting off his ankle with a rusty hacksaw, he smashes his foot so thoroughly that he can slip the mangled remains out of the shackle. Afterward, things get progressively worse or, depending on your repressed sadomasochistic tendencies, progressively better.<br/><br/>In ""Saw II,"" the anti-heroic Jigsaw was in bad shape as a result of his inoperable cancer. In ""Saw III,"" he spends the entire movie on his death bed and suffers from horrible headaches. He dispatches Amanda to kidnap an emergency room surgeon, Lynn (Bahar Soomekh of ""Mission Impossible 3""), to relieve his headaches by boring holes into his skull. Mind you, it isn't important that anybody could survive this kind of surgery and still be as fiendishly clear-minded as Jigsaw is. Of course, poor Lynn finds herself in the unenviable position of performing surgery with a steel collar encircling her neck. Amanda has designed Lynn's noxious necklace of sorts and equipped it with firing mechanisms loaded with .12 gauge shotgun shells. If Lynn errs during her operation on Jigsaw, the killer's life-support systems will trigger those devices, blowing the surgeon's brains to bits. Meanwhile, Amanda has abducted another unfortunate character, Jeff (Angus Macfayden of ""Braveheart""), who has been suffering ever since a motorist killed his son. Jeff has neither recovered from his grief over his son's accidental death nor his contempt for a legal system that let his son's killer off with a light sentence. None of the unredeemable characters in ""Saw III"" learn the lesson that it is better to forgive and forget rather than destroy.<br/><br/>The violence is ""Saw III"" surpasses anything from the earlier ""Saw"" movies. In fact, it makes ""Hostel"" look like child's play. Unlike ""Hostel,"" however, nobody survives ""Saw III."" Sophomore director Darren Lynn Bousman, who helmed ""Saw II,"" and Kevin Greutert, the editor on all three ""Saw"" films, display their technical mastery for staging brutal scenes and condensing details. Indeed, ""Saw III"" benefits from top-notch production values and superb visual blood and gore effects. Although it is a malevolent, raw-edged crime/ horror thriller with virtually no redeeming thematic value, the filmmakers have done a brilliant job of showing us some frankly far-fetched stuff. The scene where Lynn removes a chunk of Jigsaw's cranium with power tools stolen straight out of Bob Villa's home repair workshop is an assault on both the eyes and the ears.<br/><br/>Ironically, the people who wrote and directed this devastatingly mean-spirited melodrama appear to have carved themselves into a corner. Although they were able to create a sequel to the original film and its initial sequel, the chances of a sequel to ""Saw III"" look pretty remote. The ""Saw"" movies have never been about the supernatural thrills and chills, like either the ""Friday the 13th"" or ""Halloween"" flicks, so it will be interesting to see how they will contrive ""Saw IV?"""

I still don't know how I survived that day, since when I watched it again in my own living room, I was scared I had to turn it off.<br/><br/>The most disturbing scene in the entire movie, is when Jigsaw captures the Female cop and makes her go through the most gruesome game in the history of the Saw Trilogy. The trap was hooked onto her rib cage. The only key to unlock it was in front of her. Sounds easy right? Think again. The key is in some fresh acid, which easily dissolves ones hand. After a series and of screams and shrieks, she puts her hand in the acid.... and thats when I couldn't take it. Her hand had no chance, but she luckily got the key. But due to certain circumstances in the movie that I am not going to spoil, she ends up getting her rib cages ribbed out of her body, and instantly dies a terrible and gruesome death.<br/><br/>Grasping the handle of my chair and the hand of friend, I moved on to more gore. To pigs guts and insides spraying over the judge, to the naked women turned into an icicle from freezing to death. Then later to a man getting his arms, legs, and head twisted so much, they broke off his body.<br/><br/>Yet, I will criticize this movie. Read the title, it left no room for Saw 4, and I just recently learned that one was to be made. But. how can it? John and Amanda died! Who will take the role of Jogsaw in the upcoming film? Makes no sense and the creators of Saw just should of stopped and make this a trilogy, and not ruin it.<br/><br/>9/10, doesn't deserve any higher."

","after watching this one, i have to admit that i was lost for a little while, till i started piecing together all ofhte twists and turns that saw III has to offer. i liked the traps especially in this one, they were without a doubt pretty dam clever. it was good to see jigsaw back in action, amanda was way more evil in this one i thought, i especially like the scene with the four pigs, that was pretty cool i must say, overall i th ink that this one does some explaining from the previous two movies, tying together saw 1 and 2 very well, although there are still some loose ends in my mind that need to be tied up, i don't think this one was as good as the first saw, but sequels are so hard to be better than the original, but it was a dam good ride."
"drnrg31","9","1","2","6 May 2007"," Great movie, but a little too dark
","..and by dark I mean the way it was filmed not content. I give this film a 8, only because the original SAW was perfect ,thus making this one one notch lower.<br/><br/>First of all, for all those of you who so horrible turned in disgust, This movie is not made for PANSYS like you. Go watch A comedy.<br/><br/>Second; for all of you think the movie is not credible. So What! You go to the movies for entertainment, in other words to see things you would otherwise never get a chance to see. You want realistic? Watch a Home movie instead. This comment is especially for those who ask ""where are the authorities"" Boo Hoo.. If you watch SAW 2 ,then you know that ""JigSAW"" and Amanda can get to anyone at anytime. inlcluding the authorities.<br/><br/>With that aside ,this is a great film. Gory to the max? Maybe not so much, but it does attain that effect with bone crushing and flesh tearing sound effects. A good improvement for the series.<br/><br/>The story line is very good, because this time around the victims do not soley rely on themselves for salvation, but rather on other people's actions: For those of you too ignorant to grasp the concept of needless killings, I'll explain it to you. The reason most of the victims were doomed in this installment is because ""Jigsaw"" was not fully in control, but rather passed on the torch to Amanda, who is even more twisted than ""JIGSAW"" She somehow blames the world for her state of mind and seriously believes that no one changes after they are given that second oppotunity. She of course, bases this belief on her own life.<br/><br/>The second plot involves a father, Jeff, who is so consumed with hatred over those responsible for his son's death, that he would rather let them die right before his eyes. Including a witness , The man responsible and the judge in the case.This rules out senseless killing of innocent people. Finally there is Lynn, who because of her failing marriage turns to adultery to satisfy her needs. Sound familiar? Does Dr. Lawrence Gordon ring a bell.<br/><br/>So once again ""JigSaw"" puts this sinners through a series of tests to prove if they appreciate the life they were given. ..And for the comment about these being innocent people. NEWSFLASH, Last time I checked WRATH and LUST were 2 of the 7 deadly sins, so in no way are these people innocent.<br/><br/>The tests this time around involve Torture devices that border medieval times, but are still fun to watch. Not at all for the squeamish.Also very important are the Flashbacks that explain missing puzzle pieces to the previous two films . All in all a very complete trilogy and a great way to end this saga. Oops too late. Part 4 is underway.<br/><br/>My only questions about the movie are? What really happens to Det.Eric Mathews? Other than a crushed ankle we are only told that Amanda left him for dead.Will we see his actual demise in part 4? and what of the poster scene were teeth are being pulled out? Or did I miss this when I went for popcorn? Somehow It doesn't fit into the storyline?<br/><br/>Final words: A great addition to the Horror genre. Who ever didn't like it or complained about gore and nudity, should really just not go see these movies. All you really do is waste time with your Pansy reviews."

","Dr. Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh) left for work, at the hospital, after an argument with her husband. She arrived there, saved a boy's life that couldn't breathe by doing surgery on him in the Emergency Room, never mind that she didn't wait for a surgeon, goes into a room, and pops some antidepressants into her mouth like they were candy! Then, she doesn't stay at work. Somehow, she ends up not knowing where she is, winds up at Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell), because he ""chose"" her to save his life, since he was on his deathbed dying with a brain tumor! <br/><br/>At this same time, her husband, ""Jeff"" (Angus Macfadyen), doesn't know where he is either, and he ends up at Jigsaw's, having to take a test, while his wife is to save Jigsaw's life! Something tragic had happened recently, with Jeff and Lynn, which caused them to argue and it was ruining their family life! So Jigsaw does a test, called ""Let's play a game,"" and if Jeff passes the test then everything will be all better, and if not, then it will be worse! <br/><br/>Jigsaw is aided by his assistant, Amanda (Shawnee Smith). She was also his test subject at an earlier time. She had passed her test and now she got to do Jigsaw's physical work for him. He had dragged her up out of the sewer holes of life, and she is so grateful to do whatever he wills her to do. She even gets jealous over him with Dr. Lynn Denlon! <br/><br/>I won't tell you what happens or how it ends, since I don't like to do spoilers, but this has got to be the worst ""Saw"" movie yet! If you like gore, it's very bloody and gory because Jigsaw's games are all about torture, of course. But the most torturous part is having to sit there and watch it all the way through! It flips through flashback scenes all the way up until the end. The whole time, it keeps you wondering, ""Is this happening now or is this what already happened?"" <br/><br/>The best part about the whole movie is at the end, when it's over! And the way that it ends, there shouldn't be a ""Saw IV,"" in my opinion. But you never know; Jigsaw could just, at will, want to play another game. The best part of his game, in this movie, is when he says, ""Game over!"""

","The internal logic of this movie will not let you down. If you can stomach the grotesque imagery then this dark twisted romp will satisfy in the end.<br/><br/>The film makers have returned to Jigsaw's name sake and put together a puzzle that fits together very nicely. Once again Jigsaw seems to have a twisted code of ethics which got lost in the second movie. He states: ""I hate murderers and do not condone murder"" And by the end of the film we can believe he meant it.<br/><br/>Like many recent horror films (The Descent, 28 days later) this film doesn't insult the intelligence of the viewer but rather tells a good story with believable characters. If you are a fan of the horror genre, then don't miss this movie."
"culmo80","6","1","2","1 April 2007"," Not as good as the first 2
","When you watch the first two Saw films, you are actually surprised by the big twist at the end of the film. In this film, it's more a ""hmm"" moment and then you begin to pick apart the ending as it is the not as well-thought through as the previous films.<br/><br/>With the previous two films, I empathized with the characters caught in the games. Not so much in this one. I became annoyed with the guy because he was so slow to act and he moved around like he wasn't in any hurry. Maybe that was the intent; to make you want him to get what happens to him in the end. Even the doctor wasn't someone I felt any empathy for and as I said, the big twist really didn't shock me, at least not like the twists from the first two films.<br/><br/>Now, there are some good points to Saw 3, such as revisiting the setups to the games played in the first Saw. I was surprised to learn that Amanda had been with Jigsaw for those. And it was interesting to see what happened to Eric from Saw 2. This Saw also has some of the most gross scenes of the whole trilogy...Jigsaw's surgery and the judge nearly drowning in pig guts top them all.<br/><br/>Saw 3 is worth your time if you've seen the first two films and liked them. This one definitely has some of the sickest scenes as I already said and you'll appreciate seeing a little ""behind the scenes"" of Jigsaw's earlier games. You won't remember this as one of the greatest horror films though...it's not up to the standard of the first 2 Saws."

","And there was me thinking he'd probably be a labrador, or a small goat. It's bad dialogue, though surprisingly it's not the worst offering in this tired, repellent sequel.<br/><br/>I was shocked to discover that the writing team is exactly the same as it always was through all three movies, meaning that the same hands that were behind the inspired and original Saw are responsible for this repugnant dross. As Darren Lynn Bousman was behind the first sequel - which was also inferior, though nowhere near as bad as this - then it's possible that it's his direction that kills it. Certainly he's not able to get a decent performance out of Angus Macfadyen, or give us characters to care about. His obnoxious jump cut cinematography only serve to distance the viewer from what's going on in the fiction of the piece.<br/><br/>Whereas once Saw was about the inventiveness of the situation, here it's just about the grotesqueness of the mutilation. Borderline misogynist at times, there are even traps with no escape, just a high level of blood count. The news that a fourth film with Bousman but with new writers is in pre-production is sad news indeed. The original Saw was a striking movie, but sadly the $ talks, and more of these will continue to be made, to ever decreasing returns..."
"silkandskin","3","1","2","6 March 2007"," Diasppointing
","After the ingenious Saw, and the breakneck Saw 2, comes Saw 3. Following the separate story strands of Doctor Lynn (Bahar Soomekh), who must keep a dying Jigsaw alive, and Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), who is trying to avenge his son's death, the film is guilty of severely diminishing returns.<br/><br/>The attempts to inject this series with some 'human drama' falls flat with a collection of unlikeable and stupid characters, and the pacing is flabby. The gore, which used to be inventive and fresh, is now just nasty and gratuitous (the chest scene being a particular lowlight.) The tension that made the first film so good is nowhere to be seen, with the film providing none of the shocks and jumps of say, the camera flash scene of Saw. Instead we are 'treated' to a series of genuinely repulsive torture traps, each one more revolting than the last. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of the original, and even quite enjoy the second, but this just left a nasty taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>The final scenes wrap the series up relatively cleanly, and I would like to say that this was the end of this rapidly decaying franchise, but with Saw 4 already in development for an October release, I think Jigsaw will be playing games with us for the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>Get ready for a lot more blood..."
"DiscoViolento","4","1","2","4 March 2007"," Better than both Saw 1 and 2, but...
","During the time I was watching this movie, I was fidgeting in my seat almost the whole time.<br/><br/>Because it was scary? No. Because of the five billion ways of torture that is visualized. Not really.<br/><br/>To me, Saw has become a series that walks back and forth in its own footsteps; trying so desperately to shock that it fails. This time it's ten times the gore and ten times the pain and somehow I feel that it overshadows the good part of this movie - the parts that makes it a bit different from the other two.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the usual ""hey ho, Jigsaw's killing again"" where different kinds of funky ways to kill a person are displayed. This is basically just a gore fest which doesn't bring anything to the movie except for being simply that. Gore.<br/><br/>This time, Jigsaw (with help from Amanda) kidnaps a nurse, who is meant to help him survive while he's helping some other poor, lost soul finding meaning in life. Truth is, I enjoyed watching the conversation between the three of them far more than the actual process of the game. Most of the time I was simply wishing for the movie to speed up a little because watching a man deciding what he should do for several minutes is hardly entertaining; at least not in this kind of movie.<br/><br/>I won't say it's all bad. In fact, it's better than both the first and second one. Why? First of all it has character development. An important element which was slightly forgotten in Saw 1 and, mainly, Saw 2. Secondly, the plot is better. People's reasons for doing certain things are more logical and they put in a couple of unexpected twists which makes it a whole lot more interesting. The third reason is that the actors are better. Saw 2 was, in my opinion, a disaster in that area and thankfully they seemed to pick their actors more wisely this time.<br/><br/>Despite all the efforts to make the characters human, this movie bored me. Most of the time it felt like nothing really happened, despite the makes of the movie actually moving the concept up a notch.<br/><br/>The problem with Saw is that the unexpected becomes expected and when a movie depends upon it as much as this movie does, it just ends up being boring and predictable.<br/><br/>But if you can get through the first 20 minutes of utter blah, you have an interesting movie that, unfortunately, is slightly ruined by the fact that it is too similar to the older, less good, ones."
"david-binder","10","1","2","29 January 2007"," Saw III ramps things up to a conclusion that manages to tie all three movies together.
","The entire series has been surprisingly strong. The first film had the element of mystery and surprise. The second ramped up and fleshed out the Saw universe, while the third manages to tie all three together and come to a great conclusion. The traps are more elaborate, the games more convoluted and the blood runs heavier.<br/><br/>The only thing that's curious is that there will be a fourth Saw. How they can do that when they have effectively wiped everyone involved out makes me wonder. Sometimes it's best to quit while you're ahead and Saw III is definitely ahead.<br/><br/>I'll have to see Saw IV when it hits this fall, but more out of curiosity than any realistic expectations."
"terri7199","5","1","2","29 January 2007"," You can't be serious
","While technically well made and very good in terms of special effects, the Saw series is that one unforgivable in movies; it's boring. Someone else gets tortured, someone else gets murdered, someone else gets in a situation where they have to mutilate themselves or someone else to get loose. Same set up, variations on traps.<br/><br/>Over and over, without any reason for the viewer to care. Particularly in Saw II, there's no on to care about. The kid? He's a cardboard cutout with no character development, a cliché kid. The rest? Who cares what happens to them? I don't have to have a ""hero,"" per se, an anti-hero will do fine, just someone to care about. Not my cup o' tea."

","IF there's a plot here, I fail to see/understand it. I thought the first Saw was OK - interesting idea(s) and decent execution, but still not great horror movie.<br/><br/>Saw III lacks any sense of a plot - I was convinced that the Dina Meyer segment was a dream sequence as it had nothing to do with anything and almost literally goes by in a flash. I'm glad it was a free view - how can people pay US$10 to see this kind of trash? I would really like to understand how so many people here can comment that this was great or the best of the three? Did we watch the same movie? It's hard for me to believe that at all. It's also hard to believe that Amazon, er, the IMDb has such a strange way of counting ""lines"" and thus, making me add additional commentary when the simple summary I wrote originally should have sufficed.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time on this - read an old Clive Barker book - it'll be a better use of your time. I'd recommend ""The Books Of Blood""."

","Saw 3;; Jigsaw is back. The third installment picks up where the second left off, where we learned Amanda is part of Jigsaw's game. This time, she is appointed as his apprentice. This time, Jigsaw kidnaps a doctor to perform surgery on him in order to keep him alive, while Amanda kidnaps an unlucky man and puts him through an extremely twisted test.<br/><br/>I really liked the original Saw. I thought it was clever and atmospheric. Saw 2 retained a decent amount of the same elements while pumping up the gore factor. The problem with Saw 3 is how far it veers off course from the original two. Installments one & two had their share of gore, but didn't rely on the gore to make the movie. Saw 3 is all about gore shock-value. And I don't mean that in a complimentary fashion.<br/><br/>The plot literally feels like an excuse to string together a handful of shocking, gruesome death traps. The director has no intention whatsoever to keep the series ideas going, veering so off course, and paying so much attention to how much blood can spill and how many bones they can crack, you feel like you're strapped into a chair in an execution room, seeing person after person get brutally slaughtered.<br/><br/>Saw 3 does have it's strengths. The twist in the final sequence is surprising and satisfying, although it's an alarmingly weak set-up for the next installment. Acting is solid, and the film does have some creepy, well-done flashback sequences.<br/><br/>The beauty of the original Saw film was the gimmicky set-up was pulled off with ease. The second film had it's weaknesses, but improved on the plot of the original. The third film lacks focus on what originally made the Saw series a box-office smash. It focuses on what body part will get ripped off, burned, or torn apart more than it focuses on plot, direction or acting.<br/><br/>2 from 4."

I even rated all the death's in the movie from my favorite to least favorite.<br/><br/>1- Twist Machine Death 2- Rib Cage Machine Death 3- The Hook's Death (Hellraiser style!) 4- Girl Freezing To Death 5- Doctor's death (not the shot in the stomach but the Shotgun shell machine) 6- Jigsaw's/John's death 7- Adam's Death 8- The Judge's Death 9- Eric Matthew's Death 10- Amanda's Death<br/><br/>Another thing that helped the film was the fact that they went into complete detail on how they performed there game in the first film... As well as showing Jigsaw create the doll he uses in all his video's Etc.

"dee.reid","8","1","2","23 January 2007"," ""Saw III"" - Third time's a charm, isn't it?
","It was a few weeks before Halloween 2006 that I was able to get my hands on the uncut edition of ""Saw II"" (2005) and, boy, was that a nasty entry in this horror series. But the third film, ""Saw III"" is probably the best yet, following the first ""Saw"" (2004).<br/><br/>""Saw II"" is probably the series low point, with part III bringing it (presumably) to a breathtaking close. James Wan directed the first ""Saw,"" and Darren Lynn Bousman has been behind the camera for part II and part III. Leigh Whannell (Adam in the first ""Saw"") wrote the screenplay for this third entry.<br/><br/>Again like ""Saw II,"" the infamous Jigsaw Killer (the ever-creepy Tobin Bell) is out in the open, and so is his young apprentice Amanda (Shawnee Smith, who survived a reverse bear-trap device in ""Saw"" and whose true identity was revealed in ""Saw II""). This time, the terminally ill Jigsaw Killer has Amanda kidnap Doctor Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh) to operate on the ailing killer. The twist is, Lynn has a bomb strapped to her head and in the event Jigsaw flat-lines or she's out of range, well, she won't be having anymore headaches.<br/><br/>Lynn's horror story is paralleled with the plight of the vengeance-stricken Jeff (Angus MacFayden), whose young son was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver. Jigsaw has set up a tricks & traps funhouse that Jeff must make his way out of in two hours and in the process, face the demons of his vengeance. And thus, let the games begin.<br/><br/>Of all the ""Saw"" movies, ""Saw III"" is the most reflective, often drawing on the past two films to advance its plot and wrap up shoddy details from those films. What I have always admired about the ""Saw"" films is the excellent writing. If at all, I would just like to praise Whannell for one heck of a story. But the only thing that detracts from the ""Saw"" movies is some of the haunted house elements and occasionally uneven writing.<br/><br/>Like ""Saw"" and ""Saw II,"" ""Saw III"" benefits from its tripped-out editing, trippy score, and cinematography. The tricks & traps scenarios the filmmakers present us with get nastier and more grisly with each movie. Tobin Bell has been the central figure of the last two movies and his creepy performance is likely to rank as some of the best work of a screen serial killer.<br/><br/>It will be amazing if a fourth film is ever made.<br/><br/>8/10"

I liked so much the performance of Tobin Bell it was so realistic , suitable for the character , maybe some over calm but still great. Shawnee Smith was also great , and she made the best of her. Bahar Soomekh's performance wasn't quite enough for me, maybe because her character was actually so hard to act and needs a lot of hard work.

The ordinary people would at least loose consciousness when they are put through those kinds of things; obviously the people in the movie are extraordinary/super humans. I have felt pain and I know how the human body react to pain. Apparently those people haven't because they couldn't even act as if they were in pain. I got up three times and if the movie was a little longer I wouldn't have stayed till the end, which would've been the only mistake. I have to admit that the ending is very good and surprising (as any other Saw movie). I await Saw4; Hopefully it would be better and more realistic. :)"

","OK i have rated for this movie 8/10. at the beginning, the movie was boring a little bit, but the twist at the end wow that was cool, real cool, why?? 1- Jigsaw tested Amanda 2- Jigsaw tested that other guy twice ( i forgot his name ) first test to save the witness, judge, and that other guy i forgot his name actually. and the second test (forgive or kill ) and he chose to shoot him, so, that let his wife dead.<br/><br/>but what i don't get it is: how are they going to make saw4 if Jigsaw & Amanda are dead ??? if Amanda is going to be alive at saw4, the movie will be a joke also if jigsaw is going to be alive in some magical, miracle or even a stupid way it will be a joke. you cant think of the script of saw4. only that guy is going to save his daughter. but the question still remains what happened to Dr.Gordon ?? we already knew from saw2 that Adam is dead - heck he deserve it - but Dr.Gordon ?? and his family.... OK another part of the movie. when that girl officer was killed by Amanda (( who was at saw2 )) well it is unnecessary. and when they have put Eric at the beginning well it was unnecessary either. another thing Amanda is too stupid to team up with jigsaw and sacrificing her self to him "" You will give me every cell that i need "" or something like that. Amanda said that the victims aren't learning nothing of jigsaws games, well Amanda you haven't seen them out of the cell to judge and actually i was happy when you were dead ( at script ) but you were great at the movie and i really like your acting part and your acting it self. now, about the surgery > how can u make a skull surgery or whatever the surgery was by one person it's impossible and the problem that jigsaw was alive after the surgery and he wasn't even screaming at the surgery and not moving either, well that's impossible. what i have liked about saw3 that there is no cops which gave the movie a little bit thrill more than action unlike saw2 it was action more than a thrill. i really enjoyed the movie at the end but we hope that the script of saw4 will be better and we hope that your not running out of ideas."

","Saw & saw 2 are two good films i think. The first one had a much better story than the second one, but the acting wasn't better in the second one. Cary Elwes doesn't really do it for me as a serious actor. Anyway. When i saw the second one for the first time i was pretty shocked. In a good way though :) So i was really looking forward to seeing this one!!! I went to the movies with my girlfriend the day after i showed her the first ones. She's not a horror-fan at all, but kinda liked them. We SAW the third one and she actually was angry with me after-wards. She didn't think the movie had anything but gruesome and pointless torture scenes. Me on the other hand had a blast. I could agree on that the story was better in the first two, but this did not disappoint at all. Can't wait for the DVD:) Hope they make the fourth even gorier:) HAIL HORROR!!!"
"Weisz_Man","9","1","2","20 November 2006"," Saw Wraps up tight.....can you find the key in time?
","Saw 3 does what most third installments don't do; it comes back at us with a tight script, super laden with mystery and yet despite all the loose ends that tighten, does not lose its power. Coupled with this are supreme images of ghastly terror within the modernized medieval type torture devices that we never get enough of.<br/><br/>Saw 3 picks up lightly where the 2nd one left off, but does not dwell there long. In this film, we're reintroduced to jigsaw yet again, but more of the focus is on his apprentice this time. Meantime, several characters, some strangers, some not, come into play. One of the ""key"" (no pun intended) members of this cast is Jeff (played by Angus MacFadyen). Jeff is apprehended by someone and soon finds himself in quite a predicament. The key (again, no pun intended) here is that unlike other victims of the vigilante/vengeance psychopath known as ""jigsaw"", Jeff is not shackled, bound or trapped. His quest is to take place throughout the industrial maze of brick, steel and cement landscape that has become a staple of ""Jigsaw"" hangouts. Jeff has not been paying attention to the family that needs him, but only because of hatred that has filled him over the loss of a loved one. Now he must play jigsaw's final game, to see if he can overcome his problems and in the process, simply survive the carnage.<br/><br/>Jigsaw's apprentice (Amanda, played by Shawnee Smith) has quite a past of her own as we soon discover. Despite the power you would think she would yield, we quickly learn how fragile all the seams of life really are. Saw 3 again shows great imagination and unique direction in the horror genre with such devices as the shotgun collar, attached body chains, ribcage reversal vest, the ice shower, pig guts vat, and another called ""the rack"". Jigsaw (played brilliantly by veteran actor Tobin Bell) has more tricks up the sleeve than you can shake a blade at. The writing of Saw 3 is superb as it intertwines multiple characters on a destiny soaked with death. The key again, is also its ability to not make to much of a puzzle of it as much as intertwine past events of the first two movies to make it come together with one final showdown. What will become of Jeff? What happens at Jigsaw's bed when the minute is up? Will the apprentice fulfill her mission or die trying? Gore Factor of this movie is a 9 of 10. At times Saw 3 is able to freak you out with its nailed hands, ripped skin and breaking bones. The humanity and irony that surrounds some of its more special parts is often drowned out with glimpses of complete carnage so gory that you just better hope you saved Dinner for later."
"mas_leo333","8","1","2","17 November 2006"," This should b 2
","The best compliment I can pay to this movie has already been said but I think I'll give my 10 cents worth. Saw 3 takes you mentally back to the atmosphere of Saw. The only thing good about 2 was the pimp character and without him would have been a flop.<br/><br/>But Saw 3 is Dark, gory and leaves you thinks of all the implications of the twist at the end. Which could never beat 1 but is pretty good. So its a shame that we now have to bid adjour to the Saw trilogy but please don't try to add onto 3. Unless you do a Prequel which is the rave right now! The saw trilogy will be remembered for bringing us some of the most innovative ways to torture since the 18 century. Thanks guys. I'm gonna lock my door tonight."

","i think saw III was a good movie, but WOW!!! What's with the pigs,,, OMG totally grossed me OUT!!! saw III was a good sequel to saw and saw II but i think the best one at of all the movies was SAW. saw II was okay but a lot of gruesome scenes. SAW III was good. The only thing I was not impressed with was the pigs, and the new traps that were invented by the psycho Jigsaw, but overall I would rate the movie a total of eight out of ten. i would like to say that if they have a saw 4 they should make the events less gruesome and bloody, that would reduce the amount of blood in the movie. LOL it's okay. Blood is what made the movie okay, and added more drama to it."

","It's incredible after the long wait see the third SAW and I get a a sad feeling.The blood was there the message of the squandered life a SAW special was there too but it just doesn't have the smart story that I expected from SAW now that it had all the money it needed all the bloody effects it could get,that being opposite to ""SAW I-The Bath from Hell"" as I and my friends call it which had low finances, all the money they had couldn't yield a good script.In this decade of trilogy I guess this will be the last of SAW but you never know maybe there will be a 4th Terminator and a 4th Lord of the R. or how about a 4th Matrix but don't bet on it."
"deathcabforcutie","3","1","2","14 November 2006"," Saw 3 is way over the top.
","When i first left the movies of SAW two years ago i was shaken. I loved that movie, it wasn't just a normal horror movie with some old guy with a chainsaw chasing after teenagers. It was different, smart with an amazing twist. I felt this way also about SAW 2 but it wasn't as great as SAW 1 but still good. When i saw SAW 3 i can say i was very disappointed and should have been expecting this. All SAW 3 is, is just a repeat of the other movies, a lot of sick games, you discover more behind the characters such as Jigsaw and there is a shocking twist. In my opinion SAW was a smart idea, a killer with the motivation to kill people who don't appreciate life and using their problems to link to their traps/deaths. I believe the makers of SAW should have STOPPED there. SAW 3 is not smart, all it is, is porn. For people who get off others suffering. And also to shut up people on the internet who keep going on about what happened to Dr Lawrence and Adam. I think no SAW 4 should be made. The SAW trilogy is just a dying animal refusing to die and it should be shot."
"midnightdelusions","10","1","2","13 November 2006"," Better than the first two.
","Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell return to their roles of Amanda and Jigsaw (John), respectively, for Saw III. Saw III, while perhaps not so much of a 'scary' movie, is certainly filled with lots of action and plenty of gore. There is also an added element: drama. The drama mostly revolves around the complicated triangle of Amanda, John, and Dr. Lynn Denlon (who Amanda kidnaps to care for John during his 'last stand').<br/><br/>Shawnee Smith is brilliant in the role of Amanda, a complicated character who is unstable both emotionally and mentally. Tobin Bell does an excellent job of reprising his role as Jigsaw. That fact that he spends 99.9% of the movie lying sick in a hospital bed means nothing; Bell pulls it off excellently.<br/><br/>Bahar Soomekh, who plays Dr. Lynn Denlon, is amazing. Her interactions with Amanda (Smith) are what make the film. Angus Macfadyen is equally good in his role of Jeff, the unfortunate victim in Jigsaw's final game.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is excellent. At certain times the movie seems to drag, but only because the rest of the movie is so fast-paced. There are plenty of twists (with one very shocking and unfortunate one at the end) and back-story galore. Not to mention, the storyline is superb. Smith, Bell, Soomekh, and Macfadyen all do excellent jobs at bringing out the depth and emotion in their respective characters.<br/><br/>Saw III is definitely the best of them, by far. With a Saw IV already being discussed, one is left to wonder how the writers will find a way to top its predecessor."

","Well, what can we say about this movie, apart from its great!! This is my first ever comment on here, but i had to make sure it was for saw 3! I only saw the movie today, but oh my life its amazing..i must admit, i think that one of the worst parts has got to be the trap which is called 'the rack' (i think so anyway) and when i saw that scene i was simply horrified by it! (Although i have to admit i also think it was great!) I also have to say that the trap was a bit too good for just 2 people to build, especially when one of them is dying (sorry for that but didn't know how else to put it). It has all the twists and turns that we expect and many more which is just great.<br/><br/>Also, i was thinking that there would definitely be another Saw, but after the ending of this one i aren't quite sure..for those that have seen it you will no what i mean but for people who haven't and wish to know, both jigsaw and his 'sidekick' Amanda die..so if there is another one i would like to know who is going to be the master of the cunning twists, traps and everything else..<br/><br/>For those people who haven't yet seen it, get yourself to your local cinema/theatre whatever you wish to call it, get yourself a ticket a drink and watch it! I would warn people to eat BEFORE they go to the cinema, not while you are there and don't expect to go to McDonalds after neither, as I'm not sure if your stomach will agree after watching this amazing film!! I absolutely loved it, and i would love to see another one!"

","NO, that was NOT a good movie. I am huge fan of Saw I & II, there was so many secrets, I had my mouth opened at the end of Saw II. But now? There was way too much gore. Yeah, there was a lot of blood and suffering in previous Saws, but that's not what I liked there. Like John said to Amanda ""Your games were unwinable"". She just thought Jigsaw's games are meant to end on death. Yes, some ""secrets"", as i call them, where revealed, but that was weak. I could watch Saw III without watching previous Saws and I would know what's that all about. I gave 10/10 for Saw I and II - there were just perfect, definitely my favorites, but Saw III just got 5 out of 10. Few days before watching it, I looked onto my myspace profile and I noticed there one thing: ""Favorite movies: Saw I & II, [...]"". I was so excited that I will watch Saw III soon, I was thinking about adding it to ""Favorite movies"" on myspace. But the true is that it was actually a bad movie and I'm sad about that. It was a film that I mostly wanted to go on this year. But I just got disappointed."

","Initially when ever there is a very original horror film any horror fan knows that sequels are not going to be as good, yet for saw the rules seem to have been bent. obviously if you want to see saw 3 you've seen the last two, and as original as they were, to enjoy saw 3 you must not expect an over blown powerhouse movie that the last two were, if you do you will not be impressed. to start out with saw is a thriller mystery, saw two was more of a slasher thriller with some mystery elements still in place, yet saw three really takes out the thriller and just becomes a slasher horror film. as i was sitting in the theater i was impressed on the all in all visual style of this film compared to the last two, saw three is an all out dark and macabre peace of art, yet compared to the last two witch were more on the side that made you think, saw 3 is pure visual, saw three is not as intense as the last two, but is for Sher make your date's tummy turn. With people saying that they hate it to people saying that its the best saw yet, all i have to say that it meshes great with the other films by being strikingly original in its own way, this movie is fun, grotesque, and if you want to be entertained for about 90 minutes i suggest that you go see this movie only with the knowledge that its not going to break the horror movie barrier or be completely visionary, have fun when you see this movie!"

The way Jigsaw's ""games,"" progress, they just get sicker and more sadistic throughout. I still enjoyed the movie but felt weak at the knees when leaving!

The new characters are interesting and seem real, as does Amanda as Jigsaw's new 'apprentice.' She really works it. The writers delivered yet again an exciting, layered script with other story lines and twists. Awesome.<br/><br/>The sad part is that the movie is longer than the first two and it is really noticeable.

"The_Wagon","6","1","2","6 November 2006"," The worst of the 3
","In 2004, Saw was released. It was a good movie, but it wasn't great. A year later, Saw II came out. It was a great movie! Definitely one of the better horror sequels out there. But, it seems like everything goes downhill with 3. Scary Movie 3 was a very funny movie, but not as good as SM1 or 2. Scream 3, Halloween 3, it's the same with a bunch of movies. 3 may be a magic number, but it rarely is with movies. Horror mainly. And that's true with Saw III as well.<br/><br/>Before I get to the good stuff, let's go over the bad stuff. The traps weren't that great. They all did the same stuff. They blew up stuff. One froze some naked chick, and another twisted this guy, and another one drowned people with freakin' pig guts! Another thing is that they went overboard with gore and blood. They showed a full naked body, they showed tons of blood, they even said a certain word that starts with a ""c"" and means the same thing as a part of the woman anatomy.<br/><br/>Also, the movie was too long. The other Saw films were pretty short. The first was about 100 minutes, and Saw II was 92 minutes. This is 107 minutes. Too long. An ultra gory flick like this only needs to be about as long as, well, Saw II.<br/><br/>That's the bad stuff. Next comes the good stuff.<br/><br/>Oops! Forgot another bad thing: TOO MANY OUT-OF-PLACE FLASHBACKS! Some flashbacks were needed, but others were flashbacks of stuff that happened in THIS MOVIE. They showed each flashback about 100 times.<br/><br/>Right now, I don't feel like naming the good stuff. I just hope they DON'T make a Saw IV. If they do, I'll rent it, but I won't spend 6 bucks on a movie ticket. Besides, Jigsaw's dead. I know they can write him in somehow, but he's dead.<br/><br/>Who knows, though? Maybe Saw IV will be good. Halloween 4 was better than Halloween 3."

","I can understand why people would be walking out and fainting from this film. And when I say ""people"" I especially mean the 15-17 years olds that shouldn't be seeing this film. I work at the cinemas, and I've never seen people walk out from a film because they felt nauseas. I've also never seen so many people leave to go to the ""toilet"" in the first half hour. This is almost definitely due to the first three scenes, which are all pretty non-stop violence, and they're needing to get out to have a break from it. I can't understand why this film doesn't have an R18+ certificate here in Australia. I'm 20, and I wouldn't be able to sit through all of those scenes. The most appalling, however, was a man taking his son aged around 11 to see it. This isn't allowed to happen with R rated films.

Saw 2 was not as good as the first, but still had it's moments... Saw 3 TOTALLY blows the first two out of the water! The irony (well, sort of) is that without the first 2, the third would make no sense (well, duhhhhh). Very rarely do sequels out-do the original, but Saw 3 kicks arse! Once again, the acting isn't brilliant, but it delivers a much darker and wicked movie. I only wish the first two had been made this way. It was indeed a very clever formula that made for an enjoyable, if at times cringeworthy (i mean the torture scenes and booby traps) 90 or so minutes. I loved it being a big horror fan, go see it....

","I did not come into this movie with any expectations whatsoever. If it was a bad third installment, well, we're getting used to them (Final Destination 3, Santa Clause 3). Well, this is one of the better endings to a trilogy.<br/><br/>In this sophomore sequel to 2005's Saw II, John Kramer aka Jigsaw is sick and near death. He is terminally ill, but apparently refuses to accept the fact. To keep him alive, Jigsaw and his protégé, Amanda, kidnap Dina, an anti-depressant-taking doctor in a crumbling marriage. Dina is forced to ""play a game"" to keep Jigsaw alive. As long as Jigsaw stays alive, so does she.<br/><br/>Angus MacFayden gives a magnificent performance as Jeff, a father who feels that he failed his family when his son was struck and killed by a drunk driver. He is also kidnapped by Jigsaw and put through a series of tests. At the end, Jigsaw promises that he will meet his son's murderer. Jigsaw's tests are about Jeff's morality and forgiveness.<br/><br/>With extra gory scenes of torture and decapitation, the third installment in the Saw series is by far the most graphic, but also the greatest. I was told that it had lack of surprise. This may be true, but the movie makes up for the lack of surprise with a surplus of suspense. It will keep you going until the end.<br/><br/>9/10"
"macvader999","6","1","2","5 November 2006"," worst of the three?
","I was so anxious to see this movie that I actually paid to watch it in the theatre rather than waiting for it to come out on DVD. The film had pretty much everything I expected: gore, gruesome traps, and a decent plot. But it didn't really have the surprise factor that made the first one so interesting. The third installment of Saw follows two main subplots. The first involves Dr. Lynn Denlon playing a game in which she must keep Jigsaw alive (he's not dead yet, just on his deathbed with cancer). The catch is she's wearing a shotgun collar that will kill her if Jigsaw dies or if she goes too far away from Jigsaw. The second subplot surrounds a man Jeff, who we learn lost his only son--he also has a daughter-- in a hit and run accident. Since the death of his son, Jeff has been obsessed with exacting revenge on the man who killed his son. Because of this, Jigsaw chooses him to complete a game I'll call ""forgiveness v. punishment."" In each phase of the game Jeff is presented with the opportunity to save (or if you will, forgive) someone who was involved in the death of his son (the only witness who fled the scene, the lenient judge, and finally his son's murderer). If Jeff completes his game successfully then the doctor will be allowed to go free. SPOILER: <br/><br/>In the meantime, the viewer learns that Jigsaw's protégé (Amanda) is actually just a bitch (seriously) and isn't really teaching people to appreciate life with her traps as Jigsaw does. In fact, the traps she creates are actually impossible to escape from. Overall, this movie made me cringe often (some of the traps and Jigsaw's partial brain removal were quite grisly) and for fans of disturbing horror movies I would definitely recommend it. Still, I was disappointed with the major plot twist (finding out that Jeff and the doctor are married) because in the beginning of the film you think that the doctor is married to the man she's actually having an affair with. In the opening scene he tells her that he wants a divorce, implying that they are married, but really he wants her to get a divorce from Jeff."

","It is perfectly understandable for the creators of Saw to incorporate this series into a franchise, focused on generating dollars at the expense of the quality of the product. What started out as innovative and genuine story telling, has deteriorated into the pool of bland horror flicks which it had distanced itself once before, and will only get worse the more they continue to generate (e.g. Hellraiser, Halloween and Friday the 13th).<br/><br/>Let us look past the fact that there was great anticipation preceding the release of this film. I'm sure that I'm not the only one that believed that this would be the end-all-be-all conclusion to the series and thus deliver the hardest punch to the cinematic world. To look at this film for what it is, it is just another horror flick sequel.<br/><br/>Despite the good acting, they could not overcome the bland script. What once were cruel but ingenious lessons on the value of human life, have now become exhibitions in death. There attempt to go out with a bang was a dud.<br/><br/>The first movie was great. The second one stepped it up like very few sequels can accomplish. The third installment took away everything that made the series stand out.<br/><br/>Good, but not as good as it could have been."

SAW 1 had the psychological edges, SAW 2 had the Gore, SAW 3 brought the best of both into one.<br/><br/>Indeed, SAW 2 was just really Gore, quite upsetting really, but SAW 3 made up for its predecessor's stuff ups.

","Hey, I happen to be a close acquaintance with director and writer Darren Lynn Bousman and would like to clear a few things up about the 3rd film Saw.<br/><br/>First off I don't know how much of you remember in which order scenes in the film took place but the tape which John (Jigsaw) pours hot wax onto occurs as Amanda informs him that Jeff has got past the 3rd test. Darren has plans to go into more detail about this in the fourth film, of course he isn't the soul writer but tells me that saw 3 has been made with an intention for a fourth and has been left with a lot of options to refer back to all three films.<br/><br/>I don't won't to ruin the fourth film for everyone so I won't go into much detail. In the fourth film you will get to hear what's on the tape, containing some very interesting info on Dr Gordon from saw 1. slightly bigger spoiler coming up so you've been warned...<br/><br/>As far as I have been told in the fourth Dr Gordon will be back and will be set as a prequel to saw 2 and 3. (a sub sequel to saw 1) Gordon will be involved in another one of saws games, working for saw NOT out of free will.<br/><br/>That is all I can think of for now, that and that there is plans for saw V to be set before, during and after the story of saw 3. Hope that helped at all, Any other questions just ask!!"

","The 3rd part of the trilogy comes to finish the story (or not?) of JIGSAW. I have never seen a better horror film in the past 5 years and I think the 'Saw' films will remain in history as ones of the best horror films EVER!!!To put the whole thing in a nutshell, in Saw 3 we've got it all again: blood, goosebumps and a great plot twist. Simply brilliant! Assuming that in the end of 'Saw 2' Amanda was going to take over, JIGSAW is still alive. This time though, he is quite sick and in need of an operation. Amanda is kidnapping a top surgery doctor to perform the operation while on the other hand there is always someone playing the GAME...While I was watching the film I was constantly afraid and I felt my heart ready to 'jump' out of my chest! If this doesn't make a horror film great then what?"
"blt_ftw","5","1","2","1 November 2006"," Barely there.
","This movie hardly met my (relatively low) expectations. It was more gory than the last two, but the violence seemed to be the only thing the movie was about. It seemed to me that they came up with some of the most violent and creative ways to torture/kill someone, and then wrote a storyline around it. The plot was compelling, but somewhat shallow and the ending was (as expected) open-ended. I left the theater irritated and wishing that I had saved my $8.50.<br/><br/>The acting was good, though one of the main characters, Amanda, got to be extremely annoying by the end of this film. Jigsaw's character was no different from ""Saw 2"", though by the end he was starting to sound like a broken record with his ""games"" and ""tests"".<br/><br/>All in all, it was entertaining to watch (it definitely made me cringe, squirm and freak out), but don't expect something that will blow you away, as it's lacking in most of the elements that make up an all-around good movie. Definitely doesn't have the charm of the original ""Saw""."
"Zekie","2","1","2","2 November 2006"," Not at all what I expected
","I absolutely loved Saw and Saw II. They were absolutely great, the games, the plot, the characters, absolutely great, even the acting was quite impressive, which is usually not the case in horror, gory movies.<br/><br/>However, Saw III left me not only disappointed, but also disgusted. I have observed my share of open-heart and brain surgeries, considering I am going to med school, I have absolutely no problem seeing guts, blood, any kind of injuries. I see them all the time. Needless to say I have no problem seeing someone being ripped open. I can't say that about Saw III. It made my stomach turn, which I guess, you would say, the movie succeeded in its goal. However, in the past movies, when Jigsaw played his game, he made it possible of a way out. There is no way out.<br/><br/>Basically, instead of having a plot, a story, with characters to make the story believable, it's just a movie of a fest of torture. I liked Saw because of the whole ""being ungrateful of your life"" and it has not followed the same paths in the sequel. I was in a big surprise and it wasn't a good one.<br/><br/>It was my first movie I walked out on within the first hour, not because it was too gory, but because it was not worth the $15 dollars I paid to watch something that has no plot, no believable characters, and is not anywhere near the original. I wouldn't waste my time nor money for this movie, unless you can get it for a dollar at the Box, if you really wondering what it's about, but even that's not even worth it."

","If you check out critic websites such as Rottentomatoes.com and read their reviews you'll see a lot of people who just don't understand the kind of audiences that enjoy these kinds of movies. I consider myself a hardcore horror fan, and even more so a lover of all movies. SAW 3 is not by any means worthy of an Oscar, but does fill the special voids that horror fans like myself have. It ties up all of the loose ends of the previous two installments and concludes rather strongly. Yes it is gory, yes it is violent, and no you're not going to be impressed with the intelligence behind the story. However if you liked the first two movies as I did, you don't care. With the SAW series, it's not really the events in the movie that are meant to scare you, but more so the idea behind every one of them. It's the idea that people don't appreciate their lives, and the whole philosophy about that which Jigsaw explains to us and his victims. That's what created the franchise's fan base. The gore is really just icing on the cake for enthusiasts. In short, if you liked the last two SAW movies then you'll like this one. If you didn't like them, then you just don't get it."

","I saw this film twice Friday night, and let me say, it blew me away. For some odd reason the second time around it was better, i caught a lot of things that i missed in the first viewing. The plot outline and story is outstanding and this is by far the best SAW to date. I only had to problems with this film... 1. Bahar Soomehk's performance didn't convince me, but she did a decent job and 2. Some of the traps were a little unrealistic... i can go for a box with razors that would cut your hands when you stuck them in, but some of the traps in saw 3 seemed a little unrealistic, for example, Kerry's trap... see the movie to know what I am talking about... over all great film and story.

"madmike7227","10","1","2","30 October 2006"," Amazing, with a few exceptions
","OK, I won't lie; sometimes I wonder how some sick demented person can actually even think of these plots and make money of them. It seems as if the only outcome if will be realistic re-enactments of what the viewers are seeing on the screen. However, besides the fact that it can give others sick ideas, it interesting. Any idea that seems to scare an individual while sounding intriguing because of its content will attract a person. Saw III is a perfect example; yea, its gory and disgusting but it kept me entertained and at the edge of my seat. I was dazzled by the things I was seeing and only could guess what would happen next. In my opinion, Saw III tops I and II together. Its the biggest twist yet and if you put all the blood and drills aside, it does have an overall moral thats hidden. If you're looking for an intense thriller that not only scares you, but makes you want to vomit, its the perfect movie. This my sound far'fetched but its true. Why do people want to go to haunted houses if they will only get scared? Its the same thing - entertainment. I can promise you that you will be satisfied walking out the theater and left contemplating about a possible Saw IV. If these movies are your type, Saw III will contend. Definitely a two thumbs up!"

It's puzzling! It's everything we loved from the first & second films. There actually were a few moments of sentimental value, which was surprising & revealing on Jigsaw's behalf but that made it even deeper & meaningful. I wish they showed exactly what was in Amanda's envelope but we really don't need to know, do we? I didn't like how they threw us off @ the beginning of the movie on who the DOC was actually married to but that's OK. I forgive 'em. I LOVED IT!

","This movie was the most well thought out movie I've seen in a long time. The way he brings the story together in the end is overwhelming. What made this movie good was not the terror, it was not the gore, it was the story. That is not to say, however, this movie didn't have gore. It definitely lives up to the standard of the Saw series in that factor, but the plot of this movie is what really amazes you. To create a movie like this requires a great imagination and Wahn and Leigh should be well credited. The direction was good too. Bousman allows you to have emotion for the characters in this film. You begin to have sympathy for some of the characters. The fact that a movie from the horror genre can achieve that is very admirable.<br/><br/>This movie is by far the best in the Saw series. It has every desirable feature you could want in a horror film. This movie is award winning quality. If there was one word I could use describe this movie, it would be ""brilliant."""

"slayer_of_the_jugga_phuk","7","1","2","29 October 2006"," Magnificent Film... but...
","I just saw Saw III in theatres, and from the first five minutes I knew it would be a good film. I'm a big fan of the first two, and I wasn't disappointed in the least. There ARE a few important things to hit on with this film, though. Some good, some bad, but I plan to show you why I liked the film, why people who liked and disliked the first two may like it, and why I can understand if you don't.<br/><br/>One) Saw III is GREATLY similar to the first two films, with the same feel, same atmosphere, and same style; however, it has a new, interesting concept in tack... Closure. I knew many people who shared similar interests in movies with me who absolutely hated Saw, as well as Saw II, for more than anything, a single reason. They told so little about how they ended up there, as well as why. Saw III tells you nearly EVERYTHING you've wanted to know. The only thing it doesn't reveal from my experience, unless I missed something, is what happened to Dr. Gordon. It also has a very dramatic, climactic ending to it that both humoured and horrified me.<br/><br/>Two) The Gore... Many people didn't even watch the first two in fear that they had immense gore. Well, the first didn't have nearly as much as it was rumoured to have. The second one had some, but done in a way that didn't seem to obvious with everything else that went on. Saw II got you a lot more with how shocking it was than what happened. Saw III... is twice as gory as the first two combined. I am a big fan of gore, when used correctly, and I can see many disturbing things, but this film made me look away and cringe at LEAST three times. It's graphic, and intense.<br/><br/>Three) The Plot. The Plot of Saw III is very well done, and very developed with very few questions like the first two had. While the first told you almost nothing about the story, and the second one told you only the bases of the main story, while giving you very little background on the characters, this one tells you nearly everything. It goes into why these things are happening, and how they all go together is very intriguing. If you disliked the first and/or second because it didn't tell you enough, watch this one. It may redeem the first two greatly, and turn you into a fan. The films are like a Puzzle, which is very expressive and symbolic of the trilogy's nature.<br/><br/>Four) The Ending. God what an ending. Sad, intense, dramatic, emotional, twisted, and brilliant. I can understand why some fans won't like this ending, at first I wasn't sure if I did, but after thinking about it... it couldn't be better. My only disappointment is that... it nearly guarantees the lack of a fourth installment. It closes off the series, but it's an amazing end to the Trilogy.<br/><br/>Saw III is a good film, but I can understand people disliking it. It's not a film that you HAVE to love or hate, but it probably will be. It'll either impress or disappoint you."

","I went see Saw 3 this past weekend, which I been waiting for all year long and expecting it it to beat the first 2 and my my was I right or what, this was just plain genius and amazing.The minute it started to the minute it ended I was just speechless, the gore, the suspense, o and lets not forget of course every Saw has a twist at the end, well this was one has 2 twist, which prolly is the shocked one of all at least in my opinion, despite the fact Jigsaw is in his dying bed, he takes it to a whole new level here, and you'll never see the ending coming. Well the whole movie starts off with Detective Matthews trying to escape which I heard he dropped out but I guess they just fooled us, and like always there something gore right in the beginning by twisting his foot off....ughhh lol. Then of course it starts off with investigating with Kerry, she gets herself in a trap, has the movies goes on thats when the suspicion starts to come, Jigsaw kidnap's Dr. Lynn and in order for her husband and her to survive she must save Jigsaw but the device she wears around her neck is a neck collar that controls Jigsaw's heart rate which means if he died it will go off and blow her head off, wow huh lol, but like always the ending happens with the twist that I never saw coming, not spoiling nothing here but you have to listen to Jigsaw again in this one to get the ending....anyway this was definitely worth the watch and it beats the first 2 Saw's. 10/10"

The second was nicely structured and dug into the plot nicely. Though this third installment was a slight let down. I enjoyed it... and it did serve most of its purpose. Though many moments during the film I didn't feel like i actually needed to pay attention. A few things seemed irrelevant and slightly random (though were cleared up later), that didn't immerse me in the action as the other films did quite fine. The plot that had increased in flavor in the second Saw, was watered down during this Saw. The gore seemed forced at some moments and not as ""thought about"" as the other films, but it did work in making me feel uneasy...ish.

","OK, let me start by saying that this is without a doubt the best ""Saw"" movie of the three, and possibly one of my favorite movies of all time!!! There's just SOOO much to love about it: the great acting (especially Tobin Bell, who chills you to the bone), the relentless pacing, the crazy traps, the magnificent story (yes, story in a horror movie), and the gruesome gore! Hell, we even get a shot of boobs. Nice!<br/><br/>*Mild Spoilers* <br/><br/>We get some good characters back from the previous two movies, like Donnie Wahlberg as Matthews and Leigh Whannell as Adam. It shows a lot more of what was done to Adam and what ended up happening with Detective Matthews. THERE IS NO DR. GORDON IN THIS MOVIE! I personally wish there would have been, but the simple fact is that he is not in this movie, so let let all the asshole low-lives on the board fool you with those COMPLETELY FAKE endings they're making up. But anyways, this movie is just an all-out blast. The only thing I'm missing is the big twist that we've some to expect with the ""Saw"" movies, although I have absolutely no problems with the ending and thought it was very strong. if I remember correctly, the total body count is about 10, including Adam, although we already knew he was dead, it just showed us exactly how it happened.<br/><br/>Bottom Line:<br/><br/>Saw 3 is a relentless, gruesome helluva ride that never cuts away, even when bones are snapping and ribs are being ripped out. It's anchored by great performances all around and by-far the best Jigsaw traps we've seen. It's the most gruesome, sadistic, smart, disturbing, and entertaining in the Saw trilogy and possibly my favorite movie ever. Even if you're not a Jigsaw fan, you're missing out BIG TIME if you pass this one up. This one is a MUST to the highest degree!!!"

"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","7","1","2","27 October 2006"," Disturbing and powerful...exactly what you expect from these films
","*BEWARE THERE ARE SPOILERS TO SAW AND SAW II IN THIS REVIEW...NO SPOILERS TO SAW III, BUT SPOILERS TO THE FILMS BEFORE IT*<br/><br/>I've been waiting for this film since I watched Saw II. First off, I must say that it doesn't disappoint true fans of this series like myself. While Saw II was a good film, it didn't even come close to the original. Saw III is an even better film, and comes a lot closer to matching Saw I, but it too is not at the same level. Darren Lynn Bousman's direction behind this film is very well done again, and I'm very glad he stayed around to direct both sequels. The best part about this film is that Leigh Whannell AND James Wan, the original minds behind the epic trilogy, are back and in top form as the helm the story and screenplay. While telling you the plot line in detail is a gigantic slap in the face to you, the reader, I'll give you the basics of it.<br/><br/>Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is dying. Things don't look good for him as his cancer is beginning to catch up with him more than before. His apprentice, Amanda (Shawnee Smith) is following all his orders, taking care of a few victims every now and then. Her next task is to get a doctor, namely Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh of Crash), to keep Jigsaw alive for as long as it takes Jeff (Angus Macfadyen of Braveheart) to finish a series of tests. Lynn must be careful, because if Jigsaw dies, she dies. No question.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of these films are what makes them so psychologically powerful. The lighting, mood, and music define this series, as of course does the legendary villain Jigsaw. Darren Lynn Bousman has such an extraordinary vision for these films, and it is portrayed beautifully on screen...it just plain looks like a dark psychological horror film. Granted, this is not a film for the faint of heart. The gore in this film is near vomit-inducing, and I'm saying this even after the last film I saw before this was Jackass Number Two. Saw III makes its predecessors look like child's play compared to the blood and gore in this film, which will make you feel very uncomfortable at times. This, and the fact that it loses some realism throughout the film (which is one part of why these films are so good) are factors that keep it from getting a 10. The acting behind Saw III is also very well done. At last, all the main characters act near perfectly, especially Tobin Bell and Angus Macfadyen. Bell's John Kramer aka Jigsaw is easily the most fearsome villain of the past two decades. How this actor can make you know he's in control while being stuck to a bed is just inexplicable. He brings you in, and never, ever lets go. Shawnee Smith is good as his right hand woman, the secondary villain of the film. She can be scary at times, but nowhere near Tobin Bell. Angus Macfadyen's Jeff is a wonderful character, and he really takes advantage of this well-written character and makes it his own. A conflicted father is not really an original character, but this one is. Bahar Soomekh as the hostage doctor Lynn Denlon is very good. She is really a great actress, because we are always aware that she has some control over the situations because she holds Jigsaw's life (and of course, her own) in her hands, despite the fact that she's a hostage.<br/><br/>One element of Saw that is always present in all the films is the unpredictable twist at the end of the film. In the first film, Jigsaw arose from the floor between Dr. Gordon and Adam, a twist no one could have predicted. In Saw II, Amanda was revealed as Jigsaw's apprentice and heir-apparent. In Saw III...well, you'll find out for yourself ;)<br/><br/>SAW: 10/10 SAW II: 8/10 SAW III: 8/10<br/><br/>--spy"

This was given to them, but at a sacrifice in the plot. This story was very predictable, and it was easy to figure out what was going to happen in the ending. The plot follows two victims, a doctor and a father, who each have their different tasks. They both have their fair share of bloody and disgusting scenes.The plot doesn't explore any of the places it could have, such as deeper into the father's life, but for a horror/thriller movie, I guess it was expected.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting was iffy. The only decent actor was Tobin Bell, who I personally thought was great. The supporting cast(even Shawnee Smith) didn't meet up to the standards of the second movie.<br/><br/>However, this movie did tie up some loose ends from the first two movies very well, meaning, the first two movies made a lot more sense. I liked some of the traps (they still could have been better) but the movie just didn't live up to the Saw Series standards.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 5/10 (All I can say is they gave it a shot, and nice try)"

","In my mind the title ""SAW"" itself used to suggest the most astounding horrorific cinematic experience you could imagine from a horror and gory movie. SAW II lived up this expectation, but SAW II has failed terribly.<br/><br/>Any real SAW fan would be somewhat disappointed by SAW III. The pace of the story itself has deteoriates; where in SAW II the story progressed really fast and many things happened with multitude characters - SAW III is rather slow, unconvincing and sometimes offer chessy and lacking of solid story line and suspense.<br/><br/>Some gory scenes and tortures may moved my butt to the edge of my seat - but other than that, the story itself and the movie did not move me at all."

Well enough about LoTR. back to the Saw marathon. I fell in love with Saw 1 right from the the first 15 minutes to the point I couldn't believe my girlfriend who hates scary movies loved it as much as I did, thats a sure sign it was head and shoulders above any other scary movie out there. What a great way to build up the tension and suspension for saw 3 by showing all of them in a row. This one is fantastic. You'll love it.

Saw 2 did the same thing. It kept me on the edge of my seat; I am pretty sure I didn't blink the entire time. Saw 3 did it again, one of the only horror movies that really didn't disappoint me this year. Sure you can say that it is way too gory, and it is the downfall of our civilization to consider it entertainment, etc. Really, one has to appreciate what the kind people at Twisted Pictures have brought us. The Saw franchise has brought the viewer something that I believe no one has ever seen. The blood is only dyed water, and the marks on people are only makeup. As for people reenacting the Saw traps, everyone is so quick to blame the movie and not the person. I think it is funny how that works. No one ever complains about the violence in war or action movies, so why complain about this. I believe this movie to be a real must see for Saw fans, and if you don't like it don't complain. Just don't go see it, it is as easy as that."

"Coventry","5","2","7","16 December 2006"," Getting Jigsawwy with it...
","Jigsaw and his female accomplice Amanda, two sadistic serial killers with WAY too much free time on their hands, return in this third  and definitely not last  installment of the successful ""Saw"" franchise. It's just more of the same, really, only a lot grosser, as director Darren Lynn Bousman treats us to extended images of an open brain surgery as well as a wide variety of other stomach-churning scenes. ""Saw III"" is a really extreme and sick film, better not to be seen immediately after dinner, and a vast improvement over the mediocre second entry but still lacking far too many elements to be labeled as good horror. The script's main problem is that, exactly like with the first two, it tries to be overly complex and intelligent even though it totally doesn't fit the overall tone of the film. John ""Jigsaw"" Cramer developed into some kind of wise prophet with his endless speeches about the value of life and remission, but he's really just a pathetic old man who can't swallow he's terminally ill and the rest of his surroundings are not! Most people in this situation go into therapy or join internet forums, but instead John lethally punishes the people that too easily take their lives for granted. But according to him he's not a murderer! No, no...he even despises murderers. He simply ""tests"" people. Yeah right. Amanda, a former junkie whose eyes were opened by Jigsaw, assists the bed-ridden lunatic in his new diabolical plan centering on a female doctor who doesn't treat her patients tactful enough and a man who's confronted with the people that were responsible for his son's death. She needs to keep Cramer alive otherwise her head is blown up and he has to find the power to pardon the people who ruined his life or he'll die himself. The surprise & shock effect of the fist film have completely vanished, so you're not very impressed anymore whenever a character threatens to get killed by some type of inventively fabricated device. And there are plenty of those, for example one girl has to reach into a jar filled with acid to find a key that'll get the bomb-collar of her neck and one poor sucker is tied to a floor and flooded with pig-intestines! Gross!! Otherwise, ""Saw III"" is a rather lackluster film. It's roughly edited and very, very dark. Not talking in terms of atmosphere here, but just...dark! Lightbulbs apparently weren't included in Bouseman's filming budget and thus many scenes are just shot in the dark. For some reason, the character of Amanda (played by Shawnee Smith) also suffers from completely pointless flashbacks. It's an admirable attempt of our director to try and connect the three films together, but his intentions are too ambitious and his style too hyperactive. The tremendous amounts of graphic violence and blood was more than good enough for me. Oh yes, there WILL be blood."

Why the whole movie? to show me flashbacks? well,that's cool but where's the twist all in all ? He played a game for Amanda -that's cool but it was his third already ...he And now we get to the Jeff part -the fat man with a bad temper -so this guy basically had his son killed by some student -he tries to save the student ,the witness who saw the accident in which his son died but never confessed ,the judge that sentenced his child's killer to only 6 months in prison -he feels bad for them all -you can see that but ....he kills jigsaw -he cannot forgive jigsaw who basically didn't kill anyone dear to him ..hmm that's weird ...Jeff never observes the HUge collar around his wife's throat either -i guess there's nothing wrong with that either -hmm nothing funny happening . All in all ,i think this is the weakest of the ""saw"" series (almost forgot to mention the huge machines built for torture -by a woman with a lot of technical abilities i guess and an almost dead jigsaw who can hardly move ) >the twist if i can call it a twist is totally not interesting because you cannot feel anything about Jeff (Eric ,Adam and Gordon were developed nicely but Jeff will always be a fat man with a bad temper for me-maybe just the actor was bad -i don't know ) I give a 5/10 only because i liked saw 1 and saw 2 and i liked John in saw 3 too .

"Better_Sith_Than_Sorry","3","1","3","5 August 2019"," That's funny....why can't Jigsaw practice forgiveness?
","This third installment in the ""Saw"" series is full of pretentious, self-righteous nonsense that should have you begging for it to just end already. I certainly was.<br/><br/>Plot in a Nutshell: A dying serial killer forces a kidnapped doctor to keep him alive long enough to witness the outcome of his latest deadly 'game.'<br/><br/>Why I rated it a '3': Some reviews here made much of the idea that this film contains 'thought-provoking themes' and explores 'the philosophical aspect of forgiveness.' They are saying this, I suppose, because part of the plot revolves around Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), a man who has lost his son in a car accident and is unable to forgive the driver. He can't let go of his son and curses the fact that the driver 'got off light.' The serial killer ""Jigsaw"" has come to the conclusion that Jeff has not been grieving properly (yes this is as stupid as it sounds, and don't ask me how Jigsaw knows who Jeff is and how he is grieving) and so Jigsaw has determined that Jeff should endure a series of 'games' that perhaps will teach him how to forgive. As if Jigsaw has any moral standing when it comes to forgiveness! Here is a person who has sent countless people to their grisly deaths because of their perceived sins. Why couldn't Jigsaw forgive any of them, instead of setting them up to die? Hmm? Anyone? And now he's going to preach about forgiveness? Hey Jigsaw, how about practicing what you preach, buddy? Moron. Wow what a stupid plot line. Colossally stupid.<br/><br/>Coupled with this is a dreadfully uninteresting concurrent story about Jigsaw on the verge of dying (due to his terminal cancer). A doctor has been kidnapped and been forced to administer to Jigsaw with the challenge of keeping him alive at least until Jeff finishes his game. So the doctor must perform a crude operation with limited tools to get the job done and, if this sounds like it could have been part of a TV hospital drama, you're right. That's not a compliment.<br/><br/>As if all of the above isn't bad enough, it gets worse. How's that, you ask? How about if I told you that this film - which is supposed to be a horror film, right? - is in fact, a love story. I am not making this up. Here is a direct quote from the guy who wrote the screenplay, Leigh Wannell: ""It is a love story. It's a love story between Jigsaw and Amanda. Essentially they're like father and daughter."" Oh yeah? That's great. You know, when I'm in the mood for a scary horror film, there's nothing I like better than to have it centered on a good father/daughter love story! Gee, what should I watch tonight? ""Saw III"" or ""Father of the Bride?"" Wow.<br/><br/>""Saw III"" has all the markings of a film that was thrown together as quickly as possible to take advantage of the series' popularity. In other words, it's not good. It's not even average. It's bad. There is a scene where one character shoots another and Jigsaw admonishes - in all seriousness - 'you just ruined four lives.' Uh, what? How about all of the people Jigsaw has sent to their deaths in the first three films? How many lives has he ruined as a result of his actions? Does this self-important idiot even listen to himself? This is laughable. The writing here is so poor it's mind-boggling.<br/><br/>3/10. Would I watch again (Y/N)?: Never in a million years. Hell no."

","Moving the franchise into a trilogy, the third brutal torture horror film explains a bit more how Jigsaw pulls off the sick games while showing even more gore. The film begins with Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) breaking his leg in an attempt to escape captivity. Detective Kerry (Dina Meyer) searches for Eric but she also falls victim to Jigsaw's awful torture. The main story consists of John Kramer (Tobin Bell) and his pupil Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith) kidnapping a surgeon Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh) in order to keep John alive. Jigsaw wants to oversee one last game before he finally passes away so attaches a deadly necklace to Lynn's neck that has shotgun cartridges all around it and will go off if John's heart rate stops.<br/><br/>The test revolves around Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) who must go through a series of awful tortures. He lost his son in a drunk driving accident and has never recovered. His first test is to help the woman who witnessed his son's death, Danica (Debra McCabe), from freezing to death. She is hung up naked in a frozen locker and has water sprayed on her periodically unless Jeff grabs a key. He burns his cheek grabbing the key but doesn't save her in time. The next round is the judge who let the killer go, Judge Halden (Barry Flatman).

","Saw III is an amazing horror film, and one of my favorites! This movie has some of the best special effects I've ever seen! Also not to mention, some of the best traps in the entire franchise! They were gory and very abstract; my favorites were the Angel Trap, the Shotgun Collar, the Pig Juicer, and the Rack. I also liked how the story in this film was more emotional than the previous ones, I was able to feel for the characters and what they were going through. And that surgery scene looked so realistic!

I also liked very much the interpretation of Bahar Soomekh who plays as Dr. Lynn Denlon and I believe that she was really outstanding.<br/><br/>Finally I have to say that ""Saw III"" is a really nice movie and I was not expected to be such a nice movie."
"DeepBlue0705","6","1","3","26 January 2014"," Not quite as good as its predecessors but still a lot better than the following sequels
","Rather sadly Saw 3 isn't quite as good as the first two films in the franchise but at the same time the bar was set very high by those two films. What held this film back was some inconsistent acting by the supporting cast, too many games taking place in a short amount of time with some of them having very little relevance to the story and although the plot was once again very strong the final twist wasn't as shocking nor as complex as the previous two films. Making it appear as if the writers took less care on the plot and more interest on the gore content. <br/><br/>The acting was rather strong in this film but not as good, consistent or as strong as the previous films with some of the leading cast being a little bit inconsistent with their characters and performances. For instance, Bahar Soomekh delivers a good performance overall but there are a few certain scenes in which she made Lynn an unbelievable character which removed some tension from some scenes. Shawnee Smith reprises her role as Amanda once more and on the whole is amazing but once again there are a few scenes which were a bit under acted which made me very aware that I was watching a film and therefore it made it a little less compelling. Tobin Bell, however, once again excels as Jigsaw and is marvellous throughout. <br/><br/>The supporting cast was very mixed indeed, but overall I felt that they were pretty weak unlike the previous two films where the supporting cast were just as brilliant as the leading cast. For example, Mpho Koaho seemed like an amateur and anyone could have played his role and it wouldn't have mattered or made a difference. Another pretty weak performer was Barry Flatman who portrayed the Judge, who wasn't bad but was also far from being good as well. The other victims were pretty believable though and did quite a lot for the screen time they were given. As for the rest of the supporting cast, I felt that Dina Meyer especially shone in her role for once and it's her scenes which stood out for me personally. Costas Mandylor and Betsy Russell were only on screen for less than a minute and only had about line each but they still managed to deliver their best performances in the series! <br/><br/>The plot was good but as I stated before the ending wasn't as impressive as the previous two. Elaborating on the overall plot, it was good but for me there were too many traps and this became a problem because now it's starting to get repetitive. One trap that really was not necessary was Dina Meyer's for we already know that Amanda created an inescapable trap and I personally would have liked to have seen Miss Meyer in future instalments but at the same time, that trap had a major presence and it was this trap which haunted me for a while after seeing this film. The rest of the plot though was rather good in my opinion and it was interesting to get a deeper insight on Jigsaw's and Amanda's perspective. <br/><br/>On that note, this film accomplishes something that the upcoming Saw films completely fail at. Flashback scenes. They primarily revolve around Amanda and these scenes make her seem more humane and empathetic than we might have first thought. We get a better insight on why she cuts herself and it clarifies some mysteries that the previous instalments did not answer and I loved this effect as it was effective and unique in the telling of this story and it also made the telling of this story more fluent too. <br/><br/>Another feature that I love about this film is the slow evolution of characters, especially Amanda and Allison, both of whom are minor characters in the first film but by this point they are pivotal characters in the series who are continuously referenced after their demise. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, this film once more has a good plot and a good ending. The acting on the whole is mixed and does effect the quality of the film just a little bit which is a great shame. What is also made apparent in this film is their focus on gore content which in turn shifts them slightly from the plot and it is this that ultimately spells disaster for the future Saw films. Nevertheless, Saw 3 is a very enjoyable instalment and a must see for fans of the franchise."
"howellgirl2011","8","1","3","14 January 2011"," Does Jigsaw finally die for good or come back for more games?
","I could not believe what had happened at the ending of this film. I really thought that Amanda had some feelings for Jigsaw in this film and had some hatred for the doctor(Lynn Denlon)who had been by his side most of the time and she wanted her trap go off and see her die but not Jigsaw. I thought that all the traps in this film were pretty good but the trap called the Rack(cross like twist trap)was pretty intense for the viewers. I thought that man in that trap didn't quite deserve that way to die and I did feel sorry for Jeff(going around and trying to prove justice to all that did wrong in the case of his dead son)at the end because not only did he lose his wife, but he lost his daughter somewhere in the warehouse and he was stuck in a room full of dead bodies with not really a way out. But he should have realized that device around his wife's neck would kill her badly and wait to avenge his son until the collar was off of her and she was in good care of paramedics. But it was to late now. <br/><br/>I love every trap in this film but the one with the woman being frozen to death was pretty bad for her and Jeff because he didn't have time to release her from the chains or stop the water from freezing her down into a frozen slab of meat. But very good movie, I can't wait for the next film, hopefully Jigsaw will return good as new maybe, maybe not?"

","The very first Saw movie was very boring, but had a great storyline, OK acting and a fare amount of gore. The twist was the best part of the movie. Saw 2 lacked acting skills and trap gore. The Gun-Peephole was pointless. I would have rather seen the dude go through the house and redeem himself when no one else could. And finally, Saw 3 comes out. Tops the first 2 by far. It is the longest movie which allows better storyline. The storyline gets me hooked if the traps fall short of expectations (i.e. Saw). The dialogue was very good and the emotion felt real, especially with Shawnee Smith. I loved every second of it, beginning till end. But even now I still cringe when Matthew's crushes his foot. Gross and painful. But still smart and reasonable on his part. Kerry's death was also gory, but still epic. The only thing that was bad for me was Jeff's test. I felt that every chance he had to save someone, it was fairly easy. The Freezer Room, just put your jacket on the poles and get the key. The Pig Vat, just burn the toys. The rack, make sure no one is in front of the shotgun (stupid judge) and untie the key. Everyone should have survived Jeff's test. But oh well. Amanda's final test/twist was good. I loved that Jigsaw knew she wasn't changing and tested her again. She never learned and so she had to die. I felt that if she truly loved John, she would have listened and followed the rules. But she is dead. The best part was the twist again. Jeff had to save John and forgive him to save his wife and daughter. But Jeff let anger control his life, killed his wife, John, and himself. Great movie. Overall, best of the series, thought it comes in second to Saw 3D (don't hate).<br/><br/>9/10"

","The Saw franchise gets so much hate. The films get hate for being 'torture porn', and while I liked it a lot, if I had to label any film that, it would be Saw III. The opening scenes, the one involving Detective Matthews, the one with the man in chains, and the one with Kerry's final scene, are all probably the most disgusting, gruesome, disturbing scenes ever in a horror film. I was flinching so much, and maybe the strong opening is what got a lot of critics mad, and from then on, they decided not to like it. I actually had that same attitude. While Saw was disturbing, but did not show much, and the sequel more gruesome, none of them ever came close to the torture scenes in Saw III, and so I was prepared to hate it. But as the film went on, I noticed how different it was from Saw II. I loved the mystery and tension in the original, and while Saw III does not compare, I actually think it comes close to being just as good. Saw III is actually a much better film than Saw II, which I would never have imagined. Saw II goes the formulaic way of horror films, with a group of people trapped in a scary house, each getting killed one by one. Saw III is not like this. It revolves around two stories, and giving us more information on Jigsaw and how Amanda came to be his assistant. It is all very interesting, and while I thought Bahar Soomekh was the weakest, I found Shawnee Smith and Tobin Bell are very strong actors. They completely made these characters be what they are, and while we had already seen Tobin Bell's great acting in Saw II, we had not seen Smith this important before. She really creates a very compelling and scary character. Her facial expressions, her moods, she gives one heck of a performance, and good for her! Towards the end, the film does become more messy, but I loved it all! The signature twist did not disappoint, although we can hardly be shocked or surprised as much as in the original Saw because we know every time there is a Saw film, there will be a twist at the end. But props to this film, I can see the reason many critics hate it is because of the gruesome and bloody torture scenes, but the film does have central themes about human nature that doesn't make it a brainless horror film. Saw III is actually better than Saw II, and almost as good as the original! Now, I have to see the next installments!"

","Upon watching this movie, I hoped it would redeem itself from the previous Saw movie, Saw II, which was greatly inferior to the first installment. Unfortunately, it proved to be even more boring and redundant than it's predecessor. The movie follows a man (I already forgot his name... probably Jack or Jeff or something common like that) through a series of ""games"" which the mysterious Jigsaw, a dying serial killer has prepared for him, in order to test his forgiveness. Meanwhile, Jigsaw has captured a young doctor who is to keep him alive long enough so that he can witness his final game.<br/><br/>The movie fails in many ways. The plot is similar to that of the two previous movies yet the tension, which was one of the main strengths of the first Saw, is almost inexistent. The acting isn't that great either. The actor who plays Jigsaw is decent, but the rest of the cast are hopelessly under par. The whole experience is in fact quite an ordeal and I was relieved to see the movie end after two hours dark scenes and useless wandering by the supposed ""protagonist"". Finally, the ""shock ending"" is needlessly complex and not very different than that of the two other movies. It even foreshadows more bad news; a fourth Saw movie.

","The inevitable deadening effects of repetition are beginning to infect the ""Saw"" franchise, now having produced its third installment in as many years.<br/><br/>While ""Saw III"" provides a decent number of new twists, psychological as well as torture-wise, it necessarily lacks the originality of its predecessors and -- if the blase response at an opening-day screening at New York's AMC Theatre on 42nd Street is any indication -- audiences may be beginning to develop a ""been there, done that"" attitude. The film opened Friday and, unlike the prior editions, was not screened in advance for press.<br/><br/>Seamlessly similar in style to the earlier films, this sequel finds its archvillain Jigsaw (Tobin Bell, again delivering a quietly intense and scary performance) not doing so well. Desperately ill, he and his loyal follower, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), have enlisted -- well, forced -- the help of a female doctor (Bahar Soomekh) to perform some emergency surgery. Helping to motivate her is the fact that she's been outfitted with an explosive collar tied into Jigsaw's heart monitor, so if he dies, she dies with him"

","Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is dying and his protégé Amanda (Shawnee Smith) is slowly taking his place. Jigsaw is planning a huge game for a vengeful father Jeff (Angus MacFadyen), who wants revenge for his son death. Since his son got hit by a car. Since Jeff is trapped in a huge, mysterious industrial place. Jeff has to find all the clues to get out. While Jigsaw kidnaps a doctor (Bahar Soomekh) to operated on his condition. But this doctor finds herself frighten by Amanda. What the doctor, Jeff or even Amanda doesn't know that Jigsaw is planning a huge trip for them. Which they should play the rules to survive.<br/><br/>Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw 2) made an strong second sequel to the successful ""Saw"" movies. Director Bousman and Screenwriter:Leigh Whannell (Saw) go on a darker route on this one by fleshing out character development, having unique death traps and some sadistic dark humour. This is the darkest of the three films. Although isn't quite suspenseful as the first one or wicked as the second one. But it is different, despite some slow spots here and there.<br/><br/>This is the Unrated DVD by having some minutes of additional footage. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen(1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The highlights of the DVD are the three commentary tracks:Which they are informative, humorous and entertaining. Commentary one is by the director:Bousman, Screenwriter:Whannell and executive producers:Peter Block and Jason Constantine. Commentary two is by the producers:Oren Koules and Mark Berg. Commentary three is by the director:Bousman, Editor:Kevin Greutert and Director of Photographer:David A. Armstrong. DVD also includes featurettes and trailers.<br/><br/>The best achievement of ""Saw 3"" is actually the good production designs by David Hackl. Even though ""Saw 3"" has a story, it feels more like Style over Subtances wins this one over. Dina Meyer returns in this one in a small part and as well Donnie Walhberg from ""Saw 2"". Whannell appears as Adam in a cameo from the first film. ""Saw 3"" has some strong moments, some unexpected twists and a few surprise cameos. ""Saw 3"" seems to be the perfect way to end the series but since it was an box office success. Studio:Lions Gate and Director:Bousman are already working on ""Saw 4"". I always felt that ""Saw 3"" runs of steam towards the end. By ""Saw 4"", hopefully they should come up with new stories and characters if they want to make this franchise fresher. It's daring but director:Bousman did a good job with the second and third of the series. Probably still has the right elements to surprise the audiences with the future movies. Story by James Wan (Dead Silence, Death Sentence, Saw) and Leigh Whannell. (****/*****)."

","Well Well. What a waste of my time and money. Rented this out after plucking up the courage to watch it(oh dear god why???). After hearing so many reports of it being stomach churningly violent with blood and guts and revolting tortures I was biding my time until I felt I could stomach it. After all I'd heard people were fainting and throwing up in the movie theatres.<br/><br/>If all you like is gore and ""eeewwwww"" moments then this is probably for you. I have no problem watching gore nut it's in your faces all the time now that it takes a LOT for me to cover my eyes. In the first scene of this film, for example, I burst out laughing which somehow I don't think that is what they were aiming for.<br/><br/>The storyline(?) was disjointed and confusing I had no idea what was going on and how everything was supposed to link together. This could just be my fault as my mind was wandering quite a bit. I stuck it our for a full half hour then left my fiancé to try and make sense of it. He gave up shortly after.<br/><br/>They seem to have sacrificed a decent plot to try to raise the shock factor. Didn't work for me."

","The first SAW was intriguing. Although it was so obviously derived from Seven, I still thought it was clever. One of its traits I admired was that it made me flinch from the gore without actually displaying any gore. In my humble opinion, that is an example of the art of movie making.

Not worth the breath required to cast a comment.<br/><br/>I heard great things about Saw 3. Of course, I had heard great things about King Kong (2005) too. I was disappointed. In fact, I had to literally force myself to watch the film. I saw the ending coming within the first 15 minutes. I felt absolutely no pity for any of the characters, save the poor chap who was forced to swim in pig guts. The gore was disgusting in an obnoxious and irritating kind of way. Saw 3 is a prime example of a film franchise that needs to be put down to sleep... permanently."

","Not a bad horror film though i have to say the first film is still the best in the franchise & Saw 2 is a better film than this one in the storyline department but the gore in this film is better than it's 2 predecessors. Great gore scenes where Jigsaw gets brain surgery & the lady Dr has to very graphically open up his brain & the scene of Dina Meyer's Detective character getting her ribs ripped open was extremely brutal if kinda disappointing as the cameras pulled away at a crucial moment. Also the judge having to slowly drown in the rotted pig corpses was especially gross & very inventive. And the storyline of Amanda being the one who was doing the killings for Jigsaw explains a lot as i used to wonder how in the hell a sickly terminally ill man could kidnap & then concoct these elaborate torture devices/bombs to pull these people apart. Not a bad film but I heard they are planning on a Saw 4 & i don't see how due to the death of Tobin BELL's Jigsaw character at the end of this one but please don't make Angus megaton's Character a follower of Jigsaw's methods.That would be LAME!!! ** out of *****"
"ferguson-6","5","1","3","21 November 2006"," Pork, the other white meat
","Greetings again from the darkness. Third in the Saw series developed by James Wan, this one is significantly better than the second, but falls short of the first, due mostly to the lack of freshness. Three is (as Two was)directed by Darren Lynn Bousman who benefits from a much more complex script and less complicated gadgets and contraptions.<br/><br/>This story centers around Jigsaw (the eerily great Tobin Bell) playing one of his infamous games with a brilliant, yet detached doctor (played well by Bahan Soomekh) who is charged with keeping Jigsaw alive during his last test(s) on his protégé Amanda (played horribly in her third turn by Shawnee Smith). The twists are minimal in this story, but as opposed to Saw II, the twists and turns make sense.<br/><br/>Be prepared for even more gore than the first two, but again we have no character that we really care about or pull for. Amanda may be one of the least sympathetic film characters ever. The flashback scenes are not very effective ... the exception being Donnie Wahlberg and his poor foot. As always, the best scenes include Tobin Bell and his lessons of life for the misguided souls who end up on the wrong end of his ""fair"" tests."
"alexantonopoulos","4","1","3","11 November 2006"," The worst from the series
","I remember two years ago,when I watched ''Saw'' from the first time...What a wonderful experience.The best cop film ever.A compelling drama,which unlike most of today's films,shocked you with it's plot,instead of it's violence.And a revelation was made in the end that left me with my mouth wide-open,looking at the screen even when the credits were playing. One year later,''Saw 2'' came out.Very good film,but I was disappointed.Although the plot still grabbed you tight,the direction was still cool as hell,and Jigsaw's philosophies were more researched(along with his past),the problems were that you had a(boring) main character who always did wrong choices,even during the game,and other characters for whom you never really learner much about,concluding with a very obvious revelation,which was anything by surprising.Still,very good film. So,when I saw the teaser for the third installment,I was curious to see what's going to happen.However,the teaser grew in me a ''fear'' that the third will be all about gore,something that unfortunately has been confirmed... I was greatly disappointed by this film.The amazing plot and emotionality of the first two films have been replaced by useless and over-the-top sick images and violence,which are too sick even for the Saw franchise(the first film never really got after that 'too sick and violent thing' that much-neither did the second film). The revelation is very much expected for a viewer who keeps guessing possible endings during the film,but although the revelation here is more surprising then the one in the previous film,the big problem is that this revelation is completely uninteresting and boring.It's like the ''revelation'' for Zep in the first film:Only there you just knew that was a fake ending,so you enjoyed that misdirection from the makers.Here,while I was waiting the true ending after the revelation,when the end credits rolled I discovered that was it... On the plus side:Really cool music by Charlie Clouser,good direction by Bousman,nice points in the story about revenge and forgiving,some interesting flashbacks about Jigsaw's and Amanda's history and work,great performances by all the main cast members."

","""Hello, dear readers. That time of year is upon us once again--a time when we ask our loyal constituents to look deep in their gore-dipped hearts and make a donation to the Jigsaw Miracle Network. This year, a portion of your donation will go to Jigsaw's Kids, to help perpetuate future generations of murderous masterminds wreaking psychological torment and physical torture on unsuspecting common folk who put their lives to no good use. Make your pledge to see ""Saw III""--heck, see it twice--so that one of the current lone beacons of quality horror may continue to warm our hearts with its reign of terror!""<br/><br/>Richard Roeper called the original ""Saw"" ""an exercise in audience manipulation,"" damning the film to a position on his 'Worst of 2004' list. Needless to say, I think he missed the point--horror films, when done well, are all ABOUT audience manipulation; being terrorized by a madman for 90 minutes, at the end of which we are given the mandatory plot-twists, can be quite fun. As in the first two ""Saw"" films, diabolical mastermind Jigsaw is a sly string-puller, and one of the more endearing, well-defined villains in recent horror history.<br/><br/>""Saw III,"" in addition to being a twisty torture chamber of nasty surprises, is the third installment in one of the only horror franchises with any quality (most--no matter how awful--do well at the box-office). I approached this sequel with great skepticism--after all, the prolific ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series trudged on for years, seeing little to no glory after their initial installments (condemn ""Scream"" all you want--at least Wes Craven had the dignity to end it at ""3"").<br/><br/>My fear of ""Saw III"" plunging a thus-far successful series into the toilet lasted for the first 15 minutes--a montage of bad acting, bad setup, and overall crudity (with two characters forced to fight against traps with no exit) that almost completely dashed my hopes. Then, to my surprise and delight, ""Saw III"" redeemed itself. Once cancer patient/mastermind of murder John ""Jigsaw"" (Tobin Bell) enters the scene, hooked up to life support and apparently breathing his last, his utterance to partner-in-pain Amanda (Shawnee Smith)--""I want to play a game""--kicks the film into high gear. The contestants on this round of Wheel of Torture are Jeff (Angus Macfadyen), a revenge-minded father looking to get even with the drunk driver who killed his son; and Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh), a doctor enlisted to keep John alive, otherwise a harness around her neck will blow her to bits.<br/><br/>As with ""Saw II"" (and, to a lesser extent, the original film), ""Saw III"" has fun playing with the mythos that have been established in the series so far. Some questions are answered, some loose ends explained, and while one could argue that this is unnecessary overkill, I enjoyed the little segues that referenced the previous films. It's not a revisionist history (like idiotically adding a man in black--or Busta Rhymes--to ""Halloween""), just a play on the seemingly deliberate ambiguities throughout the series. Granted, this often comes off as an attempt to out-twist the previous films, but I cannot fault ""Saw III""'s narrative ambition--there's a richness of detail present that could provide a solid base for a prequel and maybe 2 more sequels. (Pauses while the critics recoil in horror.) <br/><br/>Is there blood, you ask? Yes, and it's rather disturbing stuff; no, not because there's a lot of it thrown in our face (which there is, along with pureed pig guts, but that's another story), but because it complements the story and characters so well. I won't give away any of Jigsaw's torture techniques this time out, but his methodology (and the filmmakers') puts the viewer in a morally jarring position--the 'guilty' are turned into victims, to the point where our 'hero' looks as repulsive for simply standing idly by. Additionally, the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda, briefly explored at the end of ""Saw II,"" is dramatically plausible, and even heartbreaking. Loyalty, guilt, revenge, and other emotions of Biblical proportion are smeared across the screen in all their ugliness and beauty. Amazingly, director Darren Lynn Bousman and writer Leigh Whannel make this commentary fresh and genuinely gripping--the conclusion of ""Saw III"" is a lesson in the boundlessness of revenge that is as compelling as it is blood-spattered.<br/><br/>Though ""Saw III"" has some flaws (including a completely implausible scene involving a hidden camera and some shaky performances) and the constantly-jerking camera movements are enough to induce vomiting, it is, quite surprisingly, the best showing of the series thus far. Quite rare for me to say (or even think) this after a second sequel, but ""bring on the next one!""<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"
"nobbytatoes","7","1","3","6 November 2006"," most intense of the three
","Leigh Whannell and James Wan created one of the most intriguing films/franchises, that most notedly arrived at a trend of torture porn. While violence has been always present in horror/thrillers, it's a key element, though contemporary film makers have taken heed to throw their audience into the violence head first without hesitation. The victims suffer pain and agony, while similarly we the audience suffer in respect having to witness such anguish. Unsuspecting people thrown into intricately designed ""games"", to inflict pain and suffering, with death as the usual outcome.<br/><br/>Jigsaw, with his new apprentice Amanda continue there quest to free people from their lives, which they act is worthless; they soon release how much they value their life when placed in a live and death situation. Saw started of as a simple two hander, Saw 2 up the body count with multiple victims. Saw 3 is a strip back to basics, stripping the cast back, ultimately creating the best of the three films.<br/><br/>Saw had amazing concepts and potential, yet not executed well; a flawed yet effective thriller. Saw 2 dropped the ball, with characters you wouldn't give a second look, just waiting idly by while each one meet their maker in grizzly deaths. Whannel taking helm with the pen again, Saw 3 regained focus and drastically change the formula around. Saw 3 takes time and doesn't rush; you may think other wise when two victims are dispensed straight off. Whannel calms the chaos of simple consecutive killings and develops characters you care and connect with.<br/><br/>Running two games parallel, Jigsaw has kidnapped Dr. Lynn Denlon, to keep him alive or she dies along with his fate. Concurrent is another game with victim Jeff, a depressed father unable to move on from his son's death. Jeff is faced with a series of tests, in an ultimate battle for him to let go. Unlike the previous installments, pathos is given to both Lynn and Jeff, trapped in both their predicaments. Layers are revealed in Amanda, trying to take on Jigsaw's legacy and her initial genesis. Time slips back, new angles revealed upon parts of Saw and Saw 2. Developing the story and digging into the characters payed of enormously.<br/><br/>Back to the torture porn. It's an element used extremely well by director Darren Lynn Bousman. While used minimally and effective by James Wan, Bousman over drove the gore and violence in Saw 2, without much merit to be given; violence for violence sake. Taking focus, slowing down the hyperactive quick cut directing, the violence and gore works more effectively; extremely more effectively. It's gut wrenching and energy draining; it's exhausting after this ride is over. Each test sees an increase of extreme torture, hitting to the most disturbing center pieces; The Wrack. Paradoxically, the violence is the main drawing power to this franchise and the most deterring for Saw 3. Bousman pushed to the boundaries too far, becoming all too much at times; but credit due exceeding in his plan to make you shift uncomfortably in your seat.<br/><br/>Raising the level in another aspect is the acting. Tobin Bell evokes eeriness just from his voice. Shawnee Smith is steely cold and maniacal and the best out of the whole cast. Angus Macfadyen mixes pain, resentment and sorrow in Jeff's turmoil. Bahar Soomekh is amazing stuck in a conflict on interests and morals. Maybe as Bousman took time to pull better performances out of his cast you care more about them and what actually happens to them.<br/><br/>With time and focus given to the story and development of the characters, instead of churning out a simple money spinner to play off the original Saw's success, Saw 3 supersedes it's predecessors."

He needs to save these people from various traps. Meanwhile Lynn (Bahar Soomekh) needs to keep Jigsaw alive, or the device strapped to her head will explode.....<br/><br/>There is much more character development in this one than in the others. I cared for the victims and there was a lot of insight into John and Amanda's characters. The acting was actually good in this one and the special effects were top-notch. That said, there were a few things that really bugged me about his movie. One major problem was the editing. Like all the other Saws, the editing is quick and flashy and it's very irritating, as is the music. Also, this movie relied way too much on sadistic gore to scare the audience. It gets quite boring after awhile, rendering the movie absolutely scare free.<br/><br/>2/5"

So my one main problem with the movie was that it was way to predictable, about a half and hour in, i knew what was going to happen. i knew how everything was tied together. and i knew who the people were. i say that even though the movie was still quite amazing. the first two beat it to a pulp. maybe it is just me. and it did not explain all that much in the movie about how they got the other people. but that is all i will say without giving away anything. don't get me wrong. i loved the movie. i hope they make another, less predictable installment in the series."

Don't get me wrong I know it's just a film but it just goes beyond the extreme in terms of gore. I like to watch a film and let my imagination do the rest but this way too graphical. I watched quite a lot of the film looking through my fingers and at some points I had to close my eyes and cover my ears. I know I might sound mellow dramatic as ""It's Just a film"" as my partner says but it's just the concept of it. Other people had to look away as well so needless to say it's definitely got the realism factor. <br/><br/>So apart from the fact that it is very gory and a couple walked out 10 minutes before the end, the sound and visual effects and acting were very good. If you enjoy these type of films and don't take them too seriously like me then I'd recommend. Also because I couldn't overlook the sick factor I didn't pay as much attention to the story which is a shame really because it had the scope of being an excellent film like the first one."

","After being very disappointed of SAW II I expected another lame movie. Well, with this one the movie makers really tried. But somehow I couldn't get excited for it. Many of the strange things in the movies are getting clear at the end of it, so I won't complain about them though I didn't like the way the policewoman was treated. What I missed was suspense, was psychological pressure on the people. Despair, anger, being really horrified. The people killed in this movie...they had almost no personality, none of them. That's what I don't like about this one, that's what I didn't like in movies like Hostel. You don't feel anything about the people because you don't know them or you don't like them. It doesn't matter to you if they are tortured to death or not. You maybe think: ""Okay, THAT was rude"" but nothing more. The family father in SAW III, he was chosen because he was so sad about the death of his little 8years old son. Really? Come on, what the hell?! Is that a crime? This is pretty far-catched. The conclusion at the end of it was unfortunately not so surprisingly and so well prepared like in SAW I. How could it?, it was just part 3. But somehow I had the feeling that the people working on the movie really tried to make an exciting movie. But in some way, I think, it was more or less boring, the more I think about it. So, 3 stars is okay. It was bad, the story wasn't too good, but it wasn't as bad part 2, which was a relief. See it once and then forget about it."

A lot of the Saw I people were disappointed with Saw II. I actually liked Saw II better (the acting in Saw I was more gut-wrenching for me than the gore), and this movie proved to tie BOTH together into something everyone could appreciate. They did an excellent job researching what fans liked about these movies, and it truly feels like fans were delivered the best that could be offered.<br/><br/>What can I say without giving away anything? The pace is excellent, opening up with 2 gruesome traps to get the heart pumping, and non-stop suspense switching from situation, to situation. The traps were horrifying, disturbing, intense, and extreme... guaranteed nightmares! I find it incredible that the director can create sequences that provoke tension, anxiety, horror and terror without having to input senseless gore... the Saw series is impressive in this day and age of bad PG-13 horror movies (a-la-grudge), because the horror sequences aren't used to create the bear minimum of entertainment, they are used to dictate a great and CLEVER story. Saw III is carrying along a great series, keep em coming!"
"jamaalshabazz","10","1","3","28 October 2006"," This Was A Great Horror Film!!!
","This was a great film indeed. I usually don't flinch or turn away from horror films but this one was sick and twisted. I cant believe almost everyone was shocked by this film. I thought the film was going to be short and not that good. I saw the other two and barely sat through them. But this film I was on my toes and anticipating every next move. I thought Saw 1 and 2 were OK but not as good as Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2004 and The remake of the old one too. I recommend this movie to everyone. You will think this is one of the gruesomest movie almost ever made. There's nothing but death after death and you never get a chance to see too many people but once or twice before they die. So go ahead and watch this movie I guarantee if your a horror film lover you will definitely love this film."
"katdawg620","10","1","3","28 October 2006"," Best of the three...
","I absolutely LOVED this movie! I actually saw the Saw Trilogy where they played 1, 2, and then 3 in a row, and it was the best night of my life! I could not wait to see the third one. I was expecting it to be good since the writer *Leigh Whannell* said it was the goriest of the three, and that he got ""physically ill"" while watching it. He was right! I have never felt like that from watching a movie before, and it was SO good! I went to see it with some friends and we were literally squirming in our seats. So yeah, it was very good! I can remember watching the very first one and at the end I was crying because I was so grossed out and upset from the end, and I didn't watch it for another 8 months. But then I watched it again and it became my favorite movie. I then bought the first and second ones, and I loved them so much. Then I ended up waiting for the third one for forever it seemed. So I finally got to see it and I LOVED IT! If you are a Saw fan, this one is a MUST MUST MUST!!!!"
"Wakesurfer2468","10","1","3","28 October 2006"," saw 3
","This movie in my personal opinion was amazing. I mean it was a little unrealistic but you never know. Saw 3 definitely tops the other 2. If you are looking for a movie with gore, thrill, and suspense this movie is for you. This movie contains some nudity though which is different from the other two. Though the nudity isn't that long it is still their. Another thing is that this movie was hyped up to be the goriest movie in over 20 years. THEY LIED. Their were some gory parts I admit but anyone remember Hannibal. HE FED SOMEONE Their BRAIN. That is a tad gorier that some performing surgery. <br/><br/>This movie for the die hard fans will be AMAZING BEYOND BELIEF but for those people who haven't seen the first two your screwed. It answers a lot of unsolved questions about the first 2. <br/><br/>I loved it and I suggest you see it"
"fluffycloud1977","10","1","3","28 October 2006"," Gory, gruesome and bl**dy great!
","Wow! The latest of the Saw movies (will there be any more??) and the goriest by far! My fiancé, who is not normally bothered by gore, proclaimed it to be the most gruesome film he's ever seen. Now that's praise indeed from him, believe me. If you've seen the previous instalments, the plot/death scenes will be nothing new to you. Whoever thinks up the death scenes for these movies must have a poorly head! It's not an intellectual film, don't go expecting something highbrow, it follows in the same format as the previous two. A great film for a Saturday night - thoroughly enjoyed it. When it finished last night, the packed out cinema gave a spontaneous round of applause!"
"Awakening124","10","1","3","27 October 2006"," My expectations were met to the nth degree.
","While they stepped up on the gore a bit, it's still the same Saw we know and love. This is one of my favorite trilogies ever, with every entry being just as strong (if not stronger) as the one before it. YOu get everything with the third installment: Gore, story, acting, creativity, and one hell of an ending. Every Saw film had me covering my mouth, my eyes wide with shock at the twist(s), and this one delivers just as superbly as the other two. Fans of Saw will LOVE this one. If you're not already a fan of the first two, however, I doubt this one will change your mind, as it's hardly a departure from the previous two movies. If anything, it embraces what it is even more."
"skirmantux","7","2","12","27 October 2006"," The Goriest Movie In Past 20 years!!!
","I waited for ""SAW III"" about 7 months and I finally watched it. It was definitely gory as the creators said. Today I almost lost my reserved place, which I was reserved two days ago. About 88% of all watcher was reserved heir places, because this movie is very very popular and all people are crazy about it.<br/><br/>The beginning of this movie was too dark and I cant see anything. But the creepiest thing was showed very good. Everyone in hall was freak out. I was expected the chains scene first, but the bathroom was OK.<br/><br/>When they kidnapped a doctor Lynn, then begins THE MOVIE. The rules was really smart and it was definitely entertaining. I don't knew, that Jeff had to revenge for he's angriness. Thoes three traps was not that good, that the original and first sequel, but it was much torture, that psychological nightmare...<br/><br/>Actors acted the same wonderful, like in the original. There was more twists and it makes this movie to be ONE OF THE BEST IN HORROR. Script was the same too, because James Wan is the same good, as like in past three years. If it will be a part IV, I will go there sure (if it will be a world premiere). I give a 8 for the one of goriest movies of all time..."
"trashgang","8","1","4","6 December 2011"," low on gore but deeper into jigsaw's story
","Same director as part 2, same writers and same production team. What could they do to the franchise to keep you attracted? Bringing out different versions of the flick, so I just watched the 113 minutes version, more then IMDb stated (108 minutes). <br/><br/>The story picks up exactly were part 2 ended but naturally they had to bring in back again the torture porn that was now on his heydays. But they moved a bit away from the genre by going in much deeper into the relation between Amanda and Jigsaw. And I must say that it worked out fine. They dared to put out some main actors from part 2 and brought in some new names. Dina Meyer had to leave as did Donnie Wahlberg. New names came in and the most important one to the franchise is Costas Mandylor, but here he is only 2 minutes in it. I was glad that they moved away from the story like in part 2 were we had a bunch of convicts being brought together. Here we do have some victims who are going to meet some Jigsaw devices and I must say that they were so far the gruesomest in the series. The one in the beginning were Troy (J.LaRose)is full of chains going trough his body is also one that nobody will forget. On the other hand the twisting of bone structure isn't for the faint hearted too. What they also brought in was full frontal nudity doing so with another device. It was something we hadn't seen so far in the series.<br/><br/>The way it was filmed was the same as in the previous flicks. A lot of flashbacks and the use of fast moving images. The revealing at the end was again unpredictable. And now I must admit that I was glad that I am watching them in a row, because you pick up so much details. If you watched them one at a year as they came out, you have forgotten a lot. I liked this version more then Saw II even as it has less blood in it, but when it comes to the bloody parts it's more gory then part 2. In fact you could see that the editing and use of score was done by the same editor, Kevin Greutert. He also will be becoming more and more important in the franchise, after part 5 he will be the new director.<br/><br/>Now that I picked up the Saw franchise and am beginning to like it more and more. It do has a good storyline and you want to see what is going to happen next, surely one to have in on your horror shelves<br/><br/>Gore 4/5 Nudity 2/5 Effects 5/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5"
"paulpersic","7","1","4","28 August 2011"," continues well, gory and surprising as ever!
","Okay, now i heard from my friends that this 1 sucked. I looked online and they seemed to kinda agree, but it was awesome.<br/><br/>First things first, the plot. Its about a married couple with problems that has been captured by the so-called serial killer named jigsaw and one has to keep jigsaw alive at all times from cancer while the other is playing a series of deadly games.<br/><br/>In this saw, they focus a lot about the character Amanda who has a story quite interesting. I am not going to spoil anything, but i can tell you this, do not watch saw III without watching the other 2. The character jigsaw is once again, such an awesome villain, and the acting from others was pretty good. The complaint i might have for the film is that they went a little overdone with the gore it was not at all necessary, but i wont slam the film hard for that.<br/><br/>Overall saw III is a clever and well done sequel, so hopefully saw IV does not ruin the franchise. By the way,there are three twists in saw III and they are pretty cool 8.5/10."
"Jwdjrs","8","1","4","23 August 2011"," It was really good!
","First of all, I don't know why people find this disgusting. It's called SAW 3! Everybody knows each sequel gets bloodier and bloodier! What do they expect?! The only problem this film is that the ""nudity"" wasn't needed. I still have not seen Saw 4, but I intend to watch Saw 4,5,6, and 7. This movie is indeed very gory and gruesome, but it was still worth watching! Very worth it! The ""rated R"" version may be less gorier because I got Unrated Version. But I do highly recommend this Saw movie to every hard horror fan (like me). I got the cleanest version that I could find on ""NetFlix"". They did not have the rated version. The had the regular Uncut version and the Unrated Directors Cut version. Be warned, there is a disgusting scene involving pig carcasses. The ending is very bloody! But if are looking for a good Friday Night Fright, this would be a great movie to rent. I very highly recommend this film. Look for Saw III. Enjoy!!"
"shariq_forever","9","1","4","5 January 2011"," Its not a game, its a lesson -- I saw SAW I to SAW VII
","Masterpiece fabulous story told in 7 years. Some movies are made to tell us Why the movies are made and give us a good reason to watch movies. Marvelously written and brilliantly filmed, Very Interesting and Intriguing. The message of the Saw series movies are clear -- don't abuse yourself, don't abuse others, control your emotions, and be fair. Do not take drugs, do not smoke, do not cheat or lie, do not frame others, try to forgive, do not keep vengeance, control the obsessions, do not make profits on others death -- Follow the Rules, and you will win in the end. Do not sin from the tiniest to the gruesome/ heinous. There are many gore and horrible scenes when the victims are TESTED. But I think its a glimpse of hell, what we can expect as the wrong doers will be punished in the after life, because they did not followed the rules or had not got the clues. <br/><br/>Its not a game -- Make Your Choices! Cherish Your Life!<br/><br/>When the Legacy was handed over from John to Detective Hoffman, it all started going in the wrong direction. He tried to fulfill John's Will, but as he had lesser human side, and was going himself against the rules. He became a Victim to be Tested by himself. The Final Chapter is also more interesting with more gore and gruesome scenes and more people getting killed now, mostly innocent and police officers. Before it is Game Over!"
"callanvass","9","1","4","24 May 2010"," In my opinion? the best sequel in the series by far.
","Saw III has surprises and twists galore, but the best thing about it is, they all have a point and a reason. You have to pay strict attention throughout the movie, because every detail counts, every scene is precious because the twist at the end will knock you straight out of your seat, at least it did with me. Saw II for my tastes was too slick for its own good, too glossy and Saw III brought back all the elements that I loved in the 1st one. It really messes with your mind, and digs deep into your emotions by giving you characters you can identify with. The best had to be Jeff by far. I felt so bad for him, I could feel the pain he was going through, and despite his selfish motives, you just wanna reach out and help him. If you have a weak stomach you're best to avoid Saw III at all costs, because this is one of the grisliest movies I've ever seen in my life. Saw III has scares, gore, good storyline and great psychology, it's without a doubt the best sequel in the series.<br/><br/>Performances. Tobin Bell is a frightening presence, not because of his physical appearance, but because of the games he plays. He's at his best here and I was frightened by him on plenty of occasions. Shawnee Smith goes all out here, and gives an absolutely spell binding performance. Her vulnerability, yet the psychotic side she displayed at the same time kept me on edge the whole way, she's one of the many reasons this movie works so well, she's great to look at too. Angus Macfadyen is one tortured individual, and for good reason. His heart is broken after the loss of his son, and him bordering on the brink of obsession was just heartbreaking to watch. Bahar Soomekh's cold portrayal of Lynn worked and also worked against her. Her character is shady and selfish, but it worked for the part, though I can't say I felt much sympathy for her. Donnie Wahlberg doesn't have much to do this time around. Dina Meyer is OK in her screen time.<br/><br/>Bottom line. This is what most sequels aspire to be. It holds up against the original really well, and in my opinion is the real sequel to Saw. They should have stopped here, because this is as good as it gets.<br/><br/>9/10"
"jboothmillard","4","1","4","15 May 2007"," Saw III
","The first two were fantastic, and I had seen what the critics thought of this one, and ignored them, and it came out okay. Basically, the film begins with Det. Eric Matthews (Ransom's Donnie Wahlberg, from the second one) escaping by breaking his foot to get out of his chains, and then we move on to the cops finding another corpse. After the investigation, detective Kerry (Dina Meyer), from the first two) examines Jigsaw's latest torture tape, and then from discovering a camera in her closet, ends up in her own trap. Then we get to the real story, where Dr. Lynn Denlon (Bahar Soomekh) has been kidnapped by Amanda (Shawnee Smith), Jigsaw's apprentice and taken to Jigsaw, or John (Tobin Bell) who may be breathing his last breath, from his condition of cancer and a tumour. Lynn has a neck collar with explosive caps put around her, and it is connected to Jigsaw's heart rate, so if his rate drops and he dies, so does she from the explosions. Meanwhile, Lynn's husband, vengeful Jeff (Braveheart's Angus Macfadyen) has been told that he has the opportunity to get revenge for the man who killed his son, but along the way of these tests, he meets people who were linked to the murder, that he could revenge on, but these tests are mainly to test if he can forgive. Also starring Leigh Whannell returning as Adam (from the first one), Mpho Koaho as Tim, Barry Flatman as Judge Halden, Lyriq Bent as Rigg, J. LaRose as Troy, Debra Lynne McCabe as Danica and Billy the Jigsaw Puppet (LOL). I can see why the critics gave it two out of five stars, in terms of confusing flashbacks, and I hardly understand the ending with Amanda being tested, but you cannot help but love the elaborate bloody gore which even more gruesome than the other two films, particularly cutting Jigsaw's head open to remove skull (to relieve pressure). Traps include: the guy with various chains in his body (skin) and he has to rip them out before the nearby bomb goes off, the woman in the trap that will rip her ribcage out unless she gets the key out of the corrosive acid, the freezer room with the hanging woman being sprayed by cold water with the key behind some bars, the man chained to the floor while pig's fluids (from being mashed up by saws) are pouring in, and Jigsaw's favourite ""The Rack"" with the guy having his arms, legs and head twisted with the key on the trigger on a gun. Jigsaw may be dead (slid on the neck by an electric saw), but there may be continuation because he was the only one who knows where Jeff's daughter is. Not as good as the other two, but worth a look. Okay!"
"jtindahouse","10","1","4","17 January 2007"," Now I can die!!!
","This movie is simply pure pleasure from start to finish. Watching it all and trying to work it all out before the twist is finally delivered is exhilarating and then when it finally is delivered it will leave you breathless. Basically in my books it's the perfect movie - not a moment of dullness and then a twist. I was in heaven and I can imagine a lot of other people feeling the exact same way throughout the 2 hours. There was a scene at the start when even I felt a bit queasy, but after that there weren't too many really disturbing scenes (for Saw's standards anyway). This one definitely contains the best acting out of the trilogy and is quite possibly the best overall as well.<br/><br/>Not for everyone, that much is for sure (my sister next to me all most passed out at the start), but if you think you're one who can handle the jandal, you won't be disappointed at all."

","I have to confess that Saw I really got me, I loved the plot, the actors, etc...now with the third part, they just are going down to the drain, more gore, not believable plot story etc...what a shame, stop making movies about the torture, ultra violence, and tones of blood for free. Hostel 2 is coming...Texas Chainsaw, I do not see any positive ending with this new trend. Go for Scary movies, where evil is in your imagination, etc... Take as example some Japanese horror movies, they do not show how pain is done on their victims, they leave it up to you. I came out of the movie theater sad, my stomach upside down and saying another guts and blood movie like many other cheap movies had been release."
"DJAkin","9","1","4","5 November 2006"," Move over Hannibal Lechter, Jigsaw is in town....
","First of all, the gore and pain in this movie was very intense. Saw part 3 is pain personified. The fact that Jigsaw came up with so many new ways to torture and torment is proof that there is indeed...a God. A horror masterpiece this is. Jigsaw never gets out of bed the entire movie due to his illness. And the man with the robe is very angry. I have to admit that the grossest part of this entire movie was the Sow's being dropped into a blender and then the sow goop going all over the judge. I almost puked. Also, the black man who was being tortured was a little gross. They actually showed part of his bone snapping out of the lower leg. Donnie Walhberg's role in this was minimal but it did show his crushing and cutting his left foot. I was grossed out. All in all, Jigsaw is the best villain of all time."
"TheZackMorse","6","1","4","29 October 2006"," Pay attention and you'll see it coming...
","Okay - maybe this isn't a REAL Spoiler, but, let's just say that the main thing that Saw III lacks is the element of surprise. If you've seen the other two, and you're paying attention, you'll be able to figure out where they're going with it - which bothered me, personally. The gore factor in Saw films has been part of their draw, but, the plot twists were another - and these seem sort of predictable, and also, IMHO, forced right up in your face - for some reason.<br/><br/>On the positive side, it's nice that Jigsaw / John is allowed a good amount of screen time to develop the character even more than in Saw II. Amanda's character flaws come to the surface very clearly - I don't know if that's good or bad acting, but, everything about her performance felt over exaggerated.<br/><br/>So, aside from the plot(s), there's the ""games"" to consider - there's plenty of gore and the usual Saw fare going on. The reason I gave this a 6 out of 10 is because in retrospect (without spoiling anything), it makes sense that certain elements were lacking. Again, if you've been following the films, you know about John's/Jigsaw's condition, and why things have changed a bit.<br/><br/>As for an obligatory plot summary: Jigsaw is dying. A doctor is kidnapped to keep Jigsaw/John alive so he can play out one (perhaps) final game. (I'll just leave it at that.)<br/><br/>One other comment - could movie theater owners PLEASE stop turning down the bulbs on their projectors to the point where you can't see a g**damn thing?! It's a DARK film, and when the bulb's brightness has been reduced in an attempt to save money, you can't SEE SQUAT in films like this half the time! <br/><br/>Bottom line: It's worth seeing in the theater, but, you'll probably want to also see the DVD (which will most likely be an unrated one) - so you can actually SEE the film - or go complain to the theater manager."
"ritadsbg88","5","1","4","28 October 2006"," Want To Play A Game? I Did And Lost Big Time!
","I can only give this movie a 5 because it lacks much. The plot to the story doesn't have the kind of grab you'd expect a movie like this to have. To me the premise of the movie is good but it isn't executed (no pun intended) properly. It was one gruesome or horrific experience after the other. I will give credit to those who think up the torture devices. They once again were able to terrify and amaze me at the creativity someone can possess. Maybe those in the art department could give the people on the other side of the camera a few pointers. The acting actually wasn't too bad but there were some parts where it could have used some punching up. Now, I won't pretend to be an expert when it comes to movies. I mean, I'm only 18 but I know what the cost of a movie ticket should include. For what my money is worth, Saw III just isn't worth it. Would you like to play a game? It's called who wasted an evening. And the winner was me."

","For all you people that ""loved"" Saw 3...<br/><br/>all I have to say is COME ON. This movie was bad. I didn't like the 1st one, but it was tolerable. the Second one I did like because of character development and the twist at the end made sense.<br/><br/>so OK, if you saw saw 3 (haha) heres some things that I thought gave it a 4.. warning spoilers 1) No guy that your cheating on your husband with would ever say ""I want a divorce"" the writer only added that to trick us, so its shoved down our throat that they are married 2) When the judge gets shot by the shotgun, he had to be standing in the exact right spot.. if he was standing 2 inches to the left or by the door or something, I am pretty sure the end would have been ten times different as he would have helped angus mcfadden.<br/><br/>3) The dialogue was extremely lame, come on (you died inside and your a shell of a man) thats so cliché.<br/><br/>4) The ""Apprentice to jigsaw"" actress was terrible, I didn't know what she was trying to be and she would always make her eyes really wide.<br/><br/>5) SPOILER: Jigsaw tells Angus McFadden to exact a pound of flesh any way he choses, Jigsaw has killed lots of people so lets just cut him on the neck.. no torture.. (I mean they had to end the movie right? it was getting long).<br/><br/>6) There were lame scenes that were added to move the story along but in retrospect served no purpose. Like when Jigsaw thinks of his lover or when the detective got her ribcage ripped out. Lets not forget Donnie Walberg, who had potential to be something great in this movie.. but I guess he walked off the set so they just mentioned what happened to him. If you show an actor... show what happens to him. If he walks off the set and cant finish what he started...please edit his scenes out.<br/><br/>7) The last tape recorder about his daughter being captured was rushed and out of place.<br/><br/>I am not some fat guy with a pony tail ranting about a movie cause I have nothing better to do (or maybe I am, what does it matter?) but when I saw the 7 out of 10, i didn't want people to get tricked like I did.<br/><br/>I guess the only real plot twist was that this movie was made by music video directors and not a Hollywood movie crew."

It was so so so so much gorier than the first two. I was flinching the whole way through this movie, especially the brain operation scene, gah! Nmgah! I can't even describe an English word for that scene. The contraptions are scarier and seeming more impossible to get out of in the third installment, and while we do have a main story, this Saw seemed more focused on grossing people out.<br/><br/>The jigsaw killer is back, but the first three games seem impossible to get out of and ends up killing everyone. We find out that the jigsaw killer is also very sick with a brain tumor and Amanda kidnaps a doctor with a troubled marriage and family, she has a contraption on her head, in order for her to live, she has to keep the jigsaw killer alive. In the mean time, there is a game going on in the same building with a man who has sworn vengeance on anyone who hurts his family, including the death of his son and to kill the man who ran him over.<br/><br/>The story was an average contender considering how well put together the first Saw was, it was good, just didn't thrill me as much as the first or second one did. It just seemed like the sequels were more based on grossing people out though, but I can guarantee you though that Saw III has more gore!

","Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is back but, at this point, he is slowly dying. He's in a secret hiding place aided by his assistant Amanda (Shawnee Smith). Amanda kidnaps a brilliant doctor (Bahar Soomekh) to keep him alive so he can play one more game with a man (Angus Macfayden) who is seeking vengeance for his dead son. But there's more here than meets the eye.<br/><br/>Like the first two this is grim, brutal and VERY bloody including a graphic brain surgery sequence that almost made me bolt from the theatre. Again it questions Jigsaw's right to kill people who don't respect their lives...or others. But it also ties up some loose ends left in ""Saw 1"" and ""2"". It especially gives more information on Amanda and who she is and why she helps Jigsaw. It also provides a solid ending for part 2. I don't think there's ever been a case when two sequels to a movie are just as good as the original! The ""Godfather"" movies didn't do it and neither did ""Scream"". This may be the first time ever.<br/><br/>The acting is just great. Bell (as always) is good and Smith is just incredible--she comes barreling off the screen and takes no prisoners. Her character goes through some incredible changes and Smith pulls them off. Macfayden is also good but given little to do (I was amused when his accent slipped a few times) and the same with Soomekh.<br/><br/>Like the first two this left me shaken--it really grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go. If you haven't seen the first two don't bother with this--you won't be able to follow it. Also avoid if graphic blood and gore bother you. Naturally most of the critics have been trashing this--dismissing it as sadistic and pointless. There are a few out there though who can see it's not just another sick horror film--it has a plot and a point. The graphic violence is necessary for the integrity of the picture. Very disturbing but fascinating too. An 8 all the way--I can't give it a 10 because I can't say I enjoyed the film."

Meanwhile Jigsaw has set up yet another complex game involving a guy named Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) whose son was killed in a road accident, Jeff is given the choice to save those he blames for his sons death from Jigsaw's killer traps & in turn save his own life...<br/><br/>Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman I have to say I really rather liked Saw III even though I didn't like the original that much, I admit right here & now that I haven't seen Saw II (2005) but I don't think it particularly matters as I don't think Saw III directly follows on from it. First of all Saw III is another one of those films where there are a couple of versions floating around, a theatrical 'R' rated cut & the obligatory Unrated version which is the one I will be basing my comments on & is apparently a good 5 or 6 minutes longer. The script by Leigh Whannell who plays Adam in the film takes itself very seriously but moves along at a nice enough pace, there are a few neat twits & turns in there with the ending being particularly effective in my humble opinion & thankfully it doesn't shortchange us in the exploitation department either with some serious gore & torture scenes which some may find disturbing or sick although from a personal point of view I can't get enough of this stuff & the gorier & more sadistic the better. There are only a few character's in the film & their pretty well fleshed out, the dialogue is OK & as a whole the story is very satisfying with some memorable scenes like the part where Judge Halden is buried alive under a river of minced up rotten pigs intestine's & flesh, I don't know how similar this is to Saw II if at all because I haven't seen it but it's different enough from the original Saw (2004) to not feel that familiar & while overall it may not be a better film I thought it was more entertaining.<br/><br/>Returning from Saw II director Bousman does a fine job, this has some nice colour schemes & has it's fair share of stylish moments although some of them are a little MTV-ish for my liking. This has some nice horror scenes in it with good tension, there's a nice dark atmosphere running throughout the film & of course there's some top gore in the Unrated version. People have their heads shot off, their rib cages pulled apart, people's limbs are twisted & broken complete with fractured bones bursting out of the skin, someone has huge hooks driven into their skin so they resemble something out of Hellraiser (1987), feet are bashed in & torn off, there is plenty of blood splashed around the place, there's one of the best slit throats I can remember seeing as someone uses a band-saw to slice someone's throat open, someone is shot in the neck with much spurting of blood as a result & my favourite part when Lynn graphically performs DIY brain surgery on Jigsaw using a power drill & a band-saw in a scene pretty much as explicit as they come. Most of the special effects seemed like actual on-set physical make-up effects rather than CGI which is another reason it looks so good. Saw III definitely satisfies in the gore department & for that I salute it! Just make sure you see the Unrated version although I think that's the version most commonly available pretty much everywhere.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of a modest sounding $10,000,000 Saw III wasn't going to able to compete with the mega budget Hollywood stuff but the filmmakers obviously used what they had well, it's well made throughout with impressive gore effects, sets & high production values. The acting is alright from a largely unknown cast (unknown to me anyway).<br/><br/>Saw III is an excellent film in my opinion, it has some great gore scenes, it has some nice twists & turns & as a whole it's pretty interesting & entertaining. One of the better horror films of recent times I'd say & definitely well worth a watch for those with the stomach. Again directed by Bousman Saw IV (2007) will apparently be released latter this year around Halloween time..."

","Before you even go see Saw III, make sure you've seen the first two. If you haven't it may not even be worth your time. You'll have more questions than answers if you don't come in prepared and I would have to say a vast majority of the plot will not make sense.<br/><br/>People who enjoyed Saw I where most likely intrigued by the mystery and shocking conclusion. It was a slow deliberate story that amazed even the most apathetic of viewers with it's originality. Saw II lacked the mystery, but established a legacy by thrilling it's veterans with a face to face sit down with Jigsaw and his lair. Saw III continues the story and unlike the previous films before, the audience knows what is in store from the very start.<br/><br/>Nothing can surprise the audience after Saw I and II's ending, in fact it's almost as if they know Jigsaw's motives - they don't however know Amanda's. Amanda as Jigsaw's apprentice brings a new direction into the movie, but it's nothing groundbreaking and her general character is laid out in the first twenty minutes. Besides her small screwball twists, you know the plot already - doors being opened will trigger horrific violence and breaking the rules will cost a person dearly. In fact, this is the first of the Saw films where you can actually piece together the proper ending before it happens. Some may call it a poor script, myself I would say the movie accomplished its goal.<br/><br/>From start to finish, the audience is engaged. Scene changes from one center of action happen seamlessly and almost any questions from the first two movies are answered. Unlike the other Saw's the ceremonial red drape covering Jigsaw's plots is gone. A simple symbolism of the audience being familiar with his works and knowing full well what is in store for them. And that is what I would say the film's goal was, for you to fully understand what Jigsaw is doing and how he accomplishes it.<br/><br/>In short: See Saw III to finish the story and to get a peak at what the fourth installment may be about, but don't expect it to be better than Saw I. Although the amount of gore far surpasses the first two combined and you may find yourself at times hard pressed not to turn your head away. Ans as always if you expect ultra-realism you'll find enough holes to ruin any movie, including this one."

","Crisp, violent, and completely engaging, Darren Lynn Bousman's Saw III is a horror sequel at the top of its franchise's game. Fitting like a puzzle piece into the scheme of the larger series, this third chapter finds its protagonists clashing in a cat and mouse game of traps and morality while the game's Svengali lies dying. Bousman imbues the work with sickly glow that juxtaposes a near graceful intricacy of scene and story. The work is pulpy and gruesome, but it is gripping and cracklingly constructed."

","The 3rd film in the Saw franchise is where a we get a more action packed and has some of saws best and it's unique telling of the events from the prevous 2 movies we also see how amanda was trained in the art of jigsaw and how she became crazy. the cast is Tobin Bell,Shawnee Smith,Angus Macfadyen,Bahar Soomekh, Donnie Wahlberg,Dina Meyer,Leigh Whannell,Mpho Koahok,Lyriq Bent, and Costas Mandylor by far they are the best cast of villians and those that are being tested by jigsaw and the traps are more complex and cool and wether they are investgating or in the traps. By far one of the best of the series you have to admit with off the twists and turns that happen they are always following along with the classic feel of saw movie this one has to be the best in the series and nothing can compare to this one in the series."
"ajourneywithjake","8","0","2","2 November 2017"," Best Saw Film so Far
","The reason why this film is my favorite Saw film so far was that it really focused on the characters. Instead of using an overabundance of gore or morbidity, which is surprisingly minimal (for a Saw film), the challenges that the game player, Jeff, faces involve being able to learn to forgive. Granted one of these is beyond gross, but at the same time Jeff has to deal with emotional pain free from physical pain in order to advance in the game. I found that to be very clever. The plot also has plenty of surprises that are set up well throughout the film and result in some really great on screen revelations. The characters' interactions during these scenes are also great and have a lot of emotion and significance behind them. I feel that the definition of tragedy in the Shakespearean sense is put on display in this film in a textbook example. The film has the characteristic bleak and grungy Saw settings, but they fit the story well. If you've been watching the series this long and aren't just jumping in then they are almost to be expected at this point. The film was created very well and has pretty good cinematic quality. Most of all, it has a decent moral message to it that most horror movies don't have or attempt but can't achieve.<br/><br/>You can read this and other reviews on my blog at https://ajourneywithjake.wordpress.com/"
"kylemcdavid-27399","7","0","2","30 October 2017"," Probably the last good sequel
","Saw III, here we go, this is in my opinion the last good film in the Saw Franchise, and to me is my second favorite in the series.<br/><br/>Basically John Kramer, the original Jigsaw Killer, is about to meet his fate from his Brain Tumor's issue, and Amanda Young, his only assistant must search for help to cured his severe problem, so she kidnaps an Doctor who was originally an assistant of Kramer's ex-doctor, to figured-out an way to end it. Meanwhile, an new victim, who lost his son from an DUI Incident a few years prior, and ever since then felt vengeful towards his killer, must plays Jigsaw's game to shows him that Forgiveness exists, by coming upon a few more Victims in traps who are in any way connected to his Son's death, and it his choice of letting them live or Die because of what they do with his personal incident.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie, I got to admit is a-bit better than some of the ones in Saw II. John Kramer and Amanda Young are still interesting to watch, the Doctor is a-bit forgettable however, but her relationship with Amanda was kinda nice to see. The Vengeful Father, was in my opinion, a very interesting character, just having someone who is really vengeful about someone who he seems to loves a-lot is great to see and his search for he thinking will be his Son's killer during the game Jigsaw have him participate in was enjoyable like a snack. The traps in this movie are again good, and once again I have a favorite, this time is The Rack, which was pretty intense of a scene, probably remained my second favorite trap in the whole series along-side the Amanda Young's trap from the first one. Now I have said positive things about this film, that does not means there aren't any negative things to say, there is unfortunately. Firstly is the Kristy's trap (Kristy by-a-way is a character from the previous film who is a former partner of the Juvie's father of an Corrupt Detective) which is shown to be unnecessary in this film as they never mentioned it the rest of the film, and they only continued it's story in the following one, it just seems like they just wants to show us a trap already but this is the third Installment and according to the first two films, we already know there going to be traps like that, so what the point? Secondly, this is what a-lot of people would kinda agree which is the ending, now a-lot people complains by saying it was all an mistake, but honestly it not really like that which I have an problem with, it just the craze it shows to people who watches that then make them confused about how there will be sequels in which this started the downhill of the series with the follow-up ""Saw IV"". Personally, I thought this would've been an good way to end the series because there obviously no other way to continued, but then they decide to do that anyways by releasing the ever god-awful fourth film.<br/><br/>Now I would recommend this if you only see the first Saw movie, if you didn't see Saw II, it really doesn't matters, because the whole twist they pull off with Amanda turning out she was an Assistant not an victim this time was pretty much almost spoiled by it's trailer. This movie, along with the first Saw film, are like the only ones I would probably sit around and watch again, I absolutely loves this one."

","So,Saw obviously was not over when Darren decided to create Saw 3:The Final Chapter..I wish I could say that now. Saw III follows a new group of guilty people who've done guilty things and now,Jigsaw has captured them and is now,giving them a chance to learn from their mistakes. Saw III,when I heard,obviously,I was not excited really,its just another dumb sequel I told my friends but oh no,people like them just had to see it because they wanted to see it,when I was watching Saw III,I was really bored..I was,that's before when Saw III became the most coolest,amazingest horror film ever,well..not ever. Saw III had brilliant writing and for some reason,that's actually something really good about the Saw films,there really is not one that has weak writing(well,except for Saw VII,or course). The acting in the film is probably why I'm giving this a nine,look,I'm not going to say that it was awful but the acting could have been better but I guess that's Saw,not really any of the films,except for one and two,have great acting but,Saw III is a very good well crafted horror film"
"destinylives52","7","0","2","13 May 2017"," Third Installment Is Still Going Strong
","And the gore and traps and plot twists keep going in the ""Saw"" franchise with part III. Tobin Bell and Shawnee Smith reprise their roles as Jigsaw and his ex-junkie understudy, respectively. Bell is at death's door, so he enlists the help of Smith to kidnap a doctor to help keep him alive as he plays his last game, which presumably is the testing of an emotionally broken man played by Angus Macfadyen. So here we have multiple themes/story lines happening, adding layers of depth that makes this — and previous ""Saw"" movies — a level up from the many rip-offs out there.<br/><br/>First we have the complex relationship between Bell and Smithteacher-student, father-daughter, perhaps lovers depending on which side you focus on. Then there is the Macfadyen story: a husband blinded by rage to the point he has mentally abandoned his familywill he sacrifice everything to feed his rage and vengeance, or can he forgive and start living again? The doctorcan she snap out of her daze (induced by drugs and an unhappy marriage) to keep a maniac alive without proper medical equipment? And of course, there are the plot twists and surprise ending.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Saw III"" is the scene when a man's head and limbs are held in independently twisting, vise-like devices. The key to freedom is guarded by a shotgun, and as the seconds tick by, the man's limbs are slowly turned until bones, ligaments, and tendons break and snap. Ouch! <br/><br/>""Saw III"" does have plot holes and inconsistencies, which I refer to as shenanigans; but the clever and gory traps/puzzles, fast pace, twists and surprises, and some thought-provoking themes more than compensate for said shenanigans. For fans of this horror sub-genre, prepare to cringe, laugh, feel queasy, and have fun.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"

","While the Saw series is often (incorrectly, I feel) blamed for the goring-up of horror films and credited with starting the torture porn genre, something you'll notice if you watch the first two installments in the series is that they're fairly restrained and not as exploitive as some might expect. Saw III, on the other hand, is where the films stopped restraining themselves with the violence and adopted a policy of ""keep showing! Show everything! More blood!!"" This is not bad in and of itself, but I do feel like people more critical of the film are distracted by that and can't see that this film has much more story and character than the give it credit for. In this film, a doctor played by Bahar Soomekh is told she has to keep a dying Jigsaw alive while a man, played by Angus Macfadyen, goes from room to room confronting people he believes responsible for his son's death and has to choose to either let the people in the traps die, or to forgive them and set them free. The film's biggest strength is in its characters. You really feel for and understand Macfadyen's character and the tragedy of his situation and it's really hard to watch him go through his tests and face his own personal demons. Equally compelling is the Amanda-Jigsaw relationship, which is very unique for a horror film like this and the scenes they have together are the type you don't expect from a saw film, with Jigsaw reassuring Amanda that he believes in her worthiness to carry on his work in a very father-daughter like manner, with some very subtle characterization. In summary, the film has good characters, a some compelling and interesting drama and character dynamics, even going to far to explore the small difference between what Jigsaw does and what a straight-up murderer does, and the twists are just as compelling as you would expect from these movies at this point. I really wish they hadn't felt the need to be as gory with it as they did, since I think more people would be more open to the film. As is, the film is in my top 3 of the series, along with Part 6 and Part 1."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","17 September 2016"," Effective In Only Bits n Pieces Yet Suffices As A Serviceable Sequel
","Filmed on a bigger budget yet lacking the creativity that made the original click so well, the third instalment in the Saw series takes the usual elements of its predecessors and magnifies it by an extent but the end result is still the same old story as before and remains on par with the second entry.<br/><br/>Saw III covers two story lines that merge in the end. The first concerns an anguished man who's put through a series of ""tests"", each meant to bring him closer to the person responsible for the death of his son. The second follows Jigsaw who has his apprentice kidnap a doctor and instructs her to keep him alive for one final test.<br/><br/>Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman, Saw III is virtually the same stuff all over again and even though there is an attempt to bring an emotional dimension into the story, it doesn't really stick for long. It does crank up the voltage though when it comes to violence n gore and is more stomach-churning than its predecessors but that's expected.<br/><br/>The flashbacks cover the backstories of Jigsaw & his apprentice as well as their time together but there are so many of them that it disrupts with the narrative flow and kills the tension more times than one. Performances stay on same level as before with Tobin Bell again doing a pretty neat job while the rest just chip in with fine supporting work.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Saw III features a plot that's more far-fetched than the last time but still packs enough brutality to satisfy those who especially came looking for it. The discrepancies caused by its constantly shifting focus & irregular pacing do result in a fractured narrative that's only effective in bits n pieces but in the end, it suffices as a serviceable sequel, if not a rewarding one."
"bluegattaca","7","0","1","8 November 2015"," Not as good as the first
","This movie has some flashbacks and explains how the 1st movie was setup. Amanda brings in female doctor (Lynn) to help Jigsaw stay alive until the next guy (Jeff) gets through his game. A device is put on her to make her comply and is linked to Jigsaws heart monitor. The main character Jeff is trapped in jigsaws game encounters people that let his son die. The witness that ran, judge, and the killer himself. He tries to free 1st one but she froze, judge he saves but has to burn his sons things to get the key. Jeff taking his time through the ordeal even though he has limited time. This movie is more gruesome than the other two and is the last of what I consider the classic saw trilogy. Jigsaw dies at the end of the movie and you can pretty much not watch any of the others after this one. Ending was bitter sweet. Amanda betrays jigsaw and she doesn't want them to live and refuses to take off the devise and Jeff comes in and shoots her. It is revealed that unknown to Amanda (and the viewers) that Jeff and Lynn are husband and wife and that the man Lynn was with at the beginning of the movie was just some guy she was cheating on him with when the viewers assume it's her husband. Everyone dies at the end and jigsaw reveals in a tape that Jeff's little girl is trapped."
"kannibalcorpsegrinder","5","0","1","26 October 2015"," Decent entry, if not overly spectacular effort
","Kidnapped from her hospital routine, a doctor is gathered by Jigsaw and his disciple to keep him alive as they run another man through their rigorous game and finds the situation more strenuous and challenging than she expected.<br/><br/>This was an incredibly flawed film with a couple crippling flaws and hardly anything to keep it afloat. One of the really only good things about this is the fact that the first traps in the beginning are rather cool and impressive-looking which is pretty nice, getting some solid moments to start this one off. As one is forced into position with hooked chains on almost every joint in the body, and from there must remove them before a bomb goes off is really nice, while another that has a rib-spreader device attached to the entire chest is also quite brutal. Coupled with the later ones which aren't traps but have evolved to be simply scenarios which must be stopped before being played out to the gruesome end, from the freezing room and the sludge pit while the big centerpiece sequence where the victim is trapped to a violent limb- twister that slowly rips every limb around in unrealistic manners that makes for a messy and gory sequence, and this one scores nicely on its traps. As well, this one also gets rather fun here in how it sells the logistics of the twist which showcases several roving plot-threads at once which signal a much more involved and complex story here that comes off really nicely showing the whole plan as a lot more complex than expected. The only other thing that works, which is the surgery scenes, which are disturbing, freaky and a little unsettling, which are film's good points since this has some big flaws. The first is that there's plenty of time in here spent on useless moments. This is most evident in the scenes of the three in the makeshift hospital arguing or yelling at each other, and their conversations about the most useless facets of the situation go on so often that it just becomes so unbearable it's hard to get into the scenes. This also affects the scenes showing the back-story, as there's no need to show the set-ups of how the traps were concocted from before in the series, as it's not that exciting and takes away from the film by going behind-the-scenes of what's already known. It makes the nonevent of the torturing in here standout even more, and that's two really big problems that come from this. There's no need for them since there's too many of them to begin with and it's time taken up with useless scenes in a situation where it's unnecessary to be that way, and here it stays so low and nonessential that having them in there is a detriment to the film, as well as taking up valuable time from the film for such a useless part. The traps are fun, but there's hardly any in the film, taking a backseat to the relationship, and as a whole nothing in here seems important. It just leaves a feel of disinterest in what has happened, from the traps to the pacing to just about everything in here. As well, this one also comes across with the feeling of his own brand of punishment being too far self-centered that there's little to gleam from the ethics and morality found here which tends to come away rather whole-heartedly here. These here are the film's flaws.<br/><br/>Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Nudity."
"rjsf96","6","0","2","19 April 2015"," Saw: The Bloodbath Edition
","It is telling of our culture that 'Saw III' is the highest grossing film of the franchise. It also possesses the largest quantities of blood, until 'Saw: The Final Chapter'. If you are going into Saw III expecting a deep, complex, held back horror, then this is surely not the film for you.<br/><br/>Jigsaw's now on death's door. He has the help of his newly appointed apprentice Amanda. She will carry out his remaining traps and ensure that his life's work goes on, even without him. This time he tasks Amanda with kidnapping Lynn Denlon, who works at the local hospital. Lynn's objective is making Jigsaw survive long enough to see the outcome of another victim and his tests set before him. Jigsaw's next victim is Jeff who is filled with vengeance after the death of his beloved son who was hit by a car. The driver left as quickly as possible and Jeff has no room in his heart for pity, kindness or redemption. Jigsaw figures that it is now Jeff's time to be tested. Jeff has three tests, tests of forgiveness for the witness, judge and suspect. Jeff must complete his tests in the allotted time or be trapped in the abandoned factory to die in.<br/><br/>'Saw III' contains some of the franchise's most vile traps and the only effective sentimental one. It's an odd mix. But the filmmakers manage to pull it off. People, who have seen the film, will know which traps I am referring to and they occur within the first fifteen minutes. Bring a bucket. The classroom trap needs some description, however brief in order to explain it. The victim in this instance is a convict by the name of Troy. Jigsaw believes him to be ""more comfortable in chains, than you are in freedom"". Troy has chains linked to almost every body part; he will need to rip them out of himself before the bomb detonates. The thing is even if he did make it in time; he would not escape the room alive. The door was sealed shut and the Police had to break it down through force. Detective Kerry who has been on the case since the first killing, decides this is not the work of Jigsaw but an imitator.<br/><br/>The same thing happens again. The victim is harnessed into a device that is hooked into her ribcage. She grabs the key out of a vat of acid. It does not matter. The device will not budge. This is the work of perhaps the very same imitator earlier.<br/><br/>These traps are not effective. Well in a sense they are, you are sure to feel nauseous. But they are devised for shock value. They do not have half of the weight found in the original because they involve gallons of blood. The only factor that makes them worthwhile is Jigsaw's instructions to the victims. His rasping voice is absorbing to listen to. If only the same could be said of the traps.<br/><br/>There is one though that resonates throughout the series. In one of Jeff's tests, the judge is in a huge metal container, lying on his back. It is slowly filling up with the guts of pigs. The only way Jeff can retrieve the key is by burning his son's toys. The look of pain on Jeff's face is palpable and highlights that you do not need to have a barrel full of blood to make an impact on the audience.<br/><br/>The acting here is shockingly the best of the series. Angus Macfayden as Jeff is the right amount of disturbing, never under or overplaying to his horrifying predicament. Shawnee Smith as Amanda undoes her excruciating performance from 'Saw II' and for sure is better served in her scenes with the deranged Jigsaw. Tobin Bell brings his character to life and offers the only humanity that can be garnered from someone this psychotic.<br/><br/>'Saw III' oversteps the mark frequently. The gore is often far too much to handle and the first couple of traps derivative at best. But once Jeff's game begins, the film hits its bloody stride and delivers fans with a hard-core horror with well-defined characters (for the main cast), who would have thought it? As well as a surprisingly thoughtful story and great acting (for a horror film at least.) If only more Horror sequels were this entertaining, in a sadistic way."
"badfeelinganger","10","0","2","7 March 2015"," Saw III is an adequate sequel A study in grief, guilt and human frailty
","Though there's little doubt that these films will keep getting made until they stop making money, Saw III reportedly marks the last hurrah for the original filmmakers - including series creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell (with the latter penning the expectedly intricate screenplay). It comes as no surprise, then, that Saw III generally has the feel of a final instalment - although, of course, the door is nevertheless left open for yet another sequel.Director Darren Lynn Bousman has infused Saw III with precisely the same sort of dark, Fincheresque sensibility that has essentially come to define the series' visual look, a feeling that's been augmented with the distinctly gritty vibe (the film is much, much more brutal than either of its predecessors). Whannell's script features several references to both Saw and Saw II, and occasionally paints certain events from those two films in an entirely new light (that infamous bathroom set makes a welcome appearance, albeit briefly). There's little doubt that Saw III will have a far greater effect on viewers who are already well acquainted with the series, as the filmmakers have included a whole host of little tidbits and shout-outs that will mean absolutely nothing to neophytes (that being said, the central storyline does seem accessible enough to hold the interest of newbies). And if ever there was a movie that warranted a ""not for the squeamish"" advisory, this is certainly it."
"skybrick736","6","0","1","14 January 2015"," Saw III
","Saw III is a good contributing part of the Saw franchise since it keeps intertwining the previous films together like a puzzle itself. The story lines and twist endings with Saw III is definitely the reason to watch this relatively sub-par horror flick. It's quite remarkable how well each twist is, even though the viewer might be able to sniff some of them out, they keep on providing surprise after surprise. The actors in the film are alright, some really bad script dialog and overacting (especially Shawnee Smith) but not unbearable. The Saw films however are best viewed in sequential order in short periods of time to pick up past characters, subplots and tidbit hints. I'd have to say Saw III (6/10) didn't hold up to its previous successors but it manages to be a fun ride."

The gruesome torture scenes are creative and original, and the effects, what they do to make us believe that all this might just be real because it looks like it is just brilliant. If you think the director has run out of trap ideas, believe me when I tell you that there are plenty of traps that caused horror movie fanatics to cringe when it comes into play.<br/><br/>It is has much gore, more than the other SAW movies.

","It manages to explain events in Saw 1 and 2 that may have been considered plot holes. It's the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. It's not perfect, though. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. Some of the dialog could be better. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. This is probably the worst of the sequels, with nothing to laugh at. By the end of the movie, the audience clapped. We liked what we had seen."

","One thing I wanna say before I dive into the movie: John Kramer aka Jigsaw is a god.<br/><br/>This is the best Saw movie I've seen so far (in terms of the first 3). There is so much I can say about this movie that makes it perfect but then I'd literally be spoiling everything. This whole movie is a big spoiler.<br/><br/>The traps have definitely been the best so far. I read that Leigh Whannel who worked on the movie and also played Adam in Saw 1 cannot watch this movie without feeling nauseous because of what the traps do to their victims. I personally watched the whole movie without feeling anything except awe, but that's just me.

"Hey_Sweden","7","0","2","7 October 2012"," Gripping visceral entertainment.
","Third entry in the popular Lionsgate franchise of intense and graphic ""torture"" films catches us up to speed before soon diving into another insane Jigsaw mixture of heavy handed moralizing and brutal punishment. This time, we get two main concurrent story lines, as Jigsaws' protégé Amanda (Shawnee Smith) kidnaps a weary doctor, Lynn (Bahar Soomekh) whose purpose is to keep his sorry ass alive for as long as possible, and the latest in the line of unwilling game players turns out to be Jeff (Angus Macfadyen). Jeff lost his son when the latter was killed by a drunken driver, and he's been consumed with rage and a need for vengeance ever since. So, as we can see, Jigsaws' latest lesson to a slow learner is not to let hatred poison ones' heart. These story lines create a pretty compelling story that keeps one glued to the screen, and things get just mean spirited enough to appeal to some tastes if not all. Of course, the torture devices get more and more elaborate and sadistic, which will absolutely delight gore fanatics, as various extremely unpleasant things happen to a succession of victims. There's a strikingly detailed brain operation, a head that blows up real good, a body being drowned in pig innards, throats being sliced, body parts being mangled, bloody gunshot wounds, etc. The ""rack"" is particularly insidious, especially as it twists body parts around. One unfortunate thing is that assorted flashback scenes tend to bog the story down; they're good for establishing character, but also slow the pace too much. This is a noticeably long entry in the franchise, the theatrical cut running 108 minutes and the uncut version running 13 minutes longer than that. Another thing that could trouble some viewers with this franchise is a lack of sympathetic characters, although others may appreciate the fact / point that the people in these stories are markedly flawed and not perfect. The crew, including production designer David Hackl and cinematographer David Armstrong, once again prove up to the challenge of shooting in some claustrophobic sets, and things look as grim and grimy as they ever have. The cast is deeply committed as per usual, including Tobin Bell as the sickly Jigsaw, hot 80s icon Betsy Russell in the first of her performances as Jigsaws' wife, and series regulars like Dina Meyer, Costas Mandylor, and Lyriq Bent. Series fans should like what they see, while the faint of heart and weak of stomach should stay far away. Seven out of 10."
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","6","0","3","14 December 2011"," Saw III (2006)
","The Saw series continues to surprise me. Since they are churned out so quickly and written even faster, you'd expect these films to become more and more pathetic. However they don't, Saw III holds up along with the last two by keeping the same style and formula but furthering the story in terms of character. It isn't often we see good development of killers in horror movies. Mostly because more development means they lose some of their mystery and menace. However, with Saw, I feel understanding Jigsaw is part of the pleasure. This time a man must set aside his vengeance and forgive those responsible for his son's death. Mainly these films are about gore and this film has plenty of that, even some teeth grittingly painful moments. Brilliant gory entertainment for any night of the week."
"Hysteria28","7","0","3","29 November 2010"," Better than the sequel
","Darren Lynn Bosman returns to direct his second Saw movie. Saw 3 continues Jigsaw killer's games. His accomplice Amanda returns to assist him in his gruesome games. This movie's uncut version is 2 hours in duration. But the cut version has around 12 minutes of graphic violence edited. Those who will search for more blood and gore will be satisfied. All elements are present in the movie that were lacking in the original and sequel. There is also an improvement to the plot in comparison to the sequel. As the sufferer of cancer, Jigsaw has become bed ridden. But this does not prevent him from subjecting people to his torturous traps. While watching him I was confused whether to have pity for his character, or hate. He enjoys testing people's vulnerability and and patience. Through these means he intends to exert discipline. <br/><br/>SPOILERS Jigsaws suffering has worsened and he is in need of immediate brain surgery. His accomplice Amanda kidnaps a surgeon played by Bahar Soomekh. To her neck is tied a electronic 360 rotating gun. It is connected to his heart rate machine. If he dies, she too dies. She is instructed to perform a brain operation to remove the tuma that is growing. Meanwhile a grieving father(Jeff) who has lost his young son in a hit and run accident has fallen prey to Jigsaw's games. Along his journey he meets a judge, witness and killer of his son. Each individual is in a trap and it is his responsibility to choose whether to save the person or let them die. Jigsaw's tuma is removed and he instructs Amanda to release the trap from the surgeons neck. She refuses and kills the her. At the same time the father enters and discovers his wife wounded. He kills Amanda and Jigsaw. But later doing this he realises that his daughter is in a unknown location that only Jigsaw knew. END OF SPOILERS<br/><br/>This is a more enjoyable movie if compared to the sequel. Bahar Soomekh makes it worth watching. She is very convincing playing the role of the surgeon. But the twist seemed very predictable. I had figured out that she was the husband of Jeff. It was just a matter of time until we were notified. But this does make the climax predictable, only the element of surprising twists were less. For those fans of Saw who are looking for more ingenious traps will be pleased. The first sequence is gut wrenching as a man's legs and arms are clinched by a steel ring. It is also the first time in the franchise where there is some female nudity depicted. This came as a surprise. The strobe lighting and fast editing are becoming very annoying. There are large amounts featured in the movie which make it difficult to concentrate on a few scenes. I understand that it is an integral part of the movie and it's style, but there should be a limit to it. Dina Meyer playing officer Kelly is wasted in one murder scene. Her character is made extinct. But she could have been an asset to the franchise. I would have been more than happy to see her role continued."

","Saw is back for another installment in the series as Saw III carries on from Saw II however is it any good? The story is mediocre this time round and isn't very friendly to people who are watching the series for the first time. You'd have to watch the first two to actually make sense of the story. The characters aren't very well created except for Doctor Lynn and obviously John and Amanda who were in the first two movies. You didn't really feel connected much to the rest of the characters so you didn't really care much. The character development was okay but it was mainly between Amanda and John (or Jigsaw) as she starts to care for him like a daughter would care for her father, trying desperately to cure and heal him. The acting is average except for the talented Shawnee Smith as Amanda and Tobin Bell as Jigsaw, both of them were yet again brilliant and the relationship between them is great. The direction isn't bad and the writing is great except for the fact that the story is more for the people who watched the first two movies than newcomers. The special effects and the blood and gore were yet again realistic and the traps were inventive but there was one scene that I think could have pushed the blood and gore scenes a little too far.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed it. It's a good horror movie but it's definitely the weakest at the moment. Another thing that was bad was the amount of blood and gore in this one. Even though I'm okay with blood and gore scenes in movies, there was one scene in particular which made me feel uncomfortable watching because it went a little too far (you'll know which scene I'm talking about if you watch the movie) and I felt that the movie didn't really need to cross that line as the story was very good anyway. The twists and turns in the movie won't let you down however, as there are plenty of them in the story.<br/><br/>Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"

","The original SAW was a horror film that received wider acclaim because it not only appealed to fans of gore but had a very clever twist ending so much so that a couple o years after seeing it for the one and only time I can clearly remember the twist though not much else . I vaguely remember the sequel which might have had a not so clever twist ending but can remember the way several characters were killed off . Watching the third film in the franchise it's becoming clearer that the producers that the producers are less interested in cerebral plotting and more interested in taking "" torture porn "" to new limits along with its MTV style editing which quickly becomes annoying . Also I'm writing this in the Summer of 2010 there is a SAW 7 in the pipeline which means the impact of the ending where it looks like John Kramer and his understudy Amanda both die is negated knowing there's another 4 - at least - films to come <br/><br/>When you watch some of these video nasties that were banned in the early 1980s you might be shocked at how tame or cheesy they look compared to some mainstream horror films nowadays . Torture porn works down to both its conviction and cruelty . Pople plead , beg , cry and screech to be allowed to live but no one is listening or granting them mercy and its this callousness that disturbs the audience . SAW 3 does this very well , perhaps too well as people mutilate themselves vainly trying to escape the lair of the Jigsaw murderer . The problem is that it's the storyline only exists to shock the audience . People turn up in the lair which leads you to acknowledge how contrived the story is . They all tie in with Jeff and his wife whose son was killed in a hit and run . Surely they must have all been kidnapped on the same day ? I mean if someone is confined to "" the rack "" then they wouldn't have access to water and they'd die of thirst ? Likewise the victim in the freezer ? If Amanda is taking care of business in the ad hoc surgery then who is operating the water system . Surely the victim would have frozen to death before Jeff reached her ? You see how the time frame doesn't stand up to scrutiny ? <br/><br/>Of course you don't watch horror films expecting cerebral writing or profound subtext and in an exercise in shocking its audience SAW 3 does the job well with its gory death scenes . But after seeing it you wonder how far the franchise can go after this and even here there's a strong feeling that the rot is truly starting to set in"

","Saw III isn't that bad. It's just that after an amazing Saw and a great Saw II, it comes out as a disappointment. The acting is decent, like in most Saw movies. Shawnee Smith has a different approach to her character: she acted well in this movie, and I did feel sorry for Amanda throughout this movie. Angus Macfadyen is okay as Jeff, though I didn't really like his character. He turned out to be plain dumb at the end of the movie. Tobin Bell is excellent, needless to say he's probably one of the only actors who will never disappoint in a Saw movie, and sadly to say, some of the best acting moments come from Lyric Bent, who has two minutes or so in the movie and Donnie Wahlberg who has close to five minutes in the movie. The girl who played Lynn was just plain awful.<br/><br/>The story is well written, but it comes out as pure torture-porn, with each ''test'' being an excuse to show as much blood, gore and guts as possible. It has a decent ending however, but it just doesn't make up like the first two. The traps themselves are cool, but to me it takes more than just traps, blood, gore and guts to make a Saw movie. Overall, this is a disappointment, though I probably wouldn't mind watching it again, but it's not the type of movie I would buy."

","With it's bloody violence, interesting characters, and a solid script, 'Saw III' keeps the franchise sharp and going strong.It picks off after 'Saw II' where Detective Matthews was locked in the bathroom used in the very original.This sequel opens with him trying to get out of his shackle and you probably know how he gets out if there's no key and all you see is a hacksaw and a big rock.A nurse named Lynn is captured by one of Jiggsaw's accomplices for a very important reason.The Jigsaw killer( AKA John Kramer) has been having some really bad problems involving his head and now he puts his faith in Lynn to save him.You probably think that Lynn is just going to kill Jigsaw and his accomplice and just escape.That is where you are wrong if that was what you were thinking.Lynn has a device strapped to her neck that is basically a bomb.This neck-brace will detonate if John dies or she is out of range of John.So she has no choice and must help John if they both want to live.Meanwhile, John has a trick up his sleeve.He kidnaps Jeff, a man who is still mourning the loss of his son.When he is captured, he is given tasks by Jigsaw that involves the revenge that he has always wanted on his son's killer.If he can get through his tasks in 2 hours and Jigsaw is still alive, Lynn and Jeff can go free.That's pretty much the premise of 'Saw III' and I can say that it wasn't a bad one at all.Add some gruesome death scenes to this movie and you have yourself a darn good horror film that has you begging for more.Be sure to check out the unrated version."
"KineticSeoul","7","0","1","28 October 2009"," A gorier sequel with a good twist
","Wow if you thought the first two ""Saw"" movies were gory, it gets even more gorier and just might please some hardcore ""Saw"" fans. The set up was well done and the torture devices are more hardcore this time around. But the main aspect I didn't like about the 3rd installment is how it revealed Jigsaw to be more of a prick, cause in the first two installments he was in the gray, but now it reveals he is leaning more to the dark side. But you feel a bit compassionate towards him in the end cause of Amanda, who is his accomplice. She is one evil emo junkie who is very hypocritical and that just about sums her up. So basically the only reason she survived Jigsaw's game in the first place besides the fact that the game that is set up for her was way too easy compared to other torture devices Jigsaw set up for his other victims, but Jigsaw actually plays fair and keeps his word. If he didn't Amanda's head would be in smithereens and yet she sets up her own torture devices in a way where that is not winnable. And doesn't learn her lesson, she destroys 4 lives and one of them was a female police officer named Kerry, who really didn't do anything wrong. And just lived a life where she was dead on the inside, which isn't anything comparable to Amanda who was a drug addict and gets a kick out of cutting herself. So you want Amanda's death to be gruesome as possible but she just gets shot in the neck, which was a big disappointment. After Amanda kidnaps Lynn the surgeon to fix Jigsaw. It makes Jigsaw the old fart look like he is just trying to save his own life, while most of his victims die off. But at least it led to a brain surgery on Jigsaw which was gruesome to watch and some gore fans may get a kick out of it. I will admit that some of Amanda's quotes I had to agree on, like when she says ""what you do is no different than murder"" and ""She hasn't changed cause nobody changes"" which proves to be true cause Amanda is still a whinny girl that cuts herself. While the scenario of Jigsaw, Amanda and Lynn is going on, it goes back and forth to the scenario of Jeff, Jeff is a father that is semi psychotic after the loss of his son and doesn't show the amount of love to his daughter that he showed for his dead son. Anyways he got kidnapped as well and has to go through 3 test and each of the test it has a person who was involved in his sons death and through these test it is shown that Jeff is no better than the people involved in his son's death. First door leads to the witness that didn't do anything during the scene of the accident, so she isn't that bad but Jeff thinks she deserves to die and when he makes up his mind to save her she freezes to death. The second door leads to the Judge that gave the killer of Jeff's son a light sentence of just six month in prison, so Jeff has a reason to be angry at the guy but he ends up saving him. Than it comes down to the final door that leads to the murderer, but during the flashback scene it shows the guy accidentally ran over Jeff's son and felt guilty about it. Also a lot of blame goes to Jeff as well for not keeping a close eye on his son, and basically it's his son's stupidity that got him killed. As a parent he didn't even bother to teach his son to look both ways before crossing the road? Besides the fact that Jeff and Lynn use to be husband and wife it really didn't show why he was chosen although it was a decent combination. But if the origins of Jigsaw that is revealed in ""Saw 4"" was shown before part 3 or during it, it would have given the idea of why Jigsaw chose him, cause both there origins are somewhat similar. Although I doubt the creators of this film thought that much ahead. The first 30 min wasn't that good and felt like it was an excuse to add more gore into the movie, and also felt a bit repetitive. Also Jigsaw's moral speech about vengeance made me roll my eyes. It's one thing when a villain knows they are evil and sadistic, but Jigsaw is a man that convinces himself or thinks he is doing the right thing. And it feels like the image of Jigsaw is getting destroyed and gets weaker as a new sequel comes out and not just literally. Jeff seems to be kinda slow but he makes a really dumb decision at the end, but it was satisfying. The twist near the end about how the game mostly revolved around Amanda and how she was a contestant all along without her knowing was a nice touch as well, my only major problem about that is the fact that although While the previous 2 ""Saw"" movies had some hope for the victims, it isn't the case for this one. Jigsaw was all about teaching the victims a lesson about the value of life but most of the victims didn't have a chance for themselves but for someone else to make the decision for them if they should live or die. This is a worthy sequel that connects some of part 1 and 2 together, some by flashbacks and finishes off with a decent twist in the end. It's well worth a look for hardcore ""saw"" fans even if it isn't engaging as part 1 and 2.<br/><br/>7.3/10"

","Let the games explode. Despite liking the direction 'Saw II' took, 'Saw III' was actually an improvement over 'II.' (Still, the original 'Saw' was the best, but this is second best.) The only unfortunate thing I can report, after saying how much I liked this feature in the series, is: they didn't just take the gore to the next level, the exploded it on the screen (in some scenes, literally.) I have seen a lot of horror movies, a lot of the ""torture porn"" films, slasher ones, etc, and this ranks #1 as the goriest movie I have ever seen. And that's too bad. The writing, acting, suspense, mystery and dialogue make me want to watch it, but at the same time, it's, well, ""torture"" to get through. (Spoilers ahead, but only for those who haven't seen #1-2) The now established team of Jigsaw and Amanda once again take on multiple people to prove a point: appreciate life, letting go, moving on and understand forgiveness. It would take an article seventeen times this size to go through all the plot points, so, to sum it up, just read the previous sentence. Yet again, they are now falling over their so-called twists and connect-the-dots and once more they are prepping the audience for more 'Saw' chapters. Unfortunately, they should've ended it right here. (See the closing, forget the cliffhangers and you'll see why this would've been a wonderful closing.) I did really like this installment, but sadly, this will probably be the final viewing (of 3) I will have of it. The gore is really in excess here, and the one test towards the end, involving literal ""twists"" is the most gruesome of all (five, to date) 'Saw' films and probably one of the most heart-wrenching to see in any film."

","For some reason, I liked Saw III the most in the series. Don't ask me why. I am not one for blood and guts, and the third one has the most. I can only deal with blood and guts if it's in a Tarentino movie or a few others. I guess giving it a 9 out of 10 is a bit ridiculous considering the fact that they are Saw films. But the twist in Saw III is genius. The twist in all of the Saw films are pretty clever, but the one in Saw III is the best. Not that it ends on a good note, but that it just surprised me. Saw III is a bloody film and a bloody good time. It's a film that I can watch without covering my eyes, but sometimes I have to. There are some things I don't like to watch, like when Rorsach in Watchmen starts clobbering the pedophile in the head with a machete. I don't know if that actually happened, because I knew it was coming and didn't watch. I also don't like watching people get their stomach's ripped off, which happens in Saw III. I don't quite know why, but I think that Saw III was the best in the series. But be warned, the next film will be a disappointment. It sounds like i'm writing this from the past.

"hnt_dnl","9","0","1","11 August 2009"," The best SAW sequel!
","I believe the original SAW to be one of the most influential, creative horror films in recent years. I kind of liked SAW II and upon further viewing it gains points with me for being different from I, but having a solid story within itself, but I think it was the fact that II almost seemed ignore what happened in I and appeared like a totally different almost not even tied to I, except for the return of the character of Amanda and her role in the SAW franchise. Now, with part III, it all comes together! I see where II was going! And SAW III is even more satisfying than II because it forms a great ""conclusion"" to the ""trilogy"". I know there has been a IV and V since, but they both go too far with the SAW concept as far as I'm concerned. It should have ended with III.<br/><br/>Picking up about 6 months after the events of II, SAW III continues the story of John AKA Jigsaw (who was revealed as the villain at the end of SAW and Amanda (revealed as Jigsaw's apprentice at the end of SAW II). John/Jigsaw again is played superbly by Tobin Bell, who now belongs in the pantheon of the likes of Norman Bates, Jason Voorhies, Freddy Krueger, and Michael Myers. What makes John unique is that, unlike horror-movie killers of the last 30 years or so, he is portrayed as a functioning sociopath with an actual purpose and a rather focused vision: that people not take life for granted. Shawnee Smith again comes through as Amanda, who I thought was the most memorable character from part I. Now we get to see her character fleshed out and see her and John's relationship in full focus.<br/><br/>John has Amanda kidnap Dr. Lynn Denlon (played impressively by sexy newcomer Bahar Soomekh). Lynn is a brilliant ER surgeon, but seems to have a terrible personal life and is highly depressed. John needs Lynn to operate on him as his brain tumor is worsening and he is now bed-ridden. Scared out of her mind now by this situation, Lynn must comply as Amanda has placed a bullet-riddled contraption around her neck that if John dies, it goes off and she dies too! In a parallel story, John has taken Jeff (excellently portrayed by Angus Macfayden), another emotional basket-case who has recently lost his son, killed by a drunk driver, who was let off with a light sentence. John must navigate through his ""emotional"" trap of getting over his need for revenge on the people who are responsible for his rage (the driver, an eyewitness who said nothing, and the judge who let the driver go free).<br/><br/>The connection to III and I is that 2 people are imprisoned in one way or another and take life for granted. But here, both Lynn and Jeff are much more psychologically damaged than our protagonists Dr. Gordon and Adam in I. Of course there is a twist! Actually, there are 2 big twists! One of them occurs smack dab in the middle of the film and I like this one even better than the final twist, which is a doozy! While part I focused a lot on style and was short on exposition, this one digs deep into the psyche of it's 4 characters and involves us deeply into the experience.<br/><br/>Also, like in I, part III uses flashback sequences as part of the storytelling, but in I, the flashbacks were used more stylistically and dominated the film. Whereas here in III, the flashbacks are told in a more traditional fashion and placed at just the right time for just the right amount of exposition. But that is purposeful as each film has a different presentation: I was intended to be stylish, gimmicky, and nonlinear, whereas III has a story to tell. Again, the acting in III is exceptional. With a deeply involving story, SAW III is a highly welcome addition to the SAW franchise!"

","Jigsaw and his apprentice Amanda kidnap a doctor to keep Jigsaw alive while they play one last gruesome game.<br/><br/>Well it seems like we have another classic menacing serial killer franchise in our midst's and frankly Jigsaw is a welcomed addition to the hall of fame, up there with other horror franchise greats such as Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, Leatherface, Norman Bates and Ghostface. But unlike the others he doesn't actually kill his victims himself, instead he sets up his victims in gruesome traps and teach them how to value life, in which they don't as they mostly fail and end up dead in a truly gory fashion which is fantastic and original which I love.<br/><br/>The third movie in the franchise follows the successful and brilliant Part 1 and 2, and part 3 which is just as fantastic as the first 2. Where sequels usually jump shark round about this point, this one I'm glad to say doesn't they just keep coming up with fresh and astounding ideas which is definitely the reason why each movie keeps on becoming more and more successful. SAW III was akin to the more intimate and character driven approach of the original. SAW III was more than an assault of revelations and expansion on the franchise, it was also a vicious, gory beating, which I'm glad to say with each movie never loses the emotion and nerve racking of the previous efforts, I mean these are the type of movies that make you think and value your life it's as if Jigsaw is real, I mean if I ended up in one of those traps I would well and truly crap myself. Crueler and gorier than Part II but yet fuller, SAW III was the neck-snap the franchise needed to go out on! Tobin Bell plays Jigsaw/John with such flair I'm glad he didn't change the effectiveness/range that he displayed in all of the Jigsaw incarnations within this film and with each film we see more and more of him and he never loses that menacing charm, LOVED HIM. Shawnee Smith (Amanda) is again fantastic even better with each film showing more depth this time round I Love her. Angus Macfadyen (Jeff) was on the ball as the conflicted and mourning father forced into game where he has to make impossible choices. Bahar Soomekh (Lynn) was on and off for me but she did okay overall and Dina Meyer did well with her limited screen time.<br/><br/>All in all cleverly written packed with substance, strong characters, warped traps and hard to watch kills filled with gore which I loved and itwas incredibly ambitious sequel It addressed the whole franchise while having its own story to tell, a well and truly brilliant movie that packs a punch."

","""Saw III"" is a good example of how a second sequel can be equal or even better than the original. I'm pleased to say that I wasn't very into the Saw franchise but after giving it the chance I really believe it refreshed the Horror genre in the new millennium.<br/><br/>I'm an old school Horror fanatic and I wasn't very happy with new additions to the genre trying to imitate the 70's exploitation or 80's heavy use of gore.<br/><br/>Saw III is a combination of heavy gore, stylish direction, suspense, and very original plot twists.<br/><br/>The plot is similar to the previous films but this time the phrase ""breaking the rules"" takes a new meaning...<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to any Horror fan or for those who want to see quality overall.<br/><br/>I really liked Shawnee Smith and Bahar Soomekh on their roles; delivered great performances and perfectly represented the two different sides of behavior: evil and good (through redemption).<br/><br/>Tobin Bell owns the movie.<br/><br/>But I won't spoil these movie that will be surely enjoyed by those who like me, will give it a chance because it's now part of Horror Culture.<br/><br/>Also, I really think it should've ended here instead of making part IV and V."

","After the average Saw 2 i was kind of expecting the same for Saw 3, But how dreadfully wrong i was. Everything is unorthodox and completely unoriginal (like you haven't noticed already!) Saw 3 is a blatantly staggering misshaped concept of a failed saga- APART FROM NUMBER 1. The acting and sustainability has speedily decreased from the 1st and 2nd Saw movies. The acting only resembles of a poor quality and sticks like that for the whole 1 hour 50 minutes! The story remains horrible and absolutely stupid. All that ever happens and in which you see is blood, guts and gore throughout. Nothing with a twist or nerve-shredding appears. By the third you would have hoped Lynn Bousman would have toned different mixes and created something different but keeping within the contents of originality.<br/><br/>Sadly Saw 3 is a poor and absolute crap 'b' movie that shouldn't even be legal, and not for the graphic violent content."
"Jacques98","10","0","1","30 August 2008"," Incomparable.
","Oh. My. God.<br/><br/>I've made it my life goal to see every horror movie (mainly every gory horror movies) ever made. By now I've seen about 70% of them. I can't remember the last movie that made me cringe, it was so long ago. You could call me so desensitized that even the worst of the worst gore puts me to sleep---literally.<br/><br/>But then there is Saw III.<br/><br/>I've seen all of the other Saw movies, including Saw IV, but I never say this one until now because my ex wouldn't let me. I already knew the story. I already knew most of the gore scenes . . . and it still shocked me.<br/><br/>Unlike the boring, ungory Hostel: Part II, this movie is made for the MTV generation. It doesn't take time to characterize clichÃ© characters that could be copy/pasted from a hundred other movies, it doesn't start out slow and build ""suspense"" that isn't suspenseful, it's pretty much pure intensity from opening to finishing.<br/><br/>The gore is possibly some of the most intense gore I've seen in any movie to date. It's not as bloody as it could have been, but it's 1000x more brutal and creative than anything I've seen in any movie ever. And the lack of blood isn't because of a pansy director, it's because in the real situations there wouldn't be that much blood. Not to mention, this is one of the only movies I've ever seen where the camera does not blink once. No cut-off scenes, no pansy ""no show, but grueling sound effects! OMG!"", the camera simply does not blink away from the gore. Truly pornographic gore. Thank God someone has balls.<br/><br/>Gore aside, this has to be the single most intense movie I've ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>Bloody-disgusting.com thinks the new The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is intense, but, sorry, this makes that look childish. This makes both Hostels look childish. It makes the other Saw movies, including IV, look tame. The ending is intense I cried. ""She didn't change! Because no one ever f***ing changes! No one is reborn!"" The dialog, without any of the gore, alone makes the entire Hostel and Texas Chainsaw Massacre series combined look unexciting. I have simply yet to see a movie with more pure, unholy intensity.<br/><br/>Saw III is possibly the most perfect movie I've ever seen. I'm not sure if I like it more or less than Saw II, but it's certainly close. Everything reeks of polish and genius, but still keeps the low-budget feel.<br/><br/>Forget The Mist or The Decent or whatever horror crap you're watching: WATCH THIS MOVIE.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Jigsaw15","10","0","1","4 August 2008"," The best saw movie yet!!!!
","I not going to give anything away, but i must say that i think that the ending is the biggest ending, the build up to the twist(s) is perfect if you liked the first two you will love the third installment in the series. It is my favorite SAW movie yet, but i can't wait for SAW V! Director Darren Bousman has done a awesome job with the traps. This is the last SAW movie Leigh Whannell wrote, and he is a exalant writer. And another thing that I like (not just about SAW III) but SAW and SAW II as well you really get to know something about the people being tested so you can feel sorry for them and it's not just some random person being put through a Jigsaw test /game. However, I am a hardcore SAW fan so use your own judgement."
"Boba_Fett1138","9","0","2","1 August 2008"," Liked it beyond expectations.
","I liked ""Saw II"" as an horror-flick but not really necessarily as a Saw movie. ""Saw III"" is really more like it again and is featuring a great and original story, despite using some old concept and ingredients of the previous movie entries.<br/><br/>This movie perhaps even connects better to the first movie than ""Saw II"" did. Also story-wise. This movie somewhat gives a new spin to the first movie ""Saw"", since it also goes back to the events of the first movie, without spoiling too much. It makes ""Saw III"" a better sequel than ""Saw II"" was.<br/><br/>But besides being a sequel to the first movie, the movie of course also still is a sequel to ""Saw II"", featuring some of the characters- and concentrating on some of the events of the second sequel in the Saw movie franchise. Nevertheless games are being played with some new characters again. It's also basically one of the reasons why so many Saw got and still can get made. New characters can constantly get introduced into the franchise and the concept alone is more than enough to provide a never ending supply of Saw movies. Part five and six all already in production and it seems like one new Saw movies get released every year.<br/><br/>To be perfectly frank, I thought that the story of this movie got brilliantly written. Of course everything comes together again at the end, in a great way. Calling ""Saw III"" predictable, just because it's the third movie in the franchise and uses the same concept is just not fair. The story is in no way predictable and its filled with some unexpected twists. It's a very well thought out script that again of course also futures some complicated life and death puzzles which the characters have to solve in a certain amount of time in order to survive.<br/><br/>It's also a movie more about emotions and some classical themes, rather than just simply being a well written gory horror flick, like perhaps the two first movies were. The movie focuses more on the Jigsaw character than ever before as well. The story cuts back and forth between the Jigsaw plot line and that of the character of Jeff, who is in the middle of playing Jigsaw's latest cruel game.<br/><br/>It's made in the same style as the other Saw movies, meaning that it's fast and has a typical unpleasant dark atmosphere. It's from the same director of ""Saw II"" and he also directed the fourth sequel in the series. It's also as gory- and features just as ingenious well thought out and shocking deathtraps as was the case with the previous movies. Although it also needs to be said that the Jigsaw's surgery sequence is perhaps more gory than anything else in the movie really.<br/><br/>I liked the movie better than I ever could had expected.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","Saw 3 (2006) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Jigsaw is on his death bed and kidnaps a nurse to help keep him alive. If he dies so does she. Also on hand is another man who must play Jigsaw's game. To say anything else would pretty much ruin several surprises that happen towards the end of the film. I'm not a fan of this series and while I found the first two film very well made, I think they crossed the line that no horror film should cross in the fact that they were mean spirited and sadistic. I was worried at the start of this film because we once again entered that sadistic violence but thankfully this ended after the first thirty minutes and when the ""game"" started we actually got a pretty good little thriller. The torture scenes are a lot tamer and take a back seat to the story, which is why I think this is the best of the series. The character of Jigsaw has always been an interesting one but we really didn't get to know anything about him in the first two movies. He's on full display here and it was interesting to see him interact with the people playing the game. I viewed the unrated DVD and I'm not sure how much is different from the R-rated theatrical cut but the brain operation scene is certainly well done."
"samuraifa451","9","0","1","1 December 2007"," Excellent film
","This was incredible from start to finish. Not only is this scarier than the past two films, but you'll be on the edge of your seat for the remainder of the film almost as soon as the films starts off. The traps are more intense, and Jigsaw starts to seem like James Wan of the original film had intended him to be. All the characters are tense and never keep the movie dry as it unravels more and more to what I consider to be one of the greatest horror movie endings ever developed. Come the end, you'll be amazed, appalled, and probably wanting to see it again because if you liked the last two, you're going to go crazy for Saw III. My only wise word of warning: if you're a little queasy, don't go see this movie. It's just that gory, it makes the past two films look like G-rated Disney films. But for everyone else who saw the past two films (That's another big thing, you cannot watch the Saw films out of order, they contain so many references to past films you're just going to be lost, so make sure you've seen the past two before you watch Saw III), I promise you're in for a frightfully-good time."

","SAW III (2006) <br/><br/>It's Halloween so it must be SAW... <br/><br/>The makers of the SAW series have figured out that their low budget films are making decent money at the box office, so why not make more and more and more? <br/><br/>New traps are set, more violence and gore are available to satisfy the expectations of the audience and surprisingly once more this is an entertaining film. <br/><br/>Don't expect espionage by CIA agents or a great courtroom drama nor an intellectually draining masterpiece; SAW III aims to purely entertain.

","SAW 3 is a sequel that probably would have been better left unfilmed. Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is back, an improbability based on his condition at the end of SAW 2, along with his loyal minion (Shawnee Smith), looking sexier than ever. While Smith is putting new victims through the wringer, Jigsaw is having brain surgery. This brain surgery, the high or low point of the film depending on your point of view, is done in loving closeup. The film is just gross, but not a good type of gross as in SAW 1, which leaned toward grossout comedy. Nope, this one is all business and quite serious. The ridiculous ending suggests another sequel would be impossible, but guess what just opened. SAW IV, anyone? Give it time, and this series will go to STV land."
"djavh","4","0","1","21 October 2007"," Exaggerated amount of intelligence
","The first Saw movie was interesting, because there was not a lot of movies, where some killer tortures his victims and you can see all bloody details of that process. Also, there was a try to made the movie that is deep and full of surprises. The Jigsaw was not only stupid maniac, that kills his victims with an axe or chainsaw. He tries to make a point, why one or another people gets adequate punishment or test. And this psychological contest were supposed to make the film enjoyable for all audiences.<br/><br/>Now, when everybody had seen Hostel, House of Wax and other similar stuff, the psychological side of this movie has to be very sharp, to make this film deeper than other bloody movies. This makes ""Saw 3"" probably the stupidest one from all Saws.<br/><br/>The Jigsaw continues his game even he is already one leg in the coffin. He is like from another world with his magical capability to see all steps, that his players will make. He even can to record his voice in dictaphones, while he lies with brain tumor and can hardly talk with people around him. His game with Amanda was very stupid because the same reason.<br/><br/>So, this excessive amount of Jigsaw's intelligence is the biggest problem in this movie. The role of Amanda in his final game are also very stupid, it does not make any sense at all, except that it is an unexpected ending of the movie. The final game for Jeff was not a surprise for me. There are a lot of stupidity in other places of this movie, but you can see it yourself. Oh, by the way, the editing are very annoying. These short shots of blood, instruments of torture and similar stuff sucks more than in other parts of Saw.<br/><br/>Well, I liked that in this movie you can see the preparing process for games from previous movies. The scene where Jigsaw puts on some make-up and then lies in the puddle of blood was good. Thas was a good flashback to first Saw. Other preparations for games was also good.<br/><br/>Well, if you have seen previous Saw movies, you will probably watch this one as well. It entertains, but exaggerated attempt to make this film very clever strikes in a logical side of it. It develops a lot of strange and idiotic events, that is the biggest problem of all intense movies.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>Sorry about my English"

After starting off in complete darkness and hearing constant profanity, which i really have nothing against, it just seemed to be completely unnecessary. Who needs to start a film with somebody screaming the F word 100 times?

Why do you need to show such graphic gore? Who wants to see it?

","When the first Saw came out it was a revelation. Although low budget, it brimmed full of suspenseful ideas and is a modern day horror classic. Tightly scripted, with just one main set, the claustrophobic horror overwhelmed the viewer. The second Saw lost momentum because of the multiple sets, this one just squeezes the juice out of an already overworked idea.<br/><br/>Sadly, the new vogue is torture-flicks as practised by Hostels 1 +2, No Way Out, Vacancy and now this. The bastard progeny of the first Saw.<br/><br/>The new scenario for the torture of hapless innocents is pretty unconvincing. once again the claustrophobia of the original is lost, and with it dramatic tension. As a consequence the gore is just that. No real context, you don't really care about the individuals or find their predicament convincing.Hence the only way to ratchet up the ""thrills"" is to devise ever more sick torture scenes.<br/><br/>The actors don't act, they just perform horror poses. It is desperately disappointing to see this franchise so bankrupt of inspiration. Because lurking in there, there is still another original film to be shot.

"Tubular_Bell","3","0","2","22 July 2007"," The art of giving people what they want
","The first two movies were more than enough to surface what people REALLY expect from the movie: violence, plenty of it, and not much more than it aside from good dosages of cruelty and ""morals"" - as in, yes, it's justifiable and COOL to kill people who don't appreciate life, and miss the perverse irony (though I'd call it stupidity) that the person who wants to teach others to appreciate life does little to appreciate life, himself. Of course, intelligence is not exactly in the movie's plans, as many fans of the second movie were unable to understand what ""over the rainbow"" stood for, so we have to keep it simple and dumb. And that's what you get here.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, this is the movie that pulls all stops in making the most mind-bendingly repetitive and inane sequences in the series, with a dozen edits per second and annoying background music, as well as bunches of flashbacks that don't really explain much, and are probably there to earn a few more minutes of running time. They really need it, because the plot can barely contribute with ANY entertainment value. The characters are rough caricatures trying to pass themselves off as real, tortured humans, and the story itself, well... the first two movies already displayed what kinds of tricks the writers are willing to pull off, and Saw 2 brings absolutely no surprises. You already expect the Super Plot Twist at the end, as well as the annoying ""dark ambient"" theme tune, and everything is there. At least, this time around, the unfolding of the events is a considerably more believable - keeping in mind that Saw looked like it had no respect for its viewers' intelligence, and Saw 2 was an open insult against reason. But when there isn't a ""trap"" scene going on, the pacing is awfully slow and constantly interrupted by senseless flashbacks (really, what IS the point of going back to the set up of the first movie? Just to counter the criticism of its contrived, impossible ending? Filling up the plot holes, are we...), leaving very little flow to the movie. It's a poorly hacked together horror piece of trash, but it improves somewhat on the second movie - which REALLY isn't saying much.<br/><br/>The torture scenes, though, are an unnecessary strain to sit through. Yes, they are very explicitly violent and gross, but if that's what you want, you're better off with George A. Romero. This stuff takes itself too seriously. It's ""violence for a REASON"", and yes, it's granted to convert many people to the Church of Jigsaw - if you doubt me, check out the forums at IMDb. But unless you're very, very curious, leave Saw 3 alone. Really."

","In this 3rd edition of Saw movies, most of the 'work' is done by Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda, as Jigsaw spends whole of the movie on the bed, counting last hours of his life.

That guy is Jeff who had lost his young son a few years ago and since then he has been looking for revenge. In his tests, he will come up against people who were, in one way or another, responsible for the death of his son and he will be the one to decide their fate, whether to let them die or to forgive and save them. Watch out for some unexpected twists at the climax. <br/><br/>There is lots of blood, gore and innovative traps. There is some amount of nudity as well. This may be because the filmmakers were not so sure about whether they will be able to draw audience to the theaters one more time. Some of the questions that had remained unanswered in the 1st and 2nd edition, (which most people, including myself, thought were the flaws in the script) have been answered in this edition in the form of flashbacks.<br/><br/>In the end, if you liked the two earlier editions, then you'll like this one too."

","After seeing Saw 3 I had to seriously ask myself one question: why do I continue to see these absolutely horrible movies? Everything about this movie is garbage; the torture is too much to take, the characters are as thin as tracing paper and the plot runs like water. IF this movie had anything remotely substantial as a storyline it might be more tolerable, but piling such horrid acting upon a plot thinner than skim milk makes the torture scenes worth as much as a torn dollar bill. This movie does nothing more than ruin the mood while churning the fluid in your stomach...someone needs to tell the producers to either hire better actors or somehow attempt to write a credible story. Every SAW movie ends the same exact way, in a ridiculous twist which, of course, leads to a sequel. If anyone keeps their wits about them, SAW 4 will be received in the same manner of the producers latest film: in DEAD SILENCE."

"Lament79","Null","0","1","10 March 2007"," I felt let down
","Have seen the the first 2 movies and enjoying them, I was awaiting the third instalment with a sense of excitement. I have no problem with crap films - I own Crocodile 1 & 2 - But this just stinks of a rush job.<br/><br/>For a start, why all the flash backs?! It slows the film down, to point where I started to lose interest. If you're a fan of the series, you will know whats happening - you don't need it spelt out every 10 minutes. Yes - every 10 minutes we get basically a bit of filler, and it just goes to show how thin the plot is.<br/><br/>Another problem is Shawnee Smith. Shes simply doesn't have the shoulders to carry this film. She was good in the first two because she had bit parts - her character is not strong enough to base a trilogy on - which is what ultimately happens.<br/><br/>And the lack of Jigsaw - he is reduced to an old man in a bed, dying. That's about as scary as cute kitten. You can see his point of view in the first 2 films, but in this is just comes across as bitter and a loser. Perhaps that's the point, I don't know. Anyhow, Jigsaw was wasted. Shame.<br/><br/>As for the twist, which, let's face it, is what we all want, was a major let down. Even I got it before the end, which is unheard of!! It feels as though the writers just stumbled into an ending - then didn't have any plan, or any idea how to tie up the lose ends. I felt very let down by the ending. It was weak and, frankly, unbelievable.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the gore was great. Perhaps the most brutal mainstream film I've seen. But it was gore for the sake of it. It wasn't needed, It was there to flesh out the running time - but I'm not complaining!! IMO, this was a weak ending to the series. A lack of decent script, no real scares and a crappy lead actress make this a rental only. I won't be adding this to my collection."

","The definition of suffering and macabre is explained going into detail and with irresistible flair. The torture, apparently torturing the victims for their own good, is this time much more perverse than in the first two movies, so no fan of the series will be disappointed. This ""instalment"" is probably the most impressive as for gore, violence and sequences of terrible tortures, that's why ""Saw III"" is a must-see film for those who love the gory versions of horror. A forth one would be too much, though there will be for sure, due to its ending. Anyway the third one is still gripping and interesting, the best of the trilogy started in 2004"
"Surecure","6","0","2","19 February 2007"," Not as good as the first; more on par with the second
","The Saw franchise is one of those guilty pleasures that you don't necessarily have to keep secret. The first film was a refreshing horror film with an innovative script and enough chills to keep you wanting more. The second was more a by-the-book suspense film with more gore than frights.<br/><br/>Saw III sits in the same arena as the second film in that it bases its shock value on gore, not suspense. There are very few moments that actually jump out and scare you (actually, I can't remember even one) which is unfortunate since that is what true horror films need. As well, the cinematography is so dark for most of the film that it is difficult to know exactly what is being shown.<br/><br/>However, the audience is treated to more of the innovative torture devices and twist endings that made the first film work. I ended up figuring the ultimate twist of the story well before it was presented, but it was still a worthy payoff. And the slight open-end to the film is a little but of a cruel way of leaving things hanging, though in a good way.<br/><br/>All in all, like the second film, Saw III is a fun little gore fest that's not incredibly unique. In that, it certainly won't stand out as one of the better horror films of all times, but it will certainly entertain for an evening. And sometimes that's all you need."

","Don't get me wrong, I really liked the third installment of Saw, but I am just wondering how they can make another? They killed off both of the main characters and left only a weirdo guy stuck in a room of dead people. Sure Donnie Wahlberg's character is most likely still alive, but do you really think they would have him become the next jigsaw? I think they just need to stop were they did and leave it at that. A cliffhanging ending is always good when left alone. Even though I might check out a psycho officer trying to follow in a genius crazy man's footsteps. I just don't think it would make for a good movie. And one more thing, how is it that jigsaw died so fast. I mean didn't he only have colon cancer when he first found out? How did it spread to his brain that fast?"

","Yes, they have done it again, but this time it has become much more of a terrifying ride than a curious one. Using of course the best of graphics when it comes to blood and gore, they didn't cheap us short for anything less than a thriller. There are so many things in this movie that made me want to hate the entire series, but there is always that slight bit of being pushed off the edge that ties me back into being a completely obsessed fan. I think this movie is different from anything I have ever seen in a SAW film, and I'm extremely ecstatic for that. In this movie, I was so happy to see Amanda's true side for once. I don't think the movie before gave her any credit for being so different than any of us has pictured before. You probably could not even imagine the clarity and enjoyment of this film unless you have seen it and fell in love with it much like I did. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has not only watched a SAW movie previously and loved it, but if you hated it as well.

"sinwagon82","6","0","1","5 February 2007"," Saw III: No Plot But Plenty Of Gore
","I am not a fan of scary movies. I know it is not real yet I cannot avoid my unforgiving vivid imagination. So obviously I surprised myself when Saw I became one of my favorite movies. Then, I saw it only fitting to see Saw II, which was not bad but it was no Saw I.<br/><br/>Saw III, to me, seems miles away from Saw I's captivating storyline and appropriate violence. Saw III was gratuitous with its torture scenes and inhumane treatment; it is, by far, the goriest movie in the trilogy. There are no new and surprising turns in Saw III. It is simply 108 minutes of superfluous violence and torture. It never stops. There is hardly a moment to rest in between each bloody sequence.<br/><br/>If you like seeing blood gush, flesh rip and bones break then here is your new favorite flick. If you are not a fan of torture films, RUN! If you are at all squeamish, then this is not the movie for you. I watched this movie with my current boyfriend, who had never before even winced during the other horror films we have watched (Texas Chainsaw: The Beginning, Silent Hill, The Omen). However, the Saw III scene that involves an up close and personal brain surgery (drilling open the skull and all) had him squirming.<br/><br/>Five minutes into this movie I was already drained. I will admit to having spent the majority of the 108 minutes hiding behind a blanket, shielding myself from Jigsaw's cruel, cruel mind. The final scene is less than brilliant but leaves everyone wondering: will there be a Saw IV? <br/><br/>You cannot say you have not been warned."
"Robert_duder","9","0","1","5 February 2007"," Saw...rolling out the greatest horror series of the modern era
","I honestly didn't think the Saw series would be able to hold ground past the first sequel. As amazing and terrific as Saw II was, even better than the original, I could see the inevitable prat-falls that would cause the downward spiral of this series. Imagine my shock when they took Saw III and made it even more spectacular, fixed all those plot holes and made the series even more intelligent, more gory, more creepy and gritty and riveting and made us all wet our appetites for more. That makes the Saw series an absolute phenomenon among horror films and horror series. Saw III left behind the premise of a group of people being tortured by the deranged madman Jigsaw and brought back the terror of one person being alone in his game to escape. Each victim is brought together for a reason and a purpose and Jigsaw's heir and student which I thought was a poor addition to the second installment was downright brilliant in the third. The story gets more complex with each turn and it has an intelligent, well based and terrifying plot.<br/><br/>Tobin Bell is absolutely brilliant. He is now considered the man who has brought forth one of the most terrifying and brilliantly horrific horror movie monsters of the modern day...Jigsaw or John Kramer as he's known. Bell has been a long time character actor, been on TV for years and years and usually does play the bad guy because he's just got the ominous flavor to his performance but Jigsaw is so versatile. I mean Jigsaw is more than just depraved and completely sick, he's brilliant, a genius even, he believes he has justification for her murders stating constantly how he 'hates murderers.' His soft spoken tone, quiet eyes and disturbing voice makes him absolutely phenomenal for this role. I admit I wasn't a fan of the addition of a Jigsaw sidekick in Saw II but actress Shawnee Smith certainly changed my mind in this third installment. Now granted I think the screen writer did something far more phenomenal with her character making her a victim to Jigsaw as much as anyone despite being his heir apparent. Smith shows a versatility and as deranged as she is there is some pathos felt for her character this time around. She comes across as more of the villain than Jigsaw. We get a far more in depth look into her character arc and how she got to this point with John in flashbacks and moments between each film up until now. Angus Macfadyen plays Jigsaw's latest victim and he will run him through a barrage of tests to teach him forgiveness, each test terrifying and disturbing in it's own right. Macfadyen is brilliant as the tortured father who lost his son in a car accident and now faces the opportunity to exact revenge on those he feels are responsible. Macfadyen makes for a great male lead taking over from Cary Elwes and Donnie Wahlberg. Bahar Soomekh plays Lynn, the brilliant surgeon who is kidnapped by Jigsaw in order to keep him alive long enough to play one last game. Soomekh is very good and a strong female lead and shows an equal amount of strength and sincerity as well as appropriate fear and weakness. Also returning in smaller roles this time around is Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyer, the detectives who have tracked Jigsaw since the original and it's sequel.<br/><br/>What else can be said?? Saw III is downright brilliant. You can't watch it on it's own right to see it's true brilliance but rather part of one of the greatest horror trilogy's ever made. They are laying down a foundation for what could be an incredible series. Director Darren Lynn Bousman took the helm again after doing the second one and since the two sequels exceeded the original and they seem to be discovering better ways to do things with each one I hope Bousman continues to direct. What more can they do with the series?? I say this after every Saw installment but I can only hope that they manage to continue down the brilliant path they are on. Perhaps we will start to see an unraveling of Jigsaw's history...we saw tiny moments of it in this film but more could be done. So far they have done an incredible job of continuity and bringing everything together. Is Jigsaw gone?? I hope not...I think he's too smart for that. Lord knows I wanna play another game. Incredible film!! 9/10"
"ejderkelebek","8","0","1","3 February 2007"," Ethical Dilemmas
","The main, difference point of saw from any other thriller is the ethical dilemmas that victims (discussable) are put and also the cunning setups. The setups are so cunning that, the ethical dilemma, to give life, to take life, also put the audience into a position what would I do if I were there? The Saw series in that sense have already been a classic on its own. Can go IV or V ? <br/><br/>This saw is different than the others in that sense. Who is the victim, what can you sacrifice in favor of your work is answered. It leaves you into a wander that, the stunning and cunning scenario leaves you just there. There really remains the sense that What will be in the next? Much more than any other saw. I must warn you that it is more bloody than any other saw as well.<br/><br/>The ethical dilemmas of saw, making you silent in the sense that, if we were the judge and the rule that people always face. Eye to eye. The missing part of saw is the repetition of our main character.What is missing is the details of the philosophy... <br/><br/>As a philosopher I can easily say that the main philosophy is worth considering but the deals are visualized, these are all OK. But the ethical dilemma's can be detailed as Philosophy... It could be great..<br/><br/>Overall if you watch the two please do not miss this 3rd part. If not the others do not watch it..

","I rate the original Saw as an 8, Saw II as a 7 and this one as a 6. Held my interest but I doubt I'd ever watch it again. I think it is the best acted of the three - Robert the Bruce is definitely a step up. But it lacked the cleverness of the first two - the twists are minor and easy to see coming. Also, it promises much more than it delivers: ""Suffering? You haven't seen anything yet."" The first Saw had acting problems and a few too many jump cuts - other than that it was solid. The second Saw had better acting but the script was somewhat implausible - I mean Jigsaw's plan relied on everyone doing exactly as he planned. But the final twist was brilliant. This one has far too many implausibilities. You live with Jigsaw the master game player and never suspect he may be playing you? You come across people in deadly peril and you stop to lecture them on how they didn't help when your son was killed? I think I would save them first then administer the lecture. Also it was unclear whether he was allowed to continue regardless of whether he passed the test or not. He didn't seem to pass all of them. The most annoying part was near the end when they started playing back stuff that happened in prior movies so you could understand the ""master"" plan. But then they started showing scenes that had just happened three minutes ago. We really didn't need those flashbacks, thank you. And the whole movie is a setup for a sequel (presumably the last possible film in the sequence unless they do prequels as well). Another poster commented that Jigsaw's early traps were unfair - I believe this is explained near the end of the movie. But the victims in this one do seem a lot more ""innocent"" than in the first two films."

","Lately Dr. Lynn Denoln (Bahar Soomekh) has been going through some marital problems and the anxiety is beginning to affect her work. Late one night after finishing her shift at the hospital she is kidnapped and taken to an abandoned warehouse. Shortly after waking up, she soon meets the notorious Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). He is currently dying slowly as the minutes pass and Amanda (Shawnne Smith), Jigsaw's sidekick, tells Lynn she has been kidnapped in order to keep him alive. Alive long enough for someone else that's also been kidnapped named Jeff (Angus MacFadyen), to complete his very own game. While telling Lynn this, Amanda places a collar around Lynn's neck that is connected to Jigsaw's heart rate. If his heart rate drops below zero before Jeff completes his game, the shotgun shells on the collar will all simultaneously go off at the same time. Amanda then preps Lynn as Jigsaw explains, ""it's a test of will. It's a test to see just how willing you are to keep someone alive"". Lynn realizes she has no choice, and so the game begins. Jeff must now navigate through a series of tasks where he is promised his chance to get revenge on the man responsible for his son's death. Something he has wanted every day for the last three years. Both Lynn and Jeff are now each tangled in a horrid game of survival. What they don't know is their games are merely stepping stones to the true reason they are involved with Jigsaw's latest puzzle.<br/><br/>First off, I have to admit I was a little turned off to 'Saw III' earlier this week after months of having much anticipation, when I heard it was guaranteed that there would be a 'Saw 4' if 'III' did well opening weekend. I feared then, and still do slightly, that the 'Saw' franchise will become what 'Friday the 13th' did: a series of films where only the first few were considered good. Once I was sitting in my seat at the theater though, and the film began I was vastly interested far more than I imagined I would be. This 'Saw' has so much story in it than the previous two had, and really more than most horror films today do. Much of it is told generally with various flashbacks. Even by following the story closely, the final twist probably won't be known to you until its unveiling. It's in the twist that a tiny smidgen of a problem exists.<br/><br/>It's obvious that the twist was meant to shock the audience in a big way. Maybe it does catch most people by surprise, but for me didn't. Not that it isn't good, it just didn't come across the way it should have. It gave me a, oh...okay feeling rather than a, holy sh*t reaction. This minor flaw doesn't hinder the film's poise at all though. It still remains interesting to the very last minute.<br/><br/>The only real letdown in the film are some of the traps. In all there is a total of six physical ones. These devices of torture and terror are what many of people who love the 'Saw' series look forward to most. Out of the six, only two were what I'd say good. Yes, all of them can kill, but four of them seemed boring and livid. I'm not sure what happened here. Although, this doesn't destroy the movie, in a small way it does take away from it. Even so, the two good traps almost make up for the others.<br/><br/>So basically, 'Saw III' is somewhat better than I expected. It borders very closely to the feel of the first, which is a definite plus. Most satisfying though is that it wasn't the least bit dismal. Never was there a dull moment, even with the few shoddy traps. Now that 'Saw III' is done and over with though, it only makes me question what '4' have in store for us. Yes, Tobin Bell was contracted for five films permitting each is considered a success, but now that director Bousman and writer Whannell have decided to step aside and leave the series alone, I can only wonder two things. Will 'Saw' become a victim of its own game? Just how long can the series go on before it suffers the fate Jason Voorhees did?"
"soman","5","0","2","31 January 2007"," A Five Star Horror
","I fell in love with the series much like many of the horror buffs that have latched on to these movies. Not particularly interested in spending $9.00 to see the movie once, I just bought it on DVD yesterday and sat in my room for a good watch. I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The traps are extremely elaborate, which the DVD does a good job of showing in the extra features. A junkie that cuts herself, to me anyway, doesn't have the mental capacity to design such a tremendously complex device as ""the rack"" or even the ""angel trap.""<br/><br/>Jeff's character is completely uninteresting. If they had shown more than just snapshot flashbacks about why he is being tested, it might have given the audience more compassion and empathy for his character. As it is, he just seems like a madman that should really care less about what happens to the victims of the traps.<br/><br/>The relationship between Amanda and Jigsaw is at best disturbing. You'd think that Amanda was Jigsaw's love toy by the way she gets ""angered"" at his connection with Lynn. She seems more like a disgruntled wife than a student of his intelligent mind.<br/><br/>Having really enjoyed the first two, the third was a huge letdown. The ending was predictable, and I hope for the sake of the directors and Leigh Whannell that Saw IV can capture the pieces that were missing in this film."

The whole thing seemed kind of pointless to me, as if they crew were just trying to fit as much violence and gore into it as they could.<br/><br/>To me the progression of the storyline in the movie seemed very choppy as well, with a lot of flashbacks and side scenes such that it made it hard to concentrate on the storyline. I also felt that there were too many unanswered questions remaining for the movie to appear to be the final part of the series.<br/><br/>All in all, if you've seen the other two and enjoyed watching the movie for the plot twists and the dramatic irony in the big reveals at the ends, this movie does not equal its predecessors. If you just want to watch a movie for the violent content, this movie is a great way to waste the time."

Also the victims aren't in a whole lot of pain while they try to get out of the trap in the previous films but these victims are in excruciating pain which we find out why towards the end. This movie was very clever also like the first 2. I really feel for Shawnee Smiths character in this movie. Before she never had a huge speaking role in the movies but in this one she becomes angry and raged and bossy as well. I love her sarcasm too. And when you watch this movie and find out things you realize how weird and crazy it is that she has been involved in this whole thing longer then anyone expected. This movie was very emotional too. Definitely touches a nerve or two. I loved this movie and all the other ones. I don't know if a Saw 4 is in the making or not but Im interested in finding out what it will be like. Also if you need more info and are confused about this movie listen to the commentary done by the director and Leigh whannell it definitely clears things up."

","WHAT AN AMAZING HALLOWEEN PARTY MOVIE!!!!! Okay people, let me start by saying that I watched Saw 1 and fell in love. When I rushed to the theatres, eagerly awaiting the 2nd Installment, I was severely disappointed. It seemed like Saw 2 was just a big money grab. <br/><br/>HOWEVER! - +<br/><br/>My brother had recently picked up Saw 3, so I decided to pop it in and kill 2 hours. What harm could be done?<br/><br/>The result: This movie satisfied, in many ways. <br/><br/>Most people who didn't like it were either upset with the concept of the plot, haven't seen the previous Saw films, or were too focused on the depth of realism within the movie.<br/><br/>Yeah, It's not the world's most realistic movie- it's got plenty of flaws, but for what it was, this movie is absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, this movie is not for everyone, hence the bad reviews, but if you're looking for a good time and you've seen both prequels, I would HIGHLY recommend this movie to any Saw fans."
"EVOL666","7","0","1","30 January 2007"," Suitably Gory - Weak Storyline...
","This third entry in the SAW series amps up the gore over the other two entries, and dumbs down the plot a bit. Seems like this series is having a bit of an internal conflict with itself, as it can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a thriller, or a balls-out gore-fest. I like the way that the deaths are getting more graphic, but it's definitely at the expense of a solid storyline.<br/><br/>This one has ""Jigsaw"" on his death-bed, and he and his apprentice kidnap a surgeon to sustain Jigsaw's life until his final guinea-pig either succeeds or fails in his trap-challenge. The ""competitor"" is a father whose son was killed by a driver who got off after only six months of jail-time, and Jigsaw's ""game"" is to promise vengeance for the father - if he makes it through a series of obstacles...<br/><br/>SAW III started off great - two rough scenes in the first 15 minutes or so, then it starts to slow down a bit. The story about Jeff (the father), while providing some decent gore-gags, didn't do much for me story-wise. I honestly felt no kind of connection to him, his plight, and really didn't care whether he lived or died. I think if it weren't for the elaborate death set-ups, I probably wouldn't have cared for this one at all. Luckily, the kills and traps are inventive enough to be entertaining, and there are some tense moments as you wait to find out the fate of each person who comes into the picture. The ending was a bit uninspired and I found it a bit confusing and implausible. Of the three - I enjoyed this the original the least (two slow, not enough pay-off), the second the best (good mix of decent storyline and cool traps), and this third one is in the middle. I really dug the gore, but the story-line just didn't work for me. Either way, I'd recommend it for gore fans, or fans of the series. The uncut version of SAW III shows that there may be hope for gory, Hollywood-made horror afterall...7.5/10"

It is what it is: A horror film. The special effects are top notch and the Direction is incredible. I loved it! The acting is fine and the story line. although predictable, is entertaining. It did leave the ending open for Saw part 4 but I hope if they do it they can keep the energy and creativeness that this one had. It's not really a scary film but more of just a gory blood-fest that I found entertaining. If you saw part 2 and were somewhat disappointed as I was... check out part 3.

The second was much better, but still to be improved. So I decided to go for the third, hoping nothing more than a popcorn movie. It was more than that. <br/><br/>The third... was great. And not only great as a Saw or horror movie. It was clever, twisted and you really wonder what the end is gonna be like. In the 80's-90's, there was Freddy Kruger, now, there is Jingsaw. But contrary to Freddy Kruger, The Saw franchise has the potential to be remembered as a A movie category, because the third is not only good by himself but also justifies and complete the puzzles of the previous ones. I am actually surprised to see that Saw III has a lower rating than Saw II. Go for It, myself, i can't surprisingly wait to see the fourth!!"

","Saw 3 builds on the foundations of the two previous installments of the series, and to that it should take credit. <br/><br/>It follows almost flawlessly from the story of the previous movie, seamlessly integrating the unique themes, storyline and motives. Writers Leigh Whannell and James Wan, who co-wrote the first two installments, create a fresh new atmosphere, heavily influenced with the token horror mystery thriller genre that leaves audiences suspended on the edge of their seats. <br/><br/>Although not for the faint-hearted, and admittedly a little disturbing, the visual effects provide an appealing complement to the plot."

This movie was so bloody and so gory that I loved every minute of it. The plot is mediocre at best but it really develops a lot better than the plot in the first and second saw. The actors in this movie were pretty good and Tobin Bell does a great job playing Jigsaw in this movie. This movie isn't that scary but expect lots of blood and gore, especially if you get the unrated DVD version of it. Overall, its definitely worth renting and possibly buying if you love gory movies. Saw 3 is definitely the best of the three."

","Jigsaw John(Tobin Bell)and his protégé Amanda(Shawnee Smith)are up to their old tricks, but in this third film(and my favorite of the series)there are some surprises I didn't see coming. On ""trial"" is Jeff(Angus Macfadyen, who is blessed with a face and talent that can express all sorts of emotion), an emotionally unstable man, full of booze, wrath & pain, consumingly overwhelmed by the loss of his son in a car crash. The driver responsible was released shortly after thanks to a hasty trial with pretty much a slap on the wrist that might change a many of us who might have this same type of bitterness and rage if it happened to us(or, at least I put myself in his shoes). The other important character in Jigsaw and Amanda's new game is a female doctor named Lynn(Bahar Soomekh, another really great choice for the film..this film is a success in my eyes because the casting excels)who might be able to prolong his life among other things.<br/><br/>Jeff must complete a series of games in less than two hours or face being shut inside the building. Each game consists of those certain people who played intricate roles in or around his son's demise(the woman who, instead of assisting Jeff as he held his dying son, drove off;the judge who gave the murderer a slap on the wrist;the killer himself). Jeff has their lives in his hands. He can forgive or let them perish in Jigsaw and Amanda's crafted killing apparatuses. Meanwhile, Lynn has a metal collar, with chambered bullets, that is linked to Jigsaw's heart-rate. Her duty is to not let him die or else the bullets will fire right into her face. Also important is Amanda's role(what she does know and doesn't know..Jigsaw has prepared this whole game for a major purpose to be determined)in the grand scheme of things. She will determine the outcome just as much as Jeff..and not even know it! The film does lots of things this go-around, delving into how Amanda formed her partnership with Jigsaw, the loose ends untied from the second film regarding Eric(Donnie Wahlberg)will be finalized, and we actually see how Jigsaw prepared the test of the two male characters in the first film. These ""flashbacks"" regarding Amanda are crucial to the development of the film and it's climax. Like the previous two films, this one works off of some coincidences provided by a screenplay that needs certain characters to die(or suffer)at the right moment before they can be saved, or a certain character saved who just happens to be in a specific place to be shot by a shotgun. I'm not convinced anyone could put together such elaborately designed games without something going awry, but this like the other two is orchestrated by a screenplay writer with devious intentions for his created characters. We see that Amanda has created games that give those tested no way to survive which is not Jigsaw's method. This film is also the most grisly and gruesome of the three showing one unfortunate victim(caught in Jigsaw's favorite contraption, ""The Twister"") having his arms, legs, and head completely twisted around as bones snap out of the skin like broken wood. The ultimate goal of Jigsaw is choices and forgiveness. Can Jeff make the right choice and forgive those who have caused him so much agony? There are many who might be able to pick this apart with a fined tooth comb, but I just enjoyed it despite acknowledging that no one is that skillful enough to get away with what the film's death-geniuses do."

"hurtstotalktoyou","6","0","1","27 November 2006"," The pros and cons of formula film-making
","Probably the most obvious thing a viewer will notice about SAW III is that it follows the formula of the first two films. That's not always bad, of course: It worked for Last Crusade and Die Hard With A Vengeance, for instance. Unfortunately, the third film of a trilogy can often end up noticeably inferior to its predecessors. This is far more common, apparent in films such as Jurassic Park III, Final Destination 3, T-III and many others. Sadly, Saw III falls into this last category.<br/><br/>Don't despair, however; for there are benefits to a formula, too, namely that you can count on a movie providing an entertaining if not spectacular experience--assuming you enjoyed the first two, of course. And that's where Saw III works. If you want gory traps, daring escapes and a mysterious master plan that's not revealed until the very end, then Saw III will deliver! Also keep in mind it's not completely formulaic. The relationship between Amanda and John has been developing for some time now, and continues to do so in this new film, which adds a different dynamic. The point of view is increasingly focused on John, which also gives a unique flavor to this sequel.<br/><br/>The problem, though, preventing me from giving a completely positive review, is twofold: Firstly, the character development of the new faces is very lacking; secondly, for a formula based on plot twists, this film is a little too predictable. Given the pros and cons of the final product, I'd give it a six out of ten. In my rating scheme, that basically means it's worth watching, but I'd wait till it's out of the theater."

Anyway, Saw III IS better than Saw II & almost as good as part 1. In this particular installment the director & the writers both prove they are some really twisted bastards as they go on a grisly torture & death rampage. There is one scene in particular involving dead pigs that's sure to turn stomachs & another giving the viewer an updated version of the medieval torture device The Rack. In fact, that's all this film really is, is gore & torture. Oh sure there is the obligatory end of the film plot twists but outside of that, the film remains like its' predecessors un-scary, grisly, & of course shocking. Jigsaw is now on his deathbed, protégé near his side with a kidnapped female doctor who is given really no choice but to help prolong Jigsaw's life or literally die trying. Now for the customary Saw snafu's: 1) How does a dying bed-ridden man with rookie in tow find the time to discover these human ""lab rats""? 2) How does"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" find the time or strength to concoct these elaborate death traps? 3) Why are all these potential victims so damn stupid?

Cops trace it, find the hideout & end the game. <br/><br/>*MILD SPOILER* <br/><br/>I can't see any way that the producers can make a Saw IV especially one with Jigsaw. I say end it now, on a realitively high note. <br/><br/>Bloodstone's Recommendation: Saw III is decent movie going fare & worth wasting a couple hours & bucks on.

","Anyone who's familiar with the SAW franchise will know what the other two are about, and so I'm not going to bother giving a synopsis of the first two. Part three of the franchise reunites us with a now bed ridden Jigsaw and a borderline psychotic Amanda.<br/><br/>In Jigsaw's newest game, a doctor is kidnapped and forced to keep him alive and play his twisted game as a man named Jeff trails through the path of those responsible for the murder of his son.<br/><br/>The film is entertaining, gory and more of a thriller. This particular installment is very emotional, intense and loaded with plot twists. Unfortunately, those plot twists happen all at the same time and so the audience gets hit with what feels like a ton of bricks.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away very many spoilers, but the film has too many flaws in it. For starters, most of the traps seem too complicated to be set up by one person alone. It's not believable that Amanda could have set up these traps all by herself.<br/><br/>Second, why is Jigsaw now bedridden? He was fine in the first two films (notwithstanding his cancer), but in this film, he's on his deathbed. And anyone as ill as Jigsaw is wouldn't spend their last few moments planning a way to torture people and ""play games"".<br/><br/>Another problem is the character of Amanda herself. In part two, we learn that she's the apprentice (and damn good too!), but in this one, we learn that she sucks and deserves to die. The transition from respecting Amanda in the second film to ""die Amanda die"" in the third is rushed (we would expect that such a transition wouldn't occur until after a few later films).<br/><br/>We hadn't even begun to see her develop into this role of being the apprentice and she's already killed off. Too fast, too soon. And throughout the film, poor Amanda is confused; she kills hardcore, but as she does it, she weeps. Her weeping is in contrast to the other times where she takes pleasure in threatening to kill others.<br/><br/>One of the most recognizable quotes from the film is, ""Suffering...you haven't seen anything yet."" Shortly after the bed ridden Jigsaw delivers these lines, his throat gets cut. What horrible injustice to Jigsaws words - he lied! <br/><br/>The film has more problems than not, but for the sake of time and not nitpicking, I'll just say that with SAW IV, the crew should take a little more time to re-examine their choices, be a little creative, take risks and produce something new. Maybe even divulge into that back story with Jigsaw in love with that sexy beauty he was dreaming about. The script of part III was too similar in form to the previous two installments.<br/><br/>To conclude, was the film good? Yes. Great? Not really. The best film out there currently? No. The most fulfilling of the trilogy? I don't think so, but still worthy of a high rating. 7/10"

To the good side and the only one in this movies was the plot that was a lot better set out than saw II but overall some good crap fake effects and gore and loss of common sense but go to see it you might just like it."

","There were several things I enjoyed about the previous Saw films that were all but abandoned in this installment: One: As someone mentioned earlier, in Saw III people can no longer save themselves. Jigsaw says he is still trying to teach the same lessons, yet people cannot choose to live or die anymore; they are subject to other people's choices. This, in itself, seems to contradict the purpose of 'the game'. Second: Overkill, overkill, overkill. Overkill on the violence; overkill on the acting (I'm sorry, but Amanda just whined nonstop), and overkill on the final montage. Really, the ending wasn't that clever; there's no need to spend three minutes flashing it all back for us, up to literally seconds before the montage began. Plus, besides the fact that people could not leave the traps without assistance, the traps themselves were overkill. Where the hell did they find an unattended slaughterhouse with about 100 dead, rotting pigs waiting to be shredded? Finally: When I exited the theater, I was thinking of the little girl, and why it bothered me that he took her. Then it kind of hit me: Even when the detective's son was abducted, he had a criminal record; he was not innocent. I believe this is the first truly innocent person Jigsaw took, and once again, she has no way to free herself; she was left subjected to whether or not her father could save her. All in all, the man who played Jigsaw did some very good acting, but the script did not allow for the Jigsaw character to truly act his part."

","Jigsaw and Amanda kidnap a doctor to keep Jigsaw alive while a man who lost his son to a drunk driver must survive a handful of tests.<br/><br/>This film was not the greatest horror film I've seen. It certainly didn't leave me the way ""Saw"" left me. But as the third film in the series, hastily written, it was actually pretty good. The traps were decent (though less creative than before) and the story takes an interesting new direction. Best of all, flashbacks that help fill in the gaps from the first two films (many of us figured out how Jigsaw remained motionless so long in the first film, but now it's no longer a debate).<br/><br/>Some critics said the film had gadgets that were too high-tech or too reliant on medical knowledge. I disagree. They showed how devoted Amanda was and I find it plausible she spent countless hours perfecting the devices and studying anatomy (one scene makes it clear she has a solid knowledge of pharmaceuticals).<br/><br/>Others have said the film was gory. I say it was not gory enough! For me, the most disturbing scene was in the first five minutes. Later scenes that could have been incredibly bloody (a woman's rib cage being pulled forcibly open, for example) took the camera off the action or made the scene too dark to really enjoy. The generation of horror fans today grew up with Mortal Kombat... they can handle body parts getting ripped off. Give them what they want. (Not to mention the growing influence of Asian horror film gross-outs like ""Imprint"".)<br/><br/>The pigs in the grinder... delightfully perfect.<br/><br/>I also thought the plot was incredibly contingent. For it to work out perfectly, everything would have to happen exactly as it did with the right people living and dying and certain people being out of their homes long enough to rig things. (The Mysties are saying ""it's just a show, you should really just relax"" and they're right... but it saddens me to see such intelligent film makers leave these danglers.)<br/><br/>I'm not sure why the father of the drunk driver was targeted. Unlike past victims, his ""crime"" (wanting revenge on his son's killer) wasn't even really that bad. Very natural, in fact.<br/><br/>The visuals as usual are good, and the film is both dark and filmed through a blue tint to give a more sterile feel. Sterile as in isolated. <br/><br/>I feel there's so much more to say, but I'm drawing a blank. But really, if you liked the first two films you have no excuse to miss this one. It really clamps down the series."

","The original SAW was gruesome, but did occasionally leave things to the imagination. It had genuine tension, and a pretty intriguing mystery. SAW II was at least inventive and fun to watch. SAW III is easily the most gory, twisted, and nasty entry in the series, making it solid gold for the gore hounds out there. Unfortunately, the sense of mystery from the first two films is completely gone, you won't give a crap about the characters, and the pacing is clumsy. The film drags in many scenes, and just plain goes on for too long. If you're hard-core SAW/gore fan, you'll enjoy it, but there's only so much left the filmmakers can do with the premise. This is the kind of movie you're probably best off catching on sci-fi one night, rather than going to the theater.<br/><br/>And seriously, how many ridiculously elaborate set-ups could a serial killer (even an inventive one) come up with? How big is the size of this warehouse--a city? How many billions of dollars were spent on these schemes? Where did the money come from, and how did a highly-wanted serial killer come up with it? Just a few questions to ponder.."

","---------------------------------------------- Slight Spoilers ----------------------------------------------<br/><br/>For anyone who watched Saw 1, and was pulled into the story, but felt a lack of the real scare that comes out of horror movies, you now have saw 3 to watch. Saw 3 throws in a (in my opinion) GREAT story line about a man named Jeff whose son is killed in a car accident. Jeff and his wife are separated, and jiff dreams of the day he can come face to face with those involved. His wish comes true when Jigsaw puts him to the test; can he forgive and let them live? or forget and let them die? Meanwhile, a doctor is captured after her shift at the hospital, where she is greatly stressed. She wakes up and finds that she must keep Jigsaw alive as long as Jeff takes to complete his tasks. Jigsaw is close to death, and its a suspenseful battle against death throughout the movie.<br/><br/>SAW 3 also kicks you in the balls with violence, some times unnecessary, but definitely cool traps. There's 6 in all, and I thought 2 were kinda lame, but the 4 other ones, priceless. If i were to explain some of the gore scenes, it would ruin the movie, because some characters make their return, when they said they would not. Overall, do not see this movie if you are squeamish, but if you are a hardcore SAW fan, or mildly interested an have seen the FIRST TWO MOVIES, then go see this one too. Besides, if you don't like it, its only a movie.. right?"

","The plot is about people in traps made by Jigsaw and his assistant, Amanda, and they must get out of them to live. That's obvious but there are two victims. The first victim trapped under Jigsaw's game is the Dr. Lynn Denlon who must keep Jigsaw alive. If he dies, she dies. She must keep him alive as long as it takes this other victim, Jeff, to complete a game of his own, which is trying to find a way out of this house maze.<br/><br/>Apart from the very bad Saw II, Saw III was a very good film. It's not a great one, not better than Saw, but a lot better than Saw II. Now, there are a little bit of characters, which leaves room for character development, unlike Saw II which had many characters probably just for the kills. There's a lot more gore and it makes the first two films look like Disney films. And there's the extreme again, where the second left off and in which Saw had.<br/><br/>There are a lot of more traps in this film and they are very creative. This film also connects to the first two films very well so that's another good thing. In this film, we actually care for the villains (in my opinion). And in the end, you expected it, there's another twist. This is not the greatest twist of them all, probably the weakest but I didn't care. I didn't really get the ending because the ending feels a little bit rushed which was a problem.<br/><br/>Some other problems, called cliffhangers, or left for a sequel, are unexplained sub plots. Not all things were explained in Saw III, but we all know it'll be in Saw IV, which there will be one apparently next October? This film is suspenseful and some parts are thrilling and there are scenes that wants to make you throw up or cover your eyes.<br/><br/>This film is a great recovery from Saw II. It's not the best one in the trilogy but it's worth the $8 dollars in the theater or a buy on the DVD. This won't disappoint the Saw fans so go see it!"

SawIII had the gore but no death trap that make you think o my god. And it had an alright plot, but no twist I didn't see coming halfway through the movie.

When Jigsaw is in and out of consciousness, he has visions of a blonde woman...who is this? Is this his wife? When he is saying, I love you...I love you...and he is directing this at Lynn the doctor, is Amanda jealous? What was in the envelop that Jigsaw gave Amanda? I thought maybe it was his will? In the end, did Jigsaw or Amanda kill Det. Matthews. The info on this saw 3 say that the guy who played the judge was also in the 2nd one...where?

"irisstrings","6","0","2","31 October 2006"," Feed your screams.
","No Spoiler.<br/><br/>There was a time when Hitchcock shook the theatre with Janet Leigh's scream in Psycho (1960). People were unaware of the gore and gritty atmosphere of Hitchcok's creation. Perhaps this was the movie that created a new trend in the Horror/Thriller genre. Then it was The Exorcist (1973) when Linda Blair walked down the stairs on her hand and feet while lifting her body in a backward arch. This was the beginning of yet another trend. I believe then came SAW (2003) to create something you have never sen before. A serial killer with a gift of forgiveness only when his victims escape the traps he sets up. SAW has created a whole new meaning to Horror/Thriller. This movie fed to the new generations' needs of pure gore. SAW III stands to its expectations of blood, gore, cracking of bones, hacking of flesh, peeling of skin and crushing of skulls. I seriously do not believe how this movie escaped NC-17 rating. The last NC-17 movie I saw was Haute Tension by Alexandra Aja, another member of ""The Splat Pack"" along with Darre Lynn Bousman. The opening scene in this movie has similarity to one of the scenes from SAW I. But it has a ""little"" more outcome than it had in SAW I. With that little more I mean a sound effect and when it happened everybody in the auditorium went AWWWW. It was a ""Ladies and Gentlemen your attention please"".<br/><br/>The acting department? I would be highly insensitive to comment on acting. Nobody expects acting from SAW franchise. What I can do is perhaps compare with SAW I. There is a flaw in the direction. Darren may not make you glued to your seat. The traps are new but they are designed for something else other than just for the victims to try and escape. I would say Darren has managed to make those 1hr 40 minutes interesting enough for a thriller with a non-linear screenplay by Leigh Whannell and the gore content.<br/><br/>The twist is little unexpected. But it is something that only a few people would care for. At least SAW franchise has no ghost stories, UFOs or witches that create something supernatural. This is a movie that could come up with some explanations to stand for. Thats why I would choose this one over The Grudge or Silent Hill any day of the week.<br/><br/>So if you are having a bad day and want to go and scream your guts out then I suggest go watch this. This will feed your emotions."
"Paul-E","6","0","3","31 October 2006"," Good but not great final part of the Saw trilogy
","Picking up where Saw II left off this, the final part of the trilogy is both; the most disappointing and the most nihilistic, sadistic and gory of the three films. There are just far too many superfluous scenes. The first fifteen minutes of the movie could be cut out and it would have no impact whatsoever on the storyline of the movie and come across as gratuitous. That was one of the things I liked so much about Saw and Saw II, everything you saw whether it was exposition or scenes of carnage it all had a point in terms of the story as a whole whereas with this film there are some bits that make you think the writers came up with, admittedly superb scenes but then had no real way to work them into the plot and make them a part of it. Unfortunately as good, albeit gruesome as these scenes are they do feel rather tacked on and slow the film down. Indeed this is the slowest paced of the trilogy.<br/><br/>The acting quality varies in this film. Tobin Bell is fine as Jigsaw although he doesn't really have much to do. Shawnee Smith is superb as the unhinged Amanda and provides the films real energy. Angus Macfadyen's Jeff is full of rage but fairly one dimensional and is such an unlikable hero that to be honest you never really care for him at all. The weakest link in the acting stakes is Bahar Soomekh. I just never found her convincing and unlike Macfadyen whose character worked as a one note performance hers needed to be stronger, seeing as she was sharing some quite charged scenes with the two killers.<br/><br/>The games in this film are by far the most elaborate and I think the most sadistic. They are also by far the most graphic when they destroy the participant showing a very visceral disembowelment and with my personal favourite (and Jigsaw's too) turning a human beings limbs around 360 degrees in one of the most horrible scenes, think lots of snapping sounds and bones ripping through flesh and you get the idea (it was called The Rack). There is also some quite graphic DIY brain surgery which is quite nauseating.<br/><br/>So is the film any good? Yes it is. It does continue the story of Jigsaw and Amanda and brings it to a decent conclusion, still managing to pack in enough twists and turns and gore for fans of this sort of film. However given the high standard set by Saw and the surprisingly good sequel Saw II I was expecting more from this film and have to say that although good it didn't really enthral me as much as the first two films. It didn't really show me anything new, so from that point of view it was a very disappointing film. All in all this is very much the 'Return of the Jedi' of the Saw trilogy, it's good, it's entertaining and it ends the story nicely but you can't help thinking that it should and maybe could have been better."
"sullibrandon","6","0","2","30 October 2006"," Second one's the best, but this is still pretty good
","Warning: Don't read this review if you haven't seen the first two Saws.<br/><br/>With any movie that turns into a franchise, there is usually a distinct taste on the palette that the characters are getting a bit old. The story is becoming less novel and more traditional. Special effects take the place of solid story and tension. There are always exceptions that prove these rules, but Saw III is not one of them. In Tobin Bell's third outing playing the mastermind of Jigsaw, there is a distinctly stale taste in the air, a taste that works against the movie from the first frame to its last. Though Saw III does have plenty of good moments, it sacrifices story for gore, characters for gore, and good story for gore. Gore gore gore.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much of the story, but the basic plot is that Jigsaw and his new apprentice Amanda have kidnapped an expert in the field of brain surgery for the purpose of keeping Jigsaw alive as he plays one final game. The story intercuts between scenes with Jigsaw and this doctor, and a man named Jeff who must go through a series of puzzles/games as he tries to find the man who killed his daughter.<br/><br/>The film's biggest strength is the character of Amanda - whom we see briefly in the first one and more of in the second. In this outing, we see, through a series of flashbacks and how she is reacting to Jigsaw's imminent death, her character in much more depth. Obviously, it's nothing Oscar worthy, but it does add a little bit of spice to the franchise as a whole. We see scenes that extend all the way back to the first movie, which ends up working out pretty well.<br/><br/>Jeff, the guy who must find the man who has killed his daughter, is played by a less-than-stellar actor, but that's okay. He goes through all the motions of grief, pain, blah blah blah, but there's nothing really special there. Donnie Wahlberg, playing the cop who had his son kidnapped in the second film, was much better. Jeff's character is just basically a shallow revenge driven man. There are a couple of powerful moments in the film that emphasize mercy, forgiveness, and compassion, but these are eclipsed by the mountain of gore that is always sure to follow.<br/><br/>That is another of the film's weaknesses. All the gore. Of course, in a slasher flick, one wants a lot of gore - and if that is all you are looking for, it will not leave you disappointed. But the first two Saws managed to be creative in their gore, not giving us too much, giving us just enough, so that we were never overdosed. Though there is a fair amount of creative gore in the movie (the traps that Jigsaw and Amanda design are some of the most creative in the series), some of the gore just seems excessive. At one point Jigsaw must undergo brain surgery, and the film shows us every last bit of that. By the time the outer layer of skin had come off, I was going through the motions of being disgusted, but in all reality, it had worn off completely - the gore desensitizes in this film.<br/><br/>Jigsaw, who has always been the creative mastermind in the first two films, now lies completely incapacitated on a bed throughout the entire thing. He loses a lot of his fire, a lot of his mystery. The second one managed to show us Jigsaw in a vulnerable position, yet by doing that in the way they did he only seemed that much more twistedly clever. In this one he's just a body in a bed. Though the ending does redeem him a little bit, this is a character who has definitely seen better days.<br/><br/>The score of the film is fairly good. It has liberal doses of the original ending theme, ""Hello Zepp"" done in new and different ways. The rest of the music is traditional gore fest music, nothing too exceptional. The ending piece of music fell a little bit flat, too, it didn't really soar like the piece in the first or second one. And the fact that the ending fell flatter than the first two as well didn't work too well for me either. The tension in the film is lacking, too - because of the excessive gore, but also because of all the focus on Amanda - I did say that was one of the film's strengths, but a more effective balance would have helped the tension tremendously.<br/><br/>As much as I may be ragging on this movie, I did enjoy it. The new focus on Amanda was enjoyable, Jigsaw's creepy voice was once again, very well done, the gore was creative in many places and there were many more traps than the first two combined, and Angus Macfadyen, the man who plays Jeff, did a reasonably well job under the circumstances. The worst part about all this is that because it has shown to be so successful, earning 34 million over the weekend, beating the Halloween weekend record, Lionsgate has announced plans to make a Saw IV. Please, people. This may have been a good series, but the Saw franchise has definitely breathed its last. It was good while it lasted - one of the few slasher flicks that I actually respected and looked forward to. But towards the end of the film plot possibilities could definitely be seen to be wearing thin. Saw III was a good and enjoyable film, but Saw IV? No thanks. Ah well. I suppose I'll just sit back and enjoy this most recent installment while it still remains a reasonably satisfying conclusion to a great trilogy."

The plot twists more that you can count, the environment is one of the freakiest I've seen, and the gore is second to none. In fact is seems like the Saw 3 team focused all their attention on this gore factor, because honestly that is what draws ""Saw"" fans. Saw 3 makes hostel look like a Disney flick, showing the audience everything you're hoping not to see. However with all the hard work these guys put into the details and violence, they happened to make one of the slowest moving movies I have ever seen. When the lights in the theater came on I was certain that I had just watched a 3 1/2 hour movie. This is definitely NOT A DATE MOVIE! This is the movie you go to when you have nothing else to do. Because as I said earlier it moves slower that ""Return of the King"" on a good day. Serious Saw fans and Gore lovers will definitely get their yearly fix with this one.

We learn the true details about Amanda (Shawnee Smith in her best acting to date), the setup for the first 'Saw', and even a little lesson about what is Jigsaw's definition of a murderer, which he claims not to be.<br/><br/>Excellent acting throughout, with many plot twists and turns which will keep you interested in the current story while appreciating knowing how the other stories came about. Flashback scenes do not take away from the current story and do not interrupt the continuity of the film.<br/><br/>And oh yes, there is still even more blood. 'Saw' is truly shaping up to be the best TRUE horror movie franchise of our times. Jason, Michael Myers, and even Freddy can't touch this series. While Jason & Myers were basic creature won't die flicks, and even though the Freddy series took it to another level with style, humor, and interesting story lines, all three of those deal with the supernatural.

But I still expected a lot from it.<br/><br/>First of all the plot was pretty nice and interesting. The subplot onto this movie made it better and more thoughtful. The way it was directed was pretty interesting and well done. But I have to say the 'games/traps' were pretty lame. Like in comparison to the last two, these traps were bad, and I was really disappointed in them.<br/><br/>Saw movies, supposed to be filled with gore. The first one held its word, the second one, kind of, the third one, not at all. I was extremely disappointed in the amount of gore or blood was in this movie. There really wasn't that much, I don't see how it could have deserved the ""R"" rating where I live. There was a bit of blood but nothing that made me go 'wow this is awesome'.<br/><br/>Saw 1 and 2 started off quickly and kept me entertained. Did this one do that? No, not at all. I got extremely bored in this movie, there were large chunks that were boring, nothing happened. The only good parts were the beginning and the end.<br/><br/>In conclusion I was horribly disappointed in this movie, and if I go see it again I will only go to see the beginning and the end, which is the only reason why I gave this movie a 7."

","there's enough going on to keep you entertained. the biggest problem is that much of the story seems to be back-story for the 2 previous films. I would have been confused if I thought about previous victims or Shawnee Smith's involvement in the murders, but as I said, the strength of the film is how it keeps you interested in what's happening to the characters now. since we have a terminally ill Jigsaw, we get to see how he's dealing with his illness; we also have the tests given to the latest victim(s). and as with any good puzzler like these, we shouldn't be able to guess how all the victims are related until the final piece is revealed. and this is why this movie succeeds. we have four characters to follow through their ordeals, we get several mini tortures to enjoy, and we are filled in on details from the previous films. under any level of analysis, these stories are silly, this recent film had me wondering whether Jigsaw buys tape recorders in bulk as he uses about 7 in this movie. I'm not sure if the Saw franchise has anything left to tell us, but it's fairly obvious that Jigsaw will be back again since he's been given a mini-reprieve from his terminal illness."

","OK so on Friday (opening day) and Saturday i saw this movie. It was an awesome movie no doubt. It was packed with loads of gore, I am talking like more than Hostel. But the story was not as good as the other two Saw films. This one relied on making the movie good based on gore and violence instead of cleverness like the other two. Which is understandable because that is what teenagers these days like to see is gore. When the first film was made it was extremely low budget so they could do what they wanted with it. But once that got great ratings and the second one as well, i think they got a bit pressured to make this one extra gory just so the film would do extra well. My personal favorite thing about Saw was the twists that it provided. This ones twist was a bit weak but still clever. So don't get me wrong the movie still kicked, but it was not as clever and as well put together as the other ones. Still a must see."

","It's Halloween and it's time for another (and apparently) final Saw movie. The cast is in place (with the crafty Tobin Bell and the sexy psycho Shawnee Smith) and the game is beginning, but is this a good closure or another cursed part 3 in a long line of bad part 3's? Saw 3 throws us right in the mix, picking up right after the end of Saw 2. We get to see former New Kid Donnie Walburg and what really happened to him after the credits rolled (it's fun!!!). After this the movie goes on to its new story about a female doctor that has been having marital issues and seems to be a bit drained with her job and life as she has resorted to pill popping. What better a person than Jigsaw and Amanda to come in and help with that problem.<br/><br/>A proposition is made as Jigsaw is needed to be kept alive for one final game that will put every character in the movie in situations that will require them to make the right choice or the usual repercussion will follow. This leads to our other test subject that has had issues with releasing his anger and depression over his son being hit by a car. Leave it to Jigsaw to put all the possible ""pieces"" in place for the man to make choices for those involved to ""live or die"".<br/><br/>In the end both stories intertwine which leads into a double wam bam ending that should end the franchise in a good way. To say anymore would be spoiling it but also to add anymore movies to this trilogy would be an injustice. These movies should be remembered as being a solid example of 3 good movies and proof that if handled correctly you can make 3 solid movies, similar in nature yet each with its own characteristics that allow them to stand on there own.<br/><br/>Also this movie will shed light on the first 2 movies adding elements that allows us to see things from Jigsaw and Amanda's point of view. The only question for me still is what happened to Dr.Gordon? Anyway thats besides the point. In the end we get a good horror and gore film (oh yes there will be gruel!!!) with some sadistic torture and mayhem just in time for the Halloween weekend.<br/><br/>In closure I give Saw 3: 7/10: Good closure (hopefully) to the Saw Legacy. Fans of the first 2 will really get something out of this, new fans may want to watch the first 2 before entering in to the series. To do so will shed light on a lot of the foreshadowing that takes place in the film!! Lastly I leave you with a nice mathematical equation: Key+string+shotgun= DEATH....Im Out!!!<br/><br/>****UPDATE SAW 4 COMING**** I guess there goes the trilogy here some the quadrilogy...for now!!!"

The traps in this one are more gruesome then the first 2, well not exactly the traps, as some involve no blood at all, but when there is blood, it pours. The main premise in this movie is not as interesting as the first 2, and the twist is not as clever as the first 2, but you still have a movie that will keep you interested.

","Well, not being a huge fan of the first Saw, but enjoying it. Saw 2 showed up and sucked. I thought it was just a mess of a film, acting above all. Well thankfully Saw 3 has taken a step forward. Saw 3 is better than the first two. It doesn't have the mysterious charm of the first, but it's story is deeper and the deaths are bloodier, gorier and overall just better.<br/><br/>Story is about the bedridden Jigsaw needing help due to the tumor growing on his brain. His accomplice (the chick from the 2nd) is helping out, and she manages to get kidnap a doctor to help save Jigsaw....obviously a deadly game is involved. The story/game in this flick is on a much larger scale than the previous two films. There is also a couple throw in ""games"" and a side story (my favorite part of the film) which is thrown into the mix.<br/><br/>I kind of thought Saw 3 was a little long. They kept showing you what you were supposed to be thinking through short clips....I would say this is the most predictable Saw 3 yet, so these clips weren't really needed. But they are helpful. I also didn't like the accomplice to Jigsaw...she's a little too good at what she does, for being an amateur. I can complain about stuff till the cows come home, but I'd rather just say that this movie will most likely be a huge hit for Saw fans and Saw haters won't hate so much anymore....maybe not. It's not a bad movie...I wouldn't say it's a great movie. But it was pretty unique and gory. Pretty good flick. 7 outta 10"

","I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the film. But as most sequels prove-the original remains the best. I didn't find the end twist to be as exciting as the first two films. This installment does, however, win the award for the most gore. I have a pretty high tolerance to blood and guts, but I even found myself looking away at times. It didn't take away from my enjoyment of the film though. I would like to pose a question for my fellow Saw fans: For those of you who have seen it, do you think there will be more or does it end with Saw III? It would appear that both John and Amanda have met their demise, but who ever really knows? Especially since John reveals that he's hiding Jeff's daughter. It also looked like he was doing something with one of his audio tapes-pouring wax on it or something??? Did I see this correctly? Your thoughts?"
"missy173","6","0","1","28 October 2006"," Intelligent and interesting wrap up to Saw series.
","The first thing I have to say is that this final installment of the Saw series shouldn't be considered a horror flick. It's more like suspense+gore. I didn't scare once, and I didn't hear anyone else in the theater jump either. Although one girl did jump for a preview of Sarah Michelle Gellar's The Return. Saw III just didn't deliver with the thrills. But it did bring the gore in spades and if you enjoyed the previous installments you shouldn't walk away disappointed.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed the most is the writing. I feel like the writers really examined the previous two films and set out to wrap up all the loose ends that had been made with Saw II. Every question that was raised in regards to the motives of Jigsaw and his rules was answered. Which, in this genre, is often the first thing that is tossed out the window in an effort to focus on the killing. They delivered a great twist with the relationship between Jigsaw and Amanda. And the subplot was a fantastic test of the human psyche and morality.<br/><br/>I can't say I enjoyed the movie, because after seeing Hostel, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and now this- well I don't like shock/gore movies. But I was pleased with the effort and seriousness the writers and producers had to deliver a movie that would really honor the intelligence of the community that enjoys these flicks."

","How do you rate a film like Saw? Good or bad? If I say good, the Academy crowd will snub my comment and if I say bad, the fans of the series will get my head.<br/><br/>Question becomes: does it fill its promises. On that I have to agree that it hits the nail on the head. It certainly bring to the screen a series of torture-like traps and a cool ending that are now synonymous with Saw (and Halloween for some of us!)<br/><br/>Saw 2 definitely took its cues from the first one, the third one seems to look at the first 2 and build around what made them work. For example, in my opinion fewer characters and intrigue made the first Saw better, but a story that digs deeper in the mind of the killer gave an edge on the second one. So in Saw 3, the intrigue revolves around one guy that has to go through a series of tests. Certainly there are other characters for the killing quota(the first couple of deaths, while they were cool, were virtually pointless). But the film also takes you behind the scene of some of the more famous traps, how Jigsaw set the scene, painted the puppet, etc. <br/><br/>For that, I say Saw 3 was a good sequel and delivers gore for those who want it. The first Saw was a big punch in the face that almost chocked me but since, we've had Saw 2-3, Hostel (2in the making) Texas chainsaw, Live feed, and then some. Perhaps here lays my main bad criticism for Saw 3. These films are less and less about complex intrigue but more about what will be the next shocker that people will talk about for a while. It's becoming a little too gory for me, and maybe I won't even go to the 4th Saw it there will be such a thing.<br/><br/>thanks"

","Saw III - Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman Rated R for strong grisly violence and gore, sequences of terror and torture, nudity and language.<br/><br/>""If its Halloween, it must be Saw."" Pretty big words linking a horror movie franchise with a national holiday. Yet for the past two years, Saw has proved to be an unadulterated success that, in my opinion, has saved the exploitation/slasher genre. But is Saw III worthy to hold the title?<br/><br/>As with the previous two Saw films, the plot of Saw III is surprisingly deep and dependent on its surprise ending. Because of this, to avoid the risk of spoilers, I will try to review it as a whole, without delving too deep into specifics. Basically, Saw III picks up right where the second one left off. With Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) nearing death, his assistant Amanda (Shawnee Smith) continues his legacy.<br/><br/>First off, this movie is relentless. With a pace akin to that of a 50-yard sprint, by the first few minutes alone, you've already come close to seeing more death than in the entire first film. If you preferred Saw I's more methodical pacing, you may not enjoy Saw III to the same extent. More similar to Saw II in this regard, its good for what it is, but definitely not for everyone.<br/><br/>As part of the hype-machine leading up to Saw III's release, the creators boasted that it would put the other two to shame in terms of gore. Without a doubt, they did just that. This movie is just plain rude. Even a gore-hound like myself cringed at the seriousness of the brutality. If you're looking for campy, don't look to Saw III. Though, and without spoiling it, I found it ironic that the most difficult scene to watch wasn't an inventive torture trap, but rather a real medical procedure. If you feel the need to prepare yourself for Saw III, I recommend watching a few surgery shows on cable first.<br/><br/>Fast, brutal and questionably entertaining, Saw III delivers what it promised and then some. This movie, no matter how popular the franchise is getting, continues to stick to the roots of its niche genre, and for that I award it. With an ending that should feel satisfying to fans of the previous two films, Saw III breaks all expectations and continues to make this franchise the epitome of the hardcore Halloween movie-going experience."
"nosaintz","7","0","1","28 October 2006"," The rules have been broken...
","Fans of the first, rejoice. The third installment in this series ensures that those of us who've hung on for the hellish ride were not disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie's opening sets the stage for a gorier, more in-your-face adventure than the previous two.<br/><br/>Saw III's successes are many. It manages to twist, as the others have done so well, several emotional stories together around the iron rod of grisly death. It succeeds, yet again, in tossing the viewer around the canvas of the film, leaving them, up to the closing quarter of an hour, mostly clueless, thoroughly disturbed, and oddly satisfied. Its biggest accomplishment may be that very end, however. Once everything has come to the surface, the movie turns itself upside down, leads into some shocking discoveries and leaves the viewer with a pleasant haunting sensation. For those members of the audience who pride themselves on being able to figure things out: Stop trying so hard. Saw III will slip around your defenses and deliver an unexpected twist.<br/><br/>The amount of gore and violence is unnecessary and draws away from the film at points (The ""operation"" comes to mind). Understanding that this is a violent film going in, I found myself disturbed and removed from the plot in places. A few of the challenges were more trivial than in the past (The scene with the vat stands out). A final, more mild disappointment was the acting. Macfayden's portrayal of Jeff was bland, lifeless, and unrealistic at times. The film's dialogue was predictable and dry at times, but regained its footing in key places to keep the viewer mostly immersed.<br/><br/>That being said, fans of the first two will enjoy themselves immensely with this one. Those not too eager to continue on after Saws I or II may find themselves uncomfortable and out of place and may want to wait for a video release.<br/><br/>Feelings aside, Saw III is an enjoyable way to spend an evening. 7.4/10"

","We all know that every continuation of the movie is a lot worse than its prequels. It's time to forget about that. Traps are so well considered and thought-over, even more than they were in the first two Saws. And blood? Oh yes, it's everywhere. I guess that Leigh Whannell wasn't lying after all. But some scenes are so brutal and disturbing, that they make a person wonder if they forgot about the meaning of the story. It would be completely impossible to save oneself from some of those traps, just like if the chosen ones didn't even get a chance to survive. And this smells like a murder. But Jigsaw also mentions that he despises murderers. Hmm, maybe he's got a bigger plan, some plan, of whom we didn't even dream of? See Saw III and you'll find out.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie only to those who are hard core fans of Saw and Saw II, others can simply forget about it. You just won't handle the tempo.<br/><br/>9/10 (excellent)"
"gitarooman01","7","0","2","27 October 2006"," Brutality and torture...On multiple levels.
","The signature for the Saw series is to kill off characters in creative, agonizing ways and to mix it all up with sharp wit and dark, contrasting atmosphere. Saw III delivers just that, and goes out of the way to please fans of it's predecessors.<br/><br/>While entertaining, bloody, and gory as a good horror film should, it does move rather slowly. Almost like a television episode, extended for a feature film. It doesn't help, that while it's a Saw movie and the red stuff is in nearly every shot, it includes several clichés/dull moments. That being in comparison in what the movie could be. It fails in that department, mainly because the film focuses on the continuity of Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) and Amanda (Shawnee Smith). The former not at 100%, for storyline reasons and not performance. And latter, though, does a great job at filling the screen with an aura of desperation and hate, which more than anything else in the film, makes you believe you're watching ""Saw"".<br/><br/>But buying the ticket for 'III', I know the intelligence of the film was second on my mind. How these people were going to bite the dust was top priority. The camera/editing may have been too jumpy for some to see anything, but it's there in full force. Hands down, more violent and hard-hitting than the first two entries. It constantly garners that ""god, I'm glad I'm not him/her"" or ""sucks to be you!"" feeling.<br/><br/>For storyline purposes, it barely passes, but does pass, for a gap between 1-2 and the inevitable 4. If you're wondering whether or not to see it, go and see it. It's a cool film, if nothing else. And it might prove inspiration into choosing a career in surgery."
"lordofthemosh","6","0","2","27 October 2006"," Good enough, but not great.
","My summary pretty much speaks for itself: the movie is good enough for horror fare, but it's not great. The main flaw is that it tries too hard.<br/><br/>The first Saw had a great twist ending - so great that, even if you saw it coming, it still worked. The sequel, while decent, seemed to have only two goals: be more sadistic than the first and try to have an even more shocking twist. The third installment was obviously made with similar goals in mind. Unfortunately, ""the big twist"" just isn't. Sure the games are more sadistic this time around, but they are just more of the same that we have seen in recent films (Saw, Saw II, Hostel, Chainsaw: The Beginning, etc.).<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie, but I felt there was too much time spent revisiting the first two films. Not just revisiting, but rewriting. I won't give specific details here because I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but when you see it, you'll understand. The revisiting and rewriting of the earlier films works as far as the storyline goes - that is, nothing shown in this film is unbelievable or inconsistent with the first two films - it just seemed unnecessary to me.<br/><br/>The film as a whole worked well, and it was a fitting chapter for the series, but I don't think it benefited from the approach the screenwriters took. However, if you just want to see some great sadistic scenes in the ""Saw style"" and are willing to take it at face value, I think you'll enjoy it."

You could say I got my money's worth... but I wanted more.<br/><br/>Yes, it lived up to the original expectations of the first two Saws, and I'm happy with that. You will get most of what you expect or want from this movie if you compare it to the first two. After seeing it, I now wonder what they could do more if they continue production of this series. All those ideas of how to torture people must be hard to think of to make the audience cringe and creep as they watch, so it can't be that easy. What I truly wanted was a return of Dr. Gordon. That would be a good highlight, but unfortunately, they left him out and put other twists into it.<br/><br/>I mainly expected a twist, and yes we got it. It was a good one in fact. The characters blended to the style of writing and screenplay so that helped the movie a lot. I was also glad that there was more ""games"" in this movie than Saw II, where it was basically one big game. This one had a few random ones, and then one big one that set the mood for another. It went back to basics by telling unfinished business in the first two Saws, and we all needed that. A refresher can help us get into the movie better. They had a few of those, and that helped set the mood.<br/><br/>I was really happy to finally watch this movie, and I will buy it to complete my collection of Saws someday. No sequel of Saw will live up to it, and we shouldn't expect it to since it was new at that time. Anything from here on out will be ""like the original"", and that's fine.
